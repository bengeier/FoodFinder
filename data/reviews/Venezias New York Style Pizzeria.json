{"text":"I am addicted to Venezia's.

A while back, a coworker picked up a slice for me and I was not impressed.  I don't know what was wrong with me.  

I re-tried Venezia's on my lunch break four days ago, and I have eaten there every day since.  I brought my boyfriend there, and he is obsessed as well.  I am boring and usually just get cheese pizza, but my boyfriend always gets the slice of the day and raves about it, whatever it is.  I also got the Combo B last night, a slice of pizza with a small salad and a drink, and the salad was impressively good.  The Balsamic dressing was excellent, too.  Everyone should try this place out.  The pizza slices are huge, delicious, and satisfying."}
{"text":"It's painful to say this, but I would prefer Pizza Hut over this awful pizza!"}
{"text":"only pizza in area that I will gladly eat. A native new yorker, I like my pizza a certain style, and they nailed it. Good value, service, prices. All good, huge fan! I tell everyone I know, and will continue"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza (cheesy, chewy, )and wings( crispy, meaty and spicy). Menu is kinda extensive and I am excited to try it all out. Looking forward to try this pizza bowl thing that I saw( insert drooly face here)! Staff is super friendly too, always a bonus."}
{"text":"I prefer a crispier crust. Pizza was okay but nothing to write home about. New to area so will continue to explore pizza options."}
{"text":"We ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and Italian sandwiches. They were both delicious! Delivery was less time than posted. We have ordered from them several times and everything is always awesome."}
{"text":"So we went to the venizia pizza in Phoenix on Tatum and the first time was the best pizza ever so we went back and seriously it could have been a frozen pizza fr the store ...so we tried one more time and honestly don't waste your time or money ...we were so sad at the quality and the  difference when they first opened it was amazing and now it's not . Barros here we come .Never going back to Venizia..ever"}
{"text":"After finding a coupon for Venzia's and hearing great things we decided to get takeout a Friday night. We ordered over the phone a large pizza and wings. When we went into the restaurant to pickup our food the cashier said that she could not find it in the system. She apologized and told us she would grab the manager. The manager came over apologized and put our order back in. He also gave us a discount and still honored our coupon. I was so impressed how this situation was handled. Both the manager and cashier were so great. I work in the restaurant business and understand mistakes happen. I felt this situation was handled perfectly! When we got back home we ate the pizza and loved it! I was impressed at the service and food at Venezia's. We will be back and have recommended it to other friends!"}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed with this place. I had given them a great review previously for their amazing pizza and delivering services. But now after a year and months, they are suddenly \"too busy \" to deliver to my residence (I live 4.1 miles from them!) . I keep thinking its a one time thing and that next time they will be able to deliver , but unfortunately for all 10 times I've tried , they have not been able to deliver. Such a disappointment:/"}
{"text":"Yummy pizza when made fresh. Reheated slice pizza is icky. Greek salad is bomb so is the food."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place. Just solid pizza and wings - the best we've found close to our house. I love how easy it is to order online. We have never eaten in the restaurant but the service is always good when we go to pick up our food. And our order always comes out perfect. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This joint is run like a well oiled machine.  A well oiled machine that happens to churn out delicious pizza and wings.  My co-workers and I visit this location every Thursday for the amazing spicy buffalo chicken slices.

Pro tip:  if you show up around 11am you may get order #69 and a standing ovation as you go to pick up your order."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza by the slice in Arizona. Went once a week for about a year! Tell everybody to try it. If you are up for it, try the \"Big One' pizza eating challenge with a friend."}
{"text":"It's okay pizza. The sizes are kinda off, as both times I got an X-Large (16\") they've been kinda small. Like another reviewer said, it's your average NY style pizza. 

I don't really like when restaurants have to incessantly reference some TV show they've been on (in this case Breaking Bad and some Food Network show or something); it's tacky. Venezia's does this with all the style of a brat who just won the spelling bee. Once again, it's pretty simple pizza, not some place you really need to visit for its gourmet fare or its ability to make you be able to manufacture meth.

Their slices are a nice size and look pretty good for 2.50 a pop, though I'm not sure if that's just cheese or the ones they have featured in the display case up front.

Customer service seems okay. Check this place out if you want NY-style pizza, I reckon."}
{"text":"The manager Chad is awesome and always double checks my order to make sure it's right.Good food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food is alright but the service is horrible. Trying to get someone's attention to ask a question is next to impossible. Ordered wings and bread- had to wait almost 25 minutes to get them. In the end I had to get someone's attention for help and found out the food had been ready for a while they just forgot to call my name. By the time I got to eat the food was barely warm. My suggestion- try barros instead."}
{"text":"Started out with the best pizza I'd ever eaten. Crispy crust with great sauce & fantastic flavors. The margarita pizza was beyond compare. 
They have lost their way. After the first year the crust got soggy. You pick a piece up and it is so soggy and sloppy there is no way to pick it up without the toppings all sliding off. Even if you ask them to cook it completely to crispy they don't. It is yuck now."}
{"text":"My favorite pizzaria - hands down! I have visited the Ellsworth and Tempe locations. Consistently delicious big slice pizzas and fresh crunchy salads, great for lunch or dinner, any time.  I purchased the huge party pizza for a special occasion and it was a huge hit-very well priced. Our family remains as regular customers and I will definitely buy the party pizza again."}
{"text":"We get Venezia's at work in Mesa all the time. But never get it home cuz the restaurant isn't super close to our house. Ordered delivery for the first time last night at home and the food came hot and delicious! Got a supreme pizza with added red onion and jalape√±os and an order of extra crispy hot, hot wings. Delish!! Will definitely order again. Can't believe I waited so long."}
{"text":"Different people like different styles of pizza.  For me, Venezias is the best in Phoenix.  I live outside the delivery area but drive there to pick up rather than have other places deliver."}
{"text":"Wow, what a surprise.  Work ordered lunch for the office and it was awesome!  Just moved back here after 20 years and it's the first pizza place that compares to our favorite NY pizza place back east.  Great crust, great sauce, plenty of cheese.  Simply awesome.  Rosatis is dog food in comparison."}
{"text":"I go here on a weekly basis and am never disappointed with the food or the service.  The pizza is by far my favorite in Tempe with the crust always being crispy and the pasta is cooked perfectly. Clean place and quick service."}
{"text":"Good pizza for Arizona.

Arizona isn't the best state for pizza especially compared to the East Coast. This place however is probably the best bang for your buck in terms of quality pizza in the Tempe area. My boyfriend is from New Jersey and this is the best we've found so far in Tempe.

I've only ordered pickup, but the staff working there is always very friendly and kind. I've never had them make a mistake on my orders either.

I LOVE their wings! Very good if you are a wing lover and I'd recommend them even if you aren't the biggest wing lover."}
{"text":"Great pizza with nice variety!  Check their websites for coupons as they are on the pricey side but amazing pizza!"}
{"text":"I have only ordered food for delivery and it was delicious! The party pizza is huge and the prices are great. We had pizza, anitpasto salad, and the wings (bone in and boneless). Everyone loved it and will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"This is some of the best \"New York Style\" pizza I have had in Arizona since I moved here from New York...it must be the water or something because most places here in AZ have it wrong.  Delicious crust and high quality toppings.  The slices are huge.  Nice atmosphere, clean bathrooms, outdoor seating at patio tables.  I'll try the wings next time I visit...................................................tried the wings, sooooooooooooooooo good!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing how great this place is so I had to go. They claim to have real NY style pizza, so being from NY I had to find out for myself. The antipasto was good, but the pizza was a disappointment.  We got a supreme pizza and would rate the topping quality as fair. The meats were pretty bland. The crust was a bit soggy and the sauce lacked seasoning too. The cheese was just average. I'm sorry if I'm offending people that like this place, but it's not NY style & quality pizza."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our pizza from Venezia's last night. Ordering online was pretty easy, though I couldn't see any way to add toppings on only one side of the pizza. Used a coupon code for a discount which I found on their website. Went to pick up and it was ready on time, 25 mins after ordering. Pizza was very tasty (vegetarian specialty pizza) and flavorful. Generous toppings and cheese. Or only minor complaints were that the pie was a little soggy in the center -but this is frequently an issue with vege pizzas since the ingredients are more watery. The cheese bread sticks were supposed to come with marinara sauce I think, but there wasn't any in our package."}
{"text":"The first time I went was on a Saturday around 6pm. The place wasn't all that busy. I like that you can get pizza by the slice, and it's a big enough place without being huge. The atmosphere is typical of your \"new york style\" pizzerias, in my opinion.

I got a combo slice & a drink. My date got a slice of sausage pizza & a water. It was under $7 for both of us total! 

I devoured the slice. It was huge and the flavor was perfect! The crust was crunchy, which I love, and of course the classic grease dripping from the slice and possibly my face! haha.

I've been back 3 times in the last 3 weeks for lunch. It's always packed and super hopping! They have great food, they're quick, and at a really good price! How can you beat that?"}
{"text":"This is very good pizza for Arizona. I live off of Pecos so I stop in here for a slice regularly. Good specials around $5.

However if i want real NY pizza I head up the road to Nicantonis where it's not chain and he uses better ingredients and the pizza is the best in the Valley.

Keep in mind Venezias is a chain out of New Mexico i believe."}
{"text":"Very good! The party pizza is amazing very great jalape√±os . Their ranch is some of the best ever but i was disappointed because it has msg :( hopefully they can get a healthier selection in some parts. I love their spinach salad with roasted red peppers, candied walnuts,  really great!. We Love getting delivery from them . Always prompt , huge pizzas and great consistency."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Venezia's pizza in Tempe, the pizza is great and have had great service until I came to this location. The worker sold me slices that were already sold and failed to mention that it would take 20 minutes for the next slices to come out. When I went to go talk to her about it she was very rude and when the pizza finally came out she handed them in a very aggressive manner. I love the pizza here but an experience like this ruins your appetite and I won't be coming to Venezia's again."}
{"text":"I first tried this place not long before moving to Tempe. A friend of mine had constantly raved about it so when I was in the area we finally hit it up. When he told me to get the 2 slices and a drink special, I was perplexed.

\"Do you want to split an order of wings or something too?\", I asked him.

\"No, the two slices is enough food. Trust me.\"

\"Two slices? I'm a grown man, son.\"

In my stubbornness I ended up ordering some wings with the pizza. As usual, it turns out I made a mistake. When you're eating with veterans of a food establishment, listen to what they have to say. The slices showed up and they were just massive. Apparently the single serving slices come from the huge party size pizza which I'm yet to have ordered. I was full after both slices and a couple of wings, and this was despite me putting in significant effort to eat all of the wings to prove how right I was. 

The pizza itself is nothing too special, but is extremely greasy with good crust. They pack the cheese on too, which is always commendable. Basically, this is really good pizza at an affordable price. You can eat two slices of pizza and get a drink for around $5-6 and can order pizzas at a price very similar to that of the large chains.

The above is why Venezia's is great. They effectively replace all of the pizza delivery chains with better pizza at a similar price AND have single cheap meals AND have good sit down areas. It's not gourmet pizza. It's probably not better than some place you wait in line to sit down in a restaurant and pay $20+ for your medium pizza. Venezia's is just delicious, affordable, convenient local pizza. That, boys and girls, is the type of place you get the most utility from. I have probably eaten here more than anywhere else since moving to Tempe with the possible exception of Haji Baba.

They also have excellent wings and some really awesome daily specials. For example, on Fridays you can buy extra large cheese pizzas at $6 each after buying one at normal price. The staff is friendly and they have fairly late hours. Oh, Don't get the Italian Stallion pizza. The description is great but it's just not that good."}
{"text":"You want New York pizza? Go to New York. You want the best New York pizza in Arizona? Go to Venezia's. Yes this family run shop was featured in Breaking Bad, and they have shops in AZ and NM. This pizza is better than any other pizza place that claims to have New York pizza. Trust me, I'm a New Yorker."}
{"text":"This review is for my fellow Gluten free community.  I've had domino's, genos, and now Venezia gluten free pizzas...ya know the local options and I have to say that I still like Domino's and Genos better.  Domino's is also at the $15 mark but it's \"bread\"ier and then there's genos at $10 and it's twice the size of venezias.  But honestly the taste is comparable.  So needless to say...sorry GF's...they have not invented a good gf pizza yet so don't bother with Venezia. Save yr gas save your $ and your taste buds lol."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been really great. Their pizza is the best in my area, by far. Their wings are excellent. The staff are friendly. The prices are higher than other pizza places, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from here for a while now. It really is our go to pizza place. The price for the quality is good. Good wings too. The only complaint I have is when we order delivery they frequently forget our extra sauce, but that's not a huge deal. Their customer service is decent too fir it mainly being a bunch of teenager's working there."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch combos and large portions. Their pizza never disappoints, tasty sauce and toppings. The ranch is good, not watery or sour tasting like most pizza places. You can also buy their sauces. Everything here is good and they offer coupons and daily deals!"}
{"text":"This place rocks and so does their food. I haven't had any pizza or any food in here I haven't liked yet. When we lived by this place we came here all the time but if were ever in the area will definitely come back! We recommend it to everybody"}
{"text":"This place simply kills it.  They do some heavy business out of the Tempe location, and for good reason.  Their food is consistently high quality and they always have enough staff on hand to make sure you order and eat quickly in a clean environment.  The prices are very reasonable and there is rarely, if ever, a reason to gripe.  Big slice and a salad for $6.50?  Okay!  Another place that I eat at on a regular basis because they've proven that they deserve my business."}
{"text":"I like to order from this place when I get pizza to go, I have never used their delivery service so I cannot comment on that.  I usually order their x large peperoni and pick it up.  it is only 12.50 plus tax.  the crust is thin and crisp with some chew, sauce is tasty, the peperoni is what you would expect and they actually put enough cheese on the pizza so you can taste the cheese...  If you like thin crust NY style pizza you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Venzezia's, Venezia's. My boyfriend and I eat here at LEAST once a week. AMAZING food. We love it. The pizza slices are large and very filling, the salads are just delicious, and the sandwiches and calzones are some of the best ever. 

I would def recommend coming here for the pizza though. In my opinion, the best slices are the chicken pesto, BBQ chicken pizza, and the Italian Stallion. Add 6 medium wings and a drink and you cannot go wrong. I must warn you though, the wing sauce is a little bit on the HOT side so if you like things more tame, I would go with the mild sauce. The only place that has better wings is Zipp's (and that's a yelp review for another day). 

One drawback, any extra dressing is 35 cents. But let me tell you, the ranch is so worth it. YUM!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Tempe. My favorite slice the Italian Stallion I wish they had everyday but is only available on Mondays and Wednesdays. I will go out of my way just to get their pizza."}
{"text":"Let me start by letting you know that I fancy myself as being a professional connoisseur of the pizza world.
And in this world Venezia's reigns king!!
There is in no way to correctly articulate all the positive adjectives that can be used to describe the festival of flavor dancing around at the party going on in your mouth.
And to think you could ever build upon the perfection of Venezia's ?
Well they did it!  
By building a staff of wonderful outgoing people like Bianca (always smiling) and Karina. Who always remember your name and your order. 
And to me that's huge.!!
And a big props. To AJ. Who runs a great show ."}
{"text":"Excellent Experience every time I eat the food here.  Just ordered food for my team at work and everyone enjoyed their selections.  From the pizza and wings to the salad and garlic bread,  it was amazing food, delivered on time and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Fuhgettabout it...this is some damn good New Yawk style pizza!!  It's about time we had a decent pizza joint in AZ (compared to NYPD).  I think what defines this place is the variety of lunch specials around $6.  Oh yeah, did I mention the enormous pizza slices?  I usually rock the 1 slice and 6 boneless chicken wings combo and I struggle to finish it all.  The wings are decent but the chicken and pesto pizza is phenomenal, I highly recommend it.  If you're not in the mood for that, there are a variety of slices to choose from.  I'm confident you can find something you like as they have it all.  I've never had the calzones but I hear they're very good (and large) as well.  My only complaint was that prior to them remodeling, it was a bit cramped in there but since they've now expanded, it's a great place to come to for a fast, cheap and good pizza slice.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Best NY pizza West of the Mississippi. 

I found this place in Rio Rancho, NM only to find the same place in Chandler, AZ owned by the uncle. 

Beats any other NY pizza poser."}
{"text":"I have to say, after hearing about how awesome this place is from friends, co-workers, customers, etc., I was... not completely disappointed but not blown away, either. The service was great. I have no complaints there. Delivery time was average, they got my order right, and it was easy to order online.
The pizza itself is just ok. I've had better, I've had worse. I ordered the meat lover's and it was definitely loaded up with plenty of meat, but it didn't really have that wow factor I was hoping for.
I'm not sure if I will be ordering from Venezia's again. For the slightly high cost, the pizza should be spectacular. Perhaps if I stumble across an awesome deal."}
{"text":"I'm from New York and unfortunately very picky with my pizza. Most places in Arizona don't cut it for me other than NYPD Pizza, but this place is one of the best pizzas I've had in a while. It was absolutely delicious and I'll be back soon to have more of their pizza and hopefully try some of their tiramisu. :)"}
{"text":"Venezia's has the best boneless (and regular) wings in town. The \"Gold Medium\" sauce is fantastic...it tastes like a mix of hot mustard and buffalo sauce...very tasty. I love their Vegetarian specialty pizza. The slices are huge and covered with fresh veggies.

I've also had the turkey sub, Greek salad, and regular side salad (with DELICIOUS made in-house ranch). They have great China Mist iced tea as well.

So why only 4 stars you ask? They take FOREVER sometimes to make your food. 15-20 minutes when I'm ready to grub on a piece of pizza can feel like an eternity."}
{"text":"Not your average pizza joint. It may be in a strip mall, ironically located outside of la fitness, (and yea there have been times as I was leaving that I wanted to pickup a pizza) and look and smell like a standard pizza joint - but taste that pizza and tell me it is average - fantastic sauce makes fantastic pizza."}
{"text":"No matter what day I come in for lunch from work, rest assured, i will leave with everyone's orders correct. Always an awesome place for pizza."}
{"text":"Every time I order for delivery they never fail!!!  Takes about 45 min to get from ordering!! Their pizza is great it hasn't failed me yet!!"}
{"text":"It was a beer, pizza kind - of - a- night. And a mighty fine one at that! First time trying the place out... heard about it via a junk mail insert advertisement, decided to give it a go. Called in an order for pick-up. Ready in 15 minutes. Perfect. Tried the BBQ chicken and added pineapple pizza, yes I know it sounds weird, but quite tasty. 

The best part of the experience? Why seeing the YELP sticker in the window of course! Hoorah!"}
{"text":"Salad and pizza: pretty good! Price was on point, wait time not so much (1 hr+) for delivery. Worth it though..."}
{"text":"The place was good at one point but not anymore, the pepperoni pizza is not even on the pizza, they shred it or something, looks like just a cheese pizza, tacky and not worth it!!"}
{"text":"We have yet to even receive our large order (which I must say was complicated) but I was so impressed and taken aback by the customer service from the kind associate named Julie. She took the the time and patience to listen to our wants from an ordering perspective and than offered options. 

So often the thanks of good customer service goes unnoticed so I wanted to say, \"thank you from out of state California customers!\" Hoping the food is just as a delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Love this place and the diverse pizza choices!! they also have sandwiches, pasta and wings. If your really looking for large pizza for parties or school events they have a huge size pizza that is perfect for that! They also have a garage door that opens up in cooler weather. Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"We ordered a regular pepperoni pizza, wings and a 2 liter soda on a special sale day. It was a decent price, the pizza was pretty decent, and the wings were good. Good traditional style wings, good crust, great cheese. Deserves it's 4 star rating."}
{"text":"I called ahead to order a pizza thinking it would save me some time. When I arrived, they told me it wasn't ready yet and they would call my name over the speakers when it was ready. So I paid for it and sat to down to wait. After 45 minutes, I finally asked when it would be ready. I saw the worried look on the girls face when she realized that my pizza had been sitting in the warmer the entire time I was waiting. 

No one ever called my name over the speakers. When they finally handed me the pizza, they didn't even apologize for their mistake!

The pizza here is excellent, but the customer service is terrible."}
{"text":"We tried this place out for the first time this evening we ordered what the menu said was an XL size pizza which turned out to be anything but XL  it turned out to be16 inch.  I ordered artichoke for the topping there were no hearts at all, just a bunch of cheap leaves.  The cheese and sauce were the kind you find on Mall pizzas - cheap and cheerful.   I did see someone heading out of the door as I came in with what they call their party pizza, this is a whopping 25 inches and I can see how for a party that would be fun - however according to the menu these seem to run at $32 which seems high given the quality.

To review, this pizza is okay, most kids will probably eat it happily, as it tastes like the kind from most chain takeouts pizza joints.  But it is not gourmet and it is not authentic New York pizza like it claims.  If you are used to Gilbert Pizza or Flancers this is NOT going to be a good choice for you."}
{"text":"I recently went into Venezias on Ellsworth for slices and wings with some friends. Two of my buddies got their orders relatively promptly, but the other two of us sat and waited while our friends ate. They ended up finishing their whole meal before our names were called (we all ordered at the same time). I went to the front of the store to see if we had been forgotten and found our slices of pizza sitting behind the front counter. Two employees were there, arguing about the order. Apparently they prepared the pizza, but forgot our wings. One employee handed us the now room-temperature slices of pizza and said the wings would be out shortly. I ordered pizza and wings, not wings with a cold pizza appetizer. Finally, twenty minutes after our friends had finished eating their food, the employee brought us our wings. He apologized for the delay and asked if there was anything else he could do for us. I asked, \"Is there any sort of recompense you can offer for our wait?\" He looked at me like I was an idiot and said, \"I think I can do something for you.\" He came back and handed me their restaurant brochure (like the ones that come in the mail). 

I normally enjoy Venezia's but this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Cold pizza and cold customer service."}
{"text":"There was a hair in my first slice that was long and dark (not my hair). The cheese is like rubber, not cheese-y. I'd rather spend my money at clockwork pizza or big boys pizza; they are comparable in price but exponentially better in quality and taste"}
{"text":"I love this place! I live in the neighborhood and always get my pizza here. I tried a different pizza place that just opened up around the corner and needless to say I'm back at Venezias...You can charge $5 for a pizza but you can not make it taste good...also, your employees always are cheerful, helpful and it looks like a well run business..."}
{"text":"Haven't had pizza this good since I visited Rome. Great pizza and great service. I went there last night with a buddy and got a caprese salad and a large pizza. It was too much food for two people but we managed to eat all of it anyways."}
{"text":"Love the wings and pizza. If your having a party they have a huge party pizza and at a great price."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza I've ever tasted I would highly recommend going there you won't be disappointed. Wings are awesome too."}
{"text":"Oh where to begin?

The mouth watering Meat Lovers' slices? The succulent Pesto Chicken slice? The filling lunch specials? The glorious subs? Or that spectacular feeling of filling up the ten stamps on your loyalty card and getting two free slices?

You must go to Venezia's. Their slices are massive, and their Pizza Challenge will put most grown men to shame. Coupled with their wide and varied drink station, $6 will get you a meal fit for a king.

Friendly staff, awesome deals if you follow their Twitter, and most importantly, fresh iced tea & lemonade that can be mixed into an Arnold Palmer. 

I think I'll go there now..."}
{"text":"Delicious. We shared the large pie with all the toppings. The sauce was tasty, and there were plenty of the different toppings. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good consistent pizza. Friendly staff. Wings aren't bad either. Prices are decent too. I recommend this place:)"}
{"text":"With such an outstanding review from Kate M., how could I resist. Pizza is everyone's kryptonite! Isn't it?

Food (4): I opted for a Margherita slice and a Greek salad. The salad was tasty; I particularly enjoyed the dressing on the salad. For the price, it was extremely hearty and quite filling; I could've eaten it sans the pizza and been fine.

The pizza.....mehhh...maybe I should've opted for a small customized pizza vs. a slice that required reheating. My expectation was to have a slice of piping hot pizza with my salad. Instead, the slice was mediocre (though the flavor was decent).

Unless I wasn't paying good attention, which is TOTALLY POSSIBLE, I didn't see any beer/alcohol on the menu. Sorry...pizza...beer...good t.v....no brainer.

Ambiance (4): The place was clean and set-up fairly decent. I appreciated the fact that there was seating in the rear with a few televisions, which makes for a decent venue to watch your sport of choice while chowing down on pizza. 

Service (3): ok, huge issue for me. The girls at the counter we not very friendly nor attentive. The job you have is the one you chose. No one forced you to be there. If service is not your thing, perhaps you should find something else that better suits you demeanor and attitude.

Overall, I may give them another chance just to try the pesto pizza sans the chicken. But, I can't say that will be anytime soon. I'm with Kate M....there are too many pizza spots around here to stick with just one."}
{"text":"I like the PIZZA!!!  I also really dig their house dressing and the tiramisu is to die for!!!! Well almost, it's really pretty good. Wings for me are disappointing. I'd like to find a consistently good wing place, haven't so far. Being from Buffalo I do have some high expectations. I've never done their delivery so no idea there.  Staff sometimes is a bit curt but hey their a busy pizza joint, no big deal...."}
{"text":"I eat pizza very rarely but when I do Venezia's is the first place that crosses my mind.  Hands down the best pizza for your buck in my opinion.

Bear in mind I've only eaten the 2 slice special the entire time I've eaten there.  Even when its the height of lunch rush the service is impeccable and quick.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  

When I first started frequenting the establishment 5-6 yrs ago it was a hole in the wall but they remodeled a year or so ago and there are plenty of tables."}
{"text":"I've had up and down experiences with Venezias. It has potential to be one of the best NY style pizza places I've reviewed, but I've had a few disappointing experiences among my handful of visits.
 
If you're coming into Venezia's, you have to come for the slices. The extra-long slices exemplify what a good NY pizza is all about. The most impressive part of this pizza is the crust, which is crispy and chewy at the same time. The strength in the crust means it can hold up easily and maintain foldability even in those extra-long slices. Venezia's keeps the crust appropriately thin, which makes the gluten strength even more impressive. Even though it has a good textured bite, it isn't dry or rigid. Though it doesn't always jump out at you with flavor, this is a pizza crust done well with really well developed structure and cooked just right. 

The sauce brings a subtle all-around blend of flavors where nothing really dominates. There's sweetness, garlic, and a really understated spiciness that balances non-offensively. It's a very serviceable sauce. It won't knock your socks off but it does exactly what it needs to do. The pizza is topped with a good ratio of cheese, almost bordering on too much but usually within acceptable limits. Every pizza I've eaten has had really good brown spotting you look for in a NY slice. 

I've also ordered carry-out whole pies and I don't think I would recommend this. The features of the crust that I really enjoyed disappear when you put it into a box. I'm guessing the heat and steam from the pizza get trapped and kind of soften everything down. The resulting slice is still pretty good, but it is noticeably worse than the in-person extra-large slices. There's nothing too special about the sauce and the cheese distribution can err on heavy handedness and the formation of the dreaded cheese blanket. 

Perhaps the slices gave me high expectations that are not easily matched. I'm not sure if it has to do with ordering smaller sizes, but I've yet to have a whole delivery pizza I liked as much as the individual portions, especially at the price. For delivery, I might just save the extra money and get Dominos. For slices, Venezia's is hard to beat."}
{"text":"I'm not a pizza snob. I like this pizza. It's close and fresh and this pizza is fresh and tasty. This place was featured on my favorite show \"Breaking bad\". Yum!  I will be back !"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their pizza!!  My favorite side is the deep fried zucchini. It has just the right amount of batter,  and it's completely caked in it.  My favorite dessert has to be the traditional canoli.  It tastes homemade and isn't too sweet.  

All the delivery guys are rad and super nice.  If I'm in delivery range of a Venezia's location,  I will always order from them,  and even if I'm not in range, sometimes I'll go pick it up.  

Super de-lish.   :)"}
{"text":"The food is great with huge portions! Also,  when ordering through Eat24, the order was screwed up,  but the restaurant corrected the issue fast, with no problems and included a nice surprise item.  I would definitely order from them again.  Oh,  I forgot to mention that they have awesome vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Order from here often and it's always good! They recently added mac and cheese bites to the menu they are amazing! I love there ranch and honey medium wings. I took my family from the east coast and they loved it the enjoyed the crust and pesto pizza!"}
{"text":"Very good food I have had many different items here and no complaints at all.  Calzones are my fav- the salads are great. Cant wait to go again."}
{"text":"Born And raised In New York , it is hard to find Pizza that comes close to New york Pizza. We found venezia  pizza about 2 years ago and for the first year they were the Number 1 spot for us. Unfortunately lately say the last 6 to 8 months this place has become nothing but 1 disappointment after another. Their pizza has lost it\"s  flavor and consistency, one day we get our pizza burnt and the next time it is undercooked. just about every single order we have put in for delivery has been wrong. 1 thing i hate is when they tell me it is a fresh pie and they give you old pizza that has been sitting on the shelf for hours. I went to the store one day and asked if that had any fresh pizza coming out soon ( all they had was a few slices on the shelf that looked like they were sitting since early in the morning)  Girl at the counter said sure don't worry we have a fresh pie coming out in a few minutes , then went over to the old slices and took 2 slices and threw them in the oven, and try to sell them to me as fresh.I see that as deceiving a customer and offensive. this action happened at least 2 other times.   Being a cook for years in N.Y , I understand the health risk's involved in serving bad food or food that has been sitting out in the open for long periods of time. and for that reason I do not appreciate when i ask for a fresh slice or pie  and they say yeah sure and then try to give you an old slice that has been sitting on the shelf for hours. it's deceitful and insulting that they do it right in front of your face like you're stupid and did not see them do it ....we have not ordered from venezias in a while today we decided to try them out again hoping for change , and again we asked if they had fresh slices coming out or a fresh pie ..and again the counter girl said sure absolutely and then went to the shelf and again grabbed a slice that was sitting there for god knows how long and threw it in  the oven. I don't know what happened to this place it \"WAS\" definitely our number one spot for a while. I guess all good things do come to an end. : ("}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I can't find one thing to complain about with their pizzas. They only take about 10 minutes to make. We've ordered their side salad and two people can definitely share. Their employees have always been extremely friendly. They've brought the pizza to the table and noticed we didn't grab plates and they've got them for us. (the plates are paper plates that are by the drink machines) The cannolis are great too!!"}
{"text":"Gilbert is FILLED with pizza places, and this is by far one of the best. They are restricted an Italian pizzeria, no burgers, Chinese, Seaford combo, which makes it even more spectacular. We order from them time to time, their wings are wet, doused with sauce and hot to the touch. Their ranch is one of the best toppings, thin, creamy goodness all over. Carbs free pizza bowls, hot and cold Italian sandwiches, it has the best offer!"}
{"text":"Super cheap and delicious pizza! Their slices are huge; I usually order pepperoni or chicken pesto. Their Caesar salad is pretty good, too. Nothing extraordinary about it -- just good pizza and low prices."}
{"text":"Tonight I found my new favorite resturant in Tempe, Venezia's.  First I had the wings which are 50 cents on Mondays and you definatly get your monies worth. Larger than average and there sauce is similar to Hooters. Very good.
Next was lasagna which was average, but, again, larger than average portion size.  Plently for tomorrow and maybe the next day.  Comes with garlic bread.
My son had the kids pepperoni pizza which I assumed was great because he ate the whole thing. :-)
Dessert was the best part. We tried Tirimisu and Cheesecake. The Tirimisu wasn't the best I've had. I wouldn't order it again, but the Cheesecake...oh the Cheesecake. I would say it was the best Cheesecake I've ever had.  I've tried Cheesecake everywhere (i.e. Cheesecake factory, little Mom and Pop places in New York, etc)  and it is so creamy and light it literally melts in your mouth.  Plus, it's a huge piece.  Probably twice the size of what is normally served.
Venezia's gets five stars because first they quoted me 45 min. and they were there in 45 min., everything was a reasonable price espicially for there larger than average portions, and, of course, the Cheesecake was amazing! I can't wait to try the pizza next!"}
{"text":"Dear Venezia's,

I hate to default to standard letter format for this review but this is the best way that I can keep it from devolving into a total creepstore gush.

I love you because when you deliver, it gets to my house hot. I love that you have been here for me during finals. Without you, I would have lived off of Clif Bars and Vitamin Water alone. You provided me with the necessary carbs to go on thinking for another 12 hours. Sometimes, you even gave me fruits and veggies. I appreciate that, 

I didn't give 5 stars because sometimes (just sometimes!) your pizza is uber greasy...but I know it's not because of anything gross. It's all the cheese you put on there. I like the cheese, hate the grease. I'm sorry that there's no middle ground on this.

Aside from that, thank you for the tangy sauce that doesn't taste like someone dumped sugar in it. Thank you for the crispy/chewy crust (how do you do that!?) and thank you for being local.

Sincerely, 
That weird chick who looks your hot, indie boy drivers up and down

*I re-read this and realized that, standard letter form be damned, I was still plenty creepy. Sorry Venezia's..."}
{"text":"Was sketpical based on the fact that it's a chain and one of the other locations wasn't so impressive, but this place isn't messing around. Big slices, good late night slice deals certain days and it's consistently awesome pizza. Softer, less cripsy crust that my girlfriend prefers and a proper amount of grease to cheese ratio. It's in the top 3 pizza slice places in town (along with Gus's in Tempe and 40th St Pizza in Phoenix). Check out a late night happy hour slice and enjoy."}
{"text":"Such a Tempe treasure! My boyfriend and I have ordered take out from here a few times and have tried quite a few things. I would say there calzones are my favorite but their pizza is good too! They also have a good variety of appetizers and slices all day. 

Online ordering site is easy to use too."}
{"text":"I'd like to start by saying this place is hands down the best place to get pizza in the state. I'm quite the frequent flyer as I've been coming here 4 to 5 times a week for the last 8 years! And today was the day I decided to let the world know how awesome you guys truly are! There is one girl upfront in particular who inspired this review, Alex G as the receipt always says, who just blows me away everytime. She has exceptional customer service, and unfortunately that's just not as common these days. I'm normally in during the lunch rush and it never fails, she remembers my name and order. Although it's just a slice of pepperoni, salad and a drink, it's very impressive considering the amount of people that come in and out of here everyday! So shout out to you Alex G!! It may be something small but it's the small things we remember and that's what keeps me coming back, and the food of course! All of you are a very hard working group of people and I can't thank you enough for all your hard work to feed the hungry people of Tempe! Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this pizza place for about a year and a half now. Even though I graduated from ASU over three years ago, I had no idea this place existed until my husband went there one night with some buddies after a study session. He came home with a large piece of pizza that was so good, and while it was one of the biggest pieces of pizza I had seen at that time, I ate the whole thing. 

I have been hooked since. The pizza slices are huge, the slice specials are very nicely priced, and it is never so crowded I hate coming here. I have been to this location and the one in East Mesa, and I have to say that this one is way better. The pizza just tastes better, even though its the exact same pizza. We usually only get slices. We tried a whole pizza one time, but for some reason it just didn't taste the same as the slices. I don't know what that's about but in my opinion the slices are a better value anyways. My husband and I can eat dinner of two slices each, and each with a drink for under $15. And that's a win in my book. I usually end up taking one of the slices home for lunch the next day as well. So I get more than one meal out of it. 

If you want to eat some good, cheap pizza, definitely hit this place up. The pizza comes out hot, fast, and delicious. You wont be sorry you tried it."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best pizza not on the east coast that I've had.  I do have to admit eating there the pizza seems a little better.  When I've gotten delivery it just didn't have the same \"pow\""}
{"text":"Great pizza, toppings, and wings. The price for the special (2 slices and a drink) has gone up which doesn't it make the stamp card worth while anymore, but I'm fine with water. The slices are large and two easily fill you up. Definitely my goto place since I am located in Tempe, as well as in my top 5 pizza places in the valley. They also have a food challenge here which entails eating a party pizza (5 slices each) with another patron. Some dudes supposedly took this down in 7 minutes, I don't believe it."}
{"text":"Venezia's recently expanded their restaurant, and they more than doubled their floor space. The pizza slices here are huge, like HUGE huge. They pizza is good, and they have 6 or so specials. The special that I have gotten in the past is the 1 slice with 1 toping, 6 wings, and a drink. While the pizza is good, the wings are not so much. They taste way too greasy, even for deep fried wings. Maybe its the quality of the oil they use, but it leaves a taste in my mouth all day after. For now on I will get the combo with the salad."}
{"text":"Flys are everywhere! My order was made incorrectly.  However, food was good once I waited for 30 mins."}
{"text":"Amazballs white pizza! We got it loaded with fresh garlic, spinach, tomatoes!! As an out-of-town-er I was super pleased to find addictive, high quality pizza. Also loved the Greek salad. I would pick it up to get it super hot, rather than deliver."}
{"text":"ok...i only go here for lunch, and it is usually busy. I must say they move you through pretty fast. I always order the Caesar salad with chicken, and most always it is really good. I would recommend, but be leary of chicken pieces with grissel. For some reason they must have been low on da good stuff. They must have been short on dressing as well."}
{"text":"So yummy! I eat here all the time wings and pizza cant go wrong and very friendly people!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from here for 10 years now and nothing I have tried comes close to the perfect pizza and wings for a Sunday."}
{"text":"I've been on a quest for great New York pizza in the East Valley and this is the best I've had yet, and trust me I've been to a lot. I've had delivery several times and they have always been earlier than what they said it would take. The pizza is always fresh and hot when it arrives. This will definitely be my go-to place for pizza night."}
{"text":"I grew up next to a small family owned Italian market, and I learned how to love good pizza.

When I came to AZ I was a little worried I wouldn't find decent pizza. I mean, pizza with really flavorful, crispy crust and quality toppings. With all the hype surrounding Venezia's (and not to mention the flyer I got in the mail) I decided to try it out.

So disappointed. 

First, I waited an hour for the pizza. Second, I don't mean to rain on their parade but the Venezia's Supreme I got reminded me of the supreme I'd get from a very common, larger pizza chain... hmm... in other words, super salty and too many flavors clashing on one slice. Third, the crust was a bit bland and mushy like it had been sitting in the box for too long. If I wait an hour for a pizza the crust better be crispy, but sadly that was not the case. 

I'm going to give this place a second chance, though..."}
{"text":"Ask for carter to deliver your pizza! Super nice delivery guy and get the pesto pizza!"}
{"text":"Extremely average pie. Don't get the 24\" party pizza unless you are feeding a group of 8 year olds; something gets lost in translation I think in making a pizza this big."}
{"text":"A manager reached out to me after I left my review previously. Was apologetic and even gave me a large credit. It had won my business back. Until tonight. I ordered again as I had several times since my last review. Unfortunately after not seeing my order for over an hour and a half I called the store. Was put on hold a few times. The manager I spoke with called the driver and said he was close. I received a 10 dollar credit for my inconvenience. But sadly the order issues didn't end there. I finally had my food delivered. Oddly the receipt I was to sign was on a blank slip. As in just a strip of white receipt paper with nothing printed on it. For the record I tipped as I know the economy is tough. As the driver handed me my food he informed me an item was left behind. My salad. He said he was running back to get it. And he did. I finally had my order completed over two hours later. Order went out at 8:03pm. I finally got all I paid for at 10:08pm. But worst of all. The salad was warm enough it wasn't edible. I decided to toss it. As it was room temp. Even the parmesan cheese packets I asked for were missing.

I am sorry to say that even though I love your food. From your pizza to pasta to sandwiches and wings. I can't order from here anymore. I realize and understand in the food industry days can go wrong. Under staffing or sick call outs. From equipment issues. I realize that working with the public can be difficult. I myself work in management retail. A phone call to me explaining it was running late and why could have made a difference. But for me as a customer having this many mistakes where it's just about 25 to 30 percent failure rate. I won't be spending my money here. I hope others get s better experience."}
{"text":"We had take out one night that turned out to be wrong, I called in and they replaced our meal for next time. When we went in to pick up the comped order the next time, we had THE BEST customer service with their store manager AJ. He went above and beyond. He made sure to go out of his way to ask what happened last time and checked our order before we left to make sure it didn't happen again. Very impressed with the genuine customer service here! We've continued to go back again and again because of this and their pizza is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Yum. Have been coming here for years. Staff is always great and food yummy!!!  My 5yo likes the green (pesto) pizza. Haha"}
{"text":"I am pleasantly surprised by their customer service after messing up my delivery."}
{"text":"This was my second time there. I don't know what the hype is about. My gf asked me to go get some wings and pizza so I gave it a shot. I was charged for an order of wings and 2 slices of pizza and only ended up getting a half order. I don't understand how they can make a mistake when they took their time (15 minutes) getting the order together. Something which should really take like 2 minutes tops. I had forgotten to grab my drink cup and when I asked for one the girl scoffed at me. What did I do to get you so upset? Ask for what I paid for? I got home and discovered that I only received a half order of wings and on top of that the pizza was cold. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and assumed they took so damn long because they were making fresh pizza but nope. Not that at all. I even left a tip when I ordered! Will not go back to this place again. Also, how do you have 20 people working there and not be faster? It doesn't make much sense."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their NY-style pizza is always floppy and chewy and delicious. Their Garden salad is generous. Their Turkey sub is also pretty good, but there seems to be quite a wait for it. But the rest is pretty quick!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Venezias!! They have a special for an extra Lg pizza and an order of wings for $21. Their delivery is always on time and very friendly!"}
{"text":"Seriously love this pizza. I can't recommend this place enough!  Food is outstanding and yes it's pricey but it's that old saying you get what you pay for. Good job Venezia s keep it update"}
{"text":"Not THE best pizza I've ever had but the best pizza in the area :) Try the pesto pizza! For about $7 you can get 2 slices and a drink.  Not that bad.  Whole pies are a bit pricier than the corporate go to's but this place is way better and the pizzas are HUGE (as well as the slices)! They're deserts are really good too and they have a really large selection of drinks.  Yummmmmyyyy!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's a little expensive for me to eat regularly (I'm a cheapass), but I have yet to regret it.  The pizza and wings are great.  I recently had a calzone from there and it was delicious!   Decent delivery time and they have regular specials.

The establishment itself is decent.  I've been in there once or twice and it was uncomfortably busy, not to mention packed with indie hipster emo kids or whatever they're calling themselves now."}
{"text":"There are few places that I have not out-grown since my ASU days and this has to be one of them. Their salad and slice special never gets old. LOVE the combo slice and the barbeque chicken slice. Also, if you've never seen anyone complete the 24'' pizza challenge... it is a must!"}
{"text":"My favorite NY style pizza spot in the East Valley.  Great wings as well.  Also, I always grab the Greek salad."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with our pizza. We ordered an x-large pizza with chicken and tomatoes. The chicken tasted rubbery and undercooked, possibly even processed packaged chicken would be my guess. Disgusting! Our pizzas also arrived cold. We used to love this place but I don't think we will be ordering from there anymore."}
{"text":"My kids favorite pizza spot!

Slices are ready, just add the toppings.  Quick, easy, and friendly."}
{"text":"Skip the whole pizza.  If you are looking for two huge slices and a drink, look no further.  Amazing barbeque chicken and pesto chicken pizza.  The regular pizzas are not that good."}
{"text":"Went here for a late Sunday dinner and loved it! The place is so much bigger than it looks on the outside, seems to go for days. I ordered an A and my roommate ordered a C. I like that they use letters rather than numbers, made me feel a tad awkaward when ordering but who cares now.
The pizza slices they give you are gigantic and true NY style. Then but not a cracker crust, plenty of greasy, melty cheese too. For less than $7 I got 2 big slices and a drink. I'll def be going back."}
{"text":"Pizza was good and they had Thursday night football on. They also turned on the voice over the sound system so you could hear the game. Service was good as well."}
{"text":"I love their pizza but the customer service sucks.  They almost always get our order wrong, and don't really seem to care when they do."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying the food is delicious which is why I can't help but come back but the service is terrible. The past couple of times I've come I've had to go back to the front multiple times to ensure that my order is correct.  For example tonight I ordered take out, after getting the food I had to go back since half my order was not handed to me and then after getting my order and going home, to my displeasure I saw that I got 2 slices of cheese when I ordered and paid for specialty pieces.  Decided to take the hit and not make the drive back. Always make sure to check all of your order!"}
{"text":"Do not know how this place received so many good reviews. This may have been the worst pizza I have ever had. I figured I would spend a little more money, and try some place new. I figured, well, this has to be better than Dominoes, or Little Ceasars... Not even close to as good as those subpar places.

The crust was spongy with no flavor. You could taste the low quality in the cheese and toppings.

Its really bad, trust me. Do not overspend on a pizza here. If you want quality pizza, go somewhere else. If you want just an average filler type pizza, stick with the chains, they are way better than this place.

People think its good because of the name, and the authentic new york back story. 

DONT BE FOOLED!"}
{"text":"In town visiting family. Decided a no cook night and used Yelp to find this place. Kids had never tried it, but good reviews here are enough for me. 6 people, pizza, sandwiches, pasta, appetizers and dessert ordered for delivery thru Yelp.' Order was correct, on time, and very good. Everyone enjoyed their food and will eat their food again."}
{"text":"Traditional and fresh. When I think of pizza I think....heavy, greasy, and feeling like crap after. This pizza was so satisfying and well balanced. I definitely will be back!
I also lived in New Mexico, so brownie points for #breakingbad haha"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Tempe.  The dough is high quality and soft, thus the crust is fantastic.  The sauce is also very high quality and not soupy or liquid lava.  The toppings are baked in and on top of the cheese so when handling the big slices, everything stays together. Great bang for the buck with the combo specials and the daily specials are not too shaby either.  

Now to the calzones. Oh my lord the calzones. Nuff said.  

Service is good. Atmosphere is good. Everything is good."}
{"text":"Love love love their pizza. When my roommate first introduced it to me I gained 20lbs in a month. If your from the east coast n just moved to tempe to go to asu and looking for an amazing pizza place this is where to go. I just wish they had later hours :("}
{"text":"Yum! Love this place! We recently moved super close to a location so it's our new go to. We enjoy the pizza combos, wings, Mac n cheese bites, and desserts. Staff is helpful but not always the most chipper"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza.  The slices are large, and the lunch specials are pretty darn reasonable.  When it comes to wings, I'd go with the medium, unless you're in the mood to sweat, in which case the hot are a spicy treat.  The place is pretty small, so it's not the best for large groups.  Grab it to go or have it delivered if you're with a bunch of people.  

The folks running it are swell, the food usually comes out quick and the pie is great, not too saucy, and perfect when you're in the mood for NYC style pizza."}
{"text":"Kenny and Joel are awesome! Super helpful, super attentive, and just awesome overall! Great food!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Mesa (Maybe this side of NY, but definitly AZ)! Friendly staff, big slices, Awesome pizza, great salads, yummy wings! (The only thing they have missed are fried mushrooms. I will keep asking too, cause I know they would make those amazing as well) I HIGHLY reccomend the Lunch specials. I think I visit this place about once a week! I try to hit it on Tuesdays when the Bianco pizza is on special; it is my ALL time favorite! One slice of that and a Greek salad and I am in HEAVEN!!!  I do have to say that I liked the greek dressing better before they bottled it, but this stuff is still the best going! 

The New York style crust is amazing! crisp on the bottom with a good amount of chew. The sauce is tangy and has the right amount of spice. The Sweet Chili Wings are my faxorite (though not spicy at all. My 7 year old LOVES them, too). The sandwiches are also amazing! HUGE!! The Meatball is my 10 yr. olds favorite, but I prefer a more authentic cold Italian or even the Chicage Beef is an excellent choice. Ok, so I guess my summary so far is that no matter what you pick, you can't really go wrong! It is all amazing! And if you have a group the 24\" Party pizza is the way to go!! Just be sure it will fit in the car!"}
{"text":"I agree with the previous poster Jeff P. that Venezia's isn't the most authentic NY style pizza around.  The cheese should be stringier, and the crust should be slightly thinner, less chewy, and more crisp (or at least as much like my old favorite pizza joint in NYC, \"Little Vincent's\", on the U.E.S.-- 72nd St. and 2nd Ave), but it's pretty adequate in taste and value for money.

AZ has quite a few Chicagoland migrants, and we tend to get to get the thicker, un-foldable slices, which are also good, but if you want something resembling a decent NY style pizza, Venezia's is a pretty good alternative.  3 Stars in Arizona, but only 2 if we were in NYC...."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza.  The staff could care less about you and your love for it but its so damn good they know you'll be back regardless of them paying attention to you."}
{"text":"This place sux, I ordered 3 orders of sweet chilli boneless wings, and when I opened the box when I got home the wings were bone dry."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Tempe!  I highly suggest the chicken pesto pizza, and don't forget some wings and ranch!  We usually get it delivered, which takes 45-60 minutes.  If delivery were faster I would rate 5 stars."}
{"text":"Hands down,  the best pizza i have ever had. I have tried a sandwich once and it was very expensive and not worth the cost but the pizza omg is excellent."}
{"text":"Four stars: I do not give 5 stars unless everything was PERFECT.  It is close with Venezia's and if I could give a half star I would.

I have never been to the place, have always ordered delivery.  Even though I am technically outside their delivery area they have no problem getting my food to me.

Pizza: Good, better than most places.  Slightly greasy but that is the kind of pizza this is.

Wings: Awesome!  Love the crispy (no breading!!  Yay!) skin and their sauces are premium.  I especially like that when I order the Honey Hot they send the honey in a separate container.  Might just be me, but I think they taste better with the honey added right before eating.  And their Hot is just my level of heat.  The lips are still tingling 5 minutes after I am finished eating."}
{"text":"Pizza is great and so are their wings! My only suggestion is to either dine-in or pick up your pizza. Their delivery charges are ridiculous and the pizza is rarely hot when it arrives. I called the last time we had it delivered and it arrived cold and stale. The manager actually admitted that due to our location we were the 3rd stop on that delivery route. He did not apologize and even stated how far we were. If we are so far, then take us off of your delivery radius or stop loading the deliveries this way."}
{"text":"It was a busy lunch crowd but all the staff was friendly and working quickly. My little ones kids meal took longer than our slices of pizza, the gentleman behind the counter realized this and went the extra mile by checking on it and bringing it to our table. Thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza! Great prices and the HUGE 24\" pizza is great for parties or, should I call it now... the 2010 SUPERBOWL PARTY feat OUR AZ CARDINALS!!! (one can only hope). Last superbowl, i ordered (2) of the party pizza's, and it was more than enough for 10 people. 

The toppings are fresh, and the dough is excellent. The cheese and sauce are both above average.

After rennovating the interior, this place went from college late-night hang out, to modern semi-upscale establishment. 

The employees are still friendly and the pizza, still excellent. Wings get a 7/10 on my scale. pretty dang good."}
{"text":"I'm overly annoyed with the LITTLE GIRLS that work in this place. Either your high and not paying attention or you just can't follow orders. I have been going to this pizza place since it's opened on this corner. I go at least 2 times a week and the last 6 months the little rats can't get it right. I only ask for whatever pizza is out and boneless mild bbq wings. Every time for years! You have the sauce in the menu yet no one every knows what the hell it is and you always give me bone in ALWAYS! I THIBK THEY THINK I WANT FREE FOOD AS MUCH AS THEY FUCK IT UP.  Honestly I don't care about free or not I just want what I want I paid for it! I hate them they ruin to many of my 15 hour work days with this foolishness! Bye forever guess I will have to go back to Slices were there are no wings and better pizza choices."}
{"text":"Are you gluten free?  Good news is, there is a good gluten free pizza in town. Good not fantastic. 10 inch for 13 bucks. Yeah. We're use to paying thru the nose for GF aren't we?  Take it home and dress it up more with your own toppings , what the heck! 
Before I acquired my allergy to wheat I would order the usual pepperoni pie. Really wonderful hot. Key word is HOT."}
{"text":"Good pizza but not amazing.  Quite a big selection though.  Co-worker said calzone was very good."}
{"text":"This was for carry out.  The women up front were quite nice, and the garbage was cooked within 15 minutes.  

Well, you get what you pay for, I suppose.  The cheese is like rubber, but the crust is chewy.  Would I pay $18 out the door for a 16 inch \"specialty\" pie from them again?  Mmmmm, perhaps for my kids or someone who doesn't know that cheese comes in something other than velveeta.  5 year old  kids pool party, or food for the already inebriated...all else, you not go back more than once."}
{"text":"First time here. Friend of mine kept raving about their wings and when looking on yelp for a place to eat this happened to be close so we decided to try it. We ordered two order of wings and the party pizza for four. Careful as this is way too much food. The pizza feeds an army. The wings were fantastic and the pizza is top notch. We live it in the west valley and probably won't drive 40mins just to get here but this will definitely be on our short list when we are out here."}
{"text":"First time customer, glad I tried them!  Not knowing what their pizza would be like and the fact that they served by the slice made my decision easy.  I ordered 2 slices to start with, one had bacon, tomatoe, mushroom and onions and the other had meatballs, peperoni and tomatoes.  They were excellent, the crust was thin but not like a cracker, had a nice chewiness to it with a bit of crunch.  Nice home made sauce, not sweet like some or too spicy like others.  My wife says she has found a new pizza place and I'm sure we will be regulars.  Our third slice had meatballs, anchovy and tomatoes.  We were amazed at the quantity and quality of the toppings.  Of all the toppings, the meatball was our favorite.  The slice comes off of a 24 inch pizza so it is plenty to eat at $2.25 a slice and 35 cents per topping.  They make one great NY style pizza!!!  On each table there was parmesan cheese, oregano, red peper flakes, garlic salt and salt and pepper.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Found Venezia's on the Bing app on my phone.  The place was large, roomy, and clean.  The staff was patient and friendly even when we changed our minds 3-4 times when we were at the register.  

Their pizza and wings were good enough to merit several visits back during one week."}
{"text":"I dub this place the best pizzeria I have tried yet. While I still love Grimaldi's and Barro's, the selections are more varied here which I love. 
Venezia's has a New York pizza stop vibe to it with the brick walls, leather booths, etc. that you'd see in most classic restaurants. It can be busy on the weekends but it's totally worth the wait.
Staff are always very friendly and helpful. I especially love the manager at this location; he's super easy to talk to and makes sure your order is correct.
The food is amazing. The crust is thin and chewy (which I love) on the inside with a thicker, crispy crust on the outside. You can choose from 3 sauces (not including the specialty pizza sauces): Pesto, bianco, and regular marinara. The bianco is a ricotta-based sauce that is incredibly delicious and my friend and I love to get this one (the other two are great as well but I usually get a specialty sauce). Something cool is they offer pizza salads, which is a pizza with a salad on top. I haven't tried it yet but I want to. Their salads are fresh and light, making a great compliment to any meal. Even the smalls are bigger than you'd think. Wings are good, tiramisu is good, everything is just good. It's one of those places where you walk out not regretting a penny spent or a calorie taken in. 

Try It you haven't!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix from NYC and have been avoiding eating pizza while I am here. However, I was told by more than a few people to try this place. Regretfully I made the trip today to try the pizza. 

I went over to the counter to order and the girl asked what I would like. I said I'd like a regular and they looked at me like I was an alien. I clarified by saying a plain slice. But, still no change. Saying a cheese slice finally got me somewhere. Now I know why out of staters in NYC always say cheese slice.

After I paid. I went to sit down and waited what felt like forever. I was beginning to wonder if they were making each slice from scratch. I walked over by the counter to see what's going on and I see a conveyer belt style pizza oven. Now if you go to any pizzeria in NYC there's no way you'll see an oven that looks like that. It's usually Bakers Pride. Matter of fact the only place I had previously seen one of these ovens before was a Costco. This is when I knew I was about to be disappointed and I understood why it was taking so long they just thew everything in there and waited for it to come out. 

Finally, once my slice was ready I went up to the counter to get it. I was greeted by the biggest slice I had seen. This thing was the size of two regular slices in one. Which I guess wouldn't be a bad thing. If the pizza was actually good. 

Looking at the pizza, you can immediately tell this has nothing to do with a New York style pizza. The dough is way too thick and the crust way too soft. I'll agree with one of the other reviewers  on here. This thing was pretty much an equivalent of a Costco pizza. Actually, scratch that, you'd be better of getting a pizza from Costco not only does it taste way better - it's also cheaper.  

After taking a bite from the slice I'm pretty sure I got 5x my daily value of sodium. There was more salt than pizza. I love pizza and I pretty much eat it whenever I can but, this was one of the worse slices I've ever ate and it was the only slice I threw away without finishing. Also what's with the substandard ingredients? Having Kraft \"Parmesan\" instead of the real stuff is just bad. 

Finally, anyone that claims this is anywhere close to New York style or any pizzeria on the East Coast is fooling themselves. In NYC you can get a slice for the price of a bus/train fare. Here it's somehow more expensive and it's way worse."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, quality food. Delivery times are quite long so dine in or pick up if you can."}
{"text":"I called to check the status of my order after waiting for an hour and fifteen minutes. The girl who answered seemed to be trying to get me some answers which I appreciate however after being put on hold a few times she told me that she was transferring me to the manager; which is when they hung up on me. I was going to call back after another 10 minutes after the call ended to tell them I didn't want pizza anymore but decided to wait. So I ended up waiting for an hour and a half for a cold large pizza and dozen wings. Worst 25 dollars ever spent. 

I don't order pizza that often but Venezias has a pretty good reputation, I just wasn't expecting this.

Other than how my order was handled the quality of the pizza was on par with little Caesars but they don't rip you off."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. They have some of the best pizza in Tempe. Its always fresh, the prices are affordable, and if pizza isn't your thing, the menu has plenty of other things. Everytime I walk in I am greeted with a smile, and Everytime I have friends in from out town, Venezias is a must. If you haven't been here, make sure you try it some time. My favorites from here are the wings, sausage slices, and the greek salad. The only thing I have bad to say is that they charge for ranch, but even the ranch is worth it."}
{"text":"I give them lots of credit for offering a low carb pizza bowl.  it's crazy rich.  However,  I found it hilarious they asked twice if I'd like to add a bread stick with my gluten free bowl.  I got real silver ware with mine, but my companion only got plastic.  I would say \"no atmosphere.\""}
{"text":"Love the pizza.  Great prices. Take a little long for delivery but it's well worth the wait. Absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza at a reasonable price.  The staff is always friendly and responsive.  The food comes out quick and the quality is always great, even when they are busy.  Can't recommend them enough."}
{"text":"My favorite straight-up NY style pepperoni pizza in town."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to get a few slices and wings. Great selection of slices available pretty much throughout the day and the wings are fantastic. The only reason they don't get a full five stars is if you get a whole pie it's usually very well done (raw) and no beer."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! The pizza and wings are amazing. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Ordered a few things online from grubhub for delivery, it got here pretty fast the deliverer told us the other half of our order got mixed up and he had to go back to the store to get it we werent mad. He gave us our 2 main dishes we ordered the baked ziti and the chicken parm sandwich which was delicious  and told him to take his time coming back because all that was forgotten was a calzone and soda. 2 minutes after he leaves i get a call from the restaurant, im not sure if it was the manager or just an employee but he told me he was sorry a mix up happened and what can he do to make it better, a free dessert.. etc.. I told him don't worry about it mistakes happen you dont need to give us anything free just for a simple mistake. Long story short wow venezias thank you so much for great customer service! Not too often do you get a call at 930 pm on memorial day apologizing for a mistake that was made when it couldve been blown off and not cared about. We are all about kindness and customer service so thank you!"}
{"text":"Horrible they won't even consider to go 2 miles from their range, just lost a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It has turned into our go-to pizza delivery in the last few months. It's not always the fasted for pickup or delivery, but we think it's worth the wait. 

We've only tried their pizza and salads. Love the pizza and we have tried a few different kinds. The salad is just ok in my opinion. The last time my husband went in for pickup he said the wings looked really good, but we haven't tried them yet. They also have amazing ranch. We will definitely keep ordering from here."}
{"text":"The fact that this place delivers to my place and does so with 20 minutes is great. Pizza is good. Wings are good. Beware though that the mild wings aren't spicy in anyway. Will have to try the medium next time. Good late night grub."}
{"text":"Usually our first meal when we visit Mesa. Great pizza and Italian salad. Usually very busy so we get it to go. Ready in under 30."}
{"text":"The pizza here is consistently good.  Admittedly, it may not be comparable to east coast pizza places, but is definitely one of the best places in the valley for New York style pizza.  In my experience, the staff has always been pleasant and it's always busy with both carry out and dine-in customers.  Really great by the slice options at a great price!"}
{"text":"Good, not great, and that's being nice. The last few times we have been there were much better. Tonight, the restaurant smelled funny. Should have known by that, that the experience would be about the same. Ordered 3 pizzas (yes 3) The kids only eat cheese, hubs wanted something spicy and I was going VEG.  With a salad and $68 later, we were less than impressed. Undercooked dough!!!!  This is thin \"NYC\" style pizza I thought. How is it under cooked and super doughy??? Salad was not as good as I remembered ( anti-pasta). All around disappointment. We could have went to many other places for that $68. May try again, most likely not. :( You use to be SO GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"NY style.  big and greasy....in the best possible way.  meat lovers is awesome.  the wings are good.  lunch specials are really special.  go to pizza place for pick up....  delivery... or stop in and see the food challenge wall of shame."}
{"text":"this was our favorite in Albuquerque and its here, soo glad and so good... the pizza is  awesome and the hot wings super spicy!"}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza in the Valley! I lived around the corner from the Chandler location for a few years and went all the time (delivery was always on time and arrived hot too). I still go out of my way to get pizza there."}
{"text":"Best NY style slice in AZ.  I used to go 2-3 times a week when I lived around the corner but now I cant remember the last time Ive been in.

What i do remember is this,  the slices are huge.  One was usually all it took and I would rarely finish two.  super cheap too, a slice and a drink for only 5 bucks is a no brainier.

If you want trendy foofoo pizza go to cibo or bianco, if you want authentic Italian go to Pomo, but if you want a good ol NY slice go no where else but Venezias."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Great pizza but is it worth it.

No order in how customers are taken care of. Will think twice before coming back."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a slice!  Out-of-tower, glad I stopped by.  I wish I had something similar close to my home town..."}
{"text":"I usually only write a review if I have something positive to say but tonight I had a really bad experience with Venezia's Pizza on Ellsworth. I ordered an Italian Hero which was listed under their COLD SANDWICHES. It came toasted and with the cheese melted. It was supposed to have Italian dressing on it, it came dry. I also ordered a side salad and they didn't send the dressing for the salad. So I called the restaurant to let them know about what was wrong with my order and my hope was that they would make it right and send it back out. Well instead of an I,m sorry for the mistake the kid on the phone began arguing with me telling me that it was made properly. He said that even the COLD sandwiches are toasted. I told him that it doesn't say that anywhere on the menu and that I wouldn't have ordered it if I had known that. He just kept telling me I was wrong. Never once did he apologize or offer to make it right. So finally I mentioned the dressing not being on the sandwich and he said it should have come on the side. I told him it didn't and he just continued to argue with me and tell me how they were right. He actually was arguing so much I couldn't get a word in and had to hang up just to get him to stop arguing with me. I know I should've called back and asked for a manager but I was so taken aback by him arguing with me like that that I just gave up. I paid $30 for food I didn't eat and wound up having a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I will never order from them again. They have seriously poor customer service. I'm a server and know mistakes are made all the time and also agree that the customer is NOT always right but this kid was way off arguing with me like that. I do not recommend ordering a sandwich from this place. I gave it 2 stars because my son was happy with his pizza. But I will go back to ordering my sandwiches from Bella's Pizza and Pasta right across the street from this place."}
{"text":"Awesome. Great taste, big slices, good \"slice\" specials with a rewards program (10 slice special combos = 1 free!)."}
{"text":"Really yummy pizza. The flavors were splendid. True New York style and perfectly cooked. The thickness of the crust was great and it was so good I ate every last bite instead of leaving the end. Bookmarked and definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place that delivers to the girlfriends house. yeah i COULD get hungry howies, i COULD get Domino's but i want real pizza from a much smaller company. the price seems fair for what you get, their lunch special seems like a great buy, thier wings are pretty damn good to, i like all the specials they have, but ordering on the website can be a little tricky. I'LL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices.  We love to come as a family. Pizza and hot sammies are the best."}
{"text":"Venezias makes delicious food - that's why I keep going back, and if that was the subject of this review, they would get at least a 4.  Unfortunately, this review is the result of the past three to go orders this year being fulfilled incorrectly.

I'm not sure if their employees don't care or maybe some are a part of an illiteracy hiring program, but it's getting to be ridiculous (if it will allow me to attach a picture, I will).

My most recent order was for a turkey sub on whole wheat, no onions and with a side of italian dressing.  When my husband went to pick it up, I asked him to double check that they included the dressing because the last two times they forgot.  I'm glad that I did, because it wasn't included (again).

Then, when he got home we discovered that they gave him a turkey on white, with onions and taped to it was a receipt in large print: Italian [dressing], wheat [bread], no onions.

First world problems, I know.  \"My delicious food isn't what I ordered.\"

I may still order from them, but I do hope in the future they give READING THE ORDER the old college try.

2017 Update: Picked up food to go, and when I got home I realized the wing order was not complete. I called manager, and they sent wings to be delivered, which was appreciated, but working in a \"double checking\" process before leaving the store is a customer service that will never be a waste of time."}
{"text":"OMG, I found New York quality friggin' pizza, and they DELIVER to my house!!  (yep, they're the fold-'em-in-half and wolf 'em down while you run for the subway kinda slices...)

We also got the spaghetti and the meat lasagne.  Both are excellent, the lasagne especially so.  Breadsticks, cheese garlic bread and regular garlic bread:  all really good.

Small hitch with a missing item in a large delivery order, which they handled so quickly and so perfectly, that I'm calling the service excellent.  

A great, independently owned NY style pizza place with amazing food and great service...  Heaven in Tempe!!

PS  You can order entirely online, with a really good user interface that includes pictures that match what the food really looks like.  I love that."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed today to find out Venezias no longer serve the Empire State Pizza. I have been a regular customer for 4 years and that was my go to order. I always bragged and recommended Venezias to friends and family. Without the 10 topping Empire State its just another neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"This place is great! They make pizza, wings, sandwhiches, salad and pastas, though I have only ever tried their pizza. They prepare a good variety of pizzas to choose from plus their slices are huge. So far I've had the pepperoni, pesto chicken, and buffalo chicken - all excellent (and great crust). They offer a \"party pizza\" which is 24\". The place gets really busy during lunch hours and it may take awhile to receive your order, but there is plenty of seating. Just be aware of the idots that stand in front of the fountain machine."}
{"text":"Lived in Az for 35 yrs and never knew this place existed. It was great! They don't skimp on the cheese, the added items on my pizza were plentiful and actually tasted like veggies. The crust was chewy and yummy. Definitely be on my list for # 1 pizza when in Tempe again."}
{"text":"I really am not sure why everyone tells me this place is so good. I've given it a few tries & each time the crust is really spongy & Always get shorted on toppings. Not real New York style pizza in my opinion."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their pizza. Great atmosphere and very fun place to be. They sell pizza by the slice also which is awesome. They are always busy but it doesn't seem to make the wait any longer which is a plus!"}
{"text":"So good! First time having NY style pizza. Very pleased. Bang for your buck! Great wings!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza places I have had in Phoenix! I am so happy to have a pizza place that is just consistently good and has fair prices. I have tried their cheese and combo slices. They also have very delicious wings, but the hot is not even spicy enough for me. Their service is ALWAYS fast. I am surprised they are not busier than they are! My boyfriend and I frequent here regularly.  I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good wings, good pizza. I was really impressed with how fast they get through their orders on a busy Friday. The only thing that they are missing is beer. I know I am completely bias on this issue but pizza and beer just make the meal perfect. Overall, great food."}
{"text":"This was my second time trying Venezia's. First time was during an office staff meeting. I had chicken pesto both times.

I am normally a very harsh pie (pizza) critic... Having been born in Europe, I have high standards set for what a pie should taste like.

However, Venezia's has definately been able to live up to my grand expectations. I must agree with the rest of fellow Yelpers, this pie is to DIE for!! We definately been blessed with a slice of PIZZA HEAVEN!! :)

So... get in your vehicle and take your hungry butt to Venezia's. You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Wow, great pizza.  I had the pepperoni and the sausage... The sausage is especially good.  The traditional cannoli and the tirimasu were also excellent."}
{"text":"Doesn't get better than this! We order from here at least once a week. My kids love it and ask for it all the time. Anything on the menu is amazing! Our favorite is to order pizza and wings as a family. When I dine alone I'll get one of the slice specials. Their salads are also really good if you're looking for something on the lighter side. I would recommend the Greek salad. Their daily specials on slices provide a different option everyday. My favorite day of the week is Thursday... Italian Stallion! When I was pregnant I had to be there every Thursday for my fix!"}
{"text":"Party pizza is enormous!!!! We bring our family from other countries here. They can't believe how large that pie is."}
{"text":"I came here 5 days in a row, and I wanted more after! I love coming here! I'm a frequent customer! The staff is super friendly! The pizza is amazing and the ranch is lovely! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Great delivery service! 

Great pizzas! We order a \"custom\" pie every time and they always get it right!

Great mild wings!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, it wasn't New York style, it was closer to Papa Johns style pizza but it was still good. Medium wings had great flavor, I really enjoyed those.

One Nibble, everyone knows the laws, we try them all until we've had them all! Grade of the pizza 5.6."}
{"text":"Great Pizza at a great price! Two slices and a pop for less than $7. I'll be driving there for a pick up order soon! Good job!"}
{"text":"I never knew about this place until I started working in Tempe and found out that every Thursday, my co-workers come here for lunch and I'm happy to say that I love this place! The slices are so big that I only need a slice to fill me up. My favorites are the buffalo chicken pizza (only served on Thursdays) and the chicken pesto pizza. If you're a fan of chicken on pizza, I would definitely give these a try!"}
{"text":"The pizza is so yummy and the slices are giant! They should invest in satellite radio,  however.  The last two times I was in there,  there were radio ads for Domino's pizza,  and more commercials than music.  Of course I don't eat there for the music,  but radio commercials suck."}
{"text":"I love this pizza place. Venezias is one of my favorites here in the valley. I was extremely excited to actually order and now sit in their new dining section. This will now be more of a hot spot for me and my family. Great Job Venezia's..."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  They make a really good thin crust  NY style pizza.  We also like the wings ALOT!    We do delivery 9 times out of 10 and they are fast and the pizza and wings hold up well.  I don't care for the BBQ wings but my kids love them.  We all like the honey hot wings. 

They hands down have the best lunch special in town. We were here the other day and got 3 slices plus a drink and 2 waters for $10 plus change.  I had a slice of the special pizza with sausage, pepperoni and jalape√±os. I'm usually not a fan of sausage but this stuff was really tasty.  The slices are huge too.  I left full but if your a huge eater you might want 2 slices.  They are local too so I like to support local businesses."}
{"text":"Delivery took one hour but I asked for extra dressing on my Greek salad and they gave me two. The delivery guy was super cool he said it was half an hour drive so I gave him a phat tip. Still one hour for average pepperoni and jalape√±o they can do better."}
{"text":"This is the best tasting pizza in all of Arizona. I'm from NY and I was afraid I'd never find NY tasting pizza again and after watching Breaking Bad realized there is a Venezia's by me. I tried it and was blown away. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"There is good pizza, and then there is amazing pizza! Venezias is AMAZING pizza! I try to get something new every time i go there, and every time im satisfied beyond my wildest dreams! Thank you for making this place, youll have my buisness forever! Reccomended to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. Food is awesome and the staff is fun.  The dining area is too small but it makes a fun place to eat."}
{"text":"Had a brief miscommunication regarding the food and its initial condition upon delivery. Venezia's went above and beyond to make up for it. Their food is awesome and I will be a repeat customer no matter what. Props to the management, great food and awesome folks behind the scenes. 

Great food, great people. Love this place!"}
{"text":"My problem with Venezias is they're so unpredictable! About once every 3 times ordering their food is great, which is why we've continued to order. However, the other 66% of the time the food is either cold, tastes like it's been sitting for hours, or my favorite and most common mistake - food is missing! Almost every time I order a chicken ceaser salad they charge for the chicken but forget to include it. They will credit my $3 but that doesn't do me any good...  the chicken is really the only reason I agree to let my husband get pizza from there when we want delivery!  So, we probably won't be taking the chance on them anymore... too bad they can't get their management team to crack down and make sure production isn't lacking."}
{"text":"Took pizza to go twice-delicious and consistent quality. Local is always the way to go! Had a party of about 14, fed them easily with their two HUGE 24\" pizzas. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Stayed in the Tempe Area for spring training baseball. Ordered for delivery to hotel and arrived ahead of scheduled time.  Ordered a large supreme with breadsticks.  Pizza was perfectly cooked, fresh vegetables; the sauce was just right and crust was very good.  Also got the breadsticks which were excellent too.  Great pizza and delivery...highly recommended!"}
{"text":"When a business asks for another chance you should always accommodate when possible. We are all human. I went in today and their quoted time was spot on as well as the food was fresh and very tasty. I'm glad I got this other side of your business as I will definitely be back for future pizza and wing orders. Staff was very helpful and pleasant. Just work on those crazy event nights and weekends so others don't take away my initial thoughts as you have proven you are much better than that. Thanks Venezias!"}
{"text":"What a bad place to eat, pizza is so bad taste is not good, a lot of cheese on pizza you can get cholesterol 
Bad pizza 
Bad pizza 
Don't waste your money better to go and get some in n out burgers"}
{"text":"While the pizza was most definitely delicious, the process of trying to order cheeseless pizza was so clunky that even though the cashier and the manager confirmed the order, the cook still put mozzarella on it. Still four stars, however, since once this was brought to their attention they gave us another pizza, free of charge.

It was also very clean and had some awesome menu choices. Definitely planning on eating there again."}
{"text":"Great pizza, good prices, nice atmosphere, but I took 1 star because the salad looks like it was chopped by a blind person, and it's also lame. But great place though!"}
{"text":"This is my 400th review, so I chose a good one.
I keep getting coupons for this place. People I know(friends) say yeah, it is OK. Nothing great. It is alright.
So one day it was raining and cold. I was out running errands and did not want to mess up the house cooking when I got home.

So I had a coupon so I came here to Venezia's!
First I called on the phone to order a large Pizza and some wings.I have been craving Wings,soooo.
Anyway, I got there a little early. Parking for pick up right in front,very nice.
As I sat inside looking around it was clean and well maintained.
Counter for napkins, condiments and such, clean and well stocked. 
They were busy pick up orders, people coming in to get a slice, etc.
They handle it very well. Everyone is calm and it runs very smoothly.

One girl that was cutting Pizza and boxing every thing up made it all look so easy.
She was wearing a hat and had tattoos,I say that because, I do not know her name.
But, she was getting those orders out so quickly and efficiently/ I was amazed how she made it all look so easy. Bravo to her, she rocks.
The smell inside was really good. Italian Food on a cold day smells fantastico!

When We sat down to eat at home. It was fantastic! I love their Pizza. Their wings were meaty and spicy! This is it , I have found my new Pizza Heaven!
I am so excited.

Also I read the menu and took a to go menu home, I can't wait to try all the other items, I am sure they are just as wonderful!"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews here and having lived in NJ I really thought this place would be a true NY style pizza...As soon as I saw the oven I knew this would not be the case.  They use a Middleby Marshall oven (same type used by Dominos where the pies are cooked on a conveyor).  The real pizza joints in NJ / NY will generally use a Bakers Pride where they drop the pizza, close the oven door in and turn it occasionally with a pizza peal.  At the risk of sounding like a pizza nerd, I think the crispiness and flavor of a pizza cooked in the Bakers Pride is superior with the Middleby giving a rubbery texture.  The pizza here was somewhat akin to a Dominos pizza.  Now they did give me a lot of cheese and were generous with the toppings but for me the crust is crucial...and this crust was just ok.  Sorry Phoenix but Venezia is nothing like you get in NY"}
{"text":"Lets start with the bad first then we can go on to the good. 

Bad- I wish they served beer... why? Well what goes better with pizza and wings? That's right... an ice cold beer. 

Good- I absolutely adore the pizza... it's super delicious. I usually get the slice + 5 wings + drink... my slice is usually pepperoni or mushroom... it has fantastic flavor for a great price. It's by far my favorite pizza place in Tempe. I also love that they offer a food challenge here (not that i would be able to do it, or even attempt it) I love watching people do food challenges... it's just so fascinating. haha

I am in love with their wings... I usually order them in HOT. I thought by reading the menu that the wings would be really hot, but I was surprised how comfortably hot they were. There was no hesitation when eating them. 

I know I'll keep coming back for more... it's my go-to pizza place. :D"}
{"text":"Best food ever!! We have been going to this Pizza place for about 5 years now and still love it just as much as the first day we stumbled across this place. We highly recommend them to anyone and the location on ellsworth and Guadalupe has the most friendliest staff you could ever find. They know us well and make every experience better then the last. You guys are amazing!"}
{"text":"I knocked off a star, because I felt so upset last time I was at Venezia's, which was a couple of weeks ago. I am vegetarian, and I asked for the veggie pizza. I paid, got my drink, sat down, and took a bite out of my pizza only to find out I bit into a pepperoni slice. There were pepperonies underneath the cheese, so I didn't see it. I love Venezia's, but they need to do something to solve this problem, so they will not repeat it."}
{"text":"Orded a supreme for take out.  We enjoyed it except for mushrooms were missing and was cold when we got it home but not their fault.  I'd like to try having it piping hot at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious! We ordered a slice of the pesto chicken and a buffalo chicken sub. We loved them both. We will be back soon! Great specials also!"}
{"text":"Totally worth the money. It's not the absolute best pizza by any means, however, it is very good a more than affordable. 

The boneless wings are really good and their peppercorn dipping sauce is amazing. If you need a lot of pizza to feed a big group, this his your best deal for the money!"}
{"text":"When I used to live in Tempe, this was my favorite spot for Pizza! I always thought it was so funny how it was right next to LA Fitness. The pizza here is amazing and their combo's are so cheap. I think it was like 2 slices and drink for like $6. Their wings are really good too! Try the wings with the gold sauce! They do charge you .75cents for the ranch though, but its delicious! I'm so happy they expanded with more seating!"}
{"text":"Use to be great now is just overpriced average Arizona pizza and wings. The wings are now \"market price\" I thought that only existed in steakhouses and seafood restaurants. Just ordered from them on 10/12/14 and the order of wings was 9 total. I had to call and find out what the heck happened. Glad that Bella Pizza opened across the street better prices and no where near as long of a wait for an order."}
{"text":"Now I am only speaking about the fries and not any of the other items on the menu but seriously guys take the fries out from the menu because you have absolutely no clue how to do them.

They are greasy. They are lumpy. I think there's actually more grease then there is potato. And it taste like the grease is weeks old. Absolutely the worst fries in the world."}
{"text":"The measure of a pizza place is can you eat there everyday and not get tired? Thankfully the answer is yes if you are headed to venezias. They have decent lunch specials that make eating there affordable as well.

I will say that you can definitely think that there are distinct pizza chefs there, as the doughs and sauce ranges vary from day to day."}
{"text":"I'd give them 5 stars, buuuut... if you don't specifically ask for crispy pizza crust, then it comes out pretty soggy. It turned me off the 1st time. Decided to give them 2nd chance (asked to bake it a smidge longer for crispy crust) and it turned out fabulously!"}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza in town. Great location. I go there every Friday! Service is great and last time I went, the girl at the register, Mikayla, made my day!"}
{"text":"The pizza is really good here.  On the down side a hand dryer in the restroom instead of paper towels is not very hygienic. I hope they have paper towels for the guy making my pizza to wash his hands with."}
{"text":"Definitely not a NY style pizza. Not even close. Try Buonos much better. Have eaten here a few times with co-workers and all items are pretty crappy. Today I had the baked Ziti and the bread looked as if it was scorched by a flame thrower. Black and hard - GROSS. I will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"A little better than average, But pricy for a little pizza joint with nothing really special"}
{"text":"Our go-to for low carb pizza bowls. Everything is excellent, don't get me wrong, but these in particular offer a menu choice not available in most places."}
{"text":"YUM!

I just moved to Gilbert from Southern California, and can now cross finding a replacement for good italian take-out off my list.

I ordered 3 Spaghetti with marinara meals, and added meatballs to each for $1.50, a large garden salad, a 2 liter Pepsi, and a Passionfruit Iced Tea.

The Spaghetti was cooked Al Dente, and they put the sauce in a little cup on the side to keep the food from getting mushy on the ride home. The meatballs were perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. While eating, I was a enjoying it a little more than Meg Ryan in that iconic scene from When Harry met Sally.

The bread. OH GOD THE BREAD. If I had to eat one thing until I had a heart attack and died, I would want it to be that garlic bread.

The Passion Fruit Iced Tea was impeccably brewed and would get an A+.

They have earned my repeat business, I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great pizza for a killer price, 2 slices and a drink for only 5.32! So much good pizza for about what you would pay at slices if not less! If you go to McClintock High School or are in the area don't pass this up!"}
{"text":"Although the staff was friendly and helpful, the quality of the pizza was horrible. Cheese was not even cooked to the pizza dough properly and was loaded onto a double pepperoni when I specifically asked for no top cheese. I am well aware that pizza is greasy,  but the amount of grease from one slice of it alone was enough to soak up two napkins. I don't care how great of deals that they give out on their coupons, personally it is not worth it to me. Will not be going back here ever again. Much better pizza out there folks!!"}
{"text":"I remember back about a year ago this place was good. We used to order delivery all the time. Matter of fact, every party we had...we ordered a huge party pizza and it was so great and tatsy. Last 3 times we went in to the restraunt we got soggy pizza and greasy Italian fries.3rd times a charm. We won't be back"}
{"text":"I've had Venezia's a few times and have found it to be great. I'm impressed by what a great value it is. I have been in for lunch and ordered a large meal that included 2 giant slices with a soda for 6 dollars or so. The pizza is not the best I've ever had, but it is still pretty awesome and probably the best you can find like this for the price. I recommend it as an excellent place to grab a quick slice!"}
{"text":"great pizza! i love this place. i love that you can order pizza by the slice. whatever you order, know that it will be delicious. 

i just wish the location i go to wasn't next to the gym i go to. i'm gonna be honest...i've gone in there after a workout before. ha!  ;)"}
{"text":"Think Costco sized, individually sliced pizza times 2.  Excellent tasting and cheap along with a very friendly staff. Recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm parking this review under the Tempe location, but it's about the entire Venezia chain. It's about time a real New Yorker like me stood up and informed everyone in the valley that this is NOT what pizza is like in New York. I think any pizza that isn't Chicago deep dish is called \"New York Style\" in the valley and I will deal with Gus' Pizza falsely claiming to be NY Style in a separate review. Venezia's pizza does have a very pleasant sauce and good tasting ingredients, but let's face it...it is RUBBERY like Domino's Pizza, even if the ingredients are a notch up. A New Yorker never eats pizza at a chain restaurant and would NEVER put up with the size and price scheme that Venezia is running. Let it be known that what Venezia calls an XL (EXTRA LARGE) pie is slightly smaller in diameter than the normal standard size pizza in NYC.  Their so-called \"Large\" pie is an insult to consumers. That is what NYC pizzeria's call either a \"small pie,\" \"bar pie,\" or \"personal pie.\" I once asked for a little extra cup of sauce on the side and they wanted to charge me for it. That's the kind of utilitarian drain-every-nickel corporate chain attitude that you would NEVER see in a NYC pizzeria. Venezia's is NOT authentic Italian.

With everything I've just said, Venezia's is still probably the best pizza in the valley...THE TALLEST MIDGET IN THE ROOM in the valley of fake inauthentic overpriced ethnic food! (and by the way, it's been about 5 years since one esoteric episode of the TV show Breaking Bad used a Venezia's pizza box as a prop. With every year that passes, fewer people will remember it or care. Enough already! )"}
{"text":"They burn their gluten free pizzas every single time. the last time I ordered a Hawaiian pizza there was so much garlic that even if it hadn't  been burnt it still would not have been edible. It's unfortunate that I'll be buying my pizza elsewhere from now on. You'll see my previous review was similar and since then I've ordered several more pizzas and they continue to be bad enough that a single bad review isn't enough."}
{"text":"We were expecting a little more than quick serve, where you order then pick a seat. Food was ok, pizza is good."}
{"text":"In the past, I have always been a huge fan. My last dining experience left a lot to be desired. Since it was lunch, we decided to do the slices. We ordered a slice of pesto, slice of peperoni, slice of mushroom, and a slice of cheese. When the order was read back, I corrected the cashier, and thought she corrected. I will say that the eye roll when I said the order was incorrect was a bit much.

When the food came out, it was not corrected. My child will only eat cheese, so no cheese was an issue. The couter person did rush us a cheese slice for us, which was very much appreciated. I found the pesto to have a lot more oil/grease than usual. The peperoni was pretty much well done. Nothing tasted fresh...

The one redeaming item was that the antipasta salad was excellent. I have never had a bad salad from there.

I do love that they updated the dining room with more seating!"}
{"text":"Doing my up date second time went back order take out was much more happy with the taste of my pizza this time around! Did not taste commercial like or salty in anyway and was please with the ingredients of flavor. I will be back for number 3 Review because I'm a true believer what makes any restaurant or eatery is the consistency of there food."}
{"text":"Arguably one of the best NY style pizza here in the East Valley.  This place is always full, but never any real wait for a table.  TV's are always on, so expect that kind of atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great pizza, good wings, good calzone. Love this place!  They have other stuff besides pizza. I prefer this location over the Tempe one."}
{"text":"Just ordered two large pizzas and OMG my whole family is complaining how much it sucks.  I only ordered from here thinking it would be a step up from dominos, but NOOO.  Do not waste your money going here, Little Caesars is better and much cheaper.  The dough was soggy and it took over an hour to get here, not to mention that it was cold by the time it arrived.  STAY AWAY!!! I will never order here again, what a waste of 35 dollars."}
{"text":"Pizzas here are second to none. Toppings are quality and heavy and freaking dee-lish. Just tried my first calzone from here and am pretty disappointed. I'm comparing it to the calzone I had at Buono's Pizza (Guadalupe and Dobson) which had ricotta cheese and was addictingly good. This calzone was filled primarily with a chewy cheese you'd normally find on top of a pizza and nothing else. 

So to recap:

Pizza - amazing
Service - fantastic
Wait time - not bad at all
Calzone - meh"}
{"text":"5 for pies, 3 for slices.

Slices are pretty hit or miss - sometimes they pop out stale, with the toppings obviously thrown on last minute, and sometimes they come out lovingly crafted by the Hephaistos of pizza in the fires of delicious.

If you order a pie, then you're guaranteed freshness."}
{"text":"I've been a long time customer of Venezia's, but their customer service is seriously declining.  The last time I ordered, the pizza arrived 50 minutes late and COLD.  Yes, that's 50 minutes BEYOND the promised delivery time, which was 70 minutes from the time it was ordered.  For the mathematically challenged, it took Venezia's a whopping 2 hours from the time of order to deliver 2 cold pizzas.  I called and spoke to the manager, who said he would void the charge to my credit card.  That didn't happen.  It's been a week and the charge posted in full to my credit card.  It's one thing to mess up.  It's another thing completely to mess up and then lie to your customers about it."}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza. 45 minute delivery time on a Friday night that they kept to. Don't order a salad expecting \"mixed greens\", its romaine."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Friendly employees and fair prices. We would come here again!"}
{"text":"Delivered by Anthony in a super timely fashion I must say! We ordered a small pepperoni pie and a large Cesar salad! Had the pie cooked well done and double cut. Gotta have that crispy crust!!! The salad was actually very good size and the dressing was good. Shaved parm and a hefty amount of croutons. Our delivery driver, Anthony, was very happy and had a smile on his face when we opened up the heated carrier. Friendly and warm he also sprinted back to his car to get the shredded parm and hot peppers. Good dude!!! Will order again soon"}
{"text":"Always great pizza and wings.  Best green olive pizza around.  Wings are good and my wife loves the greek salad."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and wings. Some of the best pizza we've ever had! The perfect New York style thin crust. Nice sized wings. Can order wings, thighs or 50/50. Ordered and paid through the Yelp app. Took about 40 minutes for our order to arrive. Love that it gave us a stopwatch to see how long it had been since we ordered. Made the wait seem shorter. Food was well worth waiting 40 minutes!! Great value for the price!! Awesome experience!! Can't wait to visit again on our next trip to the Phoenix area!!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to Chandler from Tucson and happen to be very close to Venezia's.  Our first couple nights in the new house were hectic and we hadn't unpacked any of our kitchen stuff, so we were looking for something that could be delivered.

Venezia's was the first thing that came up on my Iphone Yelp app so we gave it a try.  Nothing exciting, just your standard pepperoni pizza.  The price was good, and even better, the pizza was quite good.

The next night we tried some of their winds and other items and were equally happy with them.

Venezia's will be our \"go to\" pizza place here at the new house, which is saying something, we never had that in Tucson."}
{"text":"What a great local spot in Mesa. I didn't even know this place existed until I yelped on the way home from the parents. It lives up to its rating for sure. The slices are ready quick, salads plentiful and really does take you away from the Mesa suburbs for a quick moment. Great interior design that gives you that New York feel. Tables and decor are clean, and the food is great."}
{"text":"Venezia's is my favorite pizza joint in AZ!  

I'm deducting 1 star for the service. I know this place is popular, but I feel like the service could be a little quicker. The slices are awesome, though. 

I'm a Midwest kid, so I'll probably never understand what makes \"authentic\" New York pizza so special, but all of my NY friends love Venezia's, so they're obviously doing something right.

Feeling brave? Grab a buddy, and tackle the 24 inch party pie. You'll get your picture on the wall!"}
{"text":"We order form this place regularly, and I love it! Good sauce, very cheesy, plenty of quality toppings, and the price is pretty darn good. They deliver fast, and it's always hot, but I think the delivery charge is a little high, so we usually pick the pizza up. They are the pizza Walter White threw on the roof of his house, being a Breaking Bad fan, this makes me like this place even more."}
{"text":"I thought it was ok.  we ordered a x large pepperoni to go, I'll probably try something else next time,"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Like that they slice specials. The honey hot wings are awesome!"}
{"text":"Favorite casual pizza place! I always get the pesto chicken slice and a Greek salad. The pizza is great if you like the New York style where it's thin but not so crispy that it doesn't flop down. Salads are fresh, I've had the wings as well and they're okay but you definitely come here for the pizza. Never had a bad experience at Venezia's and I've been to the Chandler and Tempe locations as well."}
{"text":"Always so delicious! Love the lunch specials and the ranch dressing is amazing! Closest pizza to nyc style in the east Valley."}
{"text":"Ok, I finally tried a sandwich here.  My advice? Stick with the pizza.  Its not that my Italian beef sandwich was bad, it just wasn't that good.  Their pizza is not only better, but cheaper! So mystery solved.  I'm going back to pizza."}
{"text":"I think I like this location better than the one in Gilbert.  First off, its closer to my current location (used to live in Chandler but moved).  Secondly, they have a better drink selection.  I'm not stuck drinking disgusting diet Pepsi and I am so happy! They have diet Dr Pepper! They still have diet Pepsi, but I don't have to drink it! Yay choices!  Pizza is the same.  I thought my slice was smaller than what I'm used to, but since I don't have a side-by-side comparison...well, can't really be sure.  It wasn't enough of a difference to really matter, just something I noticed because I'm watching portion sizes.  And yes, dieting sucks.  All in all, I enjoyed my lunch.  Cheap, fast, and delicious-- what's not to like?"}
{"text":"I love their pizza. This is the first time I tried their pizza and I ordered their large mushroom and sausage and chicken wings and it was very good. I moved here from Cali to AZ and I tried Barros pizza and I thought their pizza was very good, but this pizzeria was even better, so I know where to order really good pizza. I had it delivered and they delivered by a timely manner. They also found my apartment which is pretty hard to find. So I would order pizza from this place in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Love the food it so delicious but trying to pick your food up if it's a carry out is a nightmare. When you call in an order for pickup and they say a hour and a half is not cool. They need a better system or open more restaurants. They have great food but ok service. I called my order in at 615 and I'm here waiting at 0748 and it's still not ready."}
{"text":"I have a pizza problem...at least for this place. We order delivery once a week. Not a huge fan of the delivery charge or hour delivery time but once the pizza shows up all that goes out the window. Good sauce, crust and fresh toppings. My personal favorite is black olives, mushrooms and pepperoni."}
{"text":"I ordered my food just before closing so I'm not sure if some of my order had to do with this, being that I may have gotten some food that was old but here goes.

I ordered honey BBQ wings, Fries, And A sub. 

The honey BBQ wings was like chewing on Honey BBQ Chicken Jerky. Flavor was great but it was so old or overcooked. I did order at end of day so I'm not sure what that's about.

The sub was good. I liked it, but the Au Ju sauce was the saltiest thing I've ever tasted besides my sisters cooking.

The fries seemed old and were sticking to each other and were not good. I gave it a try though and ate a small portion to test them out. I ended up throwing them away.

The extra bleu cheese I ordered was Amazing! Chunks and great consistency. Was very impressed. 

All in all i would try this place again but maybe when I'm not getting the end of the days left over food. 

I give two stars for the fries, Au Ju sauce and the wings."}
{"text":"My gf is suffering through \"shark week\" and wanted pizza. I did take out and the pizza was ready when I got there letting me hurry home to the sea of hormones my bedroom was becoming. The pizza was shaped like the circle on a pentagram but still helped me keep the possibility of needing to perform an exorcism at bay. She was happy and sated, another night I keep all body parts and have a warm bed to sleep in."}
{"text":"Good quality New York style pizza, which is hard to find in this state.

They have a huge party size pizza that is great for a lot of people."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite pizza place in town. The food is delicious. I have yet to find something on the menu that didn't surpass my expectations."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I've been to two of them (Paradise Valley area and Gilbert). Both have been incredible, each time I've been.  Tonight I ordered a protein bowl w pepperoni, tomatoes, basil, and artichoke hearts.  I also ordered wings, well done w the sweet chili sauce on the side.  The food arrived even faster than promised (delivery), it was still very hot and the chicken crispy!  The bowl was full of delicious ingredients, not just a bunch of sauce like I've had in other places.  The girl who delivered my food was very friendly; overall a very good place to get some pizza, wings, and other delicious Italian style food!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great, we really like the pizza here. Justin delivers the pizza hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"This place really isn't bad. I have had a lot worse. It's not really NY pizza in my opinion. The crust is chewy not thin and crispy. It's not my favorite but I don't mind the pizza. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there but it's good take out. I'll never understand how a pizza place has Pepsi instead of coke. I think it's an AZ thing. All the decent pizza joints serve Pepsi. If you go to NYC they all have coke. They even run ads on tv about it. Solution is take it Togo. They do a great job on take out they even have a separate like for takeout. Then you can drink a coke with it. But I guess cause it's really Arizona style pizza it's supposed to go with a Pepsi."}
{"text":"So me and my husband went here for lunch the other day. First my salad came out and it was gross thought it couldn't get worse then my wings were under cooked when I asked for them to be cooked extra crispy. Then my pizza was cold and my husbands food was still doughy. We will never go back but I gave them do stars because I was clean."}
{"text":"picked up my order. staff was friendly (Cloie), the order was ready when they said it would be done. The wings were tasty but a little small. The pizza was good but not NY."}
{"text":"Love isn't the word, it's more like an obsession! I've upgraded from slice specials to party pizzas! The customer service is always as good as the pizza (but the pizza is definitely better). I recommend Venezia's to everyone, also their GF pizza is one of the best I've had! 

The tempe location is the best for dining in as well. More than enough TVs for sports no matter the season! 

Although they are always well staffed, I recommend calling ahead of time to place your order so your wait time isn't long! 

Do not forget the ranch!!!!! Their \"made-in-house\" buttermilk ranch is simply the topping on the pie! But the bottle is you're a ranch lover (you'll thank me later)"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Venezia's years ago when I started working at a new job in Tempe. It was the team's every-Friday lunch destination and it was kind of a big deal *every* Friday.

Having grown up in New Jersey, I was skeptical at first. I've yet to find a pizzeria that truly matches the \"New York style\" they claim to live up to, and I've been looking!

The minute I walked through the front door, I knew that Venezia's was going to get me very close to that holy grail I'd been searching for.

They had pizza-by-the-slice, the slices were obnoxiously large, thin-crusted, and soggy with grease. This was about all I needed to see. The first bite confirmed my hopes.

Venezia's has been my #1 go-to for pizza ever since. Unfortunately, there must be something wrong with my body, because I feel sick after eating here *every* time.

**To put the quality of Venezia's pizza into perspective for you, though, I make the conscious decision to order here even *knowing* that it will make me feel unwell!

Any other business would lose a star for \"making me feel sick afterward\", but not Venezia's. I don't blame them, and it doesn't stop me from eating here.

If you haven't been, GO! It's the closest you'll get to an authentic NY-style pizza this far south and west. Careful, though - portions are much larger than you might expect!  ;)"}
{"text":"After several poor experiences we decided to give it one last shot after talking to Domenick. Our last take out order was perfect & my son enjoyed his cheesecake with strawberry glaze this time! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza spot! I would come here 2-3 a week when I was pregnant. So yummy!!! Big single slices! The wings are eh, okay. But the Pizza is AMAZINGGGG!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Philly sandwich, I had on Thursday. It was out of this world good. Fresh and tasty.
I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"good pizza good price definitely try it once if you're binge watching breaking bad or a fan of the show.

I won't say it's the best new york pizza or a true new york pizza experience, but for the price it's a pleasant alternative to one of those bigger pizza chains. Many coupons can be found online so I do recommend looking those up before ordering."}
{"text":"So...like most of the world I watched Breaking Bad and was geeking out a bit when I heard that this was the restaurant chain that provided Walt's infamous \"roof\" pizza. Haven't watched Breaking Bad? Go watch it, I'll wait. Okay, but seriously, the pizza at Venezia's is delicious! Their crust (what pizza is almost all about) is just the right balance of crispy and chewy and their toppings are fresh and generous. My all time favorite pie is the Park Avenue, sub the tomatoes with bacon for that extra flavor! The inside of this location is clean and has a good amount of seating. If there were any room for improvement it might be in speed and staff training. This is one of our go-to fast meal spots, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of this place for years.  The pizza is the BEST in Arizona.  I'm sure some flakes from california won't think so, they like their california pizza kitchen crap.

If you like NY style pizza, this is a taste of home.  My wife and I practically lived here.  Heck, I became friends with the owner I was there so much.  He really cares about his customers and making a quality product.

The party pizza is 2 1/2 feet wide, it will feed 4 hungry college students.  Make sure you ask what the daily special is.  The lunch specials are great as well, 2 HUGE slices and a soda for about $5.

They use Boar's Head Cold Cuts, which are THE best you can use.  No cheap crap here.  Get the Italian sub with Greek dressing (instead of Italian).  It is INCREDIBLE!"}
{"text":"If you like NY style pizza, this is is the best place for a thin crust in the southeast valley, my second time at this location, I usually a regular at the Tempe location. Honey Bbq wings are the bomb, plus there ranch dressing is yummy!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  From the service to the food, you won't be disappointed!  The prices are perfectly affordable!  Great for anyone on a college budget or static income.

The pizzas range traditional to unique, and so do their sizes!  I am impressed how they taste good - even the next day (just reheat in your oven until the cheese crisps slightly).

Their specials and deals are phenomenal. And they've won some awards for the best sandwich - or something like that.  That's right, they provide sandwiches and salads too!  I've had their salads.  I think it was the Greek salad. I was satisfied.

I don't have any serious complaints.  It 's clean enough, including the bathrooms.  And they are charitable too! They have raised money for Childhelp, a nonprofit that aids in the prevention and treatment of abused and neglected children.

I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars to leave room for them to do something that completely takes me by surprise. And then I can write an updated review to reflect that. :)  What would that \"surprise\" be?  Oh I don't know.  If I knew, it wouldn't be a surprise.  So..."}
{"text":"Great Pizza spot, we ordered spicy chicken pizza, cheesy breadsticks and some wings. Everything was delicious. Friendly and fast service and very affordable. Will be definitely going back."}
{"text":"I ordered Four 24\" square cut cheese pizzas to be delivered to the park for my daughter's birthday recently. The driver was on time and courteous. We were off to a great start. 

After the driver left we opened the boxes to check the goods and start serving when we noticed the pizzas were smashed up and folded over onto each other, and the pieces were all separated. This is how each box looked; as if the driver hit a few bumps in the road and smashed the brakes a few times on the way over. The kids were getting hungry and it was time to serve lunch. 

Immediately I rang up the Mill and Southern store  where I had placed the order and spoke to the manager. He offered to remake the pies and send them over in about 20 minutes but I said I would prefer a refund, and that is exactly what he did for me. That was a relief. 

Quick-acting customer service like that will have me ordering from Venezia's more often. It's been a couple days since the party and I'm still working on polishing off the leftover pizza!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get pizza from. All the locations do a great job and the food is top notch. Not only is the pizza and bone inwings great but they have a antipasto salad that is truly one of the best salads you will ever try. I'm a meat and potatoes guy but I almost want that salad as much as the dang pizza!"}
{"text":"Ordered this pizza to my house and it was very delicious.  I also got the ceasar salad and was very pleased to see it came with a side of chicken. Also very tasty.  Pizza was a good size and a great price for everything we ordered. Definitely not the first or last time eating from this location!"}
{"text":"Much pizza. Such delicious. 

I think Venezia's is my favorite pizza. It's so good it makes me angry enough to want to throw a pizza on my roof. But I wouldn't want to waste it, now would I.  It's just great pizza- no foofoo crusts or organic craze toppings, just good, original delicious pizza. It's thin but not too thin, with perfect crust. Quality tasting toppings as well. 

Wings are pretty good but sometimes sauce can be lacking. They went through a phase where they forgot my extra ranch like three times in a row (just one won't do!), but that was a couple of years ago and have been better recently. I like the getting a mix of their medium and gold sauce, and dipping pizza in it.

I'll continue to order from them. I wish they still had byob, because I never got to participate in it. The one time I was going to, they had changed locations and rules. Bummer."}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING! Only thing that wasn't that great were the wings. Definitely some awesome pizza!"}
{"text":"We have been eating their pizza for years.  We love their pizza and highly recommend them. :)"}
{"text":"The closest I've gotten to New York style pizza since I moved to Phoenix 5 years ago. Recommended by a coworker who is not from New York. I couldn't stop thanking her for the pick. The dough was just the right amount of chewiness, and the sauce had that nice zing with the right amount of flavor. I look forward to another visit."}
{"text":"I office just down the street from Venezias, so I 
go during lunch. Whether I call 
/online in my order or sit in the restaurant they've always done a great job. Food and service is great and fast. I recently discovered their Pizza bowls, and now have to explain the new love in my life to my wife. I hope she understands.  If you love cheesy goodness try their pizza bowls, and thank me later."}
{"text":"We love their Pizza. They're always fast to get our food out even with a big group. Good TV coverage, We've come here a few times to watch games."}
{"text":"Anytime I need pizza, I go here. All the other pizza places seem to have inflated ratings. Venezia's is the best around and the rest are jokes."}
{"text":"Used to live in AZ and this was my favorite pizza in the metro area. Still the best pizza I've had in the Western USA. I stop in every time I visit AZ and WISH there was at one in the SF Bay Area (franchise opportunity????)"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place but I feel like every time I go it's more expensive! The food quality is good, don't get me wrong, but not for the price and service. We went in recently and got 2 slices of pizza, a drink and 15 wings and it was 30 dollars! Pretty steep in my opinion. The employees are ALWAYS rude like they're so annoyed to be at work. Never smile, never make recommendations, and answer questions like you are such a bother. With so many other pizza options locally, it's not hard to put this place as a last resort option these days."}
{"text":"This pizza is just OK, the crust is too chewey (i hope that is spelled right). The toppings are good and the flavor is average, however it is very greasy. I would say this place is just as good as any Domino's pizza chain. But I have been spoiled with east coast pizza in NYC, Philly and Jersey. It will do for a cheap place to get a lot of pizza for a party."}
{"text":"Good thing is pizzas are huge, but to us no flavor. We have been here before but today it was so hot in the building (which they said was as low as ac could go), everyone sitting in dining was commenting and complaining. I thought i started menopause, the heat in the building was miserable we ended up asking for boxes to go and ate at home.  :( don't think our family will be back."}
{"text":"I just moved to the Mesa area and was super excited to find out that Venezias is so close! I am a fan of pizza in general, but this place really knocks it out of the park. The crust is phenomenal and the toppings are fresh. They have lots of coupons available and that is how I get the best deals, so make sure you look online and in the mail. 

Recommendations: 
- Vegetarian Style (Mushrooms, green peppers, onions, black olives and tomatoes.)
- Margherita pizza (Mozzarella, fresh basil and sauce.)  
- Pepperoni and Olive (Good old stand-by! Their pepperoni's rock!)

If you are looking for a lighter side: 
- Garden Salad & Antipasto Salad are my two fav's. 

Must order sides: 
- Garlic Bread with cheese (Sometimes I just get this and a side garden salad, YUM!)

**FYI: There is a 10\" Gluten Free option as well which is awesome!**

I have always received great service at this location, the food is always delicious and the prices are very reasonable (with coupons.) I normally go into the store and pick it up myself or eat there, I have yet to order delivery since I live close and like saving the buck to grab it up myself."}
{"text":"They have the best lunch combos and I've never had a bad experience with them. The workers are always friendly and quick to get you your food. Amazing pizza and I love their ranch!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is very well made and is tasty. I have tried the margherita with my choice of toppings. 

Staff was friendly and helpful in helping me choose when I went there the first time.

Definitely a go to place if you are looking for something a little late in the evening in this area."}
{"text":"I stopped by here after my work out at the gym next door.  I got a garden salad with out tomatoes and banana peppers.  I love the parmesan peppercorn dressing they have there.  The salad was good and tasty because of the dressing.  I did get a side of meatballs and they were good.  I wish they were a little warmer though.  This place does have good pizza, but I am avoiding pizza for the time being."}
{"text":"In my earlier review I said the sauce and cheese stopped far short of the edge of the pizza so that a 16 inch pie was effectively much smaller. But I also said the pizza itself was quite good and that I'd go back again.  Domenick, the owner, said my description was not the way their pizza should be made and that he would speak to his chefs to make sure it didn't happen. Both he and Chad, a manager, invited me to return and give them another try.  
       Well, tonite my wife and I returned to this restaurant and ordered another extra large pizza, this time with crumbled sausage.What a delightful meal. The sauce and cheese were spread generously over the dough, reaching near to the edge. The crumbled sausage was, likewise generously applied over the entire pie. And, just as I said on my earlier review, the pizza was quite good. In fact, it was excellent. Now remember, this is New York style pizza. What you don't know is I'm a New York boy, born and raised in Brooklyn.  Fuggedaboudit!!  I know good pizza, and this is very, very good pizza. Five stars! Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't know what the few negative reviews were about, but this pizza was delicious.  Perfect crust, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and not too thick.  Heaping amounts of meat on the meat lovers pizza.  Good quality stuff.  The supreme pizza was full of yummy goodness.  Fresh ingredients packed with flavor.  

The customer service was great.  The place had a friendly, neighborly atmosphere.

Try the Greek salad.  Now that's a zesty zing of Greek goodness.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza and took 1 hour and 30 min for my food to arrive. The driver was rude when he brought the order to the door. The pizza was cold.  I will never order pizza here again this was a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Awesome huge pizza! If you need to feed a large family or you are a big eater, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I've ordered take out from this place a couple of times. Mainly I just stick to their pizzas, which are pretty good. However the other night I was craving some wings and decided to try theirs. It was a huge disappointment. The sauce was very flavor full, but the wings were lacking. In fact, it was like they gave me just the bones. So sadly, I would recommenced staying away from the wings. 
I do like their pizza. Its tasty and they have some interesting ideas. I had the Greek Salad pizza which was pretty good. 

The pizza is worth getting, but not sure about the wings or other items (I haven't tried anything else). I do like how they have online ordering which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza spots. Their fried zucchini with ranch dressing is so yummy, I crave it all the time. My favorite pizza is the pesto with chicken, but I've tried a bunch of their toppings and they are all great. Ask for your pizza well done if you like crispy crispy crust.  Their antipasto salad is great, too!"}
{"text":"This pizza is very tasty and they have really good salad and wings too! The hot wings are hot. Ranch is good too! Its NY style pizza and delicious."}
{"text":"I love pizza. Period. Cheese sauce and bread. Holy g, in an oven with awesome toppings, who came up with this amazing meal and why aren't they beatified if not a saint. Come on Roma, get on that, we need to know that Italian!

But seriously, Ive been to pizza places all over the country and this is my favorite type - big New York style slices, pipping hot, not too greasy and loaded with a delicious not too sweet sauce. Venezia's is my favorite pizza place in this style in Arizona. Ive been to Pizzeria Bianco and having had to wait the 2 or 3 hours to be seated til I was so hammered from being at Bar Bianco next door I couldnt remember what I ate or how it tasted from being so hungry, I can easily say, Venezia's is where you should go if you want a great filling slice of pizza in the Valley. They also catered an event I promoted with several of their party pizzas and they were delicious. They always have courteous quick servers and I even enjoy their fountain drinks. Not to mention, they always have great specials if you follow them on Twitter. On Tuesdays, you can get a huge slice of pizza and a large drink for under 2 dollars. I cant say enough good things about this place, check them out, theyre amazing."}
{"text":"Good pizza for a great price. Best pizza in Tempe for the price and not having to sit down to be waited on. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"2 words gold medium sauce. This stuff is so good I wish it came out of the soda dispensers. Keep up the good work venezias I Eat there quite a bit"}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying I have been to NYC many times. This is not \"New York style\" pizza IMO.

We ordered spaghetti and meatballs which was mediocre at best, cheeses sticks that were average,  and a large pizza that was OK. 

If you really are looking for NY style pizza....Casanova Brothers pizza is fantastic and is the closest I've found in this area so far."}
{"text":"While we absolutely love their food, their attention to detail in completing orders is terrible. For the past year we have had to repeatedly go back to there to get something that they failed to include in our order- an extra side of dressing, the sauce for the kids pasta, etc. We've talked to the manager before, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. Like I said, we love their food, but they need to train their staff to stop hanging out and gossiping and check their orders before they go out!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!  Owner is great and often remembers us!!  Love the pizza, knots and the desserts are amazing too!!"}
{"text":"Love their chicken wings!! I've had a variety of flavors for wings from this place and they are all sooo good!! Their pizza is really good as well. I never get tired of this place when I'm traveling to Tempe."}
{"text":"Using a coupon that came in the mail, I found some great pricing on pizza.  So, we stopped in for the first time and have a really great impression of this restaurant.  One of the best things, is the pizza was not too salty - tasted like I used to get on the street corners in Italy - thin crust, just the right about of sauce, and slightly crispy on the bottom.  Also, the pizza came out really fast, despite the place being very crowded on a Saturday night!  The place is not stingy on ingredient quantity, too.  Next time I will likely only put one ingredient per pizza instead of two ingredients.  One caveat - the parking lot is poorly lighted and there are some weird curbs that are not reflectively painted and you could easily run into them.   Overall, not a great parking lot design."}
{"text":"This is why I love the yelp app for my phone. I can find good places to eat and bookmark them for later. Venezias was one of those bookmarks and today was finally the day. Let me just say that the reviews were spot on. Me and the wifey loved the pizza and wings and the new redone interior is very nice and spacious. The pizza is on the doughy side which I love but for those who like more of the cracker thin pizza be warned. The wings were good as well and I will certainly be back for NFL Sundays to feed my guests. Thanks to my boy Andy B. For the tip!"}
{"text":"Oh yess this pizza was great! Stopped in around 9pm and this place was still pretty busy! We were a party of 6 so we ordered two x large pizzas, twenty four wings, a salad, four drinks, and two beers. The food took about 20 minutes to come out but definitely worth it because everything tasted amazing!

Our bill came out to be about $95 but very reasonable for all the food that we received. Everything tasted fresh, the pizza was hot, the cheese gooey, and the toppings gave it that extra flavor of yummy goodness. There are also more then plenty of tvs playing around you as you eat. 


*the bathrooms were pretty dirty, and the floors were even worse. I almost slipped, wah. 

All in all I'd come back again. The pizza was DELISH. I just wouldn't use the bathroom :o"}
{"text":"This will be the last time I order from them.   The pizza and wings are awesome,  however they never deliver them on time.  There is always something missing from the order a well.   Tonight we oredered our usual order at 5:45 to be delivered at 7pm.  The guy got to our house at 7:20.  He had several hot bags of food and none of the orders were together,  so it took a free minutes for him to dig through the bags to find our food.  When we finally got our food out was missing some items.   He said he wasn't sure how that happened since he checked out all off, really?! Finally once we sat down to eat the food was luke warm but by that time we were tired and just wanted to eat.  Hopefully this doesn't happen to anyone else."}
{"text":"I  tried their Roast Beef Sub today and found the 'geniune' Boar's Head beef to smell, taste bad, dry, overcooked and was green in many spots.  It was served on at least a half a loaf of bread and little else.  The mayo was actually watered down (how cheap is that).  I purchase Boar's Head meats from my deli and never had anything that looked like I was served.  It was just nasty.....I threw it away because the bread absorbed the smell of the 'roast beef'.  Unless you have no fear of eating what may be diseased meat, be my guest at one of the worst places I have EVER eaten.  Those that have rated this place anything more than one star are obviously without taste (buds or otherwise)."}
{"text":"It doesn't get better at Venezia's. Pizza dough is moist, the cheese/sauce ratio is correct and you get a decent (not healthy) lunch for under 5 bucks. Also, their pesto pizza is a the bomb!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in a long time.  The employees are so courteous and helpful.  Thisc place needs to be commended on their service and food."}
{"text":"Based on the pizza alone, Venezia's would get 2.5 stars. It's just not as good as the other pizza joints that I've given 3 stars. However, they got our pie to us quickly on a busy Friday night, and it was cheaper than Papa John's. Unfortunately, it tasted just like Papa John's. When I asked my husband how he liked his slice, he quipped, \"All that's missing is the garlic dipping sauce.\"

Venezia's seems like a top choice for many people in the surrounding neighborhood and most of Gilbert PD. As for me, I'm going to keep trying to find my favorite local pizza place."}
{"text":"I've had pizza in every major city in the USA and this is hands down, THE BEST, anywhere!"}
{"text":"Venezia's is a tried and true pizza joint! Always consistent, always delicious. I haven't had a pizza I don't like- perfect combo of doughy, chewy/ crispy! I love their margarita pizza-- fresh basil, mozzarella and tomato!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in simply because I heard from a friend that goes to the gym next door to this place, that it was great pizza & wings so, I decided to try it today. Now I don't wanna be her friend anymore because I see she's a lie! Everything was gross! The pizza was old, & dry, & it seemed like wings were microwaved, how soggy they were....I can say the employees were very kind & service was fast tho! #FAIL"}
{"text":"1st I have to say who ever controlled the music is a awesome person. 
Came in on Thursday March 23rd. 4 adults & 8 kids. 
The staff had great customer service from the register to the young lady who kept checking to see if everything was ok.
The chicken pesto pizza was delicious and I will return for this. I also had a slice of the buffalo chicken, it was spicy but lacked flavor. The kids loved the pepperoni pizza & fries.... But the music was awesome every song was a hit."}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if I possible. Horrible customer service. Phone clerk (Cesar) was a a$$. Pizza showed up half order and manager (Nick) didn't give one care. Pizza is good but will pay for Barros instead!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab some slices for lunch or to get a whole pizza for whatever. 
The toppings are great, perfect amount of sauce, and always extra cheesy. 
They have great specials for slices and the rest of their menu. 
Good choice for a casual pizza place in Tempe."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites.  Delicious pizzas that won't break the bank.  Actually everything I have tried here is good.  This place never disappoints.  AND...it was the pizza on Breaking Bad!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Nice and roomy for large crowds! Servers are extremely nice and patient with someone as indecisive as me! Honey BBQ wings are pretty good but maybe a little on the salty side. However, the cheese pizza is Delish!"}
{"text":"So good.  Pies are great, wings amazing.  Even delivery was fantastic!  Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"My go to for delivery. Excellent pizza, reminds me of the New York style I grew up on. Love the fried zucchini and the great antipasto salad too! Quick delivery and the price is right for authentic New York style pizza."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the pizza here!! It's so awesome and delicious!! The only thing keeping me from giving the 5 star is that I think I'm right at the edge of their delivery area. Everytime I get my pizza it's started to get cold or is just warm. I don't know if it's due to me possibly being on the edge of their delivery area or if it's not kept warm during delivery. Even with that factor this is still my favorite pizza place and my go to. Would be nice to get it hot once that's for sure but in this case it's not a deal breaker for me because of how good it is."}
{"text":"So far, I've had the pizza, wings, meatball sub, and antipasto salad and a high recommendation for all of them.  Love the antipasto!  Wings are pretty good for a pizza place and the sub was quite yummy.  Pizza is perfect classic pizza.  Delivery, pickup, or dine-in- I've done all three.  Oh yeah, and their chocolate cannoli are AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Perfect pizza , perfect people ! Joel I think his name is assisted me perfectly his team was amazing and everything was really clean, they made sure my order was correct and brought back the best pizza I've had in a while ! 5/5 stars recommend!"}
{"text":"We get the party pizza, it's a great value and the kids get a kick out of it. friendly delivery drivers and prompt service for cooking a pizza and delivering it."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but overpriced for the take out portions. We ordered several pasta dishes and the lasagna portion was very small for the price. My wife got spaghetti and again very small. Get rid of the small tin dish and they've got it made. Manager did take our call and seemed to care. Even credited a little to our account/phone number. Manager gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"Fresh sauce and ingredients. We had the everything pizza and our only complaint was that it had was too much cheese . Good service and pie."}
{"text":"We went off Yelp reviews. They was rated well so we gave it a try. The price was good and the food was also. We were well attended to. We told them this was our first visit and they treated us well."}
{"text":"This has to be our favorite Sunday stop! Only restaurant that my whole family agrees on together!! My picky eating son loves this place and always his suggestion to eat! We live the pizza but you have to try the sandwiches cold or hot! Wow!! And the girls there are always so helpful and sweet as can be!! And if they make any mistakes they go out of their way to make sure your happy!! 
My family will be a forever fan of this restaurant! Thank you for your awesome care and love!! We are huge fans and will continue having Venezias on Sundays!!"}
{"text":"Fan-tasty-tic! Loved the pizza slice. Heck the slice is as large as an actual pizza. 
Full of flavour and so many options to choose from! I couldn't stop at one (even though I should've). So had a pesto chicken slice and a sausage slice. Both were equally good and piping hot! 
I'm hooked and will be back!"}
{"text":"My order was over an hour late. The manger did not apologize. He actually confused my name with Nathan instead of megan and was perfectly content with me never receiving my pizza. I won't order here again."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like pizza, but a co-worker talked me into coming here. Made it here around lunch time, and it seemed super busy so I assumed it must be good and  worth the trip. The Venezia's Supreme and 6 spicy wings (that made me tear like a little girl) w/drink combo is a very good deal for around $6.. very authentic NY style pizza. Good dough and ingredients. Thank you for the big slices of pizza, I'm tired of going to places and over-paying for dinkey little slices.

Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Extremely overrated! I read all these reviews hoping to experience a slice of heaven and I can already tell you that Jimmy and Joe's, and Rays pizza is by far better.

The crust had no flavor and it was a little too thick for thin crust. The crust had too much yeast and you got full after too slices because of all the air in the crust thanks to the yeast overdose.  The crust was also very dry and a bit hard. The toppings were good particularly the sausage.  

The cheese gave it away as a phony.  The way you distinguish between a real NY style pizza and a fake one (like this one) is through the cheese. Real places make their own mozzarella or acquire the real thing.  Real mozzarrella should have an almost a rubbery consistency with a very salty aftertaste. If it tastes smooth and melts too evenly, it's not the real thing. I'm not saying it should clump but it should taste natural and this mozzarrela was not legit. In fact, it had no flavor The sauce lacked any zip to it. It was very plain and non acidic. 

The bottomline is this place is hype. It has a great sounding name. The menu offers plenty of options to make this place sound good and it's pictures and website are nice but the pizza is average. I would not come back here"}
{"text":"Love this pizza and wings place! It's just down the street from my house and took us two years to try it, and now we're converts. The pizza is traditional New York style and always delicious. The wings are perfectly crisp and the sauce choice are great. The sweet chili is my favorite."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here while we were visiting. It was pretty good. The sauce was a bit sweet for my liking and the crust a little chewy, but I would still suggest trying this place out. The ingredients tasted fresh and the employees were friendly."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza in the area. Always have deals and coupons. Love this place!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place to eat in Arizona. Its always fun to meet with my friends and family knowing the food and the atmosphere will be the same."}
{"text":"I'm not a college student so I'm not basing my rating on whether it's cheap or the type of deals I can score. If you are looking for that review, stop reading. If you are someone like me who is over the age of 25 and is interested in finding a great pizzeria and craves NY style pizza then this review is for you.

The pizza is good but disappointing. There are better NY style pizzerias in the valley....much better... Rays, Gus', Jimmy and Joe's Pizza. The pizza has a lot of yeast so you feel full after two slices.  The yeast also takes away from the flavor.  The cheese lacks flavor and tastes as if there is little salt in it. The meat toppings such as their Italian sausage is small and has little flavor. They advertise as if they are an authentic Sicilian style pizzeria but it honestly tastes like imitation NY style pizza. 

I would strongly suggest not ordering their 12 inch pizzas. They won't feed 2 people and are basically slightly larger than a personal pizza.  Go with the 16 inch.  About the pizzeria itself....Yes, you can eat there but this joint should be viewed as a carry-out only place. The only people eating there are teenagers or college students who are grabbing a bite to eat before they go out or after they come back from the bars. So unless you fit into one of those two demographics, get the pizza to go."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! The slice specials are a good price. The wings are good. The large pies can get expensive but I have no compliants about taste."}
{"text":"We've only tried the Pizza Bianco, regular pepperoni pizza and wings, but so far... they are really good. We ordered from them several times. Wings could be cooked a little longer as I like my wings just a little more crispy and NOT having all that chicken fat slim. We tried the XXL pizza for a party and well that was just doughy... I like that I can order all drum sticks for the wings and love the bbq/spicy mix. Try them, I think you'll be a fan too."}
{"text":"Just ordered a large pepperoni & large supreme & hot wings. Wings had great flavor and were okay, however a couple were not cooked all the way. The pizza was absolutely disgusting!!! I mean bad. First the pep lacked all flavor and can be compared to eating a thin limp piece of cardboard, to make things better the supreme was completely soggy, the dough was undercooked, and to try and cover it, they slapped another piece of cooked and sauced dough under it! I mean yuck!!! That was my first and last experience with this place. I can get better quality from a hot n ready for $5 bucks than I can here. Nuff said!!"}
{"text":"This place is all around great! Great food, great prices, huge portions, and good service! You can't beat their slice, 6 wings, and a drink combo! I have yet to try the challenge they have but if you have a huge appetite it's worth a shot!"}
{"text":"Love love love Venezia's!! The slices when you eat there are the best. Huge pieces of thin crust pizza! Not expensive and a very chill environment. They can get very busy at night and on weekends but it never seems to take too long."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from this location many times and it is hands down my favorite pizza place. The pizzas are amazing the the prices are fair. Whenever I have friends over and they want to order pizza I always suggest this place and they're easily impressed. Their online order form is easy to use and they offer plenty of coupons. I had a bad experience one time and their customer service was phenomenal and did everything they could to remedy the issue. I've considered other pizza places but given this level of customer service and quality of pizza, I'm happy to stick with Venezia's pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and wings and great sevice!! The Italian Stallion in Awesome.  My favorite pizza place to go to now."}
{"text":"The ultimate pizza to order when you and all your pals are cracking open cold ones. Tremendous hot wings that hold up great when delivered. Perfect pizza with a nice New York style crust that's just thicc enough, love the crust. Pesto pizza is amazing for a person like myself who isn't the largest fan of tomatoes. I've ordered here upwards of 30 times, yeah it gets busy but so does every other good restaurant. Super rare mistakes that are always dealt with in a nice way by the friendly staff. Never had a bad experience that wasn't corrected, nobody is perfect and people on this website need to understand that. 

Take a step back from your 1 star review before you post it and think about all the times you've messed up not only at work but also in life you irrelevant sappy emo snowflakes. Really makes you want to throw on \"The Smith's\" and drain your wrists in a bath tub right? Now go out there and be a better person, because deep down you are and together we can both put positivity into this world just by making a mental choice to be nice and happy instead of bitter and sad. Rock over London, Rock on Chicago."}
{"text":"My friend just found out some really tragic news... And I knew she wouldn't want to have to cook her family dinner. I scheduled a pizza delivery for their house and in the \"special instructions\" section requested that they write a bible verse of my choosing on each box. They went way beyond my wishes and hand wrote the entire verse out on the box. Not only does Venezia's make outstanding pizza, they're outstanding people. Thank you Venezia's, we'll continue to be your loyal customers."}
{"text":"Still a solid place for Italian. Returned after 6 months and again was served a solid chicken parmesan sub at $7.,99. Just mnake sure you ask for the sandwich special which gets you a drink for that price as well. Finally tried a slice of the pizza, but the BBQ chicken specialty slice of the day was only average. The BBQ sauce was too sweet for a pizza and there were no red onions on this version of the BBQ chicken pizza. Those are standard usually. Will stick to pasta and subs here for now."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in all of Phoenix. I have tried a few others and none are comparable. The pizza is delicious and the wings are just as good. Super affordable. This Tempe location is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Officially broke my diet for this and I have no regrets. The dough was nice and light, but chewy - just like a Jersey girl likes it :)"}
{"text":"FUK this place... I came here for the pizza and wing combo.... But now they are charging an extra dollar for bone - in wings.... NEVER again!"}
{"text":"If you like Costco pizza for double the price and half the size you should visit this place. First time and my entire family (6 people) all laughed about how are they in business with so many reviews selling Costco pizza. Save your money and time! I wish I could get my money back. It was a disaster arriving home with this Costco pizza. If it wasn't late I would have driven to Pomo pizzeria. NEVER.COMING.BACK!!!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this restaurant many times because the pizza is pretty good. However, every time I've gone there the past few years the tables and booths are always a mess and they don't seem to clean the place very well. 

You will always find ridiculous trash cans that have too small of holes to throw away your garbage. And to the staff-- empty the trash. It's always full."}
{"text":"We have become regulars at this location since moving back to Gilbert and I am always floored by their customer service and smiles. They are always willing to go above and beyond, have a wonderful team and the food is top notch. We came in for dinner and they are hustling out about twenty to go orders plus a full house of dine-in and working together like pros. Would recommend this pizza and food to anyone. Loyal customers"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here! :D One of my favorite places to eat. The pizza slices are pretty big. Two slices fills me up easily."}
{"text":"I'm not from NY and don't claim that this is authentic NY pizza as I wouldn't know, but this is delicious.  What more can I say.  For me it is a tie with Buono's for the pizza, but Venezia's has better tasting Pepsi so it gets the nod."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! One hour an thirty minute to get a pizza,sandwich and fried zucchini, On a Wednesday night.... The food was cold.. And they put onion on my sandwich I order specify without,do to allergies in my family..have order many times before. Even though the manager compete dinner,after I complained. We won't be back! Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST pizza place in Arizona! Everyone I take here always says it's the most delicious pizza they've ever tasted. Reasonably priced, and delivery is always speedy."}
{"text":"Wow!  Wrote this review not expecting it to be heard but low and behold got a note from the owner who wanted to make it right. He listened to me and took my review seriously. I gave him my number and he called me to say he takes my review seriously and will do what it takes to rectify the situation. He explained the new kids on the block and turn over in the business.  When the business first opened here it was great BC the staff stayed the same for a long time. But ppl move on... transient Arizona! So 5 stars for righting a wrong and making a lifelong customer out of me!"}
{"text":"Good pie. I enjoyed the meatball topping. Nice vibe in the place.  Went in there for lunch and the place got very busy all of a sudden. No real complaints."}
{"text":"Never had anything bad here - I've had the sandwiches, pizza, the calzones, the pasta, the wings.. etc.  Never been disappointed.  I wouldn't even say its my favourite pizza as I like the thin, crispy crust the most.. But I order here often as its just high quality all the time.  

Not a fan of the extra fees for ordering online and the delivery.. Other than that, prices are quite reasonable for the quality.  

Anyway... I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local pizza, hands down. Great either by the slice or when ordering a whole pie. Lots of variety in flavors."}
{"text":"It's good pizza, not the greatest by any means but I was very satisfied. I had pepperoni, sausage, black olive and mushrooms and an order of medium chicken wings. Service was great, atmosphere is nice and they seem to be popular because the place got busy real quick while I was here. I will go back for sure next time I'm in my second home city of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Very good food. An accuired taste for sure. A lot of variety and very delicious. 4 stars"}
{"text":"I love  their Italian stallion pizza!  My husband like their wings too.   They also have a really large delivery area as compared to other places."}
{"text":"Very tasty pesto grilled chicken and Hawaiian pizza. And I'm not even a fan of pizza! The size of their slices is even bigger than my face. They also serve awesome garlic bread and wings.

Delicious food. Quick service. Great price. Clean place. You can't go wrong if even Heisenberg himself, loves their food ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza Bianco!  I get mine with spinach, well done. I got the small and ate 1/2 for lunch, 1/2 for dinner which proportioned out perfectly. Literally ate pizza all day and still craving for more. And love that you can order take-out/delivery on-line. Frankly, I think this should be a must for all food businesses nowadays, cmon its the 21st century and Venezia's is definitely keeping up with the times and catering to customers."}
{"text":"I used to love Venezias but last time I had it it was just not up to snuff.  Seems to be steadily going downhill. The pizza we ordered did not have anything resembling BBQ sauce but BBQ permeated the pizza. Not a fan. Will stick to Barro's."}
{"text":"Wicked good! East coast approved pizza - love the boneless wings and the homemade dressings. We got a margarita pizza and my husband had to try the calzone (not my thing but he raced about it). It was a great pizza and balanced well. I recommend the wings hands down!"}
{"text":"NY style pie in AZ, nailed it! 

Pepperoni over sausage.
Blue cheese over ranch.
All Drums over all wings.


Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food is great.

However, customer service is -VERY POOR-

On Saturday, Jan 16, 2016, around 6:00 p.m., I called Venezia's, was immediately placed on hold. I understand being placed on hold on a busy Saturday night, not a big deal.

However, when the female employee answered my call, she either was a trainee, or, extremely distracted because I had to repeat my name 3 times, spell it out for her twice, and she asked me for my phone number 3 times, I tried to be patient and understanding. I did not shout or rude to the kid.

The reason I am writing a formal complaint is we were told that we could pick up our order in 30 minutes. My wife went inside, waited for her turn for pick up, around 6:40 p.m. She was told by the cashier that our order was not ready and would be in 10 minutes. So, she waited another 10 minutes.Now, it is about 6:50 p.m. 

She goes back inside, waits her turn for pick up, and was told that only 1 of the 2 pizzas ordered was actually made, somehow there was a 'mistake' and the 2nd pizza was only placed in oven moments ago.

My wife did not make a scene, or get pissy, but, with validation she asked how this many mistakes could be possible considering how many times I repeated the order with the phone rep and when she entered the location, paid, and even tipped.

So, here she is, missing a lot of the Cardinals/Packers playoff game, waiting for our order to be ready, already gave a 15% tip (not earned) and frustrated. She asked for the manager, explained all the details of the evening events and she was offered an $8.00 credit and a few \"Free\" Ranch dressing cups.

I am only writing this review in hopes that Venezia's will train their phone customer service/order taking representatives BETTER, eliminates employee distraction, and will be more accurate with their timeframe suggestions.

We don't expect 'money', or, 'Free' pizza, or anything at all, really. I simply want to Warn anyone in our area who is wanting a Pizza, that they will be cautious when they order, and know that they may end up having a frustrating, maddening, irritating, night that accompanies their tasty food. The food is Tasty, but, the customer experience Sucked."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite. Impressed with the place; clean and polite. Pizza was great. Love the family feel it has. Keep it up."}
{"text":"My go-to spot for pizza in Tempe! Venezias has great combo meals that include their pizza, wings, and salads. Besides having fresh ingredients, they also have a gluten free menu as well. There's always a slice of the day, daily specials and even a reverse happy hour  Also...ask about the party pizza challenge  Only complaint is that I wish they were open later but otherwise, great spot!"}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken ceaser salad I've ever had! The food is delicious. The service is always on point. I will definitely be coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Always good food and great service :) Taylor is amazing! Thanks and see you again soon."}
{"text":"My husband ordered from Venezia's tonight to my surprise, and I arrived home to a meal of build -your-own pizza, hot wings, and antipasto salad. Now, I am super picky about my pizza, as I have formerly worked at 5 pizza places and I am just sick of pizza in general, so pizza has to be stellar for me to eat it at all. Also, I LOVE wings and love hot/spicy food. And I love vegetables! So, I skeptically opened the pizza to see, and it looked pretty good actually. Wow. It really was amazing! Lots of toppings, and extra cheesy! Then I tried the hot wings and they were really yummy, too. I felt some heat, so I decided to try the salad to cool things down, and I gotta say the salad was a perfect salad: super fresh and crisp ingredients, the perfect amount of toppings. I was very impressed! Obviously this restaurant uses high quality ingredients and cares about the quality of the food.

Anyhow, even after I ate the salad, I wanted another wing...mind you only the second one.  After eating it, wow!!!...my mouth was on FIRE!! Now I like hot food, but holy moly these wings were HOT!  I drank milk, ate bread, and held and ice pack to my lips for 15 min before my mouth started to cool down! LITERALLY. So, what I am trying to say is, please understand that  \"hot wings\" means \"hot-as-hell\" wings...just sayin...I'm just trying to protect you.

I will definitely order from this place again."}
{"text":"Pizza is good when its good but it is not consistent enough so it is hit or miss. I don't like rolling the dice or flipping a coin on whether or not my pizza will be good this time. I stopped getting there pizza and go to Clockwork because they are more likely to deliver the goods right nearly every time."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in the valley. I drive 20 mins for Venezia's pizza because there isn't one close to me. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I give 2 stars for the food, 2 stars for the service. The new addition is nice. Due to my diet I can only eat one overindulgent meal a week. Out of all the pizza restaurants in my area this place rivals is one of the best. Tonight's experience was way under expectation from past visits. The service was lacking in courtesy as well as other nonverbal communication actions came off as rude. Such as not a smile the entire time we were there to ripping the credit card out of my hand during payment. Two different slices of pizza were served on one tray and toppings from one carried over to the other. I ordered a slice of pepperoni and green chili but didn't get the the pepperoni. The bottom. outside of the crust was overcooked and almost burnt. I also ordered a half order of medium chicken wings and they were somehow overcooked and tough but only slightly warm. I'm extremely disappointed in my experience tonight. Even the other pizzerias do not have green chili my next overindulgent meal may not be with this restaurant"}
{"text":"My dinner for tonight. Delivery was on time...actually 4 minutes early. Pizza was amazing salad was very fresh and crispy. Always love to experiment with all kinds of different toppings. 
Oh, and when ever I order their HUGE pizza that was featured  on \"Breaking Bad\" show my guests are going crazy!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was okay...I had the pesto slice...wouldnt get it again...Now the wings are another story! They were amazing! And the salad was really good too!"}
{"text":"This place is always solid. I have eaten at the one in Gilbert and North Phoenix one, and neither one has left me disappointed. 

The slice and wing combo is a good deal (that is what I usually get). The pizza slices are huge, and everything about it is good."}
{"text":"We were looking for take out for the Sunday night football game and came across this gem.  We currently live in Orlando FL, but are originally from NJ so finding good pizza is hard in the south.  We were skeptical having been our first time in Phoenix.  We were pleasantly surprised and delighted by the pizza and the subs.  We ordered a slice to taste along with a sub for the football game and we absolutely loved it.  Loved it so much we went back the next day and got another slice and tried another sub for the plane ride home!  Staff was friendly and the food came out quickly.  The atmosphere was great in the restaurant, reminded us of the Pizza joints we had growing up in NJ.  Highly recommend it if you are in town and just looking for some good Italian food."}
{"text":"Want to make a room full of people completely jealous? Need a way to make new friends? Call in an order for the \"party pizza\" with crumbled sausage and onions. Add a side order of ranch. Then, head over to your local watering hole (be sure you can bring your own food, duh) and wait. The look on everyone's face when this masterpiece is delivered is almost as good as the pizza. The good news is there might be enough to share! So. Worth. It."}
{"text":"Ugh! I took a friends recommendation, unfortunately. This is NOT good pizza, I have no clue how this has 4 stars on yelp. I am assuming cause it is in Tempe (a college town). 
We ordered a 16\" half pizza blanco - half supreme. 
First, the Pizza Blanco - It was bland and they said it was fresh cheese, well, I don't know how. There was nothing to it, I had to add every spice at the table to get anything out of it and didn't eat a whole piece.
Then, the supreme - This was slightly more edible, but I promise you, if I closed my eyes, I would think I was eating a supreme pizza from Costco. Again, the cheese was NOT fresh or at least not fresh and of quality.
Then the crust, I didn't eat it, I ate the toppings of the supreme only, because it was flavorless had no depth or crunch at all. And I only ate it because i was hungry.
The service is sub par and don't expect them to go out of your way or seem happy to serve you. 
Now, if you are like a lot of these reviewers, you might like it. But if you like quality good food with flavor and depth, and don't eat pizza and empty calories without thinking about it, you will thank me that you skipped this place. 
This is simply not good food, not good quality and not a true representation of good New York style pizza."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and the first time I've eaten here.  I ordered thru grub hub the ordering and delivery where decent.  

Both my daughter and I ordered the meat lasagna and each had a salad.  

We both thought there was way too much cheese we both ended up getting sick.  We got really bad stomach issues and vomit sensations.  Never going thru them again"}
{"text":"We live near so much good pizza that it's incredibly hard to choose now.  I had not eaten at Venezia's until almost 2 months ago, and we did the lunch special with a slice and a salad and a drink.  I forget the exact total, but it runs right around 6 bucks.  GREAT deal and GREAT pizza.

Then, we've gotten delivery twice and I am so impressed with their website and online ordering system.  It's the best I've ever used.  You can customize the order, apply a coupon code, and pay online.  Both times we've ordered online we got our pizza in approximately 45 minutes.  And both times the driver was very friendly and had the cc receipt all ready for me to sign.  

We've had the Meat Lovers, Pesto w/ artichokes & sausage, and the Hawaiian and enjoyed them all.  This pizza really reminds me of pizza I've had in NY.  The toppings are fresh and the crust is the right amount of yeasty chewiness.  Right now, Venezia's is my #1 choice for pizza."}
{"text":"Updated Review:

Night and day from my first order. After posting my last review ownership and management reached out to me to give Venezia's another shot. I was happy to accept. 

I placed the same order as last time but this time over phone instead of online. I experienced extremely polite staff and a quick and easy ordering process. The food was delivered in 30 minutes. 

See attached photos. The pizza was hot and delicious and the crust truly reminds you of a good NY slice. This time there was plenty of toppings and they were evenly spread so every slice was covered. 

The wings were the main reason for my poor review last time, this time they won me over. Ownership recommended that I order the wings with the sauce on the side so they remain crispy during delivery. Well I took is advice and sure enough, they came crispy. They were pretty damn good too. Word to wise - Order your wings with the sauce on the side - especially during peek busy hours. 

Venezia's won us back as customers. Way better than the PH and PJ chains. Check them out and let me know how it goes!"}
{"text":"Some of the tastiest pizza I ever had and they rock for delivery.  I've ordered from them probably a dozen times now and have tried just about everything on their menu and have not been disappointed.  They use fresh, wholesome ingredients and their mozzarella cheese is nice and gooey and creamy.  No fake stuff here.  Their wings are super killer too.  I love the Honey BBQ.  Their homemade sauce is really good and you can buy it in jars now.  I have yet to eat at their place because their delivery has been spot on.For NY Style pizza, Venezia's is where it is at.  Don't make me call the super!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for lunch the other day and it was pretty good. The slices are huge!  I usually need two to fill me up, but two was almost too much for me at Venezia's.  I could've just as easily been satisfied by one.  I got my slices to-go, but the inside looked nice and clean.  It's a good place to grab a quick bite. 

What I really like about Venezia's is that you can put whatever topping you want on a single slice of pizza, instead of having to choose from what is already made like at most other pizza places. They just put the topping of your choice on a cheese slice and pop it back into the oven.  Also, there was a nice amount of sauce on the pizza, I hate when there is no sauce!  The only sorta bad thing I noticed, which is probably to be expected when eating pizza, is that it was extremely greasy.  Even my coworkers commented on how greasy it was, but they didn't seem to care anymore once they tasted it!"}
{"text":"WE LOVE VENEZIAS!!!! We are probably addicted. After trying many pizza places near us we've found the one! The specials they have running are always awesome! They always deliver on time or earlier than they quote. Their wings and canolis are great too! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with this place! They have some of the best pizza in town! They never fail to disappoint with satisfying my cravings for a nice cheesy pizza."}
{"text":"Nice lunch quick fresh by the slice orders with specials everyday.  Def a return to location."}
{"text":"This place is not too bad, plus they are always putting out coupons. 
It is very close to my house as well, so that makes it even better.
I am not sure if they deliver, but they probaly do.
It really took me a long time to try it. I just did not think it would be all that. 
But, it is pretty good and with the coupon a great price.
We even got a side dish of meatballs to go and they were good as well.
As well as a few wings, awesome.
We got it to go so, I can't say much about the bathroom or inside dining."}
{"text":"First time ordering from them tonight. Awesome customer service and delivery driver! Their pizza is so good! And I'm normally a Chicago style pizza girl but I will most definitely be ordering from here again when I need to order for delivery. Oh and very good prices!"}
{"text":"Best pizza that I've had since moving to AZ! The two slice special is legit! Great value, a huge portion, and delicious! Glad I gave it a try, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are foodies hardcore! We don't eat out much because we prefer to cook at home. We used to order from Rosati's because they had the best pizza and stuff. Until we found Venezias.!! We're never going back, Ever!! You guys pay attention to detail which is IMPORTANT with food. We've ordered twice, each time something different. Every time it was AMAZING! The flavors are so perfect!  Thanks for making our dinner GREAT"}
{"text":"Football field size pizzas. Just the right amount of sauce cheese ratio which is hard to find. I love the crust which is nice and chewy (not to thick, not to thin). This place is not around the corner from me but I do make the trip to dine in. Good pizza at good prices. Clean restrooms (I always check them to see how clean the business really is) Thanks Venezia's"}
{"text":"WOW. I have been coming in for 6 years but TONIGHT Venezias out did themselves!!
After the Chandler Spooktacular- my daughter and I had a craving for pizza. I remember that Venezias wasn't too far so we called in a pick up order  for a 24 Inch Party pizza. (If you've never ordered this, it is GIGANTIC!)

When we arrived the parking lot was full and they were very busy. 

When we got inside we were in line and ultimately greeted by a very nice young lady. There were about 10 people working behind the counter- hustling and making pizzas. My daughter liked watching them working so hard. You could tell the staff were very organized and each employee was dedicated to their craft. I was impressed with the team work. 

We waited about 10 min (they quoted 30), and the pizza was ready. When my name was called, I had forgotten that I ordered such an enormous pie. How am I going to carry my two year old and carry this mammoth pizza without dropping either of them??? Oh... Venezias got me covered. They offered to help me carry the massive pizza to my car!! THANK YOU! 
The pizza only fit in my trunk because of its size. When we got home me and the rest of my family enjoyed the amazing Venezias. 

Thank you for the great service and scrumptious party pizza."}
{"text":"Get the finger-licking-good honey BBQ wings. The regular BBQ wings are pretty tasteless though. Convenient for popping in quickly and popping out and their party platters are decent for feeding large crowds. I frequent this place more because of its proximity to my place than the quality of their food."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with this place at all. First of all, when you order a pizza you expect them to deliver it to your door. The fact that I had to leave my room to go into the lobby which was a good walk from where I was and than the kid who did the delivery didn't even have any plates or silverware with him. I didn't get my full order when I told the delivery driver he said he would be back with it and didn't see him again. By the time I got the pizza it just was not very good"}
{"text":"I was interested in an inexpensive pizza place near where I live. Luckily this one is only about a mile from where I live. I went with my cousin, thinking initially what pizza shall we get? What toppings? What if she doesn't like this or that?
Yet, they had specials for the slices. Either a slice and drink, add a salad or wings for additional price as well. For the slice choices it was either pick one topping or do the supreme slice. I opt'd for the supreme slice and salad. I also ordered a side of breadsticks with marinara sauce. My cousin got the slice with wings (hot).

We didn't have to wait long for our food, I got my salad first and was surprised to how big the portion was. I was expecting a small bowl, but it was decently sized salad. Fresh greens and such, no complaints. Just the usual salad. Great ranch dressing. 
As for the pizza it was a large slice of pizza. Toppings were not overflowing, just the right amount. Pretty good pizza though. 
The breadsticks were fresh, hot, and fluffy. Buttered and seasoned alone was good enough. The marinara provided was decently sized as well, enough for all the breadsticks and some more. 

Overall the food was pretty great. I would definitely go back soon. They also have a lunch special for the slice combo, (times forgotten). Check it out."}
{"text":"this is basically the only pizza i eat. it's best when it's extra extra hot. their homemade salad dressings are so yummy. and their marinara is perfect- i could eat it like soup. don't laugh, you would too!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first visit to Venezia's. The food was delicious, well priced, and I love that they have wine on tap! Very cool. The staff was very nice and our food was taking a while so an employee came out to check what our order was too make sure they were on top of it. I definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best NY-style slice I've had in Arizona.  It's big, greasy, and tasty.

They lose a star only because it's not quite there with NY's best, and it has been a little inconsistent in the past, although I haven't had much of a problem with that lately.  

Great value if you want a lunch close to $5.  Even a college student will find this place affordable.  Their wings are also delicious, and I have lately found myself gravitating towards a slice and wings instead of two slices.

Also, if you found this place cramped before, you should know that they recently remodeled.  What was previously the entire restaurant is now the kitchen, and the dining room is more than twice the size the restaurant used to be."}
{"text":"I was picking up an order that my boyfriend placed over the phone.  He was told it would be ready in 25-30 minutes.  I headed over there at the 30 min mark figuring I would go for the later time so I wouldn't have to physically wait long.  As I entered the restaurant I was about to get in line when the cashier mentioned that she could help me at her register (having me avoid walking through the line.  how nice of her!)  I was thanking her as I was walking towards her and she raised her voice at me and said \"I can't hear you from over there.\"
Ok jeeze lady you didn't have to respond so rudely and so loudly.  I admit that I can be a bit shy and quiet when I'm talking, but all I was doing was thanking her.  Even if she didn't hear my thank you, she shouldn't have been rude to me and raised her voice.  She could have waited the extra 5 seconds it took me to walk over to her and then ask me calmly to repeat what I said.
I then paid for the to-go order, was told it wasn't ready yet, and sat down and waited.  After sitting there for a while I realized it was a total of 45 minutes and the pizza still wasn't ready.  
I walked up to the counter again to ask how much longer the wait would be, and before I even got to finish my question the same lady interrupted me and said \"WHAT'S THE NAME UNDER.\"  At this point I was already upset at the poor and rude customer service I was receiving, but I didn't want to cause a scene.  I politely waited an additional 10 minutes before the order was finally done and dashed out of here without any other words exchanged because I knew she wasn't worth my time.
I understand that they can be busy over the weekends, but there is no reason to be rude and short with customers.  If you can't handle the rush of busy restaurant, then you shouldn't work in customer service.  
I would have rated it a 1 star, but their pizza was good.  And kept well enough for oven reheating the next day.  But I don't think I'll be going back due to the treatment I received from the employee."}
{"text":"I liked that they offered gluten free pizza, but this food made me sick. Could've been the grease, idk. Two bites in and I started to get pain in my stomach.They also advertise as NY style, but it doesn't taste like NY pizza. This place isn't for me."}
{"text":"The way I see it...I'm not gonna go to New York and complain about Mexican food, not gonna complain about Seafood in Arizona, not gonna go to Detroit and complain about Hatch Chili...common sense tells me that a business will Use resources available to imitate what they are used to wherever \"back home\" may be. There's a fine line between complaining(crazy assumption that food should be the same as it's origin) and reviewing(telling us what the food tasted like, not what it \"should\" taste like) establishments. 
For this review, love the cheese pizza, Italian sub and hot boneless wings. 
Of course is the disclaimer that if an establishment actually claims ingredients, supplies, etc... Then it should own up to it's claim..."}
{"text":"Just realized I have NEVER Yelped over this place!! We absolutely LOVE EVERYTHING about Venezias! Pizza, wings, speedy service AND friendly service!! We found them almost immediately after moving out this way and have gone no where else for our Pizza and wings!!! If your looking for a great delivery service for pizza; this is the place!! Never have we had an issue and never do we intend to order our lazy day meals from anyone else! Thanks everyone at Venezias!!"}
{"text":"I ordered an Italian beef sandwich here and I have to say it was delicious! I will definitely be coming back !! 
My husband thanks you as well I get a little hangry when I'm hungry lol"}
{"text":"The pizza was tasty, although I thought the crust on my bbq chicken pizza was overly bubbled up with the cheese sliding all over the very middle due to the bubbly crust. I prefer my toppings throughout the entire pizza, not just the very middle and spotted here and there. My takeout/delivery receipt was fingerprinted with pizza sauce, so I was quite a bit grossed out to think the person/driver/pizza baker/cashier may have put their finger straight in my pizza."}
{"text":"Just grabbed a slice of cheese. It's a long slice, not a big slice. $3.02 for the slice, thats expensive. Cooked out of a conveyor belt oven, whack. What kind of place that considers themselves \"New York Pizza\" uses a conveyor oven? Shame. 
Slice tasted okay. The sauce is pretty good. But this pizza is equivalent to COSTCO PIZZA. Cooked in the same type oven, pizza looks and tastes the same. Except you can go to Costco and get the same slice for half the price. Probably get the same size pie at Costco for less than half the price from Venezias too."}
{"text":"Although this place isn't how it used to be, it is still one of my favorite pizza places in the valley. You can sort of tell when a place is getting commercialized and losing its touch and that's what I feel is going on here slowly but surely. I'm just going to ride the Venezia's wave until it completely fades. Still pretty good pizza....for now at least."}
{"text":"Love this pizza chain.  Great friendly staff. Loads of people coming through, great prices / portions and you will not leave hungry.  Ordered the x-large and demolished it."}
{"text":"I snicker a little as I read these reviews about the pizza not being \"authentic New York\" Pizza(doesn't just about every pizza parlor add \"new york\" to the mix?).. well, let me welcome you to Arizona =) I live right across the street from this place and never noticed it. Decided to give it shot and this place has become a weekly ritual. The pizza bianco(white sauce) is my personal favorite =D"}
{"text":"Great pizza. I would say in my opinion they are the best . They have a big menu and we love the party pizza. The new low carb bowls are great as well. Spinach salad is one of my other favorites. Delivery is always nice , prompt ,not greasy."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite when ordering in!  Of course, being a simpleton, I only get the cheese pizza, but it's sooooooo good!  Just the right amount of cheese and sauce with a great fluffy, yet crispy crust.  And you must try the cheesy breadsticks, which I think only come family style....aka, huge!  It's the size of a small pizza covered in cheese, but yet not too greasy.  

Prices are cheap, we get an X-tra large pizza and family order of breadsticks, and it's delivered in a consistent 45 minutes for $25 bucks with tip.  When I'm in the mood for a pizza party on my couch - this is where I call."}
{"text":"Great pizza joint.  We had the bbq chicken and supreme and I loved the bbq chicken.  It's a casual joint and the pizza is super tasty.  The hot wings were alright, a bit too hot.  I don't know what made this pizza tasty but the owners did a great job."}
{"text":"Oh man if you want good pizza come here! I've been here twice and im never disappointed. The pizza is amazing if you want a more expensive pizza (been eating $5 pizza forever forgot what real pizza taste like )other than pizza hut or domino pizza. The sauce is so good i dont know if it's homemade tomato sauce but it's perfect. The cheese,and meats are also very good. I've eaten once inside the restaurant and it was chill. Theres tv with sporta playing and it was clean. Love this place and any time I'm gonna spend money on a expensive pizza i will come here! And i only say expensive because im a college student."}
{"text":"Walked in and asked for a table for 7. Was told to check the back room for table myself as she didn't know if there was one available. Then she just kept asking my father what he wanted to order while i checked for a table. Also she acted as if we were inconveniencing her by being there."}
{"text":"Disappointed due to the warm bottle beer & the pizza being a bit underwhelming. 'Small' for a 12 inch. Just not worth the trip. I will pass. Too many other quality pizzerias to settle."}
{"text":"Love this place..It makes my daughter happy when she is in town always worked into the schedule to eat here!!!

The only thing missing that every other one of them  has that we have been too and that is Diet Dr.Pepper.!! 
It would receive 5 stars if they had my Diet Dr. Pepper.."}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service. I wasn't happy with my to-go order portion size once I received it as it was much smaller than what I would receive when dining in. Nate, the manager, called me and addressed my concerns immediately. I am all about customer service and I was very appreciative and impressed."}
{"text":"I go to Venezias almost weekly because I love their under 10.00 daily specials. Last Sunday I ordered an online special for take out and I accidentally over ordered two dozen wings. The manager, (I think his name is Jerome)was so kind, patient  and professional. He is a true gentleman! The rest of the staff and pizza & wings were great as usual."}
{"text":"Customer Service still matters. I called to order a pizza, and instead of being helped with my order, I was met with condescension. I was baffled by the rudeness of the individual answering the phone and we promptly cancelled the order."}
{"text":"Great spot for NYC style pizza. You can order at the counter by the slice or a whole pie. My fave part of thier pizza is the rich sauce, it soooooo flavorful. They have lots of specials so be sure to ask about those (especially if you're calling in an order). They have other items on the menu as well and I am sure I'll get to them. It's hard not to have pizza!"}
{"text":"went in for spaghetti with marinara.  plain tomato sauce, no flavor.  I said to the girl taking my order that I guess I should get some garlic bread to go with that.  instead of telling me that it comes with it I got home and way too much.  way to upsell.  arizonies don't know good Italian anyway.  I swear you could put tomato sauce on a dead cat and people here would love it."}
{"text":"IF I rate it 5 Estrellas, Don't Even Question it! If you know me you KNOW I Love Pizza!!! Especially NYC Style!! YummmmDelishhh, so basically this is NYGood it comes very close to the NY Taste, it's the sauce..Im telling you....Go Try a slice! Andale!"}
{"text":"I have been a huge supporter of this fine pizzeria open until this last time ordering there the past four times I've ordered food I have received food that was not me properly don't get me wrong the food is great when made properly but when you order for delivery and asked for a ham sub with only Italian dressing lettuce pickles American cheese and meat and you get it done completely wrong multiple times ordering from their somethings not right thereThey seem to be getting more and more and less consistent which is a shame because I always used to order from them I gave them two stars because I work with a three strike and they're already on their fourth Street for messing up orders specially with the prices that they charge your food should be made correctly every time"}
{"text":"Hands-down one of your places to come get pizza best customer service always treat you right and the wings are to die for! Plus the Parmesan dressing is the bomb!"}
{"text":"This place rocks ! Service is fast and friendly, pizzas are delicious. I had a hard time finding good pizza in the area. Try the bianco pizza it's soooo tasty !!!"}
{"text":"We tried this place a few more times after the first review. The problems seemed to have been resolved. Sadly, this was only temporary. Some of the girls working with food didn't have their hair up, and the food was cold. We are not going to risk getting ANOTHER hair in our food (happened multiple times), and I'm not paying for cold food again. Found another pizza place. Too bad."}
{"text":"4.5* 

We used to go to Venezia's when we lived in Chandler, their thin crust pizza reminds us quite a bit of \"NY fold\" slices, which are remarkably difficult to come by in AZ. When planning for Scott's 50th Birthday, he wanted pizza. So, I contacted AJ the GM at this location to see if they would deliver a catering order; he got back to me via email and phone by first thing the next morning. 

We stopped in to this location during late lunch and sat down with AJ to discuss our needs:

1) food for 25 people. 
B) I over order and overcook, always. 
3) we are from NY: no Ranch with pizza. Ever (no wings either. They are separate things!)
D) suggestions for popular items. 

AJ suggested their extra large (24\") pizzas cut square style, and we went with pepperoni, supreme, 1/2 white & 1/2 Margarita, and chicken pesto. We also ordered an antipasto salad, Greek salad, two trays of meatballs, and two orders of cheesy breadsticks. AJ emailed me a copy of the receipt and advised that we could change order up till 6PM the day of party. He was very responsive to my queries and changes, super nice guy! 

Mat the delivery driver texted me when he was on the way, and brought the aforementioned, along with serving spoons, two bottles of dressing, grated cheese and red pepper flakes, and plates with extra plastic cutlery. He was very polite and professional. 

All of our guests loved the food: those who have had Venezia's before were pumped, and newbies were raving. 1/3 of our guests are also native NYers, and agreed with the thin crust being the bees knees. 

AJ went above and beyond to assure me I'd ordered enough food, kept in touch, provided bomb food, and followed up today to see how the party went. It went perfectly thanks to the great food and service from Venezia's, and we will definitely visit again, sooner than later. Keto be damned: that chicken pesto pizza is terrific! Their sausage crumbles are spicy and delicious, and filled-to-order cannoli are great too. We are absolute fans!"}
{"text":"Love everything on the menu-- especially the cannolis, salad, and pizza! Garlic bread is to die for, I recommend it to everyone. Service is always good and food comes out quick. Can't say enough good things"}
{"text":"Love this place, there Pizza is always so good and love there antipasto salad. They're spicy buffalo chicken hero is so good, but I am sure whatever you decide to order you will be happy"}
{"text":"Great food, terrible service. I wish I didn't love their pizza so much so I could choose another place to spend my money. Spend $100 in food and they still wanna charge you for a side of dressing or a napkin to wipe your mouth. They're nice enough people, when they're not messing up your order. 

Go to Venezia's enjoy some great pizza and wings just know your service won't be the best and be ready to be nickel and dime'd..."}
{"text":"Was happy with this experience.  New to the neighborhood and was calling for delivery.  The employee helping me on the phone was helpful in explaining things to me and offering a coupon when I asked.  The pizza was good.  I liked the sauce and the toppings.  I actually preferred the pepperoni one to the meat lovers.  Delivery arrived right on time.  I was feeding 6 adults and 4 teenagers.  I ordered 4 large pizzas and that was plenty.  I would have been fine with 3."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!!! Really good pizza. Salad was good .philly cheese steaks are bomb. SUPER BUSY....that should say it all. :) staff were all professionals and super sweet. Keep doing what you are doing...ITS WORKING :)"}
{"text":"This pizza will change your life. I got some sun-dried tomato pesto deliciousness, as well as a slice of cheese pizza and I could barely finish one of them. I can't even imagine buying a whole pizza from here, The boxes are huge. The people behind the counter super nice. Who wouldn't love a super smoking deal on a slice of pizza?

Maybe people with a gluten allergy.....so, there's that."}
{"text":"I have only tried their pizza so far. Everyone has told me this is the closest to NY pizza they have ever had... ummm, no way!! I'm not putting it down or being a snob... it's REALLY good pizza, it's just not NY pizza.

Their sauce is amazing and the cheese they use is high quality. The dough, once cooked, has that arizona dough taste. But still a great slice of pizza!"}
{"text":"Great pizza great crust crispy wings and delicious blue cheese. This place has amazing gluten free pizza as well and a huge selection of food not just pizza. The atmosphere is ok I would have expected a pin ball machine or some video games for the kids but nothing!! They do have some tvs playing sports huge plus just nothing to do for the kids:(. The prices are a little on the high side but quality pizza and wings!! Definitely will be going there again!!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in the valley. The party pizza is the best. Not a fan of the savage here but everything else is great. Thin crust, light sauce and great cheese."}
{"text":"Arm length pizza. Having a hard time finding good slices in Arizona and coming from NY, I just wanted a nice place to have good New York style pizza. This place is it. Great specials for us broke students and cozy enough to watch the game and converse."}
{"text":"Went to try a slice of their cheese pizza yesterday. It arrived hot and fresh, and was GIGANTIC! As long as the serving dish, easily as big as 2 slices of pizza you'd get most other places. It was very tasty and a steal at $2.50. Next time I might have one of their slice specials, which are a dollar off from 2 to 5."}
{"text":"We eat here quite often and the food is consistently good.  One issue is with the Caesar Salad, waaay too much dressing.  The salad is tossed for you and now and then it is swimming in dressing.  The gluten free pizza is the best I have had, I actually like it better than the traditional pizza.  The one thing I feel they could improve on is being more conscious of the disposal of plastic that is used and discarded by their customers.  Looks like it just goes into the trash and truly this is not necessary.  Recycling is the way to go and not that difficult.  Sends a great message too!"}
{"text":"Tasty and they have gluten free. Just wish the gluten free pizzas weren't so small and expensive! But still good for GF pizza delivery."}
{"text":"I was craving pizza so I hopped onto Yelp to see what pizza places were highly rated and close to my home in Tempe. Venezia's caught my eye as I had driven by it many times and it had good reviews on yelp. Hopped in the car and headed there. It had a pretty steady crowd which was a good sign. I thought I would order a whole pizza, but then while in online I got into a dilemma. Should I order a whole pie or get slices and try several different types of pizzas. Since I couldn't decide on one pizza I went with 3 slices and even those were hard to decide on since they had so many choices. I had to get a plain cheese slice as you can never go wrong with the classic. I also chose a spicy pepperoni slice and a pesto slice. The slices were great and quite big. I think 2 slices would have been enough, but I chose the third one cause I had to try more. The place was nice and big enough for groups. It also was lined with TVs in case you wanted to watch a sports event so that was cool."}
{"text":"I called venezias earlier tonight and tried to order a pickup order. The person on the phone was rude to me and I was not able to complete the order. I asked my wife to call back and she completed the order but told me after her phone call that the person was rude to her multiple times. This is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Amazing ... I'm from the east coast and their pizza is spot on perfect!!!! Great food great prices, love the crust, sauce and cheese.. Chicken wings are good too"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for eight years now and will probably keep coming until I die. 

The staff cashiers are friendly and I never felt rushed ordering. Recently I was beyond impressed about how they handled overcharging me (slightly) on a beer on special. They offered to change the amount charged on my card or to just give me the difference in cash (that's actually unheard of for me). Big ups to them. 

The pizza really is stellar. The only bad thing is that the quality somehow varies, but the floor and ceiling of the threshold is still very high (when it's good, it's out of this world). 

I always always always suggest getting slice specials. It makes ordering a breeze and helps them with preparing pizzas to meet demand. They are very generous to when it comes to replacing older pizzas with new ones if you ask. Do your best to try the mahgarita pizza. It's very rare but it's worth it if you see it. 

One final note I would like to tell about this place is its generous ambiance. I'm actually a camper which is why I frequent restaurants without a wait staff so I don't hold them up. My friends and I bring laptops and cell phone charges and just chill here for hours and we have never once been asked to leave or move or anything. The staff will sometimes engage us and ask what we are up to because they are interested. I always feel a little uneasy that I'm taking up real estate there, but they've always let me feel welcome and for that, they have me for life."}
{"text":"Ripped in the lunch rush. Beware. We have been going to the Tempe Venezia's for years, mostly carry out on Fridays. Love their party pizzas. We came in with two small kids to enjoy an eat-in lunch and were rushed by a gruff employee who grew impatient when we tried ordering slices alacarte, upselling us on specials including fountain drinks we didn't want then charging us for the drinks we didn't get--huffing at kitchen staff when we changed to a to-go order. Ugh! Lunch for 2 adults + 2 kids was nearly $30. And besides missing drinks the slices were overdone greasy salt bombs. Highly unpleasant."}
{"text":"Talk to Dominic and resolve the issue. I understand issues happen it was handled in a timely manner. Last night got a pizza and hot wings. Pizza was real good hot wings were average. Will go back."}
{"text":"Venezia's is one of only a handful of places in Phoenix that I would go to for pizza. I always enjoy coming here for pizza at lunch, there is one very close to my office on Mill. This is a casual pizzeria, perfect for a quick bite. They have a decent variety of slices and a great meal combo at lunch. They have a decent regular slice and this is how I always judge the pizza place!"}
{"text":"The pizza is soooo AHHHMAZING!

What's with the cholesterol comment?! It's pizza man? What do you expect?

I love the workers and their attitudes, and especially love dipping my slices in ranch and blue cheese.  I love when people post negative reviews for such a great place.  

Talk to the managers if you had a bad experience! 

Did I forget to mention the PIZZA IS AHMAZING FOR FAST SLICES!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in the valley for wings. I love that i can get all wings, plain with sauce on the side. So delish i eat here at least once a week!!"}
{"text":"Better Ingredients, Better Pizza, Papa Johns.

The only downside is that we got in a fight about Harry Potter versus Lord of the Rings. Our family had a great time"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch at 1:30pm on a Friday. Easy to order, HUGE slices of pizza, decent prices and better specials.

Every open booth in the dining room was dirty, only offer plastic utensils...this is not good, the Calzone i ordered was great...but impossible to cut and eat with plastic utensils.

They do serve Mt. Dew...HUGE PLUS!"}
{"text":"Big slices, greasy pizza good for nursing a hangover. Their wings are pretty good-we get em hot. Only gripe is that every time we call for delivery, we get passed between two locations that do or don't deliver to our area. Seems like they can't make up their minds. Otherwise, the food is good and friendly customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great fresh sauce not too sweet or spicey. Just the right amount of char on the crust that is a bit chewy. Fresh toppings. Really liked it."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant today for pizza.  When I went to order, the pizza that they wanted me to order looked like it had been sitting out for hours.  When someone order's a slice, they run it through the heat and it still looks horrible.  I had a Margarita Pizza Slice today that they gal was upset that she had to make a new one.  Then when the slice came to the table, it was cold.  The wing sauce was good but the wings were not hot.  I will not be going back to this restaurant for pizza or anything.  Further the staff is horrible - Monday, July 6, 2015."}
{"text":"Always a consistent experience, delivery or dine in. It takes a little longer than most places, but the quality is unmatched. 

I've came here for lunch and had a slice, got a large pie to share. The favorite is just a simple pepperoni, mushroom and sausage with light sauce. Crust is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Thickness is not too thick not too thin."}
{"text":"If you wanna go and waste your precious time, come here! Spent 30 minutes on pizza that \"wasnt on the system\" they said it was a lot of people who didnt have their orders put in, but what a coincidence everyone arrived immediately or ordered and their food came out instantly, waste of time if you ask me , never going again!"}
{"text":"New York pizza is not made on a conveyor belt oven!  Electric, Coal or Brick are the real ny oven types.

Here they use the same oven that any Papa Johns, Domino's etc uses. it does not create a proper crust, but this is just one of the problems.

The crust seemed to have corn starch or excessive flour on it creating a paste in my mouth with many bites.

The staff seems to be a bunch of high school / college kids who rather be socializing than tossing pizzas.

the inside is large and has decent seating, but why come and sit here when there are many many better options. 

Even their coupon is misleading as with the 1 topping coupon you save a whopping $.75 on the first topping,

Don't come here for pizza it is low quality non NY style food."}
{"text":"One night last week, I decided on picking up some pizzas and wings on my way home from work for dinner. I wanted to try some place new. While browsing different menus of various pizza places, I was sold on this one because I saw that they carried golden wings which are my favorite.

On their website they had different specials and I decided on the family special which consisted of 2 large one items and 2 dozen wings for $31.99. Pretty decent deal I thought. I added an extra topping on each pizza and my total was just under $40. 

I like my pizza extra crispy so when I got home, I popped the pizzas in the oven for a little while to crisp them up. They were pretty good. I think it definitely made it more enoyable that I crisped them up in the oven for a few minutes. MY favorite type of pizzas are wood fired thin crust ones, but for NY style, these are rated pretty up there. 

Wings were decent. They are pretty good sized wings and the sauce was on point. I'd imagine they would be better eaten in house freshly made. The crispiness was no longer there after being closed up in a box and making the drive home. As you can probably tell, I like everything crispy :) But still I liked them. They also had a handful of other flavors to choose from but I'm pretty much sold on golden wings everywhere they carry them. 

Venezia would be a top pick if I was craving for NY style pizza. I would order from here again, or actually maybe dine in next time, so everything could be eaten freshly made. Also, huge plus that the restaurant looked cleaned and organized. I actually imagined it to be a little dinkier, but to my surprise it looked like a place that could possibly be suitable for a casual date."}
{"text":"Although the salads, wings, and bread that my family always gets with the pizza hasn't looked good enough for me to try, I love the pizza! 

Great crust, great quality toppings, great portions, great value."}
{"text":"I went in to Venezia's (my favorite pizza place) to buy some gift cards for my friends. They were having a special where if you buy a 30 dollar gift card you card 5 dollars yourself! So I bought 3 and got 15 free dollars in pizza cash. One of the cashiers, Joel, was even nice enough to give me a free slice on my way out!! All I'm saying is this place has great food and even better service."}
{"text":"Had take out last night and although the pizza was pretty good (not great as so often proclaimed), the desserts are what I'm reviewing.

Being from New York and having real Italian delis to shop at, I came to love a true Cannoli! THIS PLACE DOES NOT HIT THE MARK! 

As you can see in the picture it wasn't even filled correctly. The center was hollow and it's the filling that makes it so perfect. This cannoli was lame. At about $3.50 for 1, I would at least expect it to be made correctly. The taste was good, but again, not great. Big disappointment. 

Pizza = pretty good
Dessert = waste of money"}
{"text":"Every time I've come here the employees are just taking to eachother and standing around laughing. This time they completely forgot about my order. Just to be clear im the only other customer here right now. I watched for employees standing around and talking while I waited 15 minutes for my two slices of cheese pizza. Finally when I went up to them to ask about my food I saw an employee making food for themselves and then they finally started making my food."}
{"text":"Enjoy Venezias very much! Maybe too much After a few visits I realized that their pizza either was very greasy to begin with, or something changed with the recipe?? Not sure. Nonetheless, I like their pizza a lot, especially the by the slice deal. Maybe now it's not that greasy, but haven't been since it was way too greasy after three consecutive visits. Wings are delicious!! GET THEIR WINGS!"}
{"text":"Wow - finally a pizzeria that reminds you of a New York slice - until now, we haven't found anything in town as good as NYPD Pizza - but have to say, this was really good today - and the prices are better than NYPD - also, our food was out very quickly, and was HOT, which is a really nice touch compared to what you usually get!  We will definitely be going back, maybe to try the Party Pizza Challenge!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight because of the reviews from yelp. It did not disappoint! Got the meat lovers special and it was delicious. Also got the fried zucchini which were very yummy! Love that it's New York style and you have big enough slice to fold in half the right way! Definitely going here again!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Venezia's out since it was the closest pizza place to where I live; the fact that they have delivery helps because for some reason some chains who will remain nameless do not cover my area.  I'll say that the pizza is a 4-1/2 stars.  I liked everything about it - but still felt that Nicantoni's sauce was better.  What I didn't like was it advertised a special for Friday nights and that price was not given to me despite stating the special when I placed the order.  No tip from me; you can take it out of the discount I should have got.  I think it's cool that they offer pizza by the slice - very cool.   Nice atmosphere.  Can see why it would be a cool place to be when the sun goes down - quiet and pizza!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza.The extra large is more than two people can eat. Add to that fast delivery service, makes this a great place for pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is great! This is my new favorite pizza. The kids seem like they have fun working here. Great place"}
{"text":"Affordable slice specials and really good pizza. The staff is super friendly. Recommended to all!"}
{"text":"Word to the V jobs.  5.75 for a drink and 2 slices or a slice salad and drink...

I must hit this joint up 3 times a week.  it's so affordable and the pizza is legit.  Slices are large and they remodeled it, so it's comfy.

The slices are large and in charge.  May I suggest trying one with green chile and with Feta.  They hook up the tables with Garlic, Oregano, Parmesan and Peppers for you delight.  

Go here now!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza.  I love going there for lunch however I live in Phoenix and the closest is in Tempe.   Always fresh always good.  Great tangy sauce and perfect light chewy crust.  The golden wings are bomb too.  Love it!"}
{"text":"The pizza was really good. The breadsticks were lacking in flavor and too rubbery for me. They delivered the pizza on time and it was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and meets my expectations every single time I come here. The staff is down to earth and helpful. I've never experienced a problem from day 1 of coming here. Plus you can't beat their slice special prices."}
{"text":"Venezias has been my favorite go to pizza place for well over five years! I have tried a lot of other pizza joints and they have never compared to this place. They have awesome pizza slice deals throughout the day and literally the best ranch ever! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Have ordered from this same location for at least 3 years at this point and within the last 6 months every time I get a to go order something from my order is not complete or missing. Just tonight I ordered to go after swearing this place off and my fiance comes home with half the order because it was missing. I called and they pulled the order up and everything was put in accurately they just didnt bother to put the fries in the bag with my order. He said the order was read back to him before paying in person so why should he have to go digging through the bags to ensure everything is there as mentioned? Only solution offered by the MOD was for me to wait 30 minutes and come back and pick them up so I guess I will let my other food get cold while we wait for the rest of the meal to be made."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery. Awesome tasting. Awesome flavor. Perfect texture. Quick delivery. 

However, I tried to process a valid coupon code and it didn't work. I figured that I would place the order and call the company to explain the online malfunction and get the discount.

When I called, the lady said that she could not see any order under my name. I tried to give my name, my credit card number, and address, but this didn't help. The food was great, but their ordering system needs to be fixed."}
{"text":"Hmm,  been eating here off and on for the last several years;   and I've noticed a very definitive decline in quality of the pizza since they expanded this location.  The last two times I have ordered, once was for delivery; the other was store pick-up.  

Its a battle of pizza in Tempe, and when i spend almost 20 bucks for a pizza; I expect it to be pretty tasty.  The delivered pizza was not, in both sauce and toppings, it was nothing spectacular; and the delivery took almost an hr. Which, might of contributed to the pizza not being very good.

My most recent pizza, was in my assuming that a picked up pizza would be fresh and better than my delivery was. I was wrong; the white pizza (no sauce, olive oil and ricotta,) was possibly worse than the delivery. And, for 20 bucks I could of gotten 2 pizzas at jamies pizzeria in the neighborhood that I KNOW would of been better than this.  

Oh well, I don't know if their expansion has led to the quality going down, or that the place has many different locations now and as such whatever was special is no longer so, but its very obvious to me that whatever I thought was SO GOOD about venezias prior, is not. And I won't be trying it again."}
{"text":"Pizza was really good, sandwiches are super good....antipasto was terrible! The peppers were cut and thrown in, stem and all!!The timing was also really bad!! Everyone had finished eating way before my food came out. It weren't for their sandwiches and pizza I've never go back."}
{"text":"Why So smoky? It's like cheech and fucking chongs house in here. Visible plumes of smoke bellowing from ac vents directly above the line of people. Pregnant women and their children inhaling the noxious fumes. Not to mention subjecting your employees to that for hours at a time. 

Turkey sandwich, flavorless. Something is wrong here.. I'm completely stoned and it still tastes bland. The smoked mtn dew was good."}
{"text":"Just going to say.. I love Venezia's. I am probably biased considering that it is literal footsteps away from my house but I am definitely a regular. This place is great for dining-in. The slice specials are great and the environment is always fun. The pizza slices are HUGE and it's hands down my favorite place to eat pizza. I have had a few customer service issues in the past but overall its generally a great experience."}
{"text":"This pizza is quite delish.. but the cheese falls right off the pizza and the dough is not strong enough to hold it. Overall the taste was good and size of slices are ginormous. The prices are also a little higher then usual. The sit down atmosphere is family friendly and had nice amount of seating."}
{"text":"I moved from Albuquerque and this is a delicious little slice of home. 

Great pizza, great deals, good selection of toppings and salads. 

Go. Go there now."}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza in the Valley! Order a whole pie if you can instead of the slices. Slices are reheated and sometimes not the freshest. Awesome wings, friendly service, really good pizza. Try the Gold Medium wings and BBQ Chicken Pizza."}
{"text":"Papa WHO??? Venezia's has the best pizza in town, and I would know cuz I travel through 2 of them to eat here. This is THE PLACE to go if you are a pizza connoisseur. The crust is thin and crispy, and the sauce obviously fresh and homemade... The lil girl who busts her butt out front bussing tables, KAITLYN, is super friendly and can ALWAYS put a smile on anyone's face!"}
{"text":"This is for sure one of our favorite places to get pizza and wings. The green chile pizza is great here and the party size pizza is huge! I really recommend this place for pizza and wings."}
{"text":"Only had the garden salad and the bread sticks.

Salad was fresh, the \"homemade buttermilk ranch\" dressing was Top-Notch.

The bread sticks had a good flavor, not too salty, not too chewy, and the marinara sauce was very good too.

They are right beside the LA Fitness, and you can smell the Italian cooking as you are walking in or out of the gym...Yum.....:)  In fact, that's why I tried this place.

Will try the pizza at a later date.

The 26\" Party Pizza for $21.99 looks perfect for large parties."}
{"text":"Love Venezias!!!! Their pizza is great! I usually get a pizza slice and half dozen wings combo, and it never disappoints. Their honey BBQ wings are so yummy! Love this place."}
{"text":"It was Friday night and I was so famished that i could have eaten McDonald's food!! Ok, so I wasn't 3rd world hungry ; but i could no longer ignore these internal sounds that  mimicked desperate cries for sustenance . I opened the fridge to expose the desolate nothingness of condiments and cheap, processed alternatives to real food so i didn't have to many options.   I couldn't pass up their Friday deal, so i ordered the xl that i was going to order in the first place and scored another xl (cheese) for 6 bucks. Yup, Yup. Six slices of cheese for a  cheese pizza that would school any 5 dollar meal out there. Much like most consumers, who hate to wait for anything in this high speed era,  I started to get a bit antsy when it didn't come within 20 minutes I started to get the \"pizza paces.\" I wonder if it's comparable to an addict and \"the shakes\"?"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years and expect what i pay for.Quality food with superior service. I ordered last night with the tv on and music blaring on top of changing my orders to accommodate my guests. Throughout the call, Jaqueline remained professional and i didn't catch a hint of frustration. To tell you the truth, I would have accidentally disconnected the call had the tables been turned. This only solidifies me as a repeat customer. Thanks for the respect and amazing customer service. 
If you're a newbie, the pesto pizza will turn you into a fan and the Italian sausage could possibly change the heart of a vegan."}
{"text":"For years we have ordered pizza from a Chicago franchise.  For years we have been disappointed in the quality of the product and the customer service - let alone the price for the disappointment.  Off and on we have ordered from Venezias.  Tonight we chose Venezias and I can tell you we will never order from the Chicago franchise again.  

We ordered on a Friday night during prime time dinner hour.  It's the last weekend before school is out, hockey is on, the Cubs are on - NO ONE wants to cook tonight.  We placed our order online (easy to do, very intuitive webpage).  ETA was an hour.  At 1:05  the delivery man called, let us know the order was delayed but on its way.  The order arrived cooked to order - the ingredients were in place (didnt slide), fresh, and DELISH.  The hot wings....were HOT (temp and seasoning)!

Quality food, with quality customer service.  Well done Venezias....well done!"}
{"text":"Wow! Another great place I found using the Yelp delivery app! We ordered a 24 inch half cheese half mushroom pizza with a thin crust. It was delivered in about an hour. The pizza was slightly askew inside the box but the pizza was thin, the sauce was tasty and the mushroom were tender. This size is a definite for large groups/a family. The slices would be more to a true NY slice if there less cuts. It would have made it easier to eat and handle. We are excited to visit the actual location, however this will now be our go to pizza delivery place! And I must remember to tell them less cuts for a true NY slice."}
{"text":"Ohhhhhh how I love this place. I'm trying to be good and not order as often as I used to, but it's hard. Their pizza is so good! I was ordering once a week, and have cut back a little bit, but I'm craving it again. Everything I have had there is fantastic. I normally order either a cheese and mushroom pizza, or mushroom, italian sausage (theirs is AMAZING), and ricotta. Best. Pizza. Ever."}
{"text":"I catered this pizza in for an office function a week or so ago without trying it.  i did not get to try it at the work function, but employees could not say enough great things about it, it was obviously a huge hit at the office.  so, yesterday i decided to give it a try...it was really good and the salad i had too was great.  i will certainly be back, maybe for lunch during the work week.  it is very affordable and a really nice atmosphere in the restaurant."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch today and had the pizza Bianco special. Delicious! My 16 month old devoured his portion. The crust was perfectly cooked, the white sauce was balanced perfectly by the spinach. The restaurant was busy but service was fast and had my lunch in about 7 minutes. We love Venezia's."}
{"text":"First time ordering.  We had a XT large Supreme, (the works).  Definitely a great pizza.  Delivery was within time given.  Friendly service on phone and from delivery man.  Will gladly order again."}
{"text":"Pizza is good I'm just giving a bad review because there's only small and large. Nice way to skip medium size and have people buy the large"}
{"text":"Love Venezias! With multiple locations valley wide it makes it super easy to get my pizza fix! I highly recommend the pizza and the low carb bowls are good if you want a pizza alternative."}
{"text":"If your looking for quick, cheap pizza then by all means come here!  Meat lovers pizza was saturated with grease. Mariners sauce was from a can, just opened 15 minutes ago!   If you have even the slightest palate, this is NOT Italian food!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Phoenix.  They make their pizza with fresh ingredients and even have home made sauce and ranch dressing.  Their ranch is so good we buy it by the bottle to keep here at home.  Venezia's is a little more expensive than the average pizza place but well worth it.  They have daily specials and have a lot of coupons that usually get mailed along with the grocery store ads.  I also really like their salads."}
{"text":"my favorite pizza!! and ima pizza addict .. nomnomnom!!!"}
{"text":"The owner contacted me and apologized for the not -so-good pizza I had upon my last visit. I gave this place another try....
1) last time I had my boyfriend pick up the food so I never had any interaction with the staff. This time I picked it up. The restaurant is homey. I actually felt comfortable walking in and asking for my food instead of feeling like a burden as so many places make you feel. 
2) the actual food: margarita pizza was WAY better this time. More flavors all around. We finished the entire medium size in one sitting. :) We also ordered the \"famous meatballs\" the sauce and seasoning, again, terrific. Plus, the price isn't too bad either. An appetizer for $3.75, okay!! 

I understand the other great reviews now. I'll be coming back here - next time to try the wings :)"}
{"text":"Tempe is full of pizza places and if you like NY style Venezia's is the best. For me the crust is a make it or break for pizza since toppings can be very similar restaurant to restaurant. It's full of flavor with just the right amount of sauce that is great. The crust is thin and crispy but not so much were if you fold the pizza it's going to break in half.  My personal favorite is the chicken pesto since it's overloaded with chicken.  

While this is a pizza place their wings and calzones are also worth a try."}
{"text":"Fast delivery and delicious food!  Order the veggie plate, Greek salad, and the Italian beef sandwich for our dinner.  Only took at 40 minutes for delivery. The food was what I ordered, hot, packaged well.  I will definitely try them again."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from Venezias for years. We have never been anything but happy until today. I ordered a thin crust personal pizza for myself, as I like veggie and my family likes meat. It came out burned, and I did not realize until I got home. I called and spoke to the manager, who disclosed that the person who took the order accidentally asked for it to be well done. He offered to credit my account, and send another pizza out to my house. I was delighted, until the second pizza arrived in exactly the same burned state. Not sure what else I need to say in order to get a pizza that is not burned on the crust and well done on top. Too bad. Now I have two inedible pizzas. Maybe I just need to order regular crust, as the other pizza came out fine."}
{"text":"My go to pizza place in Tempe. Their customer service is superb. 

Tonight they gave me an entire Margh with Tomato pizza because they ran out of the individual slices. I keep coming back because this place is hands down the best. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Tempe this was one of the best places for a slice. However more recently they have been getting pretty bad in quality. I actually prefer some of the cheaper places in the area because their quality has gone down so much."}
{"text":"OH YEAH! Good quality pizza, speaking from someone originally from Chi-town where Lou Malnati's Chicago style deep-dish pizza reigns supreme, for Arizona. If you decide to have your taste buds bust through a brick wall the way Big Red does, try the Italian Stallion (but add some pineapple); and you are guaranteed to leave with the inevitable, kool-aid-smile of satsification. 

(Although, Round Table Pizza's Maui Zaui still has our heart)"}
{"text":"Having lived in New York for 32 years, i can assure you this is Definitely NOT a \"New York Style\" Pizza.  Clearly frozen dough, consistent with a Papa Johns.  Sauce was good.  Fake cheese and skimped out on the toppings.  Salad was wilted and lacked much flavor.  If you're drunk or just looking for a quick bite to satisfy your hunger, you'll be fine... but if you're looking for flavor and something to write home about, move on.  Sorry guys :-/"}
{"text":"I love their food!  My favorite is the Greek salad with chicken. The chicken is moist and flavorful - I mean it is perfectly seasoned and the greens are fresh. I feel like I'm eating healthfully while smelling amazing pizza smells.  I've been here several times the past few months with work buddies. We try to get there a bit early (before noon) to beat the rush. It can get crowded but the cashiers are fast and polite. They have a variety of ice teas which is perfect for me.  

I have had the pepperoni pizza a couple of times and it was good too. My favorite thing about Venezia's Pizzeria is the HUGE pizzas they make. I have had one to eat in, but sometimes we order them for work events. I love eating it cold.  There is something about cheese that was once melted and is now cold again. Call me weird, but their pizza rocks cold!

Yesterday for the first time I noticed the dessert case. Wow, chocolate cannoli?  As I've just lost weight, I skipped dessert but boy oh boy, did they look amazing.  (I really wanted one!)

This restaurant is on my regular rotation of places to eat lunch during work days and It will continue to be!"}
{"text":"Thank you Venezia's for the best pizza in Tempe. Been coming here for past year and never had a bad experience. In fact, yesterday(10/11/15) I ended up ordering 8 party size pizzas for a group and to be honest I was quite apprehensive. But in the end all the pizzas tasted just the way it has always been. Perfect!
Always has been a pleasant experience. Quick service and nice atmosphere to sit and dine. The wings are bomb too!
I will keep recommending Venezia's to others and keep visiting."}
{"text":"I've never been to NYC, so can't really say how \"New York style\" this place really is.  I don't like it as well as NYPD.  Venezia's pizza is fine.  Right up there with lots of other chains (Domino's, Pizza Hut, Peter Piper).  Better than most of them, in fact.  It's a decent pizza.

But in my opinion, if I wanted a pizza, this would not be my first choice.  Only a coupon would get me here instead of NYPD.  

Of course, if I lived close to this and far from NYPD I might visit more often just for the convenience."}
{"text":"I have come here in the past for dine in and have gotten individual slices of pizza. Slices have been pretty tasty at a low price. I like the environment. Last time we got one of those HUGE whole pizzas to go, extra sauce. Sauce was not really flavorful and the toppings were ok. The slices were abnormally larger than the already LARGE individual slices so it was really hard to handle the slices. Plates not big enough for slices so a portion the pizza is touching the table. Its not cut all the was thru in the box so you have to recut with your pizza slicer and the box is already soggy from the toppings and sauce so we ended up cutting all the way through the box. It was just an awkward experience and I don't think I would ever order this huge pizza again, even though I am more than willing to go back for the individual slices. It was an experience non the less and I can definitely cross this off my bucket list. They are probably one of the best places for individual sliced pizzas as far as variety and value but only order the massive pie if you know what you're getting into. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I've always really liked this place. However we quit ordering from there because every time our pizza was smashed on one side of the box. I haven't ordered from them for probably a year or two and decided to give it another try. I don't know if this is a problem with your box sizes and they're too big for the pizza or if your drivers drive like a maniac. But it is annoying. I did not order a sandwich I ordered a pizza. Totally irritated.  Not even worth calling the store to complain cuz I had to wait an hour and a half for my damn food anyways"}
{"text":"Wow what amazing pizza!  Huge servings and quick service. Got delivery from here and will definitely be doing it again!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the neighborhood and we wanted to try a pizza place nearby. We thoroughly enjoyed the pizza. I loved the crust and the meats and veggies tasted fresh. I will definitely be back. I love that they have cannoli too!! My only issue with this place was the bathroom. It was disgusting and based on the cleaning chart, hadn't been addressed all day."}
{"text":"Worst delivery experience here I've ever had in my life. Since than, I refuse to order unless my husband wants to take a chance at not having dinner for that night. I refuse to spend my money here solely because of how our problem was handled by management. We use to order delivery via online all the time. Months back I placed my usual order in a side salad and pizza. Estimated time was 45min to an hour. That's normal and use to be worth the wait. That night I got a call an hour and a half after submission from the manager stating they were really busy and the driver is headed out. I thanked him for the call and that we were absolutely fine with that. Well, a half hour from that call a female delivery driver knocks on our door. She hands me the food; I her money. Opened the box and no joke the pizza was folded into half. It was dropped at some point!! I grabbed the food ran outside barefoot to her vehicle before she got a chance to leave. I opened the box to show her and her mouth dropped. She said sorry but was completely dumbfounded on what to do next. I told her there's no way we can eat this and I asked her for my money back. She was shocked that I made that suggestion. Really- do you not have a brain?! She handed me my money and had the nerve to ask for the side salad back too since I wanted my money. It's a $4 salad!! It's now 10pm, you waisted two hours of my life, ruined dinner and now you want the salad. Okay I replied- ran back in grabbed it and walked back over to her vehicle. I'm still in shock. I called immediately and spoke to the manager. He did not apologize nor credit us for the trouble. You guys lost a regular, and a good tipping one at that. Thank god for grilled cheese."}
{"text":"I have them 2 stars because of the pizza dough!
A greasy slice with chicken and pesto, I think the pesto was made with \"expired\" basil: no taste what so ever...Caesar salad: generous with pseudo-parmigiano cheese but lean on dressing.
I am glad I only spent $8..."}
{"text":"Pizza was not what I ordered, we got a cheese pizza instead of toppings I wanted. I think that the website needs some work to make it more user-friendly.  I did enjoy my Ceasar salad. The wings were just okay, nothing special. It took almost an hour to get our order. Probably won't order again."}
{"text":"My first 5 stars over pizza!

I have never seen a pizza so big as their monstrously large beast of a pizza they have here! It took the entire table literally!!!

The pizza here is rather tasty too and I am not a pizza eater often... Good flavor and for the extreme serving size of the one we bought it was very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings!!! We just moved to the area and thought we would  tried this place out. Turns out it was a great idea! Not much of a \"eat in\"type place, but cozy is good sometimes. Staff was very helpful over the phone and when I picked pizza up they were great! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I find this pizza the most flavorful around. People are nice mostly....sometimes wavering on professionalism. Waits can be a little long. We dig their ranch for salads too."}
{"text":"I LOVE THERE PIZZA! and the Honey BBQ Wings are amazing! I love the sauce! frequent visitor! Even their gluten free pizza is good!!!"}
{"text":"This place has its off-days. The pizza isn't exactly fresh every time I visit. And also, I pre-ordered a couple of pizzas for my husbands birthday, and requested the pizza come to our office at 11:30. Mind you we are less than 5 minutes away from venezias and the pizzas arrived cold!! What happened? I was very disappointed and embarrassed, as I was telling all my office buddies how fresh and yummy these pizzas are. All the money I spent and the effort I made to pre order, and I get old tasting pizza. will not order delivery again."}
{"text":"The pizza is always tasty and hot. Very good combo choices and they have quick service."}
{"text":"The pizza place from the show Breaking Bad delivers some solid slices of pizza! New York style pizza that can be bought by the slice. Large pie cut pieces, a calories lovers dream for racking on some serious gains. One of your better options if your looking for NY Style pizza in the Arizona Desert."}
{"text":"Our home recently burned down so we're eating out a lot. We went here for lunch and asked if they had a student discount or something similar we could use. The lady who rang us up said there wasn't anything they could do. I understood. 

They soon brought out a pizza we didn't order and said it was an extra they had and didn't want to throw it out. We told them how much it meant to us considering the recent tragedy we are going through. 

The waitress went in, told the manager, and she came out a couple minutes later to say they comped our meal. Its kindness and generosity like this that gives a great business with amazing food the human aspect we need in this society and the support which has been helping us to cope with our situation. 

It doesn't have be a grand gesture either! A lot of little things make a HUGE difference to those who will appreciate it like us. 

Thanks Venezia's!!"}
{"text":"Want pizza and wings but tired of Domino's, Pizza hut, and Papa John's, but still want the average taste of average pizza? Give this place a shot.

Wings are great. Pizza's nice, too. Nothing fancy, but they do have this extra large pizza that is so big I had to put it in the trunk of my sedan, so there's that, if you like a bit of novelty. All in all, an average pizza place. The staff is either helpful and friendly or eternally cursed to never feel happiness again. I think you get a 50/50 chance of either.

I'd recommend this place for take out more than dining in."}
{"text":"This pizza is pretty good, but definitely not the best around by any stretch of the imagination.  All the food I ordered was pretty decent quality though.  I will go back when I am in Tempe."}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty much an average, there's nothing too unique, other than the fact that is very consistent.

Although they do do a good job at thin crust pizzas and a fairly good Caesar salad nothing really stands out to me."}
{"text":"Venezia's was listed as having good pizza.  I came to try it out and found a \"reverse happy hour\".  This is $2.00 slices and $2.00 any beer.  Nice!  I had a slice of pepperoni and a couple Stella's.  The pizza slice is yuge and the beer is cold.  The staff was friendly and the service was fast.  The reverse happy hour is after 8pm, all days, per the sign.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Very dissatisfied with the food and service. Made our pizza wrong two times. And the second time we just ended up eating the pizza because we didn't want to wait for them to try making it again for the 3rd time. The garlic cheese bread came out to us after our pizza had arrived and tasted like something made at home in a microwave. Would not eat here again"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite delivery pizza in Tempe, the quality is ALWAYS amazing and the ingredients are fresh. The crust is a new york style, and the slices are big. The chicken wings come in many different flavors and are very meaty and not fatty at all, they have those perfect chared crusty bits on the outside, and moist and juicy inside. The pretty much have something for everyone. I am a huge fan of their greek salad and calzones (easily feeds 2 people).. I can really go on and on about how wonderful this place is, but you need to experience for yourself."}
{"text":"FOOD: Delicious, affordable, and large portions! I had a large pizza, cheesy garlic bread, and the hot wings and everything met my standards for all those types of food.

SERVER: Friendly but busy. Pretty average, I'd say.

HOSTING: No hosting if I recall, just order in line and then grab a seat wherever is open.

AMBIANCE: Casual, lots of space which is nice for when it gets busy on the weekend.

Solid pizza joint. Bring friends and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ordered a $18 pizza MARGHERITA with extra tomatoes. Got three thin slices of tomatoes and a few pieces of basil but nice amount of cheese. Please add more basil and tomatoes which are pretty inexpensive. I had to add my own after I got home."}
{"text":"I've had pizza on the east coast from NYC to Miami, west coast, in several western states, and when island hopping and this is one of my faves.  The sauce tastes fresh and is flavorful.  Have also had their pasta, lasagna, salads and desserts.  Was satisfied with all of it.  Had to go 4 stars however because I think their \"combo\" pizza, with all it's veggie freshness, ends up being on the soggy-side typically (likely from all the moisture from the fresh toppings ... downfall of greatness).  This is not the case with their other pizzas so I forgive them."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming our favourite spot for pizza, especially when we have the boys. We've never had a bad slice, and even their pastas, salads and canolis are really good. 

They have something like 8 different slice combos: some with one slice and a salad, some with a slice and wings, two slices, one gourmet slice and a salad, etc. Every meal comes with a drink. And the prices are fantastic! $3.50 for a slice and soda, and the slices are huge! I usually can't even finish a slice. $5.50 or so for 2 slices and a soda. About the same for a slice and a salad. I mean, really, you can't get much better than that! And their pizza is pretty close to perfect. I'm a fan of their sausage, their pepperoni and their meat combo. The veggie pizza got rave reviews from my partner, and she loves their salad! 

If you're not a fan of the college crowd, this may not be the best spot for you, especially on a Friday or Saturday night (it is close to ASU after all). But if you don't mind the noise volume being slightly on the high side, then do yourselves a favour and swing by and get a slice!"}
{"text":"This place is great on pizza, prices, location and friendly staff. Like mentioned in a previous review the estimated order time can take a little longer then expected. A few times I was told an estimated time, arrived around that time and the food was just being placed in the oven. But other than that everything is delicious."}
{"text":"I wanted to review this while it was still fresh in my mind. Before I just recently went vegan, I ate here and the service was great. Place is clean, busy, and always bustling. It's better to go in and get it for takeout or sit down than to get it delivered, because their delivery can take a while. 

The pizza... was okay. I'm a bit of a NY pizza snob, so it wasn't BAD, but just wasn't the best I have had. It is, however, the closest thing to NY pizza in Mesa. There's quite a bit of cheese on the pizza, and it folds -- which is essential if you're a NY pizza person like me. 

The sauce was pretty sweet, and kind of tasteless, which is why this is a three-star review. Most of the flavor came from the cheese, not the sauce -- which isn't how pizza should be. Crust was good, thin, but not mind-blowing. Usually for amazing Napoletana pizza, I go to Pomo in Gilbert."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Their pizza never disappoints and I have high pizza standards since I originate from New York! Yum yum!!"}
{"text":"We used to order frequently from these guys with no problems. The last 2 time we ordered delivery we end up with soggy pizza. This time the ended up with this pizza that looked like the box was tossed around before we get it. Totally disappointed."}
{"text":"1. Great quality, size pizza, salad, wings for the price.
2. Great pizza sauce and wing sauce.
3. Pizza could use a lil more sauce, more ranch for salads."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the Valley to get pizza by the slice. For a whole Pizza, I'd go somewhere else unless I'm planning an event or something. They a friggin huge! It gets very busy on Friday and Saturday evenings but is pretty easy going the rest of the week. Love it!"}
{"text":"My top tip is to go for slices. I have much preferred when I've just gone for slices, any time I got the pizza it has been disappointing. I think the pizza is too greasy. Maybe when you get the slices that have been sitting out for a little while and then get reheated, it takes off some of that grease and cooked the cheese a little more. I love the slices!"}
{"text":"Okay pizza,  not crazy about the sauce on the pizza. Gal at the register was not very helpful while trying to place our order.  When we sat down I witnessed her itching her nose quite intensely and never saw her wash her hands.  Ewwww!!  The service was poor, although they had lots of staff in the kitchen, when our wings arrived,  the young man didn't ask I'd we needed anything and when our pizza arrived, they didn't even serve the first place.  Very disappointing.  Tables were dirty and the tray host to hold our pizza next to the table was filthy.  This location could use some deep cleaning work all the staff behind the counter.  Not sure I'll dine here again."}
{"text":"Messed up my order. Had a bunch of the people working there walk by me while i was waiting for help. The ones that helped me were jerks. I asked for some ranches after i bought a 15$ pizza they said it would be a dollar after handing one to somebody for free right in front of me.  If your a hipster mill jerk you will fit right in. Never again. NEVER."}
{"text":"BOMB.com, it's also cheap! Service quick and fast and it has a great taste. I come here every time I come to AZ! Totally worth that drive"}
{"text":"I've never lived on the north east coast, or in Chicago, so my standards for good pizza might not be the same as some of you.  However, if the ingredients are fresh, the cheese is real, and the pizza's cooked perfectly, I'm in.  It's really tough to get all of these in a delivered pizza.  I tend to stay away from the major chains because duh - but Venezias has never disappointed.  Now - I can be talked into pizza more often than I should, but this place also has great cheese bread and salads.  And we all know that nothing dampens the guilt of a greasy pizza like a salad covered in ranch.  So - check this joint out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Until I stopped eating out so much, I ate here at least once a week. Now it's once every few weeks. This store has great staff -- manager Chad is the bomb! The recent remodel expanded their seating, and it's easy to see why the other neighborhood pizza spots have closed down or struggled. The pizza and pasta here are great, the wings are very good and the sandwiches (while pricey) are outstanding. 

I have several out-of-state visitors each year and we never fail to stop at Venezias for a slice special. If they are lucky enough to hit the spot at the start of their visit, they always get in another meal before heading back home. If they don't go until shortly before their departure, they ask me, \"hey! why didn't you take us here sooner!\""}
{"text":"We love this place. Have lunch here a couple of times a week.The \"combo\" pizza is excellent, and the lunch special with a side salad is a bargain. The staff is friendly and even remembers our names. So glad we have this Venezia's in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My last few visits to Venezias have been enjoyable. I have always been a fan of their pizza. Awhile back I noted some of the cashiers having a snotty attitude but that seems to have cleared up. I imagine with it being seemingly mostly college kids running the front, it's like a revolving door. Regardless, no complaints as of late, just great pizza."}
{"text":"Super love this pizza.  The sauce is so yummy.  When you order takeout the crust is a little on the soggy side but it is still beyond delicious.  I don't love the boneless wings but every other thing I've tried is really good.  But the pizza is too notch!"}
{"text":"First of all my wife and I were NOT impressed with the restrooms. Not very clean and no towels to dry hands. We ordered a combo slice. The crust was soggy and really not good for $4.47. Maybe she charged for water?  Anyway, we will not return. Mods is MUCH MUCH BETTER."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Got take out there on a random Tuesday because i happened to be in the area. . Staff was friendly.  They had a yelp discount at the time i used.  Thanks guys! Great find."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Arizona by far. I didn't think I'd find anything close to authentic New York pizza so far from home but this place surprised me. Pizza and wings are my ultimate comfort food, and this place does both extremely well. Pizza is simple but close to perfect. The wings although not quite as good as ATL Wings, they are damn good. Try the 24\" party pizza and get the wings extra crispy. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This will be the last time I order from here. It's one thing for a restaurant  to be hit and miss, but this is ridiculous. What was delivered  tonight was just grotesque. We order a pizza with extra cheese, extra pepperoni, what was delivered  was a spotty mess, a few random blobs of cheese here and there, huge gaps of just sauce, and the total thing undercooked. Is leaving something in the oven a little longer so terribly hard? Is an even coating of cheese really perplexing? Luckily, there are many other pizza joints to choose from."}
{"text":"I had never even heard of this place...especially since I'm a West Sider! However, some friends were in town for the night and found it on Yelp.  Glad they did.  Made the trek and ended up having some really tasty pizza.  Perfect sauce/cheese ratio and the crust was PERFECT! Can't wait to go back and try it again!"}
{"text":"Love Venezias! The pizza is great, and the wings are awesome. I am from Buffalo, NY and thier pizza & wings are the closest I've found in the east valley if you're from that area you will enjoy them. On a side note, we love that they give you celery and carrots with the wings, few places still do that.  We order from them often, the staff is always very nice and helpful. Delivery gets busy on the weekends, but it seems like they always beat the time they quote :) And they always attach coupons. Good ones, you actually want to save and use!"}
{"text":"Truly the most inefficient restaurant that I eat at, or have eaten at, Venezias is a place with good food but little idea how to properly serve it. 

As a native northeasterner I've been to many pizzerias but I've never been to a place that takes your order and takes your name when all you want is a slice of pizza and it's situated two feet to the left of the register. 

Please, just take my money and then scoop me a slice onto a plate and hand it to me or scoop it into the oven and then wait on the next person.

Venezias makes things far more complicated than it has to and I've had my order screwed up numerous times there. 

The restaurant has something called a Party Pizza. It's the restaurant's largest size pie. It's the slices from that size pie that go on sale as individual slices. If you order a pizza pie to go that isn't a party pizza (say a large or XL) you get a different size pizza that I believe actually tastes different. 

The slices are actually excellent. It truly is NY style Neopolitan pizza and the chicken wings are good too. Service is nothing what you'd expect in a pizzeria though.

It's NY style pizza but not NY style service. Everything is done slowly and overly methodically. The Tempe location is a crowded, narrow, suck-in- your-gut to pass by someone kind of place. That's not unlike other pizzerias, but in other places you only have to wait around for your order if you have something that needs to be cooked. 

Venezias makes you wait in some kind of pecking order to get your slice when a server behind the counter reads your name off of the register receipt. That's just bizarre. For a small cramped place that gets crowded during lunch they waste so much time asking every customer their name and then typing it into the register so it prints on the receipt. 

Also, this is a pizzeria, not a fine italian restaurant. There is not a need for luxo-looking pleather booths and chairs to go along with fancy new tables. The old rickety ones were just fine. 

This is a grab a meal and go place, not a break out the candles and wine kinda joint. The metal tables and chairs you have outside are just fine. The new accommodations take up valuable space in an otherwise cramped dining area.

Good pizza, good wings, strange service and prices that have risen steadily over the past few years. It it were more efficient I'd give it another star, I'd even go there to eat more often than I do.

Addendum: As of the Fall 09 this place has expanded and is actually too big. It's quite comfortable though and patrons seem to spend a longer amount of time there than before. There are a few flat screens on the wall too. Their method is still strange  and they call slice orders out over a microphone. Sit in the back dining room and you might not hear your name. Service even got a bit friendlier. I added an additional star (going from 3 to 4) for the renovations and friendlier service."}
{"text":"Take the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I have been craving a good New York style pizza ever since moving to Arizona from the north east and while this may not be as good, I think it's as good as your going to find...or at least one of. The problem I think is in the Water Arizona. I ordered a pepperoni and Italian sausage and while I was hopeful it would be good, I really didn't expect it to be this good. The crust is great, the perfect combination of crunch and chewiness. The sauce was nice and tangy (they definitely didn't skimp on it either), and they loaded the pie with ingredients. Pepperoni could have been but I am afraid I have been spoiled Grimaladis and their imported aged pepperoni from Italy (Sorry Venezias but no one can top it). I will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"After my last review, the manager contacted us right away, by phone which was cool. They gave us our money back in credit to give them another chance, we did. It's nice to see that they care about their customers, but I just think the kitchen needs better training. We ordered pizza, wings, and a calzone. Once again half of our order was wrong [ on two separate occasions] and our calzone was extremely soggy, it wasn't from sauce, it just kind of melted off our fork while eating it, it was pretty gross. But for some reason we still on occasion order from here, so my two star went up to a 3."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Their pizza is terrific and their salad is good too. Their ranch ... yummy! They have great wings too. Service is excellent!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Venezia's on and off for a couple years now.  At first, the thought that kept going through my mind was \"Man, this doesn't even come close to Jimmy and Joe's\".

Fast forward to today.  J&J's keeps raising their prices while the quality has gone waaaaay downhill, while Venezia's keeps tasting better and better to me.  I like it more than Barro's these days.

The great things about this place are that the prices are very reasonable (in fact, we've noticed they've actually LOWERED some prices in the last year!), you can get slices from open to close, and the staff down there is really cool.  They know my wife by name now!

It's great to know that we've got a more convenient place to go for pizza when we don't feel like waiting for and making the drive to Oregano's."}
{"text":"Just had this one time and one time only and it gave me food poisoning. Will NEVER EVER EVER EVER eat this again!!"}
{"text":"Great food when it's served to you . We ordered 2 salads , a calzone and a slice of pizza . We get the slice and calzone and was asked if I received all of my food . I grabbed the food and one of the workers said oh sorry someone else will make it . We're done with the shared slice and calzone and I go up and ask about the salads that are still not served . Mind you the workers are now talking among themselves since no other customers are in line for  food . Finally the salads come over in a all bowls that take less time to make then the slice and calzone together . I wanted to bring to the lack of attention that not only happens to your place and also other places that I don't spend money at anymore for the above reasons"}
{"text":"I was searching for great pizza... I found it.. I'm from Chicago and I must say this pizza is pretty good.. And I am a harsh pizza critic!! Try the white pizza!! AMAZING"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! We had planned to go to Oreganos, but it was jam packed, so I just searched for the next closest pizza place. So glad we stumbled on Venezias! Way better than Oreganos, and super fast service. The workers were all friendly and helpful. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, love Venezia's.   We traditionally get a pizza to share but have definitely taken advantage of the individual combo meals as well.  My kid loves the Golden wing sauce and the hubby rants and raves about the Italian sub with the giardinera peppers they put on it.  I say you cant go wrong with a slice.  Love the flavor of the sauce and whatever special seasonings they bless the pie with!   Plus the staff is always friendly and personable.   Too good not to try!"}
{"text":"Visiting from LA and found this place. The staff was very friendly and courteous. The food was awesome. The pizza  was delicious. Perfect crust and the right amount of cheese. We also ordered the family style spaghetti  and meatballs. OMG super tasty  We came hungry and left very full and satisfied."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this because I've been eating at Venezia's since 2003. I've witnessed 1st hand how much the business has grown. Unfortunately the customer service has greatly declined. Anna and adorable young lady with dark hair, a pixie cut, really cool black glasses, and a horrible attitude. She couldn't crack a smile even after I offered her a compliment. No worries, everybody has his/her bad days, right? Well she also managed to mess up our order not once, but twice and never apologized... Or smiled. The food is AMAZING! I didn't think the pizza could get any better, but it gets better every time. It might be good to explain to the staff that making customers feel welcome is what they are paid to do. Customer service isn't for everyone... Maybe Anna is destined to launch an awesome \"start up\", but being nice to business patrons is not her niche."}
{"text":"The Good: The food is consistently good.

The Bad: The girl behind the counter was kind of a snob. A 'Hello' or even a smile would've been appreciated before asking \"Do you know what you want.\"
800 on a Sunday night took 20 minutes to get our food for take out."}
{"text":"I recently went here and ordered food for pick up, the line was extremely long so it took about 20 minutes extra then the expected order. The manager comped some food and was extremely helpful with my order. It was honestly what made me come back, the pizza is also great and the price does not break the bank."}
{"text":"I love Venezia's! They have some of the best pizza I've ever tasted. They have the perfect amount of toppings and aren't super greasy. The pizza always has lots of flavor. Every time I've ordered everyone has been super nice. The food comes quickly if you order in, although whatever time you have to wait will be worth it. Trust me! 

The hot wings are always cooked well. They are just enough crispy enough and the hot sauce is amazingly tasty. You might not be a fan if you don't like vinegar, though. I tend to get the chocolate cannoli a couple times a month because it's just sinfully good. I had never seen a chocolate covered cannoli before, but they sold me on it. I would buy from them on the cannolis alone."}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty tasty, and the slices are HUGE- my stepdaughter got three meals out of a single slice.  I think they put entirely too much cheese on their pizza.  I like to be able to taste the sauce, and not have to search for it under an inch of gooey cheese.  I recognize that I'm probably in the minority in that sense.

The sandwich I had was so-so.  It's called the \"Italian w/ peppers\" or something along those lines, but there were no peppers on mine.  I like that they serve Boar's Head meats, because as far as lunchmeat goes theirs has the least amount of junk in it. 

Their fries were awful.  They tasted like reheated fast food fries.  I paid an extra $1.25 to \"upgrade\" but I won't do it again. 

All in all though, I'm glad this place is in my neighborhood.  It's clean, cheap, quick and the pizza is FAR better than any of the chain places in the area."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Slices are huge and the wings are awesome. Great lunch specials for like 8 bucks and it includes a drink. Sweet Chile wings are where it's at. Go to slices are pepperoni, Hawaiian, and chicken pesto. I have not had anything bad there. Worth a try for sure."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just the style but I like crispier pizza. This was just kind of wet and flabby. Average at best. Service was good and the restaurant clean."}
{"text":"Venezia's is the main pizza pie house for us when we travel to the Tempe area. Lucky for us were down several times a year. Fresh ingredients. Open kitchen so you can see everything they do. Lots of easy seating with quite a few TV's so you won't miss your game. And then there is this:  the pizza bowl!  If you typically avoid carbs, Venezia's found the solution - their pizza in a bowl. Layer by layer of cheesy goodness. Just no crust!  Oh, and for those who say they couldn't \"not\" have the crust - you can cheat with some cheese bread on the side :). Try it. You'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Sometimes they are a little light on the sauce , but overall a great New York pizza place. Also there wings are bomb! They also having breaking bad memorabilia since it was featured on the show which is a plus."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since it opened and never had a bad experience until Saturday night. We always get delivery (live just down the street) we ordered 2 pizzas and wings, the pizza tasted like it was sitting under a heat lamp for hours, it was not good at all and we ordered honey hot wings (usually awesome wings) and they were not honey hots the flavor was vinegar and hot sauce. Hopefully this was just a bad day for them as like I said before we have never had a bad experience from this place before."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza - and this from a person who is not a fan of pizza at all, but this place could actually convert me! Tasty crust, yummy fresh toppings, friendly service .  Yes, I will return!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  They're pizza is so good.  Needed a quick bite the other night and it took less than 5 minutes to get a slice to go.  Very happy with everything."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite pizza spots! I've had a lot of things on the menu and have been very pleased!"}
{"text":"When I moved to the neighborhood 5 years ago I ordered a Meatball Hogie with extra sauce.When I unwrapped it at home lo and behold there was just a smidgen of sauce.

So five years later I give them a second chance.I order a Spagetti with a side of sausage.The container of marinara sauce was so small in proportion to the pasta that I could barely distinguish the flavor.And where is my side of sausage?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the pizza, and the price is the best part. They have the best deals on slices in all of the valley, you just can't beat it. The slices are delicious and good sized. The atmosphere is pretty relaxed and comfortable. I love the pizza but do yourself a favor and pass on the boneless wings, I haven't tried bone in so give those a shot! 5 star pizza, 5 atmosphere, 5 star service, and some decent wings!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this for my delivery place.  The food is very yummy and the delivery is on time.  Lots of choices for delivery and accepts cards and/or cash and you can order online.  

The Blanco could use a bit more of the butter/garlic thing, but it is adequate.  I like the pizza okay, and it is definitely better than average, but i would probably put it more at a 3.5 than a 4.  However, you can make your own combination and one of these days I'm going to hit on the perfect combination, but so far, my favorite is pineapple and canadian bacon, don't hate me.

The Baked Ziti is amazing.  I also have to rate the appetizers high.  For fun when I dont' mind going over calories there is fried zuchini and for when I want to be healthy there cut veggies are lovely.  The antipasto salad is a winner!  

The one time I had to complain (forgotten ranch dressing for the fried zuchini) they handled it quite well.  So I am a satisfied and returning customer!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great!  My favorite is the chicken pesto pizza.  I had not tried a pesto pizza before, and omg...delish!!!  You can stop in for pizza by the slice for just a couple bucks, or order an entire pizza to your liking.  You can't go too wrong here!"}
{"text":"Venezia's pizzeria is a pizza joint that I found on Yelp and decided to try on a whim.  Usually we do take-n-bake from Papa Murphy's but I was in the mood for something new and less healthy so I ended up getting take-out from here. haha  

It was good.  Nothing spectacular but, pretty tasty.  It's a few miles from my house though so I probably won't go back.  I have discovered less healthy options in take-n-bake so, I'll probably stick with the easy and less expensive!

Won't see ya there."}
{"text":"Best Greek salad ever! The large can easily be split between two. Their house dressing is what makes it :)"}
{"text":"I was in Tempe for a business trip and found Venezia's by doing a quick search in the area. Overall, VERY impressed with prices and quality of food. I got a calzone so it took a bit longer to get than other customers getting pizza slices; however, it was totally worth it. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area to try!"}
{"text":"Love Venezia's, especially this location. All the workers are so kind and helpful. They seem to make it a priority to remember you by name. The pizza is great...and big. The lunch specials are such a great price!"}
{"text":"Great staff, great food!  Glad we are in the neighborhood!  We just moved here and are so blessed to have found this place!"}
{"text":"The pizza was great!!! Unfortunately, the french fries were terrible! They were dry, overcooked, and so hard that they were inedible. Yuck! Waste of money!"}
{"text":"I like Venezia's for lunch, the slices are huge the wings are some of the best, and you don't have to spend a lot!!   If you like NY style pizza your will enjoy Venezia's."}
{"text":"I was impressed from the beginning.  The ordering process was easy.  The lady who delivered was very sweet even offering to help me open the door with my hands full.  I have had many different wing sauces in my time, but theirs was by far the best Honey BBQ I have had. Will be ordering from there again!!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is the best I have ever had as well as their ranch! It's a bit on the pricey side, but it's the only pizza worth the price!"}
{"text":"Sitting here waiting for our food. Been 28 minutes. I know it's late but spaghetti and meatballs? A half hour?"}
{"text":"This place is SOOO GOOD. This is what NY crispy really feels like, it's not just thin, it's thin AND crispy and not burned!! So so good. And the place has great music, is clean. The slices are huugee"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. 

Their pizzas are amazing! They offer gluten-free, which is nice, and they have tons of other menu options, too. 

Personally, I want to do their meal challenge where you have to eat one of their GIANT pizzas in a certain amount of time, but I'm trying to keep my svelte figure...by eating only slightly unhealthy amounts of pizza. 

Because I eat a lot of Venezia's...a lot."}
{"text":"I stop here on my way home from work all because I wanted to try a new salad. I've heard a lot about this place. So far I like it.  It smells awesome inside. I had a antipasto salad. It is the best.  Ill be back for more. I had chicken added it really didn't need it.  The large is for 4 people. But very good. This is all i had so how much more can i say. It was very fresh. Dressing was very good. The staff were very friendly. Dont forget to tip. I look forward to having my friday lunch here.  Lots of food for the money."}
{"text":"Not really sure what the hype is about. I found the pizza here to be entirely mediocre. The deep fried zucchini was decent, albeit overpriced for the amount that you get, but it's pretty hard to screw something like that up. The pizza prices aren't bad though. If you're nearby it's maybe worth stopping by, but I wouldn't bother going out of your way to try this place."}
{"text":"Was there 2 days ago and I love pulling into AZ  & grabbing a slice of pizza.  OMGOSH check out their salads!!"}
{"text":"Tasty pizza mad yum
Wings are good and the cashiers are hotties. 10/10 -ign
Also pizza is a meme. And that makes this pizza even more delicious."}
{"text":"I'm from new York so I was skeptical, but it was definitely some of the better pizza I've had here in Arizona. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've had Vanezia's delivered a few times but this is the first time I stopped in and ate. I never felt rushed even though we asked a few questions about the menu and specials. It's not a relaxing environment to enjoy a meal, and it wasn't exactly tidy because so many people move through here and I'm sure it's impossible to clean up behind people in a rush, particularly families with messy kids, but the pizza and wings are phenomenal. I might stick to delivery for a more relaxed environment, but I'll keep eating here for sure!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Venezia's based on the reviews from other Yelp reviewers.  Apparently, these other reviewers have never had good pizza because this place was pretty ordinary."}
{"text":"Love it! The pizza here is so good. Wings are just as good too. It's always fresh and hot. Quick service. Lots of food for your money. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place all the time when I lived in tempe and I loved it. Staff was always friendly and everything just moved so smoothly. However, when my wife and I moved to chandler we started going to this store instead because it was closer. We've been 4 times and it either takes them an extra 20 minutes longer than they tell me, my order is wrong or they haven't started it when we come to pick it up. Last night when my wings were done incorrectly causing me to wait another 20 minutes additional that was the last straw. I'm sorry to say this but you have officially lost my business."}
{"text":"i love their lunch special!  you can get a huge slice, 6 wings and a drink for under 6$.  my favorite here are the wings - i get honey medium (its not on the menu, they have honey mild and honey hot, but they always make it for me) and they are really good.  the pizza is tasty - nice crust and just enough sauce.  they have lots of toppings to choose from as well.
the place is pretty small right now, but they're expanding next door.  it should make eating in a lot easier.  take out is simple too.  they have an online ordering system that is easy."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Always good and we consistently enjoyed Venezia after my son's basketball games.  Best thing crispy style pizza in Phoenix.   I would give 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Pizza was under cooked, this is the Ricotta! It looked like vomit on a slice. When you ask for a individual slice with toppings, they will cut corners to prevent making a whole pie. No apology from anyone just a here is your money back, with that type of customer service you will get a negative review"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a good times with friends. Counter service by very helpful team. Pizza by the slice. Any toppings. The crust has just the right amount of chewy and tear. The mix of sauces cheese and topping have a full flavor in every bite. The calzone has good flavor. The mix of cheese in the calzone could use more ricotta. 
Overall a great place with good flavors."}
{"text":"Ive got to say... Between their website that is ridiculous to navigate and the rudeness of Joel, this pizza place would not be seeing us again. Joel had absolutely no knowledge of their products and coupons that are one every single one of their boxes. This man not only lacked common knowledge but also respect for his customers. He argued with me over a stupid coupon code and then laughed when i became so frustrated that i told him to forget it. I went down and spoke with Matthew who took care of the entire issue. He was very kind and respectful and all the while Joel was being loud and obnoxious holding up the line just talking to 3 men at the register while the line was to the door. Joel has no business in an establishment such as this and they should definitly reconsider even contemplating promoting this individual to management. H will cost them money and customers. MATTHEW... thank you so much for your professionalism, respect, and dignity. It's because of you they are getting 4 stars not 2..."}
{"text":"Used to really like this place, but it definately seems to have gone way downhill. I went over to the slices picked the exact ones I wanted. Because i was on a time crunch. Sat there for 5 min waiting for them to get heated up. Only to have them tell me they sold the last piece of chicken..... it would be 7 min. It has been 20 min and still waiting.  For a small app and 4 slices was 20 bucks. I would have just got the 9.99xl cheese if I wanted to wait there for 30 min. But hey their offer for a free soda was a real attempt at keeping my service.....and I'm sure they could see I was upset that I had to wait for a whole new pizza to get made for 1 slice. I'll update on quality of food after I eat. I was told sorry for the wait, well I'm sorry for not returning."}
{"text":"I have had their pizza and wings many times and always loved . This is the first time I got a large \"margarita pizza \" but we were left desiring a little more than a pie with sauce ..a couple spots of cheese..6 pieces of basil and a few small slices of tomato's I paid extra for. This pizza reminded me of someone who only that a few ingredients left in the fridge and decided to use them before they opened more. 
I know they employee younger people so maybe the person who made the pizza had a teenager moment but not worth $15."}
{"text":"Venezia's is our go-to for pizza. We find the price fair for their combos, and as a New Yorker, I do see the resemblance to our famous pizza. You will find the pizza greasier than Slices brand, but it's nothing a couple of napkins can't fix.

For wings we always get the sweet red chili (bone in)
I consider the heat mild and it's pretty sweet and sticky. I also find these wings crispier than other flavors. They give you a lot of ranch for them but not a lot of vegetables. 1 container could easily go for two orders but the vegetable portion is more like half a serving.

I really enjoyed their White Slice one time but I can't remember what day it is on. I wish they just had all the slices they offered out everyday.

I'll tell you one thing though a lot of these pizza places claim that they are New York style pizza but I have yet to find a place that offers baked ziti pizza or Penne alla Vodka Pizza and even chicken Parmesan pizza. So if you know where I can get some message me!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pizza I've ever had. SO THERE. I was there on a business call, and decided last minute to grab lunch since it smelled so darn good. Although they were busy, the staff were great, worked fast, and were friendly. Lot's of seating, but it gets packed. My slice was quickly served, and although I'm a die-hard pepperoni gal, I tried the Pesto Chicken, and found it amazing. I'm sure all of the locations are the same great quality.  If my prayers are answered, they'd open a location in north Phoenix or Scottsdale..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times as well as ordered out and it's been good all around. Wings and pizza are their specialty and I stick to both. Always good."}
{"text":"Not to bad! It is hard to find good pizza in Phoenix/Tempe, but this was not bad.

The crust is very good and has that nice dough flavor.  The ends are just as edible, and fantastic dipped in ranch.The sauce was excellent. Plenty of cheese, but a little light on the toppings. Pizza was a little sloppy, which I don't mind, but it did required a knife and fork. They seem to have fantastic slice special that is super cheap: around 5 dollars, and they have a student special as well.

If this pizza was in any other town it would only get a 3 or 3.5 at best.

Thought it was kind of lame that they charge for ranch, especially when you are paying 17 dollars for a pizza. But no other drawbacks.

Plenty of places to sit.  They do deliver although they charge 2 dollars, and the lobby is littered with flat screen TV's for the football junkie.

Service was fine. Typical fast food type service. 

Overall we left full and satisfied! We will go back."}
{"text":"Love their pizza. Consistently amazing! Great choice of fresh toppings. My first choice for pizza!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and excellent food. Ask for their creamy Italian dressing. The best!"}
{"text":"Thought we'd try something new other than Papa Johns. I'm very pleased to say we will be ordering from here in the future. 

We were pretty skeptical whether or not we needed a large or extra large so we went to the XL Venezia supreme and hot wings. 

The tasting of the pizza and wings were exquisite! Not too much marinara and just enough cheese. Our order was expected 45 to an hour wait but we ended up waiting about 40 minutes. 

Very satisfied with our first experience."}
{"text":"This is an average pizza place. It is certainly better than Domino's or Pizza Hut, but for me the crust was way too tough and chewy and the toppings were not very flavorful. I did also try the mozzarella sticks though, which were actually probably some of the best mozzarella sticks I've had! Wings are also good. I'm willing to try again, the main thing that bothered me was the crust."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent...but the au jus dipping sauce for the sammie is The BOMB. Best restaurant au jus I have had in a long time!! Fried zucchini was also pretty tasty. Decent sit down pizza place."}
{"text":"Love their pizza and wings. Hate hate hate places that nickle and dime you to ruin an experience. If you order a half order of their wings you get one ranch cup. If you order a full order of wings, twice the amount of a half order,  you still get one order of ranch. But they will be happy to sell you a second ranch for the second half of your order for $0.45!! Why ruin a good thing over $0.90 for a couple ordering 2 orders of wings? If I didn't want a different flavor tonight I would have left to Native Bar and Grill down the street. I bet more than $0.90 of project fell to the floor in the kitchen tonight so I hope the don't have to close their doors for good."}
{"text":"Love their pizza.  Salads are great too.  Only place I will order.  Reminds me of back East.  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 dozen wings online on the way out of work...

Hit the front door at exactly 25 minutes, the estimated time the order would be ready.

Wings were hot and the seasoning, while I would prefer hotter, came in as a 100% buffalo wing sauce with appropriate heat.

The order was  respectably heavy for the number of wings ordered...the price for 2 dozen wings at $20 is a bit more than I am used to spending.

The snips of celery and carrot are barely recognized...c'mon, folks...the veggies are cheap.  As for the dressing, 2 ounces...really?

You are the closest location to home.  You are not, however, the least expensive of my options within a reasonable (1.5 mile) radius."}
{"text":"I'm a fan indeed! I work late and there is NOTHING around my job that stays open and who wants to waste their whole lunch time tracking down some place to eat!? Not this chick! So a few times a week a group of us order online for delivery! Yes, that's right I said we order online!! (I love places you can order online! So easy!! You know you placed the order right, blah blah .. you get it).  You can even pay with your CC online.  Here is the kicker.. their delivery area is freaking HUGE! I'm in Chandler and they are on the far side of Gilbert! Thank you V's for delivering to me! I am in love with the Stromboli! Mmmmm delish! I ventured out and got the boneless wings and not bad!! They have a little kick to them.. just perfect.  They have GREAT Ranch! Places with good homemade Ranch always get brownie points w/ me! Anyway.. this place has done me well so I am writing and hopefully do them well!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good.  Don't go there for wine or beer because the selection is poor. Order was ready quickly."}
{"text":"A favorite spot for us, because it's one of the few spots you can get pizza by the slice. Good NY style pizza - not great - and the staff is always friendly. Cold sandwiches are good and come with a fresh side salad."}
{"text":"I don't care if pizza is NY style (my favorite), Chicago etc...I just like pizza. I ordered delivery from here yesterday because had work done on the house so was stuck at home, and have been wanting to try it. I ordered a XL pepperoni pizza, antipasto salad and boneless wings. The wing flavor was ok, but the wings were really, really soggy - expected with delivery to a certain degree but not that much.  HIGHLY recommend ordering regular wings if you are getting take-out/delivery. The pizza was disappointing, I thought it had NOOO flavor and was light on the cheese. I am not rushing to eat the leftovers and that's not like me. The antipasto salad was decent, but I've had better. I definitely don't get the hype for this place. I would head to Rosati's (their antipasto salad is awesome) or Buono's if I was craving the same style pizza. I won't choose to order from here again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Az! Let's make sure everyone knows this! #BreakingBad


The service, the atmosphere, and the quality!!"}
{"text":"Love Venezias, but just had a terrible experience with a takeout order. Ordered online and the estimate was for it be ready at 7:30. Arrived on time and proceeded to wait until 8:00 for my order to be ready. Orders up to 520 were being called ahead of me and I was order number 491. I asked twice and 20 minutes into my wait I literally heard an employee ask staff to make one of my pizzas.
I received no apology or explanation.
EDIT: Just got home and I got the wrong order."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place and I'm so glad we did. The service was fast, the food was great, and the atmosphere was fun! You get a lot of food for a really great price. The breadsticks with cheese were amazing!! We left stuffed and still had a ton of food leftover without breaking the bank. I can't wait to go back!"}

{"text":"Wow this was first time here and wow it was worth it the food was delicious thank you I will be returning in the future I highly recommend this to anyone"}
{"text":"All in all, I personally won't be ordering delivery from here again. 

BUT, if you're a pizza fan, and certainly if you're a fan of the big slice pizza places I used to see at the malls, I'm guessing you'd really like this place. I'd just be sure to order and eat there! Here's why....

This was the first time I've ordered from here. And for full disclosure, I'm not a big pizza fan like I was in high school. Mostly because my tastes have somewhat changed and l haven't  found many that taste spectacular. 

But, the pictures people posted looked really good, and my house munchkin saw the chicken and fries and wanted that... so I ordered!

When the food arrived, it looked great! It was on time and my GrubHub guy even kept the Cannoli separate from the warm foods. I just wish it had tasted as great as it looks.

And to be clear, I don't ever expect delivery to be as good as eating it AT the restaurant. But, I also don't mind having to reheat or crisp up my delivery food as needed.

Having said that, here's the breakdown...

Munchkin's chicken and fries... The fries were super soggy, even for delivery! I tossed them in the toaster oven to see if I could crisp them up. Ten minutes later, they were more crisp.... but they were a weird chewy texture. So we decided to skip the fries.

I didn't have to reheat the chicken because then I'd just have to let it cool down for the 4-year-old! She liked that part, so she ate the just the chicken. I figured what the heck, a lot of restaurants don't do kids meals very well (even though they should!) 

The garlic bread... not bad, but nothing super special. I reheated it a bit in the toaster oven too. It coulda used some more garlic and seasoning, but we liked it well enough to eat most if it.

The pizza... I ordered one of their large slices with pepperoni, black olives and extra cheese. Im glad I ordered extra though, because it was the amount I get normally at the pizza place I usually call. 

The good part is, since I don't eat as much as I used to, there was enough there to fill me up, share with the munchkin, AND still have leftovers (in 4-year-old portion size) for breakfast. I had put it in the oven for a few minutes to reheat and remelt the cheese as well. 

This was by far the best part of what we ordered. And that makes sense... order piza from a pizza place right? But even that wasn't something I'd order again... unless I was in a hurry, was hungry for pizza, and could eat it fresh at the restaurant. 

And my thought is, regardless of your specialty, if you're not gonna cook the rest of it as well, then don't have it on the menu!! 

And finally, the Cannoli... not my kind of dessert maybe? The crust was a hard crunchy pastry and I hed expected something a little flakier and the filling, while not a bad flavor, had a gritty texture vs a smooth pudding or custard type thing. Again, it could just be me as this is the first time I've ever had it!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, wonderful customer service! There's always a large crowd there every time that I visit the ice cream shop next door so I decided to give the. A try. I stopped by for a lunch special and had no idea that the pizza slices were so huge! It had the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. The cashier was very nice and helpful. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"The ranch is crack and so is the pizza, if you get the dough crispy. Honestly, delivery is always quicker than quoted and they are on grubhub.com- how much more convenient is that. The pizza is always good for leftovers and is always a crowdpleaser. I've tried some other pizza places and this is my go-to for delivery. Every. Time."}
{"text":"Not a very good pizza. Chewy crust and the toppings looked like they have been sitting on my pizza overnight. The pizza literally looked like what my leftovers looked like in college. I didn't realize you could mess up a pizza."}
{"text":"Don't ever order from this location. Not only did they arrive late with my food (delivery) but it looks like they just threw all of my food in a bag and sent it on its way."}
{"text":"The cheesy garlic bread wasn't good, didn't have any cheese. The pizza was ok but the service was slow and not very friendly"}
{"text":"Awesome salad + pizza. Also love the people who answer the phone to take your to-go orders. Very pleasant. Service is great as well."}
{"text":"I love pizza.  I think it should be granted its own food group.  

I typically don't care for places that serve pizza by the slice, becuase it tends to appear old and dry.  A little scary.  Not so at Venezia's!  Their pies are hot and fresh from the oven, and they are HUGE!  They yield beautiful slices of NY style pizza, with just the right amount of cheese & sauce.  I have never seen a slice of pizza so big.  So of course I had to have two.

Dangerously becoming a new lunch favorite!"}
{"text":"Got a togo pizza from here a few nights ago.  1st time I ever tried their food or been in their restaurant.  The atmosphere was very good & my take home pizza was phenomenal.  I will be eating here more often!!!"}
{"text":"First experience, I wasn't particularly impressed. It's okay, plain and simple. It can be a bit greasy at times. I always get the pizza when I go there, I have no problem with it. It's not the best nor the worst I've ever had. 

The customer service is usually pretty quick, never had to wait more than a few minutes if there's a line."}
{"text":"We used to love coming to Venezias for a quick slice but over the past few months quality has seriously fallen off. Now this is a last resort for us and the question we ask ourselves is do we want old stale slices."}
{"text":"Solid NYC style pizza.  Not the best I've had but good for a lunch stop. Plus the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza EVER!  They have great specials and also serve beer which is always a plus!  Definitely recommend the party size pizza for your next football party."}
{"text":"Management at Venezia's urged me to give their business another shot. That was 8 months ago. I finally had the opportunity to give it another go.

The online ordering system was better than in the past. You can now pay online OR in store.  The staff was again phenomenal.  Nat (or Nate?) was friendly, accommodating and charismatic.  A great face for your front counter.

This time around, I ordered the fried zucchini and a thin-crust pepperoni, mushroom and black olive pizza with added fresh mozzarella and light sauce.  The crust was not as thin as expected...I felt it was a regular crust style. I will say, however, that the crust was chewy and flavorful, crisp in all the right places. The toppings were plentiful, and the light sauce just enough.  The cannoli was filled freshly on the spot. The shells were crispy and sweet, and the contents the perfect sweetness.

I really enjoyed this time around,  and I'm really glad that I gave Venezia's another chance. Thanks to Dominick and the other staff for convincing me to try other items for an updated review/assessment of their place. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"when i first came here I really loved this pie.  The extra larges are pretty awesome.  I have come to like thin crust more though so I am not as partial to this pie as i once was. It is kind of doughy.

Good pie though. If you suggested we go I would be up for it."}
{"text":"I love Venezia's so much. Two slice special with a drink was my bread and butter back in the day. Even though I moved awhile back, I still crave venezia's."}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches here! I know, not what you would expect from a Pie place but the pastrami is delish. I ordered a medium pie and wings last night and the pie as usual lived up to expectations. I did order the wings extra crispy and they fell well short of even regular crispy. It as like a wet Cheetos and that's not OK. Usually they do a good job on that but this time they fell short. Their consistency to provide a solid array of food keeps them atop my list in the area, just make sure you emphasize that you want your wings cooked a certain way."}
{"text":"I go there and I order a slice of combo pizza and I must've waited 25 minutes you think they were at lunchtime they would have the pizzas ready to to go I will never go there again, bad management!!!!"}
{"text":"amazing wings and awesome pizza-the combos are reasonable and my boyfriend and i are seriously considering accepting their \"party pizza challenge\""}
{"text":"Love their pizza, came here with my friends, hungry. Venezias has slow service but taste good. Place is nice and staff is friendly, sometimes inattentive."}
{"text":"I bought this pizza for my workers as a thank you for completing a special project that took 2-weeks, so we were all hungry! I was told by one of my guys that I must had ordered a speciality pizza, because it was not great, not bad, but not great. Next time I'll stick to the popular choices and have a better experience."}
{"text":"There are a lot of good pizza places in the Phoenix area, but Venezia's takes the \"pie\". There's more than just pizza on the menu. The wings are my favorite. I can't find any better wings around town. The daily specials are what do it for me. The price is affordable and you get your choice of combinations. Best place for a business lunch or even to hang with friends and watch the game. Overall Venezia's is my number one choice for pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone super late one evening. From the time the order was placed to the last bite -my family & I was beyond satisfied. They were very helpful, polite and considerate from start to end."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite pizza place in the east valley! Besides the fabulous food, the customer service is suburb. I must mention Bryson, as he resolved a technical issue which resulted in a double charge to my card. To no fault of Venezias, Bryson worked diligently to resolve the issue and returned my calls as he said he would."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch specials! You can get a pizza, salad, and drink for around $6. Good quality pizza too...no where near fast food. Service is usually pretty good - every once and a while they'll have an off day though. Wings come pretty saucy so make sure to order lite on the sauce if you don't want to be smothered in sauce."}
{"text":"Service was ok. Wasn't anything spectacular. If you come here for he food and the food alone, you'll love it. Don't expect much more. Service itself wasn't on par. I don't expect anything extraordinary from high school students working at the register. I'd say just work on making your customers feel a tad bit more welcome, that's all!

Food 4/5
Customer service 2/5
Cleanliness 3/5
Value 4/5"}
{"text":"I went in to Venezia's because I had a nail appt down the way. Trying to be \"healthy\", I ordered the Chicken Cesar salad. I got to my pedicure appt and began to chow down (I am on my lunch break, hence the multi-tasking) I noticed after one or two bites my chicken didn't taste right. So disappointed because I have minimal time, I called them back just to give them a heads up about their chicken and potentially save someone else from food poisoning ... The gentlemen told me how they prep the chicken so it couldn't be it that it was under cooked. He went on to look up the order, provided me a  full refund me and asked what I would like instead. I told him, one slice of pizza would suffice. Instead, he assured me he would fill my To-go order with food to equate to what I originally spent despite him comp-ing it. He asked how long I'd be and he would have it waiting for me. In today's society we hustle and bustle all day... Multitask and we are on our way... Although, it is customer service stories like these that make you take a moment and realize how rare they occur. I work out at LA fitness regularly but have never stopped in Venezia's until today... After a small gesture that truly goes a long way... I will always think of Venezia's for my pizza needs!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. A bit pricey which is why the 4 stars. So we save it for a special occasion. Yum"}
{"text":"2017/18  -after living near the gilbert location for a few years....their consistancy is impressive. They absolutely kill it everytime we go there. Hands down the best pizza and pizza slice deal anywhere. We recently ate our old venezias in east mesa and it was a $#*! Show! Unorganized and we never got our food.  I had to go up and reorder it. The new larger space still needs some fine tuning."}
{"text":"So, so good.  While I was initially put off that it didn't have the puffy crust I expect from \"New York Style\" pizza the flavors were SPOT on! The body of the pizza had a nice chew, cheese was stringy in the best way and the sauce was NOT sweet by has plenty of flavor.  Cheesy bread was super cheesy with great seasoning, and the BBQ chicken pizza slice was perfect.  We will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"I'm sure everyone has seen the insane number of 5 minute pizza places popping up all over the east valley.
Twice the price and half the flavor of your local favorite ......Venezias !
Don't bother......i did and it was blah and expensive!
Give me those jumbo slices anyday !! :)"}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza with excellent service by friendly staff. I had my pizza to go but looks like a great place for a quick slice for lunch or a casual dinner.

The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is while the pizza was good it was not mind blowing. The sauce for the pizza was the highlight in my opinion. It's an honest slice but at least the day I ordered I felt like the dough was a bit flat and didn't have enough structure to it (even for the style). 

In a smaller town this would have been 5 star pizza but there is some very stiff competition for best pizza in Phoenix Metro area and this just falls a little short of being top notch."}
{"text":"The pizza and service was great. I would totally go back to this place and eat everyday if I had the money. The best I have had in Arizona great customer service"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Best pizza in the Mesa area. We order for big party's and just for a pizza night at home. Love the pepperoni! My favorite wings are Golden something or another. They are a wonderful twist on honey mustard! Very friendly staff and kid friendly"}
{"text":"Just picked up a pie for dinner. While waiting I observed several \"kids\" working there coughing into their hands and touching their faces. Then right on to help the next customer without washing thier hands, and there was a hand sink right there. Gross. The pizza was just ok. I couldn't tell the difference from the onions on half, and the artichokes on the other half. Heard too much hope about the food."}
{"text":"I'm a little late on reviewing my experience with Veneizas due to how hectic the year has been, but now that I have the time, I'll say that I enjoyed it. Last month, I ordered two big slices with extra mozzarella, a sausage, onion, and pepper hero, and a slice of New York cheesecake and had it delivered via Grub Hub. Boy, did that satisfy my New York experience! The only thing I would have changed is the tomato sauce on the hero. There was a little more than I would have asked for, but, there's still more heroes for me to try."}
{"text":"Definitely, good quick pizza. Inexpensive and filling!! Much different than the thin crust I'm used to but I still feel there are plenty of other pizza places to enjoy!
I'm from Chicago, so I understand that everyone needs a different kind of pizza to keep them happy!"}
{"text":"First let me start with telling you I am a metro area native New Yorker.  My bar for what  I consider a good pizza is HIGH!

Today I got the lunch combo with wings and a slice.

A real NY joint would serve their wings with blue cheese dressing and NOT ranch.  LOL

The pizza in my opinion falls short of a good NYC pie like you find at Grimaldi's.  


However,  based on the numerous great reviews I would suggest trying this place to form your own opinion.  I will likely return but I will try a hero or sub.  (Sub, like hoagie is a NJ term.  Most NYers might say Grinder or Wedge)"}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings.  Subs and pasta are pretty good; not the best I've had, but I still order them.  It's close to my house so this in my regular food rotation.  I always order online and pick it up, so I can't say much about their service other than they've never screwed up my order and it's always been hot and ready when I got there.  

Definitely a hole in the wall joint, but if you live or work close by I would give it a try."}
{"text":"So good! I love pizza and this place is great. Sweet thin crust and lots of cheese and toppings. We got the Hawaiian and the pineapple was so juicy with lots of big pieces of ham. We also got the antipasto salad- huge rolls of salami and TONS of banana peppers. This was the best pizza I've had in a long time. And the price was great for what we got. Extra large specialty pizza, salad, and a 2 liter for around 30 bucks. I'll definitely be ordering from here again!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Order delivery from here once a week. $30 for large pizza, wings and delivery fee/tip. Online ordering is kind of a pain in the ass but whatever. Usually they arrive quicker than the eta"}
{"text":"25 minutes after placing my delivery order online, I received a call stating that they REFUSED to deliver my order. The order was placed at the location that their website added after I put in my address (and they have delivered to my address before) but today I was told that because of football they are too busy to deliver to me, telling me that I am outside the delivery area. They made no attempts to make amends of their error and stated that my only option was to change to a pick up order. I took my business elsewhere and so should you. Ridiculous behavior- terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"Woah! Now that is a slice of pizza! I met a friend for lunch yesterday at Venezia's and was happy I did. The place is great - small and quick. The pizza slice I got was HUGE and was not greasy which I have come to accept (unfortunately) with a lot of pizza in AZ. 

For a quick lunch you cannot beat this place. I'm going to be back for sure and maybe I'll try a sandwich next time. 

Overall: 
Price - excellent
Service - great
Food - very, very good!
Location - not far from the freeway and easy to find."}
{"text":"This is the absolute BEST pizza we've ever eaten. The Park Place pizza is to die for! They have a good in-house environment, but also deliver, so it's a win- win either way. If you like pizza GO HERE NOW! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"they delivered a half hour early - yay!  the pesto pizza was great  - 5 stars but the Margaretta pizza was disappointing."}
{"text":"People line up at this place like they never had Good Italian.........over rated IMAO!

Keep in mind that good food means little if the service is slow or the order is always wrong. Venizia's does have some tasty food no doubt but the wait time and goofed up orders are unacceptable. 
I was blessed to grow up in a little town off the Pacific coast that had a large Italian community and a Ristorante was never far away, not pasta mills but food that was more like you would get on Sunday at \"Nonna's\" house."}
{"text":"Big, greasy, messy, delicious pizza. Venezias has a nice, large dining room with a bunch of tvs and great food specials and lunch specials everyday. Two huge slices and a drink for five bucks? Best deal in town. Nothing rewards your hard workout next door at LA Fitness quite like heaping gobs of mozzarella... you are seriously missing out if you haven't been here."}
{"text":"Not too thick, not too thin, good ingredients and the pizza sauce is tangy and flavorful. The hot wings are good too - not totally drenched so you can still taste both the chicken and the sauce. Delivery was on time and prices are reasonably cheap. I will definetly order from them again!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here a lot for their lunch specials. I happened upon it one day when my other pizza spot was closed. Haven't been to that place since!
Their slices are huge! Their pizza is amazing and the place is family run. They have numerous locations in the valley and I am glad one is right down the street from me. Their prices are a little high as well.
I would say the downside is the high school kids that frequent the place. They can be loud and sit in the back room. 
I also once ordered 4 slices and got the wrong ones and didn't realize till I was home. So check before you leave. 
Otherwise, this place is great and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place has the greatest sauce in the valley. Seriously, its awesome. Excellent if you just want to stop in and grab a slice or get a party pie (2 or 3 feet across, gigantic!) delivered to your home. They also make Sicilian pies! That is amazing in the valley, no one has Sicillian! 

Their sandwiches are also great, at least the hot ones. The cold ones suffer from the problem that all cold sandwiches in the valley suffer. We just can't seem to get ham, roast beef and turkey right here in AZ. Its weird, seems easy, but there's just something off with the cold cuts in the valley. 

The staff is rather young and not very experienced. There is a lot of turnover. So there are issues where you ask for a meatball parmigiana sandwich and are told that there isn't one...you have to tell them that a meatball sub and and a meatball parmigiana sandwich are the same thing.

As an east coaster I always have to remember to not order subs as heroes, as then I have to argue what is on my gyro. Because gyro is pronounced (by Greeks at diners as well) in NY with a hard 'g', largely IMHO because subs are called heroes. 

Nonetheless, their delivery is great and the food is excellent! Their chicken parmigiana sub is a runner up for best in AZ!"}
{"text":"I was going to give 4 stars, then remembered the time that we got delivery and they forgot a pasta sauce.  I called and let them know the mistake and we had the pasta sauce in like 5 minutes, and they comped the dish.  

Very solid pizza!  The Italian Stallion is usually our go to, and surprisingly spicy!  We have also used Venezia's for kids birthday parties, you can get massive pizzas that will feed a bunch of people for pretty reasonable prices.  They also have great salads, we usually get the greek.   

The reason I was going to give them 4 stars is that they are somewhat pricey, but there are coupons out there and you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Great place for delivery...pizza was good wings were good. Would get it delivered again"}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza place now that I no longer live close to NYPD.  And they have awesome fried zucchini! If you like NY style pizza, go here!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is really good! There was four of us, so we got the largest pizza they had with pepperoni and sausage! The pizza crust was thin and flimsy- just the way I like it! I was able to eat three slices. When I come back to Mesa, I'll definitely come back here! Once you find a good pizzeria, you stick with it!"}
{"text":"Love love love this pizza! Legit and relatively cheap! Delivers fast and hot. Loved the green chili's BTW."}
{"text":"Theres not much to say about this place. I live less than a half mile away and they deliver fairly quickly, so it's definitely my choice over pizza hut and dominos. I wouldn't go as far as to say the food is amazing or anything, but it's great for pizza cravings in a pinch."}
{"text":"I've had their pizza on several occasions but this was the first time I visited the restaurant. I came with a few coworkers and we ordered from the slice specials. I got one slice and a salad, \"upgraded\" to Caesar for an extra $1 and a drink. Food was prepared fairly quickly and it was filling and tasty. Slices are very large so order accordingly, and you can customize toppings. Typical soft drinks but I also half noticed they have iced teas as well. Totally forgot about their connection to Breaking Bad until I saw the actors' photographs on the wall, classic. 

There's lots of places to sit even during a busy lunch hour. It's a good place for a fast meal and there is some variety of sides and such. I'd be back, there's also a location closer to home."}
{"text":"Pretty much the most New York pizza you can have without being from New York. Ohio pizza has nothing on Venezia's and no other place in Arizona (so far)."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for a gluten free pizza, the cashier maddie was extremely helpful and patient while we were deciding what we wanted on our pizza. 

One of the pizza makers, Ethan, brought our pizza  out and he was very friendly and enthusiastic about where he works. The gluten free pizza didn't taste any different from a regular pizza, it was delicious. 

It's a little bit pricey there but definitely worth it, you can tell they use quality ingredients. Ethan also mentioned the coffee that the owners make, I'll have to give it a try next time!"}
{"text":"I had a 12 inch mushroom pizza with the girl. I actually hated it. It was not burned but seemed kind of tough. The dough just was tasteless like cardboard. The sauce did nothing for me. I can't remember the last time I had pizza and disliked my meal. Maybe it's cause I had it with water. Because they only have Pepsi."}
{"text":"They have Pepsi so we ordered delivery. Unfortunately by the time we got it the pizza WAS COLD and the cheese had started to harden. No big deal we popped it in the over for two minutes and got the crust crispy again. The problem is I just don't like the flavor. I don't like it cold or reheated. I don't love the sauce and cheese they use. And the crust while we ordered thin was thickish. As someone who grew up in New York I feel like I can be critical. This is not authentic my style that I grew up eating. It's similar to all the bad my pizza I get in Arizona"}
{"text":"I don't know why anyone would ever use Domino's after eating a slice of Venezia's! Their sauce is out of this world and so tasty, as is their crust. You can tell they make it by hand everyday.

And their lunch specials (and they also have daily specials) are just the right size. I had a slice of pizza and a small salad for less than $7.00.

The Tempe location is large inside, but around lunchtime it is really busy! We got one of the last tables. Venezia's is a definite must for pizza in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Their webpage lists the Ray/Cooper location as covering the Gilbert, AZ area, including our address, yet when we call to order they refused to take said order saying they don't accommodate this address. That's fine if they don't cover the area we're in but then they shouldn't list it on their webpage. Extremely poor customer service."}
{"text":"We have always loved Venezias Pizza.  We enjoyed their pies in NM and when we moved to AZ we were happy to see that we could still enjoy their pies.

The pies are AWESOME!  Great all the way around no matter your combination of toppings.

Visit their website and order online - pickup and enjoy.  You can also enjoy the family atmosphere and dine-in."}
{"text":"I've been to this location as well as the Tempe location. Great spot for lunch during the work week or just a quick bite. Being fairly new to AZ, this place was recommended to me by a few people at work. I'm glad that I listened. Quick service and great pizza. The slice of pizza & salad special is definitely enough to fill you up."}
{"text":"As a fan of pizza!! I could say that this place have the best pizza I've ever tasted before.
You can imagine that you are in New York.
Feel sorry for dominos and Pizza Hut now:((
I highly recommend it also they have a delivery service though. Enjoy guys!!"}
{"text":"While traveling for work, I didn't want to go out.  Relaxing with a nice slice was on my agenda.  Venezia'a did not disappoint.  I ordered the veggie pizza and hot BBQ wings which arrived fairly quick, still hot and good. Thanks, Jeremy...the chocolate cake was great! Moist and chocolaty."}
{"text":"I've given up finding the best pizza in town because, quite frankly, sometimes I'm in the mood for fold-it-in-half NY style pizza and other times I crave something more refined. Venezia's does NY style right, with a consistency that has yet to disappoint.

The menu offers a nice variety, touting the usual toppings and pizza variations (calzones, stromboli, etc.). Add to that tasty salads, wings, and sandwiches made with Boarshead meats.

Their combo specials make Venezia's an affordable lunch option. For the carnivores, go on Wednesdays to try out my personal favorite, the Italian Stallion. Otherwise, the Greek salad is also delicious. 

The fountain and tea offerings are abundant. TVs are tuned in to sports channels. The staff is friendly and the seating is generous:  booths and tables with a handful of larger booths for parties of 4+. Lunch is busy, but I've never found myself without a place to sit. Venezia's is situated in a strip mall with limited seating outside and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I seen mixed reviews before I ordered from here. I'm not sure what the other people are complaining so much about. I ordered delivery and the pizza and garlic cheesey bread was soooo delicious! The nice smoked bacon, the candaian bacon and hamburger. The crust has a nice chew and crunch to it. The home made red sauce is out of this world (delicious!!!). I think I finally found my go to pizza place. I will definitely recommend you guys to people I know! Not over priced either."}
{"text":"This place get's 5 stars not just because you can get Pizza by the slice ANYTIME.. but it's the best Pizza I've had in the Valley! I had a slice of the Chicken Pesto & the BBQ Chicken. It's just perfect pizza and huge slices! Plus the combos are great & cheap."}
{"text":"Pizza is a very personal thing, and of course battles have been waged upon regional crust preferences.  I think that when in the Valley, Venezias is a terrific option with pies based on the \"crusty chewey\" thinnish-but-not-thin style crust.  It's a local chain with 5 or 6 locations spread ideally across the Phoenix area.  My other local fave is the national NYC/Brooklyn franchise in Old Town Scottsdale.

PROS:  Crust, amazing marinara sauce, fresh toppings from bougie to basic.  The pepperoni is not your usual fatty, salty glop.  The white sauce is also very, very good with fresh ricotta and spinach on the basic pie.

CONS:  Tables but no table service.  Questionable music taste."}
{"text":"I can't even express the goodness of this place the food is great the staff is always so nice. I'm never disappointed and it's always a fun time. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I sure miss living in an area where Dominic has set up shop. This Pizza is fantastic..!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Usually our go to spot for Sunday football. Everything is great, especially the golden medium boneless wings. They need to sell the golden medium sauce by the bottle."}
{"text":"I've eaten here probably 20+ times. It's honestly the only place that hasn't went out of business in the area, but for good reason. Real nice food, pizza by the slice, and good prices. They make the LARGEST pizza ever. Check it out. The only knock on the place, for me, is all the times I've been there, I ALWAYS get a wierd vibe from the staff. They don't seem very friendly. It's not that they are mean, they're just not nice. Does that make sense? I guess I just always feel like they don't like their jobs, and it shows. 
The food I can definately recommend. You should check it out for the pizza for sure."}
{"text":"Can't recommend this location anymore. We used to be regulars until my hubby pulled out a large hair. We were so disgusted that we skip going to this location for at least six months. Today we got lunch to go and come home to find a huge hair swimming in the wing sauce. Done! Disgusting."}
{"text":"I had the big New York  size Hawaiian as well as the buffalo chicken pizza. Damn good pizza. Bought the house made ranch dressing which added to the bliss we experienced. Wings were solid and tasty. This is my spot here now."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had since I moved out here from Philly. Huge slices and so many options!! I am dying to try their Mac and cheese bites but I am always so full on pizza!! Their deals and service are really fantastic. Highly recommend! My favorite lunch!"}
{"text":"Had the boneless wings this time around. Mild and honey BBQ split (amzing) - truly tasty. Loved it and of course still the best NYC style pizza in the valley.  Fold over gewey-cheezy, greasy goodness.  Do not go here if you are looking for something healthy ... go here to get full on bad for you food!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Initially had one star because the server misinformed me on their specials and prices and since moved it up to 4 stars because the owner was responsive and followed up. Thank you"}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes to get my slice of pizza. It wasn't that busy so I think the server probably just forgot my order. Pizza tasted ok, not the best I've had, and not the worst. The wait was a little disappointing however."}
{"text":"This has become our new favorite pizza place!  Best pizza around!  We usually take it home but have eaten there several times. They are always busy and the staff is great!! They have a HUGE party pizza which is great for family get togethers!  Their medium pizza is the size of a large!  Their fried zucchini is amazing and so are the salads!  And best of all....they serve PEPSI!! Best combo with pizza!!"}
{"text":"Venezia's is great! I finally got a chance to try them the other day. My husband and I both went for our \"date night.\" We both got one of their combinations, with a slice of pizza, six wings and a drink. Their slices are HUGE! It was a very yummy meal for both of us.

My only comment is that the restaurant is a little dark. I would have liked more lighting. It could have just been the cloud coverage. But I will definitely be back! Good stuff!"}
{"text":"We got the party size and 2 slices of the Chicken pesto. All the food was great and filling. My kids were done after only a slice each."}
{"text":"Worst pizza both my husband and I felt sick after eating it!! All the toppings fell off and it arrived cold!  We called for them to come an pick it back up and the manager wanted to give us another crappy pizza!  Never order from them!!  Tasted rancid!!  I wish their were a negative rating. And by the way word of mouth is everything!"}
{"text":"Darn, what happened to this place? This used to be our go-to place as its right down the street. The pizza was top notch, full of toppings with stellar crust. We haven't ordered pizza in ages so we were looking forward to this. The pizza was pretty flat (can't think of a better word)--crust was limp, cheese seemed cheap, and the toppings were so scarce I forgot we ordered onions! And cmon, a few shavings of meatballs do not equate a meatball pizza. The sauce was still nice and tangy, but the rest was pretty meh. Wings were pale and soggy but at least they were big. The Mac and cheese bites saved the whole order--little nuggets of joy. Please don't change those. I felt the price of the meal was insulting for what we got. Their pizza is quite expensive, but used to be worth it. Quit skimping on the toppings and quality and maybe we will order again. What a shame!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here. It's my go-to place for NY style pizza in the SE Valley. I used to be a Casanova Bros loyalist, but after a couple of not so good experiences there, I flipped to Venezia's and haven't looked back. 

Unlike some previous posters, I've never had an issue with the service and have always found it efficient and friendly. Also, I've never had anything here but the pizza, so I can't comment on any of the other menu items. 

For first timers, you can dine-in and buy slice combos so you don't have to commit to anything large right away. Once you're ready for a full pie, you'll be glad to know that they run daily specials which you can find on their website and they're always issuing coupons in those junk mailings you get. You'll find them once you get through all of the blinds and garage door service flyers.

If you've seen Breaking Bad, you'll know that it's had some sad moments. Like when Jesse's girlfriend OD'd or when the young boy gets shot. For me, one of the saddest episodes was when Walter got mad and tossed that delicious Venezia's pizza on to the roof of his house and it went to waste. I wish I could've been there to intercept it."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  My favorite!  The supreme is particularly yummy. Don't forget to get the bread sticks with cheese. Delicious!  I could just eat that. Also the antipasto salad is the best around.   The service is great and they are always friendly. Tried delivery for a party. They came exactly at the time requested with no issues."}
{"text":"Customer service was great. Pizza was exactly what i was looking for. They sell pizza by the slice or whole. Flavors were good. Huge slices (one was plenty for me). The crust is crispy and thin. It is a New York style type pizza so if u are looking for a thicker or heartier pizza i dont think this is it. I will go back not only for the pizza but for the ice cream shop thats next door that was great as well."}
{"text":"Hi. My name is Omar and I am an addict. I'm addicted to Venenzia's Pizza. No, I don't want help to fix my problem. I just can't get enough of this pizza!!!
I've ordered large lunches here twice. My team and I love 
the ITALIAN STALLION, BBQ CHICKEN, MEAT LOVER, SPICY HAWAIIAN PIZZA, MARGHERITA, SUPREME and my fav:  THE PARK AVENUE. It has artichoke hearts, spinach, garlic, tomato and grilled chicken.  
OMG! Freakin Awesome.  Disclaimer: It's a little wet so expect some funky sounds eating it. 
You can't eat one slice.  Really.  You can't. 
I am never disappointed.  My doctor is though...at my lack of self control...then i remind him I'm addicted...it's all good."}
{"text":"WE love getting the party pizza. It is so big and they really do a great job. The  jalepenos are so spicy , which makes a fantastic pizza! I have been in for pick up and had delievry several times with out a hitch. One time they forgot our ranch but quickly brought it to us which we appreciated so much. Great customer service and overall fantastic foods of fairly good quality."}

{"text":"Best Pizza, wings, and antipasto salad in Arizona!
The wings are as good as my favorite place in Buffalo NY where I am from!  I know wings and pizza, this is excellent!
Thank you Venezia's!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty alright. It's really big. Had the Bruschetta pizza it was good. Not a fan of the crust though."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is phenomenal.  Super fast, tasty and inexpensive.  They have slices of the day as well!  Today was buffalo chicken!

Typically by the slice restaurants sell you pizza that, while delicious, is almost always a little dried out and old.

This place is fresh with every slice!"}
{"text":"Feeling a bit sluggish one night during vacation, Lisa H and I decided to order from a local pizza joint.  After searching Yelp reviews of places near our hotel, Venezia's seemed to be the place to check out.

Venezia's online menu was nice and comprehensive.  A lot of the pizzas looked really tempting, but we opted for the simple, large one topping pizza (pepperoni), so we could take advantage of the Yelper discount that was available.  We also got an order of the family-size breadsticks.

Venezia gets big points for having an online ordering form!  Nicely done!

But they lose a few points for taking over an hour to deliver to just a few miles away.  Yes, yes, I realize they're probably consistently hoppin', but 60 minutes to get my foodstuffs was a little longer than I'd normally be willing to wait for pizza.

That being said, the pizza and breadsticks did arrive warm, despite the long wait.  Everything was really tasty, definitely some good pizza here!  I was a big fan of the crust.  Just thick enough not to be obnoxious.  And obviously still foldable to be considered NY style, right?  The breadsticks were also quite delicious.  But for two people, the amount that we ordered ended up being way too much!  I guess that's better than not enough.

Overall, if I lived in the area, I'd probably be back to check out more of Venezia's menu.  Good eats at a decent price, for sure."}
{"text":"The pizza crust is good! But the Margherita was lacking in flavor and the white pizza was way too salty."}
{"text":"Awful,dried out, rubbery.  Tried this as smart shoppers deal of the day.  Won't be coming back anytime soon.  Little Cesars is better and that's not saying much."}
{"text":"I'm a NY native, and lived in north Jersey for over 15 years. This is legit as it gets. Definitely one of my vices."}
{"text":"Love this pizza!  Huge slices with yummy toppings!  Try the chicken pesto... It will not disappoint. They also have a HUGE family size pizza available. It is awesome!"}
{"text":"Venezia's is almost a weekly thing for our family!  Great pizza and pretty reasonably priced. I love their specials. Most places only have lunch specials and only on weekdays. Venezia's specials are always available and always a good choice!"}
{"text":"Yum! Portions here are huge. I've never actually ordered an entire pizza. I usually the slice and boneless buffalo wing combo. Good eating and a fair price."}
{"text":"Have to up this to 4, we eat there too much.  The best pizza ever?  Certainly not.  Do I like the conveyor belt instead of the pizza oven?  No sir.  But when we need a quick slice this is where we go.  

If it is time to get a full pie, that is what Spinato's is for.  But for a quick slice?  This can't be beat.  Tried hitting up a few places in Mesa to find them a complete dud.  I always leave full and satisfied here.  Always quick to take the order and get you the food.  Place is always PACKED.  

After another 20-30 visits I may swallow my NJ pride and give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"We have been getting pizza here for about the last 10 years. I can't say I have never had an issue, but the food has always been good and the service is good too, surprising given that I think 90% of their staff are part time high school and college students.

Fair warning there can be long waits on Friday nights or during big events but their estimates are generally good."}
{"text":"While Venezia's has fantastic pizza, and they are one of the few places to carry canadian bacon as a topping choice, this particularl location has a regrettable tendency to screw up orders.  It has happened to me a total of nine times.  So I recommend that if you order, particularly if it is online, make sure you confirm your order by calling them AND opening your pizza before you leave the place."}
{"text":"Our friend from Sweden came to visit us. Most of the food sizes in Europe and surrounding are much smaller than the US. Our medium drink sizes in Sweden would be their large or even extra large.
Anyway, I figured I would pull a prank on him and I ordered the 24\" party pizza. I brought it home and set it on the table. I told him his medium pizza was here. I had him believing for about an hour that was the US version of our medium size. Good laughs.
Anyway, the pizza was decent, the sauce was good but rather sparse as it is with most places. It was baked perfect. The staff was nice and polite and helpful.

I am used to eating some pretty darn good, and I dont mean these new designer pizzas either, real pies... Chicago, N.Y., San Francisco, Columbus, Philadelphia so it is fairly hard to impress me.

I might come back in a pinch but have yet to find a killer pie here in PHX."}
{"text":"Being a NY'er it probably isnt fair for me to write a review but they call themselves New York pizza. They are not. Very skimpy on the toppings. The crust is nothing like a ny pizza. The best thing about the place was the service which is why I gave it 3 instead of 2 stars. NY'ers skip this place"}
{"text":"I can't believe I hadn't heard of this place before.  I've gone 3 or 4 times now, and it's been consistently good.  Standard lunch price for a pizza place, good greasy pizza, and I enjoyed the boneless wings.  Next step is for me to become the FourSquare mayor, 'cause I'm all Web 2.0 and stuff."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how bad the pizza was. I've seen yelp give good reviews to pizza places before that I wasn't wild about but those places weren't bad they just weren't great. This one is an exception. I went in for 2 slices. The first being a white sauce slice...now I'm not exaggerating, I literally had to smell my shirt and arm to make sure I wasn't losing my sense of smell. I couldn't really taste anything I mean it had sliced tomatoes on it and I couldn't real even taste them. It was mega bland, like a white rice and unflavored chicken kinda bland. But I was like well maybe white sauce just isn't their thing.

So I bite my pepperoni slice and I'm like ah I didn't lose my sense of smell. The second slice was like flavor country after such a bland slice. But then I was like man this is kinda dry, the cheese also does not have much flavor, pepperonis are kinda meh. Does this even have pizza sauce? 

I went to this place starving it should have been great, even with a heightened sense of smell and taste it was bland and dry. I don't even want to imagine what it's like in a semi fed state. 

Little Cesar's is average to me. This isn't even as good as that. Why spend 5 bucks on this when I can get a whole pizza for the same price that actually tastes better? Can't speak for the rest of the menu but the pizza is really sub par. Can't understand the high marks it has. Maybe it's better as a fresh whole pizza? Maybe?"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Venezia's for years. To me, it's the best pizza in the area. It's so good I just order plain cheese most of the time because it doesn't even need extras, in my opinion, which says a lot. I'm usually a \"supreme\" kind of gal. After suggesting to my boss at work to give them a try, now any time they order pizza for us, it's got to be Venezia's huge party pizzas! The sauce is not too sweet, not too acidic, and the cheese has a really good flavor that goes with the yummy crust. The crust is tasty too! For desert I love their cheesecake with added strawberries. The salads are fresh and interesting. I'm not much of a sald eater but their salads aren't boring.Try their fried zucchini with honey mustard!
The one thing I'm not a fan of is their spaghetti... but they are my default pizza place for sure!"}
{"text":"Best Gluten-Free Pizza that can be delivered. I've tried my share of delivery GF pizza's and they've been awful. So it was nice to try something finally edible. Down side- super tiny pizza for way too much money. For reference my almost 3 year old, tiny, picky eater ate half the pizza and shared the rest with his 1yr old sister. Yeah. There are a couple other places with superior GF pizza actually worth the price and bigger but they don't deliver, so this will do in a pinch if you don't mind paying an arm and a leg. 
I ordered a gluten-free cheese pizza and a protein bowl- both came out to $30- insane right. A lot of tacked on fees but whatever I was desperate. FYI- I tried using the coupons from an ad and from yelp but neither worked so your better off calling it in rather than using the app if you want the ad discount."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place, yet!

I used to come here at least twice a week, back in 2003 when I used to live in Maricopa and in 2004 when I finally moved to Chandler.  Venezia's Pizzeria was nearby the Chandler-Gilbert Community College (cool academic institution, IMO) I attended at that time.  I remember grabbing a $1 side salad at McDonald's and then heading over to Venezia's for a slice of crispy thin-crust cheeze pizza w/ spinach... those were the days!  :)  I really thought I'd reviewed this place, but this could've been pre-Yelp and during my Citysearch phase...

Finally had a reason to stop at Venezia's for dinner a little less than three weeks ago, so I decided I'd try a whole order of white pizza, no sauce.  While good on its own, this pizza came to life w/ many dashes of roasted red pepper flakes, oregano, and parmesan cheese.  The thin-crust didn't fare so well- it was soggy before you could say \"cheese\" (pardon the pun!), but I managed.  

Too bad this pizzeria doesn't serve wine... I urgently felt the need to balance out the grease w/ a glass of wine, so my next stop was an Irish pub on Boston and Arizona..."}
{"text":"This is our go to pizza bevsuse its close and we're never disappointed. The lunch special is great & cheap. 2 of my favorite things. The staff is courteous & quick. Why not 5 stars? Because all pizza is compared to Mama Mia's."}
{"text":"Their pizza is pricey though it tastes good.   Never had an issue before but what upset me is....calling at 10:50 and being told one hour for delivery.  That's fine but when noon hits still no food.  At 12:10 I call and was placed on hold twice and was just told he is on his way.   It finally came at 12:25.  35 minutes late with no apology.  By then (I'm a teacher) my lunch hour was over and I can't eat when I'm teaching.  Next time I will avoid delivery or order from Bella's Pizza across the street."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for pizza and salad. The Greek salad is bomb and pizza is always tasty. luckily I live nearby but if I didn't I'd still order."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!!!!! I ordered a small bacon and ham pizza and almost ate the entire thing myself and it's a good size!! Delivery arrived much sooner than expected!!"}
{"text":"Awesome tasting pizza! The crust and the tomato base sauce was very good along with the slice sausages!!  Service was quick!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through DoorDash from this place on Sunday at around 8:10 pm, delivery estimate said it would be delivered around 9:21 pm. That was no problem since we weren't in any rush to eat. It was a fairly expensive order, over $50 for 2 small pizzas and a salad. Our delivery driver was waiting to pick up our order for over 45 minutes, he called us a couple times to let us know that the restaurant was running behind on our order. After he waited over 30 minutes they let him know that they had sent out our order with their delivery driver instead and they had to completely remake our order and we would have to continue to wait. Thankfully our DoorDash driver kept us updated throughout the whole process and it was clearly a complete fail on Venezia's end. Venezias told the driver that they took $10 off our bill but I still have yet to see that change made on my bank statement. The pizza is good but definitely not worth the expensive price tag and the hassle it took to get our order, I felt horrible for our poor delivery driver. We'll see if that $10 reduction ever comes through but I kind of doubt it will. If you like super slow pizza for an expensive price this place is for you, if not, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Do not order delivery from this place. They took down the wrong address and came VERY late. The food was ok."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Full set of spices, etc. on every table - I really like that in a pizza place. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place by far is the BEST big pizza by the slice you can get in AZ.

Now don't come comparing it to some gourmet pizza, oven baked, organic or whatever people are getting into these days!! This is just a big AMERICAN pizza that is greasy and good. I say American is because have you guys seen a real Italian pizza?? Then you'll know.

I can walk in get 2 slices of pizza and a drink for around 6 bucks. I usually will try to make atleast 5 to 10 trips a month here just to satisfy my pizza craving."}
{"text":"I am leaning toward 4 stars just because it's Tempe where good pizza doesn't exist. This is actually quite good for carry out it delivery pizza. Don't get ricotta as a topping with sauce as it gets too soggy but I imagine the white pizza is ok. They should improve the deserts. The decadent chocolate cake tastes like its hyper processed. But the pizza is solid and it doesn't take long for delivery. It has become a delivery staple, especially in a Tempe where most delivery places are really bad."}
{"text":"Got calzones tonight and was supremely disappointed. More bread than anything else and not the right kind of bread for a calzone. Barely any Italian sausage inside. Definitely not worth the money or time. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, and even better service!!  Having a party or have a family to feed?  The Party pizza is unbelievably huge and delish!  We just had three of them for a party with 20 adults and 14 kids and we have about 1/4 of one pizza left over.  Staff was super friendly and accommodating. Love this place..."}
{"text":"Very good pizza! I asked for extra mushrooms and they are the only ones I know that actually take it by heart. They covered the whole slice with mushrooms! Low prices and friendly staff."}
{"text":"really good crust on the pizza and delivery within the hour online ordering system is easy will definitely order from them again"}
{"text":"Excellent NY-style pizza and our best meal in Phoenix so far. We ordered cheese and margarita slices. The crust is really good and the cheese and sauce are perfect. It reminds me of the better slices back home in Jersey. It has a nice family pizzeria ambiance inside (pleasantly dark) and a large string of lights outside."}
{"text":"We've been to this pizza place a couple of times now. They have delicious pizza, a kind staff (who ended up saving us some money by recommending a whole fresh pie instead of a bunch of slices)(just like in Miracle on 34th Street), and a nice, roomy eating area (which is getting kind of rare at casual pizza places)."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this pizza place and it was great that they also delivered to the Resort. Unfortunately on this day the freeway had a shut down and it took about 90 minutes to get our pizza and it was definitely cold . The driver was nice and I know it wasn't his fault so still tipped well. He also called when he was 10 min away. Didn't bring plates or cheese, Peppers.  I would give them another try , Pizza was good but could have been great if hot !"}
{"text":"Pizza was very good. It was not over nor undercooked; just perfect. It had good taste and was prepared with quality products. The wings were good. They were well seasoned. The cheese sticks were also very good. My order for pick up was on time and they provided quick and easy service. The restaurant was busy on a Friday evening at 6pm.  Parking was readily available."}
{"text":"Seriously, freaking AMAZING. My husband and I can't get enough. Since finally trying this place about two months ago we've been there once, maybe twice a week. The antipasto salad is AMAZING, and the Italian dressing is addictive- one of the ONLY places my picky, non salad eating, vinegar hating husband will actually say, \"I want that salad, extra Italian!\". Just tried a veggie pizza bowl tonight and now I'm even more hooked! Recommend Venezias highly and can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"Good place for pizza, perhaps one of the best in the area. Great slice/combo specials. A slice, 6 wings, and a drink is more than enough to fill me up. The pizza is good, the staff are friendly, and even the wings are good. 

I like to get the slice combos, but they don't really bake the toppings into the pizza, so they kind of fall off (unless the pizza was already cooked with the toppings). Otherwise, the crust, sauce, and cheese are all very good.

The wings are pretty amazing as well. I like honey hot is weird, its like hot but just honey on top, and its very watery, which makes the wings soggy. Weird. The mustard hot and hot are pretty good complements to a slice of pizza.

I did the party pizza challenge with a friend. Its a little tough, about 10 slices per person, but definitely doable. We weren't on drugs when we did it like some other people were, who somehow happened to finish it in 5-10 minutes. Ie, at the Tempe location, two sorority looking girls did it in 15 (they probably weighed no more than 200 lbs combined). Meanwhile, my friend and I, weighing in around 350 lbs did it in 35 minutes. Am I whining about a food contest? No, just don't try this expecting to get it done.

This place has been pretty consistent the few times I've been there. I appreciate that. I hate it when a place is awesome the first two or three times, then it drops off in quality and can be a coin flip every time you go. So far its been very consistent.

They stay well connected with their patrons on FB/twitter. I won a free slice through a contest. Free stuff is always cool. It shows that they appreciate us.

Ahh the raiting. This was close. I can't think of anything particularly special about this place. The pizza isn't special, the wings aren't special, and I haven't tried much else. However, I wouldn't hesitate to come here ever, and there are times when I get cravings for this place. There isn't much in Tempe that is close to this sorta stuff. My baby brother loves this place as well, and so does my GF. I'm sure they'll never say no if I wanted to come here, so I think that means this place deserves a 5."}
{"text":"NY style?  Not so much.  NY style means large, thin slices of pizza that you have to fold to eat.  I didn't really find any of this when we ordered a large pizza to go.  The dough was too thick, and it ended up tasting like a regular style pizza you can get anywhere.  Sure, I'm not expecting 100% authenticity here since we are on the opposite end of the U.S., but I didn't really see any semblance of NY in this pizza.  In addition, our mushroom pizza hardly had any mushrooms in it, and the ones that were in there were shriveled, small, and hidden inside the pizza- I probably wouldn't have noticed any difference in taste in this mushroom pizza from a regular cheese pizza.  We ordered a dozen honey hot wings as well, which I liked substantially better.  They were a nice combination of spicy, salty, and sweet."}
{"text":"I've came here before so I know the pizza is good. Maybe I came too close to closing but the Hero wasn't as good as I had hoped. I ordered a roast beef and I didn't notice much flavor and it was a bit soggy. The staff was friendly enough but looked ready to get out of their 20 minutes to close. The price was fair for what I ordered."}
{"text":"For the overall experience of dining in, I have to give the place an average rating. Is the pizza good? Yes - definitely good. The Wings? Yum! I love the hot wings. I have never ordered a full pizza, only a slice. Typically I go with the 1 slice + 6 wing & drink combo for $6.

What detracts from the experience for me is the wait - today I ordered the above mentioned combo at 11:45 and while the wings arrived somewhat quickly, the slice of pepporoni pizza took a long time. I finally had a complete order and started eating at 12:15. The second thing is the size. This place is about the size of a closet - definitely sucks if you are trying to fit a group of people. By group I would say more than 3. There are a few tables in the main room, a couple outside and some in the back room. The problem is there is no traffic flow - the hallway between the rooms is narrow. If the tables are filled, which normally they are, people stand in the room, the hallway and make it challenging to get through. The fountain drink machine is in the back room and makes for a pile up while people try to find a spot, fill a drink and try to back out of the way. As popular as the business is, an expansion is definitely needed!"}
{"text":"Venezias Pizza personally is a place that you eat at and then EVERY other pizza you try after that meets no comparison. I have been spoiled by this chain for years and years and never have I been burnt out by eating here or decide to bother elsewhere. It's my go-to. 
My complaint for Venezias is there aren't any in the Chandler/Ahwatukkee area so the closet one is still 15 miles being in Gilbert or Tempe. 
Neither deliver to Chandler Mall sadly. 
Also, they offer low-carb Pizza bowls which I am obsessed with. Do not overload on toppings though, keep it simple because the juices accumulate at the bottom of the pan. Just sayin'

Make a home in Chandler!!"}
{"text":"The best when it comes to salads. Fresh and always satisfaction guaranteed. I enjoyed the spinach salad today. Greens are crisp, roasted red peppers were perfect and the walnuts a nice touch. I would however recommend going into the location to order versus online."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite pizza place! Cannot beat the pricing for the party pizza (believe me, I mathed out the square inches- bigger is better!) the Italian Stallion is the best!"}
{"text":"This location has the best staff.  No matter if you are dinning in, carry out, or having dinner delivered, they always take care of my order: fast and friendly!! 
The only thing they are missing is a military discount."}
{"text":"(Guadalupe & Ellsworth)

I order from them quite often. The pizza is good when it doesn't have 25% of it covered in bubbled up crust. And what's worse is they sent it out for delivery. Their quality control is lacking. And they never seem to ever slice the pizza all the way. I always have to go back and cut it again when I get home. I know it sounds picky but it gets annoying especially when you give them a lot of business.

However what bugs me about this place is they nickel and dime you for every little thing. I understand they are in business to make money but they seem to take it a bit too for with extra little charges.

It is good pizza but you can tell it's run by a high school crowd. Inconsistent with food and service. The dine-in experience seems to yield slightly better results in consistency. However the one at Guadalupe & Ellsworth is a little crowded at times. They also have a small outdoor patio which is nice when it's not 110 degrees outside."}
{"text":"Love this place for pizza! Usually come for lunch since they have great lunch specials. The slices are a decent size and tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while visiting Tempe. I love pizza and this place didn't disappoint. NY pizza done right. 
We ordered half pepperoni and half veggie, and it wasn't too heavy or greasy. I also tried the Greek salad, which was so fresh and crisp. I tried my friends garden salad with balsamic dressing, which was also good. Apparently they have a pizza challenge were you eat one of their largest pie within a time limit. Pretty cool to pass the time looking at all the losers...and few winners. Anyway, it appeared pretty modern in decor and was clean. The service was friendly and prompt. The only downside about this place was that it was very smokey inside. That kind-of 
-hindered the in-dining experience."}
{"text":"Venizias!  Absolutely amazing pizza and wings.  I would highly recommend this little pizzeria to anyone that claims to be a fan of NY style pies.  I find myself having a hard time remembering to breath when I hold a slice in my hand.  Somewhat dangerous, but very worth it!!

Well done Venezias!  I am a fan for life!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 pizzas and requested it delivered at a certain time. The pizza was delivered 30 minutes early. I called to express my disappointment and they credited the price of my pizza. I was amazed they went above and beyond to satisfy me. I never expected to have them to do this. I just wanted to let them know so it does not happen in the future.  I would recommend them to anyone who wants good pizza."}
{"text":"Known about Venezia's ever since I was in high school. Would goto the one on pecks and McQueen that recently moved to Cooper and ray I think.  I was excited to find one near my work on the was side.  Been here many many times and have never been disappointed.  My favorite and beat pizza in Az.  I compare all other pizza restaurants ( I could live off pizza) and none have surpasses venezias!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. Dependable and does not disappoint. Still the best New York style pizza you will find in Arizona."}
{"text":"This place is pizza goodness....greatness, stupendous! Never have I had pizza like this and I can't wait for my father to come in town so that I can take him there, after that experience I am quite sure that his visits to Phoenix will be quite more frequent. Let's break down the good, the bad and the ugly about this establishment! 

The Good. They deliver quite far and when they deliver the pizza is still hot and fresh, almost like they took it out of oven, stepped in a Star Trek teleporter and knocked on your door. I got the meat lovers the first time I had them and I've been in love every since. When I took that first bite.....the way the cheeses and meats and spices all merged together and melted in my mouth.... I became mentally and foodmotionally  distressed and stood in my kitchen unsure of what to do next because the flavors just blew me away. I ended up skipping the plate and took the entire box and sat in front of the TV and snuggle ate. Which brings me to my next point... 

More good news, it reheats really well the next day. Again more foodgasms to be had! The next time I had them I went and ordered dine in with a friend (the establishment is really nice!). She too was overwhelmed in a great way. I was having a bad day that day so I did what any logical thinking woman would do,  I ordered cheesecake.... again MY GOD! 

Either way I've said enough! Just go...or order in at home. 

Oh by the way there is no bad or ugly... Well I take that back...when they say their wings are hot... THEY ARE HOT...so use discretion but whatever happens with that is between you, your esophagus, and the porcelain Gods which may get ugly depending on what kind of relationship you have with aforementioned Gods.  5 stars from me all the way!"}
{"text":"one of our favorite pizza places can't go wrong with the pepperoni and cheese bread also they have really great ranch!"}
{"text":"Very large slices of pizza so we get your money's worth. The Hawaiian and the spicy buffalo are both really good slices. The daily specials are really great. I don't live close by but I would be willing to make the drive out for the pizza and the cannolis. Also they have a large selection of fountain drinks and they also have three flavors of China mist if you aren't a soda drinker. Tables we clean and the bathrooms were really clean as well. Customer service was above par. Great job guys."}
{"text":"Well, I hate reviewers that leave a  back story before every post... but I must say being from New York this is the closest to N.Y. style pizza you will ever get living in Arizona. 

That being said...

This place not only taste delicious but it has great specials... all freaking day. I usually get special c. A 1 topping pizza and 6 wings ... extra crispy always."}
{"text":"This is my go-to delivery spot for pizza and wings, and with good reason. 

Their margherita pizzas are just... proper. Absolutely spot-on. Big ol' balls of mozzarella melted down to beautiful creamy circles, fresh basil and a really nice sauce. There's just something really comforting about having a reliable pizza like this. I've been trying to find a good, consistent margherita for some time now, and Venezia's delivers the exact same pie every single time.

Their wings are also really good. Their spicy wings actually have a bit of kick to 'em- enough to make your lips tingle but not enough to make you cry the next day. Nobody needs anything quite that spicy.

Nobody."}
{"text":"I recently read Arizona is the best state for pizza. I think that's crazy. But Venezias easily is my favorite pizza when I can't be in New York"}
{"text":"Pizza NY style which can be hard to find here in the desert. Order at the counter and they'll call your name or if a full pie they'll bring it to your table. Drinks you fill yourself but you can refill as many times as you want. Slices are large which you can just fold to eat like a good New Yorker. Garlic, oregano, red pepper, and grated cheese are on the tables ready for you to top your slices."}
{"text":"I've been looking to try this place ever since Ray's pizza closed and another place very close by which has been my substitute was closed. 

First, this is not hand tossed pizza - it is pretty much the same pizza you get at Domino's, Little Caesars and the like. It's pressed dough, not foldable, and just doesn't distinguish itself from any other local pizza place. I was very disappointed as I drove past three other places to try this New York Style pizza. 

Perhaps I'm being overly critical - technically, the store name is New York Style \"Pizzeria.\" So maybe I shouldn't have expected New York style pizza. 

Ironically the other pizza place very close by says nothing about it's pizza being New York style - but it's a lot closer than Venezias, and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza's by the slice or by the pie! Pretty spacious for a pizza place, friendly staff and an awesome selection of different kinds of pizza's. You can order by the slice and try something different or customize a pizza for yourself. I really enjoyed the chicken pesto, buffalo chicken and of course sausage and pepperoni. If you are in the area, skip the other places and stop by Venezias!"}
{"text":"Love Venezia's we always go tot he one on Cooper, and the staff there knows us now which is a plus. They let my little girl stand at the counter and watch them work, and are always going the extra mile for great service.

The food is amazing, I am not going to say its 5 star dining but if you are looking for great slice of pie, or anything else they offer it is great. The wings are awesome too! Not to mention the combos they have here are truly awesome priced and they have a app for your phone to get rewards! 

I would go here all the time if I could!"}
{"text":"Soggy crust, unimpressive quality of toppings, WAYYYYYyyyyyyyyyyyyyYYYYYYYYYYYyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too many onions & bell peppers & olives, so not enough meatage (no homo), heavily overpriced ($15 for a small pizza whaaaaaat??) = I. AM. DISAPPOINT.

And still hungry.  For less-sucky pizza, that is."}
{"text":"This place is great! Only once have the messed up my order. I ordered their cannolis and they forgot the put then in the take out bag. I called and they fixed it! Aside from that, every single time I've been here, it has been great service and food."}
{"text":"After seeing people come back to work with these white Venezia's pizza boxes for the past couple months, I suspected that they knew something that perhaps I didn't...and I was correct. What they knew, and I had the pleasure of finding out today, was that you CAN get a damn good lunch for under $6! Their special consisting of 2 huge one-topping slices and a drink was just right...I left fully satisfied and full, without that \"I just swallowed a brick\" feeling. I definitely intend to make this a regular weekly lunch spot, keep up the good work guys!

**UPDATE** I just need to make a quick addition to my review here, I have recently fallen in love with their chicken pesto pizza, oh my, this stuff is AMAZING. Granted, 6 hours later when you burp you'll taste it all over again (and my friend's wife doesn't appreciate the garlic breath that results from these slices), but it's a sacrifice well worth making. Also, even though they charge extra for a side of ranch, it's a necessity for dipping and a perfect compliment to their crust."}
{"text":"Some of the most rude staff I had ever encountered. I had ordered a slice and a side of ranch. That's it. When my slice came out I asked for the side of ranch I paid for. The same girl who rang me up refused to give me the 50¬¢ side of ranch before I showed her my receipt that I had to scramble to find. I should have just paid for another side of ranch. Would have been easier than trying to find my receipt and watch my pizza get cold."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here all the time for the slice of pizza and wings combo they do really good job with wings and all the different kinds of pieces I really like"}
{"text":"Easily one of favorite go-to pizza places in the Tempe area. 

I've never been there when it's too busy, and the pizza always satisfies. There's a decent selection of styles that you can choose from, and they always have specialty pizzas in case you're like me and enjoy trying something new. The slices are huge and the price reflects that, but I've never walked away regretting spending money at Venezia's.

It's not going to be the most amazing slice you've ever had, but I'd gladly take Venezia's over any other large pizza chain."}
{"text":"I had Venezia's deliver a pizza to my hotel room and it was a very good NY style pizza. Lots of cheese...which is a requirement. Good pepperoni. Deliver took a while, but it was a busy evening. I would highly recommend for delivery."}
{"text":"When I was first introduced to the place a couple years ago, I thought this place was fantastic.  The slices were huge, there was always a huge selection of pizzas on display, and the wings were great.  But after about a year of going there, I kid you not, weekly, I started to see a drop in standard.  The pizzas weren't always warm, if you asked for say a mushroom slice, be prepared to get canned mushroom thrown on a reheated cheese slice.  The wings weren't always warm either, and sometimes lacked the sauce that once made these wings great.  Recently, I've noticed that they've gotten rid of the punch cards (I guess not many people were using them anyway), and my favorite honey-hot wings.  Instead, I was told that I could get honey-mild wings, or get hot wings and pay for a side of honey.  I'm going to stop myself here before I go on a rant, but that drove me over the edge and well, the only reason I'll be stopping by in the future, is out of nostalgia of the place this used to be."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and zucchini.  We enjoyed very much!  Will go again.  Delivery guy was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Best pizza In Tempe. Been coming here for years always always a delicious pizza. Give this place a try !!"}
{"text":"These guys have some of the best pizza and wings around. Love the slice and wing combos for dine-in.

The wings are pretty spicy and recommend ordering the Medium first (usually order Hot  everywhere else). They use a nice chunky Blue Cheese dressing and the wings come with Carrots and Celery, too."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this pizza shop!  I always get fantastic pizza and wings here.  Also, the staff is the best; very accommodating.  They we able to write a joke on the box to cheer up my husband after he received bad news.  It was a cute joke that got a small smirk from him.  Anyway, the food is fantastic, and the staff go above and beyond for their customers."}
{"text":"If only there were more of you, Venezia's (specifically one in Old Town Scottsdale). One of the few pizza places in the valley that are doing it right. I love that I can walk in, grab two slices with a drink, and be out in 20 minutes for under $9. More pizza places in Phoenix need to follow your lead. Everything is good here, but my usual is a classic pepperoni. Do yourself a favor and check this place out if you're in Tempe or near another location!"}
{"text":"My wife and I come here often as this is our favorite pizza place. We actually drive over 15 miles to come, it's that good. Today we were taken back as to how dirty and filthy the restaurant was. The dining room had trash on the floor through out and most ( I would say about 85%) of the tables were very dirty and left unbussed. Made it difficult to find a place to sit that was clean without having to wipe down are own table. Not to mention the tremendous eye sore looking into the dining room and seeing trash everywhere. Have to say, not our best experience dining in. Food was great though!"}
{"text":"I will say I miss the days when this place was much smaller and just basically a hallway with a pizza oven . it can get a little crowded and annoying but I can't fault them for being successful and expanding. That aside this is my favorite new York slice of pizza in town.  How it should be a piece so big you gotta fold it in half and get your hands a little greasy . they also have bomb calzones . and pretty good wings for the price.  Though the wing sauce is not my favorite its still not bad. One knock I will say I wish they stayed open later . this location esp is right between 3 of the best dive bars in tempe and if they were open late if be here prob every night after some beers."}
{"text":"Ingredients were good but the crust is always  mush even when we ask for extra crispy. Not good. Won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying Venezia's is my new pizza obsession. I have been to many pizza places in my lifetime and they are the best by far in AZ for a fast casual pie. I am a little perplexed at some of the other reviews on here complaining about \"greasy\" pizza. Do you know what causes grease?  High quality meat toppings for starters and whole milk mozz! If you want skim milk mozz with modified food starch added, go to Papa Johns. The bigger point here is, their pizza is not even that greasy! Do yourself a favor, hop aboard the Venezia's fanclub train and experience on of the better pies in the valley! Bonus, they manage to have great customer service even when the line is out the door!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I immediately want to compare it to Slices in downtown Tempe... so I'm going to: Venezia's is better.

The service can be a bit slow at Venezia's, but once I got my food, I was happy. I've ordered many different slices of pizza here--the cheese is just melty goodness and the toppings are fresh and evenly placed. I recommend pairing your slice(s) with some wings or a salad because they have both and they compliment the pizza well. Like others have said, it would be nice to have an ice cold beer with my pizza, but since they don't, their focus is more on the food and it clearly shows."}
{"text":"By far my favorite thin-crust takeout pizza available in the area, and an overall good value. The quality cheese and crust make the pizza!"}
{"text":"large slices of delicious pizza, the place smells awesome when you walk in also...i usually get pesto chicken pizza. and the meatballs are great too but they are pork, just so you know. It has real fast service even though its crowded/packed everytime I go."}
{"text":"Crust & ranch are the best! Slice specials arn't bad. Good place for lunch. Highly recommend. Only Pizza place in town that's actually worth spending money."}
{"text":"Good pizza but the staff was overwhelmed and the service suffered a bit. Seemed situational rather than a chronic problem.   Kids meal options were a nice change."}
{"text":"This has been our go-to place for some great pizza and wings. However, the last time we ordered from there we were so disappointed. We ordered 2 orders of well done wings and they were soggy with slimy skin instead. We order well-done because we don't like them any other way. We also ordered pizza and it was cold. To pay $40 and have less than mediocre food is not acceptable."}
{"text":"How are you going to mess up an order on National Pizza Day? The last 5 - 6 times we got pizza from there it was a soggy mess, or different ingredients than ordered. Friday I order 2 slices (Tempe Location) you forgot the topping on 1, ran back put it on top (cold) and put pepperoni on the other, I don't eat meat. Drive home only to throw it away. Thanks"}
{"text":"Best hot wings, huge slices of pizza, and awesome happy hour specials. Last I checked $2.50 beers after 8pm, yes please!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Valley!  The Italian Stallion is amazing.  I also recommend any of the appetizers"}
{"text":"Since I moved to Tempe a year and a half ago this has become my favorite Pizza Shop, by far. They have the best part of NY style pizza right there on the counter: The Shakies, all the goodies that you can shake on top. I'm a Garlic Powder, Parmesan, Red Pepper guy myself. I hate when a shop says it's NY style and has no shakies, that's part of the style, go to NYC and you'll see. If you get the slice special, you won't be eating for awhile, good deal for the money you pay. O and they have wings, mmmm, god-like wings made the right way with Frank's Red Hot.
 The only reason that I cannot give Venazia's 5 stars is because of a couple bad delivery experiences. The last time I waited an hour and 15 minutes before calling to check my status. The owner(Brian?) answered and explained that I had called back and said that i was picking it up instead( o, really?). I asked him why he didn't call after the order sat over an hour, plus the fact that whenever I call they already have my number, so a different number would have called and no one on this earth knew I ordered anyways. He didn't seem to care either way, which is bad customer service, especially for a loyal customer. So I felt kind of slighted. But I won't let that stop me from eating their great food, I only eat-in now  :D"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Venezias? We've ordered pizza here several times from different locations and they've never disappointed. We love the party pizzas! The ratio of crust, sauce & cheese on the party pizzas is perfect."}
{"text":"Pizza was just ok.   Not much flavor in the sauce and crust was chewy.  Their pizza is pretty expensive - I had a coupon which made it more affordable.  Probably will not order from here again."}
{"text":"The good: Wings were very good. Medium hot was not hot at all. Place was busy and everything seemed fresh. 

The not so good: I asked for thin crust and crispy pies (ordered 3) and they came out thin and soggy. 

New York style pizza, it ain't."}
{"text":"Get the daily special.  Also, they offer a Yelp deal.($1.00 off the daily slice special...I think.)  Anyways, if you are feeling adventurous, you can try the giant pizza challenge. (Think of this as the 96er steak challenge from the John Candy movie, \"The Great Outdoors.\")"}
{"text":"Went here last night for a quick bite and it was amazing. I'm from Philly and I sure miss my East coast foods. This place was on point. Fast, friendly service. Nothing to complain. It was spacious and had a huge selection. The pizza was so good. The fries were amazing. I can't wait go to back and try their wings!!"}
{"text":"This New York style pizza was bomb it made my mouth water! Back in 1990 when I lived in New York City I would go on Fifth Avenue and eat a paper thin pizza and this place hands-down is a New York style pizza I will recommend any person that loves pizza to come here"}
{"text":"This is the first time i have actually eaten AT a Venezia's. I've had their Pizza on several occasions and it has always been good. This was no exception. Usually thin crusts are so so but theirs is flavorful and not just dry and crunchy.
The place was nice and clean. The people were friendly.
I was a little put off that the yelp coupon wasn't taken. But then i read that it's not good with certain items.
We ordered 5 slices, 1/2 order of wings and 3 drinks $25. Not bad."}
{"text":"Do you like pizza? Yeah you do!  This is the place to be if you're lookin for a hearty slice and a good deal. With specials such as their two slices, a slice and salad, slide and 1/2 order of wings, and more for around $8 bucks including a drink - can you really go wrong??

Been here several times before and always taken advantage of these meal deals. The slices are huge and filling. The pizza has always been delicious, fresh, and hot and they usually have a good selection of specialty type slices to compliment the usual options. 

Best deal - slice and a salad. It's just enough pizza to fit your craving and the salad makes you feel better about the pizza :D"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in the valley, the wings are fantastic!  Love their food, they do really good with delivery.  Of late it is never more that 45 min, which is great I think.  They have decent coupons online as well.  My daughter loves their fried Zucchinni."}
{"text":"Good service! But being a New Yorker, the pizza is just ok, nothing beats pizza from New York!  This pizza doesn't even really come close except the size of the slice."}
{"text":"We have a location on Ellsworth right down the road from our house and decided to try it out. I ordered online and it was done in a timely manner. When we got home we opened up the boxes and our Margherita pizza was absolutely disgusting looking. 

It was straight pizza sauce, lots and lots of pizza sauce, clumps of mozzarella, and some basil leaves. No tomatoes whatsoever. 

We also got a veggie, which was actually good, but I was looking forward to a great Margherita pizza. Probably won't order from them again!

I added a picture."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. 

Everyone told me how this was the best pizza and I don't see it. I take a bite and I end up with all the cheese and I'm holding a piece of sauced bread in my hand. And that's even after it cools down. 

I'll eat it though. It's close and they have GF options for my man. 

Best thing are their wings."}
{"text":"I use to love venezias and it was my go to spot when my sons had their basketball team over . I order atleast a few times a month . Unfortunately we won't be going here anymore because their new manager Joel decided it's more important to be demeaning rather than take an order . I called to place to order for pick up and i saw a coupon for a large 1 item with 2 orders of boneless wings  . Joel tells me he couldn't find that coupon and asks me for the code . I provided the code and he said that code is for a large not xtra large. That's what i told him but rather than argue i went along with it . I just wanted to pick up the pizza and go home .  I asked if the boneless can be upgraded and that i was Willing to pay the upcharge . He said that they can't do it . I told him they've done it before . He said my last order was boneless  and he's the manager and can see my whole order history . I let him know that I've been order from atleast 10 years and I've never had any issues with changing them to boneless . I let him know that his condescending attitude just cost them a loyal customer . I know my little $70 a month won't make a difference but i don't need the hassle ."}
{"text":"Meh. Friday night and they have tons of pre cooked pizza sitting there. Not fresh, salad that came in the combo was decent."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal customer since the first location opened here in Arizona. I love the new dining addition they added! This location is always clean, everyone's very friendly and the food never ever disappoints! I wish they would open s location in San Tan Valley!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and the delivery is always on time or early! Had the Mala pizza and it was awesome. Pepperoni, chicken, and French fries make an unlikely but epic combo."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for the first time today after the gym (it's next door). I always see people going in a lot, so I figured I would try it out. And I'm glad I did. 

I'll start with the service. Most places I go, the service is mediocre to horrible and I have come to expect that from most places in Phoenix. However, the woman who helped me was very friendly and provided excellent service. And the wait time was reasonable for how busy it was. 

As for the food, the pizza was amazing- I ordered the Italian Stallion. My first bite was in the car, and I had to rush home to finish eating it! Definitely the best pizza I've had since I've lived in Phoenix. I plan on recommending the pizza to have catered at work. 

The wings on the other hand, nothing I would order again. They were soggy and not anything impressive. Maybe it's my fault for ordering boneless? 

If you want some awesome pizza though, definitely eat here!"}
{"text":"The best Italian pizza place in Phoenix! Doesn't beat a true New York style
Pizza, but it gets really close! The Pesto Chicken pizza is the best thing on earth. Their wings are really good too! Definitely a must eat place to go in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I would give them zero stars I i could. I ordered from them at 6:50 and 2 hours later I had to call them to find out where my order was only to find out that the manager didn't confirm my grub hub order and I had to wait another 30 min before I would have any food. Then his resolution was to get ahold of grub hub to get 50% off. I'm sorry, but my kids have been waiting for 2hrs already. Never again will I order from them. Worse customer service. PERIOD"}
{"text":"Place is still excellent three years later. 
2 item combos for under 8 bucks and I've never had a bad wing at this location. (Also has amazing ranch)

I see people kvetching that the pizza isn't as amazing or as NY authentic as the one at Grimaldi's.... Puzzles me why your comparing a eat-in coal fired pizza in Scottsdale with a more casual slice place like Venezias. The two serve completely different categories in my opinion. A more fair comparison would be the nearby Slice's or Sal's pizza which Venezia's blows away.

A lunchtime/gameday staple"}
{"text":"The pizza is superior to the competition across the street. We primarily get take out so I will save the fifth star for my next eat in experience. Sandwiches are great also. They have never messed up my order which is rare for a place I eat often."}
{"text":"venizias is a good place to get that large slice of thin ny pizza .. always plenty of toppings and cheese and sauce ...  wings definitely tasty and cooked right... a fan and have been for awhile ..."}
{"text":"It's not five-star pizza, since I'm originally from NYC. However, I've tried as many different pizza places I could find in the East Valley, and this is the best. Their crust is not quite authentic, but it is the right consistency and isn't the sad, doughy Chicago-style pizza that is more prevalent around here. The price for a regular pie is good, but their specialty pies are a little pricey. However, the lunch specials are a great value as the slices are from a 24\" pie. The Friday meat-lovers special, and the daily chicken pesto pizza are my favorites."}
{"text":"Eh, it was alright. I'm sure it'd be better if I actually went there versus getting it delivered. It didn't live up to my NY pizza expectations."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good. The wings were undercooked, and uneatable."}
{"text":"Skylar: \"How much for the pizza?\"
Walter: \"It's on the house.\"

The crave for pizza was real and since I was on the way to the airport, Venezia's became the pit stop. Located in a plaza, ironically placed next to a massive LA Fitness Venezia's looks like a typical pizza shop but don't let that fool you. Upon entering, you are able to see an open kitchen with diligently workers are tending their task in pizza making. They serve pasta, salad, wings, protein bowls and of course pizza! I ended up sharing a small supreme pizza and wings with my friend. Service is fast and you get your food brought to your table.

We got Honey BBQ wings were great! I appreciated the crisp exterior, but juicy interior. The sauce was good and was served along side crudit√©s that of course were dunked in ranch dressing. Their ranch dressing is also out of this world good. The pizza is thin, well deserving of the New York title, gooey and stretchy cheese that can only be seen in cartoons and yummy toppings. Toppings included mushrooms, sausage, pepperoni, green peppers, onions and black olives. I also have to mention how much I enjoyed the crust, because TBH I'm a crust hater and leave them on my plate stacked like Lincoln logs. However, the crust here was chewy and soft. The one gripe I have here, was the fact that if you didn't pick up your pizza correctly, or folded it all of the toppings - cheese and all would slide off! The flavor and everything else made up for that though. Also, I had the pizza for left overs and it was just as good and the cheese was still amazingly stretchy!

Fast service, delicious pizza fresh or as left overs, price point a little more expensive than your usual pizza shops but portion and quality trumps.

Check-in on Yelp for a discount!"}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice or whole, I used to live next to the Tempe location and now find myself near the east mesa Venezias. Consistently good quality pizza in AZ, can't beat that."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here!  New York style crust, big slices, and tons of toppings to choose from.  I like that I can go in get a variety of slices and be out in a matter of mins!! Oh and they have a great selection of fountain drinks #MountainDewKickStart"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in AZ! have been a faithful customer for almost 10 years. Close, convenient and as I am from the East Coast I can vouch for the taste and quality of their pies. Love the slices too!"}
{"text":"Wow...best customer service by far!! Placed a pick up order, haven't been placed one in awhile. Place was busy, I could tell everyone busting tale in there. Well I got home and got someone else's wings by mistake. I called to let them know and they drove my order of wings right over....never have I been offered this service!! This just might be my new favorite pizza place...pizza=yumm!! Wings=yumm!!  And they obviously care about their customers!!!"}
{"text":"Venezia's delivers!  I mean that in every sense of the word.  

We were out looking around the area one day and found this location.  Since we had just eaten we did not stop but I put it in my memory banks for future meals.  I checked their website and found that they delivered to my area.  Yay!  There is nothing like good pizza delivery after a long day. 
I have ordered delivery many times from this location and each time they appear at my door in the alloted timeframe with my fresh, hot pizza exactly the way I ordered it!  I have never called them but used their online ordering system and it works like a charm.  My requests have always been fulfilled.  The delivery drivers deliver with a smile and are always courteous. 

As for the pizza.....YUM!  It is a New York Style pizza with lots of cheese and great, fresh toppings.  They  have Sicilian style but I'm kinda stuck on NY.  :)  They also have a children's menu.  My daughter is a picky eater and, while she like plain cheese pizza her favorite is black olives.  I can order the mini cheese and have black olives put on it for her and that works much better then getting a portion of a larger pizza for her.  She is happy having her very own little pizza.  Their salads are always fresh and crisp.  I have not tried their wings yet but I'm sure I will.  They have some great specials too.  

If you are near one of their locations within their delivery area give them a try!  I'm sure I will go to this location at some point but their delivery is so great, I'm not sure when that will be.  

Thank you for delivering Venezia's!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a pizza connoisseur from Joisey. The pizza is excellent. Based on the marinara and crust, I can assume that the sandwiches are just as good. I'll be trying everything, and looking forward to it. Just so happens its around the corner from my house, but I'd drive further for this thin crust goodness. I'll update as I try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week. You can't beat the lunch specials, especially on Fridays when its a giant slice of meat lovers, 6 wings (bone in or boneless) and a drink for 7 bucks. Pizza is always good. 

Now I'm just looking to find a partner to take on the giant pizza challenge with me, I want my picture on the wall!"}
{"text":"Yous wanna go haves onna pie?

This place has the best NY style I've found yet in the EV.  Thinner crust, perfect for folding in on itself and jamming it in your pie-hole NY style.  They use real Italian sausage and other quality ingredients.  Nice tomato sauce, just the right amount of cheese.  Big slices, 2-3 is the max per person.  My favorite pizza so far in AZ."}
{"text":"BEST DELIVERY PIZZA IN PHOENIX! i loooooooove love love Venezia's. like... love it. We order the party pizza. 1. because its a crap load of pizza. 2. its a great price. 3. we want many leftovers. Quality is great, service is great. Skip the papa johns and pizza hut. Get yourself some Venezia's. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"This place is EXCELLENT.  My only complaint is the line at lunch time!  Great pizza, fair prices, good wings, all around great place!!"}
{"text":"Good fast delivery. Ordered through Yelp Eat 24 and it was seamless. 
We order traditional Buffalo wings and they were good. I prefer mine a little cripsier, so I'll request that next time. Wings were a good size and had flavor.

We splurged and got the Italian fries... I would say those are better for dine in as they get cool on the delivery route and stick together versus being ooey-gooey.

Overall good food and ervice."}
{"text":"My first experience at Venezias did not live up to expectations. Pizza was not anything special and the wait was a little long even though we got 4 slices. One of the slices did not have jalape√±os, even though we asked for them. Also, I had an olive on my slice, which I did not enjoy. Service was nice, and workers were friendly. Not worth the wait, but worth the low price for the low quality."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of pizza but dang (meat lovers is amazing), this place is bomb. The calzones are my fav, and the salads and wings mmmmmmm :)"}
{"text":"Great food first time I ordered I wasn't too certain but after giving them a second chance I've been a regular. Everytime Ive ordered since the food has been great and the service as well. The pizza has always been cooked perfect with a generous amount of cheese. The wings are always crispy and they also have delicious cheesecake. Definitely worth it!! Thumbs up! I'm glad to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I love all the food here.  Wings, sandwiches, and of couse pizza.  They recently remodeled, and the place looks great.  They have a very large dining area, and of course delivery and take-out.

In college, we ordered the 26 inch pizza on a regular basis.  It is collossal!

The 2 slices and a drink or slice, side salad and a drink special for around $5 is a winner too.

In general, everything they serve is good to great.  If you are a jerk you could probably find something to complain about, but overall, nice people like this place and this place likes us.

Nowadays, I am a big fan of ordering the following:

1.  Italian Sub

2.  Large 2 topping suggestions:  

                          a.  Fresh garlic and tomatoes

                          b.  Pepperoni and black olives

                          c.  Pinneapple and Jalepeno

3.  Any of their specialty pizzas!  They are all great!

4.  Wings.  These are decent wings.



Overall, Venezia's is doing enough things right to please every member of your group, so it is a good place to bring your family or friends."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Venezias since moving to east Mesa several years ago.  However, I have experienced a slow decrease in quality over the past year.   Most recently, I ordered a small greek salad with no onions and one order of honey BBQ wings for pick-up.  What I picked up was a greek salad loaded with onions and mediocre wings that had been cooked long before my order.  I've had better frozen wings from my freezer and I could have made a salad myself in less time than it took to pick the onions out of my ordered salad.  My recommendation is to stick to the pizza here.  Oh and if you want a cup of ice or water, expect to pay fountain drink prices."}
{"text":"WOW is where I will begin!!!  The best Crumb Cake ever created!!! We ordered a Large Cheese, Supreme & Hawaiian Pizza with a side of wings and their Tiramisu and did I mention the Crumb Cake is out of this world?!?!!!

So glad we ordered as much as we did because we're visiting AZ from Los Angeles and this will make great leftovers after our hockey game tomorrow #GoLAJrKingsGo 

Don't be put off by the prices of this pizzeria because it was worth every penny and then some! The delivery man was extremely nice as well!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Everybody here is friendly and helpful when looking st the menu. Joel was super nice and helped us get the best pizza at a good proce for the party"}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is awesome. Their delivery range is HUGE, and they are open late, which will practically get anyone 5 stars in Gilbert when you can't get any delivery past 8pm most days. 

Their chicken wings are the best I've had in the area. Where other restaurants will sell you something dry and tough with hardly any meat to be picked from the bones, Venezia's wings are absolutely tasty. I have ordered chicken wings from them almost a dozen times at this point, and every time the quality has been consistently good: plump, juicy meat that tastes delicious and falls off the bone. I have cravings for their chicken wings. 

Their pizza is good. The crust is homemade, the sauce is good. We have only ordered the veggie and it's delicious. 

Delivery is always on time and the people are always really nice. 

We are new regulars. I have been so obsessed with the chicken wings I haven't branched out to other menu items yet. Definitely recommend, especially for delivery."}
{"text":"I actually really like the pizza here. The wings are pretty good too. And I also get a bowl of salad which is not bad at all."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Valley for its 'class.' Hands down. Trust me - I'm a pizza fanatic."}
{"text":"Personally, I don't care for their pizza, though it is decent enough that I'll get it sometimes with a coupon. Their sandwiches are very good though. Delivery is efficient, and the prices are about what you would expect. In all, a decent place, but not outstanding. I still miss Luigi's."}
{"text":"So I'm new to the area and have pretty limited options as far as decent pizza. I used to live in east Mesa near a Venezias pizza that was our go to. Last night was the second time I ordered and it was still sub par. So I'm technically rating for two different experiences but not much changed. Last time I ordered a pizza the crust was super soggy. This time I ordered well done and it didn't seem to be an improvement. Was still soggy and harder to chew. I even got the thin crust. Not sure what's up, I love this style pizza and I know they can do better. 
My other grievance were the wings: ordered sauce on side and extra done. Still... soggy. The chicken seemed fine but the skin was wet. I understand that they were to go but I've never received soggy wings from anywhere else. 

I want to order again but only after things improve."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza place. The pizza is always great, on time and warm. Wings are always good, not too much sauce and the kids even like the mild traditional sauce. Their ranch is pretty yummy too. Reliable quality.

They mail out coupons and always include them with your purchase.

Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Been going here for years, by far my favorite quick pizza and wing stop! It's been a lot nicer to dine in after the remodel a number of years ago. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Some of the best NY style pizza I've had!  I was in town on business and wound up coming here both days for lunch.  Plenty of cheese on the slices that I had, the pizza sauce is really good and the crust was cooked just right.  They have Pepsi - big plus for me because I despise Coke, yet it seems to be in every restaurant these days :-)  I gave the chocolate cake a try the second day and it was really good too!  They have a really nice seating area with plenty of televisions, and the staff were cheery and wonderful."}
{"text":"My husband has been craving good NY-style pizza for a while now, and I found Venezia's thanks to Yelp. I went in person to place a to-go order and the place was really busy - it was filled with people sitting down to eat, waiting for to pick-up a phone order, and placing to-go orders. The woman who took my order was still really friendly and patient, despite how busy it was. I ordered a large one-topping pizza ($10.50 with a coupon I found in the paper menu sitting on the counter), a dozen Honey Hot boneless wings ($7.99), and a small salad ($2.99). The wait was 20-25 minutes but the woman was upfront about how long it would be, and the food was definitely worth the wait!

The pizza was really good - tomato sauce that was savory, not sweet, the right amount of real mozzarella, and a crust that was the perfect combination of crunchy and chewy. The wings weren't the best I've ever had, but they used good-quality chicken and had a pretty flavorful sauce. The salad was also pretty good, with fresh lettuce and pepperoncinis. A lot of pizza places skimp on the salad, but this was a decent side salad for ~$3. 

Venezia's is a great place to get good-quality NY pizza and sides. They deliver, but I'm not sure how far they'll go. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious! We order two pizzas. One was their supreme, the other half pepperoni and half cheese with extra cheese over it all. I worried about ordering online but it came perfect! I paid online as well with tip included so no money was due when the food arrived."}
{"text":"I took my family here for an early dinner this evening.  We ordered a double order of boneless wings and a large pizza with pepperoni, black olives and jalapeno, one of their slices of supreme pizza and some sodas. Was nice because they were not very busy yet. The food arrived really quick. I did have to remind them about the slice we ordered.

Boneless Wings:  Let's face it... these are not wings, they are chunks of chicken dipped in a shitload of batter and deep fried. Basically chicken nuggets. They taste pretty good. We ordered them with the medium sauce and unfortunately the sauce only made it onto about 2/3rds of them. The rest were dry...so we went up to get a couple more ranch dressings and were charged nearly $1 for them. Seriously....? Yes...super lame.

Pizza: Came piping hot but not made like they usually make them. There was hardly any toppings on the pizza and the sauce to cheese ratio was way off. I picked up a piece and the toppings slid off of the crust.  There was too much sauce and not much cheese. Peter Piper Pizza does better than this... I kid you not!!

It's mediocre here ... won't be going back. Plenty of other places that have decent pizza to pay for this."}
{"text":"Love, Love Love this place. Best pizza great price. Coupons online. Can't say enough. Had some today they delivered to my work. YUM!!!!!!!! Good wings too. Great lunch specials. Try it out!"}
{"text":"We have been ordering Venezias forever. Yes it is that good. A few tips :
They use plenty of sauce. Not like papa domino. 
But not for the sandwiches. If you order a sandwich (and you should) ask for extra marinara plus a side of marinara. You can thank me later. 
If you order a supreme or something with lots of veggies and you don't like it mushy with veggie juices order it well done. Dipping sauce optional but why not."}
{"text":"Omg. Love Venezias. I often dream of swimming in their cheese pizza. Hot and bubbly. The best pizza you can get delivered in the east valley by far. We've ordered once every couple of weeks for a long time and the quality is always there. This pizza is too good to top, but if you want toppings they will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I've gotten take-out from his place 4 times.   It's a bit out of the way for me, but freakin awesome!  So much better than Sal's in Gilbert.  

I'm from Brooklyn NY and this pizza is legit.  Well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Took the wee baby down for her first slice of Venezias and we were not disappointed. The ladies working the counter brought our food to our table because I'm still new at taking her out and they just kept saying how cute she was. I got my normal slice with Golden Mild wings and they were bomb as usual!!! Thanks for the great service"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. I only come here for the lunch specials. I have also had their baked sandwiches and they're great also. I love the meatball sub. Chicken wings are great, too."}
{"text":"Delicious New York City style thin crust pizza. Lunch slices are tremendously tasty and huge! Also, very affordable. My favorite is just cheese and pepperoni. The strombolis are also delicious and service is decent."}
{"text":"Love Venezias! Always great. Sometimes they forget the sauces with our order BUT the food makes up for it. And the chocolate Cannolis are to die for good!!"}
{"text":"This pizza is absolutely amazing. The slices are very large, thin, and have excellent flavor. The mac and cheese bites appetizer was also very impressive."}
{"text":"The pizza here is really something else and different from regular pizza places. Their pizza is just really fresh and delicious and full of yum!!!! Go here over your typical Papa Johns if youre looking for the best pizza!"}
{"text":"Venezia's is by far the best place to get a slice in Tempe. 2 slices and a drink for $5.50, and the slice are huge and can be hard for me to finish. The pizza is always fresh and hasn't been sitting out all day like at Slices. The wings and salads are average, but will get the job done when needed. The sandwiches are legit, but stick to the pizza, you won't be disappointed. It used to be an awkward table set up but they just re-did the seating. Bottom line it's the best NY style slice around!"}
{"text":"Really thought I had already reviewed this place but I guess not. I don't even have to think twice about giving this place 5 stars. 

The pizza is awesome, probably some of my favorite in Tempe and definitely my favorite quick takeout pizza in the area. The wings are also really good probably right behind The Vine's in my book (yes I consider The Vine to have the best wings around Tempe). Put this together into a combo with a half dozen wings, a huge slice of pizza, and a drink all for $6 and I'm sold. 

This combo is probably one of the best deals around ASU especially considering how good the food is. The cool thing about the combos here is that they're not just lunch specials so if I come at some random time or even for dinner I can still get my $6 pizza, wings, and a drink. Also, the place seems freshly remodeled and there are a bunch of TV's everywhere so it wouldn't be a bad place to grab some food and catch part of a game or something on the cheap. I really have nothing bad to say about this place at all, easily 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  You're in Arizona.  You should know how rare that is.  I've been multiple times and they haven't done anything wrong.

If the ovens were hotter, you'd make better pizza.  But this ain't New Haven, so what do you expect?"}
{"text":"Great food! For the price we had quite a bit of food. We had delivery I can imagine how good it would be to eat at the location! The coupons it said we could use didn't work, which is a bummer but overall was great food !"}
{"text":"Ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza and it took them 20 minutes... It was a Sunday evening at 6... Dinner time."}
{"text":"Quite frequently my husband and I get food delivered to us from this location. We use coupon codes listed on their website that includes a large 1 item pizza and wings. They are nice enough to let me pick one topping on my half of the pizza and my husband picks his own topping for his side. I also occasionally order Greek salads which are a decent sized portion."}
{"text":"When I initially went here I ordered a normal pizza and while it was pretty good, it didn't really elicit a return visit. My work has used Venezia's several times and it was always way better than the pizza I ordered for myself, the only difference being the size. They always order the 24\" party pizzas. So I did the same and for whatever reason, the bigger pizzas are way better. Since then I've ordered several times and the pizza is always really good. So my suggestion is to go here, get the 24\" pizza and have pizza for 3 days straight for every meal."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza with mushrooms, pineapple, olives & canadian bacon baked just right !  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Meh. The food is average, the service is S L O W, and their prices for gluten-free pizza are simply outrageous compared to other places I have been."}
{"text":"This is my go to for pizza. If I'm craving pizza this is the place I call hands down no question. Everything is alway perfect. Pepperoni onions and garlic."}
{"text":"To all you Breaking Bad fans, the pizza is sliced. I was bumming when I saw that. I was hoping it was a pizza I could throw on my sister's roof, but nope. Too many slices. 

The large salad has a sweet Greek dressing. My BIL tossed my salad :) 

The pizza itself was pretty good.  It had a nice chewy crust and plenty of cheese, soft middle though."}
{"text":"I ordered the Italian Stallion and had it delivered.  I also used their online ordering for the first time.  The pizza had quality ingredients.  I requested done crispy and thats how it came.  The delivery time took about an hour and actually arrived 15 minutes earlier than their estimate.  So the pizza was tasty and good value at reasonable cost.  I will order again."}
{"text":"Amazing. Try the 2 slice and drink meat special on Fridays"}
{"text":"I ordered a medium size so i could take some home for leftovers. She said \"I'm just going to order it in the box-so you'll have it\". She took my NAME since I was eating there-not a pick-up. 

I saw people after me come and go, so went up to counter after 20 minutes & inquired. \"It's coming...we'll call your name\", she said.

Waited another 15 minutes, then went up again. Now my lunch time is over, and I don't even have my pizza.

\"Hmmm...let me check\"... she walked off.

It had been done 14 people ago (I looked at the number the box had on it, and the last number called. Since it was PUT IN A BOX, they figured it was take-out, and waited for someone to show up and ASK for it!

Now, after all that, the pizza was very...ordinary. Sauce (what little there was) was bland-like just tomato paste or something. Ingredients (which I ordered extra of-and PAID extra) were so sparse I though they'd left off the mushrooms...until I saw one on a slice. Yes. ONE.

People, if you think this is good pizza, go to Spinato's. Tempe or Ahwatukee. You will be AMAZED at what  a really tasty pie tastes like. 

I will NEVER go to this  brand again.  Overall BAD.

(I didn't even bother with a picture, and threw 3/4 of it in trash)"}
{"text":"Pizza, decent. Wings, okay.  Paying a little extra for gluten free pizza crust, to be expected.  Having that gluten free pizza come out with blackened edges, not cool.  There are plenty of pizza joints around here that care to have my business.  I guess Venezia's isn't among them."}
{"text":"Had a miscommunication about what we wanted exactly. They made it right and delivered it to our home. Great pizza and awesome cheese breadsticks and sauce. Their dipping sauce is really good. We will be back, thanks for the great service."}
{"text":"Solid pizza done right.  Both of the salads we had were also good.  Service by the woman running the till/taking orders was meh.. and the reason for the 4 stars.  My wife said \"she hates her job\".  Otherwise, a good experience."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in AZ. Always get a huge slice of cheese, always hot & fresh, great sauce, perfect amount of cheese and some hot wings which are awesome and very hot which is fine by me but if u don't like too spicy I suggest medium,  and a drink for just over $7, can't beat it. Come here at least once a week live closer to McKellips location but always drive to this one. Different owners or management I don't know but you can judge for yourself, it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and was craving pizza so after looking online I selected Venezia's   I ordered the Empire State. OMG! So flavorful! It is more than I'd usually spend on pizza, but it's Valentines Day. It takes about 45 min to arrive, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious as usual! Still waiting for that far west valley location, Avondale/Goodyear area!! ;)"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this pizza place, great food great prices, friendly service.  I enjoy coming here for lunch to get the slices.  Being from the east coast I find it hard to get good pizza out this way, and this spot definitely has that back home vibe and taste."}
{"text":"Wow being that I came from New York..this pizza is excellent! Just ordered large cheese pie to see how it was..i read some reviews first online to see what reviews were best!  You people got it right on the nose...they said 45 min. And it was 44..lol..excellent pie and Hot still
.love it..will be a returning customer for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Don't think I will be ordering again from this place.  Have tried it several times and I find Red Devil across the street to be so much better.  This last order was totally unacceptable and immediately went into the trash.  Way too much cheese and I couldn't even find the pepperoni let alone any mushrooms.  They always seem to be stingy with their toppings but not the cheese.  The wings are much better at Wingstop also.  Not sure why the good reviews here but this is not pizza and I would eat Dominos before ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Really too bad. We ordered pizza, they said up to an hour, after 1 1/2 hrs we called and said it was on away. We finally got the pizza and it was stone cold! Really sad since their pizza taste great, but not a cold one. Shame!"}
{"text":"I will try not to make this review too \"cheesey\", my aim is to be \"topping\" your expectation or at least \"meat\" it. (that's three by my count, booyah)

This place is my \"go to\" place for pizza. The pizza is delicious and the value is excellent. They have about 10 specials that they run all day. The specials include 1 slice, 2 slices, 1 slice and 6 wings, 1 slice and a salad and much more. The specials include a fountain drink as well. Just to give you a price point I usually get the 2 slice, 1 topping special with a drink and that is $5.75 plus tax. Now when I say the value is excellent it is because the slices are colossal, They shouldn't even call them slices they should be called slabs of pizza.

I have only dined-in and the service has been pretty quick, naturally the slices will come out quicker then the wings but the service is still pretty quick. There is plenty of seating and usually sports on the televisions.

All-in-all this is a great place for the following reasons:
1. Great food: Pizza = great, Wings = decent, Salad = what is a salad?
2. Great value for the amount of food.
3. Roomy atmosphere where you can bring the entire family or a group of friends to feast on the goodness."}
{"text":"This is hard to rate how many stars because service sucks but pizza and wings were decent. 
My husband and I went here for the first time and was trying to read the menu and figure out all the specials because they were signs all over the place. We couldn't figure out if it was an order at the counter then they bring you the food or you sit and order. 
Then the girl at the register just kept pushing us to order Rather than say oh, it's your first time? Let me explain what we have. There wasn't anyone else in line to order so she could have taken the minute to explain. So I felt rushed and didn't have time  to read and process the large menu. I finally just pulled the menu up online to read it. 
Once we paid she gave us the drink cups. Didn't specify where the drinks were. So we went to the right and found out they were on the left. Again. She didn't say anything.
Once our food came out. The pizza was good and hot but the wings were cold. So my guess is they just make a batch and have them to the side until people order them? 
Not sure if I want to go back. Maybe just order a pizza to go since the slices are huge and would be good for a big group. But that's about it."}
{"text":"I have eaten quite a few times at Venezias over the years, and at different locations. In all my visits this Gilbert location has been the most consistent in terms of quality and service. I try to avoid rush hour and busy times because it turns into a mad house. I typically get slices as I'm always in the mood for pizza; though I have had a salad and a few subs too. I like the massive size of the slices but I don't like the copious amount of grease on them - my guess is they use whole milk cheese. Taste is good, ingredients are fresh, and experience is always fun."}
{"text":"Solid place for pizza by the slice. Quality eats at reasonable prices. I have enjoyed my food every time!"}
{"text":"I got a pizza craving tonight and I usually order from Papa John's when I get such cravings but I wanted to try some place different. I saw a 4 star rating on Yelp and being only a mile away I went with Venezia's. Oh Boy! I'll never order pizza from here again. I got a large pizza with green pepper, jalapeno, pineapple and mushroom and it was not good. 

1. The pizza crust is really, really salty. Very much like a pizza dough you'd buy from a grocery store. 

2. There is so little sauce on the pizza that you can't even taste the sauce. It makes the pizza real dry. 

3. The toppings are not all equal quantity. I order pineapple on all my pizzas because it adds sweetness. I like the contrast between the salt from the cheese and the sweet pineapple. There was so little pineapple on my pizza I could barely taste it. 

4. The jalapeno's are not fresh; they are marinated or pickled. They are extremely briny it just added to the saltiness of the crust which nullified any sweetness I could have gotten from the tiny bit of pineapple there was.

I do not recommend this pizza place. If you want to spend $17+ for a salty pizza with sparse toppings go right ahead otherwise go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is the spot if you want NY style pizza. The slices are humongous and a great value for only $2.50! 
They are always so busy, but the service is quick as they never seem to be understaffed. Overall a great atmosphere whether just for a quick bite or family get together."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch because the other restaurant I wanted to go to had closed. The atmosphere was fine and my food arrived quickly but I did not really care for my pizza. I tried their barbecue chicken pizza and I know sometimes those don't turn out so great and this was one of them. The barbecue sauce was plain and boring the cheese didn't really have much flavor and I didn't think much of the crust. Maybe if I go back I'll try something else but I really don't think it's one of the best pizza places I've tried
It is cool to read about its relationship to Breaking Bad, but other than that I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Great pizza!!! I love it a lot. The slices of pizza are huge! My boyfriend tends to also order the wings a lot and says they are really good, though I do not remember exactly which ones he orders. Personally I love the pizza because the sauce is not have overly sweet sauce that many places use. I have always liked more savory flavor anyhow. You can order specialty pizza or make you own as in most places. They have really good coupon deals as well. 

I have always had great customer service here, the restaurant is clean. The bathrooms are also very clean. You can see straight into the kitchen where everyone is working. You do not tend to have to wait in line, and if there is one it moves along quickly.

There has not been a single time I have been here that it has not been crowded. Usually this is always a testament to how good a place is. In this case, the testament is true. I would recommend this place to all pizza lovers."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner! They have daily specials also and big slices of pizza! Good food, friendly staff clean and kid approved!"}
{"text":"Best slices in town, in my opinion. Lots of variety of slices with toppings and they don't just throw toppings on top as they reheat the slice. The pizzas are made with the toppings on them, unlike some other slices places. Great lunch specials for huge slices with salad or wings to mix it up. The wings are hotter than normal. If you normally get medium, get mild, if you normally get hot you may want to get medium, if you don't want tingling lips after lunch. I wish they had coke products but other than that this is a perfect spot for lunch any day of the week. It does get busy at lunch time but they're used to it and orders come out pretty quickly. If you order anything hot that isn't pizza be prepared to wait a little bit longer, they even have a sign that says so. Tvs to watch sports are nice too."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here before, you don't live in Tempe.  Been my number one choice in pizza for nearly 2 decades, back before it was even Venezia's!!  Still going strong, and never need a reason to go in for a slice special.  Great job guys and keep it up!!"}
{"text":"When I worked in the on-line retail world our company would order pizza from Venezia's.  Then I found out I was working with one of the owners.  He left his secure job to start slinging pizza's full time and hasn't looked back.   

I miss not having one of their pizza's at least once a month and last night we decided to order a pizza for dinner and I also had one of their small tossed salads.  

I have yet to be disappointed with any of their food.   The homemade lasagna is awesome.  Their tossed salad is more then just a couple of pieces of wilted lettuce and cherry tomatoes. They have cucumbers and some wonderful peppers, which really adds to the flavor, and a plethora of croutons.

We always order one of the specialty pizzas the Venezias Special.  It's made of awesome goodness.   If it were up to me I would eat one of the Park Avenue or White pizza because those are my absolute favorite.  

The prices are higher than a chain restaurant but you also get what you pay for.   I'd eat here three times a week if I could afford."}
{"text":"Have only had delivery, but the food has always been on point. Salads, boneless wings & cheese bread w/ marinara are all good. Haven't had the pizza."}
{"text":"awesome service!!  got the wrong pizza via delivery and when we called they fixed it and sent the right one....thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Well what a quick way to lose a new customer. I called in before hand to order a pizza and once I got there they told me \"I never called in\" \"Are you sure you called the right store\" so I just walked out. I was a brand new customer who has never tried this place ever and the one time I wanted to get some my order just disappears. gg Venezias."}
{"text":"Ordered \"mild honey\" wings for take-out, get to my office and there are buffalo wings with a side of honey to dip the wings in. If I am paying $9.00 for wings I would have expected them to have \"honey mild\" sauce on them, not a big side of honey for me to dip them in, so nasty. I called and asked if that was how they were normally made and typically the sauce is on the wings unless requested otherwise, anyways   the girl on the phone didn't apologize didn't offer to fix them, just told me to dump the honey on top. Not a good first experience and definitely will never go back."}
{"text":"I love this place, I forgot how I found it. Maybe by accident. This place is great. Pizza is awesome, Calzone's are out of this world. They have daily specials we have taken advantage of and I still want to try their LARGE PIZZA, the biggest one I have seen. Very relaxing atmosphere and have always had a great experience."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza after you remove some of the grease!  Friendly staff.  Place is always busy.  Pizza is usually delivered sooner than later.  Don't forget to get a stamp card."}
{"text":"Most of the time we get good pizza from this restaurant. However, the last three times we ordered chicken wings they were dry and almost inedible! I don't know what's gong on with this location lately, but these chicken wings AREN'T CHEAP, so if I'm going to pay top dollar for a dozen I should at least be able to bite into them. So my advice is order the pizza, it's pretty good, but the chicken wings HORRIBLE!!!!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza by the slice deals.  Chicken Pesto is amazing!  Their cheesy garlic bead is really good too.  Been going to Venezia's for 13 years now and it's been consistently yummy!"}
{"text":"This pizzas is so delicious! We recently went in to order to go and got drinks with our food. When we went to the drink station I noticed a bug which looked like a baby cockroach. I don't want to stop coming here but I want Management to be aware that their staff needs to be a little more cautious about their cleanliness."}
{"text":"If you like cheese ..and cheese..and cheese and more cheese but very little sauce with calzones and pizza, this is your place! 
Couple that with a rude delivery driver and you're winning! 
Antipasto was incredible though ."}
{"text":"The pizza here is different then what you'll typically find in AZ, thin NY style slices that taste even better then they smell and they smell amazing. Nice variety of lunch options that are reasonably priced and will fill you up! Every time I've been here the food comes out ready to eat perfect temp. Never dripping cheese off the sides, greasy, or too hot burning your mouth with the first bite, keep it up"}
{"text":"Came in with my family for a late lunch, front service was great although i did not recieve a complete order apparently a half order is not a half dozen ( although ive always recieved 6 WINGS previously even at the Tempe Location) the guy argued with me that half dozen only comes with 5 WINGS.. Issue needs to be address immediately before complaints come up.. Ive never had any issue whatsover everytime i eat at the tempe location..."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza hands down. I've traveled all across this globe and have found that Venezia's is the best. Even beats all pizza I've ever eaten in my 10+ trips to Italy. I recommend it all day long!"}
{"text":"Has to be one of the better Pizza places around town!

Awesome hot pizza, great wings!!

Wish they had some more tables ; )"}
{"text":"I went to this pizza place and I won't be going back. From what I can tell, from some of the Yelp responses, the owner seems to be Italian. I mean with a name like (Dominick M.) I am assuming he is Italian. But perhaps, if he weren't, it might explain why this pizza place is run the way it is. But anyway, if he comes from my home town of Chicago (not likely because no one from Chicago would ever put NY on their pizza place), or any of the East Coast Cities, like New York, Providence or Philadelphia, he has obviously lost his way. The kids he is hiring, know nothing about service, let alone pizza or the traditional neighborhood Italian pizza place. This could be forgiven, I know ASU kids come from all over the country (but provide some training, for crying out loud). But what can't be forgiven, is the way they sell pizza by the slice. When pizza is sold by the slice, it is one price across the board (with possible exception for cheese pizza). This place tries to charge $2.79 for the base cheese and sauce on the slice, plus .45 cents for each topping. Leaving one to break out the calculator, count toppings and add up what the cost of each type of pizza slice is (an absolutely ridiculous way of pricing slices). Then there is happy hour pricing, with a dollar off per slice, but that starts at 8 PM. Again ridiculous, one, because I did not see a bar in this pizza place, two, this is not the type of place I would go to drink for happy hour because they don't serve spirits. I cannot say with 100% certainty that they did not have a bar because I did not get past the bubble head working the register, who could not explain the pricing structure of pizza by the slice, before I got frustrated and walked out.  But I guess they do serve beer and wine because a sign in the window indicated that they had just gotten their B&W license. Anyway, I can't speak to the quality of the food because I did not eat there, but if it is anything like the customer service or restaurant management, I am sure I did not miss much. Serves me right for going anywhere other than Spinato's for pizza, the only place I know that serves real Chicago thin crust West of the Mississippi."}
{"text":"I used to go to this location twice a week or more. I will never come here again and never recommend it again. This place is plagued by bad management and total incompetence. The lead general manager being the worst of the bunch. He is just too much.

My mother ordered her usual, a garden salad. It was very poorly made with barely any vegetables and browning lettuce. When we went to the manager (as regulars who come here 2+ times a week) we told him something wasn't quite right. He told us \"People rave about our salads. Its fine. If you really want another one we'll make it for you but it won't be any better.\" That is not acceptable customer service.

The last 3 times I have come we ordered the most simple thing possible, 6 slices of pizza with one topping on each. Three arrived after 30 minutes, the other three arrived after another 15 minutes. This is not a one time incident. This is the norm at this point.

The pizza quality is down too. It is greasier then ever before, and I like it well done, but two arrived burnt, and one arrived cold after 35 minutes of waiting. Not ok.

Much better options are available in the area where you'll actually get a slice of pizza at a pizza place in under 45 minutes, and the older manager/owner won't treat your family like second class citizens. Imagine that?"}
{"text":"The BF and I picked up pizza from this place for linner today after I looked it up on Yelp. We ordered a small half cheese half pepperoni pizza and some garlic bread. Both were alright.... nothing too special. It wasn't too expensive and it was better than fast food pizza but it wasn't great and I probably wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"First time having Venezias was a surprisingly nice experience. I expected chain store take out box pizza. What I got was a finely crafted New York style pizza, and yes, you could fold the rather large slice over and eat it like New Yorkers do. The toppings were generous and evenly distributed. The crust was soft and thin not chewy. It had a nice tasting sauce that worked well with the toppings. The pizza could have had a little more cheese to suit me. I will be ordering this pizza in the future if not dining in at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love it! 
We had our favorite pizza place then we moved to tempe and had to find a new one. Venezia's is perfect, we ordered it based on other reviews and fell in love. 
It's always delivered on time and piping hot! It has the perfect ratio of cheese, sauce and crust. In short we are now lifetime Venezia's fans!!"}
{"text":"We ordered through YELP and had delivery.  Pizza came sooner than we expected and tasted great!"}
{"text":"3rd of 3 Venezia's locations I frequent. BBQ+hot wings are superb as always, pizza slices are generous and delicioso, and service always fast & friendly. Their lunch specials are all screaming deals. One of my main go-to spots for lunch, whichever one I may be closest to."}
{"text":"GREAT pizza, and at a good price too.  They have a manhole-cover-sized 24-incher that's great for parties, and they sell $2 slices that come from this monster-sized pie, 1-2 slices enough for a nice, filling lunch.  The crust and sauce are great, everything is just right.  Great lunch specials too, and lots of good side items, like the best side salad I've seen in ages.  A solid 5-star recommendation."}
{"text":"Was an OK pizza.  Wasn't super impressed with it.  Frankly I'm surprised people give it the reviews they give it.  Its one step above Little Caesars and I feel even Pizza Hut & Domino is better.  Very expensive too for the food quality.  Would not go again, sorry."}
{"text":"Awesome pizzas and salads.  Also I love that I can order a whole pizza or just come in for a slice."}
{"text":"The pizza was okay, nothing spectacular. The chocolate cake was dry. Would not visit again."}
{"text":"I have been eating Venezia's for over a decade now, mainly at the tempe location for lunches. Tonight however my wife and I wanted pizza so I thought way not get Venezia's we ordered BBQ Chicken pizza (from the Gilbert location) one of my favorites at other restaurants. Man do I feel like I just threw a way money. The pizza was hard, the chicken was dry and many of our bites didn't have any sauce. I can guarantee you I will not be craving Venezia's for a long time...if ever again. Stay a way from this location."}
{"text":"These people are obsessed with good service. And the pizza is the only one that my SO's stomach can handle. Plus it's amazing. Especially the white pizza!"}
{"text":"I did not like the pizza at all it was half Margarita pizza and half meat & Veggie neither were good did not like the sauce or the dough the delivery guy was nice though but no more for me"}
{"text":"Chandler doesn't even know how lucky it is!  This restaurant is outstanding in every way!  Lowest priced pizza I've seen in AZ and the best-tasting!  Their sicilian (*you must order a whole tray) is out-of-this-world good!  The slices are huge and one or two will fill a hungry person.  The wing sauce is perfection, and I hear the chicken wings themselves are delicious.  Whether I'm walking up or calling in, the food never takes longer than 15 minutes to prepare, and it is *always* worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Best customer service! I had accidentally called the other mesa location and made my order instead of the usual Ellsworth location. When I went to pick up they couldn't find my order but once we figured it out, the manager came and said he would call the other store to handle it and that they could get my order in now and be ready in 15. The pizza came out with a huge bubble and they remade it because it \"wasn't to their standard\" which made it easy to wait for a new one. We moved here April 2016 and every Friday night is our family movie and pizza night. We get the XL half cheese/pepperoni and there's maybe a slice and a half left between the five of us. My three kids all love the pizza. I usually order a salad and it's always fresh, crisp lettuce, the veggies taste like they're from a backyard garden, and their ranch... seriously... best ranch! We will continue to be customers as long as we live here."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a slice of pizza for lunch or get a pizza for a party deliver. Big slices of pizza"}
{"text":"Delivery-- 

It'll be an hour even if you're across the street; then again, you're lazy, so can you really complain? They're bringing you food.

Then, the food--

It's thin crust pizza. It's not remarkable. It's edible and tasty, but nothing special. A-OK."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've ordered over the phone for pick up and asked for extra sauce, and most pizzerias barely add any more but this place knows exactly how extra sauce should be done. On my last visit a lovely worker by the name of Delora I believe took my order and later checked up if everything was going okay, great service and great food at a great price!! (Also they always have like the best music playing)."}
{"text":"Venezia's is one of the greatest lunch spots ever!

1 slice of pizza, 1 salad and 1 drink for $5!! 

And don't misunderstand, 1 slice of pizza is bigger than your head. They have a slice of the day in addition to their regulars, but don't let that stop you from getting creative.

They also have the most amazing ranch dressing for dipping. 

It gets a big crowded on Fridays, so go early. But if you're on a budget and you're looking for some tasty pizza, this is where you need to be!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Pizza places ever!  Great pizza by the slice or whole pie and other menu items are great!  Discover east coast style pizza right here in the southwest!"}
{"text":"Great pizza here. Pasta was ok.
Make sure to check your oder because sometimes item(s) are missing & need to back to remind/ask for it.
Lasagne took a while to get. Staff are friendly & courteous here."}
{"text":"not a bad place to get pizza, but not great. my problem with the pizza is that there is too much bread/crust and not enough cheese/toppings. however, their Greek salad is good for a salad you would get at a pizza place. I'd come here again, but for the price I much prefer NYPD or even Papa John's!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza and wings hands down. Lately, they are starting to lose quality like the chains. The last time I ordered pizza, the cheese was barely there and the toppings were sliding off. 

I usually order Ham + pineapple and 2 dozen HOT wings. I used to order honey hot, but about 6 months ago all of the wing places started setting honey on the side instead of in the sauce (conspiracy?), so I just order hot and pour my own honey on.

The coupon deals on facebook and emails are the exactly the same as on their website. If they had better deals that could compete with the chain prices a bit more, I would order more often."}
{"text":"Stopped in about 730pm and got two pizzas to go. Service was friendly and the restaraunt was very clean.  The had two good size tv's with the Diamondbacks playing (and winning)! 

The pizzas were pretty average. We found that the simple pepperoni was much better than the supreme.  The supreme we ordered was a bit soggy..had to be from the toppings (although how I don't know because they were a bit sparse).  What really nailed this pizza as average/below average was the small amount of cheese they put on the pizza.  I could actually see the pizza base through the toppings, sauce and cheese.  Pretty disappointing.   

I would probably give it one more try (everyone has a bad day now and then) but if I was in the mood for a guaranteed good pizza I'd probably just go over the nearby (within a few miles) Gilbert pizza."}
{"text":"It is great pizza!! Always order it.. Big slices, great boneless wings!!! The down side is that  I Always order delivery and twice messed up my order...only want extra cheese on half the pizza and they put it on the whole pizza...wasnt cut properly. I just ordered the pizza tonight and was really craving it and excited.  then open the box and not what I ordered. I don't understand how the order can get messed up? Is frustrating. So now I am going to have to check my pizza first before they leave! That's the only thing that is a bummer. I definitely would still recommend but just check to make sure it's done correctly..."}
{"text":"Man this place gets packed at lunch!  But of course it would - HUGE  slices of NY style pizza are flowing freely around this place.  And some awesome lunch specials.  In the $5-6 range you can get 2 1 topping slices and a drink, 1 slice and a salad or 1 slice and some wings.  They even have a student special for 1 slice and a drink for like $3.65.  Nice.  

I wasn't lying about the size of the pizza.  I measured - longer than my wrist to my elbow.  About as wide at the top as my hand from finger to tip of wrist.  Will this be the same for everyone?  Um, duh - no.  BUT I'm not obscenely small or funky shaped so you can trust me that this is a huge piece of pizza.  

The place is cool.  Seating outside on the covered strip-mall strip watching folks walk out of LA Fitness nearby or inside.  During a packed lunch good luck finding a table.  It can happen, but you have to be like a hawk and swoop on in quickly.  

Hint - if you want to shock and amaze your friends - get their 24\" Party Pizza.  Heck, get more than one.  The boxes alone will shock people.  Huge huge pizza."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza by the slice jointd in Phoenix.....I realy go for the fresh mozzarella balls and sopresetta ... The one complaint is that no one at the register knows about the mozzarella and always ask if I want mozzarella sticks. I don't go every week so I woud often forget if it was two or four balls per order. It feels like im takling to a deer in headlights when I asked that question. Ive memorized the answer (two mozzarella balls per order) I would end up ordering two orders and get four. Still dirt cheap so not a true complaint. Pizza itself is new York style thin slices great crust prices are respectable especially with the combo options for slices and a drink."}
{"text":"Still my favorite pick up pizza joints in town... Not bougie just quality product respectable price. Only spot in town where I buy my fresh mozzarella and sopresetta.... I'm writing this review as I wait so can't vouch for the canoli yet. The fella who took my order was named Joe and he is the first dude to not be confused about my request about fresh mozzarella! Truly made my day. Th slices are always good true NY style and large slices for cheap.... Usually have about five choices plus slice of the day"}
{"text":"I am not ready to say it's my favorite pizza ever but it IS very good pizza.  And their party size is HUGE.  We get this pizza for take-out regularly and choose it over the other options within about a 2 mile radius.  Sauce has good flavor, good amount of cheese, generous with the toppings, all good.  Found out last time we went in that they have cannoli's that are molto fantastico!  All in all, a great place to have around the corner."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've ever had.  Mind you, I've never been to Italy, New York, or Chicago.... But we do love pizza in our family and we usually try to order from less commercialized pizza joints.... And we've had some amazing pizza from other parts of the country.... But this is our favorite!   Hands down.  I've never ordered their pastas.   Wings are ok.  Pizza is the bomb!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here last week with a \"welcome to the neighborhood\" coupon. Both pizzas were greasy with barely any sauce. The guy making the pizza was not wearing gloves or a hairnet and had really long hair. This probably happens at other places and I just happened to catch it because I picked up my pizzas. Won't be ordering from here again. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra 15 minutes to Floridino's."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. My order tonight changed my opinion of this place, I don't care how good the food. From the phone call to order the pizza with Cesar answering the phone and being a real jerk to the arrival to get the pizza 15 minutes later (like we were quoted), and being treated like we were an inconvenience.... we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I started coming here a few months ago and I think I've been back every week since. The pizza is the best I've had since I moved here from Chicago over 10 years ago! I usually come in on Sunday after church with my family and Dana, Devon, and Kaylee all know me and my family by name already. Come to think of it, this is the only restaurant we have had that happen in since chicago. It's nice to be more than just another ticket like some of our other regular places.
We always order pizza, wings, and a salad. Boring I know, but why try anything else when they are always so good. I'm getting hungry writing this knowing tomorrow is Sunday! 
We are moving the Mesa in a couple of months and fingers crossed their other location will be as exceptional as this one."}
{"text":"This place lost it. Ive been coming to this location since they first opened. I noticed the quality of their food dropped a few years back. Each time we order a pizza its cold, the wings have no sauce, and the veggie bag sucks (one celery stick and 2 half carrot sticks) i know."}
{"text":"Pillowy soft crust with dusted semolina on the bottom with gorgeous sauce that has a real \"bright\" fruity tomato taste, and silky smooth Mozzerella cheese makes for a great slice at this place.  Exceptional values are available at lunch as well.  Many pies available for selecting a slice at lunch, and the atmosphere is unpretentious with a checkerboard feel to it.  Staff was friendly.  Downside are the ASU types that frequent the place - and that lame placard that indicates it was the #1 slice pizza chosen by ASU residential life dormatories... who cares?"}
{"text":"I ordered double pepperoni and double cheese.  Good thing, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to call it pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered $50 worth of food. Took over an hour and a half to get, it was only one pizza, wings, cheesy bread, and wanted to try the fried macoroni. 
Got the food and it was all cold. The wings were warm but pizza was cold and bland.

But those fried macaroni were stale and cold. My boys love pizza, won't even complain about frozen pizza, but they wouldn't eat a whole slice of this stuff.

What a waste, not happy with this."}
{"text":"Love the pizza bowls. Finally a low carb friendly pizza delivery spot that is awesome. Gotta try it!"}
{"text":"After 7 years I have given up on this place. Pizza has gone down hill and prices have soared. Must be I am not alone, They seem to be advertising a lot to bring business back."}
{"text":"It's more like a 3.5 but I'll round down.

Their pizza is really good. I have to order the gluten free pizza, but Venezia's is my go to place for Gluten free pizza. It's easily one of the best GF pizzas I've ever tried.
However, honestly, I think they're over priced. Not to mention, their coupons are pretty sucky. And especially since ALL I can get is the GF pizza, it sucks that there are never any coupons I can actually use. I mean, it's pizza. Not a steak dinner.
If they had better prices, or better coupons, I'd definitely give them 5 stars. Because it is wonderful pizza. But I can't have it that often because of their prices."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get some legit pizza! In a world being destroyed by hot and readys and 5 buck pizzzas these guys stay true to good ingredients and phenomenal taste! Also with the quantity and quality it's a super good deal! I love it try it out you'll see!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are new to Mesa, and just randomly found this place. It's awesome! The pizza came with tons of toppings on it, the caprese salad was delicious and they delivered it all in under 45 minutes."}
{"text":"I recently just moved to Scottsdale and have been searching for good reviews on a big slice of cheesy pizza, this place is so good, I came at lunch as did everyone else, but it was so fast and efficient. The staff is really nice, the young lady at the register helped me pick a special, I came on a Friday, had the meat lovers slice with their 5pc hot wings. I'm stuffed with happiness. Not only is it super delicious, it's very cheap. My son ate an entire slice, and these slices are HUGE! We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Out of the last five pick-up orders at the Cooper & Ray location, four have been wrong...done with this place."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing, wings delicious big cooked crispy lots of sauce, got the veggie plate yum!! Parmesan peppercorn dressing is delicious. Fast delivery too"}
{"text":"Our family decided to give them a try after a long day and not wanting to cook.

Unfortunately for them and us it wasn't meant to be. We waited almost 2 hours (yeah you read that right) for a single pizza to be delivered. We placed multiple calls during that time and each time we were told this is normal and the delivery guy was almost there. 

Even worse we weren't met with apologies or offers to remedy the situation so we cancelled. That is our first and last experience with Venezias. 

Since I can't review the pizza if you're looking for a good NY slice try NYPD Pizza or Grimaldi's"}
{"text":"Love this spot!!! We eat here at least once a week. Slices are great, full pies are delicious, salads and wings are tasty. The service is always fast and friendly whether in the restaurant or delivered.  For large
 groups try the 24\" pizza and feed everyone."}
{"text":"I think this wins for best pizza crust! Our favorite pizza is the Italian Stallion. I like the spicy marinara sauce they use on it, but you can sub that for regular marinara on any pizza. Friendly employees, clean restaurant. Good place for kids, families, and they have lots of big TVs to watch sports on."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this place for about three years now.  They have fantastic daily slice specials.  I think the pizza is better ordered off the menu, but you can't go wrong with the slice specials.  Some of my favorites are the BBQ chicken pizza, pizza bianco, and Italian Stallion.  The calzones are good and always on special on Saturdays.  I haven't tried all the sandwiches, but the ones i have had have been pretty good.  The pasta was decent as well.  If the pasta offerings interest you, the kid's meal size is pretty good if you don't want to gorge yourself.  They have lots of beverage choices at the fountain.  The staff is always friendly, and the dining room is clean."}
{"text":"Just moved by this location in May, and tried it the first time. I must say.. the slices are HUGE!! And oh so yummy. BTW the BBQ Hot wings are divine! (: Needless to say this has become our families to go pizza place. Very affordable, always coupons for them and the staff has always been very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been getting Venezia's pizza since I moved out to Tempe for ASU and have loved that it's so close to my place and usually pretty quick for delivery time. 

However, this time I got my delivery and was not too impressed. I ordered a salad, which was opened and spilled in the bag it came in and didn't come with the dressing. Everything else was pretty good and the food tastes very good!! 

I was just taken back by the person who delivered my food. The issue was he couldn't find my apartment so I answered his phone call and tried to direct him in the right direction. I decided to step outside to see where he was. Well he was right in front of my place so I went and got my food from him. He was very rude and argued with me on why I wasn't more clear of where I live. I guess I should have been, but the directions I gave were pretty descriptive. 

All in all, I was just very disappointed in the service. I guess next time I'll be picking up the food instead of getting delivery."}
{"text":"We get take out pizza from Venezia's a couple times a month! I think this pizza is pretty similar to back east pizza. We have had the salad, the garlic bread and the meatball sandwich, all are very good! The price is good as well. Wish there was a location closer to my house! The only thing I might say that needs a little help is the customer service.  The employees are not as friendly as they could be....."}
{"text":"We ordered a 14\" and a single order of wings at 5:34pm online for delivery. By 6:50pm we still hadn't received our order. I called to see if maybe the online order didn't send. I spoke to a gentlemen who informed me that they were low on drivers and that a manager had picked up my order 10min's ago to deliver it herself. 15 min after I spoke to him the person delivering the pizza called and explained she was lost. We had ordered from Venenzia's for delivery before with the previous drivers having no problem finding our home. I gave her directions and about 5 min later she showed up. Even with the late delivery I left a standard tip for her and brought the pizza inside. It's 7:10pm by this point and my boys were so excited it finally arrived. We open the pizza box and it was clear the pizza had been sitting out for quite awhile. The pizza was cold and the wings were room temp. The condensation from the packaging had left them soggy and inedible. Frustrated after waiting close to 2hrs for a medium pizza and single order of wings I call to speak to management. I was placed on hold and eventually was disconnected. I decided to drive the order back and ask for a refund. The gentlemen at the counter was apologetic and offered to remake the order ensuring it would take 10-15 min. 20min's later our order was called. The counter lady didn't stay long enough for me to tell her we were missing half our order, the wings. After ignoring us for awhile she came back long enough for me to tell her we did not receive the wings with the pizza order. She asked us to give them 5 more min to get them out...  by 8:15 we finally left with our correct order. The pizza and wings were tasty but absolutely not worth waiting well over 2 1/2 hrs for. I rated them two stars, one for taste and the other for the gentlemen at the counter being the only one in the building caring about rectifying the poor service. Note to self and to anyone reading this... Do not order from Venezia's during peak hours, ever!"}
{"text":"In a world of average pizza this one fits the bill.

I ordered a large white pizza with pepperoni.  It was meh"}
{"text":"Pizza and I have a long standing love affair. Growing up in Chicago, I am definately a fan of deep dish. However, in my travels I have grown to love many of the different types of pizza made in this great country. As a result, I've had some horrible pizza and some pizza that would make you smack your grandma. 

When I stumbled upon Venezia's last year, I was skeptical. I've grown very picky over the years and was having a hard time finding pizza in tempe. So I did a random google search for pizza in Tempe and came across venezia's. Since then, my family has had a torrid love affiar with this wonderful establishment.


Their pizza is awesome. The crust is always perfect and the sauce isn't too sweet. They do tend to go a little heavy on the cheese at times but it doesn't seem like overkill. Their calzones, wings and cheese bread are also delicious. We tried some of their desserts last time and they were great.

The service here is wonderful. I love a place that I can order online. Nothing stinks more than having to repeat yourself 15 times to the person on the other line who is standing in the loud pizza shop. The food always comes hot and fresh. They actually have cheese and peppers with them which is always nice.

Their prices are great too. Perfect for something that tastes so wonderful."}
{"text":"We were in search for a good pizza, however we found a GREAT pizza place. The reviews are correct! We had 3 slices and all were excellent. Huge slices and super quick service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I can no longer recommend this restaurant.  After the last few trips here, I am left not only unimpressed, but disappointed.

The last visit, we attempted to order three things on the menu and we were told they no longer made those.  In one instance, we were told the item had not been on the menu in months.  This was told to us in a rude manner even as we indicated where it was on the menu board above us!  In fact, every item we requested was \"not on the menu anymore,\" even though we were looking at it on the board AND in the paper menu.

We came to get some sort of tray of baked pasta because we were having a family dinner and we left with a tray of ziti with some nasty, dry meatballs on it without any cheese or anything.  They packed it up with a side of sauce that was barely enough for 1-2 people for a whole tray of pasta.  

The only thing good was the garlic bread.

For the price, this was not good.  We paid more than five times what it would have cost if we made this at home... and if we'd known we were just getting plain pasta... we would have boiled the water ourselves.

Their pizza has gone downhill recently, too.  I won't likely be ordering from Venezia's again."}
{"text":"Eh...I really WANT to love this place, but it just misses the mark on just about everything. The pizza is good, better than any chain crap. But, it's short of like, really good.  The wings are inconsistent, sometimes really good, sometimes yuck. It's the kind of place that if I don't feel like driving into Gilbert Pizza, I'll order from Venezia's or Barro's.

They have online ordering, which is awesome. They are local, and overall, they are pretty good.

I've also had the chicken parm, which I often crave in general. It's good. I wish they wrapped it in butcher paper rather than styrofoam, but it's good."}
{"text":"I love Venezias! I'm a big pizza lover and have tried all the major \"hot spot\" popular places all around the valley and this is always our #1! The ingredients are fresh, very obvious they did NOT come out of a can. Great taste, perfect ratios of sauce/cheese/ingredients. Delivery comes in half the amount of time they promise. Dining in is also pleasant. Employees always seem happy and helpful. Will always be a faithful customer!"}
