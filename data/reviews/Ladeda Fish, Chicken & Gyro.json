{"text":"Constantly ignore notes. You wrote \"no onion,\" you're getting onion, they don't care. You ask for extra \"sauce on the side,\" you'll never see it. Order a meal that includes meat, fries, and coleslaw? Yea, you're never going to see the coleslaw. Expect ketchup, cocktail sauce, mustard, napkins, silverware? Too bad. They won't give you any. This review is based on several orders, not just one bad experience. Their fried food is decent, but don't expect it all to arrive. Did you order a meal that included fries and a canned soda? Yea, you're never going to see that soda. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food for a good price. The chicken wings are very good, they are whole wings, but on the smaller size. The fried okra is okay, but I'm not really a big fan of okra to begin with so take it for what it is. The fries were very good, they reminded me of Long John Silvers fries. I would have to say the gyro was the highlight, it was very good and not overstuffed like many gyros."}
{"text":"What a great find! I do highly recommend you try this place.  The jumbo shrimp, chicken strips and their gyro's are amazing.  We were excited to find a place that has so many kinds of fish and chicken dinners in one place.  We were very happy that we stopped here for lunch.  We will definitely stop in again soon.  Thanks for a great meal Ladeda!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way home from shopping because it is close to my house and they had really good reviews. I had to write one of my own. The food is AMAZING!!!! The small dinner was enough food for me to share. The fish was so fresh and the breading was nice and crispy. The fries were very tasty and not greasy at all. This is so much better than fast food and I am so glad I stopped. Very impressed."}
{"text":"I ordered this place more than once the first week I discovered it. The food is always still warm when delivered. Everything is perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. I would not recommend the scallops on a delivery (they seem to be a little chewy). I do however highly recommend this place. The shrimp is amazing! Have yet to be dissapointed."}
{"text":"We ordered gyros, good flavor, and soft pita bread. Great customer service and friendly and accommodating atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had the Greek Gyro...The lamb meat is not the pre-sliced frozen version. Tasted average, not salty. Friendly staff, clean and well lit. Establishment is in a strip mall with plenty of parking"}
{"text":"I had the buffalo chicken gyro and fries. Yummy! Very casual place, but clean. Great friendly helpful staff."}
{"text":"I got a chicken gyro. Too salty and very very bland. Th restaurant is not clean. Staff smoking outside. A horrible experience."}
{"text":"They have the best gyros!!! I always order one every time I go but last time I went I got the gyro salad it was pretty good also."}
{"text":"The chicken dinner are amazing haven't tried nothing else yet because it's so good bt I will soon"}
{"text":"The steak and buffalo gyro is really good and also the garlic chili chicken wings!  The meat is also fresh"}
{"text":"I ordered a shrimp dinner through GrubHub for delivery. I placed the order at 4:12 pm. The estimated delivery time was 5:05pm- 5::15 pm. The order arrived at 6:12 pm. It was ONE HOUR late, and the manager refused to refund my money, giving some cockamamie excuses about the delivery driver being held up. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!"}
{"text":"Discovered this little slice of heaven after doing a Google search for wings in the Pittsburgh area. I asked people if they've ever eaten here to which no one had. I'm glad I was the first of my friends to eat here so I could tell them all to support this business and I'm extremely happy to report the wings are amazing. They are whole wings (not jumbo) and they sprinkle white pepper on the top of them and possibly other seasoning and it just makes it stand out over other wing joints. Cheese sticks, jalapeno poppers and breaded mushrooms are also fantastic. The ranch dressing is great and their marinara may also be homemade. If you haven't tried their food yet, it's definitely worth it. Any time I need a boat load of wings, I'll be ordering from here. Also if you spend over $30 you can save 20% off your order (or at least I did, mention the coupon on their website)!"}
