{"text":"Pizza is good and cheap. I like the crust. Don't like that chicken is considered two toppings."}
{"text":"sooooooo good!  The pizza is extremely customizable and delicious with a great price. staff is friendly, efficient and helpful. their menu can be a little overwhelming because it is unorganized but the staff was very kind and gave me suggestions. The shop is out of my way but whenever i get the chance to be remotely close to to Moga's its definitely my first choice."}
{"text":"We ordered two extra large pizzas and were told to pick them up after 20-25 minutes. We go there and proceeded to wait an extra 20 minutes. Customers around us were getting fed up and leaving. To top it all off, they got one of our orders wrong.   I don't mind waiting, don't get me wrong. I would just like to be informed. If you quote me 25 minutes, don't just say \"10 more minutes\" until it means something. None of the staff seemed particularly interested in customer service, not even offering a sorry or free drink. Absolutely atrocious services, but good pizza."}
{"text":"Unfortunately for this location, the staff are rude when serving customers , and as a pizza location , I wouldn't say that it offers competitive deals, and usually more expensive than pizza pizza , and dominos etc"}
{"text":"We ordered a half veggie and half tandoori chicken pizza. We also ordered garlic bread. The chicken pizza was just spicy enough to not be overwhelming which was good. The garlic bread was really tasty and well done. The only issue I had was with the excess ginger/garlic masala that shifts taste away from the chicken. Everything else was above satisfactory."}
{"text":"So my wife and i bought a house in Brampton and i remember when i was in school there was a pizza place and a Indian Sweet place called Moga Sweets and Moga Pizza. I did some research and moga is a city and district in Punjab. Anyways My wife and i moved to Brampton and we wanted some Pizza and surprise Moga pizza right by my house (i shouldn't be too surprised as about 80% of the population in my area is of Punjabi descent). Anyways the Pizza was awesome,  we usually get 2 larges for under $20 (Veggie, or all dressed) its a popular place for the locals so the wait might be a few Min's, better to order ahead of time."}
{"text":"Dont let the low prices fool you, their quality is really good. What separates this place is that their dough taste fresh. The dough is nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy and moist on the inside. I find the nearby big chain stores to be very dry. Also they give a nice portion of cheese compared to the others.   Definitely great value."}
{"text":"Worst customer service by the staff. Ordered a pizza and chicken wings combo. Combo says 20 wings and extra large pizza along with wings. However after payment, we brought the food home and to our surprise, there were just 12 wings and those too looks like malnutritioned ones. Called them up and they asked us to come all the way back to store. To our second surprise, they handed us just 8 more wings. We asked them to keep them and enjoy and we walked out. On reaching home, they call us back, asking us to come back to pick 20 wings. We asked them to either deliver them or enjoy. They simply backed out. Worst customer service. Not sure if we can upload the picture of wings. Will try.   Another instance faced someone else. They ordered medium pizza for around 7 dollars n without confirming, paid using visa and came home. Later in monthly statement, he observed he has been charged 24 dollars. Thats lame. Couple more people reported the same.   I would any time say NO to them."}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering pizza here. I ordered pizza,wings and garlic bread . It was all great. The pizza taste great with lots of toppings on it. The wings taste so good. The garlic bread had so much cheese on it. I will be going back ."}
