{"text":"Terrible food.  Completely incompetent staff.  We were sitting on the top floor, waiting for our food.  We waited.  And waited.  We watched a couple at a table on the patio downstairs arrive, order, receive their food, and leave.  All in the meantime they'd only brought us water, soft drinks, and a salad - which was one of the worst, droopiest salads I've ever had.  Finally, the waitress arrives and told us they had run out of what we'd ordered - this after having waited over an hour and a half.  She asked us if we wanted to order something else.  We didn't.  We left and would never go back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place less than 1 star. Terrible service, even worse food.  I was with a group of four, it wasn't busy at all and we waited 20mins to get a second beer and 45 mins to get pizza. My pizza had undercooked dough and yet the toppings were burnt. My friends pizza came out cold. One of the people with me said \"Maybe they don't know what pizza is supposed to be like\".   I can't believe I found a place that makes El Sol's service look fast."}
{"text":"Went early for dinner with the kids - the main attraction was the gluten-free pasta for our noodle monster. The menu, prices, and especially the food, kept me thinking that I was at a Kelsey's or some other chain casual grill. The caesar salad was ok, followed by pasta with pesto cream sauce and grilled chicken. The sauce was pretty bland, the pasta was overcooked as was the chicken.  The service was ok, although there was only us and one other table at the time."}
{"text":"Pre-fixed dinner = Pre-fixed crap.   Well, at least at this restaurant. In the past I have come here for lunch and have felt satisfied enough to come back- they would have had a 3 star if it was just based on that experience. This was the first time I came for a dinner and was truly dissatisfied. The pre-fix dinner included 1 appetizer and 1 entree. I chose the Bocconcini Pear Melt with (supposedly) a divine (according to the menu) balsamic reduction vinaigrette . It was a disaster. I would be embarrassed to let that leave the kitchen. It tasted and looked like canned pear.  They attempted to melt a completely tasteless bocconcini cheese on top with a droplet of balsamic vinaigrette. The cheese was like the texture of my finger. Just awful.   If things couldn't get worst my entree was the most rubbery, bland steak I have ever had in my life. The potatoes on the side were so dry that I did actually choke on them. The only good thing that I had at Nevada was the Shiraz. But - that is not enough to have me return. It is unfortunate because I really did enjoy the lunch I had in the past. But, once a restaurant loses touch with their food..they begin to lose touch with their reason for being."}
{"text":"After a day at the Beaches, top up your sunburn here on the patio, and enjoy some fresh dishes that are  a notch above the nearby pubs.   I'll forgive them for not having regular, unsweetened tea. You'd think that Toronto was the capital of South Carolina from all the sweet tea drinking. That aside, I was pleasantly surprised at the dishes.   My grilled salmon Ceasar salad featured a huge chunk of fish, blackened *just right*, tasting fresh as anything. With a bit of lemon, the salad was perky and savory.   My friend's \"chicken all the way\" confirmed that gorgonzola can do no wrong, and the creamy mushrooms added to the satisfaction.   Friendly, slow service. As a Sunday afternoon should be!"}
