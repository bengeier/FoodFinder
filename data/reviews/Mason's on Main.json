{"text":"It's great to have a nice restaurant in Oregon.  The food is great.  The atmosphere is wonderful.  It's amazing how they transformed the space.  Their beer selection is great!  The only problem I had with Masons was the service.  There were maybe a dozen people in the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon and the service was VERY slow.  Our waitress was obviously new to waiting tables and she didn't know her beers.  I really hope this was a fluke because otherwise, we really enjoyed our meal Masons. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I agree with the other posters that it's great to finally have a restaurant serving high quality food in Oregon.  The food was fantastic and the atmosphere as well. The service was good - you could tell that some were a little new, but understandable.   My problem is that we were there for our anniversary - one of our few nights out without the kids - and they ended up seating another couple at our table!! Are you kidding? I didn't pay $60 for dinner to eat with strangers when I'm on a date with my wife. Totally awkward. We had planned on dessert, but once that happened we just asked for the check and left."}
{"text":"Great prime rib and fantastic service.  Their menu is wonderful!!!  This is a place for any bar crowd.  Overall I highly recommend this place to anyone near Madison.  Only about 15 min outside downtown Madison!!"}
{"text":"Excellent all the way around.  Service was great even though it was packed, friendly hostess and waiter.  Menu is great with lots of unique, fresh items.  We ordered the perch and the shrimp and scallops - both were very good!    The remodel of the buildings is fantastic, with a great feeling and a great tie to Oregon history.  Definitely will return and will recommend."}
{"text":"We attempted to dine at the establishment on July 20th.   We entered the restaurant and were standing by the bar area when a waitress told us that we had to walk further in to be seated by the hostess. The hostess told us (once) that she'll be with us shortly, she checked something on the computer screen, told us (again) to give her one more moment as she checked with another waitstaff, and told us to wait one final time as she walked in to the dining area and came back. After three pauses, we were finally seated in the dining area.   We were offered the menu and water was poured, however that's then the service ended.  There was maybe 4 other tables in the dining area during the time we were there, the rest of the dining area was bare. We noticed there were at least 3 waitstaff folding silverware, a few waitstaff making rounds at other tables, and a few that mostly just stood around.   We sat for 20 minutes, waiting for someone to walk by, make eye contact with us, or just even notice us. To our disappointment, not by surprise, that none of those three events occurred.  During the 20 minutes, we had a chance to skim the menu. The selections were not impressive nor creative.   Since then, several neighbors, co-workers, and other acquaintances concur that service (or lack there of) is the main turn off of this restaurant.  I contacted the email address provided on their website on 07-29-13 and still have not heard a response as of yet.   I am saddened of the potential fine dining in a casual atmosphere restaurant had such inexcusable service. At this time, I cannot recommend this business to co-workers, friends, neighbors, or family until the management can operate a service restaurant. I am not certain I would even return here."}
{"text":"It's great to have a new restaurant in town, we will go back as we patronize the local businesses.  But Masons has to make some changes to be Oregon's high-end restaurant. Three of us went, partner and I took a friend. There is apparently a bar dining room and formal dining room. We had no preference and nobody told us there were both and we had to wait 20 minutes even though there were a number of open tables in front of us the entire time. Wait staff is young and inexperienced for high end. Wait staff kept apologizing that they were new and the kitchen was backed up - those aren't announcements high-end restaurants make to diners. Partner asked for catchup, she took from another table and gave to him dirty, it was passed to another table the same way. Soups were excellent, two meals were good but not superb, partner's rare hamburger was well done, dry and said one of worst burgers he has had. They've done a beautiful job on the building, now they have to bring up the service and quality to match what they are trying to do. Senor Peppers and DeBroux's have achieved the quality and service for what they are and are appropriately priced; you always leave both satisfied for what you paid. Masons needs to work toward this goal - quickly."}
{"text":"Finally a nice place in Oregon, lets hope it lasts....  We oredered the Blugill with Baby Reds and the Soup with Seafood Cakes.  Both entrees were terrific. I just couldn't find any fault with the food.  The service was very attentive without being overbearing.  The only thing I would like to change is that the seating was not overly comfortable."}
{"text":"Food was great. The bartender was great. Our waitress was attentive and there whenever we wanted her, but she was overly chatty and interrupted a lot. Dessert was OK, but the custard was a Jello mix. Restaurant intimate for a single or double date, but welcoming for a family of four."}
{"text":"We went in for dinner on the 4th of July so it wasn't super busy, being it was a Thursday and holiday.  There isn't really a good place where a hostess greats you, but someone got us seated right away.  Our server was very friendly and made great recommendations.  My husband had the fish platter, I got a small salad and we ordered cheese curds - the food was great.  We plan on going back again - we've heard mixed reviews from people in town but we had a good experience."}
{"text":"We had a gift certificate so we came here for our 7 year anniversary dinner. I was pleasantly surprised at the decor. The dining room was dimly lit and very intimate. It's a perfect place for a date night.   Prior to ordering, our server informed us the menu was changing tomorrow. Great... Guess we'll have what's on the old one. We started with the cheese curds. Wow! These might have been the best fried cheese curds I've ever had in my LIFE! Fresh light batter and creamy squeaky cheese curds. It came with a side of in house sauce. I wish I could say the same about the rest of the meal.   I had the \"jumbo\" scallops. Huge disappointment. The scallops were barely seared if at all. They were also sandy and not washed well. I've had jumbo scallops before and these guys must have been their little brothers. Only came with three... $26 for the plate.   My wife got the Mahi Mahi. This was also a disappointment. Lightly battered and served on top of butternut squash. It made it taste very sweet. The Brussels sprout side came shredded. Very strange and not tasty at all.   The seafood chowder was OK. I wasn't impressed with it either. The only other positive was we got a $10 of wine.   I'm giving it three stars mainly for the atmosphere and cheese curds. Hopefully the new menu is better. I might try it again."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. However:  extremely slow service, inept wait staff, disappionting food.  Restaurant needs better management and attention to diners' needs and food quality.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I dont even think its open anymore. .. I can understand why. Husband and I got a babysitter and went out to enjoy dinner. We got a table for two about a foot of room on either side of us from other tables. 4 minutes later The next group seated next to us had 3 kids in high chairs. The staff went to this table first. We waited until they got the drinks for that table. .. with still no service we decided to move.... mind you its 5:00 and there are 2 other parties in there. They move us to the bar right next to the window.  Bar was full and we had to wait.  Service bad Food lame Price expensive.  Would never go back even if it was open."}
{"text":"Heard about Mason's on Main from an online Restaurant website. Thought we would try something new - and we were glad we did.  Nice space with a split in half feel - formal dining room on one side and bar on the other. We opted for the bar area so we could keep an eye on the Brewer game - but both sides were very nice and would seem to work for both casual dining out or a more formal date or romantic dinner. A bit upscale but comfortable - but suits the upscale menu nicely.  We started with some Crab Cakes. Not your typical cakes but very good. We got two large cakes sitting on top of what looked like risotto - turned out to be crab meat in a remoulade or something. . . amazingly delicious! The crab cakes were good too - they were topped with a sauce as well so you didn't get that crunchy exterior you expect, but the taste was very good and the portion was good too.   Since we splurged on an appetizer - we both tried sandwiches for dinner. I had the Dry-Aged Angus Prime Rib Sandwich and my wife had the Mason's Reuben. Mine was ok, very messy and a bit hard to dip in the Au jus - plus it was supposed to come with a horseradish sauce, and I don't think mine did. The Reuben was good - very tasty. The only complaint was the corned beef was a bit stringy.   Overall we were very happy. We didn't have any of the service issues other reviews described. It did seem at times that our waitress was a bit overwhelmed running around, but she handled it well and took care of us."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service.  Bistro is casual and they have a formal dining room.  Great prices, selection."}
{"text":"I visit Mason's on Main about once a month for drinks and usually order food.  Half the time, I would give Mason's four to five stars, the other half I would give it two stars.  Last night was a two star visit.  Our drinks took an extraordinarily long time to arrive (the bar was not even half full, probably due to Oregon Summerfest and the fireworks).  The cheese plate was decent (the hazelnuts were amazing). However, the \"sharp cheddar\" hardly qualified as mild cheddar.  Come on, we are in Wisconsin--we are all experts on what sharp cheddar tastes like.  Don't waste my time with Colby-esque cheese masquerading as cheddar of any sort.  When the waitress brought us our bill, she emphasized that she was leaving soon.  We placed the credit card in the folder and then waited and waited.  And waited some more.  Finally, I took the bill up to the bar.  The bar tender seemed confused.  I explained our waitress seemed to have left.  Then the bar tender went on a search for our waitress.  More waiting.  She wasn't in the kitchen or dining room.  She wasn't out the back door.  Oh, she was watching the fireworks in front of the restaurant!  Of course, why didn't I look there myself?  Would have cut down on the waiting considerably.  Next time, I will just do self-service on the cash register.  My learning curve won't take any longer than this particular waitress.  I really do like Mason's and hope it is in business for a long, long time.  There are servers there who do an excellent job.  It's just this one particular server--when she waits on us, I can count on a weird experience.  Most of the food that I've had there is very good.  I'm glad they put up a hostess station, that helps clarify the confusion on how to access a table in the dining room.  I will be back.  I will just try to be more pro-active re: who waits on me."}
{"text":"Nice place good food. Fish fry is surprisingly good but sometimes a tad salty."}
{"text":"I dined at this establishment on 8/15/13 with my girlfriend. We love to patronize the local businesses in Oregon, and were very excited that a new place had opened up. They have done a great job remodeling this building, which is no easy feat with an old craftsman style building. We adored the interior and give Mason's a round of applause for that. When we arrived at the restaurant, there is only one entrance in, which is at the bar. There was some kind of a private party going on and the bar was pretty full. We stood on our toes to see where the hostess stand was, which we finally located at the far end of the bar. After pushing our way through the crowd, which can be daunting when people won't move, we made it and were promptly seated. Took a little while to get service, but the waitress was friendly and we ordered drinks and haystack onions to start. (I must say, the menu is a little overpriced for Oregon, in my opinion) The onions were extremely salty, so much so that we didn't finish the dish, which is unusual for me. Would not order this again. I ordered the lasgna special and my girlfriend ordered the cashew encrusted halibut. The lasagna came with veggies and two pieces of toasted bread. I thought the lasagna was pretty good, although they packed a bit too much cheese into it and again, it was pretty salty. My girlfriend did not enjoy here dinner. I tasted it and it was dripping with oil and again, way too salty. (See a pattern here?) I think they need to make some tweaks to the dining experience here and things will really be great. It is such a cool building and the people of Oregon will support them no matter what, but if they'd like to draw from Madison they need to make a few changes. 1. put the hostess stand in a more visible location 2. reduce the salt and oil amounts in the food 3. train the waitstaff to be a little quicker I hope to change this review to four stars soon."}
{"text":"Mason's on Main is a nice addition to the heart of Oregon. We have visited numerous times. The bar is lovely. The seafood bisque is my favorite item on the menu."}
