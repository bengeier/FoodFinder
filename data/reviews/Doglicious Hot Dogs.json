{"text":"I had the Chicago Dog w Coleslaw Generous toppings on the dog. The coleslaw was lightly dressed and both were delicious. Will definitely return.   Note: the restaurant shares a location with a Chevron gas station, convenience store and smoke shop."}
{"text":"Great place! Awesome menu, very friendly staff. Even non-hotdog menu options which I appreciated! I would recommend checking it out. I'm sure you'll go back. I know my family and I will"}
{"text":"Don't go anywhere else for hotdogs! 3 visits, 3 different hotdogs--all awesome!The buns are local and fresh too!"}
{"text":"Great hot dogs! Several flavors to try. You can also build your own flavor. Tried the New York and the brat with the pretzel bun. The coleslaw is to die for. Very cool place for your comfort food needs!"}
{"text":"Super Amazing service and outstanding dog choices! Don't leave without trying the Belgium Waffle dessert. Great joint to bring the family or just pop in for a quick bite."}
{"text":"AMAZING HOT DOGS AND IM NOT EVEN A HOTDOG PERSON!!! First off, who doesn't need a playful fun place for ...hotdogs? Still such a crazy idea. There is no place like this that I have ever been to in my life. I got the Mac attack dog. Do I need to say more? Mac n cheese, bacon, more cheese and this delish doggy sauce. Yummy chips or coleslaw go on the side. Next time I'll get a sauce with the chips, they really killed it with the doggy sauce. Id love to see what else they've got. AND CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE WAFFLES. the adorable little girls at the front made the dogs and this waffle which has sugar from Belgium in it. When you bite down, the waffle is soft and has magic little wisps of crunchy sugar. What a wimsical place...thank you for being in my life."}
{"text":"Place is AMAZING! Got the classic simple Chicago dog and it was delicious! Super fresh tasting! Girlfriend splurged and got the chili dog, she loved every bite! Buns are fresh and the chips are an added bonus! Try this place out!"}
{"text":"Great place. Clean, nice decor, friendly owners, high quality, exceptional and delicious hot dogs! Will not disappoint..."}
{"text":"Best hotdogs ever! Family owned business and very generous hosts! Orders are fresh made and taste delicious! I would highly recommend this place to all my family and friends and will be back to try more hotdogs!"}
{"text":"Very good! Great to have a local hot dog place. Very original menu choices and big portions. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Delicious hotdog. Had the columbian and didnt know what to expect while I was looking at it. But as soon as I ate it, it was absolutely delicious! It blended in my mouth and never overpowered the hotdog! I absolutely liked it and will come back and try the banh mi hotdog next time!"}
{"text":"Easily the best hotdog in town !!!! The Hawaiian  Hotdog was to die for !!!! I travel all over the world this will be a fav spot when in town !!!!"}
{"text":"I love Schreiner's sausage...and they have it here!  The buns are always fresh. It's family owned and operated, they take pride in their business, and it shows. I've eaten there and ordered to-go several times, I've explored the menu and have always enjoyed what I picked...I'm not a coleslaw lover but theirs is pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Found this on a business trip. Coleslaw is worthy of being on its own as a salad. Best Chicago dog I've had outside of long-defunct Mike's Red Hots (by Chicago natives) You owe it to yourself to try this place. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"My mom and I are usually pretty healthy eaters (salads, white meat, wild caught fish...yeah, we're \"those people\"), but we have a weakness for a good hot dog. We had a favorite place in central Phoenix when I lived downtown, but since I moved to the Glendale area, we were forced to find a new place to go to for our guilty pleasure. Lo and behold, this place came up on Yelp and had shining reviews.  We decided to give it a try for lunch on my birthday. First of all, the menu selection was all tempting. I wanted to try one of each kind of hot dog, but I had to restrain myself. I got the Sonoran dog, which was juicy and full of flavor. I also went with half kettle chips and half coleslaw...neither one disappointed.  The owner and his daughters only made my birthday experience even more memorable when they brought me a complimentary ice cream. Now, I worked at a coffee shop that served premium ice cream and this was exactly on par with what I would expect from such a description. It took my mom and I less than 3 minutes to devour it. My only wish is that I had enough room left in my tummy to try one of their Belgian waffles.  Alas, there will be another day.  I plan to return with my mom, as it's the perfect halfway point between our houses, the food is delicious, the service is friendly, the prices are fair, and you can get a photo of you wearing a hot dog costume. I mean, if that doesn't sell you, what will?"}
{"text":"Hidden gem, this place has so much variety and delicious options. My first time here and I'm very glad to have found a real hot dog place."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time.  Best Italian beef sandwiches I have ever tasted.  The owners are extremely nice.  I also tasted the Sonoran hotdog and the waffle dessert which was also great tasting. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"A quaint little place for a quick meal. Hard to find because they do not have the traditional overhead sign. It's to the left (west) of the Chevron convenience store. The employees were nice enough. It was perfectly clean inside and the decor was a bit of a shock because from the outside, you wouldn't expect there to be such a modern look.  I got the Sonoran dog, which had a lovely presentation. A bit difficult to eat with all the juices and toppings falling off, but I managed with copious amounts of napkins. The salsa and Mexican cheese was delicious, but I think I would hold off on the nacho cheese and beans next time so I can enjoy the taste of the hot dog a bit more.  Overall, worth a visit and the menu invites you to try all of the interesting toppings at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place and were very satisfied. I had the Sonoran dog and he went with the Hawaiian. Both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love their dogs and the cole slaw is fantastic! Clean and friendly....a definite thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! All I have to say is the reviews don't lie!! I had the Aloha Hawaiian Dog and it was incredible not mention the cold slaw! I will most definately be back! I have at least 8 more dogs to try ;)"}
{"text":"Great selection. Something a little different is always good and this place has mastered it. Flavors like cola braised onions and dr. Pepper braised pulled pork along with 20 different hotdogs. Try the waffle. The ice cream is a butter fat ice cream. Amazing."}
{"text":"The best hot dog place in the West Valley. Tons of creative and delicious styles and options as well as sandwiches, waffles, and ice cream! Family owned and operated and it shows in the service and attention to detail. I've finally found my go-to hot dog spot."}
{"text":"It was so good. Between us we got the pork sliders, the big Texan and the Seattle all with  the coleslaw. The staff was friendly and the food was priced right. All the buns were toasted. They were out of their Belgian waffles so we will have to come back to try them."}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to spot, just behind Chevron station, excellent food ,plenty of choices and the people there are very friendly and customer oriented . Got the chili cheese dog and slaw, yummy . Ed S."}
{"text":"Hands down the best hot dog place in the state! Fantastic customer service and very welcoming atmosphere. It's really nice to see a family run business ran so well. Thank you Doglicious Hot Dogs!"}
{"text":"I thought the food here was great! I'm a displaced Chicago native and their Chicago Dog is completely authentic. Would strongly recommend to anyone looking for a real Chicago dog, please give them a try."}
{"text":"Very fair prices, good food, friendly involved owners. Had the macho nacho dog and the cowboy dog. Chips with both, but able to choose between chips and Cole slaw."}
{"text":"We used Uber Eats and also tried this restaurant for the first time. We are super impressed. The food was excellent!  We ordered: Aloha Dog Coney Dog Chicago Dog Italian Beef Sandwich side of pulledpork Kids Meal  LOVED everything but the pulled pork. There was not enough sauce on it and they put chopped onions on it. We tried a couple bites and my husband and I did not like it.  But everything else was GREAT! We will definitely order here again.  Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Small family owned shop with good customer service. Delicious dogs; it is correctly named. I'd recommend going even if you aren't a hot dog fan."}
{"text":"Really good hot dogs for a fair price . The location is a little hard to find next to the gas station, but so worth it. The family who runs the place is adorable and so friendly."}
{"text":"The hot dogs are high quality and they put a good amount of thought into their creations. We split 4 dogs and enjoyed them all. We had the \"Who's Rueben?\" The Mac Attack. The Sonoran and The Philly Cheese Steak. The dogs are each served with chips or slaw. The chips are fine. Nothing remarkable. But the slaw is good. Different people have different slaw preferences. We liked theirs because it's not too saucy. We also tried the \"air fries.\" I presume this is an alternative to having to have a full-blown fryer and all the gas and ventilation equipment that requires ($$$!). The fries were surprisingly good. If I didn't know they were \"air fries\" I wouldn't have thought anything about it. The atmosphere is pretty bland and they could do a little better with seating. But we enjoyed the food and will be back to try some other options."}
{"text":"Was getting my car detailed when I decided to walk over and try this place out. I just went with the Polish dog, and it was phenomenal. One of, if not the best Polish dog I've ever had. I saw a picture of the Mac-N-Cheese dog and definitely will be back to try that out. In fact I'll probably stop in every time I'm getting my car cleaned and several more times between that. Definitely try this place out, especially if you love a delicious hot dog."}
{"text":"WOW!....I love good hotdogs! And after reading an article in the news yesterday and checking out their Yelp scores/reviews the kids and I decided to check out a new Hot Dog joint on the west side near 51st Ave & Bell called DOGLICIOUS. It was F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C!  There's about a dozen varieties of dogs, or you can create your own. The owners are very friendly & talkative and were proud to tell me that everything there is home made. The rolls are fresh made every day at a local bakery. Yes...the roll itself was THAT good! Of course the toppings are unique and terrific too! The \"Beer Chili\" I had on my Coney was killer and I almost ordered a side of it afterwards just because!  They've also got a couple other things on the menu if you don't want a dog!   I've never had a Hot Dog like the ones at this place. They are UPPER LEVEL!"}
{"text":"We have gotten takeout from this place a few times. Really great service and interesting combinations of toppings. I think the quality of ingredients isn't the best, but everything is tasty and it is our go to spot when we are in the mood for a hotdog."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Love coming here, super friendly owners, and it's a local small business!! Crazy selection of hot dogs, plus you can always build your own = )! Definitely recommend coming here if you want a quick delicious bite!!!"}
{"text":"Nice little hidden gem next to a gas station.  Wish this place was in downtown Phx.  Eventually I want to try everything.  Definitely a place everyone needs to eat at if they feel like a dog.  You guys would make a killing at Chase Park."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of hot dogs  and everything i have tasted so far was amazing. The Sonoran dog being the best. I will surely order from here again."}
{"text":"Delicious place! So many amazing dogs to try, can't wait to go back and try more. Aside from hot dogs, there are also salads, sliders, and Belgian waffles (amazing!). Several unique toppings and combinations, or you can build your own and choose your own toppings, very cool. It's set up so you can see all the toppings and watch it being made. I got a classic Chicago dog which had lots of snap and amazing flavor, and my husband got the Texas BBQ dog which had pulled pork and beans among other toppings and he loved it. Great value- it's a filling meal and super delicious!  The food is very fresh and the atmosphere is very clean and inviting....the owners were also extremely nice and made sure everything was up to par. Thank you! Great concept, can't wait to come back and tell others about this gem."}
{"text":"Delicious; and I don't even like hot dogs. Lol. But I'll be back for the Seattle dog!!"}
{"text":"First timers and they were great! Affordable, plenty of options and even build your own! We'll definitely be back! Yummy hotdogs!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place on one of those, 'I want something but don't know what' cravings. Very good! Tried the Sonoran hotdog-delicious. House made chips too."}
{"text":"Had to check it out as I live around the corner... this place is amazing great quality dogs and home made hot dog buns. The menu is outta control with a verity of options to choose from. Family owned and operated these guys care and you can tell. A little hidden gem in Glendale!"}
{"text":"This place is great. One of the best Chicago dogs I've ever eaten (no I've never been to Chicago or New York). But for a Arizona native , the best in AZ. My girlfriend hAd the Mac dog and throughly enjoyed it, enough to cover her face in it. Not to mention the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Disappointed that we live 30 minute away but might be worth the drive if I'm looking for some amazing gourmet hotdogs. We will return for sure, specially if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious and creative hot dogs! Many different types of dogs including bratwurst; and lots of fresh toppings. Service was great. This is an awesome family owned shop that was an all around hit with my family of 5 boys!"}
{"text":"Let's remember I ONLY review places that earn 5 stars, and this is it!  Doglicious Hot Dogs is old school meets new with 24 specialty dogs, salads, sliders, pulled pork, and more. The atmosphere is AZ shorts and flip-flops über casual.  Stop by or have it delivered by GRUBHUB."}
{"text":"Good choice on many flavors of hotdogs and sliders. A small ma and pop place. Located as part if gas station. Service is good also. Downfallb is there is no large sign that tells people that they are there. There is painted stuff on window but from a far it looks jumbled.  They need a sign to bring in more customers"}
{"text":"Excellent hotdogs! Lots of toppings, including some special and traditional styles like Chicago, New York, etc. very reasonably priced, family owned, and very clean. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"West Side--- there is a new hip joint in town! We're talking the real foodie fad... Gourmet Hot Dogs! Not the tiny, wanna-be type... the real deal.  Clean, modern, hip and inviting place! Owners are very friendly, and make wonderful recommendations. There are TONS of options for variety, and several high quality signature dogs that look amazing! (The Sonoran Dog was awesome, as was the Belgian waffles - which you can dress up with delicious toppings) The sides are perfectly paired for a hot dog. You can eat there, or they'll pack everything up nicely for take out.   It's evident that everything is fresh, and no cheap ingredients are used. The buns are baked daily, and are fantastic!   Foodies, you will be very happy to check this place off your bucket list- and you'll come back wanting more! I wouldn't have considered myself a gourmet hot dog lover, until I ate here. By far the best hot dogs around!"}
{"text":"Great hot dogs, great pricing and excellent service! Such a cute shop with so many options! We'll definitely be back - the Chicago dogs and kettle chips were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Many options for hot dogs a sliders. Great price for authentic hot dog and seasoned kettle chips. Very friendly and courteous people."}
{"text":"Stopped in her the other day after soccer practice to get a quick lunch.  Love that the kids were working at the counter taking orders....small business are the best!!  I had the Sonoran dog, and it was really good.  Bacon, a snappy vienna beef hotdog and other toppings...only problem is I had to use a fork after the first bite, it got a little soggy, but the flavor was on point!!  Family had the mac attack - hoffy, bacon and mac and cheese .  It was good, but the mac seemed a little shy on the salt.   Not sure what the difference is between a hoffy dog and vienna, but I liked the snap of the vienna more, the hoffy had a chewy casing.  The side of kettle chips is just the icing on the cake.  Served warm, it was hard not to start with those.  We will be back, there are many items to try on the menu."}
{"text":"Great for creative dogs. A huge selection to choose from, or create your own. The presentation is great, and pretty tasty. Family run, and friendly vibe. Will come back. I told the owners to expand to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. It would fit perfectly there too."}
{"text":"Its locates next to a gas station so I was a little hesitant at first but when you walk in the decor and cleaniness make you forget about the gas station, I ordered the pizza dog and my husband the Senora dog both were very tasty i was in the mood for fries but their machine was down so we got chips instead, the Senora dog definitely wasnt authentic so if your in the mood for one this isnt the place but their take on it was good :)"}
{"text":"Epic...the sliders are amazing and the staff is very genuine and helpful. They definitely take pride in there craft."}
{"text":"Not only are the hot dogs amazing but the owner is incredibly kind. While we were waiting for our order to he done a gentleman walked in and asked if he could have a hot dog for free because he hadn't eaten all day. Instead of turning him away, he made him a hot dog. It was awesome to see a business owner be so generous! One more reason to keep coming back to this tasty spot!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Place is very simple inside, but very clean! Quality hot dogs and buns used- and had lots of great, fun, and tasty options to choose from. I had the \"Mac attack\" ( Mac and cheese w/ bacon).... AWESOME. Also, we got the air fries with house seasoning which were also very delicious. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"So i have waited to post this rating as my husband really wanted me to give it 5 stars because he LOVED it.  The food was delicious and lots of it.  I always appreciated and support local businesses.   Pro: family owned business. The menu has a great selection and all the food taste fresh, especially the bun- they were soft. I loved the loaded kettle chips.  They were delicious!  The hot dogs have a crispy bite and are not salty.   Con: we were the only one in the dining area and all the tables were dirty.  The food prep area looked clean so A wipe down and sweep in the dinning area would keep it clean and make consumers for comfortable.  Too much toppings on the dogs.  I couldnt eat it with my hands, i had to use a fork and spoon as my dog and toppings fell through the bun.  All though still good, the Kettle chips are not made fresh at the shop, they are store bought."}
{"text":"We got a Yelp on our email about this hot dog place and decided to give it a try today and we were very pleased with the food and if your into loaded hot dogs then go here for it was fresh, flavorful with good service along with a reasonable price that we Will definitely be revisiting to enjoy a delicious gourmet hot dog We recently just revisited today after not be able to visit in about a year and we again were very pleased with our choices and the quality to which we plan to visit and eat here more often and recommend people to give this place a try if you enjoy a good hot dog..."}
{"text":"I got the Sonoran hot dog and it was delicious! A dad and his daughter were working while I was here, and they are both so friendly and talented! The hot dog was amazing- I'll definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"So good! So good! So good!  Our first time and we loved it! So many options! Very fulfilling and serving size is perfect. Can't go wrong with the Cheesy Beer Chili Dog or the Loaded Sonoran!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Best hot dogs in town. Super friendly and family owned. I walked in today and the owner had his daughters helping, they were so sweet too. I love that all the dogs are the same price, it's very reasonable and hits the spot for sure. Let's get these guys on Diners Drive-inns and Dives!!!!"}
{"text":"Best ever! Famil ran, and owned, these guys don't skimp on quality.  Loads of fixings, dog choices, and FRESH FRESH FRESH. fresh bread, chilli, cole slaw, even the kettle chips are fresh made. Build your own, or pick one of their specialty dogs. You won't leave hungry, or disappointed"}
{"text":"I am not usually a hot dog fan but my boyfriend was craving one today so we chose this place. I love that it is family-run and the options are plentiful! They even have waffles with a wide selection of toppings. I ordered a plain Vienna hot dog with a coney bun and mustard. Wow!! The meat was excellent and the bread was even better! My boyfriend ordered two hot dogs with lots of different toppings and ended up with two meals (which is rare for him). The little girl (maybe age 13) who took my order really knew the menu and had incredible customer service. Actually the service was top-notch from everyone there, I was just particularly impressed with the service skills of the girls. Good job! We will be back! I want to try a Chicago dog next time."}
{"text":"We didn't realize this place was right down the street from us until we found it on Yelp. I love trying local mom and pop places. We had trouble finding it because it is attached to the gas station. The owner and his daughter were working when we went. They made the place warm and inviting. We tried the New Yorker, Mac attack, beef slider and waffle. All very good and like nothing else we have had in this part of Phoenix. A new local gem!"}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant as many stars as you could give and then double them. The food here is so incredibly good! Each hot dog is a piece of art made lovingly by the owners. The bread is fresh, the cole slaw and chips are fantastic, the menu offers amazing options and the prices are very reasonable. Every time I eat here I sit and plan my next visit and order. The atmosphere is great and the owners work very hard to ensure that each guest has a great dining experience. Best hot dogs I have ever eaten! Gotta get the Sonoran, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Tucked away next to a gas station is a nice little hot dog heaven. They have a huge variety of toppings to choose from and different types of dogs to go with them. Only problem i have is the price is kind of high for a hot dog."}
{"text":"I was hungry for a yummy Sonoran dog and drove about 30 mins away to try it. Was empty when I got there and the prices were a bit high. My kids had the mac n cheese and chips and hot dogs that were shaped as octopus. My kids didn't finish the mac n cheese and I tried it and was really bland. It was hot and stuffy inside and my Sonoran dog was alright. I ordered a waffle with strawberries and whip cream and wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Great family oriented place had something for everyone and the food was excellent who knew hotdogs could be so delicious"}
{"text":"Eh it was ok. Toppings were better than the hot dog. The meat was strange, think some sort of combination with beef. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Eaten here 4 times never had a bad meal. Chill atmosphere friendly staff. Would reccomend to anyone that likes hotdogs."}
{"text":"This place is so Good. We tried the Chicago, pizza, Ruben and the chilli slaw along with an Italian beef slider. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best service, best hot dogs, overall experience from the time we walked in to the time we left was absolutely amazing. I took my fiancé there for his birthday and they even surprised him with a cute little ice cream cup! This place is truly so delicious and I will continue to go there to experience all the hot dogs available! We ordered 4 during this visit and I'm so excited to continue to try the many others."}
{"text":"This is definitely going to be an annual spot to visit when we're in AZ for spring training. We ordered the Cowboy, the Loaded Sonoran, a slider and waffle with nutella, vanilla bean ice cream, caramel sauce with a dash of cookie butter...HOLY COW...so good!!!!! The 5 star reviews on this spot are spot on. It's family run with great, friendly service. Our food was ready super quick, and everything was fresh and tasty. I don't think I can eat a hot dog on any average bun ever again. Heading back tomorrow for a waffle :)"}
{"text":"Top notch! The food is wonderful but the family running it, makes it even better!"}
{"text":"Awsome cool new place to eat great food! I never imagined there could be so many kinds of hot dogs!  They have really good deals on two dogs/ kettle chips of your choice for under $10.00 bucks!    This is a great restaurant to try new delicious food and meet neat people! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who in joys quality food."}
{"text":"This family owned and operated business is a great find in the northwest valley for delicious hot dogs and sliders. The menu is pretty extensive for hot dogs and each item includes a choice of homemade coleslaw or kettle chips.  My wife and I have visited twice this week for lunch...what I absolutely love is the all beef dog in a natural casing (hard to find in the valley) that has that \"east coast snap\" when you bite into it.  The toppings are generous and very fresh. My wife enjoyed her chili & slaw dog which was delicious. The place lacks ambiance (located in a gas station lot) but the food is a killer and well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try Doglicous Hot Dogs from a friends suggestion On social media.  This place is outstanding.......you eat with your eyes first. You will not be disappointed. I ordered the Chili cheese dog $6.75 and my wife tried the BLT dog $6.20........all I can say is WOW..... The buns were so tender and the fries (air Fried)  are so delicious, the meats were very, very good. They do not skimp on their dogs. This store is Family owned and operated. Also very clean, service was exceptional. I urge all who read this to try these Dogilicious Dogs.  It is on the corner of 51st ave and Bell Road behind the Exxon/Chevron station.....will definitely be back.......I would actually give this place 10 stars......"}
{"text":"Just got done eating the most delicious dog in AZ! I was greeted by the family once I entered which were incredible welcoming. This is by far the best hot dog shop I've ever been to. You definitely need to try the Columbian Dog!!"}
{"text":"KILLER CHICAGO DAWG!!! Made this still World Series happy Cubs fan feel like home. The toppings were exactly how they're supposed to be......AND WITHOUT KETCHUP!!!! We don't ever use ketchup in the Windy City and few places understand that simple concept. Doglicious does. Definitely returning to try the many other interesting hot dog selections. Well done fellas!!"}
{"text":"I love a great Chicago style hot dog and they make an amazing one.  The coleslaw is to die for.  Drive slow because you may drive right past it as it hidden by the Gas Station. Yummy"}
{"text":"Not a huge hot dog fan myself but this is one of those places that you just cannot resist. If you even remotely like hot dogs you will love this place. I don't really like hot dogs and I STILL love this place. Very reasonably priced, amazing hot dogs, super friendly service (family run little place) and a huge selection of gourmet dogs, everything from a Hawaiian Dog, to a Philly Cheese Dog, to a Seattle Dog, to- check out the menu, lots of different dogs! And their home made cole slaw and chips are fantastic as well.   I highly recommend this place! Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and great service. Super mom and pop feel to it, which I love!!! Amazing variety and unique flavors."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and have been living in Arizona for almost two years. This place has really good Chicago style hot dogs. It's the best I've tasted in AZ."}
{"text":"I tried the columbian hotdog and i love it Sweet and savory a very well made hotdog It's not too greasy nor salty enough to make you feel like killing yourself  Love it A very loving family with an awesome costumer care Come and give this place a try Support the local business Will be coming back"}
{"text":"They know how to make a true chicago dog, but the actual execution is less than great. My trip to this joint was mixed at best. I ordered a chicago dog with chips. The first thing I noticed was the inordinate amount of condiments. The just put too many on the dog. The dog was quality meat and just barely warm enough. The big mistake was the bun. It is a correct poppy seed bun, but very dry and falls apart when you eat the dog. It might not have been steamed properly. The chips were crunchy and well seasoned. The bottom line is that Portillos makes a better chicago dog every visit. In fact there is a hot dog guy at the home depot parking lot at 67th and bell that makes a better dog. Go there for half the price."}
{"text":"Don't normally eat too mny hot dogs, but sounded good and was up for something new.  Really friendly family, clean and professional. Tasty for a little fix and lots of menu options in addition to custom stuff of course.  Would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Fantastic hot dogs, great snap when you bite into any of there creative and tasty dogs. We had a great conversation with the owner who treated us to this fantastic waffle, vanilla bean ice cream desert - no charge. Very tasty!  Place is clean and lightly and appropriately decorated.   I've lived in AZ for 18 years and this is the best hot dog and overall experience we've had to date. Having it for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Dogilicious is awesome! The service is excellent and the food is amazing. Large variety of hot dogs and sides. Vegetarian options are available. The Loaded Sonoran Dog is out of this world! The coleslaw has a really great black pepper sauce. The Mac Attack Dog is awesome! The fries are light and crispy."}
{"text":"No pictures this time, was too hungry and could not resist eating the Sophia's Choice. Fantastic dogs, this is our third time here!"}
{"text":"Yum! We were on this side of town today and needed a quick, inexpensive lunch. This place was such a cool find. Had the texas and sonoran. So stinkin good. Messy...but soooooo worth it!"}
{"text":"One of the best hotdogs I have had in Arizona!  Love the family orientation feel as well as the delicious combinations that can be delivered.  Would not be surprised if I happen to see this establishment on the food network!"}
{"text":"I've seen this place driving back home,  so today for lunch I decided to try it.   And believe me,  all the positive reviews are valid. I ordered the Colombiana,  and not only was a huge hot dog,  but the combination of flavors were great.  I was one happy camper,  and will go back,  there are so many others i want to try now."}
{"text":"By now I've been there twice. I'm surprised I had not found this place before. I love their La Columbia Dog the best, refreshing taste with perfectly baked buns. And it's some close to ASU west campus and the Thunderbird School. Good place to have lunch. And I like it's small family business atmosphere."}
{"text":"We just tried Doglicious for the first time and WE LOVED IT!! Such great hot dogs, the service was great and the little girl that took our order so very very nice and helpful for us first timers. See you guys soon!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and I have to say its gonna be my new fave for hot dogs. Service was great. The staff were friendly and prompt.  So many choices of dogs but I settled on the Reuben and my father had a coney. We were both very happy with what we got. Great portions for great value. Im definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Seriously good. This restaurant clearly doesn't need more 5 stars but they deserve them. Incredible family business with a great focus on customer service. I called 3 hours after my meal, realizing I forgot the receipt which was needed for business. No problem, one phone call and 60 seconds later and I had it in my email inbox. The owner even asked me to check before we ended the call. The food was exceptional as well. You simply can't come to Phoenix without stopping for a hotdog!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the best hot dogs in the valley. It's kind of hidden next to a gas station and doesn't look like much from the outside, but upon entering you are greeted by the wafting aroma of fresh cooked 100% beef goodness (and all the condiments your heart could imagine)! The only thing warmer than the buns holding these wieners is the smile of the owners. They're super sweet! Much like the fresh relish. Personally, I had the La Columbiana hot dog and it was savory candy melting in your mouth. The menu is extensive and right when you think you've made your choice, another option entices you. The only solution is to come back time and time again until you've tried them all."}
{"text":"Exactly what a Chicago hot dog should be! Lots of other interesting twists on a hot dog to choose from. Cole slaw is unique with a peppery dressing. The restaurant is clean, but hard to spot because it is behind the Chavron fueling canopy."}
{"text":"This place is a must try. They have Amazing hotdogs. My new favorite place for super casual dining . The loaded SONORAN and chili cheese are the best. Very nice owner and staff. They even came over to see how we were all doing. And you must try the Cole slaw. It's phenomenal . Can't wait to bring friends here ."}
{"text":"Excellent hot dogs! The buns are out of this world. Travelled 15 minute to try it because my son requested a good hot dog! So glad we came. The salads are fresh too!"}
{"text":"Amazing hot dogs. I had the classic Chicago & my dinner date had a cheesy chili dog. Quick and cheap!  Slightly Hidden behind the chevron station.  They advertise Belgium waffles but we didn't try them."}
{"text":"This is the type of place Guy Fieri would bring his show to.  Please don't Guy, I don't want a big line next time I'm here.  Picture an indoor hot dog joint attached to a suburban gas station that also sells homemade Belgian waffles.  Yeah, that's easy to picture, right?  This family run operation is a terrific value for anyone looking for a quick lunch fix here or on the go.  Seeing the awesome early Yelp reviews, I grabbed a caravan of co-workers for lunch here on a Friday.  Being that this is a gas station restaurant there's pretty limited seating (maybe 20-25) and much of that is bar seating in the back.  We found just enough this go around as we beat most of the big lunch rush.  The menu here is of course dominated by the myriad of hot dog options (Chicago, Seattle, Kansas City, New York, Mexico and other regions are well represented on the menu in particular).  That said there are also salad options, beef sliders with a number of different possible meat and topping combos, and yes, Belgian waffles.  It makes no sense, but let's do it.  For my first go around here, I went with the Mac Attack Dog.  And yes, that does mean mac and cheese (and lots of it) as well as nacho cheese, ketchup, and bacon all piled on the sausage.  You get the option of chips or coleslaw with your hot dog (I went coleslaw).  Deciding to make my waffle my dessert for this meal, I went with a waffle topped with Nutella and whipped cream (they have about a dozen different waffle toppings to choose from).  Total cost for the hot dog, waffle, bottled water, and tax came to about $11.  Food came out about 5 minutes later.  The hot dog itself was awesome and man do they pile those toppings high.  My photo is not an exaggeration.  There's a ton of bacon and cheese on this thing.  The bacon was crispy and the cheese was melted perfectly.  The macaroni itself could've used a little more heat as I like my mac as hot as the cheese, but a forgivable offense.  I had to use a knife and fork around the edges of this thing before I dared pick it up with my bare hands.  But once I bit into all those layers at once, pure heaven.  Yes, the hot dogs here are messy, but with this much good stuff piled on top, who cares?  The coleslaw was a nice cool refreshing balance to the meal.  I would've been totally fine if my meal had ended right there.  Ah, but then I'd miss out on the waffle.  The batter for this waffle was much sweeter than your typical breakfast waffle and a lot denser as well.  Even though the waffle isn't too big (about the size of my hand), its dense enough and the toppings copious enough that the portion was plenty satisfying.  So yes folks, the solid reviews here are legit.  Great meal and a great value.  It's not as wild and crazy as Short Leash but the quality here is strong enough that they don't need to do anything way outside the box.  That said, I deeply enjoyed the waffle so I strongly encourage them to keep that outside the box thinking alive and well.  So if you find yourself near the intersection of 51st Ave and Bell, pull into the Chevron station on the northeast corner and look for the small hot dog restaurant on the westernmost part of the building.  Chances are your taste buds will end up as gleeful as mine."}
{"text":"This place takes gourmet hotdogs to a whole new level. They are family owned so of course the customer service it outstanding but the experience is unlike anything I've ever encountered. By far the best Hotdog I've ever eaten in my life! This is now my new favorite place. (Try the waffles!) :)"}
{"text":"Man bites dog . . . and loves it!    As usual, Yelp led me to this place. Hard to ignore a five star hot dog place and I could no longer the tractor beam of goodness pulling me in.   Of course I had the Princess with me and it was lunch time, a Beautiful Saturday in the 'hood. The P deferred the lunch decision to me and I made a bee line to Bell and 51st Ave, NE corner (Chevron gas station).  Huge menu of dogs and sliders. I thought I read that the portions were small so I got two dogs- the portions are Not small so I was stuffed when I rolled out but I got a chance to review two dogs for you! (Small sacrifice).   Ordered a \"naked dog\" and a Sonoran dog. I ate the naked dog first and almost took the Sonoran back to see if I could get another naked-hands down one of the best dogs I've ever eaten. Absolutely perfect (and inexpensive too, $3.75 and comes with a side of great chips or slaw. I'm about to go on a naked dog diet. Yee haw!  Sonoran dog was delicious also, a little more involved but excellent flavor profiles. Highly recommend this place. As others have pointed out, family run operation and hard not to appreciate their dedication to succeed and provide a great experience. Well done!"}
{"text":"Awesome hotdogs next to a gas station!? Yes!! SO MUCH YES!! This cute, small, family owned hot dog joint is the real deal. Any kind of topping you could possibly ask for.... its here!! From sweet dogs, to savory, and every in between.  This interior was super cute. Lots of white and green. Very modern looking.   They have Belgium Waffles for dessert. We did not get a chance to try them this time around but I will be trying them very soon. They looked awesome.   The family who ran the place was there, taking orders, ringing you up, and making your dog. They were super freiendly and made sure you were enjoying every bite. I highly recommend coming and cheching this joint out."}
{"text":"Very good quality food. Fresh baked buns are amazing! Fast and friendly service. We tried 4 different hotdogs amongst us. The chili slaw dog, the Loaded Sonoran, the Colombian, and the Philly Steak. All were good. The giardiniera was spicy on the philly, so if you don't like spicy, ask to leave it off. We also tried the liege waffle. Thought it was good but wish the strawberry was fruit not syrup. We loaded it up with the ice cream and whipped cream - well worth it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome as always! It's nice to go to a place where the owners truly appreciate your business and have great food. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good hot dogs. Lots of options. I would like my hot dog cut in half lengthwise just because I'm not big on hot dogs."}
{"text":"Tried Doglicious for the first time today. I will definitely be a repeat customer! We tried the mac attack and Cowboy dogs. Both were excellent. The chips were great. The owners were so friendly and helpful and the restaurant was clean and welcoming. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We loved our hot dogs and polish dog.  Super yummy and tons of different dogs to choose from."}
{"text":"I'm not really a hot dog fan, but since my boyfriend found this place I really like them!  This is a family run restaurant and the owners are very friendly and nice. The quality of these hot dogs are amazing and fresh. Every single time I go there, I try a different hot dog and I am never disappointed. I see a lot of reviews mentioning high prices. It's $5.95 for a hot dog made with really fresh ingredients, stacked high and will fill you up along with either a bag of chips or a side of coleslaw. I don't mind paying $6 for a hot dog here because they're worth it and pretty much a meal in itself."}
{"text":"Best Chicago dog I've ever had!! Definitely going back and telling everyone I know and plus it's close to my house can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Such a great place to go to. My wife and I enjoyed the delicious hot dogs , she got the Mac and Cheese one and I got the Macho Nacho one. Both tasted amazing! The staff are extremely friendly, was asked how everything multiple times and asked if there was anything else we needed. We will becoming back for the service and for all the different hot dog styles!"}
{"text":"Love Doglicious! My family and I have had dinner here nearly every Saturday since we discovered the pace a couple months ago. The Aloha is my favorite, do yourself a favor and try it! Yummy, yummy in the tummy!"}
{"text":"Excellent hot dogs ranging from iconic varieties to tasty new creations. You can't go wrong with anything, really. Family owned/run businesses are the best. One member came out and asked us about our satisfaction - you can truly tell they take pride in their establishment. Decor leaves something to be desired, however I truly couldn't care less about decor in a fast-casual restaurant as long as the food is excellent, which it is. Please try this place - their bread is made fresh daily too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  We plan on going again soon! The slaw is amazing! And turns out pineapple on hot dogs is delicious!"}
{"text":"Asked to give me a recommendation, tried the Aloha dog with coleslaw. Fresh ingredients especially the onions were so fresh and sweet! Loved the house sweet sauce they put on the Aloha one. Parsley in coleslaw makes it so unique as well. Really liked it, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a hot dog lover but man did I love this place! I got the Sonoran dog and it was amazing. The bread was just the perfect consistency where it doesn't get too soggy but it catches some of the flavor coming from the hot dog. The onions were fresh and crisp and the nacho cheese sauce oozy and delicious. My boyfriend got the Seattle and it had perfect proportions, topped with some sauce and three perfect pickled jalapeño slices. We ate in silence!! Best hot dog I've ever had. Definitely coming back here"}
{"text":"I will definitely be adding this spot into my lunch rotation. My group ordered a Chicago dog, New York dog, and Kansas dog.  I had the Chicago dog, and as much as I dislike saying that it was literally \"bursting\" with flavor..... It was seriously BURSTING with flavor.  I don't think I have ever scarfed food down as quickly as I did today. The pictures you see on Yelp/online are exactly what you are going to get we you receive your plate, and the staff (I'm assuming owner, his wife, and daughters) are as friendly and helpful as ever!! They also had a fitness center they are opening soon on deer valley and 17th ave)   My friend who is from New York ordered their \"New York dog\" and said it was pretty spot on. I didn't try it, but it definitely looked delicious!  Another co-worker ordered the Kansas dog.... Once again, looked amazing , and said she would order again.  Last thing I want to add...... I sent the menu to my co workers.... 145 people in my office, and I received numerous emails letting me know how rude I was for not letting everyone know earlier that I would be ordering lunch from Doglicious today. They all said that the food looked amazing. After seeing the food in person and hearing our thoughts, I have a list and a request to go again next week!  A++ Doglicious !!! We're in!"}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant. Seems family owned and the girls were very sweet. This is a great place to come for food if you're not looking to spend very much money. I would just recommend a sign, was a little difficult to find at first. The place is connected to the chevron."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in town!  Family owned, great service!"}
{"text":"Delicious hot dogs of every kind! Price is good! Food so impressed by hot dogs. Great service. Going to take some family y friends there for holidays. Try it,I almost missed this diamond in the rough. Would have been a big mistake by me. Happy Holidays y enjoy Delicious food is served here!"}
{"text":"we have gone twice first time was very good 2nd time over rated $18.00 for two hotdogs that were not very good fries were burnt and hard employees were not very friendly. the hotdog itself was good quality the way it was dressed was poor. this is not a great place its disappointing we tried it twice and not again"}
{"text":"Really great dogs! I had the New Yorker which is sauerkraut and spicy mustard and hubby had Chicago style. Slaw tasty also!"}
{"text":"Prompt, friendly service. I had the Coney dog. It was okay. It was lukewarm in the middle. Grilled dogs would have a better taste. The slaw was unusual. It had a rather dill taste. Decent meat chili. I wasn't impressed by the hot dogs or chili which is why I went. Maybe the other menu options are better. I expected more from the reviews."}
{"text":"I had a Chicago dog with the Cole slaw...very very good. Slaw had a nice tang to it and the dog was fresh and tasty. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Seattle dog was the bomb made with local sausage.Owners where very nice.  Thanks for lunch, Johnny dog"}
{"text":"So not only do you get a 2 specialty fog meal for $10... They are awesome! I went with a party of four and strong armed them into letting try all there different dogs, and the Italian beefs. Def worth the drive."}
{"text":"Love this place. With so many choices on the menu you can try each style of Hot Dog everytime you come. The Big Texas was really good. Gonna try the loaded Sonoran next time. Definitely a place you will like, if not love!"}
{"text":"Amazing hot dogs!!! Super juicy! I got the BLT DOG.... love it .... definitely will go back... it is my mission to try every hot dog."}
{"text":"Great place for great service! Loved the food and loved the family environment, not only in decorations, but with the family staff that works there! Super great family."}
{"text":"Kid friendly, creative dishes, flavor shots in the soda fountain. My issue here is that the hotdog on my BLT hotdog was rubbery. I ended up giving my dog the dog and eating the BLT on a hotdog bun. I will give this place another shot before writing it off completely as my kids loved it."}
{"text":"Great little place to stop by for a hot dog. They have a lot of crazy options to choose from all which seem like good combinations. I ordered a BLT dog and it was perfect. My fiance ordered a Mac attack dog which came with Mac n cheese n bacon. I had a bite of it and it was also very good. The fries are air fried which is a super nice change and I hope they don't move to real fryers.  Great seasoning too! All in all a great little place. Obviously a family ran joint and was kept clean with good service. A little on the pricier side but not bad overall. Plus it's real Vienna! Though who can expect to eat quality food for less then 20 for 2 in 2018? We managed here with two dog meals and a drink and I can honestly say I was full and content! I'll be back to try more of the crazy combos. Also as a side note the buns are split so it can get a bit messy. But it's a hot dog. Merica!"}
{"text":"Nice family restaurant to get your hotdog fix. I liked the variety of options they offer from traditional to well, not so much. I'm not a huge fan of hotdogs but sometimes you just get that craving and this place satisfied. My husband and I tried the Coney and the Seattle. Be prepared to get messy as it's hard to eat a meal here without getting food on your face etc. I would suggest this place update their signage; I didn't see this place for a long time even though I pass by it every day because you can't see it clearly from the road."}
{"text":"This place lives up to its name!   They make their own hot dog buns daily and they taste amazing!  Don't get scared when you when you pull up to the Chevron, Delicious Hot Dogs is an entirely separate unit. Go in, order a gourmet hot dog or build your own. I had the loaded Sonoran and my husband had the mac attack we also ordered a hot dog with ketchup only for the kids. Oh and they are served with chips or slaw. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Great menu, tons of hotdogs.  Really nice owner.  I'm looking forward I going again when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"What an awesome place my wife and I came here for lunch today we order the Colombian and Sonoran delicious we highly recommend them..!!!  The building was clean and the service on point we look forward to try something new next time."}
{"text":"Authentic Chicago dog spot in the West valley. Girlfriend had the chili dog and liked it as well"}
{"text":"We went out of our way to visit this place based on the reviews by others - we are glad we did.  The staff was extremely friendly.  The prices were well within reason for the great value received.  This place is worth a visit if you are a hot dog or brat lover like me.  We tried (4) different menu items, each excellent.  A few items are very original, and I thought I'd tried hot dogs just about every way one can think of.  We topped the meal with on of their Belgium Liege Waffles, and left both over-stuffed and thoroughly satisfied.  Will definitely be back to try the other 20+ dog/brat items on the menu and maybe a few of the other sandwich items.  Ask about the \"secret menu\" on arrival, there are a few things not necessarily published."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this delicious hot dog.You can taste the freshness in every bite. The place was super clean and great service."}
{"text":"Doglicious Hot Dogs is a small casual family owned restaurant located by a gas station. They offer a variety of All Beef Hotdogs of Vienna Beef Brand and Sabrett Brand along with many other offerings such as Authentic Belgian Waffles.  My husband had the Cheesy Beer Chili Dog. The hotdog inside the sandwich was luke warm and the Chili and Cheese Sauce were OK but not as flavorful as he imagined it would be. It was ok...and not bad....just ok.  I tried the Italian Beef Sandwich. The beef was tasty but this was a fail of a sandwich because Italian Bread is Essential to hold the juices. The bread used disintegrated and it was impossible to pick up or hold the sandwich. I also tried the cole slaw. It tasted good but was a very strange presentation with the dressing squirted on the top.  The hot dog was OK but really the Italian Beef I wouldn't recommend because you should be able to pick up a sandwich.  I will base my rating on the hot dog because this is a hot dog restaurant.  3 Stars means A-OK but I have some reservations."}
{"text":"Great Sonoran Hot Dog with homemade potato chips!  Lots of selections in the menu.  Family owned and operated.  Love supporting a business like this."}
{"text":"Nice little family run restaurant with great food. We had the classic Chicago Dog and Coney which were both fantastic. The family that runs the place is charming as well. We will certainly return."}
{"text":"Great idea, love the concept... over 20 different loaded dogs... fair price.. love this place... staff is friendly, service is quick... quality is key when it comes to a good hotdog and they deliver!! If you're a foodie you need to check this place.. it will be on a episode of triple d before you know it!! FLAVOR TOWN USA!"}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG!!! Not a huge hotdog Van never really been my fiancé said he'll try this new hotdog place wasn't very excited obviously. Went inside, this place is  coolest New Age restaurant that I have seen. Dad was running the shop kids were ringing us out. A really cool selection of hotdogs I actually got their mac & cheese dog. My fiancé got their southwestern I believe, quality wise it was phenomenal and they too will also carry really cool old fashion soda pops. They cooled off right there in this machine, they ring you up to bring it out to you and it's like right next to a gas station you would never know that this place was there. Totally need to go there just to try every flavor a hotdog."}
{"text":"If you like great tasting hotdogs and a chill ambiance. This place is for you! We got the Sonoran and Colombian dogs and both were phenomenal. Great verity and all natural meat, and ingredients."}
{"text":"Spend you hard earned money on a local business. Delicious dogs and crispy kettle chips. Can't wait to return and try other dogs. Was too full for dessert but will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome service! Good food. Had the Philly Cheese, wife had the big Texas BBQ. Clean and friendly family ran business."}
{"text":"The food was really good, tried it for the first time tonight and definitely will go back again. Walked in and we helped by young girl who was very charming. It's family run and has a homey charm and the fact the food was great made it even better!"}
{"text":"I've had three different dogs here and they are all delicious. I guess I'll just keep coming back to try them all!"}
{"text":"Normally restaurants next to gas stations aren't associated with quality food; however, this place is not the case. The hot dogs were amazingly tasty! I ordered the Sonoran hot dog and it was loaded with flavor. It was also a price steal. At less than $8 the portions were great. My only complaint would be the coleslaw since it was a little too salty. If you're in the area I recommend you stop by. Plus, excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Delicious & quality ingredients here at doglicious. There was a birthday party for what seemed to be the owner's family going on when we visited for the 1st time and there was absolutely no where to sit. Service was rushed. I was  almost done eating, standing at the counter near the beverage station when the owner told me to \"move the balloons\" and sit where I'd like to. This was a little irritating. But nonetheless the food was very good, fresh and again high quality. They have a big menu of different dogs made fresh to order along with Cole slaw or house made chips. Both were tasty. I will return and hopefully there will be more seating. 4 stars for the food!"}
{"text":"I do advocate a vegan life style but I will say, you do need a cheat day here and there once in a while. As I'm in the area of 51 ave and Bell my ear pricks up. This is one of my cheat day spots. The Chicago dog is my favorite.It comes with coleslaw that is very good. Very fresh ingredients and very cool staff. Don't let the gas station fool you next door. It's very clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get a dawg! Chill atmosphere, quick service and fresh food. I had the Sonoran pup and it was amazing and way better than other local spot. Check this place out ASAP!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Very friendly, family-owned restaurant just kicking out great hot dogs!! So many ways to make a tasty hot dog, who knew?  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise, even with the high Yelp reviews. I had the Kansas City dog, followed by a waffle covered with maple syrup and bacon.  Absolutely delicious. Very friendly owner and staff.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a great find! I love specialty hot dogs and this place doesn't disappoint! Our party of three had the beer chili cheese dog, Hawaiian dog, and New York dog. Everyone raved about how good their meals were. The house made herb kettle chips were delicious. Definitely going to be visiting again!"}
{"text":"First of all, the food tastes good and its a big varied menu of dogs. Some I've never hear of.  Nice family run restaurant, even the little kids were helping today. But im afraid they will get shut down, the kids were not wearing their hair back and one of them was tossing and touching her hair. Then carrying baskets of dogs to tables.  After waiting a while for my carryout dogs, they were busy, i couldnt wait to take a bite in my car. Like i said, tasted good but was lukewarm. I drove 20 miles to try them, don't think it was worth the drive. If i lived closer, i would go back though."}
{"text":"I'm so glad to have found this place. The variety of \"dogs\" available is great. From your classic Chicago dog, to the southwestern style Sonoran dog, to a more exotic Bahn Mi style. I've never been disappointed in ANYTHING I've gotten here.  I tried a slider this time around and a new dog, The Cowboy. Pulled pork slider comes with: pulled pork, onions, slaw, and BBQ sauce. The bun was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. The pulled pork was juicy. The onions (which I hate, but wanted the full experience) and slaw were a PERFECT compliment and gave it a lovely, needed crunch.  The Cowboy comes with a; Vienna dog, bacon, nacho cheese, hickory BBQ sauce, Mayo, pickles jalapeños, and spicy Doritos. This thing definitely has a Spice kick and was amazingly delicious. I got mine with their air fries (air fried French fries) with chili and cheese. These babies were crunchy and so much better than your typical deep-fried friends. Crunchy and not greasy, perfect compliment to my cowboy."}
{"text":"A good variety of different hot dogs to choose from. They  also use Hoffy or Vienna Beef brand dogs. A dog, chips and a drink will definitely fill you up. Every dog has a lot of toppings on it even the most simplest one. Also have sliders and waffle desserts. Friendly family owned business always a good thing to see."}
{"text":"On the positive side they have a very complex menu with a lot of really tasty options for hot dogs and other meats. So I got to New York hot dogs and I also have two french fries instead of kettle chips which come with the hot dogs. First off I thought the hot dogs were little dry and the buns which should put into an oven before serving the customers with burnt on the outside. I also thought that $7 per hot dog plus an additional fee for the french fries which brought my total to $16 was just too high in the pricing. The customer next to me was also complaining about her hot dog being too spicy and I noticed that her bun was also burnt on the outside. Ok place in a Chevron station but I think they need to be aware of their pricing situation and substitution policies. Right now it seems like a place that would better work in Scottsdale for the high price range that they are using right now."}
{"text":"Omg. Just ate here and it was amazing!!! Can not wait to go back and try all of them. The service was awesome. So friendly and fast!  I like that it's a family run restaurant. I will try all of them."}
{"text":"Great dogs, super friendly and nice and clean. Eat here often. Come check it out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a true and authentic review of this hotdog restaurant!!!  Some of the reviews of this place look a little fishy?  The hotdogs they sell here are delicious and the service was great!  The negative now....  $7 bucks for a hotdog and a hand full of chips seems a bit pricey to me and Most people I know would definitely agree.  I wish this new business the best of luck, but with high prices and and a bad track record for that location, I'm not sure they can make it.  No tenants have ever survived in that location.  Time will tell."}
{"text":"Great Vienna dogs however you like them. I had mine with cheddar cheese onions tomato and mustard. I had it steamed and the bun was great. They have a ton of choices here so I will be back. Includes homemade cabbage salad or chips."}
{"text":"I can on national hot dog day and really enjoyed it. I tried the Santa Fe hot dog with sirachia, sauerkraut, jalapeños, and cream cheese. It was so satisfying! I for sure will be back to try more items. Vince, Melanie, and Sofie were very helpful and attentive and my friends even made it super late they were still served only because other people were in their eating. Very positive experience!"}
{"text":"Yummmy.  Not easy to find but once you do you will be back again and again!  High quality sausage and hot dogs. Creative hot dog selections and some of the best Italian beef this reviewer has ate   Really great home made chips and if your lucky Sophia may make it for you."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs and sliders anywhere!! The food is the freshest you will ever get. Everything is so flavorful. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Prices are amazingly wonderful, especially for the value. Our favorites are the Hawaiian hot dog and pulled pork slider. The owners are the sweetest people. They are so helpful, knowledgeable, passionate, and friendly. I can't say enough goods things about this restaurant! It is the cleanest place I have been to in a long time. One visit and you will be hooked!!"}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick late lunch. Met the owner with his 2 kids who were promptly put to work. I love small businesses like this and love supporting them. On to the dogs. American inspired Vienna brand. They have many different pre planned styles. You can choose one of those or design your own. I selected the Chicago dog. It was loaded with onion, mustard, relish, peppers, and tomatoes. It was delish. I have to be honest and say I'm not a big fan of the skin on a Vienna dog buy this one waa crisp and snapped when you bit into it.   Give these guys a try, you really won't be disappointed. I'm going to build my own chili cheese dog on the next visit."}
{"text":"They make a great hot dog. Not to over priced but they have a huge selection. They are doing a great job keeping something going in that spot."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic experience here today. We ordered the Chicago Dog, Mac Attack, Pepperoni Pizza Dog, and a plain hotdog with ketchup. All came with seasoned kettle chips or Cole slaw. We all got the chips. Everything was amazing and I can't wait to go back. Corner of Bell Rd and 51st. Don't miss this family owned restaurant. It is a gem!!!!"}
{"text":"I just devoured the Philly cheese dog....see the picture. It was dam I mean dog good."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Simple and to the point, it's not overdone with frills, but delivers on an amazing and tasty product. Most loaded dogs leave me feeling greasy and gross, but after having a Seattle dog here, I felt satisfied and ready to take on the day. Fresh products and great food, come try this place out. Everyone knows the best places are hole in the wall places and this is one not to be overlooked."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. Place was very clean. Owners were nice, welcoming, and answered our menu questions. They offer locally-made Schreiner's hot dogs dressed any way you'd like and also have a 'signature dogs' menu with really neat offerings. Many topping options and three bun options They also offer Italian beef sandwiches, Belgian waffles, and sliders. It's counter service with self-serve soft drinks (one of those new Pepsi machines with flavor shots).  I had the Mac Attack from their 'signature dogs' menu (Hoffy dog on a coney bun topped with mac n cheese, bacon, and their Doggy sauce). Really tasty dog, snappy and juicy, with toppings piled high. Loved the fresh coney bun, too. My husband enjoyed his 'naked dog' on a coney bun with mustard. The kettle chips on the side were good and sprinkled with some sort of house seasoning. Looking forward to trying their other options like the Who's Reuben Dog, the Loaded Sonoran, and Belgian waffles.  Prices were great for quality and amount of food you get. We got our two meals and two fountain drinks for under $14! Best lunch deal we've had in a long time. Menu listed any signature dog with a side for $5.95 (or 2 dogs for $9.95). The naked dogs (a dog with simple toppings like mustard, ketchup, etc) were even cheaper.  One thing though, the store was hard to spot. We found it because we were specifically looking for it, but might have overlooked if otherwise. In any case, do look for it right on the corner. Worth visiting for sure. We'll be back."}
{"text":"30 minutes after eating here, I had to rush home because I got violently sick. Maybe skip on the chili."}
{"text":"Had no idea this place existed. Don't let the high school kids serving fool you as well as the place being in the same building as a gas station. This place rocks.  Why go there: The menu is rather large and has plenty of different choices.  The service is not the fastest but the dogs are worth it. The buns are great, all of the choices are fairly well designed and make sense.  The pricing is so good you should try at least a couple.  Tip:  Be patient, the final product is great, don't be put off by the location. Try it!"}
{"text":"My friends at this hot dog restaurant are the best, they really do care about my business and my families wants. They treat us like kings every time we go in there for hot dogs and let me say that they have the best waffles in town, we love this place.Thank you guys for your good food and your treats,\"D MOTA'S\"."}
{"text":"Came across this place online cause I was craving a hot dog. I am very pleased with my choice to come here it's amazing , the owner's are super friendly and attenative  And the food is on its A game not to mention very affordable. I can see this place really making and impression cause it sure did with me !!!! I loved every bite the sonoran dog and Chicago dog are my favorite !!!! And the fact that I can have cherry flavored Dr pepper made my day I for sure cheated on my diet by having way more then I should have!!!! Will defiantly be back for more my new spot   Good luck on your bussiness y'all are great"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice and the staff super friendly. My food wasn't bad... But major loss of points for nothing being even remotely hot. Hot dogs should be hot!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a while and I highly recommend it to everybody. This place absolutely hit the spot. Hands down best dog I've had in the Valley. Everything was so fresh and the bun was delicious. Fast and friendly service. I'll definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"OMG, they certainly gave this place the right name. The reviews don't lie! Great food, friendly staff, clean. I highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"I have been so excited to try this place since it has such high reviews on yelp. It did not disappoint. Amazing food, atmosphere, and customer service.   When you first walk in it's a cute, small, and clean restaurant. There is the sweetest family that owns it. Looked like a husband, wife and two young daughters. Everyone was so nice and caring asking how everything was and gave recommendations when ordering. The little girls actually made our delicious hot dogs. You could tell they enjoyed it and knew it well.   My fiancé and I git 3 hotdogs to split because we couldn't decide on only 2. We got the cowboy, Sonoran dog, and mac attack. They were all delicious. Tons of toppings so it was messy to eat so get lots of napkins! They come with the choice of chips or coleslaw. We got the kettle chips and they were good. Prices were good too. We got 3 signature dogs with kettle chips and a drink for $20.  Excited to come back to try more items. Highly recommend to others. Thanks (:"}
{"text":"Plenty of parking, gas station nearby, restaurant right at major intersection. Easy access, just a few minutes south of I-17 at Bell Road and 51st.  At least 24 different hot dog specials on the menu, fountain drinks and ice tea. High quality dogs come with kettle chips or salad/slaw. Buns are made there and made fresh daily.   Order at the counter from dad or daughters. All three are involved in all that goes on and they're very prompt, courteous and efficient in taking your order and getting it ready. Eat in or carry out...wasn't counting but it looked like seating for around 20.  The dogs are hot, freshly cooked and outrageously garnished with practically anything you can imagine putting on a hot dog. I didn't ask but I feel certain that custom variations are easy to do.  My wife and I each enjoyed our dogs and chips and slaw with two large ice teas. We left full, smiling and content. Next time we're in  Phoenix, we will likely stop. It's good, it's easy, it's fast and all things considered, fairly priced."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to meet up for lunch I had not been to. It had to be near the paths we were running to get stuff done. My friend had been here before and it sounded like a place we could eat quickly and get back on our separate ways. We got here just as they opened the doors at 11. The place was clean. The friendly owner took our orders and shortly our dogs came out. A really good dog on a fresh baked bun smothered in Mac and cheese and dog sauce garnish. With a choice of cole slaw or chips I thought the $5.95 price was real reasonable. It's good to have a different option in my hood."}
{"text":"They have a very interesting take on hot dogs. And they're all pretty good and smells good in there. I did get the pepperoni dog with fries and a drink. And it was very good and tasty. It is located next to the gas station."}
{"text":"Once again another great experience. The hotdogs are amazing and the service is even better. Today had the Sonoran Dog and it was a great blend of flavors (don't go in expecting street vendor style). Really one of those places that earns every hit of its 5 star rating. (Also great to see an owner teaching his kids how to work and helping out his community)."}
{"text":"Delicious hot dogs and amazing service!! Definitely coming back next time I'm in Arizona and in the area."}
{"text":"We were in an unfamiliar part of town for our son's science competition, and found Doglicious Hot Dogs on Yelp. Don't be put off by the fact it's attached to a gas station: it's a great place.  We were greeted by the friendly and conscientious owner. It's obvious that she wants you to feel welcome, and will answer any questions you have about the menu. Their all-beef hot dogs and Schreiner sausages are prepared in a variety of unique, gourmet ways. I like more basic stuff, but enjoyed my chili cheese dog. The hot dog had a nice snap to it, and I liked the added touch of sprinkling Frito shards on the chili. They serve air fries: fries cooked by hot air and sprinkled with seasoned salt. Everything was great. They also serve sandwiches and salads if you don't want a hot dog.  It's nice to see a small business put a lot of thought and care into what they're doing. We would definitely return if we find ourselves in this part of town again."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!!!! It was our first time here and I was very impressed. So many different options yet still the classic choices. We can't wait to go back.l"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall, difficult to find as it is located alongside the Chevron. Nonetheless, we made it after multiple attempts. First & foremost, customer service was okay, could use a bit more animation & engagement. Cute, inviting decor. Wait time was quick, seemed business was a bit slow for a Sunday afternoon. A bit over priced, although we are all for supporting small businesses. Diverse hot dog selection. Lots of options, however if you are like me it makes it a little difficult to choose. Then you find yourself trying to convince your husband to pick one of your top choices to get a taste because you are suppose to be on a diet. Both hot dogs picked: Sonoran and big TX bbq were delicious. However, if I had to pick one over the other it would be the Sonoran. Each hot dog comes with your choice of kettle chips or coleslaw. The kettle chips were a bit stale, and the coleslaw was just the slaw dry, no dressing. Not sure if this is typical, but as a side it costs $2.50. Not worth it to me, but honestly I think they just forgot. Overall, would we visit again? Not sure, but most definitely glad we stopped by."}
{"text":"We had the Sonoran dog and the Italian beef. Both were very good. Love the father and daughter. The girl is great! Been back one more time and so far so good will be continuing to go back because I love hotdogs"}
{"text":"A funky but oddly delicious \"coleslaw\" along with the Loaded Sonoran. Looks yummO... Oh dear Lord in heaven, absolutely out-of-this-world amazing! Definitely gives, Boston, Chicago, and New York a run for their money. The hubs had the Pepperoni dog and the Cheesy Beef Slider and was blown away with the layering of flavors. Yes, it's tucked away at the end of the Chevron building but most definitely worth the hunt. GPS is your friend and friends encourage friends to eat great food. Stop in, pass it on, bring others. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered the Columbiano. Out of this world  PHENOMENAL!!! Best dog I have ever had....period. Balanced - snap from the casing, melty-gooey cheese, tart sauce, topped with potato chips and pineapple relish. THE BUN --- toasted outside crunch, soft lux interior - perfection.   Fast, friendly service by owner and his family.  This place is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent!! Tried the Sonoran, Kansas City, and chill in slaw dogs.. All were fabulous."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of hot dogs and this place does not disappoint. From the Vietnamese (Bahn Mi) with its fresh veggies and peanut sauce to the Rueben Dog. Both were excellent as well as the Dr Pepper pulled pork slider. Customer service was fantastic and the place is spotless."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday for lunch with my wife, around Noon, No wait to order. They have an amazing variety of dogs. I had the Seattle Dog- bratwurst with sauerkraut, cream cheese, jalapenos and Sirachi sauce. Very good. My wife had a Reuben dog with kraut and pastrami-also very good. Both were huge and served with kettle chips, $6.50 each. Add a soda and came to $9 each. Took about ten minutes from ordering to getting the food. The owner or maybe manager came by and asked how everything was.  They must have at least 12 different types of dogs, and salads and even waffles!  You don't go for the atmosphere-concrete floors and they need to fire their window cleaner. But the food was good. We'll go again."}
{"text":"Excellent hot dogs and Cole slaw. Very nice place and the menu has a lot more then just hot dogs. From salads to Beefs! Very family friendly and friendly owner as well. Definitely give it a try! Being from Chicago it's nice to find a real Chicago Dog!!"}
{"text":"I had the Chicago dog with chips and the waffle. It was so good. The owners are really friendly too. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"If this spot weren't so far from me I would be a constant regular! There are so many options to choose from and I feel like you cannot go wrong with any of them. They are a great size and so delicious. The service is really nice and friendly you can tell they genuinely care about their service. I would skip on the french fries though they weren't very special but if you are around the location you have to go the hot dogs are great!"}
{"text":"This place was great I would've gave it five stars if it didn't permit pets inside it kind of throws off your appetite. I was almost tempted to turn around and leave when I saw a lady with a dog inside and it wasn't a medical dog but I'm glad I didn't.  I got my hotdog to go and it was amazing it really taste like a New York  dirty dog."}
{"text":"The food is very good but the prices leave something to be desired. I wanted just 2 regular hot dogs with mustard and onions and celery salt. They have what is called a naked dog that is listed at $3.75 but I was then told that the price had actually been increased to $5.50 even though it is still marked at $3.75. So for 2 what I would consider non jumbo dogs that are just mustard and onion I paid over $12.00. It is not worth that for just 2 regular dogs. First semi negative experience here."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday for a quick bite, ordered the Chicago dog with Slaw. Really great bun and the hot dog was great! Very impressed with the quality. There were two girls inside and the Dad was outside working on the food truck, they were very nice and asked if everything was to my liking, will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My dad-in-law and I ate here for lunch a couple of weeks ago.  I absolutely love a good hot dog and Doglicious Hot Dogs absolutely know what they're doing.  I ordered (2) Chicago Classic Dogs with all the fixings and they did not disappoint!  Service was excellent and prompt.  The restaurant was clean, overall.  I know it's just a hot dog, but I would not hesitate to recommend them to a friend or family member.  Absolutely excellent for lunch.  Simple.  Easy.  And tasty!  :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Fresh and made to order! We had the Italian beef sandwich and the beef sliders. Our food was made exactly as we ordered and delicious! Staff was friendly and I would recommend this place to all my friends!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Driving by found this little place attached to a gas station and decided to stop in and have lunch with my son.  You our surprise we got two of the best hotdogs ever.  We tried the spicy Italian sausage, and the Chicago tamale as well as the air fries.  Wow what a find.  The Guinness chili was great!  If I have to be critical I would say my least favorite would be the coleslaw, very salty.  However it won't stop me from coming back.  See you again soon!"}
{"text":"So yummy! I had the Classic Chicago dog and loved it. I will definitely be back. Such a sweet family that owns & operates. Great price, $5.95 for a delicious dog and homemade chips!"}
{"text":"Stopped at got my vape juice next door and saw this place. Finally went in today and so glad I did!  What I found was a small gem that was totally unexpected.   Truthfully I'm not sure what I expected. I thought perhaps I'd find a cheap hotdog with ketchup and mustard. Boy was I wrong.   They have a ton of options of pre-made dogs and the ability to create your own.  I got the Big Texas BBQ dog that was so loaded with pulled pork I had to eat it with a fork. It was wonderful.   It has the vibe of a chain-style restaurant, with the decor and setup, but the family feel of a hole in the wall joint.  The owner (didn't catch his name) was pleasant and his daughters (grand daughters?) were charming and sweet.     Definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"After recommending a million times.  Really disappointed today. Cold dog and stale bun.    And service not what it was.   It's a shame because the family and concept is great"}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and was looking for a good hot dog place know that these are not QT hot dogs these are real hot dogs so when you pay their prices and it's not a dollar fifty that's why the service was fun and friendly the guys had a good sense of humor they're only drawback is the Seattle hot dog should actually be called the Spokane dog  I will be frequently returning to this place thank you guys for your wonderful service"}
{"text":"Now this is a great find! Hot dogs of all kinds, bratwurst, fries that are amazing...simply delicious! They use Vienna hot dogs. Had a naked dog (mustard and relish) and my husband had the chili cheese (German beer chili, nacho cheese and Fritos on it). Ordered their air fries....yummy! All of it was good. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I thought I had posted this review forever ago, but I guess it saved in my drafts. This place was great. So many options. Real family feel."}
{"text":"This is Glendale's hidden jem! The lady that helps makes the hotdogs was so nice and the hotdogs are delish! I got the Sonoran dog and my husband got the Mac attack dog. Definitely a place to stop by with the fam !"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after reading all the great reviews but unfortunately I was kinda disappointed. I ordered the loaded Sonoran dog and it was OK but not great. The hot dog was cold and the bread they use for a bun was soggy and fell apart. The cole slaw that came with it lacked flavor and didnt seem very fresh. Also my son ordered the mac and squid and that was even more disappointing. The mac is literally kraft Mac and cheese (that they microwave) and the hot dog that is cut to look like a squid (cute idea) was hard and dried out. Overall it was just ok not what I expected kind of a bummer."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome family owned restaurant. My new yorker and Chicago dogs were delicious. All dogs come with homemade potato chips or coleslaw. Both were yummy. The Belgian waffle with strawberry sauce was incredible."}
{"text":"Doglicious is a great example of why I'm constantly forcing my girlfriend to try new places. Although most end up being bad, every once in a blue moon, you find something that's actually worth a damn. And Doglicious is one of those rare places where my expectations were surprisingly exceeded thanks to the quality of the food.  Honestly, I've never been that big into hot dogs. While I like them, I feel they quickly digest into mixed concrete and just settle into your stomach pit for all of eternity. But when they're good, I guess I'm willing to make the sacrifice.   Doglicious is located next to a gas station. Once upon a time, this building was a Quiznos - back when they still held some fast food relevance. The place is not only family owned, but family operated - meaning that even the kids will take your order and prepare the food.   I ordered a Mac Attack, which includes mac and cheese, bacon, and ketchup - which I requested to be withheld from mine. My girlfriend ordered the La Columbiana, which featured a boatload of toppings, including pineapple sauce, pink sauce (mayo and ketchup), mustard, bacon, and cheese. Both orders come with kettle chips, although we later noticed on the menu that slaw was an option (but we were not asked).  Okay, so my belief has always been that you can dump as much crap as you want onto your hot dogs. But if the quality of the dog itself sucks, then your dog sucks - regardless of how much you try to compensate. Thankfully, what they serve here is actually great quality. I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of both of our orders, which will inspire me to eventually return to experiment with their other options.  So, it wasn't perfect, unfortunately. They did put ketchup on my dog by mistake. However, I didn't want to wait for them to make another, so I just toughed up and tolerated it. Additionally, we ordered one of their miniature waffles with Nutella, which was also very good for the four-dollar price tag.  Overall, this is one of those small businesses that I want to see succeed. With quality food and a bit of cleverness, the positive Yelp reviews are completely justified.  Highly recommended for a dog fix!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Hawaiian dog and it was very good! The coleslaw is really good too and normally I don't like coleslaw. Can't wait to try the Sonoran dog next"}
{"text":"Went in yesterday and had the Sonoran Hot dog and it was delicious. Great snap to the dog and the toppings were amazing. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Hot dog connoisseur kid gives it 4 stars. Cute hot dog shop/lunch stop. Always happy to find a quality,non-chain, food stop on the Westside. Son enjoyed plain Vienna hot dog. I enjoyed a Chicago Beef. The included kettle chips were great. \"Air fried\" fries were saved by the light season salt seasoning. $20 for the above plus 1 soda. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Amazing hotdogs, down to earth good people. I'll be a customer for life! Tons of options and each one I've tried has been nothing short of delicious. Try the chili cheese!"}
{"text":"Great great place to grab a hot dog or a bratwurst.....the bratwurst is sourced locally from Schreiners sausage, another Phx staple. We will be back again and again"}
{"text":"The Coney Dogs felt almost like home (Detroit)! I have also had the Sonoran, which was yummy, but not as good as the Coney Dog. The buns are delicious and the dogs have the snap I love and miss from my hometown. The owner is friendly and the restaurant is clean. The only issue I've had is that the two times I've been there, they forgot that I wanted 1/2 and 1/2 kettle chips and cole slaw, and the soda machine was a little flat. Nothing horrible, and a whole serving of the kettle chips were fine because they are relish! We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious Chicago Dog and kettle chips.  Modern decor - cute and clean.  Family atmosphere is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Delicious combinations of hot dogs. Homemade cole slaw and kettle chips. Family owned and operated, no really...a nice couple and their kids working the counter making the sandwiches. We will be back!"}
{"text":"So amazing! I was craving a hot dog and found this one on Yelp. Me and my friend shared a Chicago dog and a Dirty Island dog. Everything was delicious! All the details are on point. Even the chips and coleslaw they make for sides are amazing. If you're not into toppings for some reason, this place is still amazing cause the hotdog and buns are really good themselves! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious hot dogs that are unique from anything else you can get nearby. I highly recommend checking them out and training any of their dogs!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The hotdog menu is creative. The hotdog brands offered are top of the line. The coleslaw is the best I've had anywhere. Everything is spotless and the Latin vibe is great. Plus they have waffles!"}
{"text":"It's a small, family run restaurant that offers good food at reasonable prices. The service is fast and friendly. The location they are in has had a number of tenants come and go over the years so I really hope this place stays in business for a long time."}
{"text":"The location of this place totally threw me off. I wasn't sure if it was in the chevron or not. It's not but literally right next to it. We almost did go in because we thought it was part of the chevron. Glad we circled back.  Overall we really enjoyed the hot dogs. So many different toppings and creations. I got the Mac Attack, the boyfriend got the Big Texas and the kids got plan hot dogs with ketchup. No complaints other than I wish they didn't boil their dogs. I personally liked grilled but that's just me."}
{"text":"We have lived here in this area for two years and I'm so glad we found this place early on! We love to bring any friends or guests we have to this place.   They have so many hot dog options that it's so hard to pick just one. My husband and I usually choose two different ones and split them.   We've had the Mac Attack, Aloha, Chicago, The Texan, Sonoran, and my son loves their Mac and Squid (which is a hot dog that looks like a squid, Mac and cheese and chips). My son always finishes his meal and loves their Mac and Cheese.   Each hot dog comes with such a unique combination of flavors. Like the Aloha has such a delicious jalapeño relish! The the Mac and Cheese on the Mac Attack is so cheesy and creamy. And the Texan has really good pulled pork! And the Chicago is spot on authentic Chicago dog.  (and I've had Portillos Chicago dogs in Chicago!)   The basics of each hot dog are a great foundation to any hot dog. Each hot dog I've tried is hot and a great snap to the dog. The bread is always so soft and perfect item to hold such great hot dog items.   Each hot dog comes with kettle cooked chips or coleslaw. I'm very picky about my coleslaw and I dont love the one they serve here but I love me some chips with hot dog.   I don't think you'll ever be disappointed with any hot dog option!!"}
{"text":"Came up on this joint from reading recent reviews in the area.  It too far from my house and I'm a big supporter of local business plus my wife was craving hot dogs. Well not just ordinary hot dogs, gourmet dogs. After looking at all the user photos I was sold on the \"Mac Attack\" and she was sold on the \"aloha dog\".   The Mac Attack was a dog with mac n cheese,  nacho cheese and bacon on it. I ordered it without the \"doggy sauce\". Wow was it heaven in a bun!!!!  Should be called \"heart attack\" but I worked out extra hard the rest of the week so I should be ok.lol.  Wife loved her Aloha dog. Basically a dog with pinnacle relish and other fruits and veggies. I think it had banana peppers. She wouldn't share hers with me so we will have to go back to try my own.   Yes it's next to a gas station but it's not connected. It's really nice inside and the workers in there are. Ice. Feels family owned for sure.   The only reason for a 4 star and not a 5 star was they stopped doing their 2 dogs with chips for $10. Only saved me like $2.50 but I was hopping for it. It was in many of the users photos. I would like to see that special come back and I would be coming back even more! But don't worry I will be back..just he special would get me going even more!  They also serve up Belgium waffles which I didn't try but will soon. From other Yelpers they look amazing so I can't wait."}
{"text":"Cute place, do not be fooled by the location right next to  gas station, this place is a stand alone shop, small but mighty.  The owners are always there and extremely friendly and helpful.  The hot dogs are so Doglicious, the name is right on! I do not usually like hot dogs but these are so worth it I went back a couple of times already, way over my once every year or so hot dog quota!"}
{"text":"Family owned quality hot dogs. Delicious.  I enjoyed the rainbow salad ( sliced tomato, shredded lettuce, carrot, onion, red cabbage with a basalmic vinegerette and a beef slider.  My spouse enjoyed the Sabrett hot dog on poppy seed bun with homemade potato chips."}
{"text":"I mean besides the fact that I couldn't put more dogs in the ol belly this place is fantastic. 100% family ran lol. I mean dad at the beginning kids with the toppings and mom's taking and giving orders lol. Bomb food. More than just hot dogs trust me"}
{"text":"The Young Gentleman and I both agree this place deserves five out of five stars. I had the \"Bahn Mi\", which is a Vienna dog on a Coney bun with cucumber, carrots, cilantro, purple cabbage, pickled jalapeños, peanut sauce and whole peanuts. It was an absolutely delicious Vietnamese style delight. The youngster had a BLT dog that was probably delicious but he refused to let me have a bite and I'm not salty about that at all. The homemade chips that come with all the dogs were delicious as well, and the air fries were crispy and perfect. The menu is filled with very interesting selections like Philly cheese steak dog, the Ruben, the big Texas, the aloha and something I've got to try call the La Columbiana. Also they serve an ice cream split with bacon where you usually put the banana, so yeah, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"What a great little gem, this family run gourmet hot doggery delivers on flavor as well as overall service.  There are unique combinations all with top notch ingredients. I get the BLT dog when I visit Dogilicious Hot Dogs. It is exactly what you think crispy bacon crisp lettuce and fresh tomatoes on a Vienna dog.  The dog is balanced in flavor and texture and is prepared by a gracious family that takes pride in what they do. I am happy to support a local business that takes so much care to insure that every visit is perfect."}
{"text":"This place was great. First time at a fancy dog place and I will be back. Sliders were good to and the chips had a nice flavor."}
{"text":"This place is great and the owner is awesome!!! The food is spectacular...great bun, dog, toppings, and flavor. So glad I found it. Support your local small business and give it a try. Don't be fooled by being next to the gas station...the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Really good food! Stopped in quickly on my lunch and there is plenty of toppings to choose from and the pricing was fair. The lady who helped me was very friendly as well. Will definitely be back next time im looking for a delicious hot dog!"}
{"text":"Just ate there today. Had a coney dog which is a chili dog w/o cheese with mustard and onion. The dog was very tasty but didn't have enough chili on it. The owner said they used to put more chili on it but customers complained they couldn't pick it up and eat it. Who picks up a chili dog you eat it with a fork and knife. even though it was light on chili the chili was deeelicious. Homemade. The chips are good. Only have really one complaint- being a Georgia girl disappointed they serve pepsi products.  If your looking for an unusual and tasty dog this is the place. I have never seen so many different types of hot dogs. I got a Hawaiian to go and can't wait to taste it.The owner was very friendly and this was one of the best hot dog experiences I've had. It is next to a Chevron gas station on the NE corner of Bell Ave & 51st"}
{"text":"Wonderful little gem! Great service and fresh food. I definitely recommend if your in the area."}
{"text":"I got a nacho and a sonoran dog and it was ok. I also got there chili slaw slider which was good. I thought the buns were a little stale. The cashier was very friendly and the restaurant was nice and clean."}
{"text":"Just tried this gem for the first time based on the Yelp reviews. It exceeded my expectations! The owner is really friendly and the food is delicious!! Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"My girl brought me there today, she knows I love hot dogs!! Was a good beefy tasty dog!!! And he said they had Belgian waffles that were pretty amazing for breakfast. I will definitely go back and try a few more. the menu looks pretty good."}
{"text":"Don't let the located deter you the food is excellent. Had the Chicago dog and Coney dog. I like how they pair it with great slaw with a dressing in it or chips. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a surprise! Hot dog paradise! Tons of fixins and endless options! Service was great and the two little ladies working the register and making the food was unexpected...so cute! Definitely a place to check out for a quick inexpensive lunch!!! Awesome!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the cowboy and the colombiana. Both were amazing. Both dogs were topped and sauced to perfection. They were definitely knife and fork dogs so you can get a taste of all the toppings in one bite. Lifting them for each bite is almost impossible. Only addition would be jalapeños on the colombiana. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs around! My family got the naked, Texas, and Chicago dogs. Each one was delicious but the BBQ sauce on the Texas was amazing. We will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"I saw this place and I looked at the reviews, there's no way this could be \"five stars\" and so I tried it out and WOW is it five stars and some!  Hot Diggity - hot Diggity dog!"}
{"text":"I ordered a dog with the basics. Mustard, relish and onion. I do this when I try a new place because I want to taste the main ingredient that they are specializing in. I am from the east coast and base my hot dog rating on dirty water dogs. The result, delicious! I will definitely return to try a different style of dog. They also offer salads and sandwiches, along with waffles for desert."}
{"text":"Don't be mislead about the location and don't be \"above paying $2 for a hotdog\".   The price is fair, the portions healthy and the family running the business are very conscientious of their customers.  I work nearby and am a frequent consumer! I enjoy every aspect of this family run, quality dog shop!"}
{"text":"First of all, I love me some hot dogs. When I come to Doglicious I know I'm going to get a quality dog every time. They have a wide array of dogs on the menu and they're always tasty. Not to mention they use natural casings so you get a nice snap when you bite into them. It's family owned so that's a plus, too. The owner is really nice and usually comes around to see to how you're doing."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town... and have to say this is one of the most unique mom-and-pop shop I've ever seen!! The hotdogs here are NO joke! They're amazing! I was convinced to get the Seattle... and I don't regret it at all!! Who knew cream cheese, a bratwurst, and (get this) onions cooked in soda would be such a great mix?!? Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a very delicious hot dog! Family runs the whole show! The owner is a amazing guy to talk to! Great service!"}
{"text":"Nice Family operation. A real Mom & Pop like the old days. I was greeted by the owner and he explained his favorite and best sellers. I opted for the Sonora Dog which had everything from beans, bacon, cheese and salsa skillfully  made by his young daughter. The Hoffy Dog was plump and juicy, it was a unique twist on the basic Sonora Dog, well worth the extra money. I will be back and hope others find this hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! They have amazing hot dogs and bratwurst. Then add amazing combinations of toppings. Gotta try them all."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!! Best hot dogs ever! I got the Chili Cheese Dog and it was so fresh and delicious. Come try their food, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Pulled up and I was not sure about a hot dog place at a gas station. But it was worth taking the risk. Nice family owned place with every made from scratch."}
{"text":"I work in the salon behind the restaurant in the same lot. Friendly staff, clean restaurant, nice atmosphere, and quick service. And not to mention their delicious loaded hot dogs! Definitely a great option for when I need a quick bite between clients!"}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in town! This is a pleasant family-run hot dog joint with a wide variety of selections, over 24 different signature hot dogs on their menu.  They have a slick deal of two signature dogs for $9.95 that includes a side of kettle chips or homemade coleslaw.   The New Yorker Dog was doglicious! You can choose either warm or cold sauerkraut. I was pretty satisfied with the decision of cold sauerkraut. We also had the Loaded Sonoran Dog that was jam-packed with fresh toppings.  I just didn't like the pinto bean on the dog since it took away the flavor of the dog, and additionally made the bread a little soggy. Overall, there was that good snap in the hot dogs; not to mention great flavors and they come in a good size - perfection. The kettle chips were on point. I can't speak for the coleslaw since we didn't try them this time around.   The location is right next to Chevron gas station, making it convenient for a quick grab-and-go meal. The dogs are filling and delicious, simply a better alternative than stopping at the gas station for food when these hot dogs are only a few steps away. Moreover, the interior is clean with high tables/stools along with booth seating.   Food was doglicious. Prices were fair. Service was excellent. I will definitely be returning to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"This review is a bit over due. Best hot dogs I ever had bar none. Pretty good selection of craft brew as well. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place has amazing hot dogs!

Check it out!i  2nd time back and our second great experience! Great quality hotdog,  warm hotdog rolls and warm chips it's the best!"}
{"text":"A Gourmet American Classic at Doglicious Hot Dogs  Video review: https://youtu.be/unKUyjqhRVI  American cuisine is often under-rated internationally. When I speak to people from other countries about \"American Food\", they all seem to think that the only things we have are Hot Dogs and Hamburgers. And to that I say, \"HECK YEAH\". While it isn't true that we only have hot dogs and hamburgers in American cuisine, it is true that these are two very important dishes. And when done right, these simple American classics can be mind blowing. And that is exactly what we found at Doglicious Hot Dogs in Phoenix, Arizona.  Right from the start I knew I was going to like Doglicious Hot Dogs. The first thing you see when you walk in is a wall-menu with all of the different specialty hot dogs available. With fun names like \"La Colombiana\", \"Dirty Island\", and the \"Who's Reuben\" you're going to need a few minutes to look over the 24 different types of dogs available. But don't worry, if you don't find one that want (which would be impossible anyway) then you can create your own customized hot dog using any combination of the ingredients available.  They also have a large variety of cool specialty sodas like \"Afri Cola\" and \"Dang's Butterscotch Root Beer\". Doglicious Hot Dogs uses fresh baked buns sourced daily from a local baker. In addition, they source 100% all beef natural casing hot dogs. They offer Vienna and Sabrett hot dogs as well as local Schreiners sausages. If you want next level hot dogs then Doglicious is the place to go. Any serious foodie must make the hot dog pilgrimage to Doglicious. It's a local spot, easy to find, and dogs are amazing.  The first hot dog we tried was the \"Philly Cheese Steak\" with loaded chili cheese fries. The Philly ingredients are a natural fit for a hot dog. A Vienna dog placed deep in Coney bun and then topped with giardiniera pickled peppers and vegetables, and a thin sliced Italian beef and provolone cheese. Every bite of the Philly was amazing. The Italian beef and provolone cheese really made this hot dog feel like a true Philly Cheese Steak, only better. The loaded chili cheese fries were great too. I am a bit picky when it comes to finding a good chili, but there were no issues here. Doglicious is definitely using top end ingredients.   The second hot dog we tried was the \"Cowboy\" and it was my favorite dog of the day. This hot dog was loaded with hickory smoked bacon, nacho cheese, Kansas style barbecue sauce, mayo, jalapenos, crushed Doritos on top. Something about this hot dog made me feel like I was eating something much fancier than just a regular old hot dog. This was indeed an elevated version of the classic American hot dog. It was both delicious and fun at the same time. Every bite of the Cowboy hot dog put a smile on my face.  The third hot dog we tried was the \"Sonoran\" and it was a perfect representation of the Sonoran Desert on a bun. The Sonoran Desert is famously known as the hottest desert in Mexico and the Sonoran hot dog at Doglicious was a hot and delicious treat. Pinto beans, bacon, salsa roja, nacho cheese, onions, tomato, cilantro, mexicream, pickled jalapenos, cotija cheese, and tajin seasoning made the Sonoran hot dog an explosion of flavors in my mouth. To top it off, the coleslaw and handcrafted dressing added a nice cool break between bites of the perfectly spicy Sonoran hot dog. But be warned, this is a knife-and-fork type of dog, unless you don't mind a face full of sloppy deliciousness.   The owner, Vincent, gave us a Belgium Liege Waffle for dessert. It was lightly crispy on the outside and fluffy and soft on the inside. Topped with whipped cream, crunchy marshmallows, and chocolate, this was as much a piece of art as it was a delicate and delicious dessert. Everything we tried at Doglicious Hot Dogs was over the top GREAT! When people like Vince and his family put so much passion and care into their food and business, it is easy to see how they are quickly making a name for themselves as the best hot dogs in Phoenix, Arizona.   Doglicious currently has one location, but I hope they will have more in the future. They have something special at Doglicious and I hope everyone reading this post stops by and tries their dogs. Give Vince a big \"Hello\" and let him know you found him though Finding Food TV when you stop in. Doglicious is open seven days a week, Monday thru Friday from 11:00 AM until 8:00 PM. They are located at 5060 W Bell Rd Suite A, Glendale, AZ 85308, on the North-East corner of Bell Rd. and 51st Ave. You can also connect with them online at their website or on their Facebook page and on Instagram.  http://www.doglicioushotdogs.com/ https://www.facebook.com/doglicioushotdogs/ https://www.instagram.com/Doglicioushotdogs/  Go, eat, smile, and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I love the toppings. Boiled instead of grilled is not my top choice of making dogs but I'll make an exception. Muy favorite is the bahn mi. Wish my mouth could open as wide as the dog for each bite."}
{"text":"Two days in a row when you're only in the area for two days when there are so many lunch options?  Yep.  We went there for lunch on a whim and were instantly hooked.   So much so that we went back the next day.  The place is clean, efficient and reasonably priced.  There are a ton of options.  I would recommend the Chili Cheese or the Chicago.  There are a lot of others to choose from.  Add some fries, kettle chips or slaw to round out your meal.  Go there once and you'll go there often."}
{"text":"Speed of service, below average. 10 minute wait at 5:10 PM. Customer service Above average! 2 dogs and chips or slaw for $9.95. Large wieners, fresh buns and neon green relish! Chicago dog was very tasty. New York dog, not as much. Difficult to give it legitimacy when they use a Vienna dog. Got to have Sabrett's or at least a Nathan's!! Cole slaw is solid. Nice change of pace to a Wendy's run!"}
{"text":"My favorite hotdog place.  Had a \"Naked Dog\" with a Sabrett dog on a poppy seed bun.  Good selection of toppings, kettle cooked chips were crisp and not to salty.  A little hidden behind the pumps at a large Chevron gas station, NE corner of Bell  and 51St."}
{"text":"I was confused at first, because the spot looks like it is a part of the gas station,  but in actuality it is right next door. You walk in and the place is open and clean. The vibe is surprisingly and pleasantly hispanic! The smell is great, and don't even get me started on the customer service! I was greeted by the owners daughter, she was sweet and her game was on point! She was probably about it 12, but she could train a crew on how to interact with customers. The food here is authentic, made with love, and the ingredients are all top notch! Make sure you stop in and get a Sonoran dog or a Chicago dog. I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent dogs and great service! We had a really great time. This is a great neighborhood family oriented place. We definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was delicious!! Used local schreiners and fresh home made bread! The ingredients were a perfect mix! I got the Seattle dog and was definitely the prettiest hot dog ever! The coleslaw was the best I've had very peppery! I loved it! Very few local spots in Glendale please visit!"}
{"text":"How good is this to stumble on a hotdog gourmet !!?!?!!  lots to choose from -  COME IN !!!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy a hot dog, this place is a must. We enjoyed the Mac Attack and the Loaded Sonoran dog served with choice of Cole slaw or Rosemary potato chips. There are many different options to choose from for your loaded hot dog. I doubt you can really go wrong. They even have a kids menu with a hot dog cut and shaped like a squid. (No bun needed). Very friendly service and appears to be  family owned and working there together and aim to please. We decided to try this place we found on Yelp with 5 Star reviews and glad we did."}
{"text":"Best polish I have had in Arizona since we moved here !!! By far better then Portillos polish ,and so many custom dogs to choose from or you can build your own,what I really like is the fries are air fried and not drowning in grease from an oil fryer  very friendly owners,and nice and clean atmosphere.."}
{"text":"Outstanding Coney dog!! Loved seeing the owner and family on site. Very friendly people! Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great find, Sonoran hot dog was on point I could taste each one of the ingredients. I now have a great go to place for a great dog that's on the West side. Menu has many different dog concoctions to choose from. Owners are friendly and helpful service is prompt and courteous. Establishment was clean and bright. Great job I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Really great hot dogs! The establishment is really clean with a lot of seating available. Literally too many options to name off in terms of gourmet dogs. The loaded Sonoran was delicious and the bread was fantastic. Also spring for cole slaw, it was really light and delicious!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. All their hotdogs are pretty tasty and the customer service is phenomenal! I usually get the aloha dog, which has been my favorite so far."}
{"text":"WOW 5+++ Stars!!! The Italian Beef was excellent, filling and tasted great. The Sonaran Hot Dog was also beyond words (you can't find many good ones around here). I would also recommend the Italian Tamale, Cheese Fries, Kettle Chips and even the Cole Slaw... Great family run business, excellent food that is very filling. We will be back soon to try many other choices very soon. Hope you can try them out and support another great Family buisness!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Every time I go there I try something different and it never disappoints! Their coleslaw is just absolutely delicious! And you can't beat the prices! They are very personable and great with their customers, my new favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and \"WHAT A FIND\". I'm a big aficionado of REAL dogs and Delicious Dogs has it all. I've eaten half way through the menu and haven't had a bad one yet. This family run business (I asked) is a staple of my diet. Make the trip you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really good hot dogs.   They have such a wide variety and such creative hot dog creations.   I tried the Mac and cheese dog and the bratwurst and both were great.   When I go back I will be certain to try their Italian beef and Dr. Pepper pulled pork sliders.   The prices are really reasonable for the amount of food that you get."}
{"text":"Okay. I read the reviews.  It's a mile or so from my house. I ordered the Polish dog. Off the hook!!! Sorry Guy Fieri... Seriously, the cole slaw is different but very delicious.  My husband got the chili dog. He loved it! The kettle chips are wonderful! The owner and his daughter were working.  Very friendly and aimed to please.  Very clean place. They have so many awesome choices and you can create your own. I wonder how long it will take to go through the whole menu..."}
{"text":"Amazing hot dogs! Worth a drive to the northwest side. Creative recipes, quality ingredients, healthy portions, and great service!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and wanted something quick. The trusty Yelp machine suggested this place - hot dogs and 4.5 stars... just 10 minutes away? We're there.  It may not look like much from the outside; it is part of a gas station. You know, like those places with the gas station McDonald's, Blimpie, A&W, etc? Except this one does not share floor space with the convenience store and gas station cashier. That's a good thing.  The first thing I noticed is that the place is sparsely decorated but clean. Good! The second was that they had some interesting options -- not just \"hot dog on bun,\" \"hot dog on bun with mustard,\" \"polish sausage,\" and the other standards. I'm sure they can hook you up with those if you like. The lady at the register was very friendly and asked if it was our first time. It was, so she handed us the printed menus, which had details about the various dogs, sides, and other offerings.  I could have randomly picked any dog and probably been happy: everything looked tasty. They use all beef sausages and have a variety of types, each matched to named sets of toppings.   I had the Sonora dog. While it was difficult to eat -- just like a good Chicago dog -- because of all the toppings, the ingredients were fresh (ok, how fresh CAN pickled jalapeños from a can actually be?) and worth the extra effort to keep everything held together. The hot dog was firm with a nice \"snap\" and my fries were served hot.  Too bad this place is about an hour from where I live, otherwise I'd have more of a chance to try the other dogs. If I'm in the area again, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great Hot Dogs, creative menu and fresh ingredients. The menu might be a bit overwhelming at first glance but the folks here explained it well. My daughter wanted her toppings on the side...she's picky. It worked out great. Save room for the waffels.....awesome"}
{"text":"Best hotdogs in the valley, period! Teds what? Pffft, please. Come see Vince at Doglicious and you'll be set for your hotdog fix. Fresh ingredients. Top quality meat for the dogs. Toppings and fixing beyond your hearts contentment you could ever need. Family owned and operated. Clean, and delicious. Friendly, down to earth and fast service. Always greeted with a welcoming smile when entering and a friendly fair well when leaving. These guys are my hotdog goto for life. They won a permanent customer with me! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"this place is the bomb. best dogs in town. family owned and they are so nice. Check this place out."}
{"text":"So how has nobody mentioned the two underage children working there all hours of the day taking orders? I think it's a little strange, however I am honestly able to look past it due to the excellent quality of food here."}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff is super friendly.  It's also very close to Midwestern University (a huge plus for us students!!)"}
{"text":"I grew  up on the dirty water Sabrett franks in NYC    They  always  sucked. Not a  big hot dog guy, but these were  real  good quality dogs  with  any reasonable condiment you could want. Plenty of  parking, but room to eat inside, Clean, fast and  reasonable    Dog  haters might want to give it a try"}
{"text":"Yum! I've had this place bookmarked for ages and I'm so glad I finally tried it out. Soft buns, dogs that have that slight 'crunch' when you bite into them, and any topping or variation of a hot dog you could ever imagine. Good prices, too!"}
{"text":"Wow! If you're looking for a an excellent, fresh,  delightful hot dog, look no further. Service was great and they were patient with my indecisiveness. 24 options and none of them are \"hot dog with ketchup and relish\" Truly original flavor options which are delicious and fun."}
{"text":"Doglicious Hot Dogs are just wonderful.  So, unique and different than anything I have tasted. You gotta go and check these guys out."}
{"text":"Love it!! Adorable little gal took our order efficiently and promptly. Hot dogs were delivered hot and fresh. Let me start with the coleslaw. Absolutely delicious. Fresh and tasted homemade. Next the hotdog...they were right to say Doglicious!! Please pop in this hot dog place and enjoy the soft bun and snap of a amazing dog!!"}
{"text":"I've been craving hot dogs for a few weeks but I've been holding out til I had time to find the perfect place! I surely found it!!! I got the Sonoran with a few changes and they made the chili coleslaw for the side for a small small upcharge....the red onion sauce was deelish! Go check them out!!! Cool spot for those cravings!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this joint for lunch after reading so many good reviews about it. First thing I noticed was how friendly the 2 guys were running the shop. Very polite and attentive. Once they figured out it was my first visit here it seemed like the service got even better. I ordered the Chicago dog and the Mac and cheese dog. The Chicago did not disappoint. It was very tasty. The Mac and cheese dog was eh ok. I can see why people like it but I preferred the Chicago. Place was pretty clean and full of people. They could use some more tables in there and I think they have enough room to do it. Overall good food, a bit expensive for a dog but worth it, and outstanding customer service. I'll be back to try a couple different dogs with the Chicago dog of course."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a menu.  Blown away by the staff who my husband & I thought must be owners.  They took so much pride in the place and wanted to make sure everything was tasting great.  My husband even asked, are you guys the owners, they said, \"no, we just really like the guy\".  When do you hear that?!? Now, this is a place that is More than just great food.  It has Heart.  I will be back for another hot dog, not just because it taste great, but because they care."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is clean, cute, friendly! So many unique and delicious choices it was hard to chose just one. We definitely will be coming back and already have our orders for next time!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and love the owners! So nice! The Chicago is simply amazing. I have taken several friends here too and they always loved it."}
{"text":"First time at Doglicious so we tried the classic Chicago dog and the loaded Sonoran dog, both were loaded with toppings and tasted great! We also got the chili cheese fries and but regretted getting them because the hot dogs were so filling, yet they were tasty. Would like if they had more diet drink options but owners were friendly and we definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This place always has fresh amazing unique hot dogs. We'll keep coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Delicious hot dogs  and sandwiches! The service was fast & friendly! We arrived just before closing but didn't feel rushed at all. The chips & drinks were tasty too!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after finding on google. Had a Sonoran dog. Came out great. A little soggy on the bun from all the fixins but if you ain't making a mess, you ain't doing it right. We will be back for sure. Try the air cooked fries... there ya go !!"}
{"text":"Not sure what to say nice owners but the food was average at best. The fries tested like frozen fries and the chili was average. If this is  One of the best hotdogs in Phoenix them I will wait until I go back East to eat them."}
{"text":"Had pretty good hotdogs. Sonoran dog just barely missed it's mark! They had bacon bits instead of the hot dog wrapped and there were pinto beans and sliced tomatoes with Pico De gallo? Never seen that before. Other than that, pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"Very Good!  Amazed to find such a friendly family owned operation.  The night we were there it was dad and his daughter, and they were just awesome.   The Hot Dogs are crafted with passion for what they serve and take great pride.    Certainly recommend!"}
{"text":"The BEST Hot Dog place I have ever found.   The dog went Snap! when I bit it, the bun tastes as if it just came out of the oven, the Chili was made with beer and No beans, Vidalia onions, and good cheeze.  This Dog is to Die For!   They have a  w i d e  choice of  selections. Vienna beef, Schreiners bratwurst, Hoffy, Pulled pork, Italian Beef, Spicy Italian Sausage, And enough fixens to mess up your mind.  You gotta eat here! Its Killer good. A Fat Guy would never lie about good food!!"}
{"text":"Glad I found this place! Thanks Yelpers!  So good.  I ordered the Aloha Hawaiian and he had the Mac and Cheese Dog.  Both included bacon. We shared the chips and slaw.  Everything was fantastic. Family run business, dad at the register and the girls very efficiently holding down the kitchen. I need to go back to try the waffles.  We will have to go back soon...we have so many other delights to try.  Next up Seattle and Colunbiana."}
{"text":"DEEELISH!!  Almost like a miniature Portillo's on our side of town. I had the chili cheese dog and my son had the Chicago dog. We both devoured our food and would definitely order it again. I didn't love the cole slaw, mainly bc I prefer a lot of vinegar. This slaw had more of a dill flavor.  The chips were tasty and crunchy.  The hot dog buns tasted like they were homemade. The customer service was EXCELLENT. The decor and ambience is super cute, like Fixer Upper.  I highly recommend this place. It was hopping, glad we missed the long line. But I'm glad they're busy!"}
{"text":"This place is tucked into the corner of the gas station, however this is no gas station dog. This place, not affiliated, just adjacent to the gas station may have some of the best Italian beef and gormet hot dogs that have ever been created. Flavor erupts from every delicious bite you take. Not only is the food amazing, the place is clean and the prices are well worth the eats. 7 bucks gets you any item on the menu and each selection comes with delicious warmed potato chips. The staff, seemingly all family, are courteous and very hospitable. Do not pass this place up. We fed a family of four for under $30, hard to do these days. I will defiantly come back.   We had the following:  Italian beef sandwich- maybe the best I've had anywhere.   Mac n cheese dog- intensely delicious.   Sonoran dog- on point with the ones you get down south, way bigger and beautifully prepared. Looked like food art.   The naked dog- delicious traditional Vienna dog.   P.S, all the bread is made fresh. Pretty amazing."}
{"text":"A giant stuffed awesome dog with amazing pulled pork that taste like dr pepper for 10? And you want to go to burger king for 2 whoppers and crappy fries for the same price. I scoff at you while i stuff my face with the best hot dogs within 50 miles. This place is amazing and friendly"}
{"text":"We miss the hot dogs that we used to get in NJ, so are always on the look out for a decent place here.   We enjoyed Doglicious. Very nice owners; went out of their way to make the dogs the way we like them!  We don't go for all the fancy schmancy additions to hot dogs. I just like a dog that has a \"snap\" and good taste with brown/deli mustard and/or mustard and ketchup (don't judge!). My boyfriend likes brown/deli mustard and sauerkraut. We were not disappointed. We have tried both the kettle chips and the cole slaw and we enjoyed both!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time today. Stopped for lunch not knowing what to expect. Initially overlooked the place since they share a building with a Chevron. The place is very bare bones with a counter and several tables. Order at the counter and they call your order. The place is very clean and the service is very good.   The hot dogs are great. They have a snap to them and taste great. Had mine dressed as a Chicago dog and the toppings were fresh and tasty. They have lots of options that look very good. This is a very good place for a quick lunch. Beats the pants off a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Hmmmm, this is weird. I am eating and reviewing a hotdog place. I am not even a hotdog fan but I had the best experience here today. The owner is a delight and the food is great. Their Hot Dogs are very similar to the Snappers, natural casing Sabbrettes NY'ers will understand and impossible to find here. The quality is great. I had the Hawaiian and I also had a waffle for dessert. Despite other reviewers I do not think they are too expensive. Not sure where these other folks are eating great Hot Dogs for under 6 Bucks a meal for top quality. The waffles are not as good as the fancy waffle places popping out all over town but I still thought they were good for three bucks.  They have a lot of different dogs to try from Chicago, NY, Phili, and Sonoran, just to name a few. Yes, they only have two sides right now. Both are Doggone Delish though. ( See what I did there?)"}
{"text":"4th time in. 10 dogs down. All AMAZING!! Had the waffle today, Oh My Goodness was it delicious. Diana (owner) and Melanie (daughter) are always wonderful. Sofia (daughter) hooks it up with the best waffles Ive ever had."}
{"text":"Omg this place is so good!!! The coleslaw is awesome, crispy, and fresh the way it should be!!! Love getting the half chips and half coleslaw with my dog. Yummy"}
