{"text":"Discovered this place on my way to work. There are certain foods that I highly recommend. The pulled pork and brisket are great. I wasn't much of a fan for the chicken burger. 

The staff is Super friendly and seems like a family run business."}
{"text":"It's a very nice place to have a breakfast especially in my area. There are not to many but if you find one it la very crappy. Street feast is affordable and food quality tastes fresh I really hope it is...under $10 you can get proper breakfast or lunch. When it comes to lunch please be careful and make sure you are hungry because portions served are huge and most like you won't have dinner same day. Try coffee it's very good and organic"}
{"text":"Fantastic inexpensive homestyle quality cuisine. Owners are always nice and cool wonderful fresh salads. Highly recommended place."}
{"text":"As Im late, I might as well leave a review.  Heres my take: 

Food: 5/5 All fresh and tasty, No Complaints.

Service: 5/5 Staff was attentive and looks like a mom and pops shop.

Atmosphere: 5/5 Clean overall.

Wish they opened up somewhere else. Cheers."}
