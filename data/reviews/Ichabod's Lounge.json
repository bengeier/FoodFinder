{"text":"I hesitate this review because I don't want anyone else showing up and taking my spot at Ichabods. But it's too awesome of a place not to acknowledge. Absolutely the best bar in town. Awesome food, spectacular service and just good people.Huge thanks to Maria, the bartender, who introduced us to this awesome spot! And we love showing up on all of her shifts!"}
{"text":"We went there for the first time ...It was fun with our bartender kim...i was winning and having fun ..then a different bartender Kim. with glasses on was rude and said we had to cash out b cuz my boyfriend had money in his machine but wasnt playing at the time ..she was so rude and started slamming stuff around cuz he wanted to finish playing his money....rude . ."}
{"text":"This place is great!! The staff is amazing so nice and friendly they know everyone by name and what you like to drink! Food is amazballz! And the machines are super fun!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was one of the best kept secrets until I saw 3 co-workers dining here, too. I don't like eating at old looking places but this place has charm. I've tried and liked their veggie Burger, Philly cheesesteak, Frisco Burger, fries, turtle cheesecake, baked potato, fried mushrooms, fried zucchini, nachos. So yeah, been there a lot. Service is usually good, the Russian gal remembered our drinks. They have a salad bar but it's not big."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the atmosphere that this place has. We have Been coming here for a very long time. One of my favorite to go to and the food is always delicious.  I can not always say the same for some of the service.  We enjoy sitting in the lounge area where smoking is still available.  Great music and friendly people.  The only downfall to this experience is that we always seem to get the exact same waitress no matter where we sit in lounge, which would be fine if she knew the menu, drinks, and how to actually provide an enjoyable dining experience. I would just like for the Manager/Owner to be aware that some of the employees they have working for them are actually taking away from a wonderful hidden treasure."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!!! Good food good service and I especially love it because I'm a smoker and they let me smoke on the dining side with the bar which now-a-days is unheard of even in Vegas...the live music isn't bad either...my girlfriend and I frequent this place on a regular basis...its also within walking distance from my house..."}
{"text":"Food was average waitress was good bartender skipped all rock music I played on the jukebox so if a bar doesn't play rock music they shouldn't have it on the jukebox she skipped at the straight-up club music"}
{"text":"So here I am sitting in this place with a military shirt on and somehow I became a bad guy? The customers in this place we're so rude, and the staff during the day did nothing to shut them up, their was some short foreign guy whom I believe is either the owner or manager, and he just let it happen.. he can now rest assured that everyone on my post will know the kind of place he runs,  I will let everyone I serve with  know to black ball this place and to warn  all their friends and families,  I hope that this place is out of business  soon and replaced with a military friendly bar!"}
{"text":"An old-world dinner service with lounge entertainment.  The food is not bad. I had the ham special and my mother had the prime rib--both acceptable for the money!  This is older Vegas and it shows--in a good way."}
{"text":"Always a great time to be had at Ichabods! Come in for the the fabulous food and service and maybe get a Royal Flush while enjoying your cocktails!  Maria and Kim take good care of us every time we are here."}
{"text":"The best part about this place?  Their super yummy seafood salad.  The worst part?  Their AWFUL service.  Ichabod's is near my work so I have been here several times for lunch and every time we've had bad service.  We almost always have to wave someone down to get a refill on our water, and getting the check can sometimes take 20 minutes.  If you have an hour lunch... you can expect to use the whole hour, and you might even be late.    Come on, Ichabod's... get your act together.  Your food's pretty decent and you could have a good lunch crowd if your service didn't suck."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very old school feel. Amazing staff and excellent food. The specials are always unique and well thought out."}
{"text":"I normally absolutely LOVE this place. I have spent lot of money gambling and eating here. But coming in tonight, having spent money on food and a little on gambling, with the intention of spending more on gambling, and being told \"You can't say the F-word,\" as in F-U-C-K, after coming in for YEARS and spending money, broke my heart. Sorry guys, I'm an adult. You've lost my money now."}
{"text":"Went in here not expecting what I got. I had to sit at the bar and listen to the bartenders political opinion on  race. Just because I'm white doesn't mean I'm going to agree with you. Cancelled my order a day left. If I go to a bar I expect to have food and/or drinks, not your unsolicited  opinion."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch.  Had the chicken fingers (only 4 per order) and a coke.  The bill was just under $14.  You'd think I had a steak for that price.  The food wasnt bad but the price was a total rip off for just 4 chicken fingers.  Somebody has to tell them that their $10 fingers are on the appetizer side of the menu.  Totally overpriced."}
{"text":"I love Ichabod's!  The atmosphere is amazing. The food is incredible. The salad bar is out of this world!   The employees are attentive, friendly, and go over and above to provide the most excellent service ever...especially Maria. Check this place out!  You'll love it and will want to return time and time again."}
{"text":"Great food. Fantastic entertainment.  Lucrative and aggressive gaming promotions. Old school service and feel.   LOVED IT."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing & so personable everytime we go whether it's breakfast in the morning(which is ALWAYS amazing) to a hamburger for lunch or prime rib or filet Mignon for dinner(also amazing)...we are never disappointed and always leave feeling full & their rewards program is definitely worth having for as much as we go!! Thank you to the owner and staff of this wonderful restaurant/lounge :)"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, drink and gamble. The food was amazing and the service was excellent. I loved everything I ordered but I would have to say my favorite was the haddock. We ate at here 4 times on our 5 day stay in Vegas.  Highly recommended!  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is great, and Lani the bartender was phenomenal. A class act all the way around"}
{"text":"What a Great Place to go out and eat and enjoy your company.  5 of us had dinner in the Lounge area while the Piano Player played great music.  We had the Calamari for an appetizer, it was wonderful.  The Entrees we had were Tortilla Crusted Tilapia, Filet and Shrimp, Shrimp Platter, Fish and Chips, a Prime Rib Meal and a Brownie and Ice Cream Dessert shared by all.  All dinners were delicious and the service was great.    All meals include a Salad and Soup Bar.  5 Dinners, an appetizer and several cocktails and our price was $129.00."}
{"text":"I love this place and go often - HOWEVER - called today to get info and Trish answered the phone and was totally rude to me.  One thing like that can undo all the hard work that has been put into making this place what it is."}
{"text":"Always luv the food and our Prime Rib was excellent tonight. Our Bartender was Trisha great service. See you soon!"}
{"text":"I love Ichabods for late night cravings, they got a great open face turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry, etc... I have not had any bad food there on grave, and the best part is that once you order your food is usually out to you in between 5 and 10 minutes depending of course on how many people are there and what you ordered. Would recommend anyone to stop in for a bite, foods great, staff is great, atmosphere is great. all around great place."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Christmas Eve it was a nightmare my server couldn't get anything right and the cooks were worse than she was everyone on duty that evening had a scowl on their face even the stupid manager at the bar with the long dark hair is always looking unhappy the hostess with the Santa hat on look like she was at a funeral I will never go to this restaurant again"}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by its plain Jane looks. This place has great food  with daily specials that looks pretty solid. The breakfast plates are awesome. The have gaming and the machines are ok. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. We went to go eat and pick up food for our family to go. There was a live band playing that was so fun and my pasta was amazing! Great service and great local spot."}
{"text":"What a great old time Vegas establishment! I had the Cobb salad and it was beautiful. I failed to take a picture but it will not fail you.  Service is spectacular!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious champagne and unbelievable Bartender's. The food is also savory.  It was a sad day yesterday when I stopped by Ichabods and My Maria was not there. Don't understand and wish it was not so!!!"}
{"text":"Food great atmosphere good wait staff super nice and accommodating. Enjoyed our meal and visit with a good friend.  We weren't rushed. And coffee so good.  I don't say that about many places.  Thoroughly enjoyed.  Recommend it."}
{"text":"Me and my bf came here for dinner and cocktails and it was seriously the best decision ever. Good food, good cocktails, and the owner stopped by personally to check on us and was so personable. The whole place felt like everybody knew eachother, like family. I also had the best time striking up a conversation with a Mrs Bonnie D while I played video poker :) So much laughter. This place is across town from where we live and we'll totally make the drive again, we had that much fun. Best new bar experience all year. Francois and Bonnie D you guys are ROCK STARS!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is great.  My only complaint is that in a desert with dwindling water resources each patrons is served a glass of ice water along with what ever drink they have ordered in the dining room.  At my table with 5 patrons only one person drank any of the water and the same at other tables around us. Serve water when patrons request it."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at this restaurant/lounge.  The price, atmosphere and food all work together. You don't leave here feeling as though you were ripped off and  unsatisfied. I would recommend trying this place out. Ichabod's lounge proves that there is more than what meets the eye."}
{"text":"Cool place. I was invited to this place recommended by a friend and I ended liking the place a lot. The food was really good and I enjoyed the other people who were there. I had a really fun time."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. The environment is dark and calm with golden oldies playing in the background perfect place for a hangover. They have a smoking and non smoking section and we could talk low and have a good conversation. The waitresses were all very sweet and attentive. I got chicken fried steak and my girlfriend got steak and eggs. Each plate came with 2 slices of toast,eggs,and potatoes and your main course. The food was a perfect portion I ate all my food and wasn't super stuffed. My girlfriend's steak was cooked perfectly.The  waitress bought us all the condiments before our food came out so we didn't have to wait for anything. The prices are super cheap, the food is delicious, the staff is super friendly, and their menu is huge ! It was a little cold so if you run cold bring a sweater. I recommend this place to anyone that loves good food for a good price and friendly staff. We will defentliey be dining here again."}
{"text":"very good food the best service and a very nice family place to go, ask for franckie the best server ther have"}
{"text":"Best wings in town. Great food, great friendly staff and pretty chill place. I like it."}
{"text":"We went to Ichabods because I had a coupon and wanted to try something different.  It is located in a shopping center so I was surprised when we walked in and saw that the decor is very old Vegas - low lighting, red tablecloths, candles on the tables.  As mentioned in other reviews, the bar and dining area are separated.  If you have children in your party, you enter the dining room through the door on your left.  The prices were very reasonable (less than $10 per person for breakfast and lunch).  I had the Monterey Chicken Philly with no mushrooms and the dressing on the side.  The roll tasted nice but was large and the chicken did not fill it all.  I guess I am used to seeing the meat spilling out of a philly.  The fries were adequate.  My husband had his standard two eggs, hash browns, and toast.  A plus was the availability of turkey sausage (although there is a small extra charge).  He said it was nice - which is a compliment.  Our waitress, Debbie, was very nice and attentive.  She was busy but still came by to check on us and fill our drinks.  I would return to Ichabods except for one thing - the toddler.  She was a little loud for the atmosphere.  If you do take little ones, keep in mind that Ichabods does not have a children's menu - thus no crayons - so bring something to keep them occupied.  This is certainly not a complaint about the restaurant, just an observation.  Other than that, Ichabods was pleasant and well worth the money.  It is a nice local place."}
{"text":"Ichabod's is great place to eat or drink.  Seems that over the years i have done a lot more eating then drinking.  Home to some of the most comfortable booths in Vegas.  They are nice to sit in and take in the sights of the many patrons.  The green and mahogany creates a soothing ambiance.  The food is awesome and the servers are friendly.  Chose from a burger, wrap, sandwich or one of the best chicken caesar salads in town.  Be sure to ask for extra garlic bread.  The bar scene picks up as the night goes on.  The graveyard bartenders are hip and run a clean, happy place."}
{"text":"Comfy local comfort food. I come here whenever I'm in town. Everything I've tried has been beyond good. They have a great bar and good wine. This is not a touristy restaurant but the food is better than the expense be vegas spots. They have a decent salad bar as well.   I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"I originally went here in the early evening to have a few cold beers and lose some, money in the video machines. This was my first time here. The decor is the best I have ever seen in a Sports Bar. There are two areas, a bar with dining area and a separate dining area, bar smoking, dining non smoking. The chairs at the tables in the bar area are like someone would see in a gourmet restaurant, in fact if you took a picture of the tabletop and chairs and showed it to people everyone would say it was a picture from a gourmet restaurant. The bartender was friendly and I was chatting with two people sitting next to me. The  next morning I had a urge for Chicken Fried Steak, so Ichabods. Arrived a little after 7am, sat at the bar and ordered. When it arrived the eggs were done properly but very small. The home fries were excellent. The Chicken Fried Steak, the star of the show, was terrible. The meat was very small surrounded with a lot of breading, which was not crunchy and had no flavor. The gravy was tasteless also.It gets worse, every 24/7 sports bars serves this item, price ranges from $4.95 to $7.95. this one was $10.95. This might be the most expensive sports bar Chicken Fried Steak in Vegas. I really wanted to like this place but!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for great napkins, classically themed piano songs, moist gyros, and sexy forearms (looking at you, shaved bartender) you've come to the right place."}
{"text":"We really enjoy our date night on Friday nights  listening to your live music. Jon and Gene are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and atmosphere! This is a old style supper club. I have been a fan of this place for 4 years. Nightly live entertainment, fresh salad bar with 2 homemade soups daily and great service. They are located on the east side and are open 24 hrs. The entertainment this past friday night was a piano player and it was very pleasant to enjoy a nice meal while enjoying some entertainment."}
{"text":"A really cool old vegas staple.  Who doesn't love a laid back lounge with live Sinatra being sung? The vibe is casual and the drinks are stiff.  Anywhere that still has both a salad bar and a cigarette machine has my business!   The food was actually pretty decent,  and the menu selection was large with reasonable pricing.  I had the chicken wings and the pretzel bites.  The wings were good,  the bites were ok.    Im sure I'll be back,  as they really do have a retro Vegas vibe that is hard to come across in the age of the foodie."}
{"text":"My grandparents are locals at this spot. I always come here when I'm in town! Last night I had the lemon pepper chicken and let me tell you, it was very delicious! I really like how there is a different section for smokers and non smokers, and the ambiance is also very inviting. They have live music and that really gives it that old school feel."}
{"text":"This place would have gotten five stars had the service been better. Atmosphere was great  Prices good. Food good and a broad selection.  We arrived for early dinner at 4pm. Table for 6.  Frankie our waiter was a nice guy but possibly has ADD.  Service was terribly slow.  We waited so long for the ketchup that we finally went to the bar and got it ourselves. He showed up with it five minutes later.  This was after he asked us initially if we wanted it for our fries.  Remember we were the only six in the restaurant for the first 20 minutes.  One other table of four then arrived.  So maybe he was washing dishes or something besides waiting tables.  That said, I will try them again and see if we get better luck with the server next time."}
{"text":"Amazing! The entire experience from the time we were welcomed and seated to our dessert and coffee is stellar.  We arrived on. A Sunday evening and there was a gentleman who was playing the piano and singing. He was a one man show and he was great! The food that we ordered were phenomenal with flavors that woke up taste buds.  The other patrons were dancing to the songs that the entertainer was singing and everyone was having a jolly 'ol time on a Sunday evening. What a breath of fresh air! The hostess who gave us great order recommendations was sweet and patient. The food was to die for! Two thumbs up to Ichabod's and we will be returning with family from out of town."}
{"text":"Vegas has plenty of these places: half bar, half dining room, solid food, attentive service. The menu here has a seafood emphasis, with steamed mussels, seafood salad, and several specials (salmon, fish and chips, roughy) in addition to the usual apps, sandwiches, burgers, etc.   The hype about the salad bar brought me in (available 10am-10pm?), but I ordered gyro salad instead, along with the soup of the day. Food was hot and fresh, especially the produce. The salad dressing and soup tasted like they were made in house, but the gyro meat seemed prepackaged. I'd try a different salad here in the future.  Dining room is going for an upscale vibe with dim lighting, table cloths, and flowers on each table. You can also order from the bar side, which has plenty of TV screens to watch a game. Bar area also has a piano, with live music and special events."}
{"text":"I had 4 $20 dollar coupons for Ichabods Lounge and it just so happened to be my gf's bday.  So I treated her and some of her family to this place.  I said, get whatever you want!   I ordered the French dip which was a little dry but good thing it came with au jus which was too salty and it was more like a gravy. =\ my gf ordered the petite filet mignon which was so good.  They also had an AYCE salad bar, but it wasn't to extravagant and it looked like they were running out on alot of items.    As for the service, it was good, but not that good.  Our server had little to no personality and was way too sarcastic.  Our food was brought out by the chef himself so that was nice.  Prices are not bad at all. I'll for sure be back to try other stuff on the menu, even if I don't have those coupons."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I chosed one of the specials of the day (wednesday): barbecue and cheese on flat breads. It was sooooo good!"}
{"text":"What a find! I love when friends rave about a small place. This little lounge is in a strip Mall. The atmosphere is great with an old Vegas Vibe. The Salad Bar was great! I happened to be very hungry and I'm glad, because the portions are huge. You definitely get your money's worth! I had the New York Strip Steak sandwich, it was great. It's attached to a bar, but separate, which I like. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The owners assistant is very rude and believes that she does not have to follow any rules or labor laws because she is an independent contractor. They go through employees like people change their socks! never work for this company ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"I give this bar/restaurant a solid 5 stars, because it is definitely as good as it gets if you are a hungry smoker living in Las Vegas!  You can smoke, drink, dine and gamble in the bar area, which is separated from their regular dining room.  The patrons and staff are a cross-section of young and old, but everyone is very friendly.   The Saturday night we were there, they even had a piano player serenading us while we enjoyed our well-prepared entrees of grilled pork chops (me) and NY Steak (him). The piano player even takes requests!   Service was friendly, albeit a tad slow, but it was a full house and our server was also training someone, so we cut her some slack.   I felt like I was in one of those wonderful supper clubs you see in movies from the 60's, where people gather to enjoy good food, good music and a little tobacco throughout the evening.  Ahhh, the good ol' days!  Ichabod's is now at the top of my list of dining establishments in Las Vegas that accommodate smokers AND has terrific food.  After reading the other reviews here, I can't wait to go back and try their nachos as I am a self-proclaimed \"Nacho Slut\"!   Thank you for doing it right, Ichabods Lounge!"}
{"text":"This place is cute in an old-Vegas way. Lots of green decor and old Vegas photos. It's divided into a dining area and bar/gaming area. The staff are friendly and attentive. The menu is fairly extensive and there are daily specials. Mostly American cuisine - various sandwiches and burgers and whatnot. There's also a small soup and salad bar. The prices are reasonable and the portions substantial. My sandwich was a-ok. Edible and tasty enough, but not particularly good. It's the type of food / quality you would most likely expect of a gaming lounge, strip mall establishment. Not worth a special trip IMHO, but good enough if you're in the area."}
{"text":"What can I say? I'm impressed. Walked into this little joint after years of driving right by it hundreds of times. You walk in and automatically feel as if you're in a different era when the mob still ran Las Vegas. Dark green walls and dim lighting makes this place feel very relaxing.  You walk in and have the choice of either sitting in the gaming area or the actual dining area. We came in for a late breakfast, wanting to try something different we decided to give Ichabod's a chance and we're glad we did. I decided to go with the Denver omelette and it was amazing! Totally loved it, I don't think I've had a better tasting omelette anywhere else. The waitress was very nice and on top of everything, she regularly stopped by to make sure everything was good.   I am curious about the rest of the menu so I will definitely be returning to explore it, I'm pretty sure with whatever I order I won't be disappointed. Good food and great service!"}
{"text":"Still a great place to eat, I had their prime rib special which came with veggies and a potato. It was massive, the size of my face, as well as tender, juicy, and at a reasonable price (less than 20)!  The clam chowder at the salad bar was also delicious, pretty impressive for a self-service kettle."}
{"text":"Great entertainment! Howie and Paul are the best in Las Vegas. The problem is the service sucks. To start I ordered a glass of wine and the waitress tossed it in the middle of the table and walked away. It wasn't even in a wine glass. She was very rude. We also had to call to make sure who was playing because management keeps switching the night for entertainment."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas! The food is amazing and it's one of the last bar/restaurants in Vegas to still have that \"Old Vegas\" feel. The owner, Francois, came over to our table personally, to make sure everything was satisfactory. Our bartender, Maria, was funny, friendly and very attentive with our drinks. I highly recommend Ichabod's to anyone looking for that \"old vegas\" feel!"}
{"text":"Great place for a little of old Vegas atmosphere the place has good food fish and chips are my fav"}
{"text":"Excellent for AND service. Denise was our waitress this am. I have not had service this wonderful in years! I was raised in a restaurant I know service. The food was excellent as well. This is a hidden gem in my new neighbor. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"When we first arrived, we were almost turned away because we had a large party. After mentioning how disappointed we'd be to take our business to Outback, the hostess quickly found a booth she could clean up to fit us. After a short wait it was ready, we were seated and began to peruse the menu.  The atmosphere is pretty nice, though it's definitely dark. The lounge area is completely blocked off from the restaurant, which allows people to smoke at the bar as well as letting the establishment serve food. While we were there they had a guy playing piano and later he was accompanied by a man playing the flute.   My boyfriend and I ordered the prime rib special, an order of hot wings and the greek town cheese-steak with chicken. The prime rib came with the unlimited soup and salad bar; most of the veggies looked fresh enough, there was a lot of canned things available, about 4 dressings and two soups were out, though one of the soups was pretty low. When the wings were brought out, they seemed a little undercooked. The meat had a chewy texture, not crispy at all- and was juicy to the point of almost pink.   The prime rib was very pink and tender and came with a tasty horseradish sauce. The mashed potatoes were chunky, so that's a plus; means they most likely used real potatoes.   The greek town sandwich was alright, but the chicken breast was a little dry. The fries it came with were good.   Our friends ordered a cheeseburger well-done and it came out pink in the middle. He sent it back and the second one was a little more finished but not cooked all the way through.  The nachos looked good; they were a HUGE portion! Definitely not an appetizer for one or two people, it's geared towards feeding a whole table.   The portions were big and the food was decent but nothing to get supremely worked up over. The atmosphere is definitely the highest point, as it feels like old school Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a great little hole in the wall place that you really wouldn't discover other than by living nearby or word of mouth. The food is Great and I can't stress that enough! The only bad thing we've experienced in the 8 or 10 times we've been there is the service. I'm talking about the service in the dining room. We've never eaten in the bar side. Of all our visits, we've only had good service twice and those were days we had a different waitress than usual. There is a blonde waitress with a British accent that is just terrible at her job. If you are served by her, expect to be there for much longer than you would expect. She rarely comes to your table or even into the dining room for that matter. We usually have to go find her to ask for our check. I would give a 5 star rating if it wasn't for this waitresses poor service!"}
{"text":"The four of us 'adults' went for a late breakfast.  We had company from Oregon.  Bloody Mary's were in order and YELP! steered us to this place and we were very impressed!  Excellent place for breakfast!  Very old-school Vegas type of joint.  The blueberry pancakes were the bomb!  The place was filled with lots of old gray haired white people.  That alone tells you the food is worth coming back too!  Enjoy this gem!  When you are finished, go walk off your food at 'Habitat For Humanity' across the street.  That is exactly what we did."}
{"text":"I like the fact that a place like this is open 24/7 where when I get off work I'm able to just walk in a bar to be served.  The Gina and Kim helped me out to get food that was recommended to eat.    They also have many poker games that helped me win some cash to pay for food and house drinks.  They play pretty good up beat music.    I like this place because you are always being assisted by the bartender every 5-10 minutes. I think it's because they try their best to have a happy customer.    Will definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and have been at Ichabod's many, many times over the past 11 years. It's always been a default, never a 'go to' or 'must have' kind of place. In all this time, no one has ever said, Nice to see you again, or Welcome back. There has always been an abruptness about the arrival and seating process, and the order taking and service is much the same. Impersonal, I guess, is the word that comes to mind. Which leads me up to Thanksgiving. We made dinner reservations as my cousin, who also lives in the neighborhood, didn't care to drive far. When we arrived, no one said, Happy Thanksgiving, only, Is this table OK? Then came the server - she was rushed, and wanted to be sure we knew she only had a certain amount of time to take our order. That done, the turkey dinners came. And this is where  Ichabod's has lost me for good: all processed white and dark meat. Pretty disgraceful. The sodium was popping inside my mouth. No one in my family wanted to express displeasure at the table, but over the past few days it's all come out. It was a not good time, and I have a feeling that when the personnel at Ichabod's see this they will do the good old dig your heels in act and not even consider this Big Miss."}
{"text":"Went there the Saturday night 12/17. Crowd was minimal. Good vibe going on at this piano bar. Food was good (not fab, but good). Drinks were generous. Older crowd, but that's to be expected at a piano bar venue."}
{"text":"This place has amazing music, generous cocktail and delicious food. I came on a Sunday when no other place was playing jazz and was delighted to find an actual jazz group playing. Found out that they have music every night. Please come here to support jazz music."}
{"text":"First time here... service & food very good... just don't order the carrot cake if you want real carrot cake because it tastes like spice cake but everything else was above my expectations."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar. I've been coming here for years. Chris is always nice and makes great Bloody Mary's. I always get the shrimp cocktail and lemon pepper wings. Yum!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying what a gem this place is. We went to Ichobods for a girls night out and we had food and drinks. The food was wonderful try the wings! Chris the grave bartender was so great. We will be back."}
{"text":"On the less fun side of the Groupon experience was Ichabod's Lounge.  My gf and I shared an appetizer and two specials.  The appetizer was a clam steamer which was served in a large pot with two small cuts of garlic bread.  The clams were indeed super tasty and were plentiful to boot!  I thought, \"This is gonna be great if the remainder of the food was as tasty and they gave you as much!\"  Unfortunately, the specials really let me down.  The pastrami sandwich was salty, salty, salty.  The ribettes were super super tender, but lacked any flavor in the meat.  It's as if they boiled them and slathered some bbq sauce on it.  Yech!  Didn't have a as big of a problem with service as many of the Yelpers have noted, but she did disappear for a period of time when my gf's drink was empty and again when we wanted the check.  I'm not inclined to come back."}
{"text":"My mom and I always stop here if we need a quick bite to eat. We only ever get the San Fran burger ( I think that's what it's called ) and it's delicious. Their salad bar isn't the best and is kinda sad though. The staff is attentive and friendly and you don't have to wait forever to get your food. We will continue to go here as we really enjoy the food and the staff"}
{"text":"Very inviting... the music is classic 50s-60s fare.   The food... stellar,  every single time.   This place is intimate, romantic and inviting.   We've never,  even once, had a bad meal or poor treatment.   The crowd tends to be 30 and over,  which is absolutely fine with my husband and me.   We've had many anniversary dinners at Ichabods, and will have many more.   The staff all seem to be treated well by mngmt/ owners,  and it shows."}
{"text":"My family always wants to go here, and this place is usually pretty good. However, tonight was pretty bad. Our waittress had absolutely no idea what she was doing. Apps came out with our food, and she came back asking about our orders like 10 minutes after we ordered. She tried taking our meals away before she was finished and even picked up glasses with alcohol still in them."}
{"text":"I was surprised when I walked in looks better on the inside then I expected. I love how dark it is inside and the candle lit tables to bad its only like that on the smoking side. The food is just average and the prices are to high for what they serve. I would go back but only if I had a coupon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Bloody Mary's and wonderful staff! Everyone is friendly and never leave you waiting. It's quiet and more reserved but I loved it."}
{"text":"Our waitress Jamie goes above and beyond !!! A few months ago I fell in love with a special they had on the menu for lunch. Our waitress took my number and called to let me know when it was on the menu again and not only was I impressed and grateful, I came back and it was just as wonderful as the first time!!! The food here is excellent but the service is over the top!!! Thank you, Jamie!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem ... the ambiance is always on point live music total classic Vegas which I love ( being BAR here ) the food is amazing I've had the braised short rib which is to die for and the philly end of the day I have NEVER been disappointed!! I'm usually here on the weekends and the Bartenders are Kim & Andrew and they run the show like no other bar I never go thirsty and thy give me the attention I need .. The owner Francois (Fran swah ) is such a great owner he always mingles with his patrons and thanks them for coming he even has his own little money ( Ichabods bucks ) that he gives out as a courtesy that is good as cash in his establishment... I will always be a loyal customer here and as long as it's his place I will always come back !!! If you're looking for that Old School Vegas Vibe/ Sparkle that this town has lost ... Swing by Ichabods and you will not be disappointed!!! Thank me later"}
{"text":"I went today on my lunch break. I sat in the lounge the chairs were very comfortable and the AC was at a very comfortable temperature our waiter was Leslie  lady and she was great I had the special of the day which was the shredded beef tacos and they were delicious they were season very well I also had a Chef salad with a piece of bread that was to die for I will definitely be coming back to this facility on my next lunch break it's a piano bar as well in the bar with gambling is also available and on the other side there is family seating restaurant style"}
{"text":"Ichabob's lounge is a great place to eat outside the strip of Vegas. First off, this place is open 24hrs and it offers a salad bar, a bar & lounge with machine poker and a cool cigarette vending machine and play all the great rock n' roll hits!   Occasionally the owner of the place \"Francois\" hangs out and checks in on customers to see how they are enjoying their food which shows they he really cares. He has also offered Ichabob dollars which can be used towards food or playing the video poker.   Now for the food.. The salad bar is great it's always fresh ingredients and always constantly gets refilled so that it never runs low. I have eaten here a couple times and always get something new. The omelettes are great and they offer a variety of different types and also classics. The pastrami sandwich is delicious its low fat pastrami that doesn't mess with the quality of the taste.   I could keep rambling on about this place, but i won't lol! A little side note this place also offers a fit menu for all those people on diets or counting calories!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. Driven past this place for years and finally stopped. Me and dad both had a special. At had the California club. He had chicken pasta with mushrooms bacon artichoke and cream sauce. The food was GREAT.  Dad can't wait to take mom for a date night. It was a lot nicer inside than I thought it would be. There was a light and fresh flowers on every table on a Thursday afternoon."}
{"text":"The burgers are to die for!  Being a Midwest girl that says a lot!  Julie was an excellent server!  The place appears very clean & portions were generous. I highly recommend!  There is also a beautiful lounge area that we checked out as we left with TVs, gaming machines, dance floor & plenty of seating.  I want to go back for the liver & onions!!"}
{"text":"I love the live music at this place!!  John and Gene are amazing and get everyone on their feet dancing! I wish they played Friday nights again! one day a week isn't enough!! if you haven't seen them, Tuesday nights 6:30-10pm. Check it out"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Great service. Really good piano player and singer. I would return. Off the strip. Prices were reasonable $4-5 beer and cool old Vegas vibe. Dance floor in the lounge as well. You can sit in dining room with no smoking, or lounge. Dark on the outside but it's open!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the delicious food and 3 stars for the slow service.   The ribeye steak I ordered was one of the best I've ever had, it was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  I would have given them 5 stars if the service was better.  They seemed to be short staffed and our waitress had too many customers to serve."}
{"text":"Ichabod's is a great lounge tucked away inside an enormous shopping center.  You really have to use lounge when described this place because upon walking inside the bar is completely separated for the smokers and gamblers from the restaurant.  The restaurant is top notch in decor and offer a wide array of menu selections for a lounge.  I would compare it to a small... off-strip version of the peppermill."}
{"text":"Ate there twice this week; Friday night and Sunday morning. Both meals were very good. I liked the salad bar and grilled orange roughy with a glass of chardonnay. Sunday I had a custom omelet with hash browns. Service was prompt and friendly.  I can't believe I've lived in Vegas for 25 years and never visited here! It's very popular, despite the 80's décor! It's a charming neighborhood hangout, and one of the few independent bar/restaurants that's not owned by PT's or Station Casinos, so enjoy it!"}
{"text":"This is one of two favorite places to eat since moving to Vegas. It has a great atmosphere and great people working here! I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"To modify a page from the Hooter's playbook, Ichabod's is \"Delightfully Creepy, Yet Refined.\"  The inside of the this place is creepy dark, almost to the point of tripping over furniture.  The small Tiffany-esque lamps on the tables and huge, heavy-looking furniture add to the quirky atmosphere.  To top it off they have someone playing a piano to a Casio-style beatbox!  It's a fun spectacle that must be experienced to be appreciated fully,  I had the Neptune wrap for lunch today.  It was quite tasty.  The avocado was fresh and the French fries are coated with something that give them a little extra crunch.  I think the Strawberry Fields salad is on the agenda for my next visit.  I was offered a candied walnut from the salad by my lunch companion and it was sweet, but not disgustingly sugar crusty like your typical candied walnut.  My only real complaint is that they are used to working with a senior citizen clientele here, so service can be a little slow.  However, when we told our server that we were on a time crunch to get back to work on time today she was pleasant and incredibly helpful.    Ichabod's is definitely on my list of favorites when work takes me to the east side."}
{"text":"the owner of this restaurant goes out of his way to make sure that everyone feels welcomed and wanted at his restaurant. The food is always good. In fact I've never gotten a bad meal there. I'll probably done there between 20 and 30 times over the years. My daughter's favorite is the great pasta my son's favorite is the Alfredo and my other daughter prefers the spaghetti with meatballs with added mushrooms. Half of this is a bar the other half it's a restaurant.  they host of piano bar at night time which makes it a really cool place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"right around the corner from my house, I could stumble home if needed be. Food for a bar, a cut above, not a huge cut, but I have went there just for food actually... Gaming, but I don't gamble, smoking friendly with that crazy new smoke plexi cage they built, cheap drinks too. I would dare say its a trifecta!"}
{"text":"The staff in here is wonderful. This is a great local spot with decent bar food. I love going in and always running into someone from the neighborhood. My go to is the chicken sandwich with bacon or the chicken philly. It has been a staple in the neighborhood for quite some time, and it's worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Excellent and comfy steakhouse feel, tasty and well-portioned meals, and terrific service.  The Katrina sandwich was wonderful with an ample amount of fries.  Our server was helpful and attentive.  Tables were plentiful and very clean.   Definitely somewhere to visit when in the East Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"The food was really quite good.  It's a nice atmosphere and was a really enjoyable.  Have to come back later in the day and check out the live music in the lounge"}
{"text":"Hot roast beef sandwich, like they did in the goods ole' days. Bloody Marys that are awesome. Fresh, dark gravy, home made bread and mashed potatoes. Amazing!"}
{"text":"The place is not bad if you like not to be served! Our waitress was MIA for 97% of our time there.  It was so hard to get her attention!  Oh wait I couldn't she was NEVER there. Getting the check took forever.   So anyway about the food. Food was good not bad for just having burgers and fries. I had the philly onion soup sandwich, mom had the seafood wrap, hubby had the frisco burger, nephew had the bacon swiss burger and neice had the slidders. We all loved the food but all hated the service.   The place was a little dim but clean and not bad looking if you like old school italian restaurants. The other bad part was they were vacuuming while we were eating. Hello do that when No one is there!!!"}
{"text":"I've only started going here recently to play in a bar poker league and I've been very impressed so far, The only negative I've found is it doesn't have a selection of beers on draft/tap and serves only bottles which is a shame but it's open 24hrs and has many screens to show all sports games while you relax and enjoy their food which has been excellent so far from what I've seen and tasted! Also the waitress and bar servers are brilliant and make sure your never left waiting for refills or anything you need!"}
{"text":"This review is way overdue! I love this restaurant, their service is excellent and is a model that should be used everywhere. We are a small group of 3-4 who eat every Tuesday night after our class. The employees have ALL gone out of their way to accommodate our needs. We are welcomed like family and they know what we like to order. They have offered split salads, they make sure our different dietary requirements are met, and even our special occasions are acknowledged like birthdays. We are in love with the hot spinach salad and salmon! We miss the pizza fries, we have ordered eggs and potatoes and it has all been delicious.  We thank the twins who started serving us but no longer work on Tuesdays, Shannon is our regular server and makes sure we are happy. Frankie sometimes serves us when we arrive in between shifts, Juan comes out of the kitchen  and serves and cooks for us, Kim starts us with drinks, and Chris the night bartender always walks us outside to make sure we get into our cars safely. This is all great, and they go above and beyond and we truly appreciate all of you!  The restaurant is located on the eastside of the Strip in a shopping center. Once you enter you are brought into an old world style of Las Vegas. The great difference, a SMOKE FREE GLASS ENCLOSED ROOM! (This is how we found Ichabods) I have asthma so it makes a difference. There is live music , and old photographs that are fun to look at. You can sit up at the bar or enjoy the comfy seating they have throughout the restaurant, me I stay in that glass room!  I cannot say enough about the great service and I will have to  dine during the day or earlier in the evening to try more food. I love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The logo of the Silhouetted headless horsemen with the beer stein is what sets the high standard for me. Ichabod's from the outside gives one the feeling this place can't serve breakfast, can they?  Ichabod's Lounge- as in Ichabod Crane and \"The legend of Sleepy Hollow.\" Has no other motif of Headless Hessian troopers or anything supernatural other than the welcome mat and the Sign out front. It does however remind me of when I was a kid and it was more of a lounge type restaurant that dominated NY (*like Junior's in Brooklyn.) with it's dark interior, little strands of lighting and random salad bar. (Those were the places that didn't leave standard dinner rolls before the food came out; it was muffins or raisin bread.)  Ichabod's served up a bomb omelet for breakfast. I get the impression the rest of the menu is solid the service was friendly and nice. This is a local spot the waitress and the older proprietors peppered throughout the place all seem to know each other. The Menu is bar food and I would go there before I go to an Ihop or Denny's. The bar portion of the restaurant as previously mentioned is separated by glass and that's cool the joint doesn't reek of old cigarettes."}
{"text":"Our 1st visit we enjoyed having dinner n accompanied by Jim Long at the piano bar. What a nice quaint place and relaxing atmosphere. It was so nice to see a couple making use of the dance floor. I highly recommend and of course we too will be back! Thank you Ichabods!  Dawn /Henderson NV"}
{"text":"This place has great food, great ambience, a really nice crowd, live music, we enjoy going there often. I would definitely recommend this to my friends for dining and entertainment."}
{"text":"I went there to meet up with friends for a late night drink. Loved the friendly vibe and romantic setting, the smell not so... What I'm giving 5 stars for was the service. I ordered calamari and it came with cheese sprinkled on which was a surprise to me. I don't do dairy, So, they brought 2 extra dishes to make it up for it! And they only charged for 1 glass of wine though I ordered 2. Incredible! Though the food there is not the type of food I eat, I'll go back for another drink and service!!!  Recommend!"}
{"text":"*This review concerns the restaurant portion.   If you want to remove yourself from the culture and worries of today, get to Ichabod's immediately.   We love coming to this place because it makes you feel at home. The music playing in the restaurant takes you time traveling to a simpler time, the food is delicious and the booths give you an unexpected amount of privacy and romance. Perfect for a cheap date night where you just want to eat something that makes your stomach happy.   Our order at Ichabod's usually looks like this: 1. All you can eat salad bar! Why? Because it's fun, that's why. But also the salad bar is always fresh and gives you lots of great options. I'm always grabbing seconds and thirds.   2. Chicken wings! Choose from breaded or non. Enjoy a variety of flavors from BBQ to (my fave) lemon pepper.   3. The cheesesteak! Now, not usually my go-to in a place that serves many different types of dishes. I'm a cheesesteak lover, so I don't risk ordering it at restaurants in case it's bad. But this cheesesteak is TO DIE FOR. The bread is soft, the meat is stacked, the cheese is cheesy and gooey. Perfect.   As for parking, lots of options for handicapped parking. The lot always looks packed, but no worries, you'll always find a spot.   The bathroom is pretty standard, although I will say it seems as though maybe the doors were put on backwards or something.  Just another quirky addition to this establishment.   I love this place. You will too."}
{"text":"This review (for the moment) is for the dining side only.  Went in late on a Friday evening to see a bartender friend who I learned was now working at Ichabods.  Unfortunately it was her day off.  Decided to grab a bite to eat at the dining room.    The dining room is nice in a vintage way.  It looks fancy, but is absolutely causal.  No smoke smell at all from the adjoining glassed off bar area.  There is a salad and soup bar.  Everything (including restrooms) was clean.  Prices were reasonable and the service was competent.  I had the open beef sandwich and my dining partner had the beef stroganoff (daily special) and the soup and salad bar.  We were both pleased and based on this visit, plan on returning again for food.  Pros: Good variety on menu Reasonably priced Clean and no smoke smell Generous portions Good service Relaxed atomosphere"}
{"text":"Food is okay.  I had halibut and it was over cooked. Baked potato was tasty and freshly cooked. Veggies were okay."}
{"text":"Good friendly staff no matter what time of day you are here. Food is good and consistent once again if you are here for breakfast or at 2am."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been coming here for years  This is a perfect neighborhood restaurant and bar.  Chose a booth or table.  Extensive menu with at least five daily specials. The lounge area feels like a living room.   I don't know who chooses the muted background music, but it's my era and I love it.  We are often lucky enough to get Kelly as our server.  I'm sure if, by chance, she saw us coming in from the parking lot, that bottle of wine would be waiting at our table."}
{"text":"Great service. Good food. Excellent promotional cash drawings. Open bar. Smoking/non smoking section. Just like old style Vegas."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on 11/28/12.  Walking in you get a feeling of the old Vegas and forget  you are in a Food 4 Less shopping center!   My co-workers had had lunch there twice  recently and loved the food!  The decor was somewhat 70's and 80's with mirrors, big leather booths and chairs and dim lighting- but it fits the place!  There's an old-school steakhouse type of a salad bar that looked fresh and very clean!  They had a list of daily specials in addition to a pretty extensive menu.  I had a grilled chicken sandwich with fries.  The sandwich was so tasty!!!  They also have some awesome ranch dressing!!!  Two of my friends ordered the wet burrito that looked awesome.  Another ordered the soup and salad bar.  She declared the broccoli cheese soup was yummy!    Service was friendly, fast and attentive.  It's a perfect lunch place but I would totally eat dinner if I happened to be on that side of town!"}
{"text":"Good food at a decent price. It's convenient since it's around the corner from our home. You can even order take out which is great for our lazy not wanting to cook nights. Eating there is hit or miss on service sometimes. I do like the live entertainment while eating though. I usually get the pork chops with salad bar. The salad bar used to be included but they started charging a couple years ago. I like the homemade soups and being able to make the salad the way a like. It's like a mini Sizzler salad bar. Nothing to write home about but not bad. My husband usually gets the spaghetti and meatballs which he really likes. I also really like the club melt sandwich. I always order that for takeout. The place itself has an old Vegas vibe. It appears to try to be fine dining but in reality is just a piano bar with decent food."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day and I was so pleasantly surprised. I was unsure of the vibe and theme they wanted to give off, but after my visit I'd say it's a diner with better food and a in a classier hangout spot for the older crowd.   It was cute hearing the patrons and servers talking like friends. You can tell the customers are repeat customers who come often aka regulars.  I had a California club with potato wedges and a cup of Manhattan clam chowder. My friend only got a side of fries because she wasn't hungry and it totaled about $15. I thought it was a lot of food and the quality of the food was surprisingly really good. Those were the best potato wedges I've ever had in my life! The club had buttered bread that was toasted and I thought it was a nice touch.  The staff was really nice and the restaurant was really clean. The food came out slower than one might be used to, but not slow. & I didn't care because the food was good. They have a huge menu with pastas, fish dishes, steaks, and the typical breakfast stuff like omelettes and pancakes.  My only complaint about the place has to be the smell. It smells of cigarettes and something off putting. We sat on the side away from the bar but it still smelled. It's probably just because it's old.  I keep thinking this isn't a four star spot but once I weigh out the positives I can't rate it lower."}
{"text":"Amazing old Vegas bar! Gaming lounge and piano bar! Service was great and the food was just as good! Full menu with fine dining type of food! Love it!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere,good food in a cozy restaurant , they have a cute little salad bar , I ordered New York strip with a side of coconut shrimp it's just amazing and the steak is tender and juicy , definitely were coming back"}
{"text":"Young people beware!! It's full of old people and they took forever to cook the food."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group of people last night for apps and drinks. Got yelled at by the female bartender for playing the disc box. Selected music is chosen until the graveyard shift begins but there was no sign and she would not reimburse me for swiping my card. Food was good but all customers were older and it is a CALM environment. Do not go here to have FUN!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much they really make you feel like family especially Kim, Brooke and Andrew. The food is amazing too. I had the ceaser salad with salmon and it was delicious. You get a huge portion of fish as well. If you haven't been you need to cause your missing out"}
{"text":"This place is old school, but in a good way :). They have a small salad bar ... The rest is basically whatever you want ... extensive menu.  I like the down home feeling, the good service and the good food.  Nice place off the strip to bring family."}
{"text":"Icabod's is a las Vegas institution. Good food, great staff."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Ichabod's more than 5 stars. There are hundreds of pubs in Las Vegas. All pretty much the same, except for Ichabods. The entire staff is incredible. Especially Maria, the bartender. We actually saw her at a different pub and she gave my husband and myself $40 each to play at Ichabods, a place we had never heard of at the time. Boy, was that such a beautiful gift!! They make you feel so at home and cheer for you and give superb service. I've never had bad service and I've been going to this pub regularly for months. The food is absolutely delicious and there is live music! What more could you ask for?!?  As far as pubs go, this place is perfection."}
{"text":"Great food with a family atmosphere, great customer service too and low prices as well"}
{"text":"All I have to say is the foods great.  The place is kitschy and old school which I like. And you are wondering why the 2 stars... Cause service is crappy. I work in the area and go quite a bit and on more than one occasion I sit for 20 min before anyone even takes my order. As I write this I've sat here for 15 min with an empty glass and waiting to pay my check. I get an hour lunch and it takes 50 min to get soup and salad bar and to pay my bill...Wtf is that. Slow as Fuck that's what that is. Think this is the last time I will be here. This is uncalled for.. And not appreciated."}
{"text":"all things considered, even though it is in a bad area, the food and service are good,  nice to see someone succeed in area where most could not with this concept and level of service/menu"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! Great atmosphere and great food.. They have daily specials and the food is consistently amazing!! They have live music on certain nights which makes the ambience so much nicer too.. The slot program is great and they honor the players with a weekly cash drawing and free apps :) Also the best bartender in Las Vegas is there wed-Friday morning/lunch so go in and see Jackie.. She makes you feel like family :)"}
{"text":"Experience:  I found this place on YELP, because it's super close to my Grandpa.   Facility: It's located in a casino, which is located in a strip mall, tucked back off the main street. When you walk in, there's a bar/smoking/casino side and a restaurant side. This is nice so the smoke doesn't overpower the dinning room. It's a quiet, dark atmosphere in the dinning room. It has nice booths and some tables and chairs in the middle. They have a nice small salad bar in the back too.   Service: They are a bit slow here sometimes, but depends on the waitress you get. Mostly they seem pretty friendly. I liked the waitress we had today.   Food:  So far the food has been pretty good. The prices are middle ranged, but true have nice sized potions.  This time I ordered off the daily special menu and got the clams linguini.  It was good. Lots of clams, lots of garlic (maybe a tad bit much), and good sized portion. It came with 2 small pieces of very good garlic toast.  My Grandpa got the prime rib. It was a big portion, and he loved it. I took a bite, and it was tender and cooked perfectly for me. The problem is he wanted med-well. It was more med to med-rare.   Overall:  We will definitely be back. It's close and the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend used to go there and have so much fun with the Bartender's and the customers but slowly all the good bartenders and customers are gone. Not like it used to be. Anyways they have a new bartender who is very rude and disrespectful. And didn't give a shit at all. They need to get rid of that one for sure. All the good Review.  are from Wayback when they used to have good Bartender. Just being honest."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. The service is a hit or miss but we always come late around midnight there is only one server so it's expected to be hectic. It's a really great atmosphere. If you smoke cigarettes you will like this place because you can smoke at the table as you are eating if you want.  We always come in a huge group and it's a great place to have a good dinner with good friends."}
{"text":"We eat at Ichabod's quite a bit.  The food is good and at a reasonable price.  The service is superb, the live entertainment during the evening hours is an old Vegas treat.  They have a nice little all-you-can-eat soup & salad bar as an add-on to any meal, and the drinks are well made - though they are a little weak.  The food is great, and we've ordered most everything on the menu at one time or another...the Steak Caesar Salad is exceptional, and they have a lot of great daily specials.    The best part about this place is that it is smoker friendly.  The non-smoking side is completely separated with glass and separate ventilation, but the bar area is nice, smoker-friendly, with white tablecloths, comfortable chairs, and charming appeal."}
{"text":"I love coming here after work.  The staff is amazing, and the food can't be beat.    The real reason to update my review is that I started playing Video Poker on occasion and their Royal starts at $1500 on the progressive for quarters.  I am used to casinos where it starts at $1000, or is capped at $1199.  Sometimes I've played and they have a great paytable, but lets face it, we're all here for the Royal.  I hit the Royal this morning, and it sure is a great feeling getting much more than the casino!  Thanks to the great staff and excellent food, I won some money!"}
{"text":"Im not impressed,with what ive heard i dont want to slander too, bad but i have first hand knowledge of how they treat U.S soldiers and so I leave this review ..They will NEVER get my money"}
{"text":"Nice quaint restaurant. Very clean and friendly staff. I had a large party with me and we were accommodated with our needs. I got the french dip sandwich that was wonderfully presented."}
{"text":"Came here once before years ago.. not sure why I hadn't came back.   Just popped in for lunch & a much needed cocktail.  We both had bloody's & they were perfectly made.  Jacky the bartender was SUPER sweet.   The food server was great, quick, &  easy to order from.  We met a guy,  possibly the owner,  Franswa I think his name was- he was nice.   The place is very clean,  there is a dining area separate from the bar & I believe I saw they offer some patio seating as well.   The food was tasty & they have a big menu.   We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, rounded down.  The atmosphere is dim lighting and very relaxed feeling. I enjoyed that.   The food is tasty, however, they do need to learn how to serve a hamburger. When I ordered my chili burger, it came out... well... sort of served bar style? The top bun was cut in half and the bottom bun was not... but... why would you put the burger and chili and toppings on top of BOTH buns, and slop it all over the edge so I can't rearrange the sandwich? I ended up having to eat it open faced with a knife and fork, which is NOT why I ordered a burger.  The waitress was a bit surly and unpleasant, and bordering on neglectful occasionally. She seemed to spend a lot more time focusing on the obnoxious table next to us, who made a lot of noise. I guess the squeaky wheel does get the grease.  I'll go back. It's decent, just not omg amazing."}
{"text":"horrible horrible bartender named Maria. treated me like shit when i could get her attention. she obviously has her favs, all men, but had there not been another bartender (male) i wouldn't have got another drink. i really really hope Maria sees this. no reason to treat customers like dirt from the get go because i am female? really not sure why? wouldn't be surprised if she spit in my drink that is how horrible she treated me. oh yea, i am a lesbian and heard her telling another patron about 3 lesbians that came in and how they should have gone to a fay bar. money is money Maria."}
{"text":"Wow! I've been wanting to come here for awhile now. Finally made it!  It's a bar on one side and glassed off non-smoking restaurant on the other. I think it's rather upscale and downright elegant. But the prices and the food are beyond reasonable for what you get. I had the beef and cheddar sandwich, which is an all-time favorite of mine. They have set the bar very high with this one. The sourdough was cheesy and crunchy with every bite. The beef...oh my, the beef! It was consistent. Juicy and oh so good! They must dip in au jus. The fries were nice and crispy to the last one. Even the pickles were awesome! Had to try the limonchello mascapone cake for dessert. Simply delish! Surprisingly light and refreshing. My server, Tori, was terrific and attentive. I will so be back...and soon!"}
{"text":"OMG... I love this place so much!  The food is BEYOND what you would expect.  There are two seperate parts to the restuarant so if you are a smoker, you cab actually eat, drink and smoke IN THE SAME ROOM! The live music is fantastic, the servers are efficient and polite, there is a dance floor, and did I mention how DELICIOUS the food is?!  The ambiance of the place just makes you feel warm and happy, romantic, and so old Vegas. 5 stars for Ichabods!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite local spot. We come for the bar only sometimes or for the restaurant. Either way you can't go wrong. Food is delicious bartenders are generous. What more can you ask for. After 10pm the restaurant closes but you can still order food in the bar area with full waiter service if you're not in the mood to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Another hidden Las Vegas Gem, and I mean \"hidden\", however, it is worth every minute you search for it.  Lovely, genuine, and seasoned folks run this delightful restaurant/lounge.  Food was delicious and the salad/soup bar well presented.  The split pea soup was perfect, the garlic toast well done and tasty.  We split the Chicken Parm and was more than sufficient for our hearty appetites.  If the crowded madness of the strip is getting to you, get off of it and search for this hidden gem.  It is well worth the time!"}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star review that will probably become a 4 star review when I return and get something else.  It's a very cool \"old Vegas\" joint as many note.  Even lunch on a weekday had a nice vibe to it.  It was dark, low key, with nice music playing.  I had the San Francisco sourdough burger, which comes with cheese and mushrooms on parmesan bread.  I added fried onions, as I usually do when fried onions are available.  The bread was great, you could definitely taste the parmesan.  But, it was overly greasy, which got worse when you add the cheese and the burger patty.  The chipotle mayo was very good, had a nice kick to it.  But, annoyingly, I was not given my fried onions with the order.  So, I ate the first half of the burger without them.  They are solid, basically small onion rings.  I recommend them, and hopefully you get them with your meal.  Instead of fries, I tried the potato wedges at the recommendation of the server.  They were good, but not homemade.  I did prefer them to fries, so she was right on in that regard.  Every employee was very friendly.  I'll return and likely try an entrée next time, and I'm sure I'll update my review to 4 stars.  It's a cool joint, we need more of them in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place has a nice old Vegas vibe, the ambience is nice and the light is low; pretty good for a date night or a spot to just unwind after work. Menu is pretty big with a lot of entree dishes, not just bar food. Came here during lunch hour and hardly anyone was there, but service was still kind of slow with the waitress disappearing several times when we tried to get our bill and water to refill."}
{"text":"Great local place,  always clean, happy and nice servers.  The food is solid complete with a nice salad bar.  Great place anytime of day.  Breakfast is always delicious and fast.  It's an \"Old Vegas\" style Restaurant  and Bar."}
{"text":"Meh.  Not in a bad way.  The food and atmosphere are decent in a \"This is my Dad's favorite restaurant\" kind of way.  You won't be wowed by anything but you probably won't get anything bad either - food, service...it's all safe in a bland sort of way.  Glad we had a Groupon.  If we had paid full price I might not have been as satisfied..."}
{"text":"The entire staff is genuinely friendly, not that fake server smile you get sometimes. There is nothing fake about the hospitality here. The food was out of sight! Best burger I've had in ages. We met the manager who was über cool. Great music, phenomenal food and a great mix of folks. Did I mention that they are open 24 hours? Wowzer!! If you are a local or just visiting this is a must stop on your agenda."}
{"text":"I love coming to this restaurant & our favorite waitress Kim always takes good care of us & knows our usual as soon as we walk through the door...everything we try is always delicious"}
{"text":"Two bar tenders behind the bar not so much as a hello when we walked in. Sat for 5 mins and nothing. Yeah fuck that we left"}
{"text":"Interesting little cross-section of old Vegas.  They have live music in the form of one guy on a keyboard playing a few standards and allow enough room in front of him that people can come out and dance to the tunes if they feel so inclined.  This place has a decent menu and a friendly staff, but might not be a place for the 20-30 crowd.  Nice all the same."}
{"text":"As fun as the Strip is for out-of-towners, it's incredibly frustrating for locals: a traffic nightmare of epic proportions, and assuming you can actually get somewhere and park, you still have to negotiate swarms of tourists everywhere you turn.  Most of the time, it's just not worth it if all you want is a quick, no-fuss meal in a quiet spot.  That's where Ichabod's comes in.  Located in a kind of blah strip mall, Ichabod's doesn't look like much from the outside.  Actually, it doesn't look like much from the inside, either - it's quite dark, with strips of Xmas lights running around the walls, and green plants spilling out of boxes atop the dividers between booths (I guess they must be fake, since sunlight rarely penetrates Ichabod's).  It's usually slow, and the servers don't seem all that enthusiastic, and are sometimes hard to find.  The food makes up for the depressing ambience, though.  The Bloody Marys are excellent, and I'm told that their soups are great as well.  The menu is pretty casual, diner-type stuff - lots of sandwiches and salads.  Their wraps are the specialty, and definitely worth trying, especially the chicken caesar wrap and the Neptune wrap.  Packed with meats and veggies wrapped inside spinach- or tomato-flavored wraps, they're huge and tasty.  There's some kind of salad bar there, too, but I've always been afraid of its janky appearance (though that's kind of an Ichabod's theme).  This is by no means a hip or trendy place, and if you see other diners at all, they'll be older couples and families.  But if you're tired of the touristy throngs and just want to go someplace where you can walk right in and be seated (and not pay $12 for a burger), turn to the dark side and try Ichabod's."}
{"text":"Great food 24 hours.. A very diverse menu.   I recommend the Club Melt.   This is pretty much a typical vegas bar otherwise.  Machines, Separate dining area, and friendly bartenders.  When I lived closer to this place, it was one of my regular stops."}
{"text":"Great restaurant: wonderful food and exceptional service! Try their Monday specials... I recommend the salmon; it is really outstanding. I'm glad Someone told me about this place. I've eaten here 3 times now, bringing friends with the last two times. Everyone was quite pleased. I love the old school Vegas ambiance of the restaurant. Ichabod's is a real find!"}
{"text":"If it was possible to give a minus star I would. Three times now, once for breakfast and twice for dinner we have been seated and waited over 15 minutes to even be acknowledged. All three times bar tenders walked past saying nothing. This is our last try at this place. Unless your are seated at the bar gambling they could care less you are there!"}
{"text":"It seems that this Bar and Grill has been split in two.  There's already a dead on review for the Grill.....and make no mistake,  they really do have AWESOME and cheap hamburgers.  And the instant seating makes everything shiny too.  As for the Bar part.......well.  I heart Ichabod's, but it's atmosphere in the Lounge is a little depressing.  But depression has it's place.  I wouldn't recommend Ichabod's for a swinging group get together....but with Valentine's Day approaching it's time to consider a place to go and wallow in ones tears.  The perfect place to pull up a stool and reflect over a Tom Collins or 5....alone.  Oddly it's decor is cozy , not sad in any way, very green but something a little haunting still seeps in.  Maybe it was built on an Indian burial ground.  In closing.....I would drown my  \"mean reds\" in Ichabod's any day.  But probably not the best choice for a 21st B-Day party."}
{"text":"Food was ok but nothing real special, nice as a neighborhood hang but that's it."}
{"text":"Love the food at this place. The bar itself truly is not that Smokey, as long as you are not sitting with someone smoking. We've only ever really come late night for food. It was never too busy, so I can't review the probably busy times. We also went for lunch there 2 weekends ago, since my daughters dance recital was at unlv. It was very busy in the little restaurant area, but we were able to get a table. The service was a bit slow, but there were only 2 servers for the whole area."}
{"text":"Decided to try Ichabod's one more time--and glad that I did!!! This time around I went for the traditional, classic American fair with no frills, as opposed to last time when I went with my usual, more adventurous dishes. Had a party of 3 and were pleasantly surprised with the food and service this time around! Dinner specials were abundant and portion sizes were incredibly large for the price--salad and soup bar were a welcome change. Soups were incredibly delicious and salads were above average. I ordered a liver special, and my liver came out amazing--one of the best texture and taste/freshness I've tasted in a while. Server was very nice, knowledgeable and helpful. Yay! I'm a fan and will be back. Glad I tried Ichabod's again."}
{"text":"I was ravenous for a juicy burger. The burger was pink and juicy with delicious mushrooms, The french fries were less awesome, but I am not much of a fry girl. Tho, now I want to be one, cause it just sounds cool - \"fry girl\". Someone else described it as having the \"old Vegas\" feel. She's right. I've been here since '88 and I'm about to be 50, so I too appreciate \"old Vegas\" or was that being old in Vegas. They even have a salad bar that you can add onto your meal. There were many specials and a really nice menu. I appreciated that we were not rushed out as our party needed time to talk. I noticed other parties lingering at their tables as well. I forget about Ichabod's until someone suggests it. I will try to remember it more often."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place... Husband and I wanted to try something new so we decided to come here. Atmosphere was really chill and got to sit immediately at the bar for some drinks, gambling and of course food. The bar tender came up asked us what we were having to drink and then started playing a little poker. And this is where it started to go down south. We were ignored so bad I started to feel like that dead couple in the movie Beetle Juice lol. We obviously didn't bring our book for the dead! There was no eye contact, not even a gesture got their attention. Finally a lady took our order and then it was back to being ghostly. At this point I was a little buzzed and noticed a lady was chasing the bar tenders around too and nothing would get their attention, so I came to the conclusion she was dead too lol. Over all food was pretty good just HORRENDOUS service.  Will we be Coming back here? Probably not but if we ever do I'll make sure to bring the chalk !"}
{"text":"Friends and we just found our 'local' place -- don't get your bloomers twisted because it's in a strip mall - be prepared for a nice, cozy dining room, great food and plenty of it AND great service. We just left and already talking about when to go back for gaming and music POST meal!!!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Ichabods whether its just for a morning breakfast or a dinner or just to play video poker at the bar. Its a charming and cute little place!"}
{"text":"Had a birthday dinner here for my good friend.  I've been here many times before.  We enjoyed our delicious meal, as usual.  Although, they had new staff, and the waitress we had appeared to be high or something.  She forgot just about everything, and in order for us to get additional drinks we had to go up to the bar ourselves because our waitress was no where to be found.  Hopefully they will get rid of her and keep good staff that will be more attentive to the customers."}
{"text":"Oh my Ichabods lounge is awesome. Full restaurant area, full bar area, live music every night. Piano bar style and more etc. Ichabods has an old school Vegas vibe.   This visit I had the garden burger and frys. Not the best garden burger but I'll take it not many bars offer garden burgers. My wife had a standard 2 egg and bacon breakfast with hash browns and toast. She was very satisfied with it. Do yourself a favor and go check out Ichabods."}
{"text":"We were invited to play the poker here and we met some amazing and friendly people. Haven't tried the food. Liked the music."}
{"text":"A terrific place!! The food is superb and the ambiance is even better in the lounge area. They have a piano bar nightly after 6:30 PM and they play all OLDIES MUSIC. There is dancing and a wonderful small crowd."}
{"text":"Well, what can I say, we eat here at least once a month, normally the food is good, however.  Today, after a hard day at work, I decided to order food, a chicken parm sandwich sounded good, so order it I did.  An hour later the food showed up, driver left, .  Then I checked the sandwich....a nice large roll, that's good, sauce smells good, open the sandwich, and...errr where is the chicken, oh yeah I see it, 2 small chicken fingers, a little bit of cheese, and that's it, seriously, I am left thinking of the movie Traffic when the Micheal Douglas character has a meltdown in the fast food restaurant over a burger that looks nothing like the picture.  I did call Ichabods, but it seems this IS the sandwich and yes, 2 small chicken fingers, a roll, little bit of marinara and a sprinkle of cheese is $11...  Not so good"}
{"text":"I used a groupon today for this place.  I was unimpressed; the food seemed good, but the service sucked.  We rarely saw our server.  My husband and my sign of a crappy serve place is when his glass is empty.  His glass was empty for a while.  I had to give our credit card to another person because we sat there with our check for ten minutes and our server was no where in site.  AND the place was not busy.  At most, there was six other tables in the dinning area that were occupied.  Not interested in returning.  Rather go to a place that has better service!"}
{"text":"not quite WHOOHOOO as good as it gets, but close!  A solid 4.5 from this patron.  Went there for breakfast, and LOVE the build your own omelette option for a reasonable price of like $8 for 5 items to build it with of your choice.  I took my adult son and his friend, and have to mention, these boys can EAT and left with doggie bags to take home.  They're also broad shouldered, and sitting in a booth with one of them was a tight fit, but would be PERFECT for date night if you wanna be cozy!  LOVED the ambiance and soft lighting.  Some places similar don't have directional lighting over the tables, but this place does, and it's nice to be able to see your food and read the menu, but also have an old Vegas type \"style\" to the place.  We checked out the salad bar for the lunch menu, and will be going back to try that next because everything looked pretty good.  Service was spot on, and timely.  I didn't go over to the bar side because I can't stand cigarette smoke, so this HAS to be mentioned too...the restaurant portion is completely separate from the bar area, and \"glassed in\" so you can see the bar area, but not SMELL it...and THAT is something I truly appreciate!!  You for sure forget your in a shopping center with Food4Less and Planned Parenthood right down the way next to Planet Fitness.  They have assigned parking spots for their customers, which is nice too!  Go enjoy a nice meal, then get a tan or your nails done or pick up a pack of smokes followed by some grocery shopping all within the same corner of the parking area...CONVENIENT!  Especially since I live within walking distance!  I'll be going back for SURE!"}
{"text":"Ichabod's keep getting better! I became hooked on the fresh fish then discovered their daily specials! What a deal! AGAIN the service was perfect, they remember me,and  have my drinks ready. ( I love that) They are friendly and never mind my special requests! I gamboled after dinner  not only won more than enough to pay for 5 more dinners, but was entered into a Tuesday drawing with the chance to win $5,500 dollars cash!  I tell everyone I can about Ichabod's it is really the best I have found."}
{"text":"Amazing food, quiet atmosphere, and good times with your friends. That is what ichabods is about. There cold sandwiches are to die for,  and the service there is great. I love going to ichabods with the family."}
{"text":"The video poker is definitely a good time. Always go for the filet or filet caesar on their menu-- one of the best steaks I've ever had. The bartenders are beyond friendly, your drink is always fresh, and the regulars are always down for making conversation. One of my favorite places to visit off the strip for sure."}
{"text":"Old school Vegas. Good food, good service. Nice atmoshphere. The salad bar...boring. I hate these salad in a bag places. That is what they offer. Lettuce cut up somewhere else and trucked in in plastic bags. Veggies sliced somewhere else and shipped in in plastic bags or containers. Boring.   Now the good part. I ordered the ribeye. One of the best steaks I have eaten in some time. The steak was flavorfully cooked, juicy, and flavorful. My guest ordered a pasta dish that was not what she wanted. It was too full of wine sauce. We asked the server and they replaced it with my guests second choice from the menu. No Charge even thou we offered to pay for the food. It was not the kitchens fault. It was just not what we expected.   Service couldn't have been better. Wonderful service, wonderful food. Lots of old people. Not a real young peoples place. Keep up the great work!!!!!"}
{"text":"We dined last night and had the worst service! It was a Tuesday night not that busy and yet the servers were non existent once we were seated. Finally a server came by and asked have you been helped. We ordered right away. I ordered a meal with the soup and salad bar.  The soup is not on the bar so I had to ask someone who explained they would have to get the soup for me out of the kitchen. I told her what kind I wanted and were I was sitting she said she would get it for me. It never came I asked someone else for the soup it to never came. Now the food came and the server dropped off the food and never came back. My husband asked for rolls and butter from someone else and when they finally came there was no butter.  The food is just average. And every time I have been there the service is lousy! Beginner servers maybe?  It is always an older crowd maybe they don't care weather the service is lousy or not! Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"We used to visit ichabods at least once a week when you could get the best salad bar in town  for free with an entree.. Then the price went to $2.99, we still came because it was still the best in town.  Then it jumped to $3.99 and we noticed smaller portions and higher menu prices. . So we stopped coming. . After about 6 month or so we stopped last night as I was craving that salad bar.  I ordered the hot turkey $8.99 and my partner had the chicken parm sandwich. We then asked to add the salad bar and was told it was now $6.99 to add the bar to a sandwich. So, no salad bar for us.  You can only get the salad bar for $3.99. If you have an entree or order a special. The chicken parm was delicious,  a true winner.  My turkey, was a tiny scoop of mash and bread with a few turkey pieces. . While good, the portion was Def smaller than ever. . To say the least I think they probably have lost 3 customers for good,  and yes that salad bar was still looking good but, they took the soup away and now you have to order it from the kitchen instead of it being at the salad area."}
{"text":"This review is pretty much only a nacho review because I heard that the nachos were the best in the city and lately I have become a bit of a nacho tramp and I'm working my way around the city to find the best batch. The basic rundown: the bar is a typical bar but the restaurant is actually pretty cozy and perfect for hangover Sundays...or Mondays...or Wednesdays, you get the point, it's dark, dimly lit and has lots of booths. It has a very old school feel with pictures of old school Vegas. The server was awesome (minus the Raiders shirt), nice and very attentive.   On to the food, I hate reading too many positive reviews about a place because then it places my expectations too high and all I read was how good Ichabod's nachos are. Well... the reviewers were right, the nachos were pretty good. I didn't want to believe people when they said it was some of the best in the city but it definitely warrants top 5 consideration. Right blend of cheese, chicken, and no overkill on the chips. Sold."}
{"text":"first time here I order the chicken and portobello mushroom pasta pasta perfectly done chicken and mushroom succulent will definitely be back to try something different off the menu"}
{"text":"BOOM!!  I've lived in this neighborhood for five years, passed Ichabod's thousands of times, and never until today made it inside.  I am five years late.  This place is my new favorite restaurant, bar, hangout.  Super clean, great bar ambiance, and the kind of friendly waitresses that you remember from the 'old days' but can never find anymore (Julie was A++). Our Bloody Caesars were out in a flash and absolutely yummy; the food that followed was surprisingly fast, hot, and tasty.   *Happy note for other Horrible Smokers : On the bar/lounge side, there are actual ashtrays on the actual tables, and nobody will give you stink-eye when you light up."}
{"text":"This place has a old Vegas vibe there is a piano bar the fish and chips are excellent. Big dinning area we like to eat at the bar service is always great"}
{"text":"This is a great place . The servers are very accommodating and make you feel very welcome. The food is excellent and will make adjustments to the menu. Next time I go I will take pictures as you need to see the presentation."}
{"text":"It's a mixed bag at Ichabod's. We do go frequently but mostly for the Thursday  music prevention. Like the old Vegas atmosphere and the service is tops but the food is just average. They have a couple if good pasta dishes which I would rate a four but everything else is just a three"}
{"text":"Good food and a quiet little atmosphere I like that they don't rush you out of there.  It's a nice place to go with friends and talk and not feel like they're trying to turn tables can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"Lived here 12 years and I passed this place up and don't know why.  Awesome staff,  awesome piano player and the owner is so awesome it is unbelievable.   I use awesome very weakly because it's the strongest word I know.  Come out and have fun.      It's killer."}
