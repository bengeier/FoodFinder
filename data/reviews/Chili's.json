{"text":"Ridiculous! The hostess seat us down with a major attitude because we asked to seat on a booth. She throw the menu down on the table, and did not speak a word to us. After that we waited 20 mins for a server to come to us. The services there was absolutely terrible! If you want your night ruined, then go there. The food was cold when it came out."}
{"text":"It's OK but the drinks are expensive and I've had more fun other places.  The food is good. If I were going for the bar experience I'd go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is a decent location, the only complaint I would have is the bar area is not lit very well. All of the bartenders I have been served by were wonderful, I think there is a girl named Sara there?? I'm not sure, I remember she told me it was her first day, this was a couple months ago, she was by far the best bartender I have had at this location!"}
{"text":"I love coming here with my friends! It always seems to be busy but I typically do not wait at all. All of the servers I have had were very nice, as well as the bartenders. The drinks can sometimes be a little strong, which is a shock at first but I always appreciate it. The food is always exactly how I ordered it and have never had a problem with it, my favorite is the big mouth bites! so good!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. Good soup potato and chicken enchilada. Nice salads had the southwest chicken salad with quesodilla. Flavored teas are good too. The hostess is an older Lady who is sweeter than pie. Perfect way to be greeted."}
{"text":"I haven't had the pleasure of eating at this location but I refuse to go now after a phone call I made 10 minutes ago.  Called to ask about the location. The girl was very rude and told me then hung up the phone before I could say anything else or ask any questions. Major attitude. I'm southern and say yes mam and thank you but I got nothing but a bad taste in my mouth after speaking to the girl that answered."}
{"text":"Every visit results in a happy stomach.  There are a numerous amount of selection choices on the menu, the wait staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is relaxing and enjoyable.  We like that you can substitute any \"burger\" on the menu for a black bean burger; being that we are vegetarian.  Who else thinks of everyone on their menu? Aren't you hungry now!?"}
{"text":"I would give 4.5 stars if I could.  I save 5 stars for really amazing experiences, that way I'm not an every-'like'-is-5-stars guy.    We went to this location Sunday because the Northlake location has annoyed us - they changed their kitchen line a few months or so ago and so now the grilled chicken for stuff comes out without the 'cooked' lines and it honestly looks / seems like pre-cooked chicken that has just been heated (although not microwaved).    So we tried this Huntersville location - and were very happy.  The waitress, although very recently hired, was super nice, attentive (brought kids' new drinks without waiting to be called).   She talked with the manager to put in my request for vegetarian fajitas as part of the 2-for-20 deal and it came out perfect, it was super good and more than I could have asked for.    The chips & salsa are fairly normal - I wish the salsa was more Sonoran style but you can't have everything.   The kids food (grilled chicken and various sides) and my wife's food (margarita chicken) was good and cooked properly.  The restaurant was not very crowded, which I understand based on location.  They are a bit messed up because of the crazy way they re-did that intersection.  The bartender forgot the orange wedge on my Blue Moon, but that's not a big deal, I only mention it in case the restaurant people read this."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good price, nice view overlooking airport. Had the Cajun Cesar salad which was very good and a Keith's IPA. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone hungry and time to spare waiting for there flight."}
{"text":"Love chilis,I think it's better than applebees. But this was the first time I've been to this location I see the food they have improved on and I love the new menu items but.... I was not pleased at all with service maybe our waiter was tired or overwhelmed,but I don't see anything to be overwhelmed about.. he only had us (my fam,just my boyfriend and daughter) and another couple that was sitting behind us. He was only serving two parties...  Later one more people came and that's when it got even worse. We waited 15mins to get our drinks refilled and I noticed that he was paying more attention to the other people dining in the area than he was with us maybe he was racial profiling? As we are Asian and everyone else is white. But oh well, just serve your diners right! It took us another 20mins to finally get our check then my bf decided to just let us wait in the car... For another 20mins which felt like forever I thought my bf was in the bathroom lol. But goes to find out that he waited a long period of time just for a check and to go boxes because it wasn't worth waiting to eat the rest of our food when we weren't getting the right amount of attention our waiter shouldve been giving us.. he didn't even apologize or say anything...  Just do your job right even when you're tired or just whatever is wrong with you and you wouldn't have been given a 50CENT tip. (Better than nothing)"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had two visits in a row. Service has always been around a 2/3 out if 5...the last two times I went I'd give then a 1 and only because our food actually came out. Our waiter was awful. Had to track down another server twice for drink refills and our check. Rude employees. Will not be back to that location!"}
{"text":"The food here is good.  Since I am a big salad person I like their quesadilla explosion salad.  It is served with a cheese quesadilla which really goes well with the salad and fills you up.    I will say that this place needs a good cleaning.  Each time I'm there (my visits are spread out by several months in between) the tables and seats are sticky and there is an obvious film of grime on every surface.  This makes me wonder how clean the kitchen is.  So, while I enjoy the food I am wary of eating here anymore because of this."}
{"text":"Worst food. Slowest service. Never going back again! Our server Brittany was great but everything else was horrible!"}
{"text":"I just love coming here for lunch.  The lunch specials are such a great price for the amount of food you get plus if you come with a group they can split your check amongst your friends.  Just so happened that I left my cellphone behind and they held it in a safe place til I made it back.  Thanks Chilis!"}
{"text":"Came in about 30 minutes after being given a 15 minute wait for a to-go order. Food wasn't ready. Manager was clueless. Didn't offer anything except \"sorry.\""}
{"text":"Crappy service. Good food..... Ordered, then got food 50mins Later then didn't see the Waitress for another 30 mins..... When she dropped off the check..."}
{"text":"Chili's is a staple restaurant that is never super great and never super bad. When we were here with family on a Sunday, the food took a significantly long time to come out and then some items were cold, not to mention it didn't all come out at the same time. Our waiter was extremely apologetic and the manager apologized as well, but they didn't give any credits on the bill. It was hard to get a box to go, but thankfully you don't need to get the waiter's attention to pay (they have on table tablets you can use to pay). Chili's sells Tex-Mex at a decent price if you want to go to a chain restaurant with a decent atmosphere. I wouldn't go here if I was looking for the best Tex-Mex, although I really like their chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Love the appetizers and beer selections. The  skillet queso is my favorite. Service is great also.  Fun place to drink at bar. Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Good food and fast service, had a party of 13 and it was handled like there was 3. Food come out quick and no orders were messed up."}
{"text":"Was in last Thursday night around 7pm going out after work with a friend. First impressions were very good we were surprised at the inside having a more updated modern look. We're new to the area and where were from chili's usually have a very busy decor.  We were greeted and seated quickly. We both had burgers. They came out in a reasonable amount of time, and tasted great. My one complaint is they didn't seemed to be cooked to order. Our waitress was good, and one of the managers even came around during the meal to check on us.  As I'm new to the area I'm not sure if the modern interior and food presentation is newer. I noticed some less than positive reviews but in comparison to chain restaurants and to other chili's in the past I would rate this one as pretty darn good. So 4/5!"}
{"text":"It's chilli's. Not good. Not bad. You get exactly what you expect. Service is good, place is clean."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Chilis experience- I did like our server Rissa who was attentive and personable. Fajitas came out great and I also tried the Margherita flatbread- I think it's the best one of the three they offer."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is terrible. They told us a 25 minute wait. 45 minutes later, they said they could seat us if we divided into two groups."}
{"text":"Awesome place every time I come back I love it even more friendly staff fast service I will be coming back soon"}
{"text":"I came here once and tried their chipotle steak it was yummy but didn't last long because within a month it wasn't even on the menu. Came there a second time and got a bowl, it's very small (maybe have the size of the chipotle burrito bowl :/) so it didn't fill me up. I preferred chipotles bowl over this."}
{"text":"Just terrible.  I used to love Chili's - it was pretty decent for a chain restaurant.  But no more. The skillet queso was thick, badly flavored mush with some kind of mystery meat. There was no cheese in evidence. The server was argumentative when we told him we did not like the queso, but he did take it off the bill, replacing it with a charge for chips and salsa.  The vegetables in the fajitas were an amalgam of totally uncooked and burnt with a very bitter taste. They brought the tortillas out 5 minutes before the actual fajitas, so the tortillas were cold when the meal came. And the accompaniments were just tiny dabs of things on a small plate.  Definitely gone down hill."}
{"text":"Went here last night. Food was really good. Service is always reliable. I like that the menu is always changing. Thanks- we'll be back."}
{"text":"Manager did not care about my experience. Mindy, the server was amazing and friendly and always smiling. Unfortunate that the manager was so flippant and unhelpful"}
{"text":"I actually like Chili's, eat at the one by my house often.  But this location is HORRIBLE!! Went last night with a group of friends, food took about 45mins to get to us and was over cooked, servers reason was it sits under the heat lights. The place was not busy normal late Saturday crowd. Server lacked customer service. Talked bad about the restaurant, what she hated about the job and restaurant etc.  Needed a hazmat suit to walk into the women's bathroom, bathroom could not be used. We all had to go down the street to a gas station on the way home. This is one Chili's I will never step foot in again...the one star is because I can't complete without a star."}
{"text":"First impression, the hostess was nice, if not unprofessional looking. The manager was also extremely unprofessional looking. The restaurant was not clean, sticky tables and dirty looking floors. Our waitress was nice enough, but service was extremely slow. The plus side, the food was so good! Had southwest egg rolls, chipotle honey no less wings, and onions rings! All was so good! My husband had buffalo chicken tenders and Texas fries, he enjoyed all! The new pay at the table kiosk was neat and made leaving quicker and easier! Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"I am usually a big fan of Chili's, great food and service is always on point. Tonight however was the opposite!!! Well I can't say anything about the food because we never got to try any. We waited for over 20 mins before our server came to take our order and I had to remind him to take it. Then we waited over a half hour for our food as we watched 2 other tables with bigger parties get seated, order, get their food, and then get all their little cups of ranch, before our server came to refill our drinks for the first time. Then as we got up to leave our server came and asked us \"Are you upset?\" Sorry chili's but today you missed the mark."}
{"text":"My favorite go to place. The food is always awesome, the service is superb, & the staff is just very professional and friendly. Will always go back."}
{"text":"I am normally a big fan of this chain....HOWEVER. A friend and myself went into this location last weekend. I was surprised how empty it was. I was also surprised at the new mini LCD screens they have on each table. A neat thing to have since it can show you menu items, play games and pay your tab on it. What irked me a little was getting the bill and seeing an entertainment charge had applied. I was told there is a warning about that on the start up screen but i dont recall having seen it. The fee is only a buck so its not worth crapping kittens over....its just the principal. Anyone that brings kids in there can automatically expect to see an extra dollar on the bill...good hustle Chili's. I normally love their southwest eggrolls. This time....ehhh...not so much. They seemed less than crispy and lacked the flavor i remember. Otherwise the rest of the food was good, hard to screw up a house salad, and the service friendly. Will i go back?-maybe. Will i go out of my way for it?-NO"}
{"text":"Chili's is always a favorite place to eat whether we bring all the kids or just the two of us.  The food is always great, the staff is always friendly and the prices are just right!"}
{"text":"I generally like Chili's. It's a good place for us to get some food when we are too lazy to cook but don't want anything too expensive. The wait staff at this location is always really nice and prompt about keeping our drinks filled.  We went in during a pretty busy (but not packed) evening just to get an appetizer and some drinks. It took over a half hour to get our appetizer and when it came the avacado eggrolls were soggy and the boneless wings were pretty cool. This was our only bad experience here and the ended up voiding our bill because it took them so long to bring us the food (and we didn't even complain!) I will go back because of how well they treated us."}
{"text":"Price: Excellent!!! for $23 including tip we got two amazing entrees.   Food Quality: I had not eaten at Chilis for several years, and so I was a little afraid that the food quality might have changed. however, it was superb. The ingredients were fresh: fresh cilantro, fresh beans, gorgeous lime rice. The combinations, moreover, are truly delicious. We also got huge portions.  Food Variety: Huge menu.   Service: Waitress could have been a little more attentive. Kept me waiting for a refill of water. However, you can now pay right at your table using a tiny table top computer that makes things extremely easy and fast. It will even print out your receipt.  It took a few minutes for them to seat us, even though they were not busy at all.  Cleanliness: I did not notice anything bad."}
{"text":"We come to Chilis probably once every two months.  The Boneless Buffalo Wings are a must on every visit.  Which I guess is kind of a bummer because we never get the Chips and Queso anymore - also a great choice.  If I'm being smart, I'll order the soup and salad as my entree, and then I won't be overly stuffed by the end of the meal.  However, on most occasions, my eyes are bigger than my stomach and I'll order an Oldtimer with Cheese (Chili's cheeseburger) or the Chicken Caesar Pita.  Both sandwiches come with Chili's wonderful french fries, simply seasoned with salt and pepper.  On the very rare occasion, I'll have room for dessert, and Chili's offers these great shot glass desserts that give you just enough of a taste of sweetness.  If you can somehow save room for the Chocolate Molten Cake, DO IT!  Might be worth visiting Chilis JUST for the Chocolate Molten Cake.  This particular location has offered consistently friendly service.  As another option, the phone-in/take-out service is easy and convenient."}
{"text":"Mgmt...You had *one guy* behind the bar on a Saturday night.  No wonder it took him five minutes just to get to my drink order while I was sitting at the bar.  10 minutes after that, I get to order my steak.  30 minutes after that, I get my steak...And it's cold.  Not just my worst Chili's experience, but easily my worst dining experience.  (Significant statement given I've had food poisoning before).  Asked to settle up for the margarita since I'd been there an hour, also thinking I'd give him a chance to comp me for my troubles, but was presented a check for a $9.00.   fair enough since I drank it, but I definitely won't be back, and would encourage others to find someplace else to spend their money."}
{"text":"I ordered the chipotle bowl for the first time. It was surprisingly really good. A little spicy, but great sauce."}
{"text":"Never try to get your \"closing duties\" done 2 hours before you close.  Stacked bar stools and the smell of cleaner at 8pm is never enticing or inviting to the customer (no matter how slow you are).  Management should make it clear that no \"closing duties\" happen in front of customers.. There are people eating in here and it's not a good feeling to be a part of \"clean up\" (nor appetizing).... Bad training X 10000,  this is how bars/restaurants go out of business... This is a classic local watering hole mistake,  a corporation like chili's should know better.  Really disappointing"}
{"text":"The skillet queso looked like vomit and my burger was dripping in grease. Now I have food poisoning ... so thanks for that. I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"Ordered a side of avocado ranch dressing when we received the dressing it was sour , The waitress sent the manager over who explained to us , sometimes the dressing is made incorrect.  We were not offered a credit off of our bill even though I sent my full salad back, I am a little disappointed since this is one of my favorite spots to eat quite frequently.   Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was great! If I didn't eat at Chili's so much inn the past, I would definitely go back, but since coming back to the US, many more other restaurants to try....."}
{"text":"AWFUL ,even the manager  does not have customer service  skills. I will never  go back there.  I can't tell you  how bad this location is. Not clean, not friendly  employees, ...... I could keep  typing,but I wont, for now. THE WORST EXPERIENCE I'VE  HAD AT ANY RESTAURANT!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Havent visited this place in over 3 years. Now i remember why. Because it is a very unpredictable place to eat. You can even encounter verbal arguments from staff to guests as well as needing to check your food for foreign objects... Will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"Pretty gross, ribs came out cold and the sauce tasted like ketchup. I'd provide a picture of my food but 20 minutes later I'm still sitting here waiting on warm food to come. I would avoid this place like the plague.... well the update the manager asked us to come back and give it a 2nd try..... same story different day.... order all wrong when it came out so again I'm sitting here waiting for food while everyone else is almost finished eating...."}
{"text":"I usually love chilli's, tonight my family and I decide to go for dinner to this location. Our waiter was Sean, our food was brought to us on a timely matter. Near the end of the night when Sean our waiter was doing his closing procedures he was not really interested on our table any longer. He was swiping and clean while we were still eating. Sean and an African american waitress were having a conversation next to our table. They were talking about how guest are an inconvenience to them at the end of the night. I feel like they were not really concerned about me over hearing it as they continue their conversation about wanting to get off before midnight. I don't think I even want to visit this location again, it was very uncomfortable not feeling welcome."}
{"text":"Better-than-average Chili's.  The food was all fresh and had a clean flavor (unlike some Chili's where the food has a unique, funky, bad taste).  Waitresses were friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"It is easy for people to write reviews or contact the manager when things are bad, but it's also just as easy to give a compliment when it is deserved. I live within a mile or so of here and I go in for happy hour pretty often. There are plenty of bars around and plenty of other happy hours to chose from...but I come here because of the PEOPLE! Eddie, Aaron, Josh, Nate and Brian are all at the top of their game and have never once made me feel uncomfortable. Usually if a female walks into a bar alone, she will get some very unwanted attention (from bartenders and customers alike) but I never feel that way here. These men have gotten to know me on a first name basis and I'm not the only one. Hearing Aaron greet \"John\" as soon as he walks in the door is a daily thing, or hearing Eddie ask \"Susan\" if she wants the usual. It's awesome how much these guys care. I will come here as long as I live in the valley. Bonus: the new cook is pretty fantastic! I just wanted to give credit to the guys who go in everyday and can smile even if some jerk leaves a $5 tip on a $100 bill. So if you visit this Chili's, sit at the bar, order a drink, watch the game and smile because these guys are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Dominique was so rude!!! We paid for the check, in cash. The rest of our party was just going to leave a tip on the table. She felt offended like we didn't give her enough money!!! Completely entitled! I will be speaking to her manager tomorrow!"}
{"text":"We've come to this specific location several times just to be disappointed every time. The host was rude, no place to stand because of the small entrance and the wait time was long due to the kitchen being behind... Again. Every time we come here the kitchen is behind. The waitress was nice and tried to help the best she could but really kitchen issues every time. Maybe it's time for a change in mgt and a host without an attitude."}
{"text":"We had a great experience there today and every time we go. Its a five star Chili's restaurant. My family can always find something that everyone likes, price is right, and service was great and quick for lunch crowd. We are always seated in a timely matter. We can count on everyone enjoying their food every time we go."}
{"text":"All I can say is that you are better off eating TV dinners at home! No exaggeration! Food was barely edible, steak was over-cooked and tiny, vegetables were obviously microwaved, and the beer wasn't exactly fresh either. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is that the wait service was excellent. Very accommodating waitress. Hostess was kind of rude however. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I found myself at a Chili's tonight, due to the tragic lack of options for late night dining in Tempe (c'mon, Tempe!). I kept my expectations pretty low, this is a Chili's after all. We were seated immediately and greeted promptly. Our server gave us a brief tutorial for the personal tablet devices placed at the edge of every table, which allows you to order limited menu items or pay your bill at your convenience. The tablet seemed like more of a weird distraction than anything else, but whatever, off to a solid start, Chili's! Extraneous technological devices to boot! When our server returned to take our order, we weren't quite ready yet, so she said she'd check back up on us in a few. About 10 or so minutes later, a different server approaches our table, explains to us that she is our server's \"zone partner\" and that she will be taking our order instead of our server. Okay, cool, we have a whole team of Chili's servers looking after our table. I went with an old classic, the Quesadilla Explosion Salad, leave out the tortilla strips. My boyfriend fell in love with the beautiful photo of the Guacamole Turkey Burger and decided to take the leap and order it. His order: Turkey burger, no cheese, substitute the side of fries for the side of \"spinach and roasted tomatoes\" instead.  Our food takes an unusually long time to come out, but I keep reminding myself that I'm at Chili's, so who cares. Finally, it arrives. Quesadilla Explosion Salad is on point, however, the Guacamole Turkey Burger is in beef patty form instead of a turkey patty, has cheese instead of no-cheese, and appears to be missing the side altogether. The only thing on the plate besides the burger is a tiny metal ramequin (one which you would use for ketchup or aioli) with some weird mishmash of shredded stuff. We flag down one of our designated \"zone\" servers and point out the situation. She apologizes, confirms that the patty is indeed beef and not turkey, removes the plate from the table and assures us that the correct order will be right out. Point for you, server lady! We wait a long time, my salad is getting lonelier by the minute. Finally, Guacamole Turkey Burger Part Two arrives. My boyfriend and I find ourselves staring down at the exact burger that they had brought out previously. The same beef patty with the same slice of unwanted cheese and the same pathetic and increasingly mysterious metal dipping cup. We don't know if we should LOL or be grossed out that we were re-delivered the 15 to 20 minute old reject plate. We flag down a random server (out of our \"zone\") and explain the situation yet again. She apologies, takes the plate and then also informs us that the tiny little metal dipping cup is, in fact, the spinach & tomato side dish. Dang! She let's us know she's going to grab one of the headset-strapped managers. Point for you, out-of-zone server lady! Then we wait, and wait, and wait, and wait, until we finally give up and decide we should just GTFO. Right as we're getting up, Mr. Manager Pants emerges from the kitchen.  This is where my actual beef is (pun intended). Manager Man does not appear to care about the repeated errors or extraordinary wait time. He tells us that he's honestly confused about the situation after he \"heard multiple conflicting stories in the kitchen.\" Umm...okay...well...now is your chance to remedy things Manager Man. We're standing up from our table, but I'm not about to storm out like a psycho, I'm ready to hear the dude out. All he does is apologize multiple times. I finally ask \"so is that the best you can do?\". Then he asks me who my server was. Shouldn't he know who my server(s) were, with the designated zones and partners and such? I'm not even convinced it was my server's mistake, maybe it was the cook, maybe IDGAF. Help me? We're standing there pretty disappointed (not to mention hungry) and quickly begin to realize we're never going to see the Guacamole Turkey Burger. So we leave. The person that seemed the most concerned was some random busser girl, LOL.  Between the glowing tablets, the headsets & the Zone Partners, I found myself dumbfounded by the utter lack of communication going on between the numerous staff. Not to mention, it's CHILI'S! America's second favorite chain restaurant next to Denny's.This isn't some mom & pop's first rodeo at the food & service industry. Chili's, your managers don't have a better boiler plate response for these sorts of mishaps?   We went to Filibertos instead!"}
{"text":"I heard this place had a decent bar to watch football so I walked over with some friends after work today. The bar is pretty nice. It's an icetop bar that seats a lot of people. Each side of the bar has 11 large tv's and the sound to the game is on.  The food and service is really good. My bartender has been friendly and attentive. I ate the combo shrimp and chicken fajitas. I would definitely get it again. The toffee brownie for dessert was delicious. The best part is that they have normal food and drink prices. Even a good happy hour. The restaurant is also within walking distance from most of the hotels(there's not much for parking). If you're looking for a good place to eat, or to watch a game I recommend this chili's."}
{"text":"Not very pleased with my online order. First off, the time I was given to pickup my order was 7:24. Half an hour later, my food was ready. When I got home, my food was cold. I only live 10 min away from this location. The server did say that they were waiting for one item to be completed before it was ready, so does that mean everything else sits in the to go boxes?"}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Sunday night, not too crowded. But big table sizes. Hostess was very friendly and welcoming. Waitress, not so attentive and seemed stressed out. Took her about 8 min or so just to take our drink order and when she did, she said, \"three ice waters for the three of you?\" When clearly there is only 2 of us. (Scratching head) Not blaming the waitress, but it the booths have a stink to them, like they wipe them down with dirty water and dirty towels. Not really appealing to the nose when you're hungry and waiting for food. But the 2 stars are for their menu and quantity of food. Glad they finally updated their menu."}
{"text":"Had a great inexpensive dinner. Best burger I've had in a very long time. Will go here again."}
{"text":"My family and I love this restaurant, as it always has good service and food. The chips and salsa are so thin and crispy and are quite a deal for less than $3. The chipotle chicken crispers are amazing and the ranch is worth dipping into with any meal. Eating at Chili's is always a pleasant experience, as the food is priced well and never breaks the bank. I highly recommend to any person or family looking for quality food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I was in there yesterday with my wife and had lunch the food was good as always the staff very friendly the severs was a little slow but that's ok because they had an girls volley ball team in. I didn't mind. The music pleasant the manger was very poliot the restrooms where nice and clean"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm about to review Chili's, but we go here often enough that I may as well.  Standard American fare, but I've found this place to have way better service than its peers in the area (Applebees, Ruby Tuesday) so we usually head here if we want something quick and American-y in North Prospect.  Food is average, but they're pretty quick and the crowds of waiting people seem to dissipate pretty quickly at busy times."}
{"text":"Waited at front in empty restaurant.  Hostesses all came out later as one big group like they were just hanging out in the back.  A busser had to help us because nobody was there.   Points to him (tattooed guy for the win)!!!  The only things I like about Chili's are margs and guac!  I wasn't drinking so I opted for guac.   The waiter had no idea how to make it and was using avocados that weren't even ripe yet!!!  Cmon Chili's your job isn't that hard.  Seriously.  I live across the street and I'd rather eat at a street taco stand now."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this particular restaurant location at all.  Have written to management due to the horrible service, messed up orders, problems in general with the food, etc. It was topped off by the waitstaff gossiping right behind me throughout the meal.  I just gave up and won't bother going back.   Save yourself the heartache and find another one of the MANY restaurants in Gastonia to eat at.  Seriously."}
{"text":"Decent food served in a timely manner. My food was served within 10 minutes. Surprisingly, their prices are not absurdly overpriced like the rest of the airport. I paid the same price for my meal as I would if I were eating at a Chili's restaurant at my hometown."}
{"text":"I rated the Chili's on Camelback the other day, but I came to this Chili's after Church this weekend and everything we ordered was \"Stellar!!! We got the classic nacho's with guacamole, triple play with chicken strips and southwest egg rolls, and the chicken platter with corn on the cob and mashed potatoes!  Everything was wonderful!!  Oh, yea, we had a coupon so we got free chips and queso dip. They were making a new batch so they gave us chips and salsa for free too while we waited for the queso dip! The waitress was very nice and attentive even with the place slammed. Over all a GREAT Experience!"}
{"text":"We ordered food to go and it took forever on what looked like a slow night. The burger was dry and bland, and the seasoning on the corn was gross. My husband ordered ribs and they were just ok. They were chewy and seemed old. We had walked so far from our hotel that we didn't want to go back to complain. Even though we used a gift card to pay for the meal it was a waste!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went for lunch after she had gotten out of school early. The food was great, the service was great and there was not much of a wait for the food to come out.   Great experience.  Hailee & Mike S Scottsdale, AZ"}
{"text":"The guy working the bar area was great. He was courteous and genuine. The food was good."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was okay but when your waiter (bald headed gentlemen) says, \"I'm not feeling well\" as well as to the party next to me and then proceeds to bring the check right when my food arrives.  I expect you to really be sick and not hiding in the back room.   After leaving Chilis, I ran some errands inside the airport.  Upon walking by Chilis to my gate, I see this guy peachy and joyful as ever waiting on tables.    Look, I don't care for liars and if this is how they want to close out bills, then they can take their one star."}
{"text":"Just spent $27 for two people at lunch. Ordered the Sante Fe salad.  Cost was $10.29.  Looked nothing like the picture.  Chili dusted chicken breast on top of pale green salad and dotted with pink tomato chunks and fewer pieces of avocado.  The salad was tossed in a milky bland ranch dressing.   Bluck. Won't be doing lunch here again."}
{"text":"Great Food,Good Service! However I do not recommend you get broccoli from this location, they don't wash it properly and I tasted dirt."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Very busy and the hostess said she'd seat us in the bar area when a table was clean. So we waited for 10 minutes then another couple came in and took the table right away...  I asked what the deal was and they said open seating..this should have been the first red flag.  They have that poor hostess seating everyone taking names and cleaning tables, yes they have the hostess cleaning the damn tables talk about over worked.   Eventually we sat down and the waitress who was also the bartender was very polite. I felt bad as the bar was full and so were all the booths and she seemed to be the one taking orders and drinks to everyone. This chilis is either on a skeleton crew for profits or they had a bunch of call outs.   The food was...well McDonald's has higher quality fries. The burger was alright, cooked perfect but bread was terrible. Appetizer Texas fries..too much cheese and the fries were dry and somewhat tough.    Overall I will never visit this location and probably never see the inside of another chilis with my wife again but not because of the crew. Get these ladies and gents some help, they did a great job but with the low quality food, there are numerous alternatives nearby that are similarly priced."}
{"text":"I would go just for the taste of The best Molten Cake! and their chicken enchilada soup!"}
{"text":"this is the second time that the food and service were seriously lacking. I used to come in here a lot, but quality and service have been suffering. Three months ago I went in with my mother and aunt and it took almost an hour for the food to be delivered and when it was served it was clearly cold. The manager gave it to us for free. Today I was craving the steak and asparagus meal that is topped with shrimp. It took almost 40 minutes to get to me and the only thing hot was the skillet and the burnt asparagus. Steak was over cooked and cold. Even had a nice lady next to me say that she hoped I hadn't ordered the steak well done. Nope it was supposed to be medium rare.  Manager came by and offered 50% off meal. I told him I would pay full price and actually left him half of the meal. I figured first time was their mistake, and second time was mine. To make it worse, a couple came in 10 minutes after me and was served their third course ten minutes before I received my cold meal.  And since I was raised to give good and bad together when possible, I will say that the beer was cold, but since Applebee's is around the corner, I will try them in the future."}
{"text":"This is your standard chain Chilis, but be prepared to wait.  The location is prime for both tourists and locals making this entire complex very crowded for both lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I had the Cajun Pasta and Shrimp. SOOOOO good.. Always love Chilis! The waitress was super nice and friendly. Food was hot and ready pretty quick. Anyone ever had the parmesan sweet potato fries? They are EXCELLANT..."}
{"text":"We arrived about 15-20 minutes before happy hour ended. When we were not greeted for almost 15 minutes. At this time I walked to the bar so I could put a order in for happy hour. The server arrived to the table after I got back from the bar and informed me that she would need to check and see if she would be able to get us the happy hour price on our food. She then went to talk with her manager, came back and said that her manager would discount the first round to happy hour prices, but \"After that your on your own\". She then took our order, in my opinion she had little knowledge of the menu. The appetizer arrived no problem, we had the table side guacamole. I would say the food followed it out by no more than 5 minutes. The food was set on the table without asking if there was anything else we needed or wanted. My wife wanted some ranch dressing and mayonnaise, it probably took us another 10 minutes to track a server down to get that. The server that I finally got up and asked for help, said he would get it but he was busy with his own tables, so he tracked her down to get it for us. I would say it probably took us another 15 minutes to get the mayonnaise and ranch, at this point my wife's food wasn't hot anymore. Our server made a timely appearance when our meal was completed to ask if we were ready for our dessert (we ordered the 3 for me special). Our check and dessert were delivered together, she highlighted the 18% gratuity and wrote on the check \"Not included\". My wife and I tip 18%-20%, for her to put this on this check when she obviously made our experience less than I'm sure what Chilis expectations are. I wasn't happy about this..."}
{"text":"Went this evening with a family member and ordered the $20 dinner for two.   Ordered the guacamole appetizer which was their tortilla chips (yum) and guacamole with corn, according to the waitress, no jalapeno's and not spicy.  First bite into the guac....whoa....5 alarm fire in my mouth.  It was full of jalapenos!!! and other spicy things. Then we got the 6 oz. sirloin, mine was well done as i requested but really burnt on one side.  It came with loaded mashed potatoes, which were great, and broccoli with god knows what they put on it, tasted very foul and rancid.  Service is always poor there and I don't know why I went back.  Today was my last visit there."}
{"text":"If you ever want a pazookie (pizza skillet) after 10pm, you won't be able to get it at Chillis because \"they're always out\". On the upside, the waiter was nice."}
{"text":"Good food selection! Great drinks! Amazing prices! They now have a tablet at the table where you can browse the menu, order and pay! Very convenient! Always packed but the wait isn't more than ten minutes. Would definitely recommend this place for a couple or group of friends!"}
{"text":"30 mins for lemon wedges and it took 48 mins for our order to come out. Not the first time we've had issues at this location. There will not be a third! Just because your under staffed doesn't mean customers have to be ignored."}
{"text":"I've never been a big fan of Chili's, the saltiest restaurant in the country. This past experience was especially terrible. We were there as a family with 5 people and the service was very sub par. Our food did not come out together and the order was incorrect. Although the servers were friendly, the food was among the worst I have had at a Chili's. Everything was over seasoned and over cooked. At the Waterworks Mall there are several other food choices. I would recommend any of them over this Chili's."}
{"text":"Nice place to go with kids, I always sit in the corner booth by the window at the bar.  The tvs are on and its noisy so no o e notices my kids.  Food is good and priced affordably.  Check it out when your in the area and want a quick bite."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a number of times. The service was terrible. Chili's wasn't busy and we had 2 servers, yet they struggled.  We had delays in ordering, difficulty getting their attention during the meal, dinner plates remained on the table and the bill was miscalculated. We will definitely place Chili's near the bottom of our list of restaurants."}
{"text":"my home.    chili's is my safe place. where i can escape from the world and truly find out who i am in this world. with quality food and even better prices, chili's can really be my getaway from this dark world.  todd mcdoodle."}
{"text":"Wait staff both times we stopped in for food were great! Cheerful, attentive and promp. Food is average. Worth stopping in."}
{"text":"I come to this Chilis all the time usually but today was a bad day for them. We had to wait 30 minutes for the waitress to come over and ask if we wanted any drinks. The table was extremely sticky so we asked her to wipe the table off. And as she went to get her rag she went to another table to get them more drinks. After she wiped the table off if was still sticky and disgusting. I had to get up and wipe the table down myself. The floor was disgusting and looked like a party had just happened underneath the table. When my husband got his coffee, there was a floater in his mug, the rim was dirty and the spoon has white stuff all over it. We asked to speak to the manager and he had nothing to say but I'll have a talk with the waitress. He was completely flustered that we were leaving and he made us feel unwelcomed and making us feel like we should stay and give her a chance."}
{"text":"well how can you go wrong with basic American food. i do like their chips and salsa. the early 20 some year old waiter was a little slow on the rebound. and i do want to know when we have turned into barbarians? seriously, if you are sending chips and salsa my way-why is it so odd that we ask for appetizer plates? what happened to normal table etiquette??? I guess I should not expect much but a little something would be nice. the food was not hot and it wasn't warm even but what the heck?"}
{"text":"My kid's love the Chili's menu.  It has pictures of all of the food choices and drinks. They love to circle what they want on the menu and tell the waitress their order.  The macaroni and cheese with a side of oranges is a favorite.  Did I mention it includes a drink too !  As for my husband and myself we love the margarita chicken and the chips and salsa is the best starter."}
{"text":"This is not a vegetarian friendly restaurant. I went there and tried to use a coupon. When I showed the coupon to the server he LOUDLY stated that I had not ordered an entree. I ordered the quesadilla explosion salad without the chicken. Apparently this is not an entree. I was not arguing with him when he got belligerent and said he should have charged me for the chicken so I could use the coupon. I was so embarrassed that he was making me look cheap to everyone around us. I am done with Chili's. I will find a more friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"Although we don't find ourselves out in N Olmsted very often, we were nearby on Friday and decided to go with the 2/$20 promotion. I'm a fan now. We shared the chips with guacamole and salsa. Wife had the Sizzling Quesadilla and I went with the Cajun Chicken Pasta. Great food. Great service. We had plenty of leftovers to take home for an evening snack. The waitress, Misty, was very personable and energetic. Wish there were a Chilis closer to North Royalton."}
{"text":"Service, food, and even the drinks were horrible. We waited 40 minutes for our food and waiter never came by we had to catch any server who passed us. Food was salty and had no flavor. Had to return our drinks they tasted flat. I usually enjoy Chili's but this location ruined it for us! The one star is for the chips and salsa they were good."}
{"text":"Not one of the better Chili's I've been in, bartender was great, but service was slow and food was average at best."}
{"text":"The Trio was great. Two sliders, cheese curds, and chicken crispers! The apple orchard beer was refreshing as well."}
{"text":"Nice service and relaxing atmosphere. Food and drinks are very good, and they have daily happy hours deals."}
{"text":"Typically I visit this location on a regular basis. But nothing beats the service and food at 7th st Bell. In regards to the PV mall location..lately have had some issues with quality of food and atmosphere. Food quality has slipped slightly..getting luke warm food. Corn on the cob has recently been served cold..ordered the Southern Bbq burger and the onion strings were cold and the bun warm and hard. my girlfriend had the potato skins which were somewhat hard and burnt..one which was not eatable. Also..we were sat in a section later in the night and had to listen to all the off the clock employees gabbing and carrying on. Oh well...can't win em all. Will still go here."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten at many Chilis restaurants across the country. We love Chilis and in particular the fajitas. We have tried this restaurant a few times since moving to the area a year ago. Each time the service has been mediocre and the food OK but not to Chilis standard... Very disappointing! Tonight we sat in the bar.. The bar tender was not very friendly. We asked for fajitas with extra crispy onions... The steak was tough... The chicken was barely cooked and it looked like the peppers and onions were thrown on at the last minute! We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I knew when I walked in the restaurant on west charleston in Las Vegas nv last night about 5:40 and the booths and the seats were filthy. I asked the hosted to clean it. She never came back. We sat there at least 10 minutes asking for a glass of water and some service but one would even come to the table. and then after a while  I gave up ! Since I am handicap I can not get up and hunt down a server   We decided to leave and on the way out I explained to the hostess that we could not get any service and we were going to leave and she said oh ok!!!  Is this how you handle your customer service ?  I am very disappointed! I guess one customer means nothing to you. Is this the way your employees are trained?  There were not one employee that was rude but all that I spoke to  I wanted to make you aware of these issues  Sorry for your issues. Hope you can fix them. I know I am done coming there. There are too many choices in this area that will treat the customers right!"}
{"text":"wish they would come up with negative stars.  when will management get that they have a seriously bad wait staff. Bartenders are the worst I have ever experienced. Wait staff are rude and slow.  food is OK not great but not bad. oh also these comments are when the place is half full, I could only imagine what the service is like when they are busy. management if your reading this hit me up when you do something about your horrible bartender and wait staff because I really like chilis."}
{"text":"Poor customer service from the waitress... Then mgmt. Did not even think to get another waitress to assist a party of 12. Had to keep asking for napkins, water, order a daquari was told going to get it...then 15 min later I asked a manger what I was waiting for...tell me why she brought a melted daquari to me! The order was not taken properly...the waitress seem to be oblivious to her job description.... Very dissatisfied with service...I will be contacting corporate offices"}
{"text":"They removed the one thing that you couldn't get elsewhere in Western PA (Chicken Fried Steak). Without that,  they're just another national chain with nothing that stands out and that uses too much salt.   We used to eat here very often (I had the dukedom here easily)  but I walked out the night I found out they changed the menu and won't darken their door ever again."}
{"text":"Horrible and the worst ever customer service. Took my sister's and mom out on Saturday for dinner and three people walked past us at the door after standing for 10 mins someone asks have u been helped and we said no oh okay I will be right back he comes back and to seat four I have to clean a table we said okay and then the other hostess comes up and we ask her how much longer til we are seated and she takes her Starbucks and ignores us so we decided to walk out she comes back up and say have a great day. Who trains customer service at that place they are horrible and should find a different job"}
{"text":"Place is starting to go downhill. Lots of new servers now and they seem to all be learning how to wait tables, so they aren't that good.  Orders get messed up more often and the food isn't as good as it used to be.  Same goes for takeout. The place just isn't what it used to be.  We won't be back for awhile, which is a shame, because we used to be regulars!"}
{"text":"How do you review a National chain like this? The food is...well, Chili's. If you like eating at other Chili's you will like this (duh). I give it four stars because it is very nice on the inside and not nearly as tacky as most other Chili's, the atmosphere is cool and modern."}
{"text":"Chilli's food is the same but some of the Chilli's in the area give subpar service so I would like to give a shout out to the chilli's that gave excellent service. I go into this Chilli's often and I have always received above and beyond service. If you go to any Chilli's go to this one."}
{"text":"I had lunch there on Friday, I had the lunch burger and a salad. That after noon I had gotten the worst bubble guts ever.  I don't recommend going there. The service was great"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this chilis, the draught beer is stagnant. If your in the area go to O'Charlies, next door, Layla will treat you right."}
{"text":"Went to have a quick bite to eat with a friend.  Just love their chips and salsa!  My meal was just OK, nothing great.  I do not care for margarine or a melted butter/soybean oil spread on mashed potatoes.  Whatever hapenned to real butter?  At the end of our meal, there was a roach strolled on the wall over our booth.  Yikes!  I ran into the kitchen to notify them.  Some guy, I hope it wasn't the cook, came out and killed him at the next table as his stroll was a long one...  They did comp out meal, but geez, call the exterminator!"}
{"text":"What is the point to order 45 min prior to arriving to the restaurant to pick up dinner and if you still have to wait 30 minutes?  Used the website to order for a 7 o'clock pick up and got shafted. Worst service ever. Got skipped over multiple times. Finally got our food after the server was reminded a second time. Not surprised it was cold."}
{"text":"There I was driving down the street...the taste of a crisp presidente margarita already in my mouth. Eagerly, I pulled into the parking lot with the hope of satisfying my craving and indulging in the many delicacies they have to offer. I looked at my watch 9:30pm, I had an hour to carry out my zealous moment of eating. A shorter gentleman with grayish hair on the sides sat me and my companion. Ecstatic I looked through the menu planning what would serve as my prey to this evening. Without hesitation I know I wanted TWO Presidente Margaritas...original...and then I would experiment tonite with...MANGO. I giggled to myself with anticipation and talked of my choices with my companion. Next thing I knew...it was 9:50pm and no one had even come by to ask of my choice of beverage. Fearing they day would end without me finding nourishment I retreated to an all to familiar enclave of eatery...Born And Raised, next to the Winchell's Doughuts. It was there I was brought back to life with proper nourishment...about $60 worth"}
{"text":"Be forewarned. This restaurant has a new device at the table that allows you to play games, reorder drinks and pay your bill. However it has teaser ads for the games and if you press the screen at all it will charge you to play. There are a ton of bars in the area (Native New Yorker, etc.) that allow the trivia play for free. Nice try Chili's but I will never touch that thing again."}
{"text":"I had a problem with being seated in the restaurant but offered the Happy Hour prices.  Apparently our server did not know the Happy Hour menu and brought us all the items NOT on the HH menu.  I was annoyed that the manager there would not do anything about it but the general manager made up for it by appologizing and giving us gift certificated to make up for the high bill."}
{"text":"Food sucks !!!! I ask for a media well steak , it was super over cook, at the point it was burt !!! Service was good , food is sooo bad !!! Save your money and go to TGIF !"}
{"text":"The service was about as bad as it gets. The food wasn't very good either. I thought that the remodel looked great but the service killed any chance they had for our return."}
{"text":"The food is great but this place is close to being like applebees and that's bad, horrible service and very rude, I tip very well but they don't deserve it, I rather tip the cooks"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while but giving it another chance. 2 for$20. Texas cheese fries hot and crispy, Quesadilla Explosion salad decent, kid scarfed ribs so pretty happy. Noisy though."}
{"text":"N?ce margarita bad food."}
{"text":"Christina the bartender is the best.  She is very fast and friendly, never misses a beat.  Cameo is amazing as well.  You must make sure you sit in the bar area at either one of their sections.  They make you feel like your at home."}
{"text":"No coors light No Dos XX they where out on Sunday night I got a beer bottle 3 moths expired food took 45 minutes and was cold"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgraceful. What can you say when the manager of the place chases your wife to the car screaming and yelling for absolutely no reason.  We paid our bill and left a 25% tip, only to be verbally assaulted by an absolutely sorry excuse for a manager. NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times.  Lately, the service has not been up to par.  Ordered a coffee, waited to place my order & get a refill.   No one showed so I finally got up to leave.  Cost $3.50 for a coffee, no refill, service & no food order.  Not good Chillis!  There are many other places to eat at the airport."}
{"text":"Took my family there. Usually we get good service. Usually food is cooked and well prepared. Well not on that night. Went and ordered and my wife's meat wasnt cooked well done. They took it back and microwaved it!! That drew the line. Not only that they just threw everything on our plates. Waiter seem not to care. Maybe we will go back if they improved. Maybe not.."}
{"text":"greeter to seat us had a poor attitude like he did not want to be there also the waitress with the big disney pen was terrible was acting like she was from another planet never checked on us after food was brought out and we had to seek the manager to get our check and food was average."}
{"text":"Rude service and employees! I places an order by phone for the carside to go service. I drive into the spot for take out orders and I'm sitting there for 10 mins. I called to see why hadn't anyone been out to give me my order and the guy told me to just come in. I have been to chilis in 2 other states and the servers always come out to give customers their orders. What's the purpose of having carside at this location if they force you to come in and pick up your order? The server was beyond impolite and I defiantly will not return to this location."}
{"text":"By far, experienced the best customer service experience ever! Brent was absolutely amazing and really knows how to treat his first time guests. He was hip, he was cool, and although we had a little issued he handled it like a real BOSS! Salute to you Brent! Because of his phenomenal service I will be making sure THIS Chilis is my frequent go-to! Thanks again Brent! We really appreciated the experience!"}
{"text":"Low standards are standard here.  I guess it was my fault for going to Chili's (yes I said it), but it was near the AMC theater for the Star Wars premiere.  We ordered the queso to start. It comes out about 90 seconds after ordering, which is odd, but whatever. It came out with a large area of dark brown film, which I think is disgusting. I couldn't believe the server brought it to us like that. So I started looking around and luckily another server came to the rescue. When I pointed it out, she defended it by saying that's just what happens to the cheese after some time.  Tip: even though it's queso, please do me the courtesy of removing the nasty brown film and pretending it's fresh, even though it obviously isn't.  When our server came, I told him about the situation. He also said the same thing, almost verbatim, defending it. He said \"that's just what happens when it dries out\" ..which is laughable. Are you seriously saying these words to me? You're acknowledging that it's not fresh? Okay, thanks. He literally didn't care. He shrugged it off. Then he started patronizing us about the chips. He said that we could keep the chips and salsa without the queso.. He definitely wanted to charge us for it. We got a weird vibe like we were no longer welcome, and just asked him to take it. We paid, and left.   Then he yelled halfway across the restaurant, \"what, you guys are leaving?\"   Yes, Juan. We're leaving. Six minutes into our dinner.  Went to Macaroni Grill next door and are currently having a fantastic time. Happy to bring our money elsewhere.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"***Credit Card Fraud Alert*** I dined in the bar area at Chili's on a Saturday night in late September. I paid with my credit card and wrote in an 18% tip on the receipt. Three weeks later I received my credit card bill and found out my 18% tip somehow got turned into a 70% tip. I went by the very next day and spoke with manager Becky Lane. She assured me they would refund the charges and I would hear from her when that happens, 5-7 business days in her words. Two weeks went by and nothing... So I sent an email. That went ignored. Another week passed and a second email has gone ignored. A stop by the restaurant yielded a conversation with a manager that new nothing of the situation.  Initially I wasn't upset. I figured it must've been an honest mistake by a busy bartender on a Saturday. However, the more I get the runaround the more I feel this Chili's location is trying to hide something. My next step is to contact Chili's corporate offices.  If you eat here, save your receipt and be careful of fraudulent credit card charges."}
{"text":"there's only one reason i come to Chili's and it's their to die for  Southwestern eggrolls.  delish!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  I thought the food was pretty good for a chain.  Over the last year or so, the food has gone downhill.  I've been to both Arboreteum and Blakeney.  They have stopped washing the lettuce in the salads.  They have the bagged salad taste.  I had to send a salad back because the lettuce was partially rotten.  It looked like they tried to stretch the lettuce another day.  Also ordered buffalo wings.  They came out slimy and gross at Blakeney.  Overall I no longer recommend Chilis.  I guess with the economy shortcuts and food quality have suffered."}
{"text":"The service was very slow, which got us a free desert.  I am not sure that was worth it."}
{"text":"I go to this Chili's pretty often. I think there service is great. Every time I go there the service is great. Our server makes sure we are taken care of and always full drinks. I pretty much eat the same thing every time that I go there. SHRIMP TACOS!!! lol I would recommend this chili's to anyone who lives in this area of phoenix"}
{"text":"I like chili's m, its one of nice places to go . But my experience in this place was different, the portions of the appetizers was smaller than any other branch, the waiters are just doing the minimal job requirement, i mean they just smile on your face and change their facial expression the second they turn around.I think they are not trained professionally.   I hope the management to improve , because its sad to see all of this bad reviews on one my favorite restaurant .  To be fair , the this restaurant has a nice open areas  and a good location."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here somewhat often. The food is always good, service is ok at best. Always understaffed. We just left here without even being sat down on a Friday night. Bar area had 5 tables that were empty but filthy and in desperate need of busing. The floor in the restaurant and bar was littered with trash. Not a single employee cleaning anything. No manager to be seen. Good food, needs better management. Hesitant to come back."}
{"text":"We were celebrating our 5 year anniversary and wanted something good & simple. This is not what we received on our plates. My fiancé ordered the 10oz sirloin (medium-well) with steamed broccoli and pan seared mashed potatoes and I ordered the Sizzling Fajitas with Shrimp & Chicken along with 2-salads w/ ranch dressing. When the Fajitas came out sizzling, my mouth watered. I truly love green peppers and onions. I could tell the chicken strips were cold when I looked at them because they looked as if they came straight out the freezer. I pulled one off my plate and it was cold. Did I mention is came out sizzling? My fiancé's steak was fully cooked and tasted like cardboard. I called the waiter over to the table and asked him to touch the chicken strip and he apologized and got the manager. The manager came over and I asked him to feel the strips also, he admitted they were cold. He offered to re-make the food but it would've put us behind on other things we had planned so we declined. I couldn't event finish my meal and neither could my fiancé, so we boxed our things and left. My frustration is we ended up leaving and going to another restaurant later and spending twice what we planned. With today's economy, I only go to places that deliver on what they offer. There was no reason for me to blow money on something I was not able to consume. We took the food and fed it to our dogs when we got home the next day."}
{"text":"The service is absolutely terrible. They have literally forgotten the top bun to my sandwich before.  The food is overpriced, makes my stomach hurt and me feel sick, and it gives me the shits.  The hours are terrible, especially for a restaurant on a college campus.  I only go because there are no other options."}
{"text":"The service here is usually pretty mediocre along with the food but i continue to come here from time to time when when I'm out, hungry and want something affordable. Better than fast food I suppose.  First off, it's like whoever they hire as a host at the front is usually someone who hates their job...or life in general. Tonight just annoyed me enough to write a review and never come back. We waited half an hour longer that we were told we would wait. The host was rude and useless. Whenever he called out a party's name, it was like he was whispering in church *eye roll* the other customers waiting repeated the names for him cuz sure as hell nobody heard him say it the first time. This is the umteenth time this location is \"short staffed with servers\" and \"no manager is available to speak with.\" There were 7 parties before me that just ended up leaving in frustration. The only good that came out of that is it probably made our wait 45 mins long instead of an hour!"}
{"text":"Food was prepared perfectly and in a timely manner. Our service was outstanding. We had a delightful server named Samantha who went out of her way to make our lunch enjoyable. It's nice to know you can count on consistency of a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Despite some rough reviews here, for 2 nights in a row...nothing but a great experience from top to bottom. Close, walking distance from Crowne Plaza. Immediate seating. Prompt attention. Ben, the waiter, took 8 orders - never wrote anything down - and each was exactly right; even the little details like 'no lemon', or something 'on the side'. Quite remarkable, really!  Buffalo Chicken Ranch was really tasty. Ben even remembered the next night what I had the previous night. Second night, sIrloin steak, (cooked to order), w/his recommendation of loaded mashed potatoes, was a great combo.  Plenty of food, good prices, excellent service, clean. Go for it!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't have time to go to the bigger chili's at the airport (my gate was opposite) so we tried this one! My review may be a tad bias because this is my favorite restaurant and we don't have them in Canada...but I have to say I still had the BEST burger I've ever had here (Mushroom Swiss)!!! The wait was about 15 minutes which was the only downside, but it was worth it! The staff was exceptionally nice/patient while we paid with the rest of our smaller US currency! This is a great place to eat and I hope they come to Canada in the future ;) We'll be back asap!!!!"}
{"text":"You know I came to Chili's expecting a mediocre meal.... and instead I received a very above average decent meal. And for that, Chili's gets my 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I am a regular here and have generally had better experiences than noted in the other reviews; ask for Jeremy or Mary or Adam, for example, and you'll be very well served.   The food is usually very good, though on rare occasions something will miss the mark (such as the salad lettuce being a bit frost-bitten or the burger being not quite as ordered); however, they will fix these things quickly, so give them a chance. A good place for lunch as chains go, and I'd certainly rank it above Applebee's across the street, and a notch above Red Slobsters and Olive Farten's, for example. However, the menu is, as the name suggests, very southwest-centric, so it that's not your taste then your choices will be limited. Just know that you are in a casual chain restaurant and don't expect miracles: it's food, dude, not cuisine!  Very friendly and reliable staff on the bar side--I'd recommend that area for consistency over the restaurant side. Free newspapers and wifi (though occasionally it craps out)."}
{"text":"The food is great and the servers are wonderful! But the bathrooms are very dirty and the floors are as well. They should clean the floors with a steam cleaner."}
{"text":"Wow have been waiting 15 min for service.  Wow waited 30 minutes for our meal. Wow got overcharged for lunch fajitas by $5. Wow will not be back to this Chili's."}
{"text":"Not washing hands!!! 90.5 restaurant inspection,  need I say more? Yukkk. Read the inspection notes."}
{"text":"My experience here the other day was nothing short of terrible. Me and a friend ordered burgers and nachos, to go. Which seemed simple enough but sadly wasn't. The order took 45 minutes longer then they said it would. When we got home the two medium rare burgers were burnt to a crisp. One of the burgers was a different one then we ordered and the other was missing the fries that came with it. The nachos were stale and cold. I understand this place is new but i've never had an order this botched, even at fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"First arrived and then Waited for over 20 minutes, then had to fetch our server, then had to wave someone down everytime we wanted to have service. They have buttons in the restaurant to \"ring the waiter\" which we found out don't work via one of the \"servers\" we had. This was the worst service ever, chilis has no standards."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Chili's in a few years, but after a hard week a friend asked to go there for margaritas and lunch and so I agreed to it.   In the past I haven't been much of a fan of the place, the food tasted like they were cutting corners in some places and their steak was not good, I'd rather toss one on the grill at home. Upon arrival it looked exactly as I had remembered, the standard Chili's look.  They had a new menu, including some smaller portion lunch fare.  I had a bacon cheeseburger, the menu had very few exciting items on it, it was mostly stuff you would see at other similar type restaurants.   The food was average, not disappointing and along with the great company it was a comfortable place to hang out."}
{"text":"By far the worst service I have ever received. Had to wait 7 minutes before our drink order was taken at that point we were ready to order. Then took another 8 minutes to get our drinks! 30 minutes on our food for 2 people is ridiculous. And to top it all off our food was wrong. I come here often and I have to say this may be the last time. I have been in the restaurant business for 4 years. Unexceptable."}
{"text":"Literally the worst Chili's I've ever been to.  Came at around 2pm on a Sunday with a couple friends. Off time- too early for dinner but late for a lunch and the restaurant seemed slow.  We ordered apps and those came out after about 10 min. We ordered a burger, chicken crisper, and the Cajun pasta as our meals. Took about 45 min to come out AND my friend had a hair on her burger. The waitress apologized and ordered another one for us. We checked our bill and they charged twice for the burger. One of the other waitresses came out and said they would comp my friends burger. When the check came out they still didn't fix it. So we had to ask again.  Also it doesn't help that the service was super slow, drinks took forever to get filled. Oh and by the way the health inspector was there apparently! Hairs on food when the health inspector is there? I can only imagine what happens when they aren't!  The rest of the food was standard Chili's food- but with the terrible service (and hygiene apparently) we will NOT be coming back."}
{"text":"That review about bad management is right on. We ate here 4 months ago and the server was a sweetie. Came back today with the same party of 8. There were several open tables to the right but most were booths that could not be moved.  To the left were plenty of tables that could be moved together. Hostess said she needed to see if manager would let us sit there because it was a closed section and they did not have 2 tables in the other section they could put together for us. She came back 5 minutes later and said manager would not open that section for us to eat together. I asked, \"so are you saying you want us to go somewhere else to eat?\" Her response,was something to the effect that perhaps a big booth Might open up in 20 minutes (but no real eagerness to commit to that either).   Sent hubby to Cheddars next door and even though they were much busier than chili's that pulled 2 tables together in no time.  As I sat in chili's waiting for an update, I watching several others people come in and get seated immediately. The problem was not they were too busy, it was that they did not want to put seats together in the closed section. They expected us to wait for their convenience.   Two things: managers that don't want to accommodate people should come tell them--not send the message through a high schooler.   If you don't want to seat people quickly don't build a building with all those seats to the left. Yes, I understand it is an inconvenience for staff if customers  are spread out;  but 1) you are in a customer service business, and 2) servers are not really needed to take orders with the table side kiosk.   I took my money next door and will Never return again.  Suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Two weeks ago, on a Sunday....We went out for a late lunch with my husband and two kids. This was our first time at this location. We had more than we expected.....We received our meals. As we started eating our meals, My husband started to gag because there was a band aid in his meal. The manager apologized and gave us our meal that day for free. REALLY DO YOU THINK WE WANT TO EAT AFTER WE FOUND A BAND AID IN MY HUSBANDS MEAL."}
{"text":"I placed Order on the Chilis to Go app at 4:41pm on a Wednesday. The app stated the order would be ready at 5:07pm. I arrived at 5:12 and they had not even put my order together. They were not busy. Why even have an app or online ordering if the business is not paying attention to it."}
{"text":"Today was the fifth visit in a row that we have had to send food back. Each time, management comes out and blames the server. New food usually takes 20-30 minutes to come back out, so everyone else has eaten. We had a server drop a knife on our son and swear in front of him. We've had cold food, raw food, burnt food, etc. We kept going back because it used to be so well run and the food was great. Not anymore. Don't waste your time. There are too many other great restaurants around."}
{"text":"This is a long review, by far my longest, but I feel this must be done.     I  have been a frequent of chili's for the past 25 years. When I graduated from bootcamp (USMC), my dad asked me where I wanted to go. Could have been anywhere, and I mean anywhere, but I said Chilis because I wanted the original chicken crispers, And I have gotten the chicken crispers every time almost since the beginning. They are the best in the crisper business, especially when u pair them with chili's awesome ranch and honey mustard.   I have been coming less and less though over the past year. While service stays on par, the quality of food is going down. The crispers have gotten to the size of a MC Donald's chicken nugget and the wife and I both agree the chicken always seems chewy. Not like how it used to be. My orders of kid crispers 25 years ago had more food on the plate then my order yesterday. And it's not just this experience. It is almost every experience. I could keep going on how disappointed I am with what this location has done to my love for chilies original chicken crispers but I feel my point is made.... My wife normally gets the pasta dish on the 2/20 menu and does not order it anymore because something about it changes or they cook it wrong every time.   I will give them a high five for not messing up the side salad yet but I am not keeping my hopes up. Also the panko fried onion rings (i think it is what they were called) were pretty good and I would order them again if I return before they take them off.   So the service is decent. The bartender/ cocktail server/ hostess does her best. But whenever we are there she seems to be the only one who actually cares about customer service. She can take a while to get to you but she seems to do more then anyone there. So kudos to her. I can't remember her name but she is always in the bar it seems after 4 PM when we go.   I will also give them another high five because this location keeps it pretty clean. From the outside to the doors to the bathrooms to the floors. It's clean.   This location is right down the street from me but I will start going to different locations to see if the chicken crisper problem is this store or chain wide. I am ready to give up on this location but not my crispers."}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions and the service is always decent if not more than that. They try to accommodate you as quickly as they can, although waiting for the food is a drag sometimes even when it seems pretty slow. All in all it's a quick and cheap alternative. The food and customer service make up for it hence the 4 star rating!"}
{"text":"So, went here for lunch and got the chipotle chicken mex bowl, which was ok. You have a choice of side salad (fresco or house), I got house (iceberg lettuce) and my husband chose the \"fresco\" which I specifically asked the girl what was in it- it was new as she explained and she pointed out it's pic on the menu insert. As she explained and the pic clearly illustrated; it was sort of a \"spring leaf\" mix with a vinaigrette. My husband recvd a bowl of iceberg lettuce with couple of sprigs of \"spring leaf mix\" on top and it was DRENCHED in vinaigrette- take a look at the bottom of his bowl (pic is posted here). As well, the plastic drink mugs were disgusting - scratched and gross on the bottom underside. You can do better Chilis, I've seen it."}
{"text":"My sister and I just came here to have lunch and waited 10 minutes without being acknowledged or seated, it wasn't until then a waitress made eye contact with us then walked away like we didn't even exist so we walked out to find somewhere else to eat. They were not even busy."}
{"text":"I love Chili's, they have a good business model, good selection of food, happy hour is great, fair prices. I've tried to like this particular location but the service at this restaurant is really lacking. Might be a managerial issue or just employees lacking motivation in general. I understand these are cost cutting times for corporations (always trying to do more with less) and they've tried to mitigate the situation using the order tablets at the tables for better service. Would have been much better if this was an independently owned restaurant instead of a corporate brand."}
{"text":"I was having an awful day. It was rainy and my moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis was acting up again. It usually happens when I play video games, and I was playing call of duty all weekend with my buddy chester from Pennsylvania. After a couple rounds of hardcore search and destroy games, we worked up quite the appetite especially when chester had a double snipe for the game winning kill on our last game. It was awesome, he's the best.   Anyways, we decided that we wanted to go to chills to celebrate. It was also almost chester's birthday so I said come on chester Ill buy the apps and he said ok that cool with me and so we decided to go to chills. So then I walked in, and I was mind blown. I was in shock. This had to be one of the most gorgeous places to eat I have ever been. We walked in the door and they treated us like royalty, they even told chester they liked his nickelback t-shirt which was pretty sweet. Then, they let us go to the bar and they didn't even check our ID's. Chester loved that, since he's turning 31 this week it made him feel young again. Then we sat down and the bartender, Zack, said \"gettin' away from the wives today?\" and we all laughed because it was just a cool guy moment and we just got to be a couple guys at the bar having fun.   After that, I ordered the chicken quesadillas and they were nothing short of phenomenal. I was so happy. Chester looked at me and said \"hey these are so good\" and then I said \"haha i know\" and we both agreed. I had a water, but it was great. It was cold and refreshing. Chester leaned in to me and said, hey, i can't wait to play some call of duty after we get done eating. and I said, yeah I know, and then we kissed on the lips.   I think that this is my favorite restaurant because of that moment. so many great memories, I can't wait to come back here. I love it."}
{"text":"Excellent service & great food.  Even more importantly, their service and quality are consistently good, visit after visit. Kudos to the managers!  We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"One of my go to stops when I just can't figure out what I want, it's trendy so expect it to be a little more expensive than it should be. The most recent time I went the soda machine was broken but hey, stuff happens. I almost always have excellent service when I visit here."}
{"text":"Exactly 4 French fries with the carry out order...are you kidding me. Just say you're out."}
{"text":"The service and food was great. Even though it was really busy (went on Valentines Day), the hostess and waitress were great. I felt that they genuinely cared about the service they provided."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a few people. Even though the place was mostly empty, we had to wait for a booth. When we were seated, it took around 12 minutes for anyone to see us. I know this because I checked in on FourSquare and got a free salsa and chips deal, so I had to keep my phone open to show my server, and I couldn't help but notice the time.  When when we could find our servers, which was hard to do, they were polite and helpful even when fixing an ordering problem.   The food was OK, nothing special. I did find the idea of corn in the guacamole a little unusual. I had the burger bites which were tasty enough to take home. My companions had ribs and mozzarella sticks.  Main complaints? Hard to find the servers, and the floor in the place was DISGUSTING. Napkins and sticky stuff everywhere. Nice things? Free deal on foursquare for salsa and chips, tasty burger sliders."}
{"text":"Terrible Chili corporate policies, they do not offer customer internet for the kids, they also have a happy hour for drinks and food but only if you sit in bar area. This as a parent means this is a non family oriented restaurant, my son has Autism with sensory issues to loud places (like the bar area) and if I sit 3 ft from the bar area in regular seating I have to pay more for the same food or drinks than the people sitting in the bar area, personally kids shouldn't sit in the bar area because there is a lot of adult conversation and cuss words that get used. Bottom line I will not be visiting another Chili establishment, there are to many family restaurants that have equal quality of food and are more children friendly.   CSM (R) Ronny R Martinez   Side note service, and food where good. I talked to the Manager about the policies and he listened, was nice, and respectful. However I waited 18 min for an order of tacos. In the end it was my choice to come here and I'll just make a better choice next time of where I spend my hard earned money..."}
{"text":"Happily, we were SAT right away. It's a Sunday night but we only had to wait less than 5 minutes to get a table inside. This chilis is located on top of another restaurant, so you have to go around the building and up the stairs to actually enter this chili's.   I've been to many of these restaurants. However, this is not one of the better ones. We both ordered fajitas and the quality was not the best. The portions were okay, but the portions of the sides were really small. Overall, the flavor just wasn't there either. But, recommend the cheddar cheese bites as appetizers and the endless chips and salsa.  I don't know that I would come back to this chilis if I was in the area. There are so many other options, you really need to be on the top of your game to compete at this location on the strip."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend had an amazing time here! There was this super nice host that greeted us and she reminded me of Ariana Grande. We had recently gotten back from a bad experience at rainforest cafe and decided we could never go wrong with chilis! And we were correct! Our server was really kind and outgoing I believe her name was Jessica! I'll be coming back, whenever me and my wife take a stroll on the strip again!"}
{"text":"I would like to start out by saying this was a potential miserable visit turned around. I went in for lunch right around noon and was placed at a table in the back corner of the dining area. After that it took about twenty minutes for somebody to even notice we were there. I was well aware it was understaffed, but I only had one hour for lunch. Finally a waiter named Jason asked us if anyone had seen us. He was clearly upset that we had been missed. From there our experience was without a doubt the best experience I have ever had at Chilli's. He was on top of everything and truly went the extra mile. The food was phenomenal (lunch enchiladas \"sour cream chicken\" and the margarita pizza salad. I am glad that we stayed, and I am ecstatic that we had such a good server. So cheers to you Jason, we will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Either the host didn't tell our waiter(tress) we were there or they just didn't come. People were being neglected left and right. There were the lucky few who were being helped. Regardless, they ignored us for 20 minuets! Not even drinks were given and no one seemed to notice. Management needs to step it up!"}
{"text":"I throughly enjoyed my evening out with my husband thanks to this location. We sat in the bar area and had friendly fast service. Food was excellent as well as the always delicious Presidente margaritas. And I must say I love the new look that Chili's is going for, it is very nice, inviting, and comfortable. Im a very happy customer."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and all i can say is bad service. It took a while for anyone to actually come over and get our drink orders and then once our waiter did get ours it took forever for anyone to come and get our food order. The waiter who got our drinks was different from who took our food order and neither one gave us their name. My friends order was overcook and when we asked for a new one the waiter didn't ask what she got so he brought out a different meal and then we were charged for both meals. Both waiters were going to other tables more frequently than ours and so we had to wait longer to get anything.   Luckily the manager was there and we talked to her and ended up not having to pay for the one meal thats the only reason why i gave 4 stairs."}
{"text":"The management here is exceptional! I ordered food on Postmates and they gave me the wrong order, but didn't realize it till 30 minutes after. I called and spoke to Chili's manager, Orville. He was receptive and reactive to my concerns. He reached out to Postmates and fixed the problem immediately.   He went above and beyond which I extremely appreciated because I'm also a manager in the service industry. Makes me want to offer him a job!   Chili's being a chain restaurant which I usually don't frequent chains, should appreciate him! Kudos to him being super great and he may get stolen from a chain!"}
{"text":"It's Chili's you know what you are signing up for. I've never had a problem with service here and the food is always adequate, I enjoy the potato soup.  Turn up."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the vibe is welcoming however the past three times we have visited our orders and bills have has issues. Not sure if it's our luck or what... I would understand if we had difficult orders but we are very simple people."}
{"text":"I am not sure you really want my review. We went to a Chili's about a year after my husband had his stroke. He has left side weakness. It was very hard for him to go out in public again. He was hungry for a steak, and I knew he was worried about how he would eat it, as he could not use his left hand to help him cut it. I was cutting his meals, but he would get upset because then mine would get cold. I asked the server if they could cut the steak, and we were told no, he did not think so. Did not even offer to go back and check. We left and went to Texas Roadhouse, they did not blink an eye when we asked them to cut my husband steak. My husband felt \"normal\" again. Shame on you Chili's for your poor customer service. We have not been back, and when people ask us at our Stroke support groups about our expreances we tell them how bad Chili's was but how AWESOME Texas Roadhouse is. It makes me sad because I LOVE Chilis. But I have to think of my husband and his feelings. He was very embarressed that night, and I don't know if I will ever get him to go back."}
{"text":"Had a $6 lunch special today.  Potato soup and BLT with fries.  Friends had the fajitas.  We like the place and give it 3 1/2 stars.  Very friendly staff, nice."}
{"text":"I used to find Chilis a really good place to eat but over the years I just don't like it as much.  I am not sure if my taste in food has changed or they have changed their menu.    I went there for dinner tonight.  I got the Chicken Crispers.  I do still like that.  It is greasy and fried but I like it with the honey-mustard as an occasional treat.  The waitress I had there was nice.  She was prompt in taking my order and keeping my tea filled.    As far as a dining experience goes I could not ask for much better service.  I just wish the other things on their menu were better."}
{"text":"So I call this Chilis location to place an order before leaving work because I know it's going to take 20 mins. One of the female workers answers and places me on hold, by this time I'm leaving work and driving to this restaurant. Surely they will pick up before I make it there, afterall its now been 3 mins. that I'm on hold. Five minutes later I pull up to the restaurant and I'm still on hold. I walk in with my phone still counting down and ask for a manager. I show the manager on duty (Z Morris) my phone and tell him that I called to place an order 8 minutes ago and was placed on hold. He gives me a rushed unsympathetic apology and looks at his phone, realizes it's true then hangs up his line (keep in mind there's hardly anyone in the restaurant). He proceeds to ask me what I would like to order. I place my order with him. At no point does he give me a discount or a free appetizer or anything for my inconvenience. Instead he tells me that he will rush my order, 20 minutes later I'm still sitting here waiting. Needless to say, I will never spend my money with this location again. Good customer service doesn't seem to exist here, beware!"}
{"text":"Came in and the place is dead, 20 minute wait. A family came in 10 minutes after us and they sat down and ordered their meal. Took additional 10 minutes to seat us. They weren't on the wait list, they just decided to seat down and the staff didn't do anything. No tip to the server as he's their server too. Taking 30 minutes to cook appetizer. Still waiting on food. Taking 30 minutes on that and we ordered simple."}
{"text":"I had very bad experience in this Chili . I ordered prime rib fajitas and the flavor of the meat was horrible, looked and tasted like sausage . I asked the manager what kind of meat do they used and he only answered \"a kind of meat\". what kind of answer is that coming from a manager ??? Very poor service at that place and the manager is so rude"}
{"text":"Understaffed, poor quality food, small portions, we didn't stay for desert.   Took the family out to what used to be one of our favorite places, Chili's. It's been probably a year since we last visited. We were asked to sit in a crowded booth-table but refused and instead took one of the many open full booths right breezy to it. Our waiter was slow to come to the table and offer us drinks. Hungry, I ordered the full fajita trio with beef, chicken and shrimp. Our food came out about 15 minutes after our order. To my complete and utter disgust, the trio featured about 2 oz of beef (maybe a two inch square sliced thin) about 1/4 of the meat on a normal chicken breast, and several small shrimp. Of course it was covered with onions and green peppers to give the impression of s full plate. This looked nothing like the menu.   Our waiter kept us waiting, especially when we were ready to pay so we could get out of there. I don't know if there is a new owner or what, but we crossed Chili's off our rotation."}
{"text":"I come here once in awhile when I want something different.  The food is okay and the service is decent.  I have been here before when the service is real slow. You just never know.  I go to this place when I want something close."}
{"text":"Please quit using the \"see bartender\" sign for to go orders. She is not attentive what so ever. I have to wait at the bar for 10-15 minutes til she shows up then another 15 for her to finally bring my food. And it's not because my food isn't ready. Because I ordered over 30 minutes ago and it would \"be ready in 15\". This has happened multiple times."}
{"text":"They make you pay extra for ordering food from the computer but they tell you that's what you have to do, it's also really dirty on the inside, the food is also not that good and the service is really bad and your not even sure if your spoce to use them"}
{"text":"Not a chilis person but stopped in the other night with the family after some shopping WOW service SUCKED food was cold and looked old. Skip it is all I'd say."}
{"text":"Amanda was our waitress and she was fabulous.  We had a party of 7, the beverages were out quickly and the food quick to follow.  Waitress was friendly and fun.  Dining area was clean and restrooms clean.  Would definitely be return when in town for lunch."}
{"text":"We stop here every couple of weeks and while the food is normally quite good, the staff  leaves something to be desired.  Today we got a glass with an inch long tortilla strip in it, no napkins (we got them ourselves rather than continue to let our food get cold.  One person ordered mashed potatoes and got fried, based on the receipt the server put it in as fries not mashed.  We got the pleasure of hearing the wait staff argue over who has how many tables (they each had 6 except for the person who just came on who had 1).  After delivering our food we never saw our server again, no drink refills or anything, until we were ready to leave when we were offered drinks to go.  Definitely not our best experience."}
{"text":"Slow service at lunchtime, the lettuce was brown, and the soup was ok, but not worth what they charge.  This was my last meal here."}
{"text":"This was a slightly above average experience for the chain. A friend and I went to catch up during the mid afternoon and were very pleased with the service. There was a new promotion going on with tablets on each table that allowed you to play games. We thought it was rather funny and pointless but perhaps if you had children to entertain you'd be willing to pay the $2 for access.  The sweet tea was not sweet; be prepared. Otherwise we both enjoyed our meals. My friend has food allergies and can't often eat spicy foods, but she was glad to find tex mex options that she was able to enjoy. I had the chicken pasta and was pleased, though next time I will try something else since there's a nice variety on the menu.  Staff was friendly and efficient, restrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Oh hell no! Got a gift card as a gift, ok cool. Thought, hmmm haven't been there in a long time this will be fun.  No. This is the McDonalds of sit down dining. I don't eat at McDonalds. So your thinking well, duh. But seriously it is a salty, greasy, nasty mess. I am out. You can get fresh, healthy, and so tasty food else where for same price. That's my take, to each their own (Pita Jungle.... Just sayin') Happy Dining and best regards!"}
{"text":"I no longer go to this Chile's because it is so hit and miss, especially on the weekends. My biggest complaint pertains to the staff, they are nice but there always seems to be an issue with getting it right.  The food is typical of what you get at the chain restaurants but given there are so many to choose from nearby I put this one near the bottom of the list."}
{"text":"Irregardless of the Chilis we go to the food is delicious, hot, & the staff are always very pleasant! Guac. Is def. fresh! I really don't know why Applebee's is still in business with Chilis in business! Btw the guac. Burger & sweet potato fries is the business!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this Chilis, but it has gone way downhill.  Dirty tables, poor service, food takes a really long time.  We had a server who was working her first night.  I do not blame her, just the management for putting her on the floor with no help or assistance.  Usually waiters shadow a more experienced waiter for a few days.  We even told the manager that she needed help. The manager just kind of disappeared after that.  She was overwhelmed, kept dropping food and clearly needed help.  I don't think that I will bother to go back."}
{"text":"I had an outstanding experience there with family visiting. Our server (actually, every member of the staff we encountered) was outstanding, helpful, and enjoyed what they do. The food was also phenomenal."}
{"text":"Hands down best customer service I've had in a long time! Shani is amazing and such a hard worker, definitely needs to be recognized! Her personality is outstanding! I've had her twice as my server and the second time I never had to ask for anything she remembered exactly what my boyfriend and I had the first time we saw her. Amazing server and amazing person! Thank you Shani for your hard work and just for being yourself!"}
{"text":"Figured I couldn't go wrong with Chili's.  WRONG!  Very limited menu.  Hamburger was nasty!  Will avoid Chili's Too locations in the future."}
{"text":"Went for lunch...very slow waited 15 mins just for chips and slasa....food took about 30 Minutes before getting to the table...manager walked by at least 4 times never a word. Another waiter tried to help1:30 on a Sunday only about 45% occupied no reason for such service"}
{"text":"We'd say this is our favorite restaurant nearby. The food is always fresh & amazing, especially the fresh salsa & guacamole. Service is great for both dine-in & take-out. Their menus have pretty much everything for everyone in the family. Our kids & relatives usually pick Chili's to have their birthday dinner. The Chili's app is great too."}
{"text":"This place is a complete let down. The service is poor and very unprofessional. The wait is ridiculous. I tried to give the place a second chance and that went to hell. Don't eat at this location."}
{"text":"OMG the words restaurant ever. Horrible food, dirty, horrible service.I concur what the other reviews have said.Hopefully the board of health monitors this site.The help is rude and hygiene is an issue .Servers are on their cellphones and eating food from the food line where the food is ready to go out to the patrons.The waitress never gave us the receipt to do a survey- wonder why? I find  it amazing that this Chili's is still open under present management.STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Chilies and the variety it offers. However, I do not think I will going back anytime soon. This last Saturday night, I went to Chilies with my Mother. We both ordered the same Entree, which was a Chinese chicken salad I believe. We didn't take 2 bites when my Mother noticed a Live Moth moving inside the salad, trying to free itself. I about spit out my food when I see for myself. The first thing we did was call for the Manager. What did he do?? His priority was to remove the plate from us to the kitchen before any other Customers knew what was happening. He said, can I get you another salad?? Of course we said No, our appetites were at Zero at this point. The Manager failed to offer any other resolution. We decided to just Leave. It's very unfortunate. Please look over your Food before Eating at this Location."}
{"text":"As a person with severe food allergies, I've always felt comfortable eating at Chillis because they are more than willing to accommodate me and take my concerns seriously. This Chillis, refused to make any accommodations or serve me food because I was too much of a health risk. It's hard enough traveling and having to worry about finding places to eat and Chillis has always been a safe place, until now. I am very disappointed in the staff at this particular place and the manager didn't even have the decency to speak to me themselves."}
{"text":"I have gone to other locations many times and almost always have a good time. However at this location my order is ALWAYS WRONG and not just the 1st time they bring it out but multiple times. They have never discounted my bill or offered any compensation for my over an hour wait while they rectify my salad and yet I still end up leaving most times with having eaten nothing because they can not get my order correct with in 2 hours of my initial order. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!!  Food always good and it's not to busy. Great chicken sandwich and buffalo wings are great too!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday around 3, every thing was fine. Myself, my husband and 4 year old daughter were sat at a both right behind the host stand. The service was great and the food was great at first.   My husband ordered the new chicken strip meal with blue cheese and buffalo sauce. It was cooked well and was crisp. Except it gave him food poisoning, BEWARE OF THE CHICKEN STRIPES. Most of the night and still as I write this he is in the bathroom sick as can be.  I'm just greatfull our daughter did not try any of his food. This a really disappoint because we go to chili's about once a month as a treat for our daughter. But now it's not worth the risk of getting sick."}
{"text":"Ordered from Courtney. Very professional. Was very happy with the customer service she portrayed.   I called the wrong Chili's. They took care of me and told me it was no problem.   Thanks Courtney."}
{"text":"Service was awsome...chrissy did her job...but the chef tonight suck...the food was horrible...i will never go back."}
{"text":"Visited this location last night and wasn't all too pleased. My boyfriend and I chose the appetizer southwestern egg rolls, which were satisfactory!! Fresh and Hot! The waitress was nice. The problem started when we waited 20 mins for our food and it was NOT fresh and hot. We both had shrimp apart of our entrée and they were COLD so we complained. We demanded the waitress go and get us fresh shrimp, at least. So she had us pick through our food and gather all the shrimp so she could take it back to the kitchen, I was confused. Promising hot shrimp she disappeared to the back, taking another 15mins. That's when we demanded the manager. I give 3 stars because once the manager was aware of our complaints , he immediately took care of it. He agreed to give us fresh entrées but the wait was still about 20 mins because other tables had complaints as well. Any who, we took our fresh food to go while the manager expressed his apologies and told us he hoped to see us back again. Which was pretty nice..."}
{"text":"Food is always good here! I've had nothing, but a great experience at this location. Allie (unsure of her actual name spelling) is an awesome waitress! She is attentive and prompt. Will definitely recommend this location to anyone!"}
{"text":"SLOW service even though the place was dead (no longer wondering why!) Waited 7 minutes to be seated and although the food is good the service leaves ALOT to be desired!"}
{"text":"We love going here for the chips and salsa. but usually they are short staffed and the food takes forever to come out. Normally one of our orders are incorrect. We don't go here as much as we used to."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years, but I just Hate the arrogant ASSHOLE bartender at this one and will never go there again. he is a a JERK..oh yeah GO PATS !!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever... Sat ourselves in the bar, got drinks and then sat there for 15 mins waiting to be helped and none came. People sitting down after us were being severed but waitress and bartender just keep looking past. Finally got up and left and told the hostess that we waited 15 mins and got no help and all she says is sorry and turns around to help other people. First and last time goig there.Never going back again!!!"}
{"text":"Recently Remodeled, looks nice and fresh usually sit in the bar, food is pretty good but not great. Wide selection on the menu Service in the bar is always good"}
{"text":"They are a single franchise and therefore not connected to any of the normal Chili reward programs.  I however didn't find that out until after I had ordered."}
{"text":"Waited over a half hour to be seated.  Watched couple after couple walk in after us & be seated instantly.  When I questioned the hostess about it, I was told that she felt that we needed a table.  Mind you that this was only two people for dinner, & she felt that we needed a table?  Did not request a table, & both our butts fit just fine in a booth!  Talk about discrimination, felt like I was on the What Would You Do Show!  Never experienced anything like this in my life!  Manager could care less & did nothing about it!  Walked out, & will never be back!"}
{"text":"It was my very first time going to Chili's and it might just be my last time too. There are far more restaurants with better quality than this. However, it may be one of the better options at the food court inside of the Concord Mills Outlet Mall.   All the food was either just average, or below average. The tortilla soup was way over salted. The chili was just tasteless. The burgers and sandwiches were OK. I felt like it would be easy to make that. I got the sliders and they tasted like, well sliders. Nothing about the sliders wowed me. I thought the fries were good though. I'm glad the lunch special came with a soup or salad and some fries because I definitely have had better for the price it was.  I guess being average isn't so bad. However Chili's average food wasn't the thing I was looking for."}
{"text":"Chilis is a chain restaurant. I hate to say my experience wasn't the best because they have an amazing happy hour and 2 for $20  Service was mediocre. Friendly but took awhile for food. Fajitas weren't anything special. The man of a family in front of us was complaining to the manager. I'm not a person to complain so I paid my bill. Waitress didn't come back with our change. We had to ask her and then she blamed someone else for not bringing it."}
{"text":"So we've been in KY for the last 9 months & forgot what Real salsa tasted like! Try their cheese sauce with the chips -yum! Got their last booth on a sun afternoon and great fast service!"}
{"text":"Service was great... The food was not!  Old iced tea; the ranch dressing for the chicken, bacon, ranch quesadilla must be out at the ranch... Dry dry dry maybe I will try them in a year or so"}
{"text":"we quit going to chilis about a year ago because the food was so-so..we thought we would give it another try.well,nothing has changed. We started with guacamole dip as an appetizer, it was quite tasty however the chips and salsa were so salty you could not eat them..i had the Cajun chicken pasta,yuk! the pasta was so over cooked it was like \"pasta pudding\"..my wife ordered the 6oz sirloin..after 3 tries they never did get it cooked med-rare..our server was very good and tried very hard, only so much he can do. Needless to say we wont go back again.."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Chili's. ..but not this one! ! Waited 45 minutes on a Thursday night for our meal. When I got my grilled shrimp salad the shrimp was not only cold it was not done! When I told the server the shrimp was cold he said it was because the salad was cold. .. REALLY? !?! Had to ask for refill. . Never bussed the dirty dishes of the table. . Worst service I have ever experienced! !"}
{"text":"Love this Chilis!! Service is always great and so is the food. My husband and I come here once a week... There is a location closer to us but we prefer this one!!"}
{"text":"I ordered fajitas shrimp and chicken they were terrible they do not cook them on a grill or even in the fajita pan anymore. The chicken the vegetables onions and peppers and shrimp were boiled. No flavor after two bites I sent the whole thing back. We will not go back to Chili's ever again"}
{"text":"Favorite chilis love natalie but most horrible service last week with manager that didn't do a great job either. Should have walked out when I found out natalie or jen was not there but decided to stay steak was dry (cooked medium) server never came back to check on us just because we are regulars doesn't mean we do not deserve the same service as any other customer.  We flagged manager down to let him know about steak and all he had to say was did you order dessert. .no!!! Would you like dessert uh no would have liked my steak redone but never offered I ended up just leaving. But to make things worse I asked for their District managers number and they didn't want to give it to me. I had it at home I called him and I've yet to get a response back on the issue, I wrote an email to the email that they gave me still nothing back from anyone I also went o  website to submit a comment for someone to contact me and a week later nothing. Everyone just be ware of service and management at this location if you so go in ask for natalie she will make sure your shit is right. So funny I am an assistant manager of a restaurant and it's crazy on how they run their business."}
{"text":"I visited on 6/14/15. Shawn was my server. He was very nice, attentive&professional. The bartender who was on duty was nice as well. The restaurant was very neat&clean. I let Shawn know that it was a shame that I had to travel from unpleasant servers& a dirty restaurant(Inglewood) to Vegas to get proper treatment. I will return to this location. Good service all around."}
{"text":"Three adults and two children for an early dinner.  I ordered soup and salad, other adults ordered Mexican dishes, children ordered Mac and cheese. Salad came out immediately, rest of the food took about 1/2 hour. Mac and cheese was clearly Kraft.  Baked potato soup soup was ok, but would have been better if I would have had a clean spoon that I didn't have to wash myself. Other adults dinners were left under headlamp so long that sources were baked on to plate and cheese inside was disintegrated.  Complained to waiter who said he didn't understand because nothing sits under lamps, it is all on a conveyor belt?  Manager came over and briskly asked \"what's going on?\"  Nothing was going on, and the diners didn't even want replacements or reductions from bill, we're just being honest when asked how everything was.   Anyway, they did take one off (it wasn't eaten). Server was ok, and received a 20% tip on what the original bill would have been. Last time for chili's for me."}
{"text":"The chicken avocado burger is delicious! It's on a pretzel bun which goes great with spicy mustard. The presidente margaritas never disappoint and if you are here at 3 it's happy hour!"}
{"text":"Hostess is terrible at her job. She spent more time sitting at a near by table instead of helping the customers as they walked in. She clearly has no desire to do her job. When she would finally get up and walk over to the front desk she told everyone that walked in the wait would be 25 minutes ,as soon as they would walk way she would say. ..or 40 minutes  Lots if open tables in the restaurant but no one being sat."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend.   The service was decent but the food was not great at all.  Artichoke and chips - dip was good but the chips were a joke . Paper thin and always kept breaking .  Boneless chicken wings - pretty ok..   Not coming back"}
{"text":"Chili's has so many fond memories that are reflected in Stars #4 and #5.  It all started many years ago with the chili's near my high school, and continued through there.  While on a business trip, I had to stop there for dinner because my mignon had never experienced Chili's.  As his boss, I felt obligated to expand his mind, just a little.  Their Endless chips and salsa are my favorite meal - i could literally eat just that for dinner. The Oldtimer burger is amazing and their fries are some of the best ever.  Their healthier options are pretty good too, while on the road, I can always count on the salmon and broccoli to be delicious.  The margarita grilled chicken and tortilla soup are other favorites, as well as the chicken caesar salad.  And how can you go wrong with potato skins??  Anyways, I would be remiss if don't mention how great the service was at this particular Chili's.  JJ was awesome, friendly and attentive.  I don't think my chips or soda ran dry at any point during the meal.  Thanks JJ!"}
{"text":"I felt is expensive. Food is not so great. Place is not decent as expected. I dont prefer to go again."}
{"text":"Return visit to this Chilis was back to normal. Ate at the bar. Great food, margarita and bartender."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. Our server was also the bartender and she could not manage the bar and our table. She only checked in on us once and we had to wait for refill chips and drinks and over 20 minutes for our bill.  The manager was very short with our table and did nothing to manage the slow, poor service. There was a second server who could have helped our table as well but only stopped when we were ready to leave to take away empty plates. Our order was also incorrect and the food was only average. We will never return to this Chili's."}
{"text":"Visited for first and last time recently.  Service was poor.  Received a beeper and went to bar to wait for our table.  Having already heard one customer complain that his beeper didn't go off, my husband went back to hostess stand to let them know that our party was waiting at the bar.  Twenty-five more minutes and he went back to see how much longer for a table and was told that they paged us about 15 prior.  Beeper could not have worked because I was too hungry and was staring at it the whole while.  Finally seated and given menus. Another five minutes and we meet our waiter.  Ordered appetizers and entrees.  At least fifteen to twenty minutes before the appetizer arrived with no checking in by our waiter.  Appetizer was the onion strings and jalepeno stack.   The food at the top of this pile was pretty tasty.  The onion strings were obviously, however, taken out of the deep fryer and immediately plopped on the plate without draining as anything under the very top was just a pile of greasy goo.  Husband had fried shrimp and fries and it was about the standard frozen food dropped in a deep fryer fare.  I had the Margarita Grilled Chicken and I really can't describe how oddly yucky it was.  It was  on a bed of white rice with black beans, which was bland but not bad for what it was.  The chicken, however, had the strangest taste and texture.  It was like you had ordered a ham dinner and received Spam instead.  I think that's the last of Chili's for us.  For the same money the food at Applebee's is so much better."}
{"text":"This is a hit or miss. The new menu is awesome but the staff are a little lazy. I've had decent servers too. Food is always consistent."}
{"text":"So me and my boyfriend frequent this place because its pretty convenient to where we live and not too expensive. Everything I've ordered here has been pretty damn good. But as for him it has been hit or miss. Granted you can't expect a grand slam when you order ribs from Chili's, he wasn't a big fan, and they honestly didn't look all that great. However when I've ordered everything was pretty good. The mushroom and swiss burger is by far the best thing I've had here. Cooked SERIOUSLY to perfection, juicy and the perfect amount of pink! Oh and everyone has got to love the chips, they're pretty much a staple! So ya, don't expect a miracle from the meat side of things besides the burgers."}
{"text":"On the night we ate they ended up seating us in an area that seemed to double as an employee lounge. They had waitresses counting out tips, setting silverware, being loud having personal conversations etc.. If it was just a minute or two I wouldn't have said anything, but since it was getting later in the evening it just wound up getting worse.  I would have given a two star except the food and drinks were pretty good and the manager gave us a free desert and moved us to the bar when brought to his attention.  The only reason I will be going back is because the manager handled the situation perfectly."}
{"text":"Fun Atmosphere, Excellent Friendly Service, Delish Menu Items, Love the new device on the tables that gives you a sneak peak at beverages and deserts and lets you register for the rewards program right at your table.....It seems like Chilli's did a complete make over. I had been to a Chilli's years ago and was not impressed, it was greasy bar food and super generic. WOW, seems like someone took over, revamped the menu and more.....WE LOVED OUR WAITER AND THE FOOD ITEMS WE ORDERED.  ONLY NEGATIVES: IT WAS FREEZING IN THERE, THE AC WAS CRANKED UP WAY TO COLD FOR NIGHT TIME AND THE CHIPS THAT WERE SERVED WITH THE SALSA, WERE WAY TOOOO SALTY. HOWEVER, THE REST OF OUR EXPERIENCE WAS EXCELLENT AND WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK. You Made New Customers/Lovers of Chilli's. The Quacamole Turkey Burger was superb, cooked to perfection and the White Queso Spinach Dip...Super!!!!! Thank you very much!"}
{"text":"Waitstaff was great. All else was par.   I should have known that Chili's (in general) is \"upscal-ish\" Tex-Mex food. My daughter ordered from the kid's menu. She got the gross KRAFT mac-n-cheese. She couldn't even finish it. I ordered an expensive bar item (meh) but for food opted for the chicken soup. It was OK but I was given a plastic spoon b/c they were \"out\" of silverware. I am not a snob, but I am not paying for ANYTHING to be given plastic \"silverware.\" Really?! NOT the sever's fault (I worked in many restaurants so I get it). I darned sure didn't appreciate that. But beware of the kids menu. I tasted my daughter's mac-n-cheese and it was NASTY. Had a great server but something was terribly off that night. I saw other tables leaving (at first now knowing what was up) but they must have had an off night. BTW...no more of this chain for us. If we want Mexican, we know where to go. Applebees in so much more appealing to families. Sorry, Chilis, but I really tried to give every benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"We eat at the Chili's on Lake Pleasant and Happy Valley often.  Whether we eat in or do Take Out, the food is always great and you can't beat the value.  Our favorites are the Chicken Ceasar, Margarita Chicken, Boneless buffalo wings, and Fajita's.....Make sure you try the flavored iced teas-Mango is the best!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at this location one time. I ordered a hamburger and it came raw. The outside was cooked and the inside was literally raw. I hate sending food back and very rarely will. Big mistake, I tried to take a second bite and almost threw up. I sent it back. The manager did come out to personally apologize. The second burger came cooked but at that point I felt sick and no longer had an appetite. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"We ordered our food on line. We were told our food would be ready at 5:13 pm. Arrived on time, but it took 9 minutes for someone to come out, wait on us and bring my cold order out from the back shelf. Sorry guys, no gratuity from us today. Ps,  our chicken crisper were not done."}
{"text":"This is my second time here in 3 months with my girlfriend. The service was pretty awesome this time but the food was totally crap. They burnt the crap out of my hamburger and when I told the server she said that they thought it was before they brought it out. I asked why did they bring it out? She said the cook and mgr said to do so. Well I had her take it back and I said no to getting another one. The manager did come out and take it off my bill but was very non chalant about it. Just left a bad taste. The server was awesome now.   On another note they have like little iPads that you can order desserts and alcohol with or at least refills of your drinks. You can also play games and pay your bill on it. That is pretty cool"}
{"text":"I love this chilis! We come in all the time, the queso is the best thing I've ever had, no lie!!! The waiters are really friendly, I just only have 4 stars because the mangers seemed rude and demeaning."}
{"text":"Well I didn't get to eat my dinner. Lost my appetite after finding a hair in my food. Broccoli was ice cold...won't be back"}
{"text":"Chili's responded with an email that doesn't exist stay away from Chili's !!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This Chili's is horrible. Went at about 9pm, had to wait half an hour for a table, despite it being half empty. Dirty dishes stacked up on empty tables. Thinking about calling the Health Dept., the place was dirty, trash all over the floor. Our waitress was awesome, but severely over booked. Won't be going back to this one."}
{"text":"I love Chili's but this location just takes all the stars. Every time I come in here to either sit in or take out is always great. Staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I'm here every Saturday night love the service love the food only once I was upset with service but they fixed it since the greeting girl that works in front was gone hopefully extra training since she would let you walk In and not say a thing to you or even look at you so you would be standing there intell you talk to her. Other then this one time service is great. Servers ask you how is food and manager even comes around to greet you. Awesome Service. I will come here often."}
{"text":"I'll be back for sure! I went to this location the day after an unpleasant experience at the nearby Applebees. All I wanted was a good margarita and some good wings. The other place had let me down, but Chili's came through! Their buffalo wings are excellent- meaty and well seasoned and crispy. When I'm in the mood for wings, I know where to go! The blue cheese actually has chunks of blue cheese in it as well, instead of just being a watery mix of blue cheese flavored cream. The celery was crisp and not browned on the ends like some places.  I had 2 margaritas and they were perfect- so good! Just the right amount of sweet and sour, just smooth enough on the liquor. Not too much salt on the rim and she did not forget to give limes with it or straws, plus the shakers and glasses at Chili's are just better. 2 drinks and I felt a proper buzz.  I also had an order of guac and chips to help tampen down my buzz after the margaritas- I am not a fan of the thin style of tortilla chips Chili's has but I don't hold it against them. The tableside guac is much better but the kind I had today was just probably some pre-made guac mix scooped into a ramekin. Wasn't bad but I'd probably skip it next time or if I really want guac, spend the extra few bucks for the fresh stuff."}
{"text":"Wow this food is terrible. Came here with the family and everyrhing we ordered was terrible. The steak fajita was undercooked, my daughter's fries were old and stale and when i was looking at the salads on the menu it didnt say that it came with onions and when it came it had onions in it and im allergeic. Terrible place"}
{"text":"This is the best Chili's I've been to.  Some Chili's you have to wait for your food.  Not here.  The Chicken Enchilada Soup is to die for.  The staff is friendly, kind, and prompt.  The GM is doing something right here.  I'm there once a week.  I love it here."}
{"text":"Took 37 min to get food during an almost empty restaurant...server was not attentive....asked for items for the meal and never came back. Staff very poor quality."}
{"text":"Horrible! Came in there for lunch, me and wife ordered: I got fajitas and she got half a turkey sandwich  My fajitas Come to the table and no half a sandwich for her....time goes by no food, bartender then ask how the food is, I reply she didn't get hers,he goes huh, then instead of checking on it goes to take other orders and chat with customers   I finish my food and still nothing for her,he finally goes to check comes back and says \"they need to make it from scratch\" a half a turkey sandwich needs to be re made,how'd someone mess it up, then finally after long wait he brings it out after they've cleared my plates.   Had to get it to go after that due to Almost an hour for half a turkey sandwich. Amazing"}
{"text":"I don't get it, when you have a special department for take out you would think they could get it right.  Our whole order was a complete mess! Waste of money!!"}
{"text":"My family's go to place for dinner out. Affordable and tasty! This location doesn't have long wait times."}
{"text":"My family and I went here to celebrate my sons circumcision/ college graduation. He was extremely excited to go to chilis!!! So excited that he happened to rip his stiches! :(.  We did invite the Rabi who performed the circumcision earlier that evening, in the hopes that we would find a kosher meal suitable for his palliate and beliefs. Needless to say that we could not find a kosher meal for the Rabi nor could we find a meal that could brighten the spirits of my freshly cut son. The waiter had dropped soo much grease from the sizzling fajita onto my sons lap that his genitals now look like Bee Arthurs neck.                                                                                                       Shalom,                                                                                                       The Rosenburg family                             P.S. We should of went to Applebees!!"}
{"text":"We arrived early for lunch but still had to wait a good half hour before our lunch for two arrived.  And it was horrible.  My food look like it had been thrown on the plate. Slopped up the side and dried on the plate.   I ordered a toco and an enchilada.  Both were well below average especially in this city.  The other plate was a sandwich with avocado - it had one tiny sliver of avocado  This place has really hit the dumps.  Never again."}
{"text":"There was a decent wait , but spots were open at the bar so we walked right in.  The appetizers were good and the service was quick and attentive.  The meals were average, hence the lower review.  Lots of screens for watching sports though, so that was a nice surprise.  I would come back again when in the area."}
{"text":"The food was good, the waitress was a little slow but overall we had a nice experience. The chicken nachos are slowly becoming my favorite..."}
{"text":"The food is just okay. Nothing to die over or to make a fuss about. I return here because its so close to my house. The service is usually really nice. Ive only had one expirence with a less than friendly waiter. Smokehouse burger I think its called and the fried shrimp are some of the better things on the menu."}
{"text":"We come here often and usually have a good experience. Today was not the case. We were disappointed. It wasn't busy at all. We got there at 12. We only ordered 2 soups a burrito, kids Mack and cheese and a molten cake.  The service was slow. And food took forever to come out. I think with your system the servers don't check back enough. They did refill our waters. But we had to go ask for a to go box from the hostess. They didn't even pre bus any of our plates. We did tell the hostess and another gentleman that our service was slow today and all they said that they were sorry. I am not sure if the waiters told us their names . Should of had a better service recovery plan. Thanks."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. I travel for work and go to Chili's often but this one is sad. I should have left when I saw a 90 rating from the health dept. They were not even 1/2 full. The food took a long time to come out. I had fajitas and the steak was dry, my wife's French fries where ice cold. I am taking this one off my list."}
{"text":"Today my husband & I went especially to try the loaded fajitas. He had the grilled steak & carnitas; I had the grilled steak & grilled chicken. The fajitas come with white queso & all the fixings you can imagine. They were fabulous! They were the best fajitas I've ever had & I've had fajitas all over the country. Our server was outstanding. There was no wait. The food came very promptly. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"We had time to kill so we decided to eat at Chili's Too. I think it was a great choose. The food did take awhile to arrive but we weren't in a hurry. The server was attentive enough. We had our drinks within 3 minutes of being seated. My Cobb salad was exactly what I needed, but it was $4 more than our place in Houston and they forgot my red bell peppers! Honestly it's a airport restaurant, it is what it is. But I do wish the Vegas airport had more choose, I mean it is Vegas!"}
{"text":"Chilis is a bar and grill restaurant. It offers a dining area for you to sit in and at a table. It also gives you a bar so you can just sit at and enjoy drinks that have been made by the bartender. It offers a variety of food. From entrees like burgers, steak, and fish, and if you are not feeling to hungry then they have appetizers like hot wings, sliders, chips and salsa and so many more options. Also they allow you to order your food from home and pick it up and take it home. I personally like that there is so many options to choose from on the menu. I like how they also cater to the needs of someone trying to be healthy and watch their diet by adding healthy items to the menu. The staff is great and helpful. They don't hang around, and watch you eat. They check in at appropriate times to refill your drinks and ask how you're doing. The only thing I dislike is the waiting time. I usually have to wait 30 minutes to be seated. But that is because I usually go on the weekends, so it is understandable. I would give this restaurant 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Rebecca was a competent server. Ancho salmon a bit over cooked. But delicious nonetheless. My friends tacos were \"very good\". Bartender clueless how to make an Old Fashion, which I believe, is one of the oldest cocktails known to man. Just appearance it was obvious that 3 of the ingredients were missing? Don't they teach these people? There's more to bar service than pouring beer.  And probably more profitable.  Initially ordered a Mojito, was told they don't have mint. My thoughts, bartender has zero motivation or desire to be a competent bartender."}
{"text":"I went to this location because it was open later than the other locations. Our waitress was inattentive we ran out of drinks even though she had a partner to help her. We has one person seat us, another person get out drink order, a server and a server partner, and the person who brought us our food. I am really not even sure who I tipped but very inconsistent. It really wasn't that busy and it tool about 30 minutes to get out food, good thing we ordered an appetizer. We has to ask for silverware after being seated for over 40 minutes, we got it after out food came. I had the Cajun chicken pasta on the 2 for $30 menu it was very salty, I had about 3 bites of it and couldn't stand it anymore. Fajitas were good Southwest Eggrolls were good Cheese fries were good Kids were happy with the Old Timer Burger. The staff was not on the same page with the menu substitutions, which was kind of annoying. Maybe it was just an off night but I was not impressed"}
{"text":"Drinks where amazing. Long Island ice tea was so amazing. Thought the bartender keith didn't put any alcohol in it it tasted so good. It was a very packed bar. But I'll never forget my server savannah she was amazing. Great smile and I just loved watching her walk away.  She was really friendly telling us about her brand new baby. By the looks of her you wouldn't have guessed she just had a baby. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food is just okay. My stepmother asked our waiter what was the best thing on the menu was. She gave him a few options and asked which he thought was best. He was saying, \"No, that's not very good.\" and other responses like that. It was horrible! He was really confusing us, so we decided to just order what we thought would maybe be good. Anyways, my point is that the service is very... weird and I just never know what to expect."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's the trend for EVERY Chili's to be horrible, but this one is pretty high up on the list. It was such a slow Tuesday night, after the dinner time rush. There were 2 tables, 1 just finished and 1 was eating. It was just the 2 of us for dinner and we had such an un-attentive server.. she brought us water and then our app.. took the order that was it. Drink didn't get refilled, (by anyone) we didn't even see her until AFTER we decided to leave because the order came out wrong. She was serving an 8 top that walked in and got so pre occupied that we were forgotten about... her excuse was \"sorry for getting tied up.. \"which I would understand but we didn't get any refills, our empty app just sat on the table for 20 minutes, and we waited for food that shouldn't have taken as long as it did with hardly anyone in there! Not to mention the order being wrong. She offered to get a manager, but honestly I don't want a manger to make an excuse and have things re made. It was a simple order. I get big parties mean possibly a bigger tip, but I can guarantee you we tip 20%+ so don't judge a table by its size and leave the smaller ones for larger ones... you're only hurting yourself.  I will not be going back to Chili's ever again.   Ps: We did pay her cash for the app we received, so this is not a review for free food. I will not be emailing you to have you \"make it right\".."}
{"text":"We were seated at once. But unfortunately after that our experience was doomed for disaster. It took longer than expected to get our drinks. In fact, we received our appetizer before our drink order. Our waiter was named Jamie. And he was horrible. In fact. If it wasn't for my friend and I looking around, we would have been stuck the entire night with him, but to our rescue Ashley and Samantha saved our night and immediately saved our service. But even with good service. The kitchen staff was awful too. Sending back food and having over cooked meals. The only reason I'll be back is because of Ashley and Samantha."}
{"text":"Prices have increased.  I also got a hair in my food and it took forever to get.  Quality of the food has also become more mediocre, and menu offerings aren't very impressive anymore.  Used to be one of my favorite places to eat; now, it's overpriced and disappointing."}
{"text":"I came in and was greeted inmediately, sat down, and asked for my drink order. Very patient and friendly staff! Food was great too! Thanks Chili's!"}
{"text":"It's a little off the beaten path. I thought it would be a little closer to the Mall. Just like any other Chilis, the food was good.  My husband tried the new Prime Rib Smothered Burrito. He would order it again.  ** They are not apart of the Chili's Rewards program until AUGUST  20,2015"}
{"text":"Unnecessarily long waits, mediocre food, staff that couldn't get an order right if we wrote it down for them.  Place is filthy as well."}
{"text":"Sat down at the bar side of the  restaurant server was really friendly. Ordered a apple orchard in a cold mug chipotle chicken crispers never seem like they come with enough sauce. Good place for lunch."}
{"text":"Keeps getting worse and worse I thought I'd give it one more chance over 40 minutes waiting for food since we ordered and still nothing no check in or anything - from now on will be looking for a different chilis location for the future"}
{"text":"For the record, Chili's is not the type of place I go to, but the choices once past security in the airport are limited.  Chili's gets several things right in this aviation context:  + The bar extends out into the main corridor, so you can here announcements + The food is quick to prepare, so you don't have to worry about timing + The bill is brought immediately + The staff at this location were very attentive  The food is more of a mixed bag:  + Awesome shrimp quesadilla.  I wanted to hate it, since it's a chain: but the tortilla was freshly made, paper thin, crisp, the shrimp tender, the real cheese gooey, and the pico de gallo flavourful. + The drinks were strong and tasty - The chili cheese nachos are more like Cheeseburger Hamburger Helper than nachos.  I think a good plan is to avoid all menu items involving processed cheese or ground beef."}
{"text":"Had dinner st Chillies tonight. Chili was ok, nothing great. Try Lupies if you want great Chili. Salad was also just so so. Nothing special. Service was less than good. She messed up the order. Blue Moon on tap was cold and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this restaurant negative stars! Worst customer service EVER! No one asked for our order for about 20 min until the manager came up to us asking if we have been served yet. We replied no, and that we have been waiting for a while. He had nothing to say, not even a apology! He took our drink orders and brought it back,then we waited another 20 min for a waitress to serve us.(btw this was on a Monday afternoon) Finally a waitress approached us. Not even introducing herself. All she asked was \"did you get served yet?\" , \"What do you want?!\" Very rude!!  Will not be eating here again! Very disappointed! Stay away!"}
{"text":"I always liked Chili's.  So my friends and I thought we would check this one out.   When we walked in, the bar looked pretty cool, so we just sat down.    It was nice and chill, and there were lots of TVs.  And it it was on a Sunday, and it looked liked they had the NFL cause most of the games were on.   The food was good here too. Got the Top Shelf Enchiladas.  It came with rice and blacks beans, which were surprisingly good.    But I think the best part about this place was that prices weren't too bad, compared to the typical strip prices.  All the meals were reasonably priced. And It was only $5 for a large beer.  They have a happy hour special on Sundays too.  I think it's in a great location too.  It's right across from the Aria.  It has a nice patio seating area that looks like it has a pretty good view of the strip.  All in all, it was pretty good experience, and I would recommend it to people and families that want to get a great and not \"break the bank\" meal."}
{"text":"This was a huge mistake coming to this place. Horrible service. Can't tell you how the food was, didn't wait around to find out. Definitely never going back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! I just got out from there ans I was not given my food  after like 20 minutes. I had order a salad... How can someone take so long to make a salad? Plus y was given my ticket and took other 15 minutes just to ring me... Shift manager was never checking on guest. There was people before that were waiting for their food... I felt bad eating my food... They were way too busy closing the register... When they should of be taking care of guest ... I'm never going there ever again ..."}
{"text":"Great staff! We had Dannielle and Erica they were amazing!!!!! Thanks girls for being friendly! Food was great as well!"}
{"text":"I personally hate chain restaurants but my boyfriend wanted to go to this Chili's since we hadn't been for awhile. Once we walked in the door I remembered why. We waited for someone to come seat us for at least 5 minutes. A manager walking out of the door had to yell that there were people up front. After being seated we ordered the 2 for $20. I got the chicken fajitas while the boyfriend got the margarita chicken and we decided to share the corn guacamole. The guacamole was nothing but avacados and jalapeños and was pretty much inedible. My fajitas consisted of burnt chicken, three strips of bell pepper and an entire onion that was burnt. The margarita chicken was bland and the black beans looked old. The kicker was the wait staff. Not once was I asked if there was anything wrong with my food and we never got refills. When I complained about the food the waitress apologized and walked away. Will never go to another Chili's ever."}
{"text":"I never leave this place unsatisfied! Always right on the money with service, taste and quality. Love the chips and salsa, loaded potato soup and the fajitas! Great happy hour prices as well. The food is consistant at every location I visit. Love the dinner and drinks for 2 as well! Our server Alex was super friendly and made us feel welcomed and comfortable throughout our stay."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday around 3pm. At first it was slow, but when we were ready to box up and check out the bartender (our server too) was busy at the bar. Manager 1 was watching a football game on t.v. while his bartender was busy. Manager 1 sees and talks to manager 2 (must have been about the football game) manager 2 walks right in front of a t.v. and watches the football game. After manager 1 makes eye contact with me as my guest and I tried to flag them down. We get manager 2s attention and get boxes and change. For the food... it's what you expect from a chili's Applebees tgifridays type of place. Ordered ribeye medium rare(as any good steak should be cooked) to be served an uneven cooked ribeye. Some parts super rare. Some parts medium well. But again I have come to expect this level of cheffery from these types of restaurants. At least my beer was poured well."}
{"text":"The food took, or shall I say is taking, as it has been 45 minutes as of now that I've been waiting for my food, much too long. I will say that their drink service is top notch. I haven't found my glass empty yet. So that's a plus.   Update: still here. Paying is also not a priority it would seem. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went on 4-23-16 for dinner. Got a table and waited too long to order drinks.  When we finally ordered food, it took too long for that too. The actual food wait wasn't bad, as a different waiter brought us our food. My girlfriend still didn't get her drink and we told that waiter and still nothing. Our original waiter finally came and asked if everything was okay and I had to tell him that we didn't have silverware and was still waiting for a drink.   When the waiter brought our food it was the wrong thing and requested the original platter we requested.  They fixed the bill, however, I the total experience was horrible.  I've been there before and it wasn't this bad.  The new waiter was polite (hence the 2 stars) but he was new and had no idea what he was doing it seemed.  And it wasn't even that busy, hope they got their stuff together"}
{"text":"very bad food old not fresh Chicken Fajitas were terrible. The Margarita chicken burrito bad too. very bad place. price too high service quality bad."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. The host does not know how to do her job. She said 15 minutes and I was waiting for 35. When I asked her once again how long it would take she said she really didn't know because of a health inspection. She could've said that earlier so I wouldn't have wasted my time for nothing. Very ridiculous and horrible communication."}
{"text":"Went there today and the waitress was beyond rude. Another waitress came over and gave us chips and salsa. Our group thought chips and salsa came with the meal, so we started eating them. Our waitress then asked who was going to pay for the chips they gave to us.... We refused to pay that was not our mistake.  The waitress then asked us 3 different times how we are going to pay for 8 of us. We asked every time to please separate the bills. She not only rolled her eyes, but she said \"okay then...\" in a rude tone. I would not go back to this particular location.   We also had to asked 3 times for waters and the drinks that we ordered. Finally the manager came over to help.  The only thing that evened out the trip was the fact the food was actually good...."}
{"text":"The food was good the service sucked !! Bathrooms were disgusting silver wear was dirty"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason this place exist is because they have beer and a monopoly! My fajitas were luke warm nuked! Go to the wine bar at the end of the terminal. Did someone give this place 4 stars? Wow what planet did they eat on?"}
{"text":"service sucks today! our server is too lazy to check on us but when he brought the bill is different.. took us 10mins before we ask for a drink/order.. need to wave for refill of our drink.. they are not busy at all.."}
{"text":"if i had the option not to leave a  star i would!!!! i came here for my birthday i had a huge party the first server we had was rude second server seems like he didn't want to take our order we were on separate checks so i get it but u still have to do ur job plus we our a group that tips base on customer service which we didn't have! our server was told multiple times it was my birthday and i didnt get a song or the little desert which i really didnt care for but since he was told i figured he would have got it together. everyone was unhappy at fact that he wasnt attentive, we had to flag him down, not to mention the bathrooms were disgusting the whole dinner was a joke. my mother asked about the birthday celeb as we were leaving and he said well i asked the kids what was her name whaaaaaat.... there were 7 other adults you could have asked what about asking the person that advised u we had a birthday in the first place. my salmon was dry the broccoli was raw not steamed like i asked... it was issue after issues don't go to this location the best chilis i've been to so far is on las vegas and warmsprings or charleston and ft apache. they deserve my 60%-100% tip everytime!"}
{"text":"Went to this Chili's with a group of people and the waitress that waited on us acted like we were an inconvenience. Gave her our card right away at the end so we wouldn't have to wait longer to leave and she forgot to run it the next time she came back to \"check\" on our table. Finally went to run the check and it took her another 10 minutes to bring back the card. Probably was taking a smoking break to \"punish\" us for being a larger group. We were the only table she had!"}
{"text":"We had the smoked wings tossed in wing sauce...really excellent. Our waiter Gandy was exceptional! The enchiladas we quite good, in all a very nice experience."}
{"text":"Are you waiting for your flight out of the Las Vegas airport looking for some decent food quick? You are in the WRONG place my friend...  Yesterday my husband and I were exiled to the far distant D gates at McCarron International Airport where we had FORTY minutes until our Delta flight departed. As often happens while air traveling, our meal timing was way off and we were very hungry. We are accustomed to slog through the modern day date rape that is the TSA screening, then relax, have a drink and some food prior to boarding.   I mean come on...everyone knows that airports nowadays have great dining at super fast speeds to accommodate their customer base - you know...people in a HURRY about to get on PLANES?!?  Well the joke was ON US when we arrived at our gate. Only fast food outlets awaited us and we HATE fast food so we took a deep breath and made our way to the only actual restaurant in that area which was Chili's Too. We could see 3 empty tables, all of them covered with dirty dishes. One very unhurried hostess asked if we wanted a table. Uh...yeah why else are we here? I have never in my life seen a table cleaned off more slowly. We were then seated and provided with a limited menu but some decent looking selections, everything from salads to burgers. Then it happened...  A woman, I assume a waitress, hurriedly passes us by and with a nice smile says the following \"Forty minutes for food.\"  Then she took off like a shot, leaving NO time to ask her what on earth that meant. My husband and I looked at each other awkwardly and he said \"It can't possibly be 40 minutes for food. This place is in an airport and its not even that busy\" A couple of minutes later our waitress comes by (we flag her down)   Here's how it went down: Husband: \"Is there a wait on food orders\" Waitress: \"Yes 40 minutes\" Husband: \"40 minutes from the time of seating or ordering?\" Waitress: \"It will take at least 40 minutes after you order sir\" Husband: shocked speechless look \"uh....ok...\"  We then quickly left and went on to have a disastrous experience at Quiznos, but that's another review (sigh)  Rant: Ok so what part of AIRPORT restaurant does Chili's NOT UNDERSTAND?? Who are your customers? PEOPLE waiting for FLIGHTS who DON'T have that much TIME!! 40 minute waits are not uncommon it appears from reading other scathing yelper reviews here - seriously what the $&%*???  Avoid this place at all costs! If you are unfortunate enough to have to fly out of the D gates of terminal 1 - BRING A SNACK or plan to GO HUNGRY if you want any decent food!"}
{"text":"Worst  chili's  I have  ever been  to . bartender  with  a gotee is a total  douche  bag,and tried to  hit on me while  I'm clearly  straight? Wtf"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Chose the bar as it was uncrowded drinks were served pronto. Ordered wings and salad both of which were well portioned. Will definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"This review is based on my visit yesterday.  I've been going to Chilis restaurants in 4 states, since 1989.  Never had a major problem. I loved their nachos. Most of their food  is pretty good. Until yesterday.  I ordered the Queso dip.....The  Queso dip is cheese dip with beef. According to the chilis menu.  I received a skillet of beans and brown stuff. It had little to zero cheese in it. The bartender who served us asked if everything was ok. I said. I'm still looking for the cheese.  His answer..  \"That's the mix\". And walked away.   Ok. I've had this before. It was a nice gooey cheese with beef in it.  Not this dog food. Actually I wouldn't give it to my dog.     I ate about five dips of it because I was starving. Trying to figure out how to deal with it.      Either Chilis standards for quality are in the toilet ( where they got this queso dip) , or they don't know how to make it at this location.  Read your menu Chilis , there was no cheese in this dish.    So many other places in our area that serve quality food. I'm wondering if my husband and I will ever make it back.  The attitude of the server sort of sealed the deal. If they don't care about us being happy about what they put out. Why should I go back for more."}
{"text":"Too much salt!  If I were a wild deer, I might have appreciated the salt lick that was my meal.  And I like salt.  I even liked the Angelina Jolie movie.  I sent the fried onion and jalapeno appetizer back and replaced it with fried cheesesticks (no appetizer option that was not fried), but it was both salty and freezer burned.  I then got my meal and had three bites before I gave up and sent it away.  They gave me coupons for a next visit, so I gave them to other diners.  I will not risk the high blood pressure.  Service was good, but they need to make the food on site so that they can adjust the salt content.  I think corporate wants to sell more drinks."}
{"text":"I was in town for a business trip this past week. A couple co-workers and I decided to head here for dinner. The food took over 45 minutes to come out, and wasn't what I would consider \"hot\" when I finally got it. Taste was average at best. Only bright spot was our server, Ashley, she was awesome!"}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with team mates. I had the shrimp tacos and they were yummy.  Our server was very friendly and we love the chips and salsa!! We always do!!! ;)"}
{"text":"We were in town from California and this Chilis was near our hotel. It was late and we wanted to grab a drink. The Bartender was super friendly, she had several customers but she made us feel as if we were the only ones.  If I remember right, her name was Bree. We will definitely return next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Service was good at times,  but we tended to get forgotten about at times.  The fixings for the fajitas were very skimpy.   The look and feel of the restaurant is very clean and modern.  Overall it's okay."}
{"text":"I asked the hostess whether this restaurant had something vegan and gluten-free that I could eat. She muttered \"no\" and walked away without ever making eye contact.  Maybe she was not even right! But she was so surprisingly rude that I went elsewhere for food."}
{"text":"I. Chili burgers be the bomb when ever I'm around a chili it always make me want to get a burger , the service at this location is cool. I never had to wait long are really complain about anything. It gets a little busy during lunch but not to bad , it's also near the outlets."}
{"text":"It was ok.  It is really busy on a  Saturday even at 2pm.  They messed up my order and my margarita came as my main course arrived.  The chips and dip was great the last time I was here, but not this time."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way home to grab dinner for the family and it was actually quite busy in here. The girl placed my order and I grabbed a drink while I waited. My takeout was ready in 15 minutes .  Enough time for me to enjoy my drink after a long day of work ."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner there last night. He ordered chicken nachos and I ordered salmon. It took almost an hour to get our food. Last time I checked, it didn't take that long for nachos and salmon. More than half way through our wait, they brought us chips and salsa. At no point, did the manager come out and offer an apology or drinks or anything while we waited. This was some piss poor customer service. It was our first and last time. We'll stick to Cactus Moon."}
{"text":"Went here last week and the service was great and the food was good.  We didn't have a long wait either which was good because my sons were hungry.   This location has better service than the one by Chandler mall."}
{"text":"So disappointed to find out that Chili's has yet again removed another favorite item off their menu. No more Cesar Salad and now, no more potato skins. Even more reason not to return! Thumbs down to the  menu planner."}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch and i had a grilled chicken platter with broccoli and it was amazing! They even had tablets to keep us occupied. They were quick and the servers were very nice and friendly. I love coming here for lunch and dinner. I look forward to going there again."}
{"text":"For a huge restaurant chain, Chili's has gone down hill. My biggest complaint was the food. The restaurant was basically empty, including our table (of only 2 people), there were only 3 tables occupied all of which only had 2 people. Our food took quite a while and the server apologized for the wait which would not have been a problem if it had been busy and the kitchen swamped, but it wasn't. There was a lot of the staff members doing nothing because the place was so empty and they had nothing to do at 7 pm on a weekday. Anyways, I had ordered the Avocado Bacon Chicken Sandwich which came cold, including the fries. I ate it anyways but it was not very flavorful. My boyfriend ordered salmon which he said was not that good, it was just \"ok\". I am not a seafood fan so I didn't personally try it.  To make it ironic, my boyfriend's mashed potatoes came out blazing hot, but were bland. After notifying the waitress, she did nothing to amend the issues. However, she did apologize and was extremely polite. I could tell she had little serving experience; not her fault.  I would like to note the fact that the decor was pretty cool and it had a nice atmosphere.  Also, my boyfriend and I are FAR from critical people when it comes to our food. We enjoy pretty much everywhere and I hardly find myself disliking food. We enjoy everything from fast food to fine dining and rarely ever have anything to complain about. I would give more stars for the decor and the super nice hostess who had a huge smile on her face when we walked in!! Give her a raise!"}
{"text":"Server Laura gave prompt, friendly service. Food came out timely and was hot and tasty. Only complaint was that lettuce in salad had a few brown spots. Everything else was fresh.  Many more vegetarian options than they used to have"}
{"text":"Disappointing service. We walked in at 7:15 pm on 8/13/16. Ordered our food about 10 minutes later and we walked out at 8:10pm hungry. Our food still had not shown up. We had to hunt down a server to refill our waters. Very poor service. Looking at the other reviews now, it seems that is the norm."}
{"text":"Our server was great. Place was very busy do to a fund raiser. unfortunately the kitchen could not keep up. My daughter got an extra bonus, though, a hair in her taco. yummy!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of Chili's in general, and I could probably count the times I've been on one hand. But it's where my sister wanted to go for her birthday, so off we went, and I've got to say that it was my best Chili's experience to date, and a pleasant surprise.  We got chips and salsa and some panko breaded onion rings as apps, and they were pretty standard. My brother-in-law described the rings as larger versions of what you get at Burger King, and he's pretty much spot on with that assessment. The ranch they served with them wasn't very flavorful and it was kinda thin/watery. Pass on those. The chips were fried fresh, and apparently bottomless. The salsa wasn't great, but the chips were crispy and light, so I ate waaayyyy too many of them. Chips are addictive.  Carnitas, though. That's what made this trip worthwhile for me. They weren't as good as any decent Mexican spot's, but they were miles and miles better than they had any right to be coming out of the kitchen at a Chili's. Tender, juicy, and a little fatty in the best possible way. You can get them as fajitas, or in tacos, and I went with the latter. Three huge tacos come with an order, along with sides of black beans and cilantro lime rice. I'm sure you could probably make substitutions there if you liked, but I kept it as is, as I was kinda feeling the Tex-Mex vibe. The black beans were very liquidy, more like a black bean soup. I'm guessing that's how they intended them to be though, because they served them in their own little cup on the plate. The rice didn't really pop on it's own, but when you dumped them in with the beans, they married together into something pretty good.  Our server was great, always on top of keeping our drinks full. A separate gentlemen brought out our food though, and he wasn't nearly as pleasant. He was clearly very hot, sweating profusely, and I think it was affecting his mood. No smile, and everything he said was very curt. I mean, I know everybody can't be bubbly all the time, but you're (supposed to be) a professional, right? If you need to take a break and grab a sip of water, do it, don't be all disgruntled. It reflects poorly on your establishment.  Everything but the carnitas were 'ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh', but they were good enough to be a saving grace. I don't know if I'd go back again just to get them, but if you ever find yourself at a Chili's, they're definitely worth having."}
{"text":"Ome of my all time fav spots!! For some reason this thing is not lettong me add pictures...but that wo t stop me. So to start we ordered the southwest egg rolls which were amazing with the guac ranch dip. For my entree I had the Trio fajiyas(chicken steak amd shrimp) since i couldnt decide which one.. the combo of veggirs and sauce was great. For dessert chocolate melted cake. NEED I SAY MORE! they also have these cool tablets on each table in which u can reorder drinks or food...you can also play games and pay your check!!"}
{"text":"I have never waited so long for food in my life, almost an hour and nothing. After I was sick of waiting I got my kids and left and on the way out they try to be like, oh here's your food it's coming out. I told them to forget it, they said we can box it up for you. I told them to shove it and left. I have never been back and will never go back there again ever!"}
{"text":"It's on par if not better than some of the nearby chains. Sometimes not sure of the identity they're going for.  Most things are American but the theme revolves around south west food. I like that they have non typical sides."}
{"text":"The restaurant kept us waiting for almost an hour without updating us. My party was 9 but if they couldn't handle a large party they should have said so but after an hour we left and got a table right away. I am sorry we went here."}
{"text":"Been here twice poor service and the food it's always old tasting. Probably the worst chili's ever."}
{"text":"This place has a great location with a second story deck overlooking the street. The food was fine for the price but the service was HORRIBLE. Bad attitude displayed by  waiter and host. Unfriendly and quite condescending."}
{"text":"As I am writing this review I have yet to see my food. We have been given complimentary chips & salsa. However, I have seen 2 other tables get their food before me. This is terrible service...please beware of this chili's as you will wait for food for it to be warm."}
{"text":"I went yesterday with my family and thought I was ordering a steak fajita , explained to the waitress I have an allergy to black pepper so she told the chef I couldn't have black  pepper in my food and I thought I was getting steak Fajita turned out I was brought out a steak. While I was eating the steak there was black Pepper on my steak the baked potato and the vegetable. I would not eat at this restaurant because they don't take food allergies seriously and I had a very bad reaction and I was sick all night. That chef should be fired and this no reflection on the waitress she explain to the chef about my food allergy but he didn't care."}
{"text":"I came for happy hour and the restaurant was filthy!  Even my server looked unprofessional and unsanitary.  Dirty plates with food from previous guests. However her attitude was the worst!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! Wait staff are just order takers. We never saw our server,  had to ask fur a side plate with our shared meal,  had to ask for ranch that we never got. Don't have time to interact with guests. Food is very quick but front of house definitely needs help. Will never come here again and won't recommend it! Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Have to say the service was great and the food was perfect! In and out quick! Love the nachos and my bbq burger was outstanding! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I usually don't complain to the restaurant servers, but this time I wanted to let it be known. I actually waited 1 day before doing this post.  I took my wife to lunch at the Chili's Grill & Bar Stapley restaurant location at 11 am to beat the lunch rush.  We were seated and placed our orders. I ordered a chicken burrito and my wife ordered the salad and soup special.  About 8 minutes later a couple was seated next to us and placed their order.  About 11: 38s they were served with 2 Steak Fajita's dinners. Well with my shocked I asked our waitress not to be rude, but how did the couple bedside us receive their order first. Her reply was it takes longer to make a burrito. Well wrong answer I thought to my self. Still waiting for our order I asked her where is our order. She said coming up. So about 5 minutes to noon which my lunch break is over, she finally brings our order. I told her to just bring me a Togo box and the bill. I hope Yelp lets them know about Chilies un timely dis-order. Thank you."}
{"text":"Food is always good but service is mediocre at best, its like a hit in miss with a good one and a bad one."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Chilis on a Sunday afternoon. My Strawberry Margarita was excellent. Will definitely get it again. We ordered the bottomless chips and salsa. Thankfully we did because it took over a half hour to receive our ribs. When we finally asked the waitress how much longer because we had plans, she said not much longer. After about 15 more minutes the manager came over and apologized and brought us our meal. He said our waitress \" forgot \" to put in the order. He didn't charge us thankfully. U won't say we won't go back, but we were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Very very bad service, if you like to go to a family restaurant please please do not go to this one. The server was so not happy with her job and did not like people. Why are you in serving industry?"}
{"text":"First time here and we choose to eat here bc it was close and we've never been here. First, the server was nice and friendly but needs classes in coursing and explaining the menu. Not to mention how to upsell. Then we ordered margaritas and the server didn't tell us they only blend the classic and not the other flavors. Once delivered, they are completely blah and tasteless. Been spoiled by true Mexican restaurants. My classic margarita I swear was only sweet and sour mix. It was ABSOLUTELY disgusting.  I ordered a shot of tequila to cut the mix. How can anyone screw up a Margarita! The food was blah and okay and the service was ok. The only decent thing was the skillet cookie. What you'd expect from these low class chains. I've bartended, served, and managed for over 16 yrs in fine dining and I should haven't expected much. But still, won't ever be returning. If you're in Phoenix,  eat at a Mexican place for Mexican cuisine and margaritas. I'd simply suggest to just don't come here and waste your money."}
{"text":"Chips were stale and chewy, the table was dirty when we came in, pizookies aka skillet cookies are kinda small"}
{"text":"Extremely mediocre food and poor customer service. Would rather go to a fast food joint, would not return again."}
{"text":"The food was adequate.  The service was atrocious!  We had a $40 \"2-go\" order to be picked up at 7pm.    Our order wasn't ready 7:10pm - ok, fine.  What's the rush, right?     None, and I mean NONE of the special requests were honored (no onions, extra rice (for which we paid)) AND instead of pork, I received shrimp for my fajitas.   I'm allergic to seafood!          Our previous experiences with this Chili's has been so-so at best.   This last experience was so far from reasonable that we've decided we're done.   There are so many wonderful choices in our neighborhood, and this Chili's is no longer worth our time or money.  It's really unfortunate.   The brand concept is a good one, and we've been to many Chili's that were awesome.  This one obviously suffers from apathetic management.     It's sad."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I are regulars at all chilis locations. However at this one,  we always happen to go at night.....bad idea. EVERY TIME we go to this location, the service is horrible. They take 10 mins to greet us after were sat, IF THAT. I remember one time we literally waited for our drinks for like 15mins. And everyone else working there is just walking around like no customer is being ignored, when more then 2 people saw us sitting there for more than 5 mins, without drinks. Idk if they just think were some kids that dont matter, so they think they dont have to try, but they have yet to find out that if they did, theyd be surprised with a big well deserved tip. Anyway, the food is always delish, compliments to the chef. But thats it."}
{"text":"The service at this location was awesome. Amanda H. was our waitress and she was fantastic. She was everything you want in a waitress friendly, quick, and attentive. The food was fresh and delicious. They also have a great kids menu. Thank you Amanda for a great experience today!"}
{"text":"Good quality food for a decent price in a casual atmosphere. I have not had any problems with service so I am surprised that the Yelp rating is low. I have the loyalty program which is okay and is about a 10% earned coupon."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was great!! The server was very friendly. We asked if they had gluten free beer because my husband has Celiacs and they did. It also happen to be his favorite kind. She was also kind enough to recommend their gluten free menu. Which is only a computer print out but it made ordering much faster. We were checked on several times and she even changed the tv when we asked. We were very satisfied with everything at dinner tonight. Did I mention we had 3 children with us that have very small patience levels? They were also happy and enjoyed their food!! Thank you Chili's for a wonderful evening of no cooking."}
{"text":"Same ol Chili's! Had to wait about twenty minutes tonight, I guess at least that means they will stay open another year, lol  Good atmosphere, the food was consistent with most Chili's experiences! The staff at this location are friendly and efficient! Overall a nice meal!"}
{"text":"Food is decent however service needs improvement. Last two visits the service was incredibly slow, not the place to go if you're tight on time. The fixings for the fajitas were skimpy. Overall average."}
{"text":"I haven't been to chilis in 5 years! I went because I had a coupon for a free kids meal with each Adult meal. The house margaritas were only $3.99 and were strong :) menu is large! The southwestern eggrolls were very good!"}
{"text":"Big puddle in the floor on the to go side waited 15 minutes for an order that was supposed to be ready ten minutes ago. Finally left after being ignored by staff. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been constantly pleased with each experience I've had at this Chili's. Wait times are never too long and service has always been good. I love the variety that the menu has... There's always something for everyone. They're starting to improve their beer list as well."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow. As the other reviews state, you are seated quickly and then wait. And wait. And wait. Someone from the management team should look at what is going on at this chilli's."}
{"text":"Went on Super Bowl night and was seated quickly. Our order was taken within a few minutes and our glasses were always kept filled. The food was delicious and the service was great. When I'm in Las Vegas I always stop by here because the service and food is always good."}
{"text":"The service here is always personal and the food comes out quickly. I have been dining at this location for almost a decade but the new look is amazing. I'll be at the all day Sunday Happy Hour in the lounge regularly for sure! ;)"}
{"text":"Our server Erica was very sweet she was so polite and had a smile the whole time! our meal was hot, fresh, and even looked better than the picture, that's hard to find! and im hard to please! I haven't been to Chilis in about 8 yrs I had a bad idea of the quality however I was surprised overall it was great! we will go back! note to others the table games for the kids do cost money, and were not aware."}
{"text":"Never again . Terrible customer service and the food was dry and cold . Had to ask for more water several of times and our table stayed a mess instead of the server coming around and cleaning it . The desert was the only good part ."}
{"text":"Just more the same really. Nothing special. The service was good, friendly and pleasant."}
{"text":"Had just recently started going back after some some bad experences. Hate to cook so between dining in and take out we were going about five nights a week.The service was ok but then when I did have a problem I found out what they were really like.After  uneatable take-out (the buns were pink with blood-not good for this always well done meat eater), and non of my toppings were correct I tried to call and complain.The manger didn't even seem apologetic and said he didn't know what he could do about it.Promised to check in to it and call me back, but after waiting two days I called back and was giving the run around.Only after telling him I was going to put a review on yelp did he decide to send me two $5.00 dollar gift cards (this didn't even come close to covering the cost of my order).I'm through paying for bad food, and then them acting like I want something from them (I do but only what I paid for).So, it looks like I'm still looking for a decent place to  eat because I still hate to cook."}
{"text":"We had a 2 hour stopover so we figured we would grab something to eat before trying our luck at the slot machines.  I am a HUGE Chili's fan and this place didn't disappoint.  We sat at the bar top and were immediately asked what we would like to drink.  Once our drinks arrived we ordered - Buffalo chicken sandwich (one of my faves) and chicken fajitas.  Both were great and didn't take long at all.  In fact, I hadn't even finished my margarita by the time our lunches came out.  The bartender was nice and attentive.  I was a little worried since I asked for no tomatoes, wheat bun and blue cheese instead of ranch and he didn't write anything down, but my sandwich came out exactly as I asked.  Compared to all the other airport food there is to choose from I would definitely come back the next time we are waiting at LAS."}
{"text":"Good service . They were able to give me a great meal on my lunch break with out have to take to much time. Clean place Will repeat.."}
{"text":"Hmm...sadly, not enough menu... :( ... Margarita would've been awesome, till I found a \"Fruit Fly\" in my drink...hmm... other than that, staff were great and great location..."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience. Fantastic server and if you go ask for server named Bruce. Great personality and amazing service. Have to see to believe...... And the margaritas are fantastic........"}
{"text":"Yes, this is a Chili's but if this is the corporate standard, I don't even need to think twice about going to another one.  The 2 for $20 menu offers no deal unless you want more deep fried food.  I had the ribs and they were dried bones with little flavor.  Server recommended the dry rub and then brought out the wrong ones.  (Actually the wrong ones looked better than the ones I ended up with.)  My companion ate his entire meal while I was waiting for my dinner to be rectified.  Overall a bad dining experience.  And if someone else is giving it 4*s because they let her bring the puppy into the restaurant, I'm really going to avoid this place."}
{"text":"ordered buffalo wings, baby back ribs and mango tilapia, and it tasted normal.   however, had quite a shocker of a service when i asked for my leftover food to be packed and taken away and found that they have thrown it away instead. to give him the benefit of doubt, the service staff interpreted wrongly and apologized. after which he mentioned that he can bring us the left over chips from the kitchen if we still intended to bring away food.   however, taking the left over food from the restaurant doesn't sound pleasing to our ears and we chose to walk away once we know of the incident.   Also, I am a tourist for 3 weeks in USA and this was a first time in which a service staff had mentioned verbally to us that we should give 20% tips. given that he didn't do any spectacular service, we found it to be a very absurb request."}
{"text":"This is the only place with screens showing games in D gate terminal. I asked to watch the final Sounders regular season game,  and was told \"we can only show football. \" On the 4 screens,  2 screens were showing the same game, and 1 was showing a car show. Based on bull sh*t selective application of the rule,  I will now be avoiding all Chili's, and encouraging my friends (many of whom also avidly follow MLS) to do the same."}
{"text":"I like Chili's! They have great food and excellent service! They had a grease puddle on the floor and I almost slipped! I LOVE the food, but the portions have gotten smaller."}
{"text":"Stopped in while in the area. Our server was efficient but gruff - so we were ok with it. It was happy hour, so why not, we ordered 2 cocktails each during the meal. Alas, no buzz whatsoever. I happened to be a chicken topped salad aficionado, it's my go to entree. Hands down, the worst chicken I've ever been served in any restaurant, including fast food drive throughs. That's all I'm going to say. Oh - wait - the boneless buffalo chicken wings - very good."}
{"text":"I love love love my french onion soup. I sent it back to be remade and the waitress made sure it came out with more broth and a timely manner. We were a table of five. They accommodated us since booths were unavailable. Would def come again. She was friendly with our children as well. Wait for food could have been better."}
{"text":"Love Jen! She is the best server!(: the food was great like always! Could be a little faster though but it was busy! Best location I've been too so far.(:"}
{"text":"Based off the other reviews I'm sure I'm not the only one who has had a bad experience. There is absolutely no reason for someone to wait over ten minutes to get their drinks ordered, then another ten to actually get them. A hostess should be more focused on seating people then cleaning off a table that is not needed at that point and time. I seriously saw her stare at the people walk in and they stood there and waited. She continued to clean off the table that no one sat at after. CUSTOMERS come first. Our server also waited on tables 3 times for instance checking on them and filling their drinks while we sat there. One rule anyone in this industry knows is to make sure every customer has a drink on their table first. This makes customers happy! Not sitting there being ignored and get some lame excuse that someone called out, I don't care you own the fact that you ignored us for 15 minutes! Food was average. Terrible timing with drinks from the bar. My food was delivered to another table they picked it up after putting it there and then gave it to me, that is not okay!"}
{"text":"Waited over about 85minutes for delivery Steak was tough and overcooked (beyond well done - asked for a medium) Overpriced and Expensive for what it was about $35-$40 including tip for 10oz steak, baked potato and blackbeans Black beans are better out of a tin Asked for refund heard no response"}
{"text":"Stopped for an early dinner with my wife,she wanted to try the two for twenty special. As soon as we told the server what we wanted the service went downhill. We did not order any alcohol and we were having the special so this was not going to be a big check for the server but restaruant was not busy so any check should be better than no check.  Used the kiosk to pay for meal since i couldn't get the server to come back to check on us.Discount did not show up on kiosk I shouls have been  more aware since i had heard a similar comment from another table when we came in. Server said not to worry that the amount was correct. I pushed for reciept showing what was actually being charged to ny card. server said she needed my card and would have to talk to the manager. Finally got my paper reciept with correct charges but kiosk on table showed the over charge and had not adjusted. My wife thought we were going to be billed twice for the same meal, so she has been watching the debit card account. This incident killed my night and the weekend with my wife constantly checking the bank account. This incident is all that my has been talking about to her friends all weekend long, I am sure that this will continue once she gets to work tomorrow."}
{"text":"Something about Chili's always brings me back. Maybe it is the delicious chicken crispers. Perhaps it is the molten lava cake. The 2 for $20 really isn't a bad deal, though oftentimes my wife and I will just share the chicken crispers (with double fries, no corn) and an appetizer. Plenty of food for two."}
{"text":"Questionable service, dirty floors, sticky tables - non existent management. Sub par food. Don't get a salad unless you want salad mix."}
{"text":"Im not a huge fan of majority of Chilis menu but what I always get is the honey chipotle chicken crispers, fries and a corn on the cob and I love it. It is my go to food when I am unsure of what I want to eat or where, everyone loves chicken fingers!"}
{"text":"They will take a hell lot of time taking orders and bring your orders. When I visited this place it took them 30 mins just to take my beer order. You can imagine how much time they took to bring my dinner. Beer quality is good."}
{"text":"Avoid this Chili's. My partner and I have been here on multiple occasions. We've been sat at different places, but service has been consistently mediocre. On one occasion we got sat and after 10 minutes I had to ask a passing server to take care of us because no one had even gotten our drinks. On another occasion, we had two servers, one of whom only appeared once, the other one needed to be called by other passing members of the staff at our request.  And if you're thinking about ordering to-go, don't. We got there on time, and we had to wait, only to get home to find that our food was cold and stale, they forgot to add the salsa for our chips and salsa, they got one of the soups wrong, and they forgot the gravy on the mashed potatoes side. That means that they only got ONE of the items right. Or they would've if it wasn't cold and it didn't look absolutely mediocre.  Seriously, their food is good on-site, but their service is absolutely horrible. Avoid if you want to have a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Years ago I was here and was not impressed to the point it took around 5 years to go back. Now we go quite often, I almost keep going back waiting to get bad food. We have been here about 5 times in the past 4 months. It has always been good, the servers have been nice, and the food is amazing. The price is the other thing if i take my family of 4 to outback the food is ok and i drop around 70 bucks. I haven't gone above 50 here and have always loved the dinners. My kids really like their pizza, apple cinnamon thing and corn on cob. I get the trio thing and change the items in it, always been very tasty!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I have not visited a Chili's in about 8 months because of the last review I wrote but today I had a couple last few hectic mintues at work and went to have my ring cleaned at the Jared's next to them. My fiance suggested that we should have margaritas to chill me out. I agreed.  We were pleasantly surprised to see a hostess waiting for us! She was very upbeat and wonderful!! She had pink hair and tatts, never knew her name, but she was AWESOME!! We sat in the bar and we noticed that the staff and menu had changed. Our server Wendy was FANTASTIC!! She was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable and just what this place needed to regain a potentially returning customer!! We were also impressed with the new items such as the 'El Nino' margarita and the fried cauliflower! SUPER BOMB!! :)  Overall, this place needed some changes and so far I see them as has been met. We will definitely be returning!! Very impressed! Def 5 stars!! You won us back!! :)"}
{"text":"The staff of college-age waitresses is what originally drew my attention to this location. Good thing too, since the food is excellent and prepared the way I asked."}
{"text":"We went back on Sunday, Nov, 29, 2015, we ordered our usual fajitas, steak and chicken,  no sauce or juice, meat was very chewy, and this time it came with a lime???  Hubby couldn't chew the meat, they were very stingy with the chicken.  Won't be coming back to this location for a long time.  Please bring back the MUSHROOM JACK FAJITA, it was juicy, and tasted great."}
{"text":"I always like Chili's food and bar service.  Pottstown has limited places to enjoy the game while drinking a $1 pint after 9PM...this place is wonderful!  They change the channels to your game and will turn up the volume if requested.  Bar staff was super awesome!  Really enjoy the this location."}
{"text":"Our first two experiences at this chili's was great. Every time since had been terrible. The two male servers were the good experiences. The female servers, the 4 we've had, all were very unprofessional, not friendly and felt inexperienced. I love chili's too. But this one isn't worth going to. I'll drive to the one further from my house just for better service."}
{"text":"Just called to order n pay ahead... No u can't do that. Ok can we place a Togo order n suddenly decide to sit there... Uhhh ok.  Hold on we'll take ur order... Can I change the tostada chips to corn chips for the queso skillet... No I don't think we can do that... Really??? How hard is it to change chips on a plate n add a dollar.. Well ya can't do what ya can't do she said... Wow!  Good bye... Goin t Applebee's."}
{"text":"I gave this place a shot because it's close to home and I had a $25 gift card but make the drive elsewhere. The servers took way too long to take our order and even longer to refill my water. The food was nice and cold. So if that's your style of dining, head that way."}
{"text":"The waiting for the wait staff was long. The service wasn't great. The food was lacking. The steaks were dry. Our drinks weren't refilled and we waited for a while. We had to flag down the waiter. Won't be returning. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Great place to get food poisoning. Went last night and my wife and I are both sick. Doctor said she sees a lot of patients that are sick after eating at this location and that the same thing happened to her own family. We will not be back."}
{"text":"We haven't been to this Chili's in a while due to issues with poor meal service but we gave it another try today after about a year. Well, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I don't know if it was understaffing or just not caring but either way it was unacceptable. No one seemed to be in a hurry, if they were understaffed. In the two times I went to the service area to refill my family's tea, I could see servers chatting in the back. No rush. Our server never refilled our drinks (walked by numerous times without noticing and my husband had his water refilled at the bar). I had to remind him two times for certain things, got my family's (and the table next to us) napkins since our server was MIA. Poor service. Food was good, so I did give a star for that. I didn't finish it all and after waiting around, got my own to go box. Never an apology or anything. Maybe the management should go next door and get the Chick-fil-A managers to do a little service training. We will not be back and I guarantee the same goes for the 3 other tables around us.  Management needs an overhaul and if they are short staffed, needs to light a fire under some servers or at least show some hustle."}
{"text":"The 2  stars is for the food. Place was not at all busy yet food and drinks took forever. Erin our server was terrible. She constantly forgot things we asked for."}
{"text":"Yummmy! Love how they add new items to menu often.  Food is always great. Service is fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Service was ok but the food portion was a disappointment. Ordered a steak fajita and it was only enough for 2 Tortilla from the 4 you get and the steak was chewy. First and last for me."}
{"text":"A few months ago my son and I went to this location and enjoyed a marvelous experience with great food, and a brilliantly wonderful waitress that I left a 50% tip.  Believe me, she was amazing!  This time we were so excited as it would be our second visit and let me tell you, I left the waitress a 0% tip.  This is something I never did before.  After we put our order in we noticed people coming in after us, getting their food, paying, and leaving.  I kept looking for our waitress while trying to keep my son entertained, but she forgot we were even there.  Then she came and told us that the kitchen was backed up.  Yes, she lied.  If she had been honest and said she forgot to place the order I would have understood as we all make mistakes.  She chose to lie, when we had eyes to see others eating.  Then we waited even longer.  Like, really long considering I got a very simple salad, and my son got the fajitas.  Nothing that should take so long.  Well, it was my son's first experience with fajitas, and I explained to him how they come out sizzling in the pan, and the smell is incredible.  Luckily, the table next to us, which came in 30 minutes after we placed our order had also ordered the fajitas and my son was able to experience that excitement vicariously.  It would still be 45 minutes before his showed up.  No sizzle, no smell, and a bit on the cooled off side.  My salad was soggy from sitting around so long, and drizzled in queso fresco, which I asked to be left off because I'm vegan.  Oh, and thanks for the burnt flatbread, that just made it all so much better.  And I'm talking about the bottom and edges being charcoal black and disintegrated.  Trying to get her back again after she threw our plates in front of us and ran off was ridiculous.  There was no point because she was done.  So she forgot to place our order, forgot to pick it up when it came out, ignored us until another worker (twice) sent her to our table, lied to us, didn't offer a dessert or a drink refill for myself.  Thankfully she did refill my son's lemonade while looking me in the eye and lying about the kitchen staff.  The vast contrast of service we received during those two visits was off the charts.  Therefore, lady, your tip is backed up.  Look for it in the mail."}
{"text":"We like the fajitas at the Chilies in Apple Valley, MN..  So, we tried the ones at Chilies on Signal Butte. They were so full of grissel  that you could not chew them. They were awful and we won't be going back. Cheap steak doesn't attract customers b"}
{"text":"I gotta start off by saying this place is pretty bad. Out of all the chili's i have eaten at this place went from being my favorite to being the one that i would never eat at. If someone said lets go to chili's i would say why dont we just not eat today. I have had to complain several times here. No im not the i want free food person. i always offer to play i always tell them i want to pay but the point is the food is horrible and service is almost always bad. from time to time when i got steak i could leave half on the plate because it was all fat and they never bothered letting the fries drain a little they just put them on the plate covered in grease till it was on the plate. all im saying is NEVER eat here. they may have changed cause i have not tried here in a couple of months but my visits were really bad."}
{"text":"Racists restaurant! The employees there tend to the white folk and disregard others. Terrible service. This is the second time this happens to us. We ordered the 3 for me $10 hamburger deal. You get an appetizer, hamburger and dessert. We waited about 20 min before the waiter brought out the chips and salsa as soon as he left it someone delivered the hamburgers. Last time I checked an appetizer and side salad are to be eaten prior to the meal. We ended up not eating the salad and chips because the hamburger and fries would get cold. The waiter was rude about it and the individual that delivered the hamburgers offered to keep the burgers under the lamp while we ate our salad/chips this doesn't go well with me because the hamburger would have gotten cold and the buns would have been soggy. This used to be the place to come for my family but after this experience I will not be coming back. Never did any one apologize and we still got charged for the items we didn't eat"}
{"text":"Ordered take out which was scheduled to be ready by 8:20....well 8:50 rolls around and I finally get my take out. The take out is right beside the kitchen and all you see and hear is yelling and cursing. Food was also below average which I expected from the chaos that was happening. Also, my apartment is 2 minutes from the restaurant and by the time I got home, everything felt like it was pulled straight out of the fridge."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed in today's lunch service.  It seemed pretty busy but there were empty tables so the restaurant wasn't at capacity.  The waitress we had was not great that's for sure.  We asked for a few minutes to decide what we wanted and probably within about 3 minutes she returned asking if we now knew what we wanted to order.  I felt rushed.  The food took well over 20 minutes to come out.  I received my food but my daughter didn't get her order only to find out the waitress forgot to put her order in.  The food was good but I was pretty upset about my child's order not being put in until my food came out.  Never once got a refill...she asked if I wanted a refill after I finished my meal, I said yes but she never brought it.  Pretty sure I won't be back."}
{"text":"Come here every two weeks or so. Favorite place to grub on. White spinach queso is delicious . We usually dont wait as much to be seated & if anything not longer than 10 min. Waiters might not be as efficient but definitely love the food."}
{"text":"The most expensive mimosa I have ever had, $15.89, insane! Granted it's the airport, and prices are typically high, but $15.89, outrageously ridiculous! Will never do that again.."}
{"text":"I am absolutely outraged by the experience I had at your establishment this evening and have never been treated so horribly at a place I spend my money on a regular basis. I was enjoying a Saturday night at Chili's, in Matthews when the greeter of the restaurant came to the table and ask myself and the member of my party did we come to complain since the original drink I ordered for the bar was made with traditional margarita instead of mango margarita mix. First off I never complained in the first place my waiter got this issue taken care of in a timely manner and she was great. I stated I'm able to tell the difference between the 2 drinks, I was in the restaurant and had a wonderful experience by the waiter Ryan. The doorman during this evening was Larry and my experience was absolutely horrible today first off if he's the greeter he has no business being all the way back by the tables near the kitchen. He called me a bougie bitc* and said he doesn't care if I tell the manager of."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. When I got there it was five minutes before anyone bothered to show up at the counter, then when she did, she informed me that they had to remake one of the orders due to a mistake. I asked how long and she said not long. She did bring me a large drink while I was waiting but it was full 12 minutes before the breath my order out. The order of onion rings that came with one of the burgers was ridiculously small. And the wait time to fix the one meal didn't fix the other two meals getting cold. Chili's dropped the ball on this one. Also, lose the Tip jar on the counter where they don't provide any service but bringing a bag of food to you. You pay the same amount as you would if you set down with your family, but you don't get any of the service refills etc. White tip? It's an annoyance, and you feel like a schmuck if you don't leave something."}
{"text":"I enjoy going in to sit down. The waitresses are always nice and the food is good. I don't recommend getting anything to go.. The last time I ordered the tilapia, it was cold and undercooked. Not really fair to get it then be disappointed as soon as I get home and can't eat what I paid for."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Love the ziosk for fast check out."}
{"text":"Though it can get busy( off the strip) they never rush me. Since this location is often busy I opt for the \" to go\" option that has 2 reserved parking spots for a quick and smooth order. Their food quality is always fresh and they'll remember your orders is you want your \"usual\" which is nice too. All in all a great location for me!"}
{"text":"I had a friend visiting me from California, and for some odd reason she and her party wanted to go Chili's. I was like... you came to Vegas to eat at Chili's?  But her party said they hadn't been there in a while. We were starving and they were pretty busy for a Saturday night. The wait time was 35 minutes. As a result we were starving and ordered right when we were seated.   My friend and I ordered under the 2 for $20 menu. I must say, I do like the options at Applebees better. We ordered the Texas Fries for  the appetizer, Cajun Chicken Pasta and  Original Baby Back Ribs. The Texas Fries were much smaller when they came out, and it was covered in cheese, jalepenos, and bacon bites. I didn't taste any bacon bites nor was it spicy at all. In fact, it was actually kind of cold.  The baby back ribs were pretty tasty, but they were kind of cold.  The Cajun Chicken pasta was not spicy at all. Maybe it was just the chicken that was suppose to be cajuny? The best part of the meal was the bread that came with the pasta! The food was mediocre and not tasty at all. It might have tasted better had it not been so cold? Who knows, though.   The service was pretty good. We were checkd on pretty often. The food quality just didn't match the service.  Maybe I've just been having problem and having cold food.... I like my food piping hot. I'm the type of person that likes hot soup in the middle of my Vegas summers."}
{"text":"I don't know what people are talking about. Just because it's a chain restaurant doesn't mean it's bad. I love their chips and salsa and always get the steak. I know it's not the best food for you but it's a nice treat to have once in a while."}
{"text":"This should be an interesting dinner.  Its colder in here than outside. I guess they don't know what the heat button is.  The food is definitely not going to stay hot for very long and the place needs cleaned very badly."}
{"text":"Had a delicious black bean burger with french fries. It came with the most delicious \"loaded baked potato soup\" (supposed to come with bacon in it, but they were kind enough make it without for me). Very friendly and nice staff! I was impressed!"}
{"text":"They have one of the best cookie in a skillet dishes around. Seriously sinful. I have actually never ordered anything here that wasn't good. It consistent. I've only encountered one snippy waitress over the many visits. Most are great"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in at 9 p.m. tonight. The store appeared to be about half full. The hostess said it would be a 10 minute wait. I asked why. Well, she said, gesturing to one half of the restaurant, this side is closed... (quite a few tables were occupied, and I could see staff cleaning two of the tables).... and on the other half, she said they had three servers working (I am quoting the hostess), but the open tables in that half of the store 'were dirty' so she could not sit us there.  Disregarding the fact that staff was already cleaning the closed area but not the open area, I dared to ask: what about the bar area? There was an open table with four chairs in the center of the bar area. No, she said. That table was \"reserved\" for \"larger\" parties of people. Really? Really. So, I said, there are chairs open in the bar area along one 1/2 wall and other patrons had obviously been sitting there recently because two empty beer bottlers were on the table. She said no, we couldn't sit there either because no servers worked that area and the bartender would be the only one serving.  I was so pissed. There were no other customers waiting - just us. So it wasn't like there were actually larger parties of four to sit in at the \"reserved table\" in the bar area either. This place is mediocre on their good days anyway, and with cops regularly patrolling both the restaurant and parking lot regularly, it has never given me any sense of ease. After this, I can guarantee they won't be getting any more of my business. Ever.(We left without waiting and the hostess clearly didn't care.)"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give Chili's another shot last night for dinner. We were seated immediately, but after 13 minutes of waiting on for the waitstaff to acknowledge us, we got up and left."}
{"text":"Sunday late evening eat out options are slim. However a yelp search told us that Chili's at Tyvola was open for another hour. We were seated quickly. After about ten minutes, our server came to take our drink orders. My husband ordered a strawberry lemonade, my son - water, and I a mixed berry margarita.  When our drinks arrived, my husband's strawberry lemonade magically transformed into iced tea. Not a big deal, it was swapped out. We placed our order. My husband and son would share a 2 for $20, with Texas fries as a start, sirloin steak for my son, chicken quesadilla for the hubby. I will have a bottomless soup and salad with vinaigrette dressing.  The Texas fries arrived to the table burnt. We would have returned it but could not find our server or any other staff. While my husband and son worked through the fries, I continued to search for our server to find out what happened to my tostada chips that come with the bottomless soup and salad. When I finally found her, she told me that I did not order the bottomless option, but okay, she'll amend the order. My chips arrived within five minutes, stale and chewy. A few minutes later, our meals arrived with ranch dressing for the salad as opposed to the vinaigrette I ordered.  My soup and salad were okay otherwise. My son loved his steak. The quesadilla my husband ordered was put down after two bites, it was barely edible.  After this experience, I wanted to only give one star. The only reason for the second star is due to my son's meal. Needless to say, I will not return."}
{"text":"Just a calm dinner on a Friday night with friends. We all had to work the next day so we just wanted to relax, visit and have a few cocktails with dinner. Shannon was our waitress and she was efficient and pleasant. Being on a diet, I tried the Mango Chicken and it was great and I had leftovers for work the next day."}
{"text":"Their Grilled Chicken Salad was so simple that I've experienced better at the other place or shall I say McDo was way better. I fell asleep waiting for our desserts. The only thing that amused me that night with my date was the small cash register that you can pay and play with it right on your table. My partner's burger was so good but not the salad."}
{"text":"Do not bother. It will take forever to get someone to take your order. It will take forever to get your food. It will take another 15-20 minutes to get a bill to pay. Don't bother pressing buttons on table for service. They don't do anything. I haven't seen this poor of service in years. Chilis's corporate should be ashamed to allow this to continue."}
{"text":"I was at dinner on a Monday evening and my server was so rude to myself and my girlfriend, I can't imagine where a young girl gets such a horrible attitude.  we had to send our order back because they put jalepenos on our  burgers twice.  Our chicken was raw and no management to be seen, we will not be returning to the waterworks mall chilis ever again."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited there today and I have been sick since I returned home.  First the waitress seemed upset that we came in to start with the napkins and silverware were thrown on to the table.  The food wasn't very good. My husband ordered a cup of chili which was terrible mush with a bitter canned flavor. He also had ribs and mac and cheese.  The ribs were dry and overcooked and the mac and cheese was horrible.  I had a carnita burrito which I only ate half of and within an hour I was sick. There was also a peach cobbler dessert that should have been served hot and it was barely warm.  The manager credited the cup of chili, but the the entire meal was terrible and I would never return.  It was a nearly 50.00 nightmare."}
{"text":"I'm a fairly regular Chili-head. Been to several restaurants in several states. I'm a 2 for $20 (2 for $22, now) kind of guy. I loves me some Margarita Grilled Chicken! I felt it necessary to leave a review after last night's service. Typical Friday night- busy. Restaurant seemed to be in a bit of disarray- a bit more than usual. Food was okay as usual, but our service was stellar. Came in with my wife as a last minute birthday meal last night to grab a quick bite. We had Melissa who was very attentive to us without being bothersome and on a night as busy as last, we were surprised. My wife even made a few comments about how great our service was during the hustle. Our drinks were never empty and our needs always met- I felt it absolutely appropriate to give credit where it is due and it is due to this server who made my night a little better by being so efficient and caring. Will come back in spite of this restaurant's flaws based on our experience. Muchos Kudos."}
{"text":"We had a great server who got all of our orders perfect without even writing them down.  Food was hot and delicious. We got seated right away even though the restaurant seemed packed. It was quite noisy due to the amount of people in the restaurant, but it pleasant because everyone talked to each other rather then staring at their phones."}
{"text":"My server was pretty nice guy but the food was kinda disappointing. I go to chilis a lot every location is mostly the same but this chilis has suck ass food presentation."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout and it was horrible. The ribs were delicious but everything else was a 1 star experience. The smoked chicken wings were dry and very small. The mashed potatoes were dry and tasteless. The cheese bites were terrible. Yuk. Very dissapointed."}
{"text":"Wow. Just fucking wow.10min wait to see out waitress, 50min wait for appitizers, and 1hr till we get the actual food.  This place is terriable. The chicken is never cooked fully so almost all my choices are out of the question. And when asked NOT to be seated in a cirten area cues they purposly coral all the screaming children in there we get some half ased excuse why they cant. Not to mention the rudeness of out waitress almost hitting us in the face with our cups and plates when shes passing them out.  All of this cues one group of 6 people was too much for them tonight. Ive worked survice and for fucks sake 6 people group mess you guys up out of a whole resturant of customers. Also this placr must be notorious for bad drinks. Thanks for advertising your Shittiest Margarita on the menue."}
{"text":"I had a enjoyable dinner ... Friendly staff, good service and excellet food"}
{"text":"I ordered the honey chipotle chicken tenders, corn on the cob, and broccoli. It was all cooked perfectly and tasted great. Service was great also. I sat at the bar top And the bartender had the entire bar area by herself so it was a little hectic, but typical for a bar. All around had a good experience. I'll go back"}
{"text":"Came on Friday night it was very busy and the service sucked. Our waitress threw the straws at us and it was just a bad experience. Definitely choose to spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went with family for my son's birthday on a Friday evening. Was pleasantly surprised that we were seated quickly.  Mentioned to server that it was  my son's birthday, expecting cake, singing etc.  Server was super nice, refilled drinks quickly.   Chips were fresh, but all stuck together and not completely cooked. Ordered queso, never saw it.  Food was ok tasty, I had half ribs with onion rings, received fries instead.  I immediately told server, she apologized and said she didn't up charge but would get them done immediately ( guess she forgot to put them in) ate my ribs and when server came to clear plates told her I never got rings, she apologized again and brought them out.   No celebration for son, we left with our doggie bag of onion rings.   Won't go back for a while if at all, lots of better places."}
{"text":"Don't typically leave bad reviews but this was by far the worst service I have ever had. Went there on a Saturday late afternoon and was seated right away. Restaurant was pretty dead. After over 20 minutes a waitress finally came to us and appolgized about wait and said she was the only real one working, the other three were trainees. Another 10 minutes before our drink orders were taken. About another 15 minutes till our food orders were taken. We didn't even get silverware or napkins. I walked around myself till I found the station they were kept at. Drink refills were really hard to get. Really happy I could pay the bill on the machine on the table or I would probably still be there. No visible manager. Not sure what was going on, first time and last time at this location. That's sad because I like Chili's and this is my closest location. I will continue to go to the Goodyear location so we can get decent service."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of chili's. Pretty good for the most part and a great value. 50 bucks at this place will buy you a lot... But, I was there for lunch earlier this week, and even though the food was very tasty, the utensils were absolutely filthy. I still ate my food after I tried to clean each, spoon, knife and fork with melted ice from my drink and a napkin. I will be back many many times because of the value, but hopefully they will improve the cleanliness on the silverware."}
{"text":"*************Has This Happened To You ????**********     **************There Were Plenty Of Vacant Tables Available*********   My wife and I WAITED a good solid 5 minutes at the hostess station ....... it was UNATTENDED for the entire 5 minutes. In addition another group was waiting behind us, for almost the same time period.  I asked a server who was passing by ...... wheres the hostess ...... he managed to find her.  At this point, we and the other group had been waiting for approximately 7-8 minutes.  The Hostess, based on her age appeared to be the Manager on Duty ......... informs BOTH PARTIES .... there will be a 5-10 minute wait.   NOT ACCEPTABLE, were the words expressed to hostess/manager by myself and the other party ...... she REFUSED to seat both groups, even though we had now been there a solid TEN MINUTES.  I and the other party, left WITHOUT DINING at Chili's...... I dined instead at Mimi's, and didn't have to put up with any attitude.  The Manager/Hostess was a Redheaded lady, probably in her early thirties.  This experience has left a BAD TASTE, in regards to Chili's and Brinker's.  Has a statement of my disgust, My family will be boycotting all Brinker's owned business."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Chili's I've ever been to. Food from the kids menu was disgusting. Ordered the kids mac n cheese and it was literally from a box. Our waitress only came to the table once and when she came it was awkward. The manager had an attitude. Took almost an hour to get our food. Terrible service. I hardly ever come to Vegas but when I make a trip back out here I certainly won't come back to this place."}
{"text":"Came out, really enjoyed the dinner for 2 for 22.. but I gotta say, Don is the man. Wasn't your plain old regular waiter. Kept it different, and was on point for as many tables as he had. The steak could've been a little better, my wife's looked really good. I didn't want to wait for another one so I sucked it up and ate it. Wasn't too bad, specially for the price."}
{"text":"I usually eat here but lately the place has been looking nicer tho the great customer service has definitely gone away. I asked for a booth to sit in and the host seated us at regular table in between two other tables with overweight people sitting at those tables so my little boys could not move their seats out to sit comfortably. I asked why are we at a table when we asked for a booth and the host said \"because the man that waits on that table u wanted said he was too busy and could not wait on a party of 5\"  anyway, we ordered our drinks and food from another man who said he was not our waiter but just helping out our waitress. One hour later we received our food and within that hour we needed refills on our drinks and not one person came over to ask if we needed a refill or of we needed anything for that matter.  I seen a couple waitresses at the other tables around us but none of them cared to take one extra step to our table. When we did start eating, the food was already cold and the burger i ordered (supposed to be medium) was burnt and the bread was dry and just breaking everytime I picked it up. So finally I had to flag someone else's waitress down and ask her for refills and napkins. How disappointing is that. I am done with this place."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service... we waited about 5 minutes after being seated for a server to come to our table. While eating, we found a wrapper of some sort in one of our bowls of soup. Called the server to our table, who in turn called over the manager... although they provided a new bowl of soup, we never received an apology from the manager nor a discount to our bill. We will not return to this Chili's location."}
{"text":"The place was packed and we actually almost left because it was so busy but ended up finding a table in the bar. The waitress was busy but at least came by and said she would be right back with us. She came back within 5 minutes and thanked us for our patience and thanked us for coming in! Her name was cameo! She took our order and while it took a little extra time, she was very attentive to our needs and had a smile on her face. Our food was great and the service from Cameo was exceptional!  5 stars because of the service!"}
{"text":"Food is definitely overpriced here, and the quality is lower than other Chili's. I've only ever eaten breakfast type stuff here, and would suggest staying with simple items like toast and bacon. The eggs benedict isn't very good here."}
{"text":"I had a 10 hour drive to Vegas and I just wanted some food for take out. I ordered on my phone and the confirmation said \"pick up time 9:50\" I came in earlier than the pick up time waiting for my food and once I walked in, no one greets you and literally it took 10 min for someone to see that we are there. I told her I'm waiting for my order and she said she will grab someone. 20 min later I'm sitting there and waiting and on the counter before I walked in there's a bag of take out and no one is helping us. I told the lady that if that is mine after 30 minutes 25 minutes of waiting and she was like \"idk what the other girl is doing I'm the back let me check\" and it was my order just sitting there. Super unorganized and no one wants to help. If I could give no stars i would. Ordering to go is supposed to be quick and a walk in and out procedure, instead I had the opposite and had to wait almost half an hour for food that is already sitting on the counter..."}
{"text":"This ace literally took forever to get my food for i felt like they forgot about me because it took my appetizers 1 hour to get to me. That isnt cool if ur in a hurry because i prefer to walk in then sit down and at least be snacking on something 10 minutes in"}
{"text":"The WORST food and the WORST service all in one. It took over 15 minutes just to get water. We did the two for twenty and had to send the chips and salsa back twice because they were both stale and cold. After nearly an hour of waiting for our food our waiter had forgotten about us. The manager brought out our main course and they were wrong. To top it all off the food was terribly undercooked. Once we finished \"eating\" it took another 15 minutes for someone to come by just so we could ask for our check. I usually enjoy my experience at Chilis but not this time. This was the absolute worst restaurant experience I have ever had. I recommend eating somewhere else when in the Matthews area."}
{"text":"Diane is a Rock Star server.  This is our second time here and we were lucky to have her as our server both times.  She checked in on us regularly and always made sure our drinks were always full.  She has an awesome attitude.  Friendly service with a smile.  The food was good but the service was great.   Thanks Diane.  Keep Rocking."}
{"text":"We've been going to Chilis for years and we love them! But everytime we order takeout from this location in Peoria there is something wrong with the food or order. Seriously, everytime. Whether it is the wrong dressing on the salads, not putting honey chipotle sauce on the honey chipotle chicken strips 100% of the time, or asking for cheese to not be on something and its taken off of everything but the item you specified. Of course you don't find until you are home and after a long day driving back and fighting for someone to read directions correctly usually isn't an option. At least the unsweetened iced tea never disappoints."}
{"text":"Please don't complain about getting sick when you do at this place because if you do the manager here is very rude, sarcastic and shows zero empathy for his restaurant. Brought my wife for her birthday to celebrate today, it did not take 20 minutes after we left for 4 of five were sick with the runs right after. We call the manager and he did not care at all. What a jerk seriously, who the heck gets sick right after eating. Someone who may have eaten at a dirty restaurant. This complaint is going to the health department today. Bad service bad food."}
{"text":"I love Chili's. This is yet my favorite restaurant. Every time I come the food is delicious. Especially the Chicken Nachos, MY FAV!! always eat as an appetizer. and also if you sign up for e-mails, you get awesome coupons! Always use it, either a free appetizer or dessert.  OHMYGOSH! the Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie, have to eat every time I go! Its beyond delicious!   This restaurant never disappoints me :)"}
{"text":"Our whole family just loves Chili's. We eat there often and the food is great and the service is EXCELLENT!! If there's ever anything that's not to your liking, they make it right. We love everybody there!!"}
{"text":"Sunday night, near hotel, not wanting to hunt down anything new figured we'd stick with tried & true tonight after a day of driving. Mistake unfortunately.  Husband got burger & fries, I got soup & salad. No major complaints with the food, or the wait staff, though hubby's fries & my soup was cool. Left too long on the counter? The incredible NOISE that drove us out after a single drink & dinner.   When did Chili's become a sports bar? the volume going on TV was so loud that when our server came to the table, we couldn't hear him. Couldn't hear each other talking to each other. It was mind boggling. Everyone in the restaurant of course increased their volume to hear over each other, eh, noise goes up.  After asking the server about it, they turned it down some, claiming that the guys at the bar wanted it turned up. Really? when do a few knuckleheads at the bar 4 feet from the tv dictate what an entire restaurant is forced to listen to? or that single station? The music playing the restaurant couldn't be heard at ALL it was so loud.  We love Chili's & have visited them in several states. This one gets a big thumbs down."}
{"text":"Not happy at all....couldn't enjoy my meal... Idk what I found on my drink but that shit was not acceptable..wont  be coming back.. PS: CHILLIS HAS JASON (SEVER) TO THANK FOR THE BAD REVIEW"}
{"text":"We went in the afternoon, and decided to make it dinner too.  Ordering from the lunch menu, we both had soup and an entree.  Plenty of food for us, and probably for anyone of average size.  We each ordered a different soup and then taste-tested each other's.  My Southwest Chicken soup was to die for.  My husband had the Chicken tortilla with all the cheese, and his was good, but mine was better!  He had the lunch double burger and loved it.  I had the Chicken quesadilla and loved it too.  Probably a little smaller in size than an evening full size hamburger or quesadilla, but plenty for us.  Loved all of it, including the strawberry leomonade!  Our server was efficient and attentive and made great suggestions.  All in all a really excellent experience.  Thanks, Chili's.  We have to go here more often!"}
{"text":"Decent most of the times cooked well. The last dinner we had my wife's broccoli was half cooked and raw. Not horrible but definitely a mishap. We hate sending food back as you never know what's going to come out with it. Not a disaster we probably be back."}
{"text":"This is my second trip to this location.  Its ok, nothing that's gonna make me give a 5 star rating. The server was friendly...well at least when he came to the table. We didn't see him much. Oh, and just FYI,  if you order Root Beer it comes in seperate bottles, no refills of course.And to make things better,  server told our bill was ready and left. So we paid at the table. No offer of to go boxes or anything. So I got up and got the containers myself. As we left, no one batted an eye. Heck, I could've walked out with plates and silverware and not one employee would've noticed. Food is great, service severely kacking"}
{"text":"Wouldn't be bad if it didn't take so long in the bar area. Waited for over a half hour for food that was ordered ahead of time and told it would be ready when I got there to take out. The bartender, think his name was Carlos, seemed to hate his job and interacting with people. While I was waiting, he would make comments to his boss \"their own fault, I don't care\". As if customers weren't present. As I was waiting, also noticed walk in customers getting their orders already. How is it possible that an order that was out in the previous day is taking longer than a same day order? No apologies or explanation was offered either. Brought it up to a gentleman and he said it's probably because I did it wrong on tr website (I called and spoke to someone over the phone when ordering) I also brought up that I've done this every month the last 5 months so doesn't make sense why this time is such a mess up. Interesting experience to say the least. Feel bad for the people at the bar if that's their service. Don't order carry out or dine it at this location of you expect customer service."}
{"text":"Headed home after a busy weekend in Vegas. Stopped into Chilis with my wife and kids. Very busy but a short wait. We were tired and a little defeated by Vegas. Michael, who was either the shift supervisor or manager, waited on us. He was polite, friendly, and attentive. We were served right away and the food was delicious and on time. Best Chilis experience to date. I might even goes as far as saying that our Chilis lunch was the highlight of our weekend! Thank you Michael and thank you Chilis."}
{"text":"In town to visit relatives. A short visit. Staying at the hotel park and decided to grab dinner before it was too late for my toddler son. He wasn't feeling well so instead of driving we took a walk on the nice evening to Chili's. Our hotel said it was right up the street and it was a short walk away. Arrived and promptly seated. The restaurant is a little less than half full around 6:45 pm on a Thursday evening.   I haven't been to a Chili's in years so I had no idea to to expect but I know I probably won't be eating dinner inside with this toddler as it is close to his bedtime. The hostess is too kind and offers a high chair twice along with some crayons wrapped in a coloring book. She tells me about Chili's Rewards. My waiter is fast, a nice gentleman Sean, who greets my son first then me. I love when people acknowledge your kids. He asks me about beverages and if I want something for my son. He comes back with drinks and asks me about my menu options. At this time my son has taking a liken to to the paper wrapped silverware. And he is beating them on the table like drums. He loves all things musical and even plays the tambourine all day while at church. It isn't too loud and the venue as I said isn't crowded.   As Sean is taking my menu items, another waiter, a black gentleman and I am black as well, comes up to the table with no salutations or greetings to either my son or I and just takes the silverware from my 23 month old sons hands and places them away from him on the center of the table. I proceed to order my food then ask for the manager. Because I was completely thrown off by what just happened in front of my face.   1. You did not greet me. 2. You did not greet my son. 3. You took something out of my sons hand. 4. You did not ask me if you could approach my son or take something out of his hand.  5. You did not say a word to me. No comment that my son was disturbing other guests.  6. In order to place the utensils on the table in front of you had to reach over me as I was ordering my food.  7. You walked away as if nothing happened.  8. You offered no apology after I spoke to 2 managers requesting that you apologize.  9. You proceeded to avoid any contact with me. Not a real man. Definitely not the man who boldly walked over to take something out of my sons hands.   The manager comped my meal. And apologized on behalf of the server, Marcus, who was both rude and disrespectful. The whole ordeal could have been avoided if Marcus would have said something to me, the parent, instead of reprimanding my child as if it was his own by avoiding conversation with me and taking the liberty to remove something out of his hand again without my consent.   He essentially touched my child and I doubt if someone could touch your child unless it was life threatening with you present without you having something to say. I waited as my food was prepared and Marcus so boldly avoided me and any opportunity to offer an apology. I found it interesting that the security guard made his way over to my area to stand and wait as well. He stared into my face multiple times and watched me like a hawk. Could a 5'5 woman with a toddler so scare an establishment that security has to be called over because they are afraid I'm going to approach Marcus and what, demand the apology that I so rightly deserved? When I asked the guard if there was a problem because I hadn't seen him the entire time of my visit until my request for an apology. He stated he worked here and that is no issue. No, it was a case of discrimination, disrespect and negligence that they didn't want to hold Marcus accountable for. The managers did apologize but I told them it should come from Marcus. They said they could ask him but they couldn't make it as they would deal with him individually. The truth is they probably never said a word.  The combo fajita and chicken tender platter was actually good. While I wouldn't patron such a disgusting establishment that allows certain servers to do whatever they want to do to customers and their children for that matter without demanding that a real man or woman apologize for their short coming or mistakes, you are free to do so. I guess this behavior is tolerated in the South. Not, coming from where I'm from. You don't ever disrespect a parent or a child, period. You are not his dad or parent, who was down the street.  And a security guard doesn't scare me. I did nothing wrong. There goes a place perpetuating stereotypes. I won't be bullied.  I hope you find this review helpful in determining the most welcoming establishments to eat as a family while in Charlotte. And lord help you if you take a tired toddler who makes too much noise. The servers will take it into their own hands to remove anything that disturbs others without talking to you. That's the last time I visit a Chilis. And I have already written Corporate."}
{"text":"Came here with a group for dinner, I ordered a half rack of ribs with traditional sauce. When it came out I was really concerned with why a half a rack is $10, and there was literally no meat on my ribs and the whole half a rack was so small. I sent it back, I told the waiter that I'm not paying $10 for some small bones slathered with some mediocre sauce. All in all, it was a terrible experience, the coke was good though. Even though it was $3."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you plan on getting sauces for your food. The food was ok but im a big sauce person when eating and i dont enjoy a shit ton of water in my sauces. Even the strawberry topping for the cheesecake was wattery. Im only getting foods that dont reqire sauce for now on."}

{"text":"This is our favorite Chili's in the valley.  We have tried other Chili's in Vegas and they do not compare."}
{"text":"This is a place that understands how to cook fish. Tilapia with mango salsa is a great dish, perfectly cooked. Salsa is spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. They do the same dish with chicken which is also very good. Good happy hour pricing in margaritas. Service was attentive. Love the table kiosk where you can pay when ready."}
{"text":"It took close to 45 minutes to get our food. I had the California Turkey club and my wife had the Big Mouth bites. I had two of the bites and they were dry and burnt. The half of the Turkey club I had was average at best. Not impressed and we will not be back. What a disappointing meal!!"}
{"text":"My Tacos were cold, rice was not cooked and my beans tasted like straight pepper. The wait staff was kind but that was about the only thing I can say positively about this place. Was not very clean and I definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Terrible experience at this location.  The service was slow and the server kept forgetting our order.  We sat for 15 minutes before anyone even stopped by our table.  Drink orders came out wrong.  Avoid this location."}
{"text":"I'm comparing this Chili's to the one on Shea in Scottsdale.  This was a Sunday at about #:30-ish.  There was no wait although the room was packed.  Our server was quick, pleasant, and as a long time ago server myself, hit all the required steps with perfect timing and a smile.  I always stick to my favorite dish, the Triple Dipper.  I'm crazy about chicken crispers, so they were two of my choices, with the third being southwestern eggrolls.  I've had this at least 6 times before at other Chili's.  The bad news was one bite of the egg roll sent me into spasms of choking and coughing and left my throat burning.  Someone went to town with the cayenne pepper or hot peppers.  I tried it again at the end of the meal and it again set my mouth on fire.  There has always been a little kick to these but NEVER enough to choke me and burn afterward.  The chicken crispers were surprisingly disappointing.  They were not burned or dry, but were far from fresh.  All the other times I've had them there has been a loud crunch at the first bite of freshly cooked coating, then the juices surround my mouth with butter soft delectable chicken.  Even drowning them in the ranch dressing didn't help.  They were edible, but not noteworthy.  Probably what you would get from a pouch of frozen breaded chicken once it had been dipped in the deep fryer basket again to serve hot.  This is not the usual Chili's experience, so I can't blame the chain.  But I blame the manager for caring more about filling seats than the quality of the food.  I'll stick to my beloved Scottsdale Chili's on Shea where I've never been disappointed, even once."}
{"text":"Wow just WOW.  Typically we avod these chains like the plague cause they over priced, the service is horrible and you leave feeling bloated, broke and unsatisfied.  NOT TRUE HERE!  I think we saw 4 or 5 servers during our dinner, bringing different items including our meal. They were so nice and attentive but not up our grill. It was like they telepathically knew when I needed a new drink as I was thinking it. Totally chill with our lil one to.  The food was cooked perfectly. I actually ate an entire big mouth burger, the avacado burger. My wife had the sirloin steak, with the most amazing orgasm in your mouth loaded taters!   Yes...I said...taters.. lol  Fast service, friendly servers, good food... not much more to ask for!  Ohh and Lee, he made baloon animals for the kids made lucy a pink poodle. He was friendlty and we felt bad for not having stripper cash (ones) to give him.  Anyways go forth and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been going to this location for 12-13 years and usually everything is okay. On Wednesday, 5/11 we sat in booth at bar. Finally after moving slowly drinks arrived. Ordered food..wife had salmon and I ordered chicken crispers. Food comes out but waitress tells me the fries are still cooking. Since i prefer all of my food together at one time, I waited for fries before I would eat.  I didn't want my wife to wait because didn't want her eating cold fish. While waiting on fries, waitress walked by me at least 5 times and other peoples orders were coming out with fries. I flag down waitress and she acted surprised when I told her I am still waiting...like they should have  magically appeared on my table without her bringing them to me. She goes back to kitchen. Finally after to continue waiting the fries come out. i told the waitress this was unacceptable since my wife was 90% done with her meal and my chicken and broccoli were cold ans I wanted to speak to the manager. Manager comes out and asks me what the problem is like he didn't already know. I explained my unhappiness with the service. He asks if comping my meal would be acceptable. I told him yes. My meal was $10.29 but when I got the bill he only comped me $6.61. I can't tell you how pissed I was that he lied to me after my dinner was pretty much ruined. I would typically leave at least an $8 tip which was more than 20% but since I blame the waitress and the manager both i left a $3 tip.  I don't believe I'll be going back to this location for a long time at least until they get a better manager who can provide better service and won't lie to me."}
{"text":"We had a 15 min wait to be seated which we expected at 715. We had a 10 min wait to place a drink order, 28 minute wait for our food once ordered.  It was over cooked and not good. Presentation was terrible. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Went to chilli's with a friend because I had a gift card. We had the $35 deal and its was good for a chain restaurant. The best part of the evening was the fantastic service we had from Chantelle. She was top notch!"}
{"text":"We went to cash in a new gift card. The blonde waitress said that its value lowered to $0 over time, but we later found out that was a rumor. This is very sickening, and I can't say I'll ever trust Chili's again."}
{"text":"Service still very slow in the bar area but the servers are very nice and helpful"}
{"text":"Nice clean place. Good food. Malcolm is a great waiter. Very attentive like everyone else that works here. Seems like they all help each other."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but Chili's really wins me over. Everything on the menu tastes good. EVERYTHING.   My personal favorites are; Wings over buffalo, southwestern eggrolls, nachos, big mouth bites, and the MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE. MMM it is so good you need to get it if you go there, ok? You absolutely need to.   Anyhoo, the menu is very reasonably priced. Whenever I go here on lunch dates with my friends, we love to split their appetizers to eat as our entree's, because for the pricing they are rather generous. For example; we will order the queso as an appetizer and then the appetizer Big mouth bites and split that for our entree. Sometimes we will even get dessert! And the bill is 18.00 (if we get water). So, 8 bucks a person for delicious queso with homemade chips, 2 mini burgers that are to die for with friends, and half of a chocolate explosion? Sounds like a good deal to me."}
{"text":"Date night with my honey .burgers were good served was very nice. We come at least once a month"}
{"text":"Service was so-so not sure who our waiter was and we sat without drinks for long periods of time. It wasn't very busy. Don't order any water it tasted like it came out if a dusty garden hose. They told me from the last storm it started tasting that way"}
{"text":"Dear Mr. Chili Manager,  I am finding it hard to find the words to express the roller coaster of emotions I felt at my most recent trip to your Grill & Bar.  My husband and I noticed that you have brought back your 2 for $20 deal once and for all and decided to take you up on your offer.  Upon being seated we were greeted by a young lady who I believe her name was Ruth.  We advised her that we will be partaking in the 2 for $20 special and ordered the Cheeseburger and Chicken Crispers (which by the way why are there two versions?? It is very confusing and unnecessary).  For our appetizer we indicated we would love to feast on the Texas Cheese Fries with no jalapenos.  A few minutes later, as i sipped on my delicious strawberry lemonade, Ruth delivered our cheese fries.  As she placed them on the table she immediately took them back as she realized we had asked for no jalapenos and sure enough the little green monsters were sprinkled throughout our batch of fries.  No big deal mistakes happen.  Less than 2 minutes later she returns with our new order... or so I thought.   Here is where the plot thickens.   As my husband began to dive in to our appetizer I couldn't help but notice the placement of the fries seemed to look exactly has they had when they had jalapenos on top.  I hesitantly take a fry and notice they seem a tad spicier than they should.  My wheels are turning.. is my mind playing tricks on me?  I express my concern to my husband and ask if we have just been bamboozled and reserved the same batch of fries?  I feel my angry eyes being activated...  If I just wanted to pick off the jalapenos I would have done it myself.  I begin to think.. oh no who picked them off was it our server?  Were her hands clean?  My husband is chuckling at my freak out he said he would ask and take care of it.  Sure enough after asking our server she confirmed that was in fact the case.  My husband in trying to stress the wrongness of doing that saying he was allergic and that we wouldn't want to see his face swell and turn red.  She apologized and said that when most people ask for no jalapenos its just because they don't like them.  Okay first of all, if I ask for no jalapenos I shouldn't have to indicate if it is a preference or a medical condition.  Secondly, news flash if you pick them off there is still seeds and juices that can still reek havoc on the fries and cheese.  And lastly, I don't care whatever the reason, if the order is wrong I think the proper procedure would be to do a re-fire.  Isn't here health codes for a reason? I believe that Miss Ruth realized the error in her ways.  Especially because now our entrees arrived pretty much at the same time as our appetizer because of this situation.  I gave you two stars because I do give Ruth a A for effort as she must have apologized 5 or 6 times during our meal and even offered a free dessert for our troubles.   Mr. Chili Manager.. please tell me this is an isolated incident and not how you train your staff to fix orders.  Unfortunately, I will forever remember your location as the \"Jalapeno Picker Outer\" spot."}
{"text":"Hopefully you never get Erica as a server. She was very rude, rushed, and does not know the golden rule. She argues when questioned. I think because we all look younger she thought we wouldn't tip well, her mistake.  WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS CHILIES!"}
{"text":"Garbage food has the favor of crap does not taste real"}
{"text":"I absolutely love,  love this Chili's!  I had a bad experience at Applebee's just down the street. Applebee's ruined our great family night until... we came to Chili's!  The hostess Nina greeted us with a huge smile and seated us right away. Then our waitress Toni came and greeted us (who by the way had a great smile ) took our drink order. Then the manager came to our table to greet an apologize for our bad experience at Applebee's. We got our appetizers quick, and our food right after by Nico which was excellent.  Toni came by several times to check on us. We will definitely not go back to Applebee's and will frequent this Chili's location more often. Love the employee staff at Chili's!  Go in and see for yourself!  Thank you again Nina, Toni, Nico and of course the manager Patrick!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, good price and great service. I had the fortune of being seated by the bar and I was helped by the Jason duo. Yeap Jason and Jason. Their service was on point and even though they were busy on a Saturday night, they used good humor constant smiles and good vibes to make the wait fun"}
{"text":"I am so impressed. Much better now that the remodel is done. I went to dinner with my parents and boyfriend about 6pm. I was shocked to have been seated right away. We use to have to wait at least 20 min before. Our server was Kayla and she was on top of it all night. We got queso dip. The chips are a thin but perfect salt crisp. If you want chips and salsa i would order the queso dip cause you get the salsa as well. My mom and I ordered the 2 for 20 deal. We shared a new appetizer, the spicy panko onion rings, and they were soooo good! She got her usual chicken fajitas and I got the steak. Lots of flavor in each! My dad ordered his usual, he swears it's the best salad in the world, Santa fe chicken salad. My boyfriend had a burger and devoured it in just a few min. To say the least, we had a great dinner and service! Our drinks were always filled and our chips never ran out. Again, kudos to Kayla, she is wonderful."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable!! Everyone on staff was so nice and welcoming!!!! Food came out extremely fast. Drinks and food were delicious!!! I will definitely be coming back. Kudos to this location!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner and I ordered a new steak that they had on the menu  and asked that they didn't put the spicy sauce on it and that I'd like it medium-well, everything else I kept the same, not too difficult of an order. The steak came out and it was medium rare so I asked if they could cook it longer. At this restaurant two servers wait on one table so the other girl brings my steak back out and it is cooked longer but they put the spicy sauce on it. I tell the girl I can't eat it due to a food allergy and she looks irritated and takes it back. Ten seconds later the other guy comes back out with my same steak but the sauce is gone, they just wiped it off! By this time my husband was done with his meal so I said forget it, I'm not going to wait for a whole new steak at this point. The manager came out and said she would take mine off the bill (I would hope so considering I didn't eat it). We were both extremely dissatisfied. I went home and had a bowl of cereal for dinner."}
{"text":"Saturday at 5:30pm, 45 minute wait with 13 open tables. Manager said, \"it will KILL my kitchen if I sit all of those tables\".  I'm thinking, \"we'll that's a testament to your ability to manage and organize\". How the heck work Will they handle a true dinner rush?"}
{"text":"We arrived at the Carolina Mall Chili's around 8 PM on Friday night.  The hostess said it would be a 20 minute wait.  That was odd because I could see 5 or 6 empty tables from where we were standing and the parking lot had been half empty when we arrived, they weren't busy.  After about 10 minutes a lady came from the dining area to complain.  She said they had been waiting at the table 18 minutes and nobody had even taken their drink order.  A few minutes later the lady and her family came out and told them it had now been over 20 minutes with no service and they were leaving.  We decided to leave and not be seated.  Another family that was waiting to be seated left as well.   We went down the street to Applebees (hadn't been there in years).  Wow what a difference.  The place was packed but they seated us immediately.  A smiling, friendly waitress immediately took our drink order.  All the staff was upbeat and cheerful.   We've had one too many bad experiences trying to have dinner at Chili's - glad to find a great alternative at Applebees."}
{"text":"Service was slow but friendly. Food was as expected (standard chili's fare, no better, no worse). The raspberry margarita is great."}
{"text":"I have frequented this Chili's a couple of times. The very first time I visited I was thoroughly impressed. Our waiter was genuine and so friendly. I have a daughter with special needs and often times when we go out wait staff tends to be stand offish, but not this gentleman. I wish I could remember his name but I did ask for the manager and gave a raving review at the time of our visit. The second and third times I went here I was not as impressed. The wait staff was not nearly as friendly and the last time I went there I seriously felt like my daughter and I were an inconvenience even though we were the only people in the restaurant for a good 20 minutes. The food is always good however, and I will more than likely still return."}
{"text":"Their to go staff runs way too behind and are completely unfriendly. They are so forgetful, twice they've had to come out to my car because they nearly forgot something I can only imagine what else they have forgotten I'll find out when I get to my destination."}
{"text":"Looked slammed...But..SURPRISE!!! No wait... Friendly people. Quickly acknowledged. Maybe we are in the calm before the storm? Parking lot suggests the area restaurants are slammed. :)  Love the chips n salsa. Don't come that often... But almost always enjoy myself."}
{"text":"Warm, savory, spicy what more could you ask for! I live 15 minutes from here so you'd think everything would get cold. This is the only place that is consistent with keep they food hot. And they are very friendly when helping. They get the order out to you fast with out delay."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of coming back here!  Waited 5 minutes for hostess to come out of the back.  Waited another 5 minutes for her to clean off a table when half of the restaurant was empty!  Terribly understaffed!  Never saw the manager.  Had to ask for napkins after our food got there.  Not more napkins, but any napkins at all!  My beer and my son's drink were completely empty.  Had to flag down  our \"server\" to get refills.  She came back 5 minutes later to tell me they were changing kegs and it would be another 10 minutes.  Quite possibly the absolute worst service and experience I have had in the last ten years!  Told my son, who chose the place, that was the absolute last time I will step foot in that mess of a restaurant.  Absurd!!"}
{"text":"The staff is way too busy in the kitchen to service the customers - not a good experience this evening."}
{"text":"Same as every other main stream so called bar and grill. Overpriced and the staff doesnt seem to be friendly when its busy. I used to really enjoy coming here years ago, but when they shut down most of the restaurants within the valley the service really took a hit. The food is just ok depending on what you get, and nothing has a wow factor. Its a freaking Chilis, just not what it used to be..."}
{"text":"We went to Chili's on Friday for a belated anniversary dinner. It has been awhile sine I went to Chili's, but I realized Friday what I had been missing. The burger was very juicy came out pretty quickly. Andrew was our server and he was very nice and made sure we always had what we needed. The Texas Cheese Fries are to die for in my opinion. I wish you could have that on the side instead of their regular fries. I would actually pay a $1 more for the meal if they offered that with the entree. I will be back very soon. Maybe I will try their new pizza next time."}
{"text":"This location is a joke. Seriously the worst service I have ever experienced. 2 hours for two salads, one of which was made wrong twice! And then we were double charged on our check. And not a single apology."}
{"text":"I normally enjoy Chilis for the occasional meal. It's the typically chain, but this location is shabby, and in need of a good scrubbing. The wait staff for lunch in an almost empty restaurant was slow and not friendly. We ordered the fajita lunch special, but after we finished our drinks and it still hadn't arrived, decided to bag it up and take it home. The waiter seemed very put out that he'd have to bring it out bagged. Took another 15 minutes of waiting.   When we did finally get to eat it, the food was just...meh. Small portions and entirely unremarkable. With so many other chain options in this price point, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Have been coming here with family for years....last few trips the service and seating have been horrible - seems they have cut so much staff, no one is around to serve customers."}
{"text":"Go sit in bar for drinks. In the dining area you will get great or lousy service depending on server.  One of the best places to eat in the Whitehall area. Very good standard food chain.  Tables for groups is nice."}
{"text":"So wanted to try something a little different (as chains go) on McKnightmare road, and as I have not been to this Chilis in quite some time (and for the life of me I cannot figure out why... ) I thought we would tie on the feed bag here tonight, and this visit to Chilis is NOT starting off well.   The hostess is CLUELESS!! She could not buy a clue with all of the money in Brooklyn. My wife, mother in-law, twin omnivores, and I have been waiting here about 40 minutes on a FIFTEEN minute wait. Every time that I question her, she tells me we are the next table. Next table where on the moon??  Once we were seated, things didn't get much better. The waitstaff (Jessica) was rather dismissive and (in my opinion) seemed put out. Getting her attention was slightly harder than finding and collecting hens teeth. What was also like finding hens teeth, was getting our appetizer. Waiting...and waiting... And did I say STILL waiting!!! 20 count em' 20 minutes later voila, here comes my appetizer WITH a dinner chaser. Yes dinner came right along with appetizer. Imagine that!!   The twin eating machines went with the little chicken crispers, corn on the cob, and lemonade and at $4.99 ehh it was kind of hard to mess that up. My wife had the ribs, and while it was nicely done I feel the size was NOT worth the price. She left very unsatisfied.  My in law had the turkey sandwich (which I will never understand) and it was zoo soo stuffed with meat, that she could not finish it. This was about the only positive experience tonight.   Finally my classic bacon cheeseburger. Just a word of advice. Don't waste your time and or money.  I finally realize while it has been such a long long since my last trip to Chilis. And I see why it will be a very long time before my next trip to this location. I gave them two stars because I have jet to eat at a one star establishment. I always say that I vote with my feet and my dollars. Rest assured it will be quite some time before either return!!"}
{"text":"We went to Chili's at 11:30 A.M for brunch. The music was so loud, conversation was next to impossible. NOT only was it loud, it was heavy metal-headbanging music! Who wants to listen to that for a nice quiet brunch hour? I could see it if was at a Happy Hour time. My other negative is....Why can't beef be served with the fajitas at that time of day instead of only after 4:00 P.M.? I don't care for pork and the chicken is dry."}
{"text":"One of my favorite chili's I've had. Good food and well attentive staff. Could have been cleaner though."}
{"text":"we were seated right away. staff was speedy and polite. the food was good except the fries were over salted. other wise no complaints.  one waiter was kind enough to call us a cab and then call them again when they didn't show up."}
{"text":"Went back tonight to try again. Last time they sat me and didn't come back for 30 minutes until I left without evening ordering a drink. I thought maybe it was a fluke. But no. Tonight they had people waiting on benches with over half the place empty. I stood for 10 minutes waiting to put my name in. Jesus what a slow place."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday 9/9/16. The service was horrible! The staff had no idea of which sections they were working and after being seated we had to wait 30 minutes before anyone even asked us what we wanted to drink! The management is clearly at fault. I will not go back to this restaurant. There are too many better options."}
{"text":"The sour cream and lettuce on my chicken tacos were unreasonable cold.  One star!"}
{"text":"Currently writing this review sitting on the toilet, after recently returning from a visit to this location. Ugh.   Host was nice, seated right away in a quiet section as requested. Server was prompt, nice, and attentive. Have never been to this location and needed plenty of extra time to get acquainted with the variety of dinner options featured.   Started with the Skillet Queso with tortilla chips and salsa. There is nothing \"queso\" about it at all. It is actually very identical to the Hormel chili dip recipe in looks and most definitely taste. It was ok. The chips were good as was the salsa.   Decided on an old-timer burger and the southwest burger. Both cooked to spec and well presented. Overall both decent, and the fries were actually really good.  My biggest issue is these new table tablets, or whatever they are called. Concept seems good if you want more drinks, but it just tends to be a waste of space when you really have no need to play the games for 2$ or need anything extra when you run out. The only saving grace is the option to settle the check yourself. It is gift card friendly, and you are able to apply that first before paying with credit card. You can also apply a tip to be included, but who knows if or how much your server receives.  With that said, I feel as if there is plenty of opportunity for people to just get up and walk out without really paying. It's essentially an honors system when being given a chance to pay for your check without waiting an unreasonable amount of time to get one  to settle. Perhaps that will be the downfall of these new systems, assholes just not paying on the tablet and walking out. No one really checks to make sure your doing it, and they really don't check to make sure you did when you leave. So it will be interesting to see how that plays out.  Overall it was a decent experience. Not bad at all and am considering a second visit despite how my stomach currently feels."}
{"text":"What one menu item would you expect to remain on the menu at Chili's? Wrong, they took chili off the menu (at least the airport did.) the salmon was excellent even though I had my heart set on terlingua chili. The waiter was attentive, but the kitchen was slow. I appreciate that Chili's has fresh brewed iced tea, but overall they will lose my business since I only eat there for the chili."}
{"text":"The wait was over 30 minutes and the waiter was next to the worst.  Even the mgr offer us a free dessert, but then the waiter said it was only for one. Smh!r If I wanted to I could buy this place."}
{"text":"For what you expect from a chain resteraunt, its decent. Just don't go in there expecting it to blow you off your feet. The wait staff was okay, we could see that there were open seats but we weren't seated until a little bit after that, but it wasn't terribly long.   All in all, it was an average experience,  Ok food, Ok service, and Ok atmosphere. I only stopped here on a trip but I will continue to go to Chili's in my area."}
{"text":"Will never come back again. Nobody to seat you. Since I know the bar side is open seating we sat ourselves. People look at you like we were not suppose to be there. Waited 10 min with nobody saying anything so we left. What a joke! PS the place was 25% capacity"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in about 4 years and won't ever go back.    I used to love Chili's .After thy closed the location o Green Valley Parkkwy, I tried the one on Eastern 2 different time.   The service was extremely slow and the food was ho hum.    I can get ho hum at burger king.   Typical corporate place..........cut back to save pennies while pissing off customers that won't come back."}
{"text":"Service was fine and the place was clean, but the reduced menu doesn't give many options.  Eat before you come to the Las Vegas airport..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food especially the fried asparagus and the prime rib tacos. Great time."}
{"text":"this place sucks! horrible service. took an hour to get dry nasty food. stay away!! don't bother coming here. they obviously have no clue what they are doing."}
{"text":"Hey yall, Heads up on this place. I specifically downloaded this app to make this review!  Well,  I got water on time great right? It's not even busy!  Well husband's got silverware with food still on it! Yes food still on the silverware!!  Carrying hot food over my 3 year olds head from the kitchen. Tables aren't being bussed. Hell there's no bussers just 10-12 waiters.  Which they are living up to their name. Nothing but waiting and waiting. 45min till food arrived.   It's good I'll give them that but as far as coming back to this one I WILL NOT!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! been seated for over an hour and food still hasn't come out!?!?! and we waited 45 minutes at the door.. and my daughter finish 3/4 of a frozen movie and still no food,  and it's slow! !!!"}
{"text":"What I would expect from a Chilis restaurant chain. We were seated right away, and service was good. They have these tablets at the table where you can refill drinks, however we still had to ask our waitress for the drink after several minutes of waiting. The food tasted good and got out to us in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"This is the worst review I have ever given restaurant. I waited 1 hour to get food and drink.  The manager did nothing except make excuses.   Totally  understaffed and poorly managed. I will never come back."}
{"text":"My 3 year old son and I popped into chilis today for a late lunch and we were greeted and seated right away. After a quick trip to \"go potty\" we returned back to our table and our server was right there to take our drink order. She came back and I put in my kiddos order right away but still needed time for myself. She came back and checked to see if I was ready to order, of course I wasn't. She brought out my sons corn dog and fries and I placed my order. He devoured his corn dog so it must have been delicious! I ordered a trip of appetizers and it was all delicious! The fried cheese bites, whatever they are called are awesome! And the southwest egg rolls were delicious! The sliders were an ordinary slider, I think I will try something different next time! After a little while my kiddo was ready to go so I asked for a Togo box and the check, because I paid cash... but those little boxes at the table to pay with card are awesome if you need to go quickly!! We had a great lunch date and will definitely return! I wish I could remember our servers name, she was awesome!! Thanks for the great experience!!"}
{"text":"My first time at a Chili's in Arizona, and I would say I had an overall good experience. The wait to be seated was a little long, but that was to be expected at 6 o'clock on a Friday. Once seated, our server came immediately, and she brought us our drinks quicky. After ordering, the food came out very quickly, and it tasted very good. I would say it was a very pleasent dinner experience."}
{"text":"Went in thinking the meal and drinks would be as good as at other locations. The waiter too forever to great our table. Took almost 15 minutes to get a glass of water and even longer to get the mixed drink that was ordered first. Had to send both steaks back to the kitchen because they were super fatty. Long story short the 2 for $20 deal and 2 drinks each for myself and my partner cost a few pennies shy of $60 bucks. I will not go to chillies on N. Decatur again. Super slow service and extremely expensive just not worth it."}
{"text":"We rode out bike here, came in the door around 7:45 and the lady said they can't serve any new guest because they ran out of hot water... Yes that's right. No new guest at 7:45 because they ran out of HOT WATER. That's how we run restaurants these days I guess. Denying customers because of lack of hot water"}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for the two for $20 and honestly it wasn't even worth that. When we ordered they were out of all but one of their soups at 6:00pm on a weekday. Ok- well interesting but not that big a deal. Then we waited for 40 mins. for us to get our food and when it finally arrived the steak I ordered as a medium came out as a well-done piece of grey inedible leather. Of course I had to wait for them to re-make one, but luckily they brought the appetizer that should have been brought out first at the same time as the steak- that way at least I could fill up on mediocre boneless chicken wings and be full by the time my actual meal was brought out. No they did not offer me a free dessert, but the manager gave me a $5 coupon off my next visit. I asked to use it right then because I'm not sure when if ever I'll be back. The waitress was nice and apologized, but the truth is I've never been impressed with the less than mediocre bar food from this chain."}
{"text":"Service was atrocious!!!  Not expecting fine dinning service here, but at Least 1-3 check-ups throughout the experience. We were a party of 4 ( 2 adults and 2 children). The server completely ignored us the entire time. She even had a back up ( person in training) I suppose, that ignored us too.  Our drinks came out quickly but that was it. We ordered chips and salsa to start (when placing our drink orders). Had to ask 3 times when the chips were coming. After they were delivered we never saw our waitress (*ailey) Again!!!  Runner brought out  our food and refilled drinks. This was the WORST experience we have ever had at this establishment. Honestly, the rudeness of the staff and nonchalant attitude of the server makes me think I will keep my $75 and spend it somewhere else. A local business deserves my money more than this chain!  As far as their new burritos, save yourself time and a stomach ache. If you want a burrito, jump in line next-door at chipotle and get yourself a burrito!!!"}
{"text":"Dam shame, everyone feels like they have to price gouge you at the airport. $7 for a draft beer! Ridiculous."}
{"text":"We love calling ahead of time to order our food for pickup. They are always on time and our food is always correct. We also love dining in. The staff is always very accommodating."}
{"text":"A friend and I recently enjoyed an excellent meal at this establishment. The service was speedy and polite and the side of asparagus and tomatoes was especially delightful."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service. We arrived at 540ish pm they sat us immediately and it took someone till almost 6pm to take our drink order, then they took our food order at that time as well. During our wait for our food another table had been seated by us they got their order taken the money they were seated , it is now 630pm we still have no food but the table that got seated after us got their food, we are now at 645 they bring our food after a good 45 min after we ordered ALL of our food was cold, took us another 10 minutes to get someone's attention to complain(and it was the manager who brought the food out and he could barely speak English) told our waitress about the food being cold and her response was AWESOME and she said to us that she was being sarcastic because obviously this is a continuous issue. She grabbed the manager  and his response was we will discount your order and remake it really just a discount it's been now over hour we've been there and just a discount, and then I pointed out that the table that sat after us received their food way before us and their response was they only had 2 food orders and I said excuse me that shouldn't matter and we had only 3 food orders. Oh have I mentioned we had our 2 year old grand daughter with us and she was done waiting. We walked out and will never return to this location, I have never experienced this kind of wait let alone the rudeness from a manager before. And it barely was busy there was not even a wait to be seated."}
{"text":"We went to the Chili's on North Decatur and the 215 on Jan 14th around 430.  It was the worst service that I have ever experienced as no one ever came to our table to acknowledge my family of seven patronage even though we sat there for a minimum of 20 minutes (I checked my phone at the last message that I saw before walking inside the restaurant) without even our drink order being taken.  Nothing, nada....we didn't exist.  The staff walked past us numerous times and as it was my mother's birthday, and this was the restaurant she wanted to go to, we sat there and watched the waiter help the table in front of us and behind us but never acknowledged our presence.  It was the last straw when we saw 3 waitstaff place water glasses on a table of a party of about 20 that hadn't even arrived yet right next to our table while we were still in want.  We got up from our table and walked out of the restaurant without having ever been acknowledged by any of the Chili's staff.  I have seen other reviews here and almost figured why bother but this outing was highly disappointing and I hope that management sees what kind of workers are under their employ that they have the ability to totally ignore their customers.  This was a disgrace.  The service that is received at a restaurant is just as important as the food that is served, but unfortunately we don't have anything to report as far as the culinary experience."}
{"text":"Much improved     This has been my go to place for years,  Not anymore.... customer service is not a priority, the manager is rude!  and the food is less than expected.  Please fix it! I love chilis :((("}
{"text":"We've lived next to this Chili's for as long as it has been here and never bothered to eat there.   Decided to take advantage of the \"curb side carry out\" service they offer.   I ordered online for my mother and I. I gave my car's description.  Arrived 5 minutes earlier than the estimated order completion time. I parked in the Chili's togo spot and waited.   And waited.  I finally got out of my car and went into the togo door where my food was waiting for me.   The waitress politely explained that I was supposed to phone them when I got there. Oh well no biggy as long as the food is good right?  YECH.  My Nachos laid flat and soggy in the bottom of the togo container.  My mothers sour cream chicken enchaladas were also uninspired and had a \"funky\" taste to them.  The smell inside Chili's smelled like a dumpster about to get real nasty in the Arizona sun.   First and last time eating here.  I'll drive the extra mile to that other place a mile north on Mcdowell instead if I want  good Mexican food."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went on Tues. evening. We didn't wait long to be seated. Our waitress was spectacular. She was on top of everything. She refilled our drinks when they were empty, asked us if everything was alright and if we needed anything throughout our meal, she was great! We got the 2 for deal, our appetizer came out quickly and it was very good. Our meals came within a timely manner and they were very good. I must admit I was hesitant, since I had read reviews and there were some not so great ones, I came to this one even though the strip location was closer because of the reviews at that location. I would definitely go back again to this location."}
{"text":"Came for lunch sat at bar it was full of old drinks and food and the bartender did not clean until we asked multiple times... We waited 10 minutes just to order our food and drinks he didn't know what was on the wine list he didn't know what came with what it's kind of sad. They only cleaned near us still have plates and drinks sitting on bar (25 min later) smh I won't b returning to this chillis again"}
{"text":"I got what you expect from Chili's. Never great food but always good food. Its consistent. When you are traveling you can go to Chili's and always know what to expect. I realy like the chips and salsa though.   My daughter always gets the kids cheese pizza. It looks disgusting but she loves it. I talked to the waiter and he said its the best seller on the kids menu. I guess they know their market.   Had chicken fajitas on the two for 20 menu. It was good but the chicken was a little bland. I guess what you would expect from a chain trying to satisfy all tastes all over the US."}
{"text":"Third time I came to this location and no one came to our table. We sat and waited 15min. 6 people walked by our table and didn't say anything. Never eating at Chilies again. Poor service every time."}
{"text":"Prime rib burrito was good but a little too much chili. Ambiance great. Sat outside with the view of the Strip. Good service althiugh we came at a slow time."}
{"text":"Great service my sides were cold but main dish (steak) was hot which was weird but overall great evening....will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Well it was okay today, wait staff was prompt food can out quickly a definite bonus. Chips and Salsa always good, burger left something to be desired might of just been the particular type I ordered though. Wife enjoyed her quesadilla salad her normal stand by. So okay dinning experience no real complaints but nothing over the top."}
{"text":"Ordered my lunch today for 2 adults and 2 kids. All the food was cold and didn't arive for 40 minutes. The wife sandwich which was supposed to be a cool sandwich had melted cheese and dried out bread fromt sitting under the warming lamp too long. My salad had cold fried chicken on it, and the kids mac 'n cheese was below room temperature. The only thing good there was the soda which is hard to screw up. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service, little to no wait time. Try the El Niño margarita, delicious!"}
{"text":"Came to have a late dinner and all the food was nasty and old. The French fries tasted old as if they were just warmed up. We came more than an hour before closing and it still was bad. I ordered a soup and it wasn't even warm I asked to have it warmed and they added more cheese on top that it didn't even taste or look like soup all it was and tasted like was a glob of cheese! Definitely never going back. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Terrible food. My wife and I never go out and the time we did it was bad. It took them 45 minutes to bring our food out. It's not busy and nobody is here. When they brought the food out my son's Frys weren't even warm. We had to ask them for more water; we were out of water for a good 20 minutes while waiting for our food. The salmon my wife ordered was burnt, NOT seared. The manager tried defending the cooks. Then after my wife gave him back the plate they still wanted to charge us 1/2. I told him we don't care about the discount but more of is team serving better food. The steak on the fajitas was over cooked, the shrimp had no flavor. Super disappointed because we love Chili's. And because of this we will no longer be customers."}
{"text":"I give this location two stars, because the staff is very nice. I had a bug in my margarita. Ew.  Cleanliness seems to be an issue here.  The restrooms are right next to the kitchen entrance, which provides a lovely view of what's happenin' in them thar secret places. We dined at 9 at night, long after the dinner rush and the restaurant was not busy at all.  By the looks of the prep areas I spied, they don't clean up as they go. The reaturant itself had ample wait staff, but the tables were littered with napkins and rags. I won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Chili's, good 'ole Chili's.   I had been craving chips and queso from Chili's for MONTHS! We were gifted a $25 Chili's Gift Card and so FINALLY my craving would be fulfilled!  Friday night, 7 pm, busy restaurant but table of 4 was seated right away. Quick but unfriendly service. I admit we were indecisive, but you don't have to roll your eyes at us. Twice. I've been a server and bartender so I understand how indecisiveness can be annoying, but say \"you guys look like you could use more time, I'll come back in 2.\"  Any-whoo. We had our chips and queso, AND both couples did the 2-for-$20 deal so we also had loaded fries and cheese sticks. Oh, did I mention it was Friday, all food from Friday at 5pm to Sunday at midnight is calorie free! YAY!   Husband had the burger and I had the quesadilla explosion salad. No shortage of food at this table! 2 hours and 2 margaritas each and we needed a forklift to get us to the car. It has been years since I visited Chili's and this trip did not disappoint.   Only gave it 3 starts because the ice-margarita-size of glass ratio was wack (coming from a former Mexican restaurant bartender), moody server and because it's a chain restaurant..come on, a chain should never get 5 stars unless they don't use frozen ingredients and have original recipes at each location and a chef...not just a cook. JMHO.  I will come back to Chili's and this is a great location."}
{"text":"Chili's was outstanding tonight. I am especially pleased because the service at Longhorns horrible.  Chili's was packed and the service was excellent. Kristi was excellent!"}
{"text":"Food fine, service terrible. The restaurant was not busy but waitress sullen, bordering on rude and upset for some reason. She evidently had trouble with another table as somebody else handled their check & she loudly stated she was not going to clean it. She then waited on us, brought drinks wrong, never offered refills, and we had to beg for check. Not the first time I have had trouble with poor service. Again food fine & I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Service here is terrible!!! 20 minutes to get our drinks, longer for our food. Fajitas less than desirable. Server thinks he's a comedian with poor jokes and inappropriate comments (\"brought you enough napkins to clean up a murder scene\"). Stopped coming her over a year ago because of the service but thought we would give it a try again. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Sat for 20 minutes --no service. Finally just left.  I fly out of Calgary all the time. This is the norm but I thought I would give it a shot again.  Never again"}
{"text":"Bland rubber chicken & waiter with septum ring... Gross. Nothing grosser then something that looks like buggers hanging out your nose."}
{"text":"Great food as always had the buffalo boneless chicken salad, very tasty. Chili's is always a good place to come to if you get home sick."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is pretty quick and the Oreo dessert is to die for!!!!!! Great Friday night dinner place with the family.  I am a lifetime fan of chilis and I'm glad there's one close to my house with not much of a wait time. No so like the triple dipper with the boneless buffalo wings.  Delicious!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were at this Chili's about six months ago and our server was aloof and essentially ignored us. When he saw that I indicated zero for a tip on the check he gave me a nasty look. Since no manager was in visual range I elected to voice my concerns online. Today we went back and the food and service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Stopes by after a day if shopping at the outlets with my fiancée. We had guacamole, salsa and chips for an appetizer which was good, not outstanding, but solidly good.  We both ordered some variation of the chicken enchiladas that came with rice and black beans. Both entrees were good. Served piping hot and tasty."}
{"text":"25 minutes after placing our order waitress said there was a large to go order and they were starting on ours. 20 minutes later our order comes and my burger was cold. Another 20 minutes and I get my burger and it wasn't cold but it wasn't hot either.  My wife was served a stale and cold cup of coffee. We went to Chili's at 20th St. and Camelback for years and loved the place, but now we're crossing Chili's off out list."}
{"text":"The service was okay, and the food was average at best. We ordered an appetizer which took at least 30 minutes to finally get to our table. I always order the fajitas and when it came, the cheese was dried out and tasted like fridge & the guacamole was brown like it had been sitting for a while. Not impressed. On top of that, our waiter stopped by the table once during the meal and that was because I went to her. Like I said, average at best. The location at 77th and Bell is so much better!"}
{"text":"Five Guys is a better choice. Food was just not good.  Last time I was there, it was not good.   Thought I would give it another try.  Not again.  So many other good  options in this price range."}
{"text":"If I never want to sit in a Chili's for 3 hours I won't go to this location anymore. Only 3 of us. 2 adults 1 preteen and he's very hungry boy who loves Chili's and knows exactly what he wants. The waiter was thought he know better what we should have and not in a helpful way. Our boy ordered his usual hot wings and when we asked if he wanted anything else the waiter butted in and said \"Oh, you'll have plenty to eat\" Well, he's old enough to know how much he can eat with no help from the staff. Then he told us we needed cocktails. Uh, no we wanted sodas/tea. He never noticed we only had 2 place settings even when we finally got our appetizer (messy) so we shared forks and napkins. I walked around trying to find some sugar for my iced tea and after I asked for some it was awhile until I got it. We then sat and watched 3 new tables order and get their meal while we waited. It seriously wasn't anymore busy for our waiter then the others. We finally received our meal and the waiter was surprised we asked if our son could have some silverware/napkins with his meal. it barely made it on our table as he flew past with it. Our drinks were empty before we got our meal (HUGE deal for me) but we eventually got refills. When done our son wanted his usual cheesecake. We had to nearly beg the waiter to let us order him dessert (he's 12) and then he was made to feel bad when the waiter just couldn't believe he didn't want the hot pan cookie/icream thing. He's had the darn thing before!  Then as we watched more tables come and go we finally got our check THEN waited for the guy to take the money. I had to actually make it super visible since he didn't get the hint when the tray sat at the edge of the table forever. Then he came over complaining about \"Women\"! and something about seeing the movie \"The Hobbit\" as he then went on to tell us he owed us $.70  Hello, I'm a woman and I want to see the movie!  I would have paid $7.70 to get the heck out of there.  Went in the bathroom and toilets were unflushed and the silk flowers had long term dust on them. ICK!  I do have to say the food was good though. Also hot so at least we got that part."}
{"text":"The only good thing was the waitress. She was attentive and quick. The food however... wow. Now I remember why I don't go to Chilis. For some reason the chicken on my bacon ranch quesadillas was like a brown gray color? I thought chicken was white? Anyhow, the nachos and salsa were ok except for the fact that a few of them were so greased up they stuck together. Don't go here unless you're about to die of starvation."}
{"text":"Very Good  Ask For The Combo The steak and salmon with  mash  potatoes  and brocoli and garlic toast"}
{"text":"Ordered online from Noblesville IN location. First of all Applebee's brings your order to your car. Chili's does not. I arrived and my order wasn't even ready. After waiting several minutes the girl at the pick up desk finally found my order.   After getting home I discovered the grilled chicken salad didn't have any dressing.   I regret giving a tip. Will not go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Two stars cause the food was ok; customer service was awful. The place wasn't half full and the waiters didn't tend to us; we had to ask for the check 4 to 5 times before getting it. I'm a highly unsatisfied customer and don't recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"We didn't want to wait to be seated so we opted to go into the To-Go Area. There was 5 of us total and our experience was completely amazing due to KIANNA'S Service. She was so friendly and accommodating to us & even gave us complimentary drinks plus refills as we were waiting. She displayed great customer service & great attitude! She deserved all the tips she can get because she was that great to us! We would like to thank you for making our experience great & having a great time while waiting! :) Kianna your the best!   Thank you & best wishes, Your Friends:  The Cal State Fullerton Women's Lacrosse Team"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Chili's in a while, so I forget how mediocre the food is. It should be passable. The food is ok, nothing spectacular, but I did enjoy the chocolate lava cake.  The food was ok, it came out hot and edible, but the service really sucked. No happy hour on the weekends, and by the looks of it, they shoulld change that policy, the place was pretty empty. Again, the service sucked, a margherita flatbread was ordered and when it came the waitress angled the plate so that the flatbread slid off the plate when it was placed on the table. All we got was an oops, not a let me replace that for you or even a sorry."}
{"text":"I LOVE the skillet queso at Chilli's, but however, that seems to be one of the minimal things I like.   I have tried lots of things and cannot seem to enjoy them. Their chicken cesar salad sucks! It was really gross to me. The chicken was good, but it was that sauce they used. Totally not cesar to me.   I have had the buffalo salad, too much sauce, not enough chicken.   The burgers are probably my safety net.   This location is good for me though. They are always nice and sometimes funny. I have never waited long at all.   Sangria's there are OK. I like their mojitos better, but I wish they made better Sangria's because that is my drink! :)   Good place, good drinks, but dont be surprised if you do not like your meal."}
{"text":"Every once in a while I get snookered into going to a chain restaurant like this and though I go with an open mind, I am frequently disappointed.  This was the case at Chili's S. Las Vegas Blvd. It took forever for the waiter to take our order. It took forever for the food to come. My fajitas were not sizzling when brought to the table and warm One person at our table never got their soup The manager came by shortly after the food arrived and asked how everything was and I told him, he said \"sorry to hear that\" and kept walking.  WTF? If you find yourself driving by and you're hungry......keep driving."}
{"text":"I don't know why people complain about the service, our service was great. Probably because the place was nearly empty. I will say the food was a little above average. No one here for Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"Callerd ahead to reserve a table, was seated within 5 minutes after we arrived. Ribs, burger, chips all good and excellent service by Diane! :) refills kept coming, didn't even have to ask for an extra plate, let us try the ranch dressing for the chips (instead of the usual salsa) for free.  And they sang happy birthday with a scoop of ice cream for my dtr.  Paid at the table with the kiosk on the table.loveit!  Bella's blurp..\" food is good, and service is the best ever. Favorite waitress. Diane!\""}
{"text":"So I decided to try Chili's to go. Big mistake I never write reviews ... I'm very busy with 2 jobs, but I just had to . I ordered quesadilla explosion salad not too difficult.. the serverv brings out my bag folded under  so I figured my food was right ,  I'm in a rush to go I had to wait 15 minutes for it to come... I got home open up my bag and see there's no quesadillas on the salad ... I call chili's management was very rude she said cheese flaps as she called them were only worth a  1.99 and I'm not making you another salad for a 1. 99 worth of food and also I don't have access to any vouchers to send and she hung up on me and would not answer the phone again.... Stay clear of this place they do not remedy their mistakes..  I will not be going back at this location Jan 20th 2014 11 p.m. Management was rude 855 Freeport road waterworks mall... If you do go order in so that they can remedy before you pay..."}
{"text":"If I could give this location 0 stars I would! Worst service ever! It took 20 minutes for us to even get drinks....which were soda and water. The servers standing around talking and they weren't that busy. If you are thinking of choosing this Chili's...I would suggest going somewhere else! I will never come here again"}
{"text":"I am pleasantly surprised that every time I go to this chili's location there is almost always no wait times. The staff is very energetic & willing to accompany all needs! I love this chain of restaurants but this location is by far my favorite. I go quite often & have yet to experience a bad time. The 2 for $20 deal is just the right amount of food for a really good price. Although my favorite meal is definitely the margarita chicken bowl! 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. First they bring the complete opposite of what we ordered, the chicken fingers for my daughter had hairs cooked into them, and I accidentally forgot my sunglasses sitting on the table we called to find them and of course no one turned them in and allowed their own employees to take for themselves. If you want to be treated like shit make sure you go here."}
{"text":"A typical day out to lunch with my girlfriend turned out to be a embarrassing experience I'll never forget. We started out with water and chips and queso. Now we were extremely hungry so we wanted something quick. Now when our waitress came back we put in an order for another appetizer which was the triple Dipper. Now time went by and our triple Dipper was delivered and yet she never asked if we were ready to order. No big deal. I then proceeded to call her over so that we could order soft drinks and again she never asked if we were ready to order. Again no big deal. So again I called her over to tell her we were ready to order and she looked confused and said \"oh well what can I get you\" well my friend and I wanted to share our plates and we were looking forward to an afternoon of gorging out and enjoying each other's company. So as she proceeded to go on with ordering the three meat deal that y'all had which consisted of the ribs smoked sausage and Crispers. When she was done she proceeded to tell me to go ahead and order and our rude waitress decides to stop us  right there and tell us very loudly  that \"that was a lot of food\" she proceeded to tell us \"she'll give us what ever we want\" but, \"I'm just saying that's a lot of food\" how embarrassing is it for your server to make you feel embarrassed about what you want to order. We decided to get up and leave right at that moment we offered to pay our bill and spoke with the manager and he told us not even to worry about our bill and just to go ahead and walk out and then he apologized for what had happened. I will never step foot in that Chili's again. I have never felt so humiliated in my entire life time and I was at that very moment."}
{"text":"Chili's Bar and Grill, many say just another chain restaurant forced to cut 40% of it's menu, I say a Diamond in the rough focusing on what it does best.  Tell me another place where you are guaranteed what I refer to as the 3 Qs. Quality, Quantity, and Quickness.  I stopped in today around 11:15 with a friend looking to catch up, and have a nice meal.  Once again Chili's delivered.  We were greeting cordially, and seated at the bar.  As soon as we sat we were greeted with a grin from ear to ear from our wonderful bartender Samantha, and our drinks were made in two shakes of a lambs tail. With a menu the size of the latest New Yorker Magazine, you might as well play pin the tail on the donkey to decide what will fill your tummy joy.   Salads, soups, steaks, they've got it all.  All are made with the type of love you would hope someone would show while caring for their first born.   Chili's always comes through in the clutch, and that's why I will never turn my back on them.  They make you feel like part of the family, and it today's America, that's really all we can ask for."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Clearly a management problem here at the Concord location. Our waitress(Jennifer) was very apologetic and worked hard in trying to make the best of what's a poorly managed restaurant. I actually left her a larger than normal tip because I felt so bad for the lack of support she received from management and the kitchen. I rarely leave negative reviews for my experiences, but I felt the need because this location can't even be close to a good experience. Dust all over the wall dividers between the booths, deathly slow service, no paper towels in men's room, and I received my salad after my entree. Shame on Chili's for taking money for this experience."}
{"text":"I was starving after a long day of travel so I sat in the lounge to grab a quick meal and a beer. Kathy was a rockstar! She is a fantastic server/bartender and was on top of everything.  My food came out super quickly and was delicious."}
{"text":"Ok, so this is my second review of this location. We again went to sit in the bar area because we didn't want to wait for regular seating, we probably should have. At first, it seemed like service would be good in the bar area. They quickly cleared the table we wanted and then the waiter got us our non-alcoholic drinks and took our order which was a simple appetizer for dinner for my wife and two side dishes for my dinner. He then proceeded to go to the next table to get their order before placing ours. No big deal seen it before but over heard the next table ordering full entrees for dinner. We then proceeded to wait almost a full hour before I lost my patience and asked for the manager when the table next to us got their food and ours was nowhere to be seen and the waiter had not stopped by to check on us or give us any kind of apology for the delay. When the manager showed up I told him we were leaving and not paying for anything just as our simple order finally showed to the table. He tried to apologize and COMP our meal but I didn't want it due to this being the second time the service by the bar area staff had fallen. I told him that this was the second time in a row to this location and that the bar staff was horrible. WE WILL NOT BE BACK TO THIS LOCATION NO MATTER WHAT! The location on McKellips and Power is much better!"}
{"text":"Went there on. Friday evening, not too late or early so wasn't slammed crazy but still busy. We sat at a table in the bar area. The waiter was not very concerned about his service. When my daughter got her margarita, she said it had no alcohol in it. When we mentioned it to the server, he said \"that's the way it's made\", no effort to replace and make us happy! Nothing! Then when it came time to clear the plates, instead of saying excuse the reach or anything, he just reached and grabbed plates and was kind of rude! Not sure we will be back. Also, my wife's food had no flavor and not worth what we paid for it."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!  some prices are a little steep depending on what you order.  Restaurant is always clean and orderly and servers are very attentive."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this restaurant. I love the food and atmosphere. They always are fast with the tables and there food is great. My favorite combo to get here is a milkshake and chicken crispers. There desserts are to die for and I always have a positive experience when I'm here."}
{"text":"My family loves Chili's. The food is always fabulous and the service is great. The employees are always friendly and eager to serve the customers. It is always a delicious experience for our taste buds when"}
{"text":"The night before my family had to leave, we took them this place awesome restaurant. I had eaten at a different location and thought the food was awesome. So I decided to them to this place since I had a $100 gift card from work for Chili's. When we walked in, we were greeted right away. We had to wait to be seated since there was 10 of us, but it didn't take too long before we were able to sit and order our drinks. Around the table we all ordered teas and sodas; from sprites, Dr peppers to raspberry teas. The waiter was a nice guy that brought our drinks right away along with a couple of baskets of chips and spicy salsas. Afterwards,  he took our orders. They still had the 2 for $20 specials with an appetizer. So far starters, my sister ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta and I had the Crispy Chicken Crispers that was flavored with Honey-Chipolte sauce. For our appetizer, we had the half order ofTexas Cheese Fries. For her boys, they ordered off the kids menu. One had a personal pan pizza and the other had chicken fingers. My son had the Shriner Bock BBQ Burger with fries. My parents had the 2 for $20 deal. My mom had the Margarita Grilled Chicken and my dad had the Half Rack Baby Back Ribs with fries. For their appetizer, they had fried cheese. And lastly my brother and his girl had the 2 for $20 deal also. My brother had the Crispy Chicken Crisper - Original flavor and his girl had the Half Rack Baby Back Ribs with Fries. Their appetizer was fried cheese. The bill came out to $103 and suggested a 18% gratuity be paid. So, since all agreed that the service was great, we paid the 18%, which brought the bill to $120 and some change. I rounded the payment off to $121. We had such a great time dining, laughing, spending quality time since it was the last night together and their flight was at 7am."}
{"text":"Gina was such an amazing server, never in my life have i been so lucky to see such a graceful/elegant waitress. Her beauty is beyond words. I was so hungry and thought Chilis served teriyaki chicken but i was wrong so i got really frustrated but luckily i had gina to help me find another option. I ended up getting fried cauliflower and it was amazing. my friend kiley that i always dine with is really afraid of loud noises but luckily ginas sweet and soothing voice calmed her down."}
{"text":"Ridiculous service... Been waiting for an hour now for our lunch... These guys expect us to wait for over an hour on a work day"}
{"text":"Who are you kidding, we all know that you've scarfed their awesome blossom, beer battered and deep fried chicken fingers, Grilled steak fahita, etc...  Typical american chain, drags you in with the promise of carefully crafted grease ladden dishes and you leave feeling bloated, fat and the need to run to the toilet.  But you still go back, because those chicken fingers are so good."}
{"text":"I used to like Chili's, but they (along with Applebees, Ruby Tuesday's, and TGiF), have gone down hill. Service wasnt all that bad, but the food was. Ordered the Monterrey chicken, and out came this slop of cheese and bacon over a sad piece of chicken. My gf ordered the Margarita chicken, and it was swimming in what looked like leftover margarita mix. Do yourself a favor and goto On the Border next door, or Moe's across the street."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken strips, a burger, Texas fries and egg rolls to go. The entire order was no warmer than room temperature, the chicken was tough, and the Texas fries looked like they were made yesterday. Seems like someone's leftovers were sold in attempt to make a profit."}
{"text":"i know its a fast food chain restaurant, but normally the food is pretty decent but when i went to this one, service was very slow and the food was so so. I do not think i will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"The food was hot and tasty.  Service prompt and cheerful, was a good dining experience tonight."}
{"text":"Just for anyone who thought they liked Chilis...AVOID this one. Not only did they serve moldy cheese with our meal but the manager down played the situation by making it seem like it was pepper jack cheese. Then why was it only on a couple pieces! I know mold buddy! He also winked at me and told me if there was anything else to just ask. He did not try to compensate us and we lost our appetites! Terrible management style by making the customer feel stupid and condescending attitude toward women. I love Chilis but will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"I was in yesterday 1/30/2018. Was expecting a typical Chili's experience and was sort of disappointed.  First - The good  1. The hostess was excellent. Funny and made me feel welcome. 2. The Waitress was very good and friendly. 3. I think the manager came by as well and was nice too.  4. The plain Ice Tea was very good.   Second - The not so good  1. Clearly understaffed for the shift.  2. Slow food preparation.  3. Overly Salty and greasy even for a Chili's  I think this location needs more staff at lunch for both the kitchen and the dining/bar area. It could possibly be excellent for dinner, but I dont live in the area and wont likely be going back for lunch as there are a lot of choices in the area.  Thank you for the opportunity to voice my thoughts and hope this helps."}
{"text":"The hostess was sweet and cleaned a booth in the bar for us, but the seats weren't wiped down and the table was still wet when we were seated at it, which is a pet peeve of mine. Then I ordered a grey goose with soda and lime and got a goose on the rocks. When it was pointed out to the bar tender, he 'fixed' it by dumping it over a pint glass full of ice. That is still the wrong drink, fool. The final straw was that I didnt get my side of mayo the first time I asked for it. Then when I asked again, there was no acknowledgement that I had even asked for it to begin with. I know, at least I didn't have to cook dinner myself, but even I would have gotten my drink right the second time. Good fries though."}
{"text":"Chili's has always been a favorite of mine.  They went thru a low period a little while back but the quality and friendliness of their employees is coming back strongly.    We had a 2 for $22 meal that includes an app or salads and full meals.  This is a good deal.  With their large portions (even larger than the Chili's in Summerlin area) you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We were there last night our waitress was very nice, but seemed as if she was to busy. Our food took more than 40 min to get to our table. Each round of drinks to 15 min to get to our table. It's not like we ordered something that took a long to cook."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Everything we tried was fresh and tasty! The staff was very friendly and the ambiance was as expected for a chain! We tried it takeout as well,and it traveled well! Delicious!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for sub-par food, go to Chili's. We were seated quickly but the menu options were really deceptive. I ordered a fajita platter and it was made very sloppily.. It looked NOTHING like the menu photos. Not only that but when we got our food, we had no silverware and our waiter was nowhere to be found... It took us nearly 10 minutes to actually be able to eat our food. I also never got sides with my food.. And had to complain about that too. Our server was such a nice guy but this experience overall was crap. Chili's: you have disappointed me today."}
{"text":"Was waited on from one of the best servers and the food was preety good!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and the place was just ok. I did not like the burger I ordered. My wife's salad was good. We ordered the chips and salsa for an app and its bottomless so that is nice. Not sure we will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The burger was great. Fries where 1/2 cold and not looking like the promo picture.    Love the strip view from here. That's awsome.  Our waitress was very pleasant and made our visit .."}
{"text":"This was the best burger I've had.  Awesome service and price is very low for meals. Clean and for family meals this was a great place ."}
{"text":"I haven't been to chilis in a LONG time but always loved it! Unfortunately,  I was severely disappointed in the food on my recent visit with some friends.  I had two margaritas (which were pretty much all ice and I had to ask for more salt because there was practically nothing on the rim) and I got a bacon cheeseburger.   The bacon cheeseburger looked great but had absolutely no flavor and was kind of tough,  this was very sad to me as they used to have one of my favorite burgers!  We also got tableside guacamole and that was ok.  The saving grace was our server who was so sweet,  patient,  and awesome!  I am not planning on returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"We come to Chilis often and usually enjoy ourselves, but this time it was not that great of an experience.  We sat at the bar tables and the place was moderately busy for lunch.  The waitress came to us and got our drink order, but you could tell she was handling numerous tables.  She came back about 10 minutes later and we ordered, mostly the soup and salad special with comes with chips and salsa.  About 20 minutes later we asked about the chips and she apologized and got them for us.  Our food came out about 20 minutes later.  The enchiladas had been sitting under a heat lamp way too long and even though I requested no beans, it was on the plate and dried out.  The food was was ok, but it wasn't their typical quality we have come to love.   The manager did tell other tables that they had a bunch of sick calls that day, so they were swamped.  I feel for the server, she was earning her pay today.  If you walk in and see a lot of tables waiting to be bussed and a busy waiting area, don't wait and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Order the Steak+Grill shrimp combination plate. Server was pleasant. Food was meh. Steak was borderline rare. Requested Medium. Slight burnt on the outside...but borderline rare on the inside? How is that even possible. French Fries soggy...not crisp. Shrimp was acceptable Presentation:Acceptable. I've had better at other Chili;s Restaurant.  Would I return? Probably not this particular restaurant"}
{"text":"Busy Friday night, got seated right away. Our waitress was very polite. Food was out fast and hot. Very good as always. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The chicken flatbread pizza was awesome. Had a great dinning experience. I will be back,"}
{"text":"Total crap, waited 20 minutes with 11  open tables then after 22 minutes waited 5 minutes with manager walking by 2 times and then only 2 menus for 4 one Spanish one English for our first greeting. Then we only get 2 sets of silverware cause \" have to find more around here\"  Nathan Gearhart, manager should not be working anywhere that is service industry until his  graduation into non fast food. If you have kitchen staffing issues you come out and tell the waiting patrons. Not run around trying to put out existing fires exclusively because the same issue will arise once the waiting are seated. Totally disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here after a horrible experience at a neighboring restaurant. In the time that it took us to leave the other place (after not being attended to with even a hello at the table after 15 minutes), we already had our order in and appetizer on the table at Chili's. Our waitress Danielle was friendly, helpful, and professional. We ordered fajitas and Cajun pasta and everything tasted amazing. I'm so glad we ended up here."}
{"text":"Everything was very good, I had the Buffalo boneless wings and that were HOT, at first I thought it was a little pricey, but they they were on point sauced very well and we're delicious, For a Drink I had there new tito's punch it was good. But I was by myself and the waitresses were very polite and nice! Overall I tell everyone to come back to chili's it's very good!"}
{"text":"I love the food chili's is chili's but there is this waitress and she is just amazing! Her name is Niki, every time I come in she knows what I want to drink and exactly what food I want and the exclusions I get."}
{"text":"Because this is so close to our house we have been here a few times. We keep given it chances but alway are reminded why we should never return. Service is underwhelming and very slow. Food is mediocre.. Maybe new management would help? Also, if your child plays with the table side iPad device, plan on paying a fee of $1.99 for that."}
{"text":"My recent visit to Chili's was the first time in years.  A friend had a gift card to burn so she took a few people there.  I think my taste buds have grown a bit more sophisticated because I found my chicken bacon ranch quesadilla to be quite bland and salty.  The service was fine, but the food was not.  I was reminded why I usually didn't go to large chain restaurants.  There are some decent, even good ones, but Chili's is not one of them.  I could have made a better quesadilla at home."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Chili's in a long time but decided to go there instead of Applebee's. Unfortunately, we found a hair in the fries my friend ordered. We told the waitress who apologized and she got us another order of fries. When she came around, she asked how everything was going and we were honest in reporting to her that we'd lost our appetites after the hair and felt the need to check all our food out of fear for other hairs. She said nothing and left. (She never returned to our table after this; we tipped her anyway).   A manager then comes and asks us how we are doing. We tell him that we were quite upset with the found hair. He apologized and said that he's not sure how this happened as they take precautions, but it does happen occasionally. He shrugged and said matter-of-factly \"Mistakes happen.\" Seriously?! He gave us all the impression that hair in Chili's food happens and when it does, they don't feel it's a big deal.   Me and my friends looked at each other, aghast at his response and attitude. He gave us a 10% discount off the bill. Wow, how generous. I'm in management and know that the best way to win over a customer is a serious apology and atonement (for example, \"I'm so sorry. In no way is this acceptable and I apologize. Let me try and make it right so that you'll give us another chance.\"). Instead, we got a lousy 4$ off our meal."}
{"text":"Awful place to go for dinner!!! Slow service. The waiters act like they have never been in a restaurant before."}
{"text":"This place is great!   We moved to Surprise from Goodyear,  even though we miss our Goodyear Chili's we love this one now too.   Joanne & Danielle are great.   No matter what server we get they are good though. Sign up for email club,  they always give free stuff"}
{"text":"Worst service experience! Don't waste your money at this location. As we arrived there was no one to greet us at the front. Then the hostess finally ran up front and offered us self seating in the \"lounge\" (Bar) area. We were fine with that except three of the available tables were dirty! We stood there looking around for someone to clean a table for us. I went back to the front to ask the hostess for assistance but she was missing again. As I went back into the lounge area my husband was already asking the female bartender if someone could clean a table for us? She replied rudely with \"Someone will be there in a min!\" Me and my husband looked around to see who she was talking about because nobody was on the way to clean it. We stood there for at least 3 full minutes watching employees talking near the computers and walking around doing much of nothing. Finally a server came out with food for her table and offered to clean the table for us. I noticed the bartender was just talking with with her customer not really doing anything important so I don't understand why she couldn't have cleaned the table for us. Anyway we ordered our drinks and they brought us our margaritas without the shakers? Like what is happening here? That's when the server and bartender tells us that they don't serve Patron presidentaes in the shakers (Which is how we get them everywhere else) because according to them they will leak everywhere!  Then one of the them tells us \"Well that's not what you ordered.\"  So now it's our fault? Look we know what we ordered and this staff is full of excuses! Not to mention that we never seen a manager ANYWHERE while we were here. At that point we just canceled our orders and left! We will continue to go to the Chandler location instead! Where the cleanliness and service is by far better!"}
{"text":"Our server was good however the Steak knives were disgusting! Silverware should never be given to guest with highly visible RUST and Corrosion build-up caked on the utensils that Me and my family will eventually put in our mouths! This lack of attention to details will definitely keep me from returning!  Makes me wonder what's happening back in the kitchen!  Where's the Quality Assurance?"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but their service and manners were terrible. It took forever and there weren't busy. And the waitresses were rude"}
{"text":"The bartender Joclyn is awesome. She def, is on top of her game. She is very attentive to my needs and is hard worker. Mosely is a great mananger and definetly a leader at this location. I love both of their personalities and their warm greetings. I will continue to return for my Friday lunches at the bar."}
{"text":"The Five Stars shared herein are for the Bar area service, food and drinks. In that respective order.  The service is always great, even during Happy Hour, 5 - 7 PM. You can expect to enjoy some conversation and TV between visits from your server because it can be hectic for them. But, watch and observe how well they treat each customer.   If K.C. is on duty, prepare to have a very satisfactory experience. He is friendly, works non-stop, and mixes the best Presidenté margaritas!  The food is always perfectly seasoned, served hot and tastes delicious. If you haven't tried the Southwestern Eggrolls appetizer, well, you are certainly missing a treat!  Then, order the Pork Carnitas Tacos and prepare for bliss!  Let's not forget the drinks. Fantastic!  I visit weekly, for multiple good reasons."}
{"text":"This place is convenient but it's just not what is used to be. Went on a Tuesday and stood at the door waiting for someone to greet and seat us. It took about 10 min. As I looked around to see the place busy, it was not. The server was nice enough but the food just isn't as good as I remember. The food we all ordered was very bland and not to mention took foooorrrrrrever to come out, seriously it's not busy why did it take so long. Overall service was ok but food was not...so probably won't be back. :("}
{"text":"My husband and I got the 2 for 20. He always gets the chicken crispers and I the chicken cajun pasta. The pasta came to me super salty. I had my husband taste it in case my taste buds had gone crazy. He also agreed that it was way too salty. I told the server and she was really nice and took the food back. The manager came to our table and told me have I had it before because \"we always make it the same way\". Uhm, excuse me?! I then  proceeded to tell him I always order this meal and this is the first time it came to me salty. He then said \"well I guess we can put the cajun seasoning on the side. Maybe it was too much for you\" What kind of manager greets their customers this way? he was talking to me as if if I was crazy! It was ridiculous. They sent me a new plate and it wasn't the cajun seasoning it was the Alfredo sauce that was super salty. So I didn't eat it and they never brought my garlic bread either. We just payed the bill and took it home for my dog. We will NEVER go to this location again."}
{"text":"When we got there the hostess greeted us right away, when we get to the table it took the server 15 min to notice us and asked \" if we had been helped\"  when we had nothing on the table.... after taking our drink order we waited another 15 min with no drinks while he took care of his other tables, finally we decided to get up and leave....worst service ever will not come back to this location"}
{"text":"I always enjoy this chilis ... The 2 for 20 bucks includes so many items. The chips and salsa are always a must and currently they offer a bottomless soup and salad special which their soups are always really good. The wait staff is always on top of their game so I love it there!!"}
{"text":"Came here to have dinner with my family... not happy at all. My sons chicken dippers were hard and mandarin oranges were hot! Next my order was wrong when she brought it to me! Food took so long to get back my family was all done and my food was not brought yet!! She brings and it's still not right!! Had to return it again! Not coming back!"}
{"text":"This Chili's definitely needs a completely new manager, staff and chef.  Bad, Bad, Bad!!! Food was awful and the service was even worst.  I will not go to this Chili's for a long time.  Come on, get it together and do your job."}
{"text":"We ate here around 2pm today.  There was no greeter at the podium and we waited several minutes before seating.  Our server sat us so I guess they don't have a host/hostess this time of day.    I immediately noticed these tablets on tables that raced through advertisements.  There are ones on every table.  It made the background very busy and distracting, especially since they were not all on the same sequence.  These seem like an awful idea. This by itself would make me not come back but there were far more problems.  Our food was very slow to come out.  My wife's food was cold when it finally came out.  apparently they made it and let it sit there while they made fajitas, that were too oily. The quality of the chicken was quite poor too.  We would have complained, but our service was terrible and we never got checked on.  It was not really the server's fault. They only had one server on the floor for about 8 tables and he was also seating people.  As we sit there we are finished and the server comes over and asks if we want dessert. We say no. This means we want the check, right? Not here.  We wait another 10-15 minutes and notice the people at the table next to us are just as annoyed and discovered they could pay their bill on the tablet.  I wanted to pay cash though.  We could not flag anybody down.  We finally paid the bill on the tablet.  Bad food. Bad service. Stupid annoying tablets on every table flashing screens every few seconds. No way to pay cash for bill anymore apparently."}
{"text":"Love their food and their happy hour! Great variety, portions and prices"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Chili's in many, many years, and I haven't missed out. I wasn't impressed with this location. It wasn't very clean. The bathroom was dirty and hadn't been cleaned. After leaving the bathroom, I looked in the kitchen and saw an employee with pink hair leaning on the counter, twirling her hair and then texting. Then, I walked passed another worker who was sitting at a regular table stuffing utensils in these brown bags. I don't know if his hands were clean, but he was touching the part that you put in your mouth and putting them in the brown bags. The appetizers were lousy. The cheese curds were too salty, and I like salt. The crispy asparagus were so greasy that they weren't crispy and sat in a pool of grease...yuck. The fajitas weren't bad. However, I'm concerned about their sanitation and the fact that the employees, who weren't overly friendly, that I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Got wrangled into coming here for a business lunch.  I know it's Chile's, but you would think that a major national franchise would be able to produce uniformly bland food.  I got the sliders, which come in and order of four, and ended up with one totally unseasoned greasy mini-burger and three salt licks.  (So, great place for lunch if you're a deer . . .)  I appreciate that we took up the table for more than an hour during a busy lunch, but I used to be service industry, and would have tipped accordingly if our server hadn't been so obviously pushing as hard as she could to get us out of the table.    Ch-ch-ch-chile's!  Babyback Sucks!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff is nice and very interactive, and the food is delicious. Only thing you might gonna have to wait for a table and wait a little more for your food but regardless is worth it. If speed would increase by a little bit this place would get a 5 star. I recommend it."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a DISAPPOINTING dining experience at Chili's Grill & Bar in North Olmsted about a year-and-a-half ago. Hopefully, their service has improved since then as we haven't been back since.  She ordered a Buffalo Chicken Ranch Sandwich and asked them to hold the ranch dressing. It came with ranch dressing. The server said it would only be a few minutes to get a new sandwich. 7 minutes later, no sandwich. Got the manager involved. Just then the replacement sandwich arrived - but it was the WRONG chicken sandwich.  They offered to replace it. In the meantime, MY meal was getting cold. You think they would have taken my food back and brought out hot, fresh food so we could eat at the same time. The manager did not charge us for our meals, but the point is, we went out to have a nice, relaxed meal together - not get free, cold food that was half wrong.  This was the 2nd bad experience in a row at the N Olmsted location. It's really too bad because we enjoyed their food... when they got our orders right."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I have visited this location a few times for lunch and we have noticed each time the food is great, however, their food service is ssssllllooooowwwwww. They take forever to get your food. We ordered 2 sandwiches and 2 salads and it took 25 minutes to get the sandwiches (salads came fairly quickly). One was your typical club sandwich and the other was a grilled chicken sandwich. Simple enough. We sat in the bar area and there were 4-5 tables seated at any given time and 1 or 2 to-go orders coming in and out. Surveying the dining area just across the way there were another 4-ish tables seated in various stages of ordering, eating, waiting for the check. All in all, not very busy. Nonetheless, it takes forever to get food. Another table was complaining about the wait as well.If you don't have a lot of time for lunch, skip this place. If you aren't in any particular hurry, it is fine since the food is great and the service is good too. Maybe to go is the best option but I have not tried it yet."}
{"text":"Is what it is nothing special in the food department.  They used to have great Happy hour but that is no longer the case. However the staff always seems to be helpful and attentive. I would suggest getting the happy hour back to the way it was."}
{"text":"With my husband and two (very well behaved grandchildren) we had dinner last evening at Chili's Restaurant at 9051 W. Charleston, Las Vegas, Nv. At approximately 6:15.  There was one other occupied table on our side of the restaurant.   After 10 minute wait our server, Shannon, came to our table and took our drink order and walked away.  It was 15 minutes before our drinks arrived at our table at which time she took our dinner order.   The children ordered their meal and I explained that my husband and I would like to split an entree and a salad, as we wanted to eat light because we wanted to have dessert this evening.  With this Shannon rolled her eyes in disgust.  My granddaughter said \"wow\"! Noticing the rude gesture.  20 minutes later another person brought our dinners and my grandson received a different dish than what he ordered so we explained to him and he picked it up and left our table.  Taking a long time for him to receive his order he was eating off my plate as we had a busy day and the kids were hungry.  He received his order 15 minutes after the three of us were finished.  Our drinks were never filled, we were never asked if everything was okay.  Shannon came to the table one time and all she said was \"I guess the chef messed up your order\". We asked for our check and I told her \"I have a coupon\". She turned away rolling her eyes again and said \"I'm sure you do\" and we never saw her again.  My husband finally went to the bar tender and asked for our check.  They were not busy, we again were never asked for a refill, or if everything was okay, of what we wanted for dessert as we have previously explained that we did.  Being upset when I got home I called Ron, the Manager of the store to explain what happened and he said \"well, things happen\".   I was literally speechless of his response.  Did not receive a \"sorry\" from anyone from start to finish."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. The hightop on the bar was dirty and needed cleaning before we could sit-down. Our servers was very good and \"honest\" about different food selections. It's a hit and miss due to inconsistencies."}
{"text":"Waited 45 min. For food. The waiter came to the table 2 times in that 45 min.  Food was good. Just veey slow. And not busy."}
{"text":"Always get great service here with exceptional food!! And their margaritas are delicious. Their happy hour specials on food makes the bill not so scary when you get it!  All in all, a great place to have a girls night out or a family night."}
{"text":"Entered and encountered a less than pleasant host.  Was seated and given menus with old sauce and ketchup stuck to them. Top of table very sticky. Looked around at the floor and the dirt was months of build up. Was not just from that day. My daughter used the bathroom and was able to look back into the kitchen, complete filth. We decided to avoid the possible food poisoning and left before ordering. Would not eat at this Chili's."}
{"text":"do\"s and dont's Dont order online, Do check your order before you leave if you order online Dont bring cash tip, Do pay upfront 15% gratuity Do bring your humiliation or a witty debating attitude  Again..Do check your order Dont' sit in  your car and use their curbside delivery Do go in to get your order,  Dont call the store after you have an issue Dont ask for a manager he will hang up on you Do call corporate if you want any justice Dont expect fast service Do try because maybe its your lucky day, or they listen to yelp Dont go here, Do go to another Chilis Do go here if you just go to drink, the bar is probably good. Do expect the curb girls to have the manager wrapped around their finger Do smile because what other option do you have"}
{"text":"This just happened, they put bad lettuce on your hamburgers and when you complain about it they tell you that they'll bring you out a piece of lettuce."}
{"text":"Food was good. Our party got a chicken quesadilla, pork bowl, steak fajitas, the classic sirloin, and wings. All tasty. The service was ok. Our waitress was quick with the refills but not around for anything else. The resturant was very dirty. The tables weren't wiped down, the floors around the tables had obviously not been swept all night. There was a crazy amount of food all over the floor. The menus were even dirty, all of had menus that were sticky."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today, there wasn't a wait which I loved. My server Kim was prompt and got my drink order within just a few minutes of me sitting down.  I ordered the lunch special which included a bowl of soup and a double buyer with fries. My soup came out rather fast, but was hot and delicious,  so no complaints. Kim made sure my drink was refilled promptly as well... I was js about halfway done when she brought me over another(also letting me know my food was almost done)which came out js about 5 mins after. All in all, there's nothing spectacular about chili's food.. js like all the other chains. But it's was hot and good. This review was more so for the awesome service I received from Kim. A lot of places lack in customer service but she's awesome as long as she's here I'll continue to come back."}
{"text":"Holy moly moo cows, batman, what the heck? Beer was nearly flat, fries over seasoned to the point of being inedible (i tried wiping them off, wasn't worth the effort), I paid an extra dollar for the world's saddest three slices of avocado, I'm pretty sure the egg on my burger was microwaved or simply crafted from rubber, and it took right under 40 minutes from when I placed my order to when I received it. The server/bartender, Stan?, was nice, but too busy to be all that attentive. Additionally, the couple at the table beside me both ordered some sort of shrimp and chicken pasta. Neither one of them got the shrimp with their entree and had to wait for another 10 or so minutes to get it."}
{"text":"I have been to this location multiple times and every time the service is horrendous and the food is mediocre. Not sure if the location being in a mall has to do with it, but stay away unless you are really disparate for some grub."}
{"text":"We came into Vegas for a music festival and went here for lunch. We came in waiting for over 5 minutes until we were even greeted, let alone sat down. Our meals came, everything looked okay, however the flavor was a whole other story. One got chicken enchiladas and it was basically mush. One didn't get his food until after everyone finished eating. I got a Caribbean salad and the dressing seemed like it wasn't there, however once I started eating it all of the dressing was making the bottom lettuce soggy. After our meal, my boyfriend instantly threw up outside the restaurant from what they had served him."}
{"text":"My steak was grey and cold, my wife's plate was just as bad. The gentleman who helped us was pretty nice and kept checking up on us to make sure we were doing ok so no complains there but everything else was very disappointing. I will never go to this restaurant again and will def tell people to stay away. Its not to often I have the time to take my wife and children out due to work so the fact that I wasted our date night on a place like this really pisses me off. Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered food to go tonight for my family. It was 15 minutes late coming out, and when I got home, the order was completely screwed up: an appetizer was missing, a burger that was ordered as a black bean patty was meat and had no sides with it as ordered, and none of the requested sides of Ranch or blue cheese were there. Talk about incompetence."}
{"text":"Meh. Stopped in for dinner before heading to an appointment. Was by myself.  Ordered hot tea, they have only one kind - generic Tetley. OK, no big deal. I guess I was spoiled by Bob Evans and their selection of about a half-dozen teas.   Entrée was Cajun pasta with grilled chicken. Came with a piece of texas toast. The pasta was overdone, the sauce was watery alfredo, and the chicken - although moist - was bordering on soggy, and it was quite tasteless. I would not recommend that dish, especially if you've had it at North Park Lounge where they do it very well. I was actually surprised how all aspects of the dish, other than the chopped green onions on top, were sub-par.  Before the entree arrrived, the server asked if I wanted more tea, delivered another cup of hot water, then asked if I wanted another teabag. Um, yeah? And he had to go back to get it.  My server was friendly and polite but not particulary attentive. Did not see him from the time my entrée arrived until I was done eating.   Décor was nice and the place was clean.  Maybe some of their other meals are better, but I would skip the Cajun pasta."}
{"text":"I like this Chili's and have become a frequent diner there.  I know that some people do not like casual dining, chain food restaurants.  The positive for me is that the food is always consistent and always good.  I noticed that someone gave this place one-star and suggested going to the next-door O'Charley's instead.  That person must work for O'Charley's.  I have been to O'Charley's, and their service and food is below Chili's standards.  I would give this Chili's four stars.  Since I think the one star is so unfair, I will give five stars instead.  Service is always outstanding and friendly here.  One of the assistant managers, named Katrina, almost always stops by my table to greet and ask about my meal.  They have a great happy hour bar-food menu too.  I believe this happy hour special is just available in the bar area.  Also, Chili's emails specials to me.  These specials vary and range from free kids meals, free appetizers, special combo meals, etc.  I only have to show the waiter the coupon on my phone - no need to clip coupons."}
{"text":"Food always good. Had all shrimp  fajitas without tortillas. But service today was sloooooow. Server seamed distracted. Coffee was cold. No spoon  for coffee, no sugar. Had to keep calling him to the table."}
{"text":"Can't go up from my two original stars. Ordered a black bean patty and was pretty bland no onions, no lettuce or tomatos. All is extra for 1.00. Kinda weired. My friend ordered the chicken crispers and the chicken was unseasoned. The 5 stars go for our server Brianna she was very attentive and friendly. The strange thing for the whole 2 hours we were here the place was empty. Only us. Kinda creepy. I came here with a friend  because she likes the chicken crispers. I don't like the place."}
{"text":"Exceptional experience.  I walked in and was seated in about 2 minutes.  The waiter immediately took my drink order and then answered questions about the menu.  Even recommended modifying the food to make it better.  3 waiters took care of me and service was perfect.  When I went to leave after I paid tab and paid tip I was offered a \"to go\" cup showing genuine care.  Food was great.  This was the best Chili's experience I've ever had at any location, I will be back."}
{"text":"Here on a Monday and the bartender couldn't see past a three foot radius. I sat at the one seat open at the bar that had the leftovers from a previous guest for 30 minutes before I had to switch seats from the mess not being cleaned up. Then, I got a view of the kitchen and remembered why I don't come to chili's. It was a complete mess and the MANAGER was munching on food just adding on more weight. Gross. My memory serves me right."}
{"text":"Chili's is one of our favorite go-to restaurants because of the variety of good food and fast service.  We arrived around noon on Sunday and were seated immediately.  The chips and salsa are the best.  Our party of 4 also ordered a hamburger, California club sandwich, chicken ranch sandwich and margarita chicken dinner.  Everything was cooked to perfection and delicious!"}
{"text":"Always love coming here. Even though the food wasn't as good as it usually is we still get great customer service from Stephanie the waitress in the bar area. She's always smiling and gives us great service. The chip's, sausa and queso are always good. Had the fajitas tonight and weren't as good as usual but I will still come back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to say about Chili's.  I have been here many times, and the drinks are always well done, as well as the service.  My only complaint is not about this location, but all Chili's.  The menu plain sucks.  I am a return customer, because I try to give them a chance, and they sometimes add options, but never anything impressive.  I will return for the drinks, but eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"We came in, got seated in a few minutes. Our server Maija was great. Chips were delivered within a few minutes, and free. Our salad came out unbelievably fast a minute later. Chips refills and we were checked on a few times. Checkout was smooth, great job chilis and thank you Maija! Best salsa in America!"}
{"text":"After a Saturday of running around, we thought we'd stop here for dinner. If you call ahead, they will put your name on their waiting list. Thank goodness we did that because there were about 25 people waiting in the front of the restaurant, but we were at the top of the list and seated immediately. Our waitress, Cassie was cheerful and attentive throughout our visit. I ordered the drink special - a $5 Flirt margarita. It had a hint of raspberry flavoring and was a great compliment to my dinner. My husband ordered the Chicken Fajitas and I ordered the Ranchero Chicken Tacos. They were both fresh and flavorful. We decided to split the Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie for dessert. Yum! I recommend trying it. We had a good experience and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We dined here about a week ago. I had the fajitas which were absolutely wonderful! My husband had steak which was very tender but so salty that he could barely eat it. I told him to send it back but he refused. When the server came to ask how everything was,  I told her about my husband's steak. She offered to bring him another one but he declined. Unfortunately, I may never get him to go there again and I really liked it!"}
{"text":"Family is new in town, decided to have lunch at Chilis with friends. Hostess not friendly at all. Place was dirty. Tables were sticky and the food was not to par at all. Waitress not friendly no smile on her face and it seemed she did not like her job. My sons burger was raw in the middle. So different from California when the Health Department is always on business especially restaurants. Never again will we eat there."}
{"text":"Okay, before you write me off or send an angry mob with pitchforks to chase me off of yelp, remember this review is solely based on MY experience with the food 'I' ordered.   First, I groaned at the suggestion of eating at the lower-tiered chain. Sadly their reputation proceeded them. However, my disdain quickly vanished.  I ordered the Grilled Fish Tacos: 3 tacos with grilled chile-lime tilapia topped with house-made cilantro slaw, pico de gallo, sliced avocado, chopped cilantro & queso fresco wrapped. Substituted the rice and beans with a side fresco salad and quinoa and wheatberry salad.  When I opened my box, I was surprised to see how fresh and colorful everything appeared. The side salad was a nice mix of baby greens. The lime vinaigrette that came with the salad was refreshingly and light. Not overly oily at all. The Quinoa and wheatberry salad arrived warm. It had delightful balance of diced red peppers and sauteed onions that dressed up super-grains, and gave it a flavorful zest.  The fish tacos were amazing! They softly sat atop of what appeared to be wheat flour tortillas on a bed of fresh shredded cabbage - not coleslaw (this is very important to note, as there have been other offenders), drizzeled with pica de gallo and piled with generous slabs of ripe green avocados. The sauce was hiding underneath.   Visually, this was not what I expected out of Chili's. Slapped on a colorful bold platter, and could have passed in any other established Mexican restaurant.  They were so tasty! The tilapia was well seasoned and brought out the entire flavor of the tacos, complimenting the otherwise unadventurous cabbage. It tasted fresh, not a hint of fishyness at all.   Another thing I love about Chili's, sure some people may associate it as junk food or think of high sodium-inducing coma, but you can customize the meal to as healthy or as unhealthy as you want it to be.  For example, you can go with the Bacon Ranch Beef Quesadillas, topping at a whopping 1,800 calories with a sides of Mac and Cheese, which are an additional 490 calories. Or instead, you can choose the Fish Tacos (820 calories for all three!) with a Quinoa and wheatberry blend (a mere 130 calories), and still have enough room - calorically speaking - left for dessert, and not feel guilty about it.  I'm just so thrilled I was able to have a great meal at Chili's!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Chili's quite often and I never used to have problems. The past 3 times I have ordered to go I have had nothing but issues. The first time, I ordered a burger with specialty items such as avocados which I paid extra for and never got them. I called and let it be at that. The second time, I ordered a burger once again and it was a plain burger and my boyfriend was missing something from his order as well. That time I called and requested my money back. The third time (and my last at this location) I paid extra for more ranch and they didn't even give me 1. The food that my boyfriend had ordered looked as though it had been sitting out for hours. When I called this last time (I was calling for 20 minutes because no one would answer) I finally got ahold of the manager and his response was \"Oh I'm sorry, do you want to come back for some ranch?\" Now if I lived right across the street I might have considered it MAYBE but I live 15 minutes away and 2 small containers is not worth the gas money. His solution, I'll send you gift cards... Two weeks later, still not have received them. I am not one to write reviews or bash on anyone in retail but I am beyond frustrated with this Chili's"}
{"text":"Love me some Chili's Place is very nice great service and very friendly Beware around dinner 6pm or so this place usually you wait to get seated.  When I visit this is how I roll:  Waitress comes to the table I will have a Presidente Margarita and an order of the classic nachos please.  Waitress comes back to table SIr are you ready to order Well I am still deciding can I have another Presidente Margarita please, while I mole over what I am craving from this menu.  Waitress comes back to table I believe I am ready..........I will take the Ribeye with the loaded mashed potato's and steamed broccoli.....     And please bring me another Presidente Margarita while I am waiting  Then when my meal comes guess what else I am going to have.  Yes the very awesome Presidente Margarita  Love me some Chili's................ And yes they have the killer 2 for $20 deal everyday!!!!!  Check out their menu here: http://www.chilis.com/EN/Pages/menu.aspx"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza 1 hr later got a burnt pice of crust with some chess on it,won't be visiting again,oh and don't expect refills any time soon"}
{"text":"Terrible place. Had a late lunch. About an hour after I ate there, instant sickness. I've been in the bathroom since. I'll never go back. Not to mention really awkward staff. There were open booths available but yet we weren't allowed to sit in them. Made no sense. AVOID THIS CHILIS."}
{"text":"We were seated and initially the service was good. We were a large party and expected a wait but come one 1.25 hrs to get food. Every table around us was seated after us and served before us. We ordered burgers and mac n cheese. Wtf!!!!    This locations is notorious for slack service but this takes all.   Run don't walk from this place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We sat without a server being assigned and the waited for 15 mins before we asked for a server and we learned that no one had been assigned. The server who decided to help us couldn't get the order correct and the food took forever to get out. Simply avoid  this place!!!!!!!  It is not the Chilis before the increase in minimum wage. Run don't walk away from this place!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were greeted and quickly seated! The waitress was awesome! Food was hot and great Mango peach Tea"}
{"text":"We decided to make a Togo order which was awful we have ate here before and had better experiences but unfortunately our to go food was not cooked properly the burger that was supposed to be cooked at least medium was absolutely rare! We did not eat a single bite of it! Unfortunately we will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"Eh, my experience was just ok; it really wasn't anything special. I used to go to Chili's a lot when I was younger and I remember their service and food being much better than it is now. I'm fairly disappointed that they don't do anything for birthdays.I took my friend here on her birthday because Chili's is her favorite restaurant and I could barely get a \"happy birthday\" out of the staff. The spicy shrimp tacos were not spicy and just mediocre. The rice was dry and the beans were reminiscent of an aluminum exterior. Our waitress was also noticeably absent throughout the meal. My final complaint is that they do not take reservations; this is a huge turn-off to me as a customer. I think their one saving grace is their chicken crispers; I tried a bite of my friend's and they were actually really good. Overall, I'm not really impressed and it just feels like another generic franchise to help decorate Prospect Ave."}
{"text":"The food and service were good- The problem was other employees! We were seated in a back booth-Other employees  kept talking loud and jumping up and down in booth behind me like two year olds-making our booth jolt everytime!  Then they were sweeping next to booth while eating! Get this straight-We are paying guests! You work there! Never again-"}
{"text":"Worst service sat us down at a dirty sticky table and then no service for over 15 minutes  ,sat and waited for a waiter or waitress to show with no such luck . No one ever came by to take drink order . Finally just got up and left."}
{"text":"I received a $25 gift card to Chili's. It's been years since I've eaten there, so why not take the family out for Sunday brunch? I walked into the Chili's at 9501 W. Charleston today around 2:00 PM. with my wife, 11-year-old son and my 4-year-old daughter. No one was there to greet us, but I understood that it was a Sunday afternoon, the place was jam-packed and more than likely, they were very busy. We were the only ones waiting to be seated and they did seat us at a comfortable booth within minutes, so that wasn't really my issue.   We quickly noticed that there were little tablets on each table to keep the kids busy while the food was being prepared and we were very impressed with the idea! And for 99¢, you can purchase unlimited usage during your visit, which seemed fair. From that point on, everything seemed to go downhill. Not exaggerating, but it took about 20 minutes for anyone to get to our table. Again, I understand the place is busy, but that was unacceptable. Of course, we had four different employees pass us with the classic \"someone will be with you in a minute.\" I wanted another tablet so both kids can play and when one employee (I did not catch his name) passed by, I stopped him to ask for one. He said he'll bring one over, but after ten minutes, I frustratedly got up and grabbed one from another table myself!  The server finally arrived and asked us if we were ready to order. A nice apology for waiting would have sufficed my frustration a little bit, but there wasn't one. Regardless, my son ordered a chicken quesadilla. I had the beef enchiladas, my daughter wanted a cheese quesadilla, and my wife decided on some southwestern chicken salad. Here's the thing; except for some fish, my wife doesn't eat meat. She asked to substitute the chicken with the salmon instead. The server said that they \"cannot do that.\" I asked her why, but she continued with \"I can ask the chef, but I don't think they will do that.\" Both my wife and I looked at each other puzzled. We eat out very often and not once did we have issues having a meat to fish substitution anywhere. \"What's the big deal?\" I asked her. She said \"I can do the shrimp instead of the chicken, but not the salmon.\" I said, \"I thought you said that you can ask, so can you please go do that...my wife doesn't eat shrimp.\" We also asked for a separate dish so that my wife can share her salad with our daughter.  The food arrived promptly, not by the original server, but some arrogant guy who I wish I would have remembered his name, but I didn't plan on writing a review. Guess what? They substituted my wife's dish as requested. The server (or order taker) made an issue for no reason whatsoever. There were no mistakes with the orders, but they did forget the extra plate for my daughter. The guy made a facial gesture of frustration, which we did not appreciate. He returned very quickly with a small blue bowl completely dirty with watermarks and finger smudges! Disgusting! He left fast before I can say something and before we could ask for a refill on our refillable drinks. We did catch our original female server and asked for the refills, which she forgot to bring until we reminded her while she passed our table a second time.  Finally, all the food was great. The dishes tasted great, except that my wife could barely eat her salad since it was VERY SPICY, let alone serve it to our daughter! The server knew that that was our intention and it ticked me off that both of them failed to say something! When my wife got the guts to complain, the guy server just stood there quiet with a look of \"yeah, whatever,\" and didn't offer a replacement or even an apology!   In conclusion, I believe that in the restaurant business, food and customer service are equally important. Therefore, although the food was good, the service was terrible! Do we plan on going again? I believe in second chances and giving the benefit of the doubt. We probably will visit once more, but when the place is less crowded and we intend on sharing today's experience with the manager and if the service isn't flawless, then there are limitless choices in dining out in Las Vegas. I'm sure they already know that."}
{"text":"Like the food. Like the staff.  Music is so jacked up loud you can't talk.  O well. Byebye left and walked over to sammy's"}
{"text":"Tried their lunch special and oh man it was definitely worth it. Depending on which entree you get, the most you will pay for their lunch special is $8. I got their loaded baked potato soup for my appetizer and it was full of creamy goodness. The toppings were a nice touch. For my entree, I chose the double burger. I thought the patty was a little dry but for $8, I am not complaining. It also came with fries. For the soup, burger, and fries, it was very cheap. Service was mediocore. The little electronic screen on our table was very annoying because it took up a lot of space on our already small table. I will definitely try the other entrees on their lunch special menu again. I also had the strawberry lemonade. I like that it was bottomless."}
{"text":"NO matter where I've dined at a Chili's, I get the same 3-greats: GREAT FOOD (taste and serving) GREAT SERVICE GREAT PRICES With the above knowledge, Chili's is one of two restaurants that I frequent when I'm traveling.   One of the greats, without the other is a cause for no return visit to an establishment."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. The servers looked lost as well. Felt bad for the main lady working the bar because the other guy wasn't helping her. What a shame."}
{"text":"My night at Chilis on the corner of Bell and N.W. Point Parkway in Surprise Arizona. On Wednesday night on Sept the 20th my parents treated my wife and I for dinner. We arrived at Chilis and where seated right away, not the first time we have been to Chilis, which my parents are avid fans of their 2 for $22 deals, especial their steaks which the absolutely love.  We were served right away and had our drinks in no time at all, our waiters came back a couple minutes later and took our orders and had a great attitude, extremely sweet and attentive. About 5 minutes later my parent's salads came out and we had a great time talking and enjoying our evening. About 10 minutes later, just a couple minutes after my parents had finished their salad the manager came out with our food, couldn't ask for better timing. The manager was very attentive to our enjoyment of our food when he was dropping it off, he even made sure my parents cut into their steaks to make sure they were done correctly. My dad's was perfect, however, my mom's was a little under cooked, the manager was very apologetic and accommodating and took her steak back to cook it a little bit longer. After he left we all dug into our food. I had ordered the Ultimate Burger and could not believe how greasy it was, so much so that the wax paper it was served on was puddled with white liquid grease from the burger. When the waitress came back out with my mom's steak she inquired how everything was and I informed her that the burger was pure grease and tasted horrible. She offered to fix the situation but I really didn't want to wait for another meal to be cooked and brought out since everyone at the table would pretty much be done with their food and I didn't want to be eating alone. She apologized and the manager came back shortly later and apologized as well. So far, besides my food the night had been perfect, our bill came and my mom had given three 25 dollar gift card out of the four she had with her, since are bill was just over 50 dollars. When the waitress returned she informed us that we still owed a little over 2 dollars and did not return any of the gift cards. After waiting several minutes, we asked a bus boy to grab our waitress thinking that she may not come back since she may have assumed we were done and would be leaving. After she returned we informed her of her error and she fixed it right away, and informed us that she was over loaded with 11 tables and must have missed swiping one. Ok an honest mistake, after getting our gift card back with the balance the manager came by and I told him I probably will not be returning due to the burger I received. His response was shocking, he giggled shrugged his shoulders and muttered \"whatever\" I was shocked and appalled at this. My parents could not believe this reaction and were disgusted. As we were leaving I asked the bus boy the manager's name so that I my advise the corporate office how their customers are viewed and treated. The manager came out and asked to speak to us outside where I told him his attitude was unacceptable and asked for this card, he stated we brought is waitress to tears, we were shocked as we treated the waitress with candor and respect and left her a gracious tip. I asked him for his card once more and he said I'll get you one, when I went to follow him inside he informed me to not follow him and I was no longer welcome in this establishment. WHAT!? I could not believe I was being kicked out of an establishment for asking for a manager's card. I have never had such an experience in a restaurant. We were not looking for anything for free and we did not create a scene, nothing validated this type of reaction. If the manager just said \"I am sorry sir we will try to do better next time\" I would have been happy, but giggling and shrugging his shoulders and not caring about is customers is just unacceptable."}
{"text":"The food was very very good now the bacon burger is the best when i took a bite and juice came dripping down my throat mmmm"}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat when you take a bite of the bacon burger its just juice coming out of the burger"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. Waited 15 minutes to be sat (not bad), but then waited 15 minutes for a server to even come to our table, and she didn't even tell us her name. Dessert was delicious, but her service was awful. Only came to our table twice the whole time we were there. Waited another 20 minutes for her to come back and get our cards to pay but luckily we all had cash so we just left cash and she was no where to be found on our way out. 6 of us and literally got water and dessert. Shouldn't have been too complicated."}
{"text":"This Chili's is like all the rest I've been to. If you come in with low expectations, you will be satisfied. I was going to rate it 2 stars, but the chicken enchilada soup here was very delicious. If you know what to expect from Chili's, this isnt any different."}
{"text":"So I love chilis. I always have. Their salsa is dynamite. My best friend and I would have monthly dates here years ago. As the years have come and gone, my best friend moved to Europe so my dates have been replaced by my boyfriend, but I have always come back - this place has gone to crap. Specifically, the service. As I mentioned, the salsa is awesome. Probably why I keep coming back and why I ask for two containers of salsa when I order the tables chips and salsa. In the past maybe 10 times here, I would say twice the server remembered the second salsa. It would be all good if I didn't know any better. The main reason I ask for two is because I know the server isn't going to check on me after she gives me this food unless I track her down and ask for another.  I've also worked in food business for 10 years so I get it. But there really is no excuse to not give a lemon when someone asks for water or at least ask if you'd like one. It also takes a minimum of 7 minutes for our first drink and said chips and salsa. I don't think I was ever checked on after the food was given to us either. Refills? Might as well bring your own.   If this was one specific server, it would be different. Not everyone is cut out to work in restaurants. It sucks but the money can be great. But I haven't had even a mediocre server at this chilis in literally years. Someone needs to step up and hire a whole new staff or retrain the employees."}
{"text":"Lost a customer tonight, the only reason I gave them two stars is that they bought us our drinks, nothing else...I had two tired and hungry kids and had worked all day myself, I just wanted a nice meal. We had a standard easy order, the waitress just kept walking by back and forth as an hour had lapsed, when we asked where our food was she replied that she was sorry and that they were busy and that she would check for us. She never followed up and we, along with several other tables who obviously were getting the same level of service paid for our drinks and left. No manager in sight the whole time. Next time we'll spend our money elsewhere, we prefer to support local businesses anyway."}
{"text":"Things were ok cocktails, cheese curd app was really good.  Steak and chicken entree were good.  I would say the main improvement would be the timing.  Everything was very slow but it didn't bother us."}
{"text":"This location, I hope, is the only one that's this bad.  When we came in, we were seated quickly; though the welcoming atmosphere was missing and staff demeanor was not very friendly.  Our server kept apologizing about us having to wait over an hour for our food, when the \"busy night\" didn't happen till after we ordered.  Even then, a few tables coming in after us, were served up to 15 minutes before us....      The previous incarnation of Chili's around there (the old one at University and Mill) was terrific, never a complaint.  Too bad I can't say that for this one.....       Now, this is more personal preference; though I preferred the old decor.  The odd collectibles from around the country and different Chili cook-off's.  I'm not too keen on the \"modern\" look.  It comes away from what many associate with Chili's."}
{"text":"Not much to say about Chili's and it forever revolving menu.   This is my experience today. As usual, and I think it must be a policy, I'm not greeted at the door when I walk in. I came in after a family of 3. No Greeter was near or in sight. The waiters were working their tables, the bar had only one patron. We stood there for a few. Another family (4) came in after us and a couple also. Finally the greeter showed up and since he wasn't there to greet us when we walked in, had no idea who came in first. So he got the family info and also the couple's .. I asked to just go in the bar area since he had no idea who was supposed to come first.   The bartender is the saving grace of this restaurant. Lee was attentive even when the bar started to get packed with patrons. He called me by name and made sure I was taken care of. He even sweetened the unsweetened ice tea (ALL RESTAURANTS SHOULD SERVE SWEET TEA!).   The food was good for a mid day lunch. I had the Big Bites. My problem (which would have made this a 3 star rating if it wasn't for Lee) was that the menu did NOT specify that they put bacon on them. For someone who doesn't eat pork, ruined them. Fries were a little salty, but overall the meal was good.   SIDENOTE: I have been to several different Chili's and am never greeted at the door and usually have to wait till whom ever is supposed to be at the door to arrive. Waiters just look at you cause that's not their place.   Shout out to Lee the bartender for being such a great guy at his job! I salute you and the store manager should do the same."}
{"text":"The service is great!  They make a special dish for Andrew that they purée. :-). Above and beyond!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever had from a chilis. Called twice to place to-go order and was put on hold and forgotten about. First time was 6 minutes the 2nd was 4. I went in person instead to place the order, the place wasn't very crowded at all and yet still had to wait for someone to come take my order for another 5 minutes.  Once she finally came and begun taking my order she stopped mid - conversation and said she'd be right back.  8 minutes later I'm Still standing there waiting for my order to be taken. Finally left as I'd obviously been forgotten about again. I'll NEVER go back and I'll warn anyone I know to never use that location again. Thanks for the frustrating waste of time ."}
{"text":"Last night's dinner took 50 minutes to get out to us (4 of us).  All the tables around us had eaten, paid, refilled with new diners, and they were eating.  The server came to us 30 minutes after taking our order and said she didn't know what was going on in the kitchen, but \"here's some chips and salsa\".  I'm on a very special diet and can't eat chips.  No one ever asked us if they could bring us something to munch on that was healthy.  45 minutes into the wait, I called the manager over and told him he had 5 minutes to bring us our meals, or we would walk.  Our meals came 5 minutes later and my steak was raw.  I showed the manager and he took it off the check.  The entire incident could have been handled better.  For instance, why didn't they put our orders to the top of the list when she realized we'd been sitting there for 30 minutes?  By the 45 minute mark, the Manager should have been to our table without us having to seek him out.  Horrible experience!  I will never visit that location again!"}
{"text":"I tried giving this location a chance but their pickup service was always worse than the time before. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone. The eye rolls I received from the persons manning the pickup counter are deadly."}

She insisted that three of us should fit on a tiny table for 2. And refused to merge the other 2 person table right next to it. She insisted she needed to merge this table with an existing table with family already eating. And they did not complain about their seating...this place is completely unprofessional and 0 customer service..won't ever come here again"}
{"text":"We were at the Airport in Las Vegas on a bit of a delay. So we went to sit down and eat at Chili's. The hostess was nice,she sat us at a small table in the bar, stating this was all that was left as they were full up. Sorry to say our Server hated her job!   That is sad ,because,it is not a bad place at all.   The food was really good. I got soup and egg rolls,excellent and my boyfriend got a Burger and fries. We had to ask for refills on our drinks, but the worst was I had to ask for napkins and Silver ware. That is just not cool in my book. She was storming around the whole time,mad at everyone she worked with as well.  Everyone else there seemed pretty happy to be there. So that is why I only took one star down. A bit high priced ,but it is the Airport. Both of our foods were fab though. I would go back, just hopefully with another server."}
{"text":"We came here one hot evening for a quick dinner. We had the nicest young lady as our server. I think her name was Georgia ,but I might be wrong on that. I should of written it down. She was so sweet and so attentive. This is a newly built Chili's. As they had torn the other one down now. That one had been there for about 26 years or more.  Anyway, it is bright and airy inside. Very clean and modern looking.  We were seated right away.  We did not wait long for our food at all. It was really Good!  I got the salad with shrimp and Fruit in it. It was fresh and very refreshing. I would certainly order that again. My dining companion got the Steak and Ribs. He said it was very good as well. We would come back here for sure, and hope that we had the same lovely server. The odd thing was,which is probably the wave of the future.Is that you pay at your table with this little machine that is attached to the table. You can play games on it while you are waiting for your food and other such nonsense. But, Tempe is a College town. They cater to that crowd. I am not complaining it is just different than what we are used to. We would go back for sure though. Lots of Parking in the lot as well. Right on University on the North side of the road."}
{"text":"Haven't had Chili's in over a decade and had to pop in since we're here on vacation anyways.  Service was great.  I had their guacamole & salsa appetizer.  Wish the salsa was chunkier and spicier.  Guac needed some lime juice and salt.  I got their fresh mex bowl which was decent, but no chipotle/qdoba quality.  My SO got their BLT and it was not good, but loved it came on a pretzel bun.    Overall it was decent food with good service.  Love that they have the little tablet where you can just pay instead of waiting for the waitress."}
{"text":"Drinks are HORRIBLE Margaritas too sweet and NO BOOZE AND thus...WAY over-priced. My Presidente barely had any ice in it and was luke warm too. Was here in April with a friend before a movie. The food looked as yuck as the drinks.  They wanted us to pay via the electronic thing on the table and it was quirky.  We were like. Really?  We are having a problem with the thing not working and you want to help us through it instead of taking our checks and credit cards and doing it yourself?  We came for a couple of drinks NOT training on your crap equipment.  NEVER going back. RIP."}
{"text":"First off, I am used to dining at chain restaurants with par to sub-par experiences. With that being said, i wasn't too thrilled about this dining experience either. The place was dimly lit with no open blinds so it was like walking into a cave that reeked of old cafeteria food. Me and my friend ordered the fried pickles as an appetizer, the pick-2 fajita combo - chicken and steak - \"cadillac style\", and 2 beers. My total bill was over %70. The fried pickles were extremely salty with little to no breading. The fajita toppings arrived 5 mins before the actual entree. The entrees arrive to our table.  I noticed mine had a lot of extra meat. My friend's portion was barely adequate for a small child let alone a grown adult. The steak was very fatty and not \"heated\" properly. The beans were watery and very heavily salted as well. I don't think that each and every menu item has to be \"chipotle\" style, even though yes it is a southwestern restaurant. My only complements on this experience were a) the server was extremely attentive to our needs, even though she was more heavily focused on serving her family at the next table over, and b) the use of self -serve touchscreens at each table, which allowed for drink refill requests, desserts, paying the check, which was cumbersome at best, and game apps for the kids, if you didn't mind shelling out $1.99 for games that come free on most cell phones. As far as the overall food quality goes, I've had better, much better."}
{"text":"Came in tonight with my family and we were well taken care of by JOSH. He was fantastic with his customer service and actually listened when I asked for ranch. Kudos to him and a word of advice to his GM, I'm a GM myself and these type of employee's are ones to hold on to! Thanks JOSH for a great experience."}
{"text":"We walked in waited to be acknowledged but nothing. The place was not that busy and the waitresses were just looking our way but did not say anything to us.  Not friendly at all. Every other chilis I've been to has been very friendly and acknowledge you as you walk in the door."}
{"text":"Waiter was on point tonight, helped out with the menu, took his time with us and even helped us with out check. Service was on point from the moment we walked into the door! Couldn't be happier from tonight's dinner!"}
{"text":"When did they get tablets to browse the menus and for payment? What I found strange was the fact that the server was trying to promote unlimited games for I think 99 cents? What happened to the gold old days of having good conversations instead of being tied to technology. The water was pretty bad. We had to order an iced tea to get the taste out of our mouths and even then it wasn't great. The food was mediocre. My go to dish, the country fried steak was overcooked. Our server didn't come by at all to check on us. Was kind of glad we could just close out the bill on the tablets, pay and leave. I don't think the staff would want to hear how unhappy we were overall with the food and lack of service."}
{"text":"Service was good! Restaurant was packed and staff still manage to get everyone attended. No complaints other then food taking a bit to long. The flavor of the food was good. Seem to be really small food portions for the price."}
{"text":"My husband and came in for some dinner and I ordered the chicken enchiladas and soft chicken taco. When my food arrived it was not what I ordered. I brought to the waitress attention immediately and her reply was \"yes you did\" I said I did not order this and she started arguing. I looked up and said are you arguing with me?  She then again told me basically I am shit out of luck. She then offered to get me the manager and it's been 30 minutes and I am still waiting.  Very bad customer service. I am not happy.  Manager finally showed up and he is just as snarky. Unbelievable attitudes. I am the easiest one and will stick with going to the Chili's at the rainbow location. Never any problems and treated like a guest.  Waitress name: Alicia  Managers name: never introduced himself (turned out to be Daniel Smith) He was half rude and never listened to my complaint. I honestly didn't want the meal deducted but he just said fine I will remove it. I said ok but really is that how you handle customer service by not listening. Very poor service. Update!! We paid our bill at the table and printed out our receipt. After the talk with the manager we were never offered refills or ever spoken to again.  How hurtful.  We got up and were walking out the front door and the waitress Alicia charges toward us and offers me a piece of paper and says here is your receipt and I replied \"No thank you I printed it out at the table\"  she then grabs my husbands hand and pulls his hand out of his pocket forcefully and stuffs the receipt and some cash in his pocket and says \"Here keep this you need it more than me!  I am not kidding this is like a lifetime move it really happened and I am still in shock.  Me not realizing what just happened turned around and saw my husband following her to a station and he stood there until someone retrieved a manager.  I then saw a different manager (Travis McLeod) speaking to my husband and then my husband came to the front door where I was waiting for him inside.  He told me that Mr. McLeod was appalled by the actions of the waitress and said No we don't treat our customers like that.  I am not sure how to remove the stars to a zero but I am copying this review to Chiils main office and management of the location on Las Vegas Blvd in the Belz Mall that we went to. I feel Alicia should not be serving guests or dealing with the public. Calling people liars is not a good mirror image that Chili's has spent years creating."}
{"text":"Tableside guacamole is a must!!! Have been coming here for a while and keep trying different things on the menu but havent found anything that is absolutely amazing other than the guac. The servers are very nice but the manager could be heard yelling at a staff member while he was in the kitchen.   This is your average chain restaurant with nothing that really stands out."}
{"text":"I'm not one to go to Chilis for the service, but the service at this hole is absolutely awful. After being told there is a 15-20 minute wait, we stared at an empty four top that needed to be bussed for over 10 minutes. We also watched as another table say and waited for their waiter (no pun intended) for about the same length of time. This sheer disregard for running an efficient establishment in an airport shows that this chilis has very poor management."}
{"text":"Food was good. Had lunch special and the prices aren't all that bad, plus 10% cash back with Bank of America. You couldn't beat it with a stick!"}
{"text":"We got seated right away which was awesome because it was super crowded!  And they make a pretty decent pina colada!!"}
{"text":"Today I was reminded of why I stopped going to Chili's.  Server approached the table for the 1st time and said: \"Anything to drink?\" Husband and I were taken aback just a little, she noticed and said: \"Oh, welcome.\" She comes back, puts the drinks on the table and walks away. Comes back after a few minutes: \"Have you decided on food?\" Takes our order and walks away; and that's how our interaction was throughout our meal. No \"excuse me\", or \"you're welcome\". Or a smile.  I had a grilled chicken sandwich that was inedible. The chicken had a weird texture, tasted weird, and even the color was off. The lettuce on the sandwich looked like it had been kept out of the fridge for a few days. Gross.  Poor service, terrible food. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Had a flight out at noon so I decided to check out this place.  Breakfast is only served here until 10AM.  So placed my ordered for a cheesesteak sandwich.  Definitely had better.  But the wait staff was awesome."}
{"text":"I've been to this locations tons of times before and never had a problem, always had good service and food had been perfect. Tonight unfortunately wasn't the case as my boyfriend and I decided it was a good idea to go in and have a appetizer night (Our usual onion sting and triple dipper to share) at around 8:30. We were seated quickly and was approached by a waiter within the first 5 minutes of sitting down. We decided on our drinks and I was given a regular lemonade instead of the usual strawberry lemonade my boyfriend had ordered for me. The waiter was soon back to change that when we pointed out the small mistake. We ordered our food (triple dipper with  regular big mouth bites, potato skins and honey chipotle crispers and our onion strings). Didn't see our waiter for a good 10 minutes after that until he bought my boyfriend another drink in which he soon hurried back away from our table and on to the bar area. Another what seemed like 15 minutes passed and our food finally arrived, put on the table and the waiter was gone once again. Unfortunately we received the new guacamole big mouth bites (We don't eat guacamole), potato skins were warm in the middle but beginning to go cold on the outside but the crispers were  hot enough to actually have to blow on before eating. The onion strings were kind of cold and the batter was flaking off the onions (I've never had this happen before?). We waited a good 5 minutes for our waiter to come back and check on us to see if everything was ok but he never arrived. After 10 minutes we decided to start eating what we had as we were very hungry to begin with. We didn't see our waiter again until he came over to clean up our plates and give us the check. I'm not one to normally complain but we didn't really have a chance to complain to start with tonight. The waiter was very bland and didn't really want to deal with us to begin with, never took the time to listen to our complete order or check in on us. We had cold-ish food and just wanted to leave once the check came to the table. I will probably have to keep close to home from now on and eat at the surprise location, I know what kind of service I will be receiving from there."}
{"text":"Yet another disappointing experience at this location at this point they need to shut this place down or just revamp the staff because they have noooo costumer service or common sense!!  we get there and the hosts tells us oh 25 minute wait on a booth! So 5 minutes later she gets off the clock and we notice the table we are waiting on just got there food !! So at this point is 20 minutes had past we approach the other host and explain what the other on had said and she just looks at me like I don't know why she even said that !while I'm talking to her the  manager was there looking and just let us walk out like nothing happen!! The manager needs to go back and get some management skills!! This is our last and final time going to this place!! SOME OF THE LAZIEST EMPLOYEES AND MANAGEMENT STAFF IN LAS VEGAS, will be calling corporate office to get this place shut down!!   Oh and on my prior review i never got a call back in regards to that situation!!"}
{"text":"Haha! I didn't understand why a lot of people kept saying to me,\"Breakfast of champions!\" as I walked out of here with my early morning breakfast at McCarran airport.  With airport food, it's always a fine balance between price and getting something edible. In the end, my Chinese Thrift Gene allowed me to get a plate of wings for a calorie laden breakfast  Not bad for chain food and the crispy warm wings assuaged some hunger pangs. l like the the dips too  There was an area of seating nearby, which was in a less hectic part of Terminal B, so a nice place to start your day off with an early flight"}
{"text":"It was just OK! I wouldn't come back to this place. I've experienced at another better CHILI's. My chicken was not that great because of burn and cooked too long. The server has checked on us once in a while. We were not satisfied with this visit."}
{"text":"Hi, I am a legit foodie and I use to love chili's. However today when I went to pick up my order from the chili's at 8164 S. Tryon St in CLT NC that changed. First off the website did not work so I called to pick up my order. The lady of the phone abruptly hung up on me without telling me when it would be ready for pick up. I then drove over to chili's and waited 30 minutes for my order of a grilled Santa Fe salad and quesadilla lunch combo. I didn't complain when she forgot my drinks, instead just asked nicely and then thanked her and left.   Once I got back to my office I placed the salad Down on my desk and attended what was left of our manager meeting.  At this point I was starving. You see I am an HR manager who had been doing open interviews since 9:30 AM (nonstop). I only had an hour break (2pm-3pm) so i thought Chili's would be quick, easy, and delicious. So i was so looking forward to sit down and eat my favorite salad before the next rush of interviews. I open the salad container expecting to see grilled chicken slices with guacamole and pico de Gallo smothered all over, with little tortilla strips spread about, but instead I got this....image1.jpeg I got grilled chicken on top lettuce...that was it. Any salad would have more than just lettuce with grilled chicken on top. I was pissed and hangry. I went to grab the phone to call chilis and complain but then a walk in interview showed up and I never got the chance. So thanks Chili's for making a stressful day even worse because I had to settle for my protein bar instead of a real meal.  P.s. I was about to throw the salad away because I HATE fried chicken, but instead I thought I'd make lemonade out of lemons and gave it to this homeless man who always is outside of our store.   A salad that was made with no effort or consideration, was actually used for good because I care for others. Chili's made me wait half an hour for fried chicken over lettuce...what kind of customer service is that?  Sent from my iPhone"}
{"text":"Not expecting gormet food but my cheap piece of meat came out raw, like tartar raw. Sent it back to be refired.  Waitress was nice enough but sloooow. Not exactly packed at 11:45 on a Friday. So much for running in and grabbing a bite. Still waiting and it's 12:20. Instead of taking the whole plate, coulda left me the side salad. The avacado slices were pretty good."}
{"text":"How in the world is this place still open? It must be their happy hour. I have them another try, and got a cheese burger. How do you screw up a burger. Dry meat, stale bun. And their ribs used to be so good, but nothing special now. This is just a relic of the 1990's like TGIF, Bennigans, or Apple Bees. It is in a great location so perhaps another good restaurant will go in their soon."}
{"text":"Needed a casual place for a dinner meeting had the grilled  chicken salad in the bar seating area new cool iPads at table allow you to order immediately click for refills add extra items estimate food arrival time and pay your check had a great time great staff way to go I'll be back for sure !!!"}
{"text":"Ants on table- cold rice on hot dish? Don't bother!!! Gross. Manager never came over after informing server. Food- beef quesadilla s looked nothing like photo. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was super busy during the happy hour, but we were able to snag a table. Service was quick, food was hot and fresh. I wish the waiter filled my water more than just the once, especially since I ordered a margarita and had chips, but overall, a decent experience for being there at such a busy time."}
{"text":"For an airport, service & breakfast has always been great.  I look forward to arriving early to eat the breakfast burrito.  Add Cholula. Wish it was served throughout the day, but breakfast ends unfortunately.   Last week, I had the Chipotle Chicken & Waffles which was the closest lunch item to breakfast.  Very nice bite to the chicken & sauce.  It was absolutely delish w/ a sweet syrup that complimented well.  No stomachache here for airport food & this is my third or fourth time eating here.  It's a tad small so wish it was larger, other than that, no complaints."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food at Chili's Gastonia and I think the staff are attentive and nice. BUT the bathrooms need an overhaul. I always dread going in there. Toilets are always leaky and unflushed, stuff all over the floor and too dark, the one sink's faucet is too close to the edge of the sink... It's just nasty knowing the staff use those restrooms then prepare our food. Please, please fix the bathrooms cause I don't want to stop coming to Chili's Gastonia!"}
{"text":"Had the shrimp cajun  pasta. Hope the chef tossed some salt over his shoulder for luck after spilling a ton in the alfredo sauce. Wow!!! But the Texas toast was ok."}
{"text":"steak fajitas are amazing (marinated meat). The chips are light and freshly made. Had the chicken wings-ive had way better. Overall really good, will be back"}
{"text":"Definitely hoping for better I got the endless enchiladas that they're running on special and it took forever to get them out so I only got one round and ordered a second because my family had finished and we're ready to leave but we're willing to wait for one more round   My wife's steak was like rubber way over cooked!   Here is the kicker while we were waiting for my second round of the enchiladas a different server came to ask my wife about our kids and how close in age they were. Then she preceded to tell us about her teenage boy and how he gets annoyed by her once a month! (That's right here comes the period reference) she thought it was wise while we were sitting at dinner to start talking about \"shark week\" and how her son asked her when will she stop being cranky!!   Call me old school but that's nasty to be discussing with strangers while they're eating   That's when my second round of enchiladas came out and I decided.  Nope I'm done slid my card in the kiosk and headed out.   Won't be going back"}
{"text":"First visit and had the WORST service I have ever experienced at a Chili's.  Will never go back to this location. Food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I had a coupon and we were too hungry to try anything new. Should have known by the empty restaurant that this wasn't going to be good. The restaurant was so slow that they were sending servers home so I'm not sure why our food took so long. We parked in the lot next door since we planned to walk around afterward. Otherwise, the $10 fee would have been a waste.  Mom and I shared the loaded chicken fajitas and a triple dipper with southwest eggrolls, honey chipotle chicken strips and the sliders. The fajitas are a total joke. They taste like a Lean Cuisine. Seriously. The chicken tastes boiled and you can tell the \"grill marks\" are artificial. The peppers and onions underneath were soggy and either steamed or boiled. What's worse is the cheese sauce on top. It had no flavor. We filled up on our chips and salsa and my triple dipper, even though the chicken was cold. Whatever.  Unlike Pam Beasley, I did not feel God in this Chilis."}
{"text":"The server was very nice and we tipped her well. After all it isn't her fault the food quality here has gone way down hill. Honestly, nothing looked like the picture in the menu. Not even close. My husband ordered some manly BBQ Rib Platter and it came out on a cafeteria tray smothered in nastiness. The manager refunded the disgusting kids pizza which was nice. But overall, we were very disappointed. I noticed the atmosphere was updated and they are attempting to offer more \"natural\" selections, but they really need to spend time on the quality, presentation, and just taste of the food."}
{"text":"We took my granddaughter there for a birthday lunch, she's 7 and the whole staff made it a big deal for her. They all stopped by to wish her a good day, they even made her a hand drawn card and brought out a cake and ice cream for the three of us to enjoy. Food was amazing as the service was!!!  Definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"Waited 35 minutes in an empty restaurant. Poor, rude service. The chicken tasted rubbery and microwaved."}
{"text":"Everytime we go to this location on Sundays they say they are out of Bud light and force you to get bottled beer so you can't participate in happy hour. I could understand if this was a one time thing but this is the third time we have tried. We have visited at different times during day and it's the same line. We walked out and will no return."}
{"text":"We generally love this place.  They were definitely off a bit tonight.   Took over an hour for food and the burger was raw, chicken raw and nachos soggy and overcooked if that's possible.  Not happy this round.  Manager never apologized for the food being bad just immediately offered to cover the bill.  How do they make money.  Just remake it and call it good.  We don't want free food just a decent meal cooked properly."}
{"text":"They let animals in.  They're obviously not service animals (massive Great Dane and chihuahuas are amongst the animals I've seen).  Will avoid from now on.  It's not a fluke!"}
{"text":"So I decided to drive up and dine in at Chili's. Normally we order carry out.  After all, I just wanted a \"fuel stop\".   My God this place has gone down hill. I want to collect our next reward and never come back. Gross. Dirty and smelly. I remember when I had several friends work here and the place was managed like someone cared. Of course that was back in 2005 and  a lot  has changed. The bartender/server in the bar was very impetuous and rude. When I stated I only wanted water to start he asked, \"is that ALL?\" very loudly. Asked for the water without lemon and of course it came with lemon.  Now my Guacamole was not ordered as requested.   Done here--good luck. Perhaps new management is in order. As they learn from top down. And as I was once taught..you get what is expected from your employees."}
{"text":"This is the Arboretum Chili's.  You may have heard that Chili's corporately was going to respond to increasing pressure from places like Qdoba and Chipotle by greater emphasis on the Southwest dishes.  They definitely have made this change, and not for the better.  You can still find a few good old reliable burgers and salads that used to make this my go-to place for dinner with guests, but the new menu is so over-biased with Tex-Mex that the rest suffer.  Surprisingly the fajitas, long a staple at Chili's, were absolutely HORRIBLE.  The steak was tough and chewy .. and the portions reduced.  The new hot spicy taco shells they use for everything are also a horrible over-use of spice. After years of going here, my wife swore she'd never go again, it was that bad.  A shame."}
{"text":"I visited this chili's and the next day got a fraud alert from my bank, apparently some one at this location copied my credit card and has been using it. WARNING do not use your card at this location. It's the only time in six months I used my credit card"}
{"text":"average to below average in their quality of food...the service was a touch above average"}
{"text":"We ate here last night and I will never go back. The restaraunt was somewhat busy, but nothing too crazy. Maybe only half full. We only ordered a burger, a chicken wrap and 2 kid grilled cheeses. We waited over an hour for our food! The waiter, although very nice guy, was very slow and seemed overwhelmed. By the time we finally got our food, paid and left we had been there 2 hours. We had others things planned and did not have time to sit there for that long. Plus we had two restless kids with us, so I need somewhat speedy service. Service is just way too slow at that place. I was really mad by the time I left, and it takes a lot to get me that way as I am normally very patient and understanding. But that was just ridiclous. Don't go here unless you have a lot of free time and no where to be for the evening. Food is just okay.. definitley not worth an extremely long wait."}
{"text":"Your chicken fajitas taste like hot dogs and also have a hot dog consistency.  Manager said it was from the new marinade. Do you soak the fajita chicken in hot dog water? Smelled like boiled hot dogs too. GROSS. Won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Chili's can be a little inconsistent at times, but one thing I love is that they always have some kind of deal or coupon available for their customers. You have to show some respect for a place like that.  The service at this particular location was awesome, but the food itself varies depending on what you order. Some things are very good while others are awful. Stick to the fajitas and you will be fine. I also enjoy their boneless wings and the dessert cookie is delicious.   Chili's is a place I'll always come back to because of the deals they offer!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had to write a more atrocious review of a restaurant than the one I am about to write. My boyfriend and I were flying home to Salt Lake City from our weekend in Las Vegas and we stopped to eat at Chili's while waiting for our flight.   1. When we walked up to the hostess stand, the hostess made eye contact, turned and walked away from us with no acknowledgement. Once she returned, she sat us. She sat 3 couples in the tables next to us right after. (important for later)  2. I asked our server what the price range was on the margaritas as they weren't listed on the menu. She responded \"I couldn't tell you. I'm too new\". After waiting 15 seconds, I asked her to find out for me. I watched her fumble on the POS system for 5 minutes before she came back to give me a price.   3. I ended up ordering a Stella draft beer and my boyfriend ordered a Heineken. The bartender dropped our beers off and said \"Did she check your IDs?\" We answered \"Yes\" and he walked away. When it was served, it didn't taste like a Stella (nor was it in a Stella glass). I took it up to the bartender and told him that I didn't think it was a Stella. He responded saying \"Yeah, I have no idea what I poured you.\"   4. About 15 minutes after placing our ordered, our waitress came back and said \"Did I just have drinks for you guys?\" We were confused as to what she meant so we asked for clarification. She said \"Did you guys just order drinks or did you order food too?\" We said that we did and she said \"Oh okay, I got it\" and then proceeded to go to the POS system to put the order in. The 3 couples who were sat after us had already received their food.   5. 20 minutes after she realized she didn't put the order in, the \"manager\" brought out our food. We voiced our concerns to him. He said, \"Our POS system has been a little haywire today\" and shook off the fact that the first 45 minutes of our experience had been terrible. He told us he would put a discount on our check.   6. My fries were cold. There was no temperature in them whatsoever when they were served to me. The chicken looked nothing like the chicken I have previously ordered at Chili's either and I was afraid to eat it. Our server didn't stop back at our table for another 10 minutes. By that time, it wasn't worth it to ask for new fries. We still brought it to her attention.  7. Our waitress dropped our check off. She said \"the manager tried to help out a bit\". I looked at the bill and saw a $2.45 discount (10% off of ONE meal). Our previous bill was $46.00, with the discount they were asking us to pay $44.00. It was completely insulting. My boyfriend found the manager to talk with him again. He relayed all of our issues again. The manager took the receipt out of my boyfriend's hand and ripped it up. He said \"I will pay for it\". He sounded very irritated and demeaning.   8. After we got back home to Salt Lake City, my boyfriend started vomiting. He continued to vomit for the entire night and slept in the bathroom. He felt better the next day, so we believe it was food poisoning from his burger.   At no point during our visit here were we looking for free food. The only thing we were looking for was decent service and decent food. We didn't get either of those things. I doubt I will find myself in the Las Vegas airport again in the near future, but if I am I will stay far far away from this Chili's."}
{"text":"The waitress was okay, but my food was not. I ordered the tableside guacamole and that itself was very bland and had no flavor. I ordered the Cajun chicken pasta and received raw rubbery chicken. They replaced the chicken for me but the chicken again was very rubbery and nasty. Not sure if I wanna go back to chilis after this."}
{"text":"5 stars for the excellent service received from Curtis. He introduced himself, asked if we had any questions & gave us time to review the menu. Once we finally decided what we wanted, he promptly took our orders. Not once did he make our party of 5 feel rushed or too demanding when we had multiple requests. At times, I've left a restaurant feeling like we were an inconvenience because the waiter was just aggravated due to multiple tables or personal issues. Curtis gave 5-star service from beginning to end. His hard work & professionalism will take him far in life."}
{"text":"I like Chili's.  Of all the marketed neighborhood grills, they're honestly up there in regards to food taste and prices.  I can attest to that because me and the fam bam come here like clockwork it seems like lol ( bdays, holidays, etc ).  And we have figured that with all our distinct tastes this is a perfect place to go that will makes us all happy.     Now a few plates you can never go wrong with are their shrimp tacos and their fajita trio... will say though sometimes the trio plate will have a lot of onion to compensate for the skillet it's served on, but the last few times the servings have been more than generous.  This last outing the food tasted great, atmosphere was good and I have to tip my hat off to our server David who did a phenomenal job providing service as demanding as we were with 2 five year olds...     Thank you again we will see y'all shortly!"}
{"text":"I came in at 6:55 for my 7:00 to go order.. apprehensive only because every other time I have picked up from here there seems to been issues... late.. cold... missing items... usually I chat it up with people in the lobby and we guess about what is going to be wrong with our orders while we wait.   BUT I decided to come back one more time...because I had a craving for fajitas, and I wasn't feeling good, and I left my sick baby at home while the BF watched him while I ran out real quick!!  YEAH RIGHT!!!! 23 minutes I stood at the bar before someone asked me if they could help me, then my order was \"lost in their system\" it's \"never happened before\" \"they only started online ordering 3 weeks ago\" I've been using the app for months?!??! She basically didn't apologize for anything said do you still want to order...screw it I was hungry. I have hungry kids, I placed my order with someone else, because the lady who finally helped me didn't have time. WHAT?!?! Your a Waitress?!?! 7:55 60 minutes, after I came in I got my food.  Thanks for that speedy order...Chili's to go..your the best.  FYI I paid FULL PRICE and no discounts or even acknowledgement of their error was made."}
{"text":"Buyer beware of the new interactive table video thing-ama-jigs(They are like interactive screens that your kids can mess with while they eat). The waiter saw I had three kids and brought three of them over to our table, but he failed to explain that we would be charged for the use of them. IT is probably an oversight, but it is definitely something management should be training their staff to make sure the customers know they will be charged for using them."}
{"text":"On Valentines Day, my daughter and I went there.  They were great ~ Well timed meals, and every waitress/waiter was on point.  that made for an extra special dinner even though my husband was working :("}
{"text":"This is the worst Chili's I'ver ever been to. Everything tasted like it was old. The corn in a cob had dark brown sections and mashed potatoes tasted funny... I feel bad because employees were nice but I came for the food not the people."}
{"text":"The waiter only brought one drink when we both ordered bloody Mary's. Then he took forever to make the other one he actually came back to check on us and my mom said she still doesn't have a drink. He did give us water drinks that tasted like dirty Chandler water I'm sure it's unfiltered. The onion rings were what to be expected at a chain restaurant the utinsels were dirty even though they were wrapped up in a paper bag, crazy. Anyways we will never come here again."}
{"text":"Got here at 10 during the bar happy hour. They have really good specials. Recommend ordering the blueberry margarita, chips &salsa, guacamole basically everything"}
{"text":"My most recent visit last night left me very disappointed. I am used to good service, solid menu choices & a generally pleasant experience. However, last night, service was poor, food took forever & when my Margarita chicken bowl finally came it was sans chicken. I sent it back when the manager came over & asked how our experience was going. I should have just left at that point. What I got back was barely edible & left me wishing I could throw up & just start over!!! Nothing was comped, no apology & not going back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Just sucks. Our server was overwhelmed with 6 tables all at once. He was also super slow. Appetizer never came then the runner delivered entrees to our table. I complained to runner & manager shows up, apologized & offered to buy us dessert. Took 15 minute to get check from server & when I did the app was still on the check.  He then asked me if I wanted it removed. Really?!? It's been a long time since we've gone there and it'll be a long time before I return."}
{"text":"Definitely would come again! It might be the new vamp up of Chili's, but the fajitas were on point. Very light, fresh, and not greasy."}
{"text":"I came in today to watch the Indy 500 and learned that this chilis discriminates on people who have disabilities. When I sat at the bar and went to order a beer I presented my out of state identification card and was immediately turned down due to the fact that it was a identification card not a drivers license. When I mentioned the fact that it was state issued and I am legally unable to possess a drivers license in my state  due to the fact that I have a medical issue,they still refused to serve me, even though I am way more than the legal drinking age. All in all I'm not even mad about it, I just felt disrespected and judged, especially because I just wanted to grab a brew, a quick bite to eat and enjoy the Indy 500 on the way to the Coke 600 race. Lucky Fridays was right around the corner and was more than willing to accommodate my needs. After this run-in with chilis I will seriously reconsider patronizing this franchise again."}
{"text":"I have always had good food and great service at this Chili's.   I like it a lot!"}
{"text":"Chili's, your basic bar food selections and then some... We came here after going to the movies with a friend. I ordered the Chili's reinvented classic fajitas trio made with steak chicken and shrimp. My fried ordered the Chili's most popular plate according to the waiter, baby back ribs and a strawberry lemonade and I ordered iced tea, the food was great as always and the drinks were never empty.   There was this device on every table like a note pad  that I've never seen before, I asked the waiter what it was and he told me that it could be used to order additional drinks during the meal or dessert if I wanted to, also it could be used by kids to play games while waiting for their food  and even to pay your bill at the end using a credit card. I decided to give it a try and ordered dessert while we were eating. When we were done with the food they cleared our plates and brought the dessert the we had ordered through the machine. I swiped my credit card and paid the bill. Complaining about not seeing the waiter days are over, he's right there at the touch of a screen. The waiter came back to make sure we didn't need anything else and to thank us. Yes! I said.. Could you please put this device in a to go box? I need it at home while I watch the soccer games."}
{"text":"I think you guys need more stuff working at this location I was waiting about  40 min to get the food and also food wasn't any good"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever at Chili's. We have come here so many times it's our usual lunch stop or after church dinner stop. But I don't even know where to begin. Let's start with the server taking at least 10 minutes just to get our drink order and then after getting it taking another 10 minutes to get it to us. And then she FORGOT to put our order in we waited an hour for food. And only being offered more chips and salsa. My kids don't need to be filled up on chips and salsa they need their food. This server was just beyond worse and I have worked in customer service for 15 years. She after making all these mistakes avoided our table all together. So no apology for 5 starving children and one being a very tired toddler. As it's way past his bed time cause we waited an hour. Going on hour half. Chili's service has quit gone down hill tremendously. We were told our order would be rushed and take 10 minutes it now been 15 plus minutes. I can't believe the service we are getting."}
{"text":"It's a Chili's. Food is consistant with the others & clean. Go for happy hours to save some moolah."}
{"text":"This past Friday night, we took a party of 14, including 6 children under the age of 9, to dinner... during the busiest time of the evening... and during the holiday season! Yep, we were those people. To add to that chaos, 3 of us have some very peculiar allergies. Our server, Gage, was FANTASTIC. I can't say enough about him or his service. He was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, and a super good sport. We are also \"those moms\" - teaching our children to speak for themselves... Gage was as engaging with the kids as he was the adults. He made sure we had what we needed for the entirety of the night. It is not often that we can go out as a group... but this particular Chili's and this particular server, Gage, made it not only possible but enjoyable!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the Gilbert location. Went around lunch time (1pm) on Sunday and we were seated right away. They had a good deal for $10 and it included a salad, entree and dessert. I ordered the classic burger with a veggie patty. The veggie patty looked a little over cooked but it was good nonetheless. I got the molten lava cake and it was delicious! I usually don't like those types of desserts and I really liked it. The waiter was great and the service was good overall. I think it is a great deal when the have specials."}
{"text":"The service here was phenomenal! The teamwork between all the servers was amazing! It was like we had 3 servers that all knew what we had and wanted... great! The food is what stops this place from getting a 5... mediocre.   P.S. Coldest Beer I Have Ever Had!!!"}
{"text":"This visit to Chili's has been wonderful. I wasn't sure I would ever return to a Chili's after my last experience in Gastonia, NC, but I'm glad I gave in to my craving for Chicken Crispers.   Service was great, food was amazing, what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Food was good.   My enchilada was a little over cooked but ok.    The wait staff was in too much of a hurry and did not offer to explain the specials"}
{"text":"I ordered the chips & salsa with a house margarita & the grilled shrimp tacos for dinner.  Holy Toledo was it ever hot!  My mouth was on fire!!  I was so stuffed from drinking so much water I couldn't finish the tacos.  They were really good too.  The outside of my mouth even started to burn and I thought my throat was going to close shut.  They were so good!!!  I love Chilis but I think I might be allergic to the peppers they use because I thought I was going to die!    But they were really good............:-)"}
{"text":"Been here alot at this location but the place has been going down hill. Maybe new management, the floors walls and tables are very sticky and dirty, when u walk I slip and slide on the grease covered floors. My service has been nothing but mediocre. They forgot my kids dinner one time you cam see the dirty wipe marks on the the plates when they wipe thr edges off and the associates aurgu about imputting info in the computers. Only reason I came is that I had a coupon for kids eat free. I'm said to say but I'm not looking to come back."}
{"text":"We came in to have lunch today and have a wonderful meal. What happened to another party really me made me appreciate this location. They had a party of 15 come in and they opened up a section that was closed to take care of them. Now that's customer service."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Value is good. Drinks well made and the menu is broad. Onion rings are great as are the burgers. As a rewards member my main complaint would be the management of the system. Building points for the free dinner for two the points value escalated twice as we approached the required value. Not cool."}
{"text":"Started coming here when it opened. Hit and miss at best. Always have high hopes but often disappointed. Ordered the fajitas recently. Much more meat and better value. But..... onions and peppers were raw and cold. Not grilled fajita style. I brought this to servers attention and I was told that's how they do it now. Huh????? She said next time I have to ask for them to be cooked or else they just put raw veggies on the fajitas. Asked for Manager and got real reason that they were short a cook that night and she was sorry. Maybe telling people raw food is the new normal is not the way to go. Just saying."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but it was the service that was outstanding.  Our waitress was super friendly and very attentive.  The place was clean and pleasant.  Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chili's in Charlotte. Consistently awesome! Great boneless buffalo wings and the best mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I've been in the industry for almost 10 years and this was by far the worst service I have ever received. I was in the area and wanted to cure my hangover, so I was looking for a Bloody Mary and a cheeseburger. My spouse and I sat at the bar and ordered our drinks. The bartender took about 20 minutes to make two bloody Mary's. They were filled with mostly vodka (it was 2pm, I don't want to get drunk) and a splash of mix. It was served with no garnishes. When she handed it to us, she asked if we wanted celery. After saying yes and asking for limes, she handed us a stick with limes on it and a basket of celery. I asked for mine spicy and after I had had my drink in front of me for 10 minutes, she then asked if I wanted some hot sauce for my drink. I might as well have made my own drink at this point. Then we ordered two medium rare burgers and after about 20 minutes with no food, we started getting pissy. It wasn't long before my spouse (who is a chef) and I realized that she had forgotten to ring our food in. At the end of our horrible experience, she ended it with a snide comment. \"I mean, it IS a Saturday. We are busy.\" I will never step foot in that chilis again."}
{"text":"Horrible management and service. We were told that our wait time was 40 minutes, after an hour of waiting, we finally talked to the manager. The manager informed us that we were \"still behind people\" and I proceeded to ask about the many tables that were open in the restaurant. The manager then got an attitude and did not handle the situation professionally, now we are at Longhorn and having great service."}
{"text":"As far as chain restaurants go this is one of the better ones.  I hate Appleby's and I am not a huge fan of Outback.  Chili's has decent food, I like the boneless buffalo wings and I usually get ribs, a burger, or the buffalo ranch chicken sandwich.  We like the food and go here on a pretty regular basis.  They don't seem to have a lot of turnover in the wait staff which is always a good thing."}
{"text":"Great for lunch or dinner. Not a fancy place but has a good menu. They recently added new items to the dinner menu."}
{"text":"I had the most wonderful experience at Chili's on Sunday. My faith in humanity was taken to a new level.   I drove around trying to find a place to eat passed up quite a few, finally settling on Chili's even though I had to drive a little distance to get there.   Long story short, the food was great, my server Marissa was excellent and the manager made sure everything was ok.   When it came time to pay all I had was a old debit card that I thought I lost the previous week, a Home Depot, Walmart and JC Penney charge. I had accidentally torn up my credit card thinking it was my old debit card.   I was so upset, I talked to the manager Michael told him my situation and he was so understanding. I offered to go home and get money to pay, he would have no part of that. He said not to worry lunch was on him.   All I can say is Chili's I am eternally grateful because this experience could surely had had a different ending.   Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This will be my last visit. It hasn't always been this way and I have had good service and food in the past but the last two visits have been less than good. First the place was empty at 1pm on a Saturday which should be the first clue. No one seems particularly interested in the few customers they had and our drinks took quite awhile even with minimal customers. Food came out fast and was overall ok. But with so many places to eat I  am officially moving on."}
{"text":"Yikes, talk about angry reviews. I've usually had a great experience at this location. The greeters are always friendly and seemingly want to be there. The service is relatively fast and the food is zesty and delicious. We usually order the 2-for-20 and enjoy guacamole dip and salsa before our entrees. It's a great deal. The servers are always friendly and there's never a wait. Really no complaints on my end!"}
{"text":"I'm not big on chains because everything always taste like it comes out of the frozen section aisle in the grocery store (unless it's Bonefish or Outback :) Chill's is no exception!  Just go for happy hour and bar food only .. maybe even just drinks, chips and salsa.  I got off work early last week and decide to grab 2 happy hour drinks at Chill's while I waited for a friend to get off work.  Besides myself there were 6 other people in the entire restaurant on a Thursday afternoon (3:30-4 ish).  I ordered the Presidente Margarita because the bartender told me how this one was so much better than the regular Margarita.  Nothing taste Presidential about the damn thing!  Cool .. I decided after my second sip that my next drink would be liquor, ice and lime.    Before my second drink I ordered the happy hour portion of Texas fries.  They look so good on the menu.  When I received mine however, they were old fries that were just sitting for a while, then thrown in the oven with cheese, bacon and peppers ... all the things I like but it seems they must have forgotten about the the Texas fries in the oven because the skillet was scorching hot but the fries taste old and the cheese was almost burnt and the bacon pieces were so hard that I just decided not to include any on my fork.  Bummer!  I followed by gut and ordered just a well Tequila, on the rocks with lots of lime.  I'll go back to Chill's for happy hour ONLY because it's across the street from job.  I wouldn't bother stopping in otherwise."}
{"text":"The wait staff was very slow and inattentive.   Considering most of the work is automated and pay at your table our waiter still took 10 min longer for my son's meal than the rest of us and then never checked on us after that. I was not happy with the service but the food is the same as any other chili's."}
{"text":"Not a fan of southwest style food so selection is limited but at least it's good I suggest the steak"}
{"text":"I had the pork tacos with chili and fries. The fries were ok, the tacis were not. Couldn't eat the second one. The chili was thin with very little taste. Requested salsa for my tacos and a thin tastless watery red substance was brought.    Tex mex my butt.. Wont come again. On a positive point, the service was ok."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. My coworkers and I had waited 15-20 at our table and even then we had to wave our hands to even catch the attention of a waitress to acknowledge our presence. After eating chips for another 15mins our orders all came out at different times. Then our drinks ran dry and we're not offered refills. So when we asked they never came. It took 45 mins to get 1 small salad to our table after all this, by then we were almost all done eating. Gabrielle was NOT attentive and this has been one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a Chilis"}
{"text":"The food was very good, but service was slow. It seems like they don't have enough staff, on the other hand we had 3 different servers. Not sure as to why.. but it was weird."}
{"text":"My experience could have been better here. Got a shared appetizer w/no plates. Waitress brought them 10min after our food arrived so that we could eat cold food. Ordered a margarita that Sat at the bar 15min before the waitress remembered to bring it so it was watered down.  Salad entree was okay. My kid ordered fajitas and the wraps came out 20min before the rest of her dinner?? Appetizer was cold in the middle so I'll probably never come here again. I really hate paying for meals w/below mediocre service."}
{"text":"We always enjoy going to this chilis location seems to be busy no matter what time we go there. I do have to say the Happy Hour selections are amazing and we have always had a good experience. Last night we had Kayla as our bartender and she was very amazing... Friendly and checked up on us constantly without being overbearing. Overall highly recommend this chilis location. Thanks for being awesome!!"}
{"text":"I recently went to this Chili's for lunch and being lunch it was fairly busy. I ordered the bacon ranch quesadilla and after a couple of bites there was this nasty hard stuff in the quesadilla. My waitress didn't come check on me for a long time so I just sat there making faces. Finally, the manager was checking on the table next to mine, saw my face and asked if everything was alright. I showed him the hard plastic like pieces in the quesadilla and at first he tried to say it was burnt cheese. He leaves to get my waitress after I bang it on the table to show him it's not burnt cheese. The waitress comes over and says \"well what do you want us to do?\". I tell her I just want my bill so I can leave. The only reason they are getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because when she came back they comped my quesadilla, so I paid for my drink and left and won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"I will never go to this chilies again.  The big fat stinky waiter that brought me my food I would swear he farted as he was sending me my food"}
{"text":"I frequent this location often as a great place to get a quick lunch that is not \"fast food\".  Today however I think was not a great experience.  The food was ok, but the service was lacking.  Placed our order for express lunch promptly along with order for water to drink.  Had to ask another server after 10 minutes if we could get our water and chips and salsa. She brought them to us.  After another 10 minutes our lunch arrived I wondered if our waiter thought our drinks had magically appeared.  Unfortunately this set the pace for the remainder of lunch, wait and ask for the check, ask for the waiter to cash out, etc."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on here, I was surprised to say it was really a great experience.  Our waiter and the food was great.  All the food was hot and the restaurant was very clean.  Would definitely recommend for those visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Chilli's is always a good place whether it's your primary destinatio or your backup. The one out on Signal Butte gets pretty packed during the lunch and dinner hours because there's not very many sit down restaurants in the immediate vicinity."}
{"text":"So honestly im done with this location. I come here all the time with my family or son, love the food mostly but the service there is the worst ! Everytime i come it takes atleast 15 minutes or so to even get talked to ! The days i come with my son is even worse, server always seems like they just want to get our food in and never come by to check on us. They may look at me like im a young guy not going to tip well, even though i work for the industry i tip very well !! Definitely wont be coming to this location anymore and neither will my family.!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst location ever.  The first time I went there I sat at the bar and the server never even acknowledged me.  I finally went to be seated in the main dining room.  I decided to give them another try and the service was just as bad.  The third  (and final) time my sister and I went on margarita day.  The first server at the bar mixed the perfect margarita.  The 2nd sever gave me some pre mixed concoction that was undrinkable.  I ordered the fried pickles and could not eat them.   The breading kept falling off.   Needless to say that I will not be returning to that location again."}
{"text":"Service and food were poor quality. Limp salad and the hottest wings tasted like bbq sauce. Won't be going back. The waitress obviously doesnt like her job."}
{"text":"Food is decent, but portions are small for the price. We sat in the bar so we could get happy hour food prices, only to find out that the happy hour drink prices last all day, but the food goes back to regular price at 6. (We sat down at 5:55 and they didn't take our order soon enough to get the discount.   Since I have issues with gluten, my choices were limited. This surprises me this day in age at a chain restaurant. I ended up ordering the smoked wing appetizer. They were actually very tasty, but was a very small portion in relation to the price. My husband ordered a salad, although his portion was small also."}
{"text":"I ordered online and picked up the order at 11:15, right after they opened.  The food was put together and waiting for me.  All utencils, condiments and even napkins were included in the bag.  I paid online and was able to leave a tip online, so I was in and out in less than a minute.  Very pleased with the experience.  Food was still warm when I got home and was delicious!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Will never go back to this particular chili's. First off, the server put the extremely hot skillets directly right in front of my baby sitting in a high chair. Not near, DIRECTLY IN FRONT. I'm sorry but that should be common sense since its so hot. I had to say something cause she kept doing it. Also there was crumbs on my side of the table as we sat down, not sure if they didnt care to clean it or just did a horrible job. Then our check was completely wrong and we were charged double on multiple items. The waitress couldn't figure it out for her life so the manager came said he would fix it. He NEVER came back. I did see him however arguing with an employee. He even questioned us when we told him why are the wontons full price? He said I don't think there part of Happy hour and we told him they were and he said he'd have to check. You think a manager would know their menu better. I'm upset he never came back and never apologized. So our waitress came back after forever with our new checks and they were still completely wrong! They only took 6 dollars off for their mistakes when there was much more. They were so slow and so ignorant we ended up leaving and paying a dessert that was supposed to be free with points, an order of fries we never ordered and a skillet that wasn't on happy hour because the waitress didn't understand what we asked for. It was an awful experience and we tried being friendly about it but when the waitress cuts you off everytime you try to explain and the manager doesn't give a crap, makes me not want to be understanding and nice. Also we all woke up this morning sick with killer stomach aches,  just a heads up for people looking to eat here, a drive to another chili's is what I'd recommend."}
{"text":"A good spot to eat a calm, relaxing breakfast if you have time.  The tables away from the bar minimizes the outside sounds.    Its expensive compared to Denny's but the serving size validates the cost.  The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I gave this 2 stars only because I got a refill of my drink.  Outside of that this place is terrible.  Food is gross and service is barely passable.    Note to owner:  Are you losing money?  Maybe you should try the food.  After that I think you'll figure where your investment is going."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely horrible.  We sat with empty drinks for thirty minutes, received the wrong food items, and then waited another twenty minutes for the check and change.  Our server seemed disinterested in our table and more interested in being in the kitchen.  All in all we ended up sitting for two hours in the restaurant for mediocre food and service.  Although he did not deserve it we did leave a small tip but it will be the last of our hard earned money that this company sees for a very long time.  It would also be nice if the company would stick to a menu and stop changing items every month."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar on New Year's Day to use a gift card. The Bartender gave good service but the food runner was not friendly at all. As for the food, it was not up to par. The southwestern egg rolls were good as they are at any Chilis I've been to. The beef tacos did not have seasoning. The beans that came with the tacos were cold and the rice was under cooked. We don't frequent Chilis a lot but this by far was the worst one food wise. We heard others complaining about cold beans as well. Their beer cooler was also broken and they had only two beers on draft. Unless I get another gift card here I won't go back."}
{"text":"My friends and I were staying in the Aria across the street and decided to go to Chili's for dinner before the Blue Man Group show.  We arrived around 7:15 and were told that it would be a 15 minute wait for a group of 4 people. The place looked dead so we didn't understand the wait. We ended up being seated in a booth where half of it was open and facing the people waiting for a table. Slightly awkward eating your food with people watching you and waiting for their own table. Our waitress was nice, but it seemed like the service was just SLOW. It took 20 minutes just to get our appetizers (pretzel sticks and chips and dip). One of my friend's order came out wrong. And when we wanted our check, we had to flag down someone else to get it. We got charged full price for the appetizers instead of the Happy Hour price like we were told at the beginning. Then we went to the bar separately to get to-go drinks and THAT took another 15 minutes to make 3 drinks (a cosmo and 2 margaritas). At this point it was 9:00 pm and the place still seemed kind of dead... So we were still wondering why the service was slow.   So much for going early enough to eat before our show. We got to the theater right before the doors opened. It should not take 2 hours to get 3 drinks, 2 appetizers, and 2 entrees (travel time walking to the restaurant and back not included)."}
{"text":"Walked into this Chili's this evening, April 14, 2017, and walked right back out less than 10 minutes later. We were seated right away, my lady placed her beverage order (margarita) and that came approx 3 minutes later. I noticed how sticky the table was, so I got a napkin and her sanitizer. Lo and behold, some bullshit appeared on the napkin. We closed the menus, and advised them that we would be leaving. They asked \"why\" in a concerning tone, so I showed them how clean their tables aren't! Disgusting!! The manager acted appalled as well. How could you NOT notice how dirty the tables are, when you work here and are constantly \"wiping\" them down. The napkin looked like I wiped the bottom of my Vans after walking through old car oil. No bueno!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time EVER at Chili's and overall the food was good but the service and wait time Was horrible"}
{"text":"First time here.. it was kind of like applebbes.. but had nachos though. refilled water twice.. and gave me the wrong guac!! I wanted tableside guac!! But oh well.. gave me my extra sauce I requested so yeah."}
{"text":"WOW....not sure how I can say this OTHER THAN receiving the worst customer service and chose to make it extremely clear by leaving zero tip. 3 days later I found my waitress had added herself a tip. Called and spoke to a manager who pulled my original ticket and saw the increase after the fact. She was horrified and eluded to this was a terminable offense. I am going to file a police report as well for fraudulent activity. How stupid can you be to lose your job over $1.56??? Keep your receipts and watch and balance your checking accounts. I hate to think how many people she may have scammed!! Shame on her!!!"}
{"text":"Soggy nachos, dry and crunchy boneless wings, NOT impressed. Currently watching our waitress behind the partition doing menial task while we've been waiting ten minutes for her to return."}
{"text":"Not sure why this location has such a low overall star rating but I found the staff to be friendly, the place to be clean (including the bathroom) and wait time wasn't too bad for a Saturday night (only 15 mins). Overall we (my husband and I) were pretty happy just wish the waitress was a little more on top of things...she did say she was new to town and that location so she didnt have knowledge of certain things just yet regarding that particular location."}
{"text":"Never again!  Veterans Day and you treat a vet like that and his friends.  Food that took forever except the appetizers.  Almost an hour for food to have it come out cold.  I had to go find the manager and complain.  There was hardly anyone when we went in and this was completely unacceptable!!!  Our waiter was the only cool guy."}
{"text":"I visit here frequently for lunch since I work close by. Love the variety! I usually just do take out and Mandy is usually my cashier, and sometimes another gentleman, tall, blonde, very polite (I cannot remember his name) I love them both! Always so sweet and patient with me and all of my condiment requests. The food is 99.9% good. Sometimes the fries are off their game. Otherwise, overall satisfied with my visits! :)"}
{"text":"It's a Chili's-what's more to say? I'm an anti chain restaurant kind of girl so when my friends suggested going to Chili's last week, I winced a bit.  But the Chili's experience was a good one-even for a Friday night when parking was scarce. They have a 2 for $20 menu where you and another person can split an appetizer and  each get an entree--not too shabby. We got the guacamole to start with and after experiencing it at authentic Mexican places, it was a bit weak. I got the Margarita Grilled Chicken and the portion was huge! I had a few bites then had to take the rest home since I was so full from chips, guac and salsa. Ok and a $3.49 margarita which to my surprise was quite strong. One of my favorite things about Chili's is that if you get the chips and salsa appetizer they will gladly put some chips in a to go bag for you so you don't even have to stop at Target for chips."}
{"text":"Had not been here in years and thought I would give it a shot. Place has been remodeled with a great look and new menus and waitress was very friendly unfortunately those are the only positives . The water tastes like it came from old rusting pipes, beef fajitas are tough as leather boot and tortillas are cool. Kicking myself now that I didn't go to the Chipotle 1/4 mile away. I would avoid this place unless you are looking to just have a drink. Food is no Bueno."}
{"text":"What can you say about Chilis... it's a Chili's! The menu has improved quite significantly though..."}
{"text":"Love this place, the staff is awesome. Brian and Eddie at the bar are the best. Margaritas, chips and everything on the menu is good. Prices are awesome and cant beat the location. Highly recommend this Chilis"}
{"text":"Had a late dinner last night around 9pm.  I ordered the new crispy chicken salad, which I thought from the pic was more like a spring mix (my bad for not asking), but it was mostly iceberg, which was extremely limp & looked pretty bad.  The waitress came back to ask how it was, where I normally wouldn't have even mentioned, I expressed my issues and she left for a minute & came back to replace the meal.  Although she wasn't a bad waitress, had she been an exceptional waitress, she would have asked if I would like the same item or something different, but a while later I received another salad, still with the same lettuce & still not looking great, but better than the first.  I did eat some of the lettuce & most of the chicken.  I paid the bill and went home only to start getting really bad stomach pains & then violently ill for at least a few hours.  Today still not feeling quite back to normal I decided to look up reviews and found someone earlier that day whose husband seemed to have had the same issue.  Don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"During my undergrad years, Chili's was our \"go to\" spot for happy Hour. They used to offer a free basket of wings, chips and salsa and $3 well drinks during happy hour.  Yes, you read that correctly.  Back in the day (2005-2007), Chili's in Chester, VA used to offer free wings, chips and salsa during happy hour.  Needless to say, I wore Chili's out.  Or maybe Chili's wore me out ... I won't say.  Fast forward to March 2018, I stopped in to Chili's for a quick happy hour while running errands.  I don't know how new the happy our menu is but right now, March 2018 they are featuring $5 Presidente Margaritas, $3 wells and appetizers for $3, 4 and 5 bucks.  I ordered a Presidente Margarita and a half order of the Texas fries.  I asked for them fresh and pippin hot because I remember ordered them back in the day and it appears I would always get an old order of fries with cheese barely melted on it.    It took no time for my order to come out and guess what ... the Texas Fries were hot and fresh.  The cheese was melted in between the fries, not just thrown on top.  There was plenty of green onions, bacon and flavor.  They were loaded with flavor.  I enjoyed the fries, my drink, the service and my time over all so much that I vowed to come back to try them for dinner.  I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the worst  Now I remember why I hadn't gone here in awhile. The food is horrible!!! The kitchen is a pigsty I can't imagine this restaurant staying in business  The one star is too good for this place!"}
{"text":"If I can give negative stars, i would. This is the worst restaurant ever. Waited for an hour and a half for our food then our server asked us if we wanna cancel our order. Who does that? and when the food came, still so many mistakes. Dont ever come here if you are just visiting."}
{"text":"Saturday night and cold Great Lakes Conway Irish Ale on draft under $6.  Good Santa Fe chicken soup on a chilly February eve.  Watching a few college ball games and listening to good music while conversing.  Great place. Great food.  Helpful staff."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, it was quiet and we had a very nice server. He was very polite and accommodated us, since we had a baby. Food came slightly cool, kids food was great. Problem, my Long Island ice tea was supposed to be top shelf liquors, I swear I couldn't find ANY liquor. Very disappointing, I usually enjoy one of these drinks & this tasted like horrible lemonade. They took it off our tab. Which was nice. Bartender needs to work on his drink skills."}
{"text":"Oh Chilli's the butt of so many jokes. But you are ok. Not too bad. They changed their menu mostly for the better. Remolded the restaurant to a much better modern look. I love the fried Jalapenos and the spicy onion strings app. Really good. Just spicy enough for me. The fajitas and the bacon ranch quesadilla are good. The chocolate molten cake is always a good dessert. So moist and chocolaty and good. For a cheap dinner or for apps and drinks with friends it is an ok place and the prices are good. Much better than that apple place in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday evening to dine in with my two daughters and niece. First time visiting this location. They sat us at a booth. That was a plus for me. Our server came right away. She was very pleasant. Smiled, and has a great attitude. She took our drink and food order. Brought chips and salsa out, while we waited. Food was great. Wait time waste long. My server Samantha gave prompt, efficient, and plain out perfect service. No complaints here at all. For the first time, in a very long time, i can actually say I got some damn GOOD service somewhere. I also work with food. I serve people everyday for a living. I know exactly how it should be done, and in my opinion, I'm darn good at it! So, for me to say this girl did everything perfect down to the T, is straight out mind blowing for me because I am very critical. Especially when I get served food. I did not have to ask for a refill, not once. Samantha did not even let any of our drinks get empty to the point where we had to ask for one. I loved her service. It takes someone special to be that observant. All the specifics/modifications on my entire order were exactly how I asked too. My kids noticed it. And we're very pleased too. On my way out I had to ask for the manager. There was no way I was leaving without letting him know about Samantha and her immaculate service. Great dining experience. Thank you ,Samantha. You rock!"}
{"text":"Here's a breakdown of my experience. 1. Empty restaurant and took 30 minutes to receive food. 2. Great cheese curds only good thing to say. 3. Ordered babyback ribs and there was absolutely NO meat on these things.  Basically just skin and sauce. 4. G/f ordered prime rib burrito and the plate was extremely hot but the burrito was luke warm at its hottest. 5. Service was just okay.  All in all I feel like Chili's is that restaurant you go to every 6 months because it takes about that long to forget about how crappy it is."}
{"text":"Shani is amazing!  I love how attentive she was to our group's needs!  I will come back just to see her!"}
{"text":"My waiter was amazing. I forget his name but he was such a sweetheart and so very nice! And handsome too. I was there last night on Father's Day about 8 with my family of four. He was so nice with the suggestions and offered me like literally everything. He constantly checked on us and refilled everything without being asked! What a gentleman. Anytime he'd ask me a question he would always wink at me too. Such a sweetie. The food was magnificent. The atmosphere was great. A bit busy but it was a holiday so it was expected. But I would highly recommended this location. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I bet a baby diaper that has been defecated in tastes better than this frozen food crap."}
{"text":"I don't why everyone is hating on chilis. They are a five star restaurant you peasants."}
{"text":"I don't usually eat at Chili's, but this time I was starving! I sat in the bar area and the bartender was very attentive. I had the Carnitas burrito in green sauce. It was the best damn burrito! It was full of flavor from the first bite to the last. It was served on a HOT plate that kept it at a nice temperature. Simply awesome! The bar staff was friendly and kept me in iced tea refills. I had the cheesecake with cherry sauce and that, also, was just delicious. Definately going back to this Chili's"}
{"text":"I love going to Chilis in NY but all the ones I have been to in AZ sucked until now.  Chilis in Mesa has redeemed themselves.   I went for a friends birthday and I was surprised to see the place was spottless, the service was great and the food taste good.   We ordered Loaded Queso, cheese bites and a southern burger with grass fed beef.  Food came out on time and was delicous.  The only jiccup was my burger was gooded well done when I wanted it med rare.  Our server, brittany and the manager was very attentive.  They were quick to recook our food amd even offered us soup/salad while we wait.  We are only human so it is never aboit the mistake, only how you redeem yourself after the mistake."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and dinner during my trip. The service is extremely SLOW, and they don't listen very well as the orders at Lunch we're wrong. Having one server for the entire bar side of the restaurant is poor management. I feel sorry for the guy that was busting his butt."}
{"text":"Good food. Great service.  Ask for Waitress Aimee ~ she was friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times, food is always decent/consistent.  Service is not outstanding day in and day out. However, our last visit there, service was EXCEPTIONALLY BAD. Bartender appeared to be over-tasked. She was running food in the dining room and spent an extensive amount of time in the kitchen instead of tending to the guests. While we were sitting there with empty (alcoholic) beverages for a period of time, the manager proceeded to stand around and then walk over and sit in a booth (in bar area) with his buddy instead of putting guests first. Unfortunately, that was the last straw and we will not be going back or recommending this particular location to any of our companions."}
{"text":"One star for the service we received today. Our waiter was completely rude! On the check the serve name was Sayra. When she was taking our order for a party of 4 she said, \"oh maybe I should write this down\". Really? That's probably why she forgot to bring us our salad. She was rushed to leave elsewhere and the restaurant was empty. She was a total witch. Slammed our foods on the table and our receipts. ZERO TIP!!"}
{"text":"We have NO complaints here! Our orders are always correct. Our favorite appetizers are the queso and the chipotle chicken crispers. My absolute favorite entree is the bacon ranch chicken quesadilla. Extra sour cream!! My fiancé orders a bunch of different stuff, and we are never disappointed. The wait is never long, even when it's busy! We usually stop at the mall before or after we eat, convenient!"}
{"text":"First time going to this particular chilis. Seems about the same as any other except they were out of veggie burgers. First time that's happened in many years of ordering it at every chilis I've ever been to. Not a great first impression."}
{"text":"Hey it's a Chili's.  What can you expect?  We get seated immediately; we always choose the bar area because of the happy hour deals.  After 9 PM the appetizers are also half off.  What I kind of dislike about the Chili's brand now (and this is not just limited to this one location) is the introduction of the \"Ziosk\".  The at-table tablet that allows you to basically order and pay from your table, nearly eliminating the experience and interaction with a server.  I'm not a fan, but I can see how to some it would be convenient."}
{"text":"This is probably one of our favorite places to eat. We are frequent visitors for dinner. The food is always good, though the menus change frequently. I can't wait to try the salted caramel melting cake and hope the still have it when I go in next."}
{"text":"We thought we would try this restaurant even though the reviews weren't all that great. When we walked in the floor was dirty, it felt a little grimy. The waitstaff was nice and friendly. But the food was just mediocre. Service was slow but eventually I did get a refill on my drink. It just took a while."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful service from Christopher! Five dollars margaritas with a kick! Great food and I am truly surprised I see a negative review here. Many lunch and dinner specials! Liked the warm chips but salsa was just ok. Christopher thank you for such friendly service! Your parents raised you right!"}
{"text":"Food was made fast and it was delicious. The service was so quick and friendly. Jason (our server) was amazing. Put us in an instant good mood. Love em!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the quesdillas at Chili's. Try their happy hour where they offer bottled and draft beers. There chicken tenders are okay but they are breaded and I do not care for breaded chicken tenders but rather the grilled ones which they do not offer. The salsa here is not very good, I have tasted store bought salsa that tastes much better. The best thing Chili's has to offer is the happy hour."}
{"text":"Pitiful. Walked in with 2 young baseball players at 9pm. Was told the regular seating was closed, but we could sit in the lounge. Sit down, waited for about 10 minutes no one came over to even say hello, or offer drinks. It wasn't busy at all, So we left. . The location on West Charleston is 5 star in my book, this one is a joke restaurant full of people who don't want to work."}
{"text":"I don't live near a Chili's so I don't frequent them often.  We were across the street at the swap meet so we decided to run in for lunch.  I will say there are no vegetarian options on the menu which is a pain.  I ordered the Guacamole for us and it was surprisingly good for a chain.  I also ordered a  quesadilla salad minus the chicken which turned out to be better than you would expect.  Our waitress was very nice, but she really assumed we had eaten there before and we were all confused by the weird menu.  Everything seems to be ordered in multiples of 3 or 2.  I guess their thing is to configure your own meal.  If you don't frequent Chili's I guess you should let them know before you order."}
{"text":"We always have great service and the food is always perfect. You truly can't beat the prices either. It's affordable and always clean!"}
{"text":"My family has been going to this particular chili's since it opened.  For the most part he have had good service but to fight was the BEST!   Everyone was so helpful to each other and we're enjoying themselves. It was a pleasant dinner sigh my 8 year old"}
{"text":"I ordered Chili's to-go on Saturday night. The person I spoke with was friendly and took her time and I didn't feel rushed.  She said it would be ready in 15 minutes and I got there in 20.  My order was ready and the staff were very nice. The transaction was quick and I was out of there in no time.  The fajitas and the Margarita Chicken was delicious. It was fresh.  I had made additional requests for extra tortillas, honey mustard instead of ranch, and guacamole. Everything was there. I am very satisfied with my experience."}
{"text":"I've been to other mediocre Chili's in Phoenix, but this location is my favorite. The bar looks like it's been recently remodeled and has a cool modern vibe. I love the padded, high-backed barstools and we've only experienced friendly bartenders who know better than to rush you through your meal.  I LOVE the blackberry margarita (and I'm not even a big marg drinker) and the chicken enchilada soup (I add extra lime to mine). The sliders were so-so, but for five bucks (happy hour), what the heck."}
{"text":"Had to change previous 2 star review to 1 star. Service was bad. Food not so great either. Server argued about taking our order with another waitress. We waited for her to sweep her section before coming over to take order (20 mins). Brought food and drinks, but that was it. Had to get up and ask greeter for iced tea refill and daughter never got her refill. Had to ask another person after waiting 30 mins for the check.    Fajitas where mostly oiled onions. Chicken was soft but over time got to be rubbery.   Went to support their commitment to Pediatric Cancer and St Jude's (my son current fighter). She didn't take out donation or allow us to buy the St Jude fundraiser items... I was in such a hurry to get out... I even forgot.   Been to other locations, with great food and service. Just won't waste time and money at this location."}
{"text":"We used to go to this Chili's a lot because it's right in our neighborhood.  The service and food used to be pretty good.  For the last six months or so, the service has been terrible.  Last night, we went in for the last time.  We sat at a table for 15 minutes and were never even acknowledged by any staff person, so we got up and left.  Actually, no one even noticed that we left either!  That's pretty bad!  This place will get no more of my business!"}
{"text":"There were many hick-ups with our meals, To start off with they only had water or unsweetened/flavored tea's because their soda machine was broke. We ordered 1 waters, my husbands glass had lipstick lips still on it, mine had black stuff floating in it. So we get fresh drinks, the waitress apologized for the dirty glasses, we ordered our meals, when they come i dig into my potatoes and find a hair in my food, i get the waitress attention she again apologizes for the food, she asks do i want to keep my steak or a new one, i opted for a new steak as i would probably be looking for hairs in the steak as well. The manager came out apologized for all the trouble we have had, told me they were making my food fresh asked if i would like a salad while i waited and comped my meal. Even after all the issues i rated my experience based off of the customer service, then the food, they took care of the issue and saved our expeirce"}
{"text":"Oversalted, overcooked and underwhelming portions.   We ordered the $17 ribs and it came out looking like jerky- when I took a bite, I wished it was. The salmon was crunchy (not in a nice way) and inedible and the rice was undercooked. Rice-A-Roni from a box tastes better. They put salt in almost everything, it seems, to make up for zero flavoring. Their broccoli was clearly boiled and the only thing served despite the \"steamed vegetables\" description.   Everything was so poorly prepared and they were clearly cutting on quality that I am never going back to ANY Chili's restaurant- it's just not worth the high cost to dine there and get garbage.   Oh and they also automatically charge $.99 for \"Tableside\" entertainment, a tiny tablet on a podium where you can place your order, play some games, and pay your bill. I didn't even touch the thing, except to move it aside and we were charged. I guess the only upside to the visit was that when we told the server to remove it from the bill, he did."}
{"text":"I give them 1 star for atmosphere.  We went in yesterday and place was fairly empty.  We asked for a booth, hostess response was \" I think we can do that\". Then we order, I said no ranch dressing and dressing on side. Order comes and mine is drenched in ranch. Waitress didn't even notice! So, I send back but she leaves other person's meal. Was other person supposed to eat their's? or wait until everyone is served?  We don't eat until everyone is served. It is extremely rude to do so.  5 mins pass and my meal comes, my friend's meal (pasta) is now ice cold.  Not interested in our meals at that point. We offered to pay for our drinks and left. Cook should of checked meals! waitress double checked and when a meal goes back the whole table goes back to stay warm."}
{"text":"If i could give this place zero star i would. Was sat for near 10 mins and not one of the staffs were willing to take order after flagging down three of them. So I said fk this place and left. Thx for wasting 10 mins of my time ."}
{"text":"A solid Chili's. I've never had a bad experience there. It's nothing exceptional, but I think that is what's nice about it, you know exactly what to expect. Wait staff is very pleasant."}
{"text":"One of the best family dinning experiences we have had since living here. I have gone 3 times in the past 2 weeks because of the great service at this location! Very friendly and super accommodating! Plus the food each time has been amazing! Especially the mango-chili chicken!  We'll be back soon! Thanks if the good times!"}
{"text":"This is the most ridiculous restaurant experience I've EVER had. $127 for 4 watered down, premix margaritas?!?!?! On top of the insane \"surprise\" prices, the drinks are barely 9-10 ounces and further watered down with ice. On the entire menu, the margaritas are the ONLY item that don't have the prices listed. I expect airport prices, however, this was robbery!!!! And trickery! At the very, very least, publish the prices on the menu!!!!!  DO NOT EAT OR DRINK IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT."}
{"text":"So everybody knows I pretty much only eat at Chillis out of desperation. But I found 2 awesome things here. 1. Gotta get the skillet cookie. Omg. It looks and taste like the picture - when does that ever happen? Cause I  can't say the same for the chipotle ribs... The cookie though - best thing I ever ate.. At Chills. 2. Jacob, my waiter. He made my entire experience phenomenal! Again, when does that ever happen? Rare. I'd go back for those two things alone! Next time you go, ask for Jacob and tell'em I sent ya ;)"}
{"text":"We came to Chili's instead of Macoroni Grill because my girlfriend received a gift certificate from her work and we had the choice between the two. Needless to say we made the absolute wrong decision. My girlfriend ordered a 6oz Sirloin with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. I ordered the mix and match combo with a half rack of ribs, steamed broccoli, and mashed potatoes. The ribs were served cold, the mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box, and neither one of our steaks had any flavor whatsoever. The best part of the meal was the broccoli, how pathetic is that. The only reason I am giving this place 2 is our Bartender Malissa is a Rockstar! If we ever go back to Chili's it will be to belly up to the bar and drink adult beverages served by Malissa. Great service, terrible food!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Chili's in many years I was very impressed with my experience. All of our food was great and our service was awesome! I really wasn't expecting that from Chili's. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  The server had a very bad attitude after we asked if we could have mashed potatoes instead of fries on a special.  The manager was not willing to make any accommodation, so we just decided to leave."}
{"text":"Server was friendly but slow. My order was wrong but he tried very hard to get it fixed. Nothing was wrong with my moms order (go her -___-)"}
{"text":"It took them 20 minutes to grab me a menu, I understand that they were busy but still 20 minutes, the food was ok nothing special,  I am not sure in would go back ever again"}
{"text":"This Chili's was Terrible! My steak was awful. My wife's Shrimp was really bad.The rice was dry and had no flavor.The soup tasted like canned soup.Our dessert was dry and over cooked.I won't be back any time soon! Not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"We had the BEST experience in the bar tonight. It was very busy and with just ONE server for the whole bar. But, boy could this kid hustle. All of his tables were attended to in a timely fashion, drinks were never empty and he could hold a genuine conversation despite the business. He did not come across stressed or anything. Austin - best employee they have."}
{"text":"Very clean chills. One of the best I've been at in the USA. They are very nice people and they are very curious if you have any issues. Thumbs up for a great staff and a great place"}
{"text":"This place was a joke...on our way home from a weekend in Vegas to grab a bite before we hit the road home. Biggest mistake ever! Our service was the worst I have ever had. The server took about 10 mins to come out and greet us to get our drink order. After the order was taken it took about 45 mins until our food hit the table, we ordered salads, boneless wings, soup and a burger. I'm sure it doesn't take this long for that stuff to come out of the kitchen. While waiting we had to walk to the back of the kitchen to ask for refills and status on food as the manager was in the back talking to the one cook. Finally we get our food and my burger had 4 French fries on the plate and all the food was cold. Once we got the serves attention after 10 mins of not seeing her anywhere she explained they ran out of fry. I told her it was unacceptable to send a plate out to a table looking like that..she then began to explain that it's not her fault because the regional manager refuse to hire more people and that they force the managers to cook and serve...I had to tell her I really didn't care and just wanted my food fixed and hot. I had to asked to speak to the manager 3 times before coming out after 10 mins of waiting. After i expressed my concerns she just stood there looking at me like I was gonna give her detention. I felt bad cause it seemed this happened all the time and it was nothing new to her but knew she was unable to fix the issues herself. The manager comped my meal (salad) but that was the only meal comped although my party of 6 all had awful food. I hope this helps their employees reach out to management that there are issues that need to be fixed. I'll never return to that location ever again."}
{"text":"I hate giving restaurants bad reviews but I do this only as hope it will hear them in a better direction.   The food was fantastic.   The service left a lot to be desired. It was a slow evening and yet my servers never came by to check on us once. Dropped the food and ran. We ordered dessert from the electronic ordering machine on the table and waited 45 mins. Never came out. Someone walked by from the wait staff and we mentioned it. It then came out, was practically thrown on the table at us without even an apology for waiting so long for it.   We left disappointed and will probably not return until I see better reviews. And as much as I hate not leaving the normal 20% tip I left a much lower one.   I could see if they were busy but they really weren't and had plenty of staff working.   Please get your act together."}
{"text":"Should have listened to all the other horrible reviews. I get the same thing every time I go to Chili's for probably 15 years now. The food was very hot (right out of the fryer); however, not that good. The chicken crispers had more fat and tendon than meat and were far greaser than normal, the southwest egg rolls barely had any filling, and the avocado ranch appeared to be missing the avocado (asked server if I got the correct dip and she confirmed it was the avocado ranch). And my $8 Long Island contained only trace amounts of alcohol...."}
{"text":"This chili's is awful! Ordered curbside pickup at about 1030 to be ready by 1215. Get there at 1215 and 10 minutes roll by and no one comes out with my food. I call and the girl said she would bring it right out. Had to wait another 5 minutes and she apologized. I was furious because I only have a 30 minute lunch and by the time I got to work, I had to clock in already. Isnt that the point of curbside pickup?? I open my box of food and am immediately pissed off again. I ordered honey chipotle chicken crispers with loaded potatoes and street corn NO CILANTRO. Well my potatoes seemingly turned into French frys and theres cilantro on my corn and my chicken is cold?! Ughhh what a waste of $18. Never coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst chilis to ever eat at. Staff members sitting around in the bar watching the football game on new years took ourselves to refill our own ice teas up. Waiter came around barley while others were sitting at bar watching the football game."}
{"text":"I was completely ignored when i walked in. Then greeted by an employee who completely walked away and abandoned my order at the to-go area. The female manager was completely rude. The only reason I ever got any food was because the server Jason was an angel."}
{"text":"Stopped by with a friend to watch the 6th game of the World Series.  Had the loaded nachos with beef which were indeed loaded.  Delicious and plentiful. Also had the Bottomless chips, soup and salad.  Needless to say bottomless meant as much as I could eat which didn't turn out to be much.  You see, the chips were SO warm, and crispy and delicious that I couldn't stop eating them.  So by the time I got the soup and salad, I was done.  Took the rest home for a snack.  Sara, dressed in a cat Halloween costume, provided excellent  service.  I would definitely return here."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to a Chili's in years so decided to try their new menu.  Ended up with the Southern BBQ burger for granddaughter and the Endless Soup and Salad for me.  Soup and Salad sounded great  since I wasn't in the mood for meat. The BBQ burger came with delicious fries (I was allowed to taste one) and the bacon on the burger was to die for.  (I also begged to taste the bacon.)  As part of the Endless Soup and Salad, I chose the salad of mixed greens with sprinkles of queso fresco and the baked potato soup.  The salad was fresh and ample.  The soup came in a bowl which was about half full.  (See photo).  I finished the soup and the salad so I asked for portion number two.  For the second order, the soup was cold and served in a small ramekin type of \"bowl\" (see second photo) and a salad that was as ample as the first one.  So the soup portion got smaller when I asked for seconds, hmmmm.   Does that mean that if I asked for more soup, (remember it's Endless Soup and Salad) that the next soup portion would be served in a thimble??  Just saying.   I enjoyed the soup, enjoyed the fresh salad and my granddaughter loved her burger.   Chili's you had 5 stars until you tried to get cheap with your endless soup.  If I had gotten a normal portion to begin with, I wouldn't have asked for more.   Nice food, good prices, Chili's but don't get silly with your endless soup and salad portions otherwise don't offer it."}
{"text":"Bartender gave me my beer only a little over 3/4 full. I showed her & gave her a look, how about filling the glass. She said the foam head went down & it's Chili's policy to not fill it back up & she said it with an attitude."}
{"text":"Though this isn't a go-to, we do enjoy Chili's.  Our service the last visit was nothing to write Yelp about, but I found a new love - their chicken tortilla soup was better than everything else I ate!  It is absolutely delicious!  My burger was just eh, the fries are ok, and the children's meal was a huge portion.  But I will be back for that soup, mmmmmm!"}
{"text":"I am giving this chili's four stars, and have no problem at all giving this place and especially the waitress Jess great review!  Got the two for $20 with app. I upgraded to the 10 oz steak, wife got the carnitas fajitas platter. And it was great!   Beats the generic competition easily. Beats trying to make it at home. I and the wife both agreed the service, the food, the place itself, beat most if the \"genuine\" tex-mex places round here.  I got the steak, rare, came out perfectly prepared. Wife got the carnitas fajita platter. It was tender tasty, and had a \"tower'o'condiments\" with it.  Total price, with steak upgrade, beer, and tip, $38.  About what I would have spent on a single dinner at the teppanyaki place I was planning on going to.  And another shout out to Jess, and the rest of the staff.  Back of house and front. I hadn't eaten at a Chili's in over four years. I am going here, instead of Snapplebees or TGI-Food, here on out.  Better than I thought it would be, VERY happy I came here. Pix to follow..."}
{"text":"We like Chili's and unfortunately this location was a let down! Service was less than stellar and the bar area was very dirty. Floor was covered in trash and the bar itself was a mess covered in crumbs and empty plates. There were people sitting at the bar that were clearly irritated after waiting for ten minutes just to get a drink. Our food also took longer than normal. Would not back to this location again! We prefer the location on Eastern!!"}
{"text":"One of the best chillies I've been to. Especially in North Carolina, very friendly staff which is a total plus to me! If you are sitting at the bar ask for haley, stacy or Doug and tell them John Sent you!"}
{"text":"Review of \"to go\" only....  I ordered the 2/$20 deal on the Chili's app (which by the way is great!...easy to use; you can place your order with the app and pay with it too!). We got an appetizer and 2 entrees with sides for the 2/$20 deal. It was a good amount of food for the money. The food was delicious. The order was ready when I arrived 20 minutes after placing the order. The bartender was friendly (pick up the order at the bar).   The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it could be made better by delivering the food to my car. Applebee's does something similar called \"carside to go\" but I definitely prefer the taste of Chili's better. Sometimes you just don't want to get out of the car :)"}
{"text":"Awful. Food tasted like a frozen microwave meal. Way too expensive for what it was.  Halfway through our meal, people sitting across from us walked out after finding mold throughout their salad. Their quote to manager after she offered to comp meal was, \"You couldn't pay me to eat here.\" My thought now...you couldn't pay me to ever eat there again! Goodbye Chili's!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were given bad service! First of all we weren't offered chips n salsa. We didn't order an appetizer just ordered dinner. I ordered the marqarita Tex mex bowl. I asked for no black beans!! We seemed to have to wait a while..not having chips n salsa at all! She brought part of my husband's fajitas n then disappeared. She came back n said my meal was made with the black beans. She said it was being remade. She came back a few minutes later with it. It was very good!! She didn't check on us. She came back once. Asked for a refill that was it. She just didn't seem to care. With a fake smile. The server behind us was very attentive n seemed to know how to do his job.  She didn't get a very nice tip."}
{"text":"Super greasy and very rare fajitas. Won't eat them and won't go back... it was chilis to go that i ordered online...  that \"steak\" that had the texture of a roast is going to get someone sick..."}
{"text":"Wow so impressed with the new management.  I love this restaurant's menu. But over the years this one in particular wasn't good at all.  But the last two visit at the restaurant were more than good. Fresh and very well presented food. Great service with I guess excellent administration.  I recommend 100%."}
{"text":"My service was really very good.. Who does not love that.. I have to admit that my food was really good. The chips and dip my son really loved.  Over all pretty darn good. I liked my Margarita as well it was really good."}
{"text":"Wow! In the service business and very disappointed with our overall experience. It took 10 minutes to be greeted. The hostess took our drink order. It took another 20 minutes to get my very expensive house wine (the wine cost more than the meals). We finally got our food at the 35 minute mark. Though the food mediocre; the only reason we gave place a two star is because of the hostess was busting her butt .... bussing tables, seating the customers, and getting some drink orders. The manager didn't seem to care one bit when we brought our concerns to his attention. They have a captured audience; otherwise, they would be out of business!"}
{"text":"Unless you are obsessed with faux Tex Mex food, I would stay away from Chili's. My meal was pretty good, even if the service was somewhat subpar, but the electronic device they have on each table told me I could play trivia in 16 seconds (and ask my friends, I loves me some trivia). I hit okay, and it told me I had unlimited access for the next 24 hours. I hit okay again, and then it told me I was being charged $2 to play.  I immediately cancelled, but I had to ask the waitress twice to remove the charge from my final bill.  You can find better food pretty much anywhere and you don't have to worry about the restaurant trying to con you out of a few extra dollars. Screw you, Chili's!"}
{"text":"1st time trying the combo meal the food could have been  little hotter the server was excellent,"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. I normally am patient and a fair reviewer, and I try to be understanding. However, during this visit, it was probably 3/4 full, and we were made to wait for a table. Not only that but when a table was \"available\" they took someone who literally walked in the door. However, that was ok because a customer came to the front to ask the hostess if someone helped him because no one has taken their order, and they've been seated for 40 minutes. So we got up and walked across the parking lot where they could sit within 10 minutes. Funny thing is a couple that was waiting with us did the same thing."}
{"text":"First off I can't stand most chain restaurants as I view them no different than pulling into a fast food chain it's all about quantity over quality.   My wife is a fan of this restaurant so we went and took our 4 year old son and it was terrible from the start.   We sat down and didn't see a waiter for almost 15 minutes then when he came he asked us what we wanted to drink we order margaritas and water and he brought back the margaritas but NO WATER not to mention he brought frozen margaritas first and we ordered regular margaritas.   My son had a pizza that was burnt and I ordered ribs that came out cold as if they was sitting out and they put sauce on them and served. Instead of the waiter bring out a fresh batch of ribs he brought out a empty plate took my ribs and reheated them while most restaurants would of cooked a new order.   My wife had fajitas and that seems to be the only thing that came out decent and that was because of the steaming hot platter it comes out on.   Overall the service was terrible the total wait time to get our meal was 45 min and this is what you call a family friendly restaurant ?   Even the host was bad she was missing when we came in and once she got back it took her 5-10 mins to notice that we was a new arrival. Oh never mind she put us in the bar area with liquor even though it was clear that we had a small 4 year old child with us. smh   I wouldn't advise anyone to visit the Northlake location it's far too many other restaurants in the area and if this wasn't a franchise chain it would be closed I'm sure."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to this location in some time as last time the wife and I did the service was 'substandard' for lack of a better term.  No worries this time, four members of the waitstaff passed us by, looked our table over but wouldn't acknowledge us over an 11 minute period, even to say that they were busy or \"be with you momentarily\"... so we got up to leave. If it were packed and busy, I'd have given more leeway.   Upon letting the 'manager', host or whoever the duo at the front were, the response was less than enthusiastic. Nice.  Outback is next door, they're service is fine."}
{"text":"Our server Logan went above and beyond!! He was so friendly, had great knowledge of the menu! We would come back just for him!!"}
{"text":"Poor for a chain!!! Like drama? Wsnt to hear servers argue, discussion of whos tickets are short so they worked for free, this is the place. Want a server that reeks of smoke and tries  to cover it....yum. A manager that stands next to you and can't even say hello, how the food.......this is the place. Then I got to hear them comlain about the tip another person  left. Not sure why the even did other than it being a holiday. Food was average chain, service and atmosphere suck."}
{"text":"ughh....The only reason why I went here was that the burgers were the same price as they were charging at the nearby burger king. The food has to be better, right??? Since our flight was semi-delayed, we ordered from the take out window. Fearing an overcooked burger, I asked that my burger be done medium rare..\"we dont do medium rare, the best I can do is medium-well\"...uh huh... while my $11 nuked burger tasted like crap, the fries weren't too bad and was still better than the burger king... Why does airport food have to be so bad??why god why?????"}
{"text":"love the food, drinks are good, best during happy hour at the bar, house wine only $3.74 and their fried pickles are great"}
{"text":"Good place to go for a quick and simple lunch. Typical chain restaurant nothing special."}
{"text":"Went here for a weekday lunch. Place seemed understaffed even though it wasn't busy at all. Lots of waiting to be seated, waiting for service, waiting to get our check.  (Our table and the table on either side of us all had empty ketchup bottles; that's a reflection of either their food quality or their attention to detail.)  The restaurant itself is nicely laid out, with several areas of tables/booths, and a bar area that nicely divides the areas to keep the place from feeling like one big warehouse space.  Our food wasn't bad but wasn't good, either (hence the two-star rating). I had bacon chicken avocado sandwich on pretzel roll; it was nice. My wife had cheesesteak with provolone and onions/peppers; hers was really dried out and unappetizing. Overall, not bad but not great.  We might try it again if we are already at the Arboretum shopping center where this place is located, but it definitely won't be a \"destination\" on our dining list."}
{"text":"They have a variety of foods. Always nice to go out for Chili's if you don't know what your in the mood for."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Chili's. I had grilled salmon and shrimp (build your own combo) and it was great! Service was good too."}
{"text":"Had the 10ounce sirloin with cheesy mashed potatoes and loaded fries to replace the steamed broccoli at this location.  Both of our steaks were way under done after asking for medium and medium well respectively, my fries tasted unseasoned, and the mashed potatoes were adequate but not great.  I think I got a decent amount of food for the price but it could have been better.  I like this location and figured they were having an off day.    Our waitress did a great job being attentive and addressing our needs with the steaks.  She gets 5 stars if I were rating her apart from the overall experience.   I figure this is a fluke from an ordinarily good place to get fed at a reasonable price so I'm giving 1 star for past experiences, and 1 star for our waitress (although she'd get 5 if I were rating her apart from my experience."}
{"text":"The food was great especially for a chain restaurant.  I had a burger that was absolutely exploding with flavor.  The boys love the spinach dip and chips.  The service was a bit slow, but definitely friendly."}
{"text":"Let me first be honest, hate the food. But the atmosphere and the bar keep are the reasons I keep coming back. Mike always keeps drinks flowing. And after the remodel, lots of TVs. Food is average, I used to love the California turkey club. But they took it off the menu. But like I said, its all about the atmosphere and the bar keep for me."}
{"text":"A little better then the current rating, but typical of a franchise restaurant. If your just looking for own of their signature dishes like the ribs this location will suffice. If your wanting to try a new menu item I would look for a little higher rated chili's."}
{"text":"I visit Chili's with family and friends about two times per month. We usually go to the the one at Bell and 7th St. or 27th Ave and 101. The food for the most part is at least average to above average. The chips and salsa are a good deal and the green chile and enchilada soups are great. The food is pleasingly the same at each Chili's we visit. However, there seems to be an ongoing kink in the service at the one on North Valley Parkway. When they first opened a while back, we tried them twice because they are close to home. Both times, the orders were messed up and the waitresses were friendly but not very knowledgeable about the menu. The food took forever to arrive and no hint of an apology anywhere. A few months later we decide to try again. maybe they were just new and by now they have the kinks out. Again, the wait time for our food was incredible and getting a drink refill was just wishful thinking.   Fast forward over a year. Last Saturday-Nice waitress, seemingly nice greeters, food was as expected. Over 90 minutes for soup and salad and water to drink. Four times with the same problem is probably not coincidence. The Chilis on 7th St always has the exact opposite. Great service and normal wait time. Hope it changes, it is a decent place to go."}
{"text":"Decent food and good service. Step above many of the other Chilis we have been to   Fajitas were delicious.  The waitress did a good job and was attentive.  Love paying at the table so we can leave when we are ready."}
{"text":"Tonight we had some of the best food at this location that we've had in a couple of years. However, that was after walking out last night and observing what appeared to be some very slow service. There is not alot to choose from in the Tramonto area, and it's nice to have somewhere close, but our last few visits here have not been very impressive. The key problems - slow service, less then genuine service and inconsistent food. At this time, it is unlikely we will re-visit this convenient spot . Hoping things improve! :)"}
{"text":"I tell yeah, I have been extremely impressed over my last few visits to Chili's on S. Rainbow. The Drinks have been great and the food has been amazing as well. My wife and I have been pleasantly surprised actually. Great jobs Guys. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"It is in the airport, wasn't expecting much! The prices are a buck or two more than a regular chili's but for airport food it is nice to be able to sit in a restaurant and get decent food. Better than a lot of the food court stuff."}
{"text":"Being close to dinner time my party of five called ahead for seating. The host said there was no wait and that putting our names down was unnecessary. When we arrived we were told there was a 20 minute wait.. So we decided to wait... 45 minutes later we were told it should only be about 20 more minutes. If I would have known we'd be waiting over an hour we wouldn't have stayed. By this time we were all irritated. Luckily our waiter was very nice I wish I knew her name. However it took a very long time for our food. So long we ordered three appetizers while waiting... So if you could imagine all the waiting we did just to get our food. That's why I'm writing this review."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar  Service was decent, nice bartender. Fried pickles were OK..bit too greasy after the top few. Cajun chicken pasta was good, spicy which I liked but didn't seem hot from the kitchen. Fajitas were average, hot out but had to ask for lettuce. Place seemed loud and no music to drowned the sound. Will I come back...only if last resort. It is convenient to area and highway."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but a great experience here. Our server was polite, checked up on us, and fast!  Service getting seated took a moment, but it wasn't too bad.  As for food, the portions are big, hearty, and wholesome. You will definitely leave satisfied, if not for the rest of the day. But be warned, if you're counting calories you'll need to tread carefully.   If you can, I say stay for dessert! The chcoclate molten lava cake is amazing and such a treat to eat! Defnitely a sharable dessert."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and so was the service! I got the watermelon margarita and spicy shrimp tacos, my boyfriend got a beer and the sirloin burrito, and we shared the cheese bombs and a pizza cookie. Hostess was right there to seat us and waitress quickly followed. Great experience! Will be returning."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I am a frequent Chilis eater. There food is delicious and the restaurant has a great family environment. If it wasnt for the bad service, I would have given this specific location a 5 Star. The hostess was rude, did not smile, and as I walked through the doors holding a baby carrier she just watched. Our server was extremely slow, and the restaurant was not busy enough to make up for her lack of attentiveness. I was disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"The new menu (at least since the last time we ate here) offers a lot of fresh new choices as well as some old favorites.    We primarily went here for our kids, as they loved playing the games on the kiosk.  It used to be that you could simply ask for an extra unit, but we found out that this is going away.  Now kiosks are tied to the table and customers can only get one unit.  In regards to service, the last few visits at the carefree location has been abysmal. Service times have been too long, the waitresses check ins infrequent, and if you happen to be celebrating a birthday, forget about asking for any type of special service.  Overall, the food menu is good, but the location leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Went to Chili's for lunch with friends and our service was awful. Our server didn't introduce himself so we had no idea what his name was. He came over one time to get our drink order and then never came back. After waiting 20 minutes we got up and left."}
{"text":"Excellent service. The people who work there are very nice and throughly answer any questions you may have. However, the food was just mediocre. Nothing too special, unfortunately. I got the original chicken crispers, the batter was somewhat soggy and the fries were just average. Some of the people at my table enjoyed their food so it's either a hit or miss with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Our waiter did not offer refills on any of our drinks .. He also was a little weird. Place was nice though. I got a quesadilla but stopped eating it because I didn't really like the cheese they were using. Hostess was nice as well."}
{"text":"I had not been to Chili's in a while but I remembered their delicious Chicken Enchilada soup and their Fajita's. To my dismay things have really changed.  My soup was tomato based with a few chunks of chicken and tortilla chips. NOTHING ELSE.  I could have gotten something better out of a can.  My beef Fajita's were shredded beef. Not sliced beef brought in on the sizzling grill of my memory. Totally tasteless without seasoning.  Our server who was adequate and courteous to our face apparently was angry about something else had a meltdown a few tables down.  She was cleaning a table that was connected by a wall to our table. She slammed the condiments so hard against the wall our table shook. All the while telling some other server \"her opinion\".  I am sure she thought she was unobserved.  It was unpleasant and uncanny how the discussion at my table at that very moment had been \"how we avoid unpleasant people\". Probably won't be high on my list for another visit for lunch......"}
{"text":"Very clean, nice location at the Blakeney shopping center. We went on Sunday for lunch and ate outside they have shaded outdoor seating for 20-30 people. All four meals were good. (will try to post photos). Kids burger, chicken chef salad, chicken tenders, margarita grilled chicken; all good. Waitstaff was good. Coulda had them check on me less often (including the friendly manager) so we could eat in peace, but better that than to be deserted by the wait staff. Checked out the restroom; clean. Overall this is a really nice Chili's."}
{"text":"2 for 20$ is a fair deal. Food is good, location is nice, service can be slow but the overall experience in pretty nice"}
{"text":"We decided to eat here today since they were one of the few places open on Easter.   My food arrived cold and almost too salty to eat. My boyfriends fajitas were also cold, had inedible parts of bell pepper in it (stem, seeds) along with a hair and he did not receive a plate to eat on.  His mother's salad came with rotten lettuce and veggies and had a burned quesadilla on the side.  Waitress was absent for long periods of time although the restaurant was nearly empty so we had to go look for a manager ourselves.  The manager brought us replacement food that wasn't any better and we were charged full price.  Worst. Why did sonny's have to be closed?"}
{"text":"I totally forgot why I don't come here....yes, the food is amazing and I love their margaritas but the service sucks! It takes forever for a server to even acknowledge you and even longer to take your order and the servers have zero knowledge of the menu items and never have a recommendation! Mental note: don't come here again!"}
{"text":"Came in to eat today 2/28/16 around 3pm. I work in the industry and i have to say the service i recieved was ,to say the least, embarrassing. I was accompanied by my wife and 5 kids. Kids got their kids meals, wife and i ordered steaks. 45 min. After we ordered we still had not received our main coarse. We ate through three baskets of chips and salsa. Drinks were empty for a while and i asked the male manager on duty and he took the glass. Did not come back for about 20 min, With the refill. Only came back cause we had to remind him. Food finally came out and plates were not clean and presentable. My wife ordered a m sirloin that came out well done. Mashed potatoes were dry and crusty on the top. Their food runner seemed lost as he kept asking all the tables if they had ordered what he had in his hands.Called the manager once again for the steak to be fixed. Asked us what we wanted. Obviously my wifes steak fixed. 25 min. Later still no steak at this point my we are very irritated and pay for our dinner and leave. As we leave the steak hits the table. Needless to say, ive eaten an a few chilis, by far the worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Food is great and I love the ribs! Togo orders are seamless. Some of the servers however need some training. Bad attitude and lack of service our past two visits."}
{"text":"After an evening of running errands and also running low on dining options that were open, caution was thrown to the wind and this Chili's location was agreed upon to be our final meal of the day.  The parking lot seemed busy, but happy were we to see that there was not much going on inside.  Quick eats.......or so we thought.  We were seated on the periphery of the bar area.  Our server was nice enough and for that....I won't mention her by the name on my receipt.  All this being said...this particular location played into every single corporate restaurant stereotype I have.  As previously stated, it was not busy, but the speed in which our initial and subsequent orders were taken, one would think it was happening night.  It was not.  My lady ordered soup, salsa and chips meal.  Unlimited if I recall.  If that was the case we would still be waiting for the next order.  Since chips were already ordered, I ordered some queso not wanting to creating waste.  The idea was for it to arrive before our meal to cut the hunger pains, not right right before our meal, and only after I had to ask about it's whereabouts.   In addition to the dip, I ordered a buffalo chicken salad.  When this finally did arrive, it was lifeless.  The kind of lifeless one would find only after it sat under some heating lamp for an unknown amount of time.  Lifeless and shallow was the plate it was served on.  I was left wanting.  To numb the pain of this miserable dining experience, multiple margaritas were ordered.  At one point and time, the last rounds location also had to be inquired about.  Soooooo.....shame on me.  Next time I find myself in the predicament, on this side of town.....we will keep looking for something else, or just go home and eat some eggs."}
{"text":"The service was decent, took awhile for the waiter to take our order.  The food wasn't I expected.  And the waiter seems rushing us but not really checking up on us if we need anything."}
{"text":"Compared to other Chili's, I think it deserves 4 stars.  Then again, I haven't gone to a Chili's in a long time.  I saw a sign as I was walking in that they've made changes to the decor.  Looks nice!!    Chili's food in general compared to other foods?  I gave it 3 stars.  I've never had chili from Chili's so I thought I'd give it a try.  Meh.  We got their 3 appetizer as well and it was yummy.    Overall, I'd say if you like Chili's, I think this one is great.  If you are a Chili's fan, you're not missing out.  Simple as that."}
{"text":"Why did we stop going to Chili's... We were looking for a dinner place on a Tuesday night and ended up here so we can watch a movie next door.   I ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta. It was sooooo cheesy and the garlic bread was perfect crunchy and soft. Yum!! And we got the dessert which is of course the Chocolate Molten! Soooo delishhhhh and ooey gooey.   We used their ziosk to order the dessert which was pretty cool and also paid our tab there. So quick and easy. And our server was great as well!  Def need to start coming here again!"}
{"text":"When you get seated without menus and the waitress says off the bat \" there are 3 tables ahead of you I will be with you as soon as I can\" you best believe I will NOT be spending my money at your restaurant. I'm off to BJ's lets hope they don't disappoint. It Wed 2/10/16 at 8:07p complete fail Chilis! Guest experience is EVERYTHING you should teach that to your employees. Unless your place makes enough profit that it doesn't need my measly dollars!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times before at Mesa Riverview.  Something is just off with this place.  I hate to say every time we have been here something has been wrong over the last four years.  I understand that there are off nights, but it seems to be consistent with this place.  I am not going to critique every little thing about this place.  I think the visit this weekend was probably the last time well go back.  I think this was the 4th time we gave this place a chance."}
{"text":"For a national chain in an airport, they did a pretty decent job!  Whether you're flying in or out, there isn't a whole lot of time to sit down for a long dining experience.  This is why you see so many grab and go places in any terminal.  For someone like me, I always get where I need to be way ahead of time.  I had plenty of time to relax even if service was slow.    This location of Chilis was probably one of the quickest service and food preparation I've experienced. There was no need to worry about time.  Our food tastes just like any other Chilis.  Service was friendly and fast.    I was pleasantly surprised! I certainly appreciated the efficiency!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Love the ziosk for fast check out. Also has game apps you can play for. 99 cents. Great for keeping the kids entertained."}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch. I recommend the 2 for 20 deal it's great food for the price. For a chain restaurant Chilis will always be one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Thee worse Chili's I've ever been to. The hostess up front told us the wait would be 30-35 minutes. The waiting area was full, so we waited right outside. After waiting 45 minutes, I checked to see how long more the wait would be. Her response was, \"I called you like 30 times.\" Why would you not check outside and call out names? So we finally get seated, ordered nachos as our appetizer. It comes 25 minutes later, and our pico de gallo is FROZEN. Like I'm talking ice chips, can't even bite into it FROZEN. Now we're waiting on our entrées. 30+ minutes and counting. The waiter came by once to check on us... This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick lunch before work.  I had the ribs and they were good! Which is more than I can say for the BBQ restaurants I have eaten at here in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i go to this location about once a week.  We always sit in the bar area (much better environment, no huge parties or kids running around), and we LOVE it if we get Gary or Nicole as our waiter/waitress.  We always get great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch last week. Our server introduced herself and stated that another gentleman would be her partner. He walked by our table 6 times and never stopped to see if we needed anything. We pushed out glasses to the edge of the table, in hopes that he would see we needed refills. Six times he passed us with the pitcher of iced tea and never stopped at our table. Our server only came by to drop off the check. We couldn't even get boxes to go. I was fuming mad, so I decided to wait to post this review, so that it wasn't an angry backlash. I have several hundred points with Chilis, and gave a friend the info, so she could use them, as I will never go into that Chilis again."}
{"text":"There are other places around Chili's to eat at. Went there last night and it will be the last time too. The server was not nice to put it. It started out that I forgot my reading glasses (my fault) so I decide to describe to the server what I wanted but she told me that they didn't have that. I asked if they changed there menu lately and she said no. She left so I could figure out what else I might like. My friend found what I was looking for. When she return to take our order she didn't like how I found what I was looking for. That started our service to go downhill. I asked my friend if I went over the line and they didn't think so. My meal was good but the service something else."}
{"text":"Service is fast and friendly. We really liked our server, who checked in with us frequently.  The food was good, and hot. The only thing that could be improved is that the salad had visible wilt."}
{"text":"I noticed this shiny new Chili's on a recent trip to the Aria.  I LOVE a good buffalo chicken salad so I was pretty excited, but with so many great restaurants in the area, I figured I'd save my Chili's fix for the O'Hare airport (my favorite homecoming treat).  One morning/afternoon, after a really fun night out, I found the big red chili pepper, like a beacon in the night, calling me across the street for some 1000 calorie salad goodness.  I wanted to zip over real quick, pick up take out, and come right back to my room.  I have had the Chili's app on my phone for awhile in hopes that one of the O'Hare airport Chili's would let me order from the plane but no luck with that yet.  Fortunately, this Chili's allows you to order from the app.  It worked out great, I even got to customize my order and add avocado!  It's the little things.  I headed out the door about 10 minutes before my order was due to be ready.  After all, this place is right across the street.  Plenty of time.  Upon reaching the end of the Aria drive, though, my fears were realized when I saw that I couldn't cross the street without traveling a couple of blocks in either direction down the Strip.  Obviously, this was crushing news in the blinding daylight and 101 degree heat.  About 20 minutes later  (I may be exaggerating) I finally reached my oasis.  I found the stairway off to the side and headed up to the second floor location.  The interior is really nice.  It's open, spacious, and bright with tons of TVs around the bar.  I guess I never really eat inside of a Chili's so I didn't realize that they have touch screen ordering devices on the table.  You can order when you're ready while watching a game on one of the TVs at the bar...which you can totally see from your table.  It actually seems like a pretty cool place to hang out.  No one was staffing the take out area so I spoke with one of the hostesses.  It seems that there was some kind of mix up with my order so it took a bit of back and forth between the hostess and a guy who seemed like he might be a manager.  When they finally found the order, the register wasn't working so they had to process my payment in the back somewhere.  It was no big deal, though, the staff was all super friendly and apologetic.  The manager even threw in a ridiculous amount of ranch dressing (I have a problem, I know) because I mentioned that I like extra ranch.  When I finally got my salad back to the room, it was beautifully packaged and the presentation was nice.  Unfortunately, it was SUPER salty.  I figure that they're still working out the kinks at this new location.  A little salt isn't enough to keep me away from this place.  I'm glad Chili's made its way to this new location."}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend and our 2 kids on sunday  march 25  around 6 or 7pm.  It was pretty busy but we did not have to wait to be seated.  I love that the restaurant has the Ziosk (mini computer) for the kids to play with.  Our server, Lindsay was awesome.  I really love her upbeat and positive attitude.  She was very nice, efficient, and did a wonderful job.  I had a margarita from the bar and it was the best margarita I've ever had!  I should know, I'm a bartender.  I cant remember what it was called but it was a flavored margarita on the rocks. Our food was good. We had fried pickles as an appetizer, which were delicious. For casual dining, We had a great experience."}
{"text":"I was having a few beers at the bar one evening at chilis on signal butte and baseline , and was served a beer by brittney the bartender  with something like sand in it. It was gritty and I just thought it was a dirty glass,  well I looked on the rim of the glass and I see glass slivers on the inside of the rim. I thought omg I just ingested glass.I asked for the manager.when he showed up i wiped the inside of the glass which still had beer almost to the top and got glass slivers on my finger and showed him.brittney walks by and says its just salt, yeah right.the manager looked at it and I told him to wipe it from my finger and he did and it cut my finger.now I have to worry that my inards are being cut by glass.the reason for this review is to make other people aware to look closely at what is served to them so they dont drink glass too."}
{"text":"First off the greeter has a personality of a door handle. Second we had to wait for a table (booth) and there was hardly anyone in the place. We found out we had to wait because almost every table in the bar and restaurant side still had left over food and trash. It was disgusting. Now this could be due to maybe they were short staffed, but if that's the case that waitress should be cleaning as soon as they leave for the next.  Sorry but it was so unappealing I really didn't want to stay. We did stay and ended up eating in the bar where we had to ask for a booth to be cleaned. The greeter seemed annoyed that we asked this....too bad maybe she should be helping and cleaning these tables. Bye the manager was sitting at the bar just chatting away with another patron. Really!!!! Help out your servers!!! Grab a towel and clean. Our waitress was the bar tender and she was very nice and on it as much as she could. Her name is Kelly. She was very sweet. As we sat down the table was so wobbly we could barely eat from moving we held it down with our feet. My boyfriend tried putting something under the leg to support it but the floor was so soiled and filthy he didn't want to even put his hand near it. Thank goodness we ordered chips because we sat for nearly an hour before we got our food. Btw did I say the place was nearly empty. When we got our food I can say that it was hot and pretty good so there's a plus. We definitely won't be coming back to this location or Chili's at all. There's too many other choices out there to deal with any of this."}
{"text":"I just stopped here for a beer and an appetizer during a layover. The beers were good, they had your general selections for beer, nothing overly fancy. We shared the onion rings. They were your typical chain onion rings. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Too Salty! I could feel my hands tingling from eating too much salt! avoid this place at all costs. They have no sense of how to properly season food. Not going to have a heart attack at this place."}
{"text":"We just returned from having a good time at Chili's.   The service was good. Caleb took the time to introduce himself, more than once, and explain the specials. He even asked if we had any questions about the menu. He is a good bartender and frequently asked if we needed anything.   The food was fresh, well prepared and the plate presentation was great.   I would return to this location."}
{"text":"Well, after waiting five minutes to be recognized, I was told the only seating was at the bar top. Fine. The bartender was very courteous, but unfortunately the remaining staff has a lot to be desired. The seem genuinely inconvenienced by their job. The food is mediocre at best and the place is a mess. Its just dirty.   I remember now why this is the first time in three years that I have been here. I'll check back in three years (probably not).  Not even a good bye as I walk out the door... And the manager was right there."}
{"text":"Well when I ordered I accidentally ordered my cheese fries without cheese. I wish they would have called to verify that. In fact I'm surprised that was even an option to exclude. We got two of the smallest possible chicken strips.. very disappointing. We also never got our toast from the rib/chicken/sausage combo even though the meal comes with toast. Too many things wrong for an order placed when they were not busy."}
{"text":"do not come to this location!!!!       horrible everything!   we came in with a party of 15. everyone pretty much ordered a majority of the menu.  not one meal was up to par. the salmon was dry, steak was horrible & all the vegetables were dry. no one was happy.  we usually have a rule of thumb that we tip 10% for bad service and 35% for good as well as 50% for great service . i have not left a restaurant and not left a tip at all in the last 10 years, but this location takes the cake!  they should be sponsored on bar rescue.  the servers and cooks need to be retrained in how to perform in the service industry. we had to ask for a new server within the first 15 mins of being seated. our second server was just there to take our order and hurry us up. nothing was done without having to flag our server down and ask.       unfortunately for the chilli's brand these employees make customers feel more like a inconveniences then a paying customers, who deserves the attention and customer service they deserve.     save your time and a lot of hassle and avoid this place at all cost!!!!"}
{"text":"Clean, Friendly Servers & a great Lunch deal.  I ordered soup & half sandwich... The food came out rather quickly, which was nice since I only have a n hour lunch.  It was a bit slow, but maybe it was just because Thanksgiving was around the corner."}
{"text":"It's like any other chili's. not the best service; not the worst.  It's a chain so i don't think they really care about training people to be spot-on."}
{"text":"Came here and no one attended us . We waited and no one acknowledged us we were like invisible. Probably racist because they saw us and did nothing"}
{"text":"It's Chili's, what more can I say. However, I am writing a review this time because I got free chips and salsa for checking in on foursquare. Sure the chips and salsa are the cheapest item on the menu, but who can go wrong with FREE. Does Chili's do this at every location? No, it doesn't seem that way.   Well, now that I have passed this tidbit of information to you, make sure you enjoy yourself some chips and salsa.   Bartender was great to me also!"}
{"text":"Just had the best service we have had in a long time.  We ate at the bar and Manuel was our server and he was the best."}
{"text":"I live in Scottsdale, but was in Surprise for a tennis match. My team came to Chili's afterwards to celebrate a win.  We called ahead, and were assured there was room in the bar for us. Unfortunately, when we arrived 15 minutes later, we had to sit at two different tables until another table cleared out and we could finally sit together.  Service was OK.  It was definitely better when we arrived.  Later in the night she got busy, rarely stopped by to check in, and had trouble splitting our checks.  The food was fine.  None of the appetizers were amazing, but none were terrible. The ice cold beer was tasty...but that's tough to mess up.  There are no late-night specials, which seems pretty typical in Surprise.  Comparing it to what I know in Scottsdale, this is not worth checking out."}
{"text":"I like this location,  the staff here are friendly. I can't go out before eating the skillet chocolate chip cookie. Unbelievable !!! Definitely worth the calories."}
{"text":"The manager on duty on 8/29/16 was extremely accommodating and understanding. This is a place of comfort. Thank you for the evening, Chilis!"}
{"text":"The ziosk machine is pretty cool.  You can pay your bill, add a tip, use a gift certificate without waiting for the waiter to come to your table.  Great fraud protection there-keeping you credit card in sight at all times. :)  You can order dessert. Play a multitude of games for a small fee----Great for happy hour but a date/spouse might feel ignored, lol.  The ribeye was ok.  It had a great deal of fat in it.  I normally stick with the sirloin but since I had a gift card, I decided to splurge.  I ended up taking most of it home.  It will make great steak fajitas, lol.    The mac-n-cheese had green chili peppers in it.  Wished they had mentioned THAT-yuck!!!!  Not my fav place to eat but the services was great. :)"}
{"text":"Normally when it comes to lunch in the office, I am able to apply my yelp dominance.  I have street credibility because 99.9% of the time, I am spot on (w/ yelp's assistance) with a joint to eat.  Indecision was the order of the day and without checking the oracle, we sort of randomly ended up at this location.  Chili's is what Chili's does at just about every location I have ever been at.  This location is no exception.  Lunch was busy but our server along with those helping her were on point.  The food was delivered in quick fashion and was all Chili's.  I went with a appetizer sampler, a pick three...if memory serves.  My order consisted of a couple of sliders, some crispy cheese bites, and southwestern egg rolls.    If I am ever in the mood to eat at this corporate giant again, I won't give it a second, I would just go."}
{"text":"Had lunch at noon on Sunday. Seated promptly. They were very busy at that time. We both ordered the pick 3. Only disappointment was no onion rings. Strange since they were only open for 1 hour. Food came on time and hot. Waitress was nice and courteous. For the price will be back."}
{"text":"Nick our server was very kind to us! Great service! Fun funny guy! Engaged my entire family! The girls that brought our food out was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my dining experience at Chili's. After waiting for 15 minutes to be seated (which is fine and expected on a Friday evening) we had asked for a booth and they set us in what we called a half booth. I was fine with that too. After waiting almost 20 minutes we got up and left the restaurant because no one had waited on us or took our drink order. The group of nine seated next to us almost 15 minutes after we were seated were waited on for drinks and was given silverware. I stopped and told the hostess who seated us that we were leaving because no one had waited on us but waited on the group next to us. She smiles and said okay, where were you sitting. I told her I don't know and somewhere over there and I pointed and walked out."}
{"text":"I really don't have very high expectations for generic chain restaurants like Chiles and my experience at this location reinforced my view.   I had Lousy slow service in the bar even on a weeknight when it wasn't the slightest bit busy. The Restaurant area was dirty and there was a group of People smoking cigarettes outside right in front of the door.  The Burgers were decent but they came out warm (not hot), and the fries were soggy (probably was sitting around for a while)."}
{"text":"Food - C Service - F  Slow service, never brought my appetizer but tried to charge me for it. One refill in an hour. Worst service I've had in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered the quesadilla explosion salad, but the cheese on my quesadilla was cold. A friend ordered a sandwich that was supposed to have warm bread, but since the food sat in the kitchen for so long, by the time she got it, it was cold. Very disappointed. Extremely slow service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch this past weekend (03/18/18 @ 11am). We were served by Chris who was very friendly, chatty and knew his stuff! It was nice to have good customer service, which isn't what I typical expect in America.  I shared the 2 Can Dine for $22; the Chips & Guac was a huge portion, big enough for the entire table. Entrees choose were the cajun chicken pasta which was delicious and chicken fajitas which were SO good.   Oh I miss Canadian Chili's"}
{"text":"Took 15 minutes to be acknowledged granted it was lunch time a simple we will be right with you would have been nice.  Food is ok service for food was a little slow for a lunch hour other wise experience here was not bad"}
{"text":"This location of Chilis is pretty decent. It's located on the corner of Eastern and St Rose with plenty of parking.  We usually stop in during lunchtime.  The bar area is open seating with tvs mounted all around for entertainment.  That's where we find a spot.    We have had great service in the bar area.  All of the servers have been really friendly and frequently check on the table.  They have new mini tablets on each table for guests to reorder drinks, order food and even pay the tabs.  So convenient!   We've had several different items on their menu such as queso dip, fish tacos, fajitas and sliders.  Everything has been tasty and piled high.  I always leave full without room for dessert. They do offer several desserts but unfortunately I haven't had the pleasure yet.    It's a chain but I like their menu.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of chains so whenever our eclectic foodie group votes to go to Chili's, I always feel  a wave of excitement comparable to that of receiving  an invitation to a Red Hat Society cuddle party. I end up going anyway placing value in the camaraderie of our group higher than an itch to try something new and different and maybe dangerous. The place is easy to spot because it's right on the corner of the little restaurant row part of the Chandler Mall on Chandler Blvd that includes Firebirds, Keg, Majerle's, Elephant Bar, etc. Funny thing is I'm always asking which driveway to turn into for the other ones but Chili's is the easiest since it's the first. Plenty of parking as it's shared  with other restaurants in the area.     So we've been here so many times we have our own waitress  who knows what we're probably ordering and we always get  the same table in the corner on the way to the restrooms.  Not that we're predictable or anything. I usually get the  bacon ranch quesadillas. But I might get the chicken  club quesadilla instead depending on how long it was since the last time we came by. Their burgers are quite decent as well. The great thing about this place is  there's a big enough menu to satisfy everyone in a big  cranky group. I'll give an extra star just based on that."}
{"text":"Had lunch at the Chili's at Metrocenter this afternoon.  We visit this location about once a month or so for lunch or dinner.  Today was one of my most enjoyable and I largely attribute that to our server Connie.  While the food seemed particularly tasty this time, the attention paid us by Connie from greeting us to the timely refilling of beverages was perfect.  Not too much but she always seemed to be there when we needed something.  We will definitely be back and hope to be seated once again in Connie's section."}
{"text":"I've noticed that they don't serve on the menu the Shiner Bock Burger. (Goes out to all Chilis!) Omg that was so good! Bring back Shiner Bock Burger! So I ordered the Steak Fajitas instead and it was amazing! It just melts in your mouth with the tortilla.  I forgot what the drinks are called but must try! Alcohol trio. Sweet for my taste!"}
{"text":"Came in for the Veterans Day menu and was really impressed with their regular menu prices. Big portions. Not a whole lot of variety, however. I can see it might be awhile until I want that kind of food again.   I loved that they had the tablet things at the table. We played life while we waited - very fun!! Fantastic service too!!"}
{"text":"The Chili's location in Chandler has a awesome crew and great service in the bar area.  Great drinks , good food and good service."}
{"text":"Will have to say , been here a lot for date night and the one night we had a problem,  Mgr \"Wendy\" handled it and fixed everything and they been doing real good ever since.  Thanks to this location tonight for pick up the slack that the location on 75 ave is lacking and in tell they get their game on this well be the place ..."}
{"text":"Will once again the mgrs (Jay) @ the Chili's location on 75th Ave has no clue along with the host on how to help customers !!! We get there and the guy (1st host) tells me about 15min he guess (his exact words), we have problems clearing off table ?  OK we can wait , my party of 5 set down to wait & as I look around,  he was right . I see about 5 tables  (1 large table) just waiting to get cleaned off so I watch how they will handle it ?? Will after 20 min all works and both host walks by them doing nothing,  25 min in to it I asked to talk to Mgr on duty ( Jay ) and the host ( the girl who always does nothing when we go there) calls him and tells me he will be right up ?? 5min go's by and no Mgr & finely the lgr table gets pull apart making 1 table for 4 and 1 for 6 & cleans off the smaller table and then  comes up at witch a party of 3 walks in and they seat them ( remember my 5 & other party of 4 are still waiting ) get a little up set now. Will few min later they clean off the big table they pulled apart and seats us ( still no mgr) we get drinks, appatizer, and dinner. The server at first started off slow but he took care of us and did a great job ($40 tip) about 2 & half hrs go's by (still no mgr but I do see him walking around) i pay bill ( $210 plus tip) and I stop at the host station  (no one to be found ) I ask a  waitress for the mgr (5min go's by) & guess who shows up finally (Jay) I asked why he never came over and gives me a line of crap he didn't know and stands there like he don't care so I leave. Never once did he care .. This kind of management will kill the location business fast ( this location been open now about 6mo ) I eat at all different  Chili's location on average 15 times a month if not more and by far this location management suck !!! So sad and time to wake up and hire a busboy or 2 to fix it OR tell your host to stop standing around joking with each other and clean the table off the second they open up !!! You will be amazed how many more customers you can serve and make more money! !!!!! From a loyal customer to Chili's  (not this location)"}
{"text":"I ordered the steak fajitas for the first time and it was actually really good..Tastey marinade..probably the second best fajitas ive had since ive been to washington dc. then i ended it with a red velvet cake shot..they were only 1.99 mmm"}
{"text":"Went here for a Birthday dinner with my friends. The waiter was nice enough and friendly. But the food was gross.  I will never go here again."}
{"text":"I put my name in at 648 and was told the wait would be 25 minutes, we got sat at 750, no waiter for almost ten minutes and then was told that food would be at least 30-40 minutes and that they are out of chicken, pasta, and tilapia. I understand things happen but someone could have told us prior to us waiting three times longer than our quoted wait time that there was no food. We decided to leave. When I spoke with the manager, she just laughed it off."}
{"text":"Over the years I have not been a huge fan of Chili's. However, since recently returning to my meat-eating behaviors, I've been a bit selective about my choices of proteins. Chili's offers a grass-fed burger patty for $1.00 more, which wins my vote over other places.   As a food safety educator, I am always picky about the cleanliness of a restaurant. Upon entry, I noticed tables that were not bussed, though they did not seem to be understaffed. Usually a big no-no for me. However, the greeter was sure to place us at a table and thoroughly clean it to our liking. Earned their point back.   The food was delivered to the table exactly as ordered. I requested sauces on the side and a slight char to the burger....achieved.  Our server was quite hospitable and attentive.   In comparison to other locations, it was a positive experience. Certainly can not same the same for the Charlotte-Whitehall location. But, that's another review for another day."}
{"text":"This Chilis is deceent. food is cooked they way it was requested. Could have a had a little better service, but it happens. The new chcken strips they serve with the corn and the fries is a GREAT feast. The Kids enjoyed it and after eating my original meal i order one to go.   Not the best place for group gatherings either"}
{"text":"We had great service!   The fajitas are always good and fresh.   Ribs were fine, beans and rice were fine too. Overall good experience.  Our server was what stood out to be the best of the experience & reason this rating went from 3 to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have worked at Chilis before for a few years so I know how the front and back of the house flows. We were sat quickly, greeted quicky, served drinks quickly and efficiently. The order was placed and we didn't wait long for the food. We were never offered chips and salsa.  Did Chilis stop doing this for free or was that laziness on the servers part?   The enchilada soup is as good as I remember, but the pico was missing from the top. The soup needed to be about a few degrees hotter, but I dealt with it knowing it was close to proper temp.  We ordered the fajita trio and it came out sizzling and in a timely manner. What in the heck is this ridiculous tower of sauces and condiments you guys!? So dumb on the restaurant's behalf. This is annoying for both customer and server. 9 ramekins to fill this tower with what seems like a tablespoon at best of each condiment!? Come on! Can we get any cheaper? This is totally tacky.  The fajitas were completely below standard. The beef was chewy, not tender and the chicken was covered in this funky orange sauce. What did you guys do to the perfect fajitas we use to have!? So disappointed.   After eating what we could tolerate, the server presented the check after offering dessert and the kiosk at our table was down. The hostess spent 30 seconds explaining the check out process, all to find we couldn't do ourselves. What happened next? I had to flag a manager down. He runs the check, never asks if everything was ok, never did a table touch.  Boy oh boy, I am not sure I want to claim to be a Chilihead anymore after this experience. Chilis has always prided themselves on holding things to the highest of standards. What is happening at this location?  I even noticed broken lights in the front of the store, I mean this store is on the world famous strip! You guys are serving customers who may have never had Chilis in their life! How can you make a good impression on those people with crazy changes and lack of attentiveness? I hope you guys get it together. It makes me sad to think all has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Was there last night, Christin, server, was awesome. So helpful and friendly.  Had sirloin 10oz steak, cooked good, good flavor. Liked those sweet potato fries and the broccoli."}
{"text":"Went to Chili's yesterday night and was disappointed yet again by this Chili's. Second time we've had slow service and it's taken 25+ minutes to get our food when they aren't busy. I would understand if they were short staffed but there are visable servers hanging out eating snacks and talking loudly. The host is in her own world while guests wait up front to be sat (including us). Honestly fool us once shame on you, but fool us twice shame on us. We plan to take our business elsewhere as it's obviously getting worse."}
{"text":"This location is very friendly and have good customer service.  They have it split in half with a dine in side and a bar side. They have a few beers on tap. With a decent amount of TV's.   This is a great place to meet with friends and hang out or catch a game. They have a pretty good happy hour menu as well.   I recommend the Crispers and make sure you get a STREET CORN, it's a must!"}
{"text":"I've been going to place for a long time and the last few times I went it wasn't very good and the service sucked the game to some coupons to used so we came back but still had the same experience so I probably won't be coming back here"}
{"text":"We have been long time fans of chilis in general. We were thrilled to see a chilis in our new hometown. We came on the Fourth of July and the experience was pretty crummy- long wait for food, and food that didn't taste well. We assumed it was due to holiday. So- here we are again today- same thing. Food slow to come out. Clearly had been sitting under a warmer waiting. Food taste was sub-par. Beef enchiladas tasted awful!!!!!! I wouldn't feed them to our dogs. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. They offer military discount, the manager was thankful for my service, and the his team showed great customer service, and made it a great family place to eat."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I definitely recommend grabbing a bite here. :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this Chili's many times and now that I've decided to never go there again I will leave this review. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because 9 times out of 10 the staff are very friendly and fun. On the other hand, I've never had fast service here. Even on days that were not busy at all. I have to make the annoyed \"please God I'm dying of thirst here\" face at everyone until someone gets my waiter to come by.  I like the chips and salsa. That's the good part. The past 4 times I've tried to go in the past 6 or 7 months, the food is disgusting. I used to love it..But now its Not kind of bad. Not sub par. Disgusting. Most times I'm serves a plate that looks like I took leftovers out of my home refrigerator. Its not good. Half filled southwestern eggrolls. Some weird tasting sauce on the sliders with slimy (not regular grilled) onions. Chewy steaks.....just really nasty every time which wouldn't bother me as much if the bill wasn't so high for the shitty food. Good riddance, chili's."}
{"text":"Would be nice if it was mapped in the right place.  It's on the south side of the 202.... Not north!"}
{"text":"Pay $15 for a plate of greasy Fajitas and they bring you a tablespoon of sour cream for your dish. Want more? That'll be 90cents. That's just rude."}
{"text":"Ordered to go online. Super quick! Then we got to restaurant to pick up order and no one acknowledged our presence. Got the attention of the bartender and stated be with you in a minute. Another person came out and said we needed to go to another area they forgot to put up the sign. Started going and bartender said I'll help you in just a minute. Finally got food after ten minutes wait time when they told me to be there at a certain time. Got home, burgers were burned, cold, very little fries and they were cold too. Went to write survey online and realized I needed the receipt in which they didn't give me. All in all WORST service and online ordering EVER! Food was horrible!! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm actually really sad to have to write this review. I used to love Chilis but unfortunately it has really gone down hill the past few years.   My best friend and I decided to meet at Chilis for dinner and a margarita. I have no complaints about the margarita because it was fabulous. However, the food and cleanliness of the establishment are another story.   I ordered a burger with bacon. It was ok...nothing too exciting about it to be honest. I also got a side of mac n cheese. It was kinda spicy, but otherwise alright. Again I wasn't wowed.   Before we left we decided to stop at the restroom. On our way back we saw into the kitchen. Now that was something I wish I never saw. It was filthy. There was food all over the floor. Food had spilled off plates onto the counter/silver kitchen apparatus. It looked uncleanly and just plain dirty.   We eventually made it to the bathroom and this was also filthy.    I definitely will not be going back to chilies. Ever."}
{"text":"I just went to chili's and had their 3 for 10 deal which is amazing! I not only had a delicious meal for 10 bucks (which included a 6 oz. Sirloin) , but the best customer service I've ever received at a restaurant. The staff and management is amazing. They would all come around and ask how we were doing and made us feel so welcome. I just wanted to let you guys know that I will definitely come back to this location. You guys deserve the recognition!"}
{"text":"Chili Queso dip is always a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"Okay, seriously, I LOVE their Salmon.  I never, ever would have thought that a chain restaurant could produce something that good, but it is definitely worth the try.  I hate to say it, but Chili's is becoming one of my favorites.  Besides, the husband likes it, so why not?!"}
{"text":"I really do enjoy the atmosphere in Chili's and the food (for the price) is the best. It's like I have to get my regular dose of the South Western Egg Rolls!  They added these really cool Kiosks to the tables (at least in the bar section - I wasn't looking elsewhere) that you can play games on, order drinks, appetizers, and pay your check! Sure makes it easier to reduce delay in paperwork when your in a hurry!   Always a favorite!"}
{"text":"After writing my review last November, I did receive a gift certificate and apology from someone with Chili's.  However, I never took them up on the offer to make it up to me.  I appreciated the customer service effort, but I have no desire to go back."}
{"text":"i eat here at least every two weeks. The big bites and the steak oh my i love it. the chocolate chip cookie is the BEST, the bartender she is awesome."}
{"text":"Alex the server/to go person was AWESOME!  Very nice and took our order with ease. Food was great especially the Southwestern egg rolls!  :-)"}
{"text":"Bad experience here. Not a fan of the food what so ever. The Margartias were full of salt at the bottom of the glass. Onion rings were over done. I ordered the small sirloin plate meal. The potatoes were gross, the meat was disgusting and over seasoned and hard, and even the broccoli was rubbery. Just disappointed, I barely ate three bites because it all just tasted horrible. Service was average. I am willing to pay for a good meal but this wasn't even decent."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today...just the lunch special soup and salad...  The new Spicy Southwest Chicken & Sausage Soup was delicious! It had huge pieces of chicken and sausage with a creamy base and just the right amount of kick...I loved the spicy after taste each bite left the tortilla strips on top were a nice crunchy kick to top it off!  And just a regular house salad, lettuce, cheese tomatoes,cucumbers, onions and cruotons...it came in a small bowl and for the lunch portion I considered it a lot of food.  The only reason I didn't give more stars is because it took forever to get our lunch...we only had an hour for lunch and 40 minutes later we were still without our food...  But for a quick bite, its a good deal....depending on what you get its either $6, $7, or $8...and that's not too bad!"}
{"text":"It's been forever since I've been to Chili's but my family was visiting and we were starving and we didn't feel like a looooong wait on a Friday night. So we just decided; what the heck...let's just go to Chilli's!  We arrived a little after 8:00pm and there was no wait...whoooo   Our waiter was pleasant, a little forgetful at times but still attentive and nice.   Here goes:  For starters chips and salsa- Classic! The first basket of chips seemed like the end of the bag...all small pieces and crumbs...no bueno... but the next set of chips that we asked for was much better. The salsa was good....I was a bit bummed though, they used to offer a mexi ranch salsa which apparently they don't anymore...but no matter I still like to mix the salsa with a side of ranch dressing. YUM.  For dinner my parents did the Ante Up 2 for $35 with the margaritas, these had absolutely no alcohol. Just a warning, if you like margarita mix and ice then I guess they are pretty good for you. To eat, they both chose ribs and fries for their meal. The ribs were good, they came out warm, but the sauce was delicious. The fries actually came out piping hot....total WIN Overall, it was good...certainly not outstanding but still good.  I chose the fajita trio which comes with steak, chicken and shrimp onions and peppers. With a side of tortillas, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, pico and guacamole. Again it was good, but didn't have a \"wow\" factor. I wish there had a been a bit more seasoning on the chicken and shrimp AND that it had come out sizzing...I mean they are fajita for goodness sake!   For dessert we all shared the chocolate molten cake. Delish! No need to explain...we devoured it. It's just something about ice cream and chocolate cake that just makes me very happy.   Overall, if I'm in a crunch again, I'd eat here but it's not on the top of my list."}
{"text":"I have to give this place major props for the great service we get EVERY time we go.  We have an 18 month old who behave fairly well in restaurants.  What I love most about their service is that they really know how to cater to families.  Any time we bring our daughter, they make sure her food comes first (because what little kid can wait very long to eat).  They also make sure she always has what she needs.  As a parent, I can't tell you how much I appreciate when places cater to families and helping them out!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and got terrible service. Got chips and guacamole and most of the chips were small broken pieces. The bartender never even asked if I wanted a second beer. We have been done eating and have piled up our dishes and have 2 empty beer glasses and am still waiting for our check. Did I mention we are at the bar?"}
{"text":"Well food was great service is what was disappointing. The waitress came and asked for my drink and took my menu before even asking if i was ready or not. Then when I ordered I asked for Carnita tacos and she came back with fish tacos -_-"}
{"text":"I know that my expectations of Chilis should be  low.  This location has been pretty bad.  My kids love Chilis so their Grandma will order it at least twice a month for pick up.  If a restaurant has a pick up window they really should have to go food down.  No excuses.  Last visit I ordered fajitas and the vegetables were literally raw.  Crunchy, inedible raw.  I actually had to cook the peppers and onions before I could eat them.  I'm glad I did because while cooking them I noticed that there were tons of onion skins in the mix.  Gross.  Someone was being real lazy in the kitchen.  Because my kids love the place we tried again (sigh).  The place was a madhouse with people waiting 30-45 past their pick up times.  Half our food was sitting in a bag and half was not ready.  By the time we got all the food of course half the order was cold and the burgers we waited on were not pink inside, they were raw.  Mushy, undercooked raw barely browned on the outside.  We had to again cook these before we ate them and reheat half the other food.  We get takeout to avoid cooking for a night so this defeats the purpose of our relaxing evening.  Your kitchen has some serious problems Chilis.  Might be time to rethink some things and get some help.  I think this is our last try, the kids will need to find a new fave place."}
{"text":"Just right now we arrived and had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. There were a few people at the bar and some patrons but it was not busy at all. A few servers saw us but did not acknowledge us. Finally the host appeared, he sat us and left. About 6 more minutes passed. Not a waiter in sight. A few waiters walked by. No acknowledgement. Lost my business.   I am more than patient and sensitive to business that are short staffed when there is some form of customer service but here I found none."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here all thanks to our waiter Nick. He was very tentative to our needs but went the extra mile for the kids. I am always happy when the kids get their food first but it was more than that. Nick got extra canyons for them when my youngest broke his and was quick to make sure we didn't even have to ask for anything because he already offered. He was very professional but friendly and easy to talk to. We've gone to Chilies many times before but Nick made it that much better. Thanks Nick!"}
{"text":"I used to love their honey BBQ ribs, until they decided to do away with it and replace it with the inferior \"Shiner Bock\" BBQ sauce, which doesn't even begin to compare.  So these days I just take it with the original sauce, grin and bear it, even though I still lament the ol' honey BBQ days.  Oh well.  The ribs themselves are good...kind of sparse, so do yourself a favor and order the full rack...the half rack just doesn't cut it.  Oh, and their Molten Chocolate Cake is DIVINE.  Definitely worth all the calories, guilt and heartache you'll suffer later."}
{"text":"LOVE Chili's!  The wait staff --everyone there is fantastic!  Talk about superb customer service-WOW, they ROCK!  The food is delicious!  Ample servings, served hot and so very flavorful!  My hat is off to the chef there to a job well done!  The best part, it's affordable.  What a great place to go for lunch, with friends or your family.  Very kid friendly, which is important to us!  Fabulous restaurant!!"}
{"text":"What happen to Chilis. I used to eat at Chilis all the time. Great food and the Margaritas where always great. It's been about 5 years and I recently went. The Margaritas and service where great. The food was nothing like it used to be. I had the southwest egg rolls and the fajitas. The egg rolls tasted like something they bought in the frozen section of walmart. The fajitas came out with barley any veggies and only three tortillas. I was not happy and they have lost me as a customer"}
{"text":"Well!  I come to this location often.  Its close. We normally sit in the bar area.  But i do hesitate and cringe when i see a particular bartender.  Its \"usually\" quick but i have to say this!  Everytime i come and i see Hyo behind the bar i want to turn around and run!  Horrible service.  Slow service. No personality.  As a guest i should never have to wait to be greeted, wait forever for my food or wait to leave.  Whenever Hyo (the bartender) is there we wait on all three.  This isnt a rant on Chili's.  This is a rant on their choice of bartenders and Hyo is horrible.  If you see him when you walk in DO NOT sit in the bar area. I repeat DO NOT sit in the bar area when Hyo is working!"}
{"text":"i have never had such bad service in my life and i have never been so mad about bad service before either. My friend and I decide to go to Chili's for our 1hr lunch break. We arrive at 11am. Within 5 mins of being there we order our food. She orders hers, i order mine, and we order one to go for someone else back at work. We sit there for 45mins without receiving our food before having to track down the waitress (because no one bothered to check on us). We tell the waitress to just bring out food out to-go because now we have run out of time and need to get back to work. 5 mins later we get our food and 2 out of 3 orders are wrong! One was a completely different meal than what was ordered. i ask how long it would take to re-make them and we are told about 17mins. At this point we have 10mins to get back to work. Needless to say, we ended up leaving and going back to work without getting to eat any lunch."}
{"text":"Had the ribs, they were a 4 on a scale of 1-10. Decided to give them another try, had the sirloin, again a 4. Going elsewhere next time.  They said they had a great craft beer menu, they do not!  Service was good."}
{"text":"I eat at this Chili's fairly often...  maybe 10 times per year.. and finally decided to review it. The food is usually pretty good. Every now and then it's just OK. Service has always been good in the restaurant. Service in the bar is mediocre.  Chili's in general is better tasting than most other chains I find... and is a good value.  The chipotle flatbread is one of my favorites. Margarita chicken is usually pretty good... the chicken is cooked perfectly 9 out of 10 times (and you know most places can't cook a chicken breast to save their life). The pepperoni pizza is not that great (lots of bread little of everything else). Burgers are usually pretty good. I tried the mexican combo plate once... was not super impressed. The mexican bowl was good though."}
{"text":"I have only eaten at this Chili's a couple of times. As I recall, it's always been pretty good, but I had one of the best hamburgers here the weekend before last (12/28/2014) so I felt compelled to review it. I had one of their new craft burgers.. the guacamole burger. I added bacon. My wife had the same thing. We were both very surprised at how good the burger was. It was cooked perfectly to order(medium rare) and had lots of cheese, grilled peppers and guacamole. It was deliciously messy. I chose to write this review because I went to another Chili's (on Stapley Dr.) this last weekend and ordered the same thing. Unfortunately, the burger I had there didn't even compare to the one I had here."}
{"text":"I went to this Chili's last weekend and ordered the guacamole craft burger and added bacon. I had had one of these the week-end before at another Chili's (Chandler Blvd) and it was one of the best burgers I've had (top 10 for sure).  The burger I had at this Chili's and it was pretty terrible in comparison. I mean, it was edible, but so is McDonald's. You could totally tell they were trying to cheap out on the quac, peppers and cheese. It was also a little over cooked (more medium/medium-well than medium-rare). Overall, it was a huge disappointment. I don't know if it is this Chili's in general or just the cook on duty, but I think I'll go to another location next time."}
{"text":"I've always loved chili's for the laid back atmosphere. Happy hour is only at the bar so I'll have to remember that next time. The food is awesome. I usually get the Chipotle chicken Flatbread but today I got the honey-chipotle chicken crispers and they were amazing."}
{"text":"Chilis is chilis, it's fast food but In a restaurant.  We ordered chips salsa corn dog meal for child and crispers.  Every thing was greasy and it looked like the oil was desperate for a change.  Although the food was terrible. The manager \"Roland\" took care of us and event went back to the kitchen to check on the oil and batter.  I would have given 1 star except Roland saved the day by truly executing a leadership role.  Thank you Roland."}
{"text":"Gotta say I like to eat! Had the  Fajitas oh so good. Friendly employees and food is good. Love the fried pickles.."}
{"text":"Was told it would be a 20 minute wait, took 45 minutes to be seated. Then after ten minutes of waiting for a server we decided to leave. I'm usually an extremely patient person so getting me mad is quite exceptional."}
{"text":"Definitely would not recommend this chili's. We started off with chips and queso. The chips were adequate but the queso was horrendous. It was very unappealing and tasted horrible + the plate was chipped. Service was was alright. The service provided was ok. We sat by the open kitchen, big Mistake in which we heard workers making loud noise in the back. My entree was the boneless chicken wings. Might as well have gone to McDonalds, get bbq sauce and save my $12. Overall my experience was unpleasant and am not returning."}
{"text":"Starting this review with a statement of the obvious.  It's a chain and some things are to be expected across the board at all Chili's.  This location is a bit dated and could use a good scrubbing in the corners (especially the hallway leading past the kitchen to the restrooms)  After waiting our promised 15 minutes, we were seated in the bar area, even though there was a table in the restaurant we could see from the waiting area.  Whatever - it was just a casual lunch, using a gift card and we were hungry.  Our waitress was nice enough and took our drink order quickly and returned shortly to take our food order.  I ordered the Classic Bacon Burger minus tomato.  I took the chance on the special sauce (think Big Mac sauce) and won't do that again - it was runny, messy and the bits of what I think were relish (maybe onions) were chewy and it was just not good.  The plate came with the Chili's garlic pickles which were also on my burger (I must have misread the description as I would have left those off too) these are serve with huge pieces of garlic in it, like slices of whole cloves.  Yeah, no.  That's not going to work for me either.   Fries were the standard side, which was fine, but mine were lukewarm if even that.  Bummer.  The waitress came back once to check on us, not giving us a chance to say I needed more water, even though I had an empty glass while she was there - I ended up swiping some of my husband's to wash the rest of my meal down so we could get on to the rest of our afternoon.  I can't really fault them for standard bar food - this is what they serve - but overall look and feel of the place was just, as my two stars rate, meh.  We were instructed to use the table top checkout kiosk which had a problem with our card and then had to wait for the waitress to finally make it back to us to run the card the old fashioned way - oh the horror!  Anywhoo, we will one day go back I'm sure due to a gift card or group selection, but this location will surely be at the bottom of my list to revisit in Gastonia."}
{"text":"Meh, it was fine.   I was meeting up with a friend to do some shopping and she suggested we grab a bite here. It wasn't my first choice with all the other good options around but she loves this place so I figured - why not.   The place was busy, but not overwhelming. It took a minute to get a seat and then for our waitress to come over, but once she greeted us she was pretty pleasant.   I ordered the mango chile chicken from the lighter options it's a chicken breast topped with spices, mango and avocado. On the side rice and broccoli. I loved the hidden spice in this dish. The mix of sweet and spicy were a treat to my tastebuds! But the sides were awful! The rice was cold, hard and crunchy and the broccoli was wayyyy over cooked. Yuck, no thank you.   Like I said, this wouldn't be my first choice for food in the area. But overall, everything was just okay."}
{"text":"Awful service. Waiting for 10 minutes after I was seated and then had to get a server myself. Then was just asked if I was ready to order no drinks no silverware or anything. Also the host sat us at a dirty table. Just took a cup off and sat us down didn't wipe it off or anything. The food was good and warm still but the service was absolutely awful. Also after contacting the manager that we were sitting for 10 minutes and hadn't had any service he asked a server to come over and said \"I already have a table\" awful management. Awful service. I would have rather went to McDonald's"}
{"text":"I thought I would give it another try after many years because they started offering table side guacamole.  Table side guacamole was good, but the chips were terrible.  The chips were loaded with table salt and very thin.  Chip broke with every dip.  Things sounded good on the menu, but tasted blah and boring.  I know it is a chain, but the food could have been better.  Cinnamon lava dessert was good.  Service was okay, but a little slow.  Probably will not be going back anytime soon.  Nothing memorable nor special."}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain ...BUT...it's two for two on terrible experiences. The first time the server was MIA and I had to go find someone else to ask for to go boxes. She came around and said she'd bring them over.. Never saw her again and ended up having to go to the manager in kitchen to request the boxes. Still tipped because I figured maybe she's having a bad night. Okay, fine. Maybe it was a bad night despite the whole place being empty. Tonight,  I decided to give it another shot. Asked to sit outside in the smoking section. The hostess explained the smoking area isn't served, okay, we can sit in the patio section then. No biggie. After waiting a good 15 minutes no one came to even ask if we wanted water. Odd, the smoking section is being served from what we can see. We ended up leaving and handing the hostess back the menu's who seemed unbothered by it anyway. Her response was a snippy have a goodnight. Won't make this mistake again!"}
{"text":"The only good service you get from this chili's is from the bar area. Every time we go in they mess up on our order. Don't order steak because it is never cooked right. Order an appetizer and it comes after you received your food. Im done with this location, they say its because they are so busy but really they are not. Will not be going back even if they said it was free."}
{"text":"Seems kind of silly to review chili's but I was impressed! They are offering $20 for an appetizer and two FULL SIZE ENTREES.  We got the fried pickles, bacon quesadillas and crispers! We couldn't even finish everything! Food was fresh and tasted delish! This particular location is newly updated and we sat in the bar area the servers were attentive and friendly! Worth checking out if you want a good deal!"}
{"text":"Ask for Deanne, she's usually running the bar. She special orders our 25 minute wings and they come out just right. Thanks to her and Kim too she does a great job!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is hands down the best. If I could give more stars just on that alone I would. What's not to like, it's your friendly neighborhood chili's!"}
{"text":"Food is average but not special but on every occasion we have been to this particular location the service has been terrible. It's slow and the waiters either don't check on their tables or don't know how to articulate and communicate in general. I recommend training but we prefer the extra drive to the chili's in Peoria. Same food and better service"}
{"text":"This is the worst Chili's. The clientele sucks. The waitstaff sucks. Our waitress' fingernails were so long and yellowed and dirty. Our drinks stayed empty. Our food was cold. Our guacamole tasted of nothing.  I could go on, but I won't. Just don't come here.  UPDATE: SORRY COULDNT NOT SAY ANYTHING... My steak was over cooked, my broccoli raw and ice cold. My fried egg on my steak looked like a 3 year old had cooked it on A DIRTY PAN. Fajitas WAY over spiced, chicken pasta WAY BLAND.  WORST OF ALL, OUR NASTY WAITRESS HAD HER LONG NASTY YELLOW THUMBNAIL DOWN IN MY SONS PASTA WHEN SHE WALKED UP. She pulled her thumb out and there was Alfredo sauce all over her thumb and nail. DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"Hey just a shout out to all you fellow Yelpers. This location/franchise is rotten from the top down. The pervasive apathy of the staff, including the manager is pathetic. I had not been to a Chili's in quite some time and after my experience today, I am sure my next visit will sometime around the 1st of Neveruary! I wish I could make this blog short but no I'm sorry this deserves some detail!  So I stopped by today around 4:30 for some happy because traffic was backed up on the 101. The bar was nearly empty and a server was sitting at the bar sharing a \"bitch session\" with the bartender. I ordered only two items- a Fat Tire draft beer and an order of wings with what I think to be a simple and common request- that the wings be cooked well done and extra crispy. What I was served about ten minutes later was this hot mess pile of tiny, under cooked, over sauced, soggy, biggest insult to Buffalo wings I have ever encountered. I ate one bite of one wing and it could not have been more perfectly, 100% opposite of what I had ordered and been expecting. So I pushed them aside, finished my beer and attempted to use the little kiosk terminal on the bar to tab out, but of course it was not even close to correct so I asked the bartender for my check. She was observant enough to see I didn't eat the wings and asked what was wrong. When I told her they were not extra crispy and a soggy, hot mess she insisted they cooked them \"twice as long\" (so I assume 4 minutes in the microwave instead of 2). But no worries my phenomenal bartender says she will take them off the tab and then hand me a check for two Fat Tire drafts instead of one. When I called her out on that, she got upset and insisted I had two so I said okay, fine how about you call the manager over here for me and she said sure and left the bar.   A few minutes later, a fifty something blond lady shows up, does not even bother to introduce herself and simply says I'm the manager and asks what was wrong. I proceeded to tell her the above experience and her reply was simply \" oh well everybody makes mistakes, what are you asking me for here?\" I mean really? So that's what they taught you to say at Chili's University! Her apathetic, I could care less attitude is all I needed to know to understand just what is going on at this location. Her base, unprofessional attitude made it obvious she has no standards and therefore neither does the staff! So wow, if you have to go to a Chili's and I have no idea why you would, please for the love of God don't go to this location!"}
{"text":"Meh... only a few steps above Mickey D's. I do however like their Presidente margarita."}
{"text":"I like this chilis because most of the time the food is fresh the only problem is the service could be better"}
{"text":"Service was really bad. At the time we came in it wasn't busy. The bartender was very slow. We waited 10 minutes for refill of tea even though they were not busy. Will not be back."}
{"text":"We love the staff and managers here.  For a bit the food was not great... but it is back to really yummy!!"}
{"text":"Service was wonderful, but when my food came out room temperature I was shocked. That never happened before and it was the tilapia."}
{"text":"I hate to do this but the place is soooo bad . unfortunately places like this attract so many  cheep trashy people the staff now has no moral."}
{"text":"Dirty floors!  Cleanser and filthy towel in full view of customers as they come in!  Spray cleanser sprayed the salt and pepper containers!  Dirty towel being used over and over to clean the dirty tables!  Yuk, yuk, yuk!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say this place has really gone downhill.  Forgotten items that take more than one reminder to bring on several orders, steaks cooked too rare and continue to be rare upon further cooking, shouting \"Does anyone need anything?\" down the length of a long table and asking customers to pass down dirty plates as it was easier than going down the table and stopping every couple of people to collect.  We were a large (had reservations) party that were made so uncomfortable by management shutting down the air conditioner when it was still 80 degrees (I checked), that the warm blown air from the fans caused us to leave.  The check was given without any offers or questions about dessert or coffee.  Servers were scrambling over tables doing cleanup while we were still gathering our things.This was a little after 9pm and the place was supposed to be open until 11pm.  We felt hurried and disrespected. I had bragged that this was my favorite family restaurant.  These were out of state family members and we were having a reunion.  I was humiliated because I made the choice.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Good service. love their mudslide. Friendly bartender. We ordered the chips and salsa and queso. Chips and salsa were excellent. The cheese dip was a little salty."}
{"text":"\"MEthinks not?\"  NO!! I KNOW NOT!!  This Chili's will not get another dollar from my pocket.    I have given them 3 and 4 chances and it NEVER gets better.  Every meal has come to me cold.  The drinks.....BAD. Even desert sucked.  I am a very fair person and I have given them the last chance.    The service is even lacking......the servers spend more time playing with each other rather than doing their jobs.  It is more than frustrating to hear that your food is up and they are giggling about the GREAT time they had the night before in the club's bathroom with some random guy.    While I enjoy a great \"club bathroom sex story\" like the next girl....I would prefer that I had hot GOOD food while I am hearing about it and trying to explain to my 10 year old that it IS NOT OK to do that!!  LMFAO!!  Again.....don't waste your money, time, or taste buds on this particular Chili's.BUT!!!  If you are looking for a good time story and cold ass shrimp this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"So sad to be writing this because, we do like going to Chili's... just not at this location. My husband and I decided to stop by at this Chili's yesterday for lunch. The hostess was very nice and sat us down right away. Waited for a few minutes for our waitress. She took our drink orders, water for me and a Dos XX for my hubby with a lime. We also ordered the nachos, jalapenos and pico de gallo on the side. She didn't write it down and my husband said, our order was going to be wrong (I hate when he's right). She finally came back with our drinks, maybe 5 small ice cubes in each water glass (no joke) and a nice warm beer with no lime to go with it. My husband was going to ask for a new beer, but she never stopped by until the nachos arrived. Hubby was right, jalapenos were on the nachos and she said she told them jalapenos on the side. Now, she could have done 2 things, she could have told us what happened  before bringing them out and ask us if we still wanted them or she could have said, \"I saw that there were jalapenos on them so, I asked them to make a new one.\"  Did not do either one. Food arrived, she didn't ask if we wanted more drinks, we had to ask for them.  The restaurant was also disgustingly dirty. Tables that weren't cleaned from prior guests, floors filled with food and crap. It wasn't even that busy. The sad part was, the nice hostess was the one cleaning the tables, sweeping the floor, re-arranging the tables, AND seating people. All this time, she still had a smile on her face. We decided to tip the hostess since she was actually pleasant and was going above and beyond to keep the restaurant presentable. At some point, I'm sure we saw the manager attempting to clean a table, but we noticed he left it for someone else to clean up. Will never go back to this location. The hostess should get a raise for all the work she was doing."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad, but the best services comes in the bar section of the restaurant. Our server/bartender Danielle was great! She was busy with other tables, but served us with a smile and always checked on us. She was great and will definitely be back! Make sure you sit at the bar and say hi to Danielle!"}
{"text":"We needed to get a take out dinner for my daughter, who was recovering from surgery, and her family. Chili's is close to their home and I have had good experiences eating at other Chili's in the past. I went on line through Yelp and was able to view their menu and place my family's orders. Their on line take out menu was a pleasure to use - very intuitive. Needless to say, I made an error in getting my daughter's order. But the fix was also ridiculously easy. They promised that it would be ready at 4:59 PM. We got there just at 5 o'clock. Sure enough, the order was ready for us and still warm. And they got everything exactly correct. We ordered the Two for $20 special. Saved us $4 on the list prices for the entrees and they threw in a free app. Such a deal!!! We got the chicken fajitas and an extra of rice and beans for an additional buck. Definitely worthwhile if you are getting the fajitas. We also got guac and chips as our free appetizer. It went really well with the fajitas. The portion size for the fajitas was huge - more than enough for the two of us to share. The chicken was super moist and tender. The fajita veggies were mostly fried onions and green peppers. But it also came with a nice supply of sour cream, cheese, salsa, pico de gallo and jalapeños on the side. The flour tortillas were just OK. My son-in-law loved his chicken and pasta dish and my daughter really liked her hamburger. Overall, a very good take-out meal for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Sad to be writing a poor review. I often order the chips, salsa, and guacamole to go. I have NEVER had two orders that were the same. Some days the chips are filled to the top of the bag, but last time I didn't even get half a bag of chips and it was full of crumbs. Some days you get a full cup of guacamole and a smaller cup of salsa, sometimes you get a full cup of both, but today I got a half a cup of both!! I understand getting a smaller cup of the salsa as the item I ordered was \"guacamole\" and the salsa comes as an additional dipping sauce, but why do I get half of the normal size of guac when I pay the full amount? Also have ordered it before where it seemed to not even have tomatoes and onions in it and other times where it's loaded with each. A bit confused.... needs some consistency."}
{"text":"Called ahead for group of 18. Told by gentleman to come on down. The manager came over and told us she couldn't seat us. Very unfriendly and rude. If it weren't for the location this place would be closed. Bad attitude!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! Chilis what's really going on? First off we had a great waiter. Very friendly and attentive throughout the hustle and bustle. However, we sat and waited an hour for our food and my granddaughter still had to wait an additional 10 minutes for her food. I asked to speak to a manager who tried to justify for the delay. And to top it off a few tables that sat after us got their food first. Been to this location many times and never experienced such a disappointment like this. Will think twice about returning."}
{"text":"I eat at this location all the time, like seriously, all the time, and tonight was awful.  I've had crappy service here and there, cold food, and random things, but I don't know what has happened the last few times I've been here. My food was stuck to the paper, my rice was hard from the heat lamp and my beans were cold. I asked, I believe the hostess for a plate, and instead of a plate, she sent the manager. I do not send food back and just needed a plate that nobody seemed to want to bring me. My brothers food had to be remade, my friends food had to have parts remade and my SIL had cold food, except for her piece of meat. The only good dish was my husband's and all he had was a chicken bowl thing. You are one of the few places safe for me to eat, I am so annoyed right now.  My meal was comped, but that isn't what I wanted or asked for...I wanted an enjoyable meal and not be forgotten at our table. On a nicer note, I have also had wonderful food here and will give you another chance."}
{"text":"Worst dinner experience in a long time. Took 10 min to be seated and then waited for 15 min to order. No teamwork with the waiters. Food ok, wife's order was wrong. Will not return."}
{"text":"The service was fine.  However the food was pretty disgusting.  I ordered some tacos that tasted like it was out of a tacobell drive thru at 2 am.  The meat on them was over seasoned and had a lot of gristle.  The worst part is that they put a garlic butter sauce on the tacos.  I normally enjoy garlic, but why put it on tacos!!??  I used to really like the chilis chain but I feel like there food quality has plummeted."}
{"text":"Food was good, the service was questionable, not sure where the waiter keeps going to seams he's hiding in the back area I guess. All the servers looked absolutely miserable,we watched them for the length of are dinner about 45 minutes not one how are you or a smile.  The manager should be ashamed for the poor service and attitude of the servers.   Maybe corporate should look it some management/server training."}
{"text":"Ok.. I ate at the Chiili's in  Santa Barbara back in 2003 I believe and thought it was great...  Always wanted to go back to any Chilli's but never did, because I moved to Maui and they didn't have one on the Island.. March of 2017 we moved to Vegas and not far from the Chilli's on W  Charlston .. Went there yesterday for the first time and I was pretty disappointed... Nothing like I remembered. I say some pretty good looking  burritos on the menu, but when I went to order one, I was told they didn't have burritos anymore. I also heard the kid sitting in the next booth order a corn dog from the menu and he also was told they didn't have them anymore.....   So. I found something they did still serve witch was the  cajun chicken pasta and it wasn't all that good. Pretty dry with a TV Dinner taste..  The prices weren't bad, but I won't go back into a Chilli's again.. The good thing is, the waiting and wanting to go into a Chilli's again after 14 years is OVER"}
{"text":"Went in today at 1:30pm. The place was empty. We both ordered soup and salad, figuring we would have a quick lunch.   Waited 20 minutes for the soup to show. It was cold, so sent it back. Another 20 minutes, and these soups were hot, but not very good. We both ordered different soups, and another 20 minutes. Again not good, but we just wanted to get out of there.   They have terminals on the tables that should have allowed us to pay and go. Of course it was not working.   Waited and waited for the waitress to show up and let us pay. No sign of her. Finally gave another employee some money and waited and waited for change. After waiting forever, finally got our change.   With such terrible slow service, what is it like during regular meal times. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"You would think a 'restaurant' whose moniker    derives from the Nahuatl would better supply ample heat to their dishes. Alas, spice is the only thing conservative at this Chili's."}
{"text":"This was a nice experience.   Stopped off for lunch as I was working. The atmosphere was great, service was excellent!  I sat in the bar area. The Diet Coke was non stop! As my cup was almost empty, the next one was there. Nichole was an excellent server.  Getting in and out was a bit difficult as its located on a very busy intersection.  The food was good. I felt it was a bit pricey, but that's a corporate thing!  Bathrooms and restaurant were clean. I noticed staff cleaning the entire time I was there.  I would go there again, would love to do the 2 for $20.00."}
{"text":"I ordered food online for curbside pickup and arrived at the time I was provided. I did not read anywhere that I needed to call them and inform them I was there. The manager brought my food and told me I was supposed to download the app and let them know I was here. Then I checked my bag of food only to find stuff missing and I had to go inside which defeated the whole purpose of curbside. The manager asked me what I needed and I told her my missing soup. There was no urgency and then she had the nerve to ask me if I wanted something for my trouble she could go back and get it. You shouldn't have to ask the customer you should just hand it to them there on the spot. I wasn't going to wait around for a free appetizer because I was already rushed on my lunch break."}
{"text":"Moved away from North Olmsted and I am missing my favorite go to restaurant.  The wait staff was always good.  The food was always served promptly and was always good.  Miss this one the most of all since moving away!"}
{"text":"Couldn't play a YouTube video today without watching the stupid ad... I have never been so sick than when I ate at chilis... their food is always blah... go somewhere else you can't do worse... that is for sure..."}
{"text":"My family and I were seated immediately, but that was the only timely thing that happened. After seating us and being greeted by the waiter, fifteen minutes went by before we saw him again to order our drinks. The entire night the service was terrible; the waiter only stopping by to drop off our drinks and food. Our dinner took an additional thirty minutes after the drinks came. We got our appetizer after dinner (still paid for it though). One of my friends was seated near us, after we arrived, but got their food and finished it before we even got ours.  With no apologies or explanations, I'm left thinking this is the norm and have no desire to go back to find out."}
{"text":"This Chilis was great start to finish. The waiters, hostess, manager, bartender, and everyone else was working so hard to make sure all the tables were taken care of, and although they seemed a little understaffed the ones who work there are awesome. We were served by Jake, the bartender, who was so nice and helpful, recommended great drinks, got our orders perfect (by memory!), brought everything out in good time, and was overall a great worker. The food runner was very nice as well, I didn't get his name, but he is blonde with glasses. Food was awesome, the kitchen was speedy and all of it was hot off the pan. Thanks for a great experience Jake, and the rest of the staff and we will definitely be back if you have him on your staff!"}
{"text":"Great dinner lots of choices... I love their chips and salsa we always get a big side of ranch to dip the chips into (if you haven't tried it, do... very awesome)... I love this one the customer service is always great and we never wait to be seated very long if at all...."}
{"text":"Have only been to the bar/lounge area a few times. Service is sort of slow, place is always a little dirty. Food is ok, nothing I would go out of my way for. It can get VERY crowded during happy hour, but that's the point!"}
{"text":"First time I had a great waitress, food was good, fast and I left with a smile on my face. Second time the waitress was.........horrendous. It was very slow, she had 2 tables, but half the time I had to ask another waiter for things, because she was nowhere to be seen. Asked her for bbq sauce, TEN MINUTES later still no sauce. I asked another waiter and he had it to me in 3 seconds. Then when we were finshed she shows up with the sauce.  So I asked for my check, she brought it, I put my card in the folder and it took her 10+ minutes to come pick it up.   I'm kind of afraid to go back, because I do not want to get her again and I'm not so rude as to ask for someone else right in front of her. Maybe next time I'll just do the bar"}
{"text":"I have always has absolutely amazing service at this location. The food never takes a crazy amount of time to receive. My drink never reaches half empty before another is brought. The servers are all friendly and have smiles on their faces. I always order the same thing.. Crispy chicken crispers.. sides are corn on the cob and homestyle fries. I usually sub out the fries for steamed broccoli. The chipotle sauce is a perfect addition to the crispers. Chili's is one of favorite places to go when we are out that way because of the service."}
{"text":"Seems like there is a new menu every time I visit a Chili's. Now they have express lunch specials and combinations and you can even pay the bill at the table, which was probably the highlight of this lunch visit. On this visit we had screaming Mexican kids and one angry old man who became upset after I was listening to my conference call on speaker. It didn't end well for that guy as I put him in his place considering this Chili's is piping in music during your meal. As for the food, it was 8 bucks for a mini order of fajitas and a small salad for the starter. Nothing special with the salad and the fajitas were a mess of overcooked onions and peppers and below average chicken strips. They give you a few tortillas and sour cream and pico, but everything is kind of a half portion for lunch. Chil's are better in area's where there are less choices, but in the Valley, you really don't need to eat here with our wide range of better places and chains."}
{"text":"Very friendly, very good food and clean.  Cheese fries, cheese sticks, quesadillas and pizza were all good.    Con. Cold in their they needed to turn heat on."}
{"text":"Cam in for a quick late lunch. Jennifer was our server. She did a great job. She was friendly and sincere."}
{"text":"Staff is always super friendly--Erin is the best!! Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"I often meet people here.  They can handle a larger group and there is plenty of variety on the menu.  It is a chain with advertising on the table and cookie cutter atmosphere, but if its not broke don't fix it.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Really slow service. More than fifteen minutes to have someone ask us for drinks. We downed them. No one came by for ten minutes to refill them. Finally got a different server, this time male, who was very quick.   Food came out. Everything fried had a plastic like taste. Like someone cut the plastic bag open of frozen pickles and accidentally tossed in the cut plastic into the fryer. This resulted in a very weird taste and I couldn't finish my dish.   Lot of negative reviews for this place just in the last thirty days alone. Pretty obvious why now."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by here before shopping at the outlet. Service was good, food was ok. Though I have to give them credit for their lava cake. At any chili's I usually finish my meal off with a lava cake and theirs was pretty good. Chocolate oozing out was hot but not too hot, the cake was moist, and the ice cream serving was generous. I left happy for sure."}
{"text":"There's too many restaurants in this area that are better than this Chilis. The food is mediocre & the place looks dirty. The glass next to our booth was covered in greasy hand prints. Go to Carrabbas or even K & W Cafeteria. At least there you can see the food before you order it."}
{"text":"Seriously, f#ck this place.  Came in tonight at 8, and stood at the hostess stand for about ten minutes.  Servers walked past us, and ignored us. The bartender also ignored us.   Out of no where... a guy in a cut off sleeve shirt walked up to us. No name tag, honestly looked like he belonged working out at the gym.... sat us in the bar.  We are handed menus, and wait. 2 servers walk past us, one even sits at the table in front of us.  No one says, just a minute.... or ill be right with you.... nothing.  One out of our group went to the bathroom and didnt even get to go, because they were appalled at how disgusting and dirty it was.  No . Way. We got up and left."}
{"text":"It was expensive, but then again it's at the airport so what do you expect. Apparently if you order just a side of fries you get a full container. It took a bit of time to get our order. It's located by D gates next to Starbucks"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Chili's for many years and this was the WORST experience I have ever had.  My parents and my sister's family were visiting from out of town. We went to Reed's Mine in North Charlotte and were hungry when we left so went to a supposed \"safe\" place.  My sister and I ordered 2 different salads (buffalo chicken salad and quesadilla explosion salad).  The lettuce was old, wilted, and bad. It was the worst salad ever!! My dad ordered the old timer's burger and there was almost no burger. We had 7 people in our party and each menu selection was awful!!  We had selected Chili's because of the consistency of the menu (no matter which restaurant selected)  Not sure if they had new or bad cooks but it certainly changed our minds about Chili's.  Not sure if I'll ever go back!! Very Disppointed"}
{"text":"The slowest service ever!! I just ordered the bottomless soup salad, and my mom ordered a chicken sandwich.  Salads were done and we were both still waiting for soup and sandwich..."}
{"text":"im usually a chili's fan but this one just was a disappointment! the wait was long to be seated like a 20 min wait. then the chick seating us just pointed a some dude that was to be our waiter. so we wait like feels for 10 mins just for the dude to toss some silverware, which half of them were dirty napkins and wet ones rolled up! then waited more for drink order, then he seemed uber effin pushy to make us put our dinner order in with the drink order, i was like WTF dude take a chill. then got our chips and salsa, which weren't even warm and like a hand full just tossed in a bowl, then we had to flag down another waiter to ask for more chips and drinks since this fool was no where to be found. then got our food, mine was luke-ass warm, i was temped to make them go warm it up but i was so dang hungry since waiting since the dawn of time to even get a drink i just ate some of it. this place was super busy don't know if its always like this or just a fluke for a friday night but i will diffidently pass on this place again! such a disappointment since my kiddos love chilis for their birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent service from Kat, got the 2 for 20 deal, and had a coupon for free guacamole w/chips. It was a busy Saturday lunch crowd, and everything was perfect! Gret experience!"}
{"text":"I love Chili's, and go there fairly often.  My favorite food is their burgers -- especially their BBQ burger (with onion ring).  If you are on a diet, don't plan on saving calories here.  Even with their low-fat menu, you are still going to have to eat some big portions.  My .02 cents, go to Chili's and enjoy yourself.  Go back on the diet the next day.  This restaurant has fair service, quick seating, ample room for large parties, and generally is not too busy.  It is a good place to go for good food that doesn't break the bank."}
{"text":"I went to this location at 3PM on a Thursday to grab some food and do some work while I was waiting for my next appointment.  In order to do a little work I needed a booth with a power outlet.  I went into the bar and they said that the only table's with an outlet were in the dinning room.  So I went to the host/waiter and ask for a table with a power outlet.  I was then told that there wasn't a server in that section so I couldn't sit there.  I said that I needed a plug for my computer and that is when I was told that I would probably need to go somewhere else because they can't help me.  WOW!!  I was surprised they didn't want my business considering there was only like 4 tables sat in the whole restaurant.    So I went to Majerle's instead."}
{"text":"It's Chilli's.. come on now.  Always reliable to be consistently the same. Which is not a bad thing."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in after doing some shopping and we were really hungry so we decided to give the 2 for $20 a try but we decided to Ante Up! And get an appetizer, two entrees, two margaritas and a dessert for $35!  For starters let's get to the drinks! Yummy! Margaritas either frozen or on the rocks any flavor you want! I opted for the Pomegranate one on the rocks and my friend chose the frozen Strawberry. What I learned was when the bartender is your waiter...your drinks come out awesome! These were not all mix and no liquor she poured it in those drinks and they were awesome!   For our appetizer we tried the Texas Cheese Fries Topped with chili, jalapeños, green onions and finished with applewood smoked bacon. Served with ranch dressing. When you have bacon, cheese and fries how can you go wrong! My only complaint is that the portion size wasn't big enough! They were simply delicious but the little pan they bring them out in is a joke...especially when like us...you're starving!   For the meal, I chose the chicken fajitas...the fajitas came out hot and steaming just like I like them! The chicken was hot, flavor was good, came with 3 tortillas and a side of lettuce, cheese, pico de gallo and guac!   My friend chose the ribs...with the original sauce...the meat was practically falling off the bone and it was delicious! I knew that my friend enjoyed it because she always slapped my fingers away when I tried to get a second bite! Instead of the fries she chose the steamed broccoli which was a little dry, but edible.   The dessert seal the deal for us! We chose the brownie! it came with ice cream and a chocolate sauce....what more YUM!!! Needless to say we sent back an empty plate to the kitchen!!!   Overall, it was a great meal! Really enjoyed the \"ANTE\" up style!"}
{"text":"We just went there for lunch, normally they are great. Today it wasn't too busy but we sat and waited for our server.... and waited.... and waited... just gave up and left. Ridiculous. If you don't want business fine we'll gladly start going elsewhere."}
{"text":"My wife & I entered at the bar around 8:15pm on a Wednesday night. No bartender in sight. Just two other customers across from us.  Watched as several employees wandered in, discussed their personal lives, did not even look in our direction.  My wife left for a visit to the bathroom, which was clean (unlike the bar which was covered in crumbs and easily ranked a 7-8 on the nasty & sticky scale).  When she returned, we left, ungreeted, hungry, thirsty, and just about completely cured of our long time love for a restaurant chain that, at least at all of its remaining locations in Vegas, has lost all it's appeal."}
{"text":"Service is always great and my order always comes out correct after I alter it like crazy, great location."}
{"text":"This Chili's was less than impressive. First the waitress talked us out of the table side guacamole saying that the kitchen guacamole was just as fresh, it wasn't! I got the quesadilla salad the lettuce was limp and didn't taste fresh. My husband got the trio lunch, they forgot his chicken and the only thing hot on his plate was the corn and it was just ok. This is not a locational that we will visit again!"}
{"text":"I must say I've been skeptical about coming here because of the 3 star rating. I can say I've been pleasantly surprised and don't really see the source of everybody's complaints. The staff was really friendly and easy to talk to. Our waitress was absolutely incredible - she took the time to go through all the question we had and made sure we were satisfied about everything. The menu design is really nice and there's a lot to chose from. It's impossible not to find something you enjoy eating here. As an appetizer we went with 2 sliders, cheddar bites and fries pickles. Really tasty! For the main dish I went with a 10 oz Sirloin steak and fried shrimp with a side of fries and steamed broccoli. The shrimp was really tasty and the sirloin had insane caramelization on the outside but still cooked to my liking (rare). What really got my attention was the automated checkout system. Great job Chillis, you got me as a long term client!  Try this location, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"They've revamped their menu to be more tex-mex and subsequently, there are less things than I would normally see that I can eat. I do not do spicy. It seems like everything on the menu is spicy! Of course, they can hold the jalapeños so you can just get some regular cheese fries. Those come out on a skillet and are deleeeshious.  I ordered a combo of baby back ribs and a sirloin medium rare with mashed potatoes  (I wanted the salmon but they had \"spicy\" in the description) and I'm not gonna lie I was pretty disappointed.  My steak was well done and had zero flavor. Like, no seasoning at all. The rubs were okay and the mashed potatoes obviously were mashed potatoes but I was so reminded of hospital food with the steak that I felt nauseous and couldn't eat. The manager was very nice and comped part of the meal, after offering to try another steak. I had some of my boyfriends burger which he loved. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong things? I'll try the \"spicy salmon\" next time and update!"}
{"text":"Went here for a nice lil family dinner, from the beginning our server wasn't attentive at all. Took a while to get our drinks on top of that the sodas all tasted nasty. Like the machine was broken and they were serving carbonated water even after they said they changed the soda. Finally gave up after tasting 3 different ones. Then a waiter (not ours) brought us chips n salsa  (someone else's order) even after we told him we didn't order them they gave them to us and tried to charge us for them in the end. There mistake. For the main meal it was honestly not even worth it. Food was cold, ribs were like rubber. The steak was highly undercooked supposed to be medium well. After giving us our food the waiter disappeared, didn't try to see if everything was okay. Everyone was too busy to assist. In all we should have just got up n left everything and went somewhere else. Not a good meal at all, they should care about pleasing the customers even if they have to fix everything we ordered. Should have got it right and HOT the first time.!"}
{"text":"Went in sat at the bar.... after 10 minutes of trying to find even a half clean spot. Plates litter the bar. Bartender in lala land took some time to acknowledge us. Chips and Salsa undercooked. Pool of grease under the chips. Half of the beers on tap not available."}
{"text":"Ordered a buffalo chicken salad. This was absolutely the worst restaurant salad I've ever had. Loaded with bagged iceberg lettuce. Almost zero other ingredients listed on the menu. Stone cold chicken that tasted two weeks old. Beware of this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Chili's in quite some time, so I was pleasantly surprised to see changes in their menu. The smokehouse combos are a nice option, with big portions enough to split the meal. Their street corn is really good, you can tell it's fresh not frozen. Service was wonderful, we were kept hydrated, and any special requests were fulfilled, nothing was forgotten and everything came out at once, no waiting for a meal."}
{"text":"Our waiter Shawn was awesome. He apologized for the wait at the door and when I told him I was on hold for 15 minutes to get on the call ahead list but downloaded the app and did it faster he apologized for that even though he had nothing to do with that either. He got us our drinks and appetizers very quickly and the food came out right the first time. Someone needs to recognize him for his superb customer service skills and his friendly attitude and his quickness. Definitely will come back here again because of him."}
{"text":"I have not eaten here yet, but was so touched by the manager Tim's chivalrous action I had to put in a note.  I had a flat tire nearby and quickly parked in the Chilis lot so I was safe for the AAA driver.  It was in the mid-morning so the restaurant wasn't open yet.  Tim came out to check on me, assured me that I wasn't in the way and generally made my day. He offered water and if I needed anything to come inside.  He even offered to change the tire if I hadn't called AAA!! What a gentleman.  THANK YOU!!"}
{"text":"Took a significant amount of time, food came cold and dry. Waitress was great and extremely pleasant. Was disappointed because I am an avid Chili's lover and this was below my normal expectations."}
{"text":"Horrible service All we ordered was a bowl of soup and and an appetizer to share and waited 40 minutes! Then when the appetizer came out we had requested no ranch on the sliders, they actually had the nerve to scrap the ranch off the sliders and bring them back to us!! Never got a refill or an apology for the screw up This Chilis is always a bad experience"}
{"text":"I've not been thrilled by Chili's in my neighborhood the past few years but since my friend and I were near one I had never visited we decided to give it a try. First off we noticed the Health Dept rating was much better than our neighborhood location. We were greeted effusively by a vivacious hostess named Vickie. She welcomed us and asked our preference for seating then cleared a booth herself to seat us. We waited a little longer than we expected for our waiter Ricky but another staff member stopped by to let us know Ricky was aware of us and would be present shortly. Our beverages were ordered and delivered in a timely manner. The menu was easy to follow and or order was out quickly and hot. The vegetables were fresh and crisp on our burgers and sandwiches. We loved the REAL tasye of the french fries...they actually tasted like potatoes!  We received refills on our beverages regularly. If you're using debit or credit card for payment a small device on the  table allows you to do that yourself so your card never leaves your hands. Our meal experience was pleasant and satisfying. We left feeling good about our choice."}
{"text":"Normal chilis. Decent food and atmosphere. It wasn't too busy at 8am but it did take awhile for our chip refill for some reason.   I ordered carnival fajita and the waiter made sure I knew that was pork. Kinda weird. I assumed most people know what carnitas is. Made an awkward moment.    Also they don't have the caddy for quac, cheese, salsa like most Chili's do. They put it on a small plate instead.  Overall good."}
{"text":"Everything on the Chili's menu is good.  Probably my most favorite chain restaurant out there.  Margaritas and desserts are both delicious too.  Skillet queso is always a must.  This particular location had a great happy hour (all day Sunday) and the bartender was fantastic.  Can't wait to no longer be pregnant so I can get a presidente margarita again!!  Yummmm!  My husband and I actually met working at a Chili's in California 11 years ago.  We never get tired of their food."}
{"text":"Did the two for $20 deal.  I had the 6 oz.  light sirloin and it was cooked perfectly and was very juicy. They were a little slow bringing out the appetizer,  but not to slow that our dinner beat it out. We didn't say anything,  but the waitress apologized and when our bill came the manager came over and said she took some money off because they were slow getting our appetizer out.  Amazing!  That's customer service - when you don't even have to ask!"}
{"text":"Food quality is terrible. Seems like all the servers have some type of face piercings which seems inappropriate when in the food industry. All I can think of is Hep C. Very dirty restaurant and bathroom was unkept. Never saw a manager and it took 27 mins to get our drink order from the bar....on a slow day!"}
{"text":"Horrible Horrible Horrible. Bad service. Bad food. Long wait times. It's in the airport tho so i'll give them some slack and not give them one star, because i really want to give them one star"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to read a lot of negative reviews because my experience was a good one, other than a couple of glitches.   I had the santa fe chicken salad that was really good. The chicken was a little tough but very good. They have this cool little box called ziosk. It has games and other apps to play which was good since i was dining alone. I played some trivia and was better than being on my phone. Getting the bill and seeing the 99 cent charge on it was surprising. They should tell you that before you start playing.   All in all a good experience. My waitress Elva was good."}
{"text":"Came to Chili's tonight for an easy night with my daughter. Upon sitting down the first thing noticed was that the booth was dirty. Sadly I was rather disappointed over all! The service was slow or non-existent, not just with our table. The food was slow to come out and VERY bland! At the end when our server did come up to talk with us the Manager rudely interrupted making the server walk away. No one wore nametags either!"}
{"text":"Veterans Day Fail 0*s chilis on metro you ignored us we had to ask for a waiter after 15 min Food was Old they DO NOT honor veterans I will never return here. I advise any military not to as well you will be treated like CRAP. Watch out they charge u to play trivia n do not disclose it until u pay this place is fraud!"}
{"text":"This location is good theres some great girls in the bar. But Chillis keeps shifting there image and redoing there menu. I simply cannot keep up. Everytime I get sold on our new yummy item. I start coming in regularly and poof that new shiney menu is old news and now we have something new.   Make up your mind on what kind food you want to serve."}
{"text":"Limited menu options, pretty good service. No deals doesn't accept coupons and please look at my queso picture"}
{"text":"I love Chili's. My husband and I always go for the 2 for $20 deal at whatever Chili's location we may be, but this location seemed to skimp out on the proportions quite a bit. I'm not sure if that's a new rule for the 2 for $20 or what, but we were still hungry after our meal, and I'm usually stuffed!   We both ordered a half-rack of ribs with fries. My ribs didn't have much meat on them, and seemed a little overcooked and dry. And for some reason, my plate had more fries in it than my husband's. Maybe they were looking for a balance? Haha! Said fries were also too salty.  The service was good, our waiter was very friendly. It was a busy night, so he took a while to get us a few things, but that's understandable.  On the bright side, the appetizer was excellent. I absolutely love their grilled corn guacamole!"}
{"text":"Santa Fe Chicken Salad was the bomb......and our waitress and server were very nice.  Lynnette and I had a great time."}
{"text":"I can count the number of times I've dined at Chili's in my lifetime prior to this visit on two fingers, so you know it's certainly not my go to place. Unfortunately the Calgary airport is lame and this is the only sit down restaurant after security, so I had no choice but to eat here before my 9 hour flight.  I didn't really expect much and it ended up being better than expected (back handed compliment?) Our server was super perky and pretty quick. There was a solo man at a table beside us who was very rushed for time and she suggested some meals that would come out more quickly than others and explained that fried things would take longer than, say, a side salad.  I ordered a chicken burger and my husband had a beef burger, both with fries. They only took 8 minutes to get to our table. There was nothing wrong with the taste at all. Again, better than I expected them to be."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to this location for years so we have seen the good,the bad,and the ugly here. Unfortunately this location has gone down hill in customer service. We walk in and wait about 5 minutes until a younger girl walks in, in her uniform while FaceTiming on her phone after she stands there for a minute I ask \"do we seat ourselves\"? Her reply while still face timing \"um no host will seat you\" with an attitude in her voice. So we wait he comes over and finally seats us the server was great I wished I remembered her name. However my advice if you're in uniform don't stand at the host stand while face timing on your phone whether you're new or not it's not a good look for the rest of the staff. You're the first person and first impression customers see. Our food was okay I've definitely tasted it hotter and not as bland when we first started coming here. I shouldn't have to soak my food in ranch to make it taste better. Wished I could rate you higher however my husband and I have made the choice to not return there's plenty of other places around our house to enjoy."}
{"text":"I decided to stop by for a quick bite after I was done shopping at the mall and was very disappointed with my experience.  I sat at the bar and there didn't appear to be a bartender working.  A waitress took my order from the outside of the bar and she wasn't very friendly.  The condition of the bar itself was disgusting.  There were racks from a cooler on top of the bar and no, not at the back of the bar.  They were lying on top of the bar as soon as you walked in along with a pile of crumbs that had not been wiped up from a previous customer.  There was also a smell of stagnant water eminating from behind the bar and it looked like noone had wiped down behind the bar in a long time.  Standing water/beer was on the counter behind the bar.  Overall, it just looked bad.  Coming from someone with restaurant experience, I found the appearance of the bar unappealing and unappetizing.  Empty glasses stayed on the bar for at least 20 minutes after a customer would leave.  The place was not busy so no excuse for this."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Chili's in a while. So me and the wife went for dinner. Hardly no wait, the server was polite and courteous. My wife had the frijitas and I had the ribs. We had chips and salsa while waiting for our food . Chips and salsa were good fresh and tasty, my wife liked her frijitas chicken and shrimp. My ribs were tender and meaty but the corn on cob was just barely warm. Overall a good experience. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Appetizer took forever,  then one entree comes out and mine was either forgotten or taken to another  table.  Restaurant was pretty dead when we arrived which left us wondering why the waitress was so unattentive .  It appeared  she chose to avoid us due to the fact that are  food  was taking forever. Manager comped my meal but it was a horrible dining  experience and I usually  like chili's won't be returning to this location. Your better off eating at a hot dog Stand!"}
{"text":"WOW!! What a Horrible experience!!! I have been eating at this Chilies for about 20 years now! I've always had a good to pretty good experience, but this time it was just Horrifying!!!   The food came out tasting awful! We are Done giving Chili's a chance! We will NOT be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is ran horribly.  I showed up at 9:10pm for a pick up that was supposed to be ready at 8:55. I got my food at 9:40. While waiting I saw the kitchen was a disaster. I over heard 2 servers using some pretty questionable language.  I called the manager on the phone right after and he said \"were not busy there should not have been a wait\" he also said \"I didn't know any of this I was in the back\".  Get out to the floor and manage your restaurant sir."}
{"text":"I am sad to give just two stars. I love chillis. Like I'd eat here every day if I could. I came on my lunch break so I had a limited amount of time. I sat for 10 to 15 minutes and even walked up to the bar before anyone came by to take my order.  Food came over 20 mins later, ordered the chicken sandwich w/fries. Fries were rock hard but hot so I dealt with it. Sandwich was good. Never even got a refill on my iced tea. Oh well. I still love chillis just not this experience."}
{"text":"I love the happy hour! My son loves the ribs and steaks!  We always have fun after school here.  I am a fan! and It's so convenient too by the supermarket."}
{"text":"We were seated right away but the waitress took awhile to acknowledge us. We both had the fajitas with rice and beans. The fajitas were good the rice was bland and cold the beans were good too. Overall good but the rafters are really dusty. So glad we didn't sit under them. The dust is ready to fall in someone's meal."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat. We frequent both the one on Bell and West Point Parkway and Lake Pleasant Mall at Happy Valley Rd and Lake Pleasant Parkway.  Friendly service, excellent food, fabulous deserts and last but not least, great margaritas.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"If you order from a chain restaurant and use their online order options, the items on the menu should be available. I got an automatic email confirmation of my order and a phone call saying \"we are out of that\". Why would the kitchen managers, the general manager, or the owner of that particular location allow that to happen. Was anyone paying attention?"}
{"text":"Gross food.. bad service, Fajitas are a joke. This place isn't even good as a last result. I'd rather go to DelTaco instead. .save your time and money and go somewhere else, manager could care less about producing a quality product, said that's how corporate wants it. Well then corporate can eat here, ill never come back..."}
{"text":"Definitely not my favorite Chili's. If you go in between the hours of one and four, the place is dead, and it takes on average 15 minutes for someone to even appear at the bar to take your order. Service is slow, slow, slow. I assume the place has poor management because the servers all look like they would rather be anywhere else. Other than that, The food is predictable, since it's corporate fare. I much prefer the location at arrowhead over this one"}
{"text":"Showed up at 1:00 on a Wednesday afternoon and had a 30 min wait to be seated.  Was finally seated at a half cleaned table.  We asked for a kids menu and they said they were out and our kid needed order off the adult menu.  I ordered coffee and they said their machine was broken and they didn't plan on it being fixed soon.   My wife ordered fajitas and he said it would be at least a 25 min wait on them because the kitchen was behind.  Our server never brought our daughters lemonade and when we got the check and brought it up he said \"I was wondering where that lemonade went that I made earlier and forgot to bring out\".  Our drinks remained empty most of the meal and he never refilled our bottomless chips and salsa.  While eating our meal another  waitress walked by mumbling \"stupid people\" loins under breath as she grabbed a high chair for a couple with a infant. The table behind us was covered in dishes for most of our meal.  It would of been better if our waiter was apologetic but he was arrogant and unpleasant."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times recently and they seem to have a decent thing going for them. We had a good waiter who was willing to make some recommendations when we ordered the $20 dinner for 2. Overall it seemed to be a good value. The \"fried cheese\" that we ordered is just a clever name for cheese sticks (and not many of them). I think from some of our finer dining experiences we were imagining something a little more unique and less Giant Eagle freezer section. Our waiter recommended the Crispy Chicken Crispers. They were prepared well and the sauce was good.   There was a stink bug that was crawling across the booth as we ate, but the waiter I spoke to did not hesitate to remove it. Bonus points for handling it professionally.   Overall the food is just A-OK, hence the \"A-OK\" rating. It's a good place to go with friends when you need lunch or an easy dinner option."}
{"text":"The place was very dirty, we sat looking at a table full of dirty dishes the entire time we were there. A girl was sweeping or what should have been sweeping however she was missing everything.  Stuff all over the floor. My wife ordered the fajitas and they waited ten minutes to come and tell her they were out of beef. I also have a problem with them charging for \"table entertainment\" for the use of the tablet at the table, no where does it say you will be charged for its use. That should be illegal!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible management. Seriously lacking in customer service. I called in a to go order of 3 for me (salad, 1/2 size fajitas and dessert) and added full size fajitas only to realize that I had my $10 gift and $3 on me and had left my debit card in my other purse. So once there I asked to change my order back to the 1/2 size fajitas. No problem. The problem occurs when I left and was half way home and realized my chicken and veggies were cold. Not cooled down after being hot, but cold like taken out of the refrigerator and sat out for a hour cold. I called and spoke with the \"manager\" Mike and he was absolutely RUDE. R. U. D. E. He blamed it on me, saying it's because I didn't have enough money to pay for my order so they had to take the time to change it and he kept interrupting me while I was speaking. Then he told me to bring them back and they'll redo them. Really?? After telling me I didn't have enough money to pay, he wants me to bring the cold food back and trust them to made my food correctly and not do something bad to my food?? Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Stopped visiting any and all Chili's restaurants about 10 years ago due to the lack of service and the quality of their food having gone way down. With that said, my husband and I hesitantly decided to have lunch there not too long ago and Dang! It was pretty good.... Couple of weeks later, we went back for dinner and I must say.........It took me back to when I was younger and this was a \"cool\" place to go.  Very happy :-)"}
{"text":"This a good spot, the atmosphere is usually good, and the food is mostly always fresh. The fajitas are off the hook, and they have lots of great appetizers. I'm a huge fan of the Southern Smokehouse burger, and the Honey Chipotle ribs are a must try. All in all it's good neighborhood restaurant/bar to bring the friends or family."}
{"text":"Not a great lunch at usually reliable Chili's. They have these lunch combo deals, but most aren't full servings and the prices are either $6-$8.  The choices are limited and my first choice was unsuccessful. I would skip the opening salad and go for soup because the salad was dreadful with the croutons being the highlight. I had to return the new Chipotle Chicken Bowl thingy because the strips of chicken were full of fat and this was one of the worst renditions of a bowl meal, plus it wasn't even in a bowl. Anyway, I went for the $6 BLT and that was two strips of bacon, shredded lettuce and one tomato on the ole pretzel bun (it is half a sandwich). The fries were good and Melissa was a nice bartender, but no more lunch at Chili's, even though the price was only $6.50 total."}
{"text":"Went here tonight and had either glass or plastic in my food. They took down my name and number incase I needed to visit the hospital and gave us our meal free. I'm still upset about the carelessness the cooks had to allow that to happen."}
{"text":"For being on the strip & in the outlet shopping center they have very good service & the food is always delicious. The waits can be long but they do call ahead seating which is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Service today  is half ass,    We sit down in the bar area  waited for about 3 or 4 min  a group behind us come and sits down  and the get greeted  by the server we wait another min still noservice  so we get  and go to the dinning get area..  there are 4 servers walking by and the manager  looking from  the kitchen 2 min goes by. Still no .. Hi, I'll be with with you, give me a min, let me put this down,  nothing... so finally  our server appear  and we order..  To add it not like the old days  2 or 3 months ago where they greet you and acknowledge  you are there . I'll just leave it there......."}
{"text":"we came about 4pm  on a Wed. We waited about 7min before anyone actually came to help seat us. The workers saw us standing there but, did not choose to come over to us. We were seated at a table and chairs that were so snuggly in the corner that if they sat people In the other table they would not be able to sit comfortable. The girl who sat us was rude and just tossed our menus on the table. The table was sticky and there was food in between the tiles of the table. We waited about 10min for the waitress to come take a drink order or even food order. Mind you it was NOT busy. We ordered our drinks, appetizer and food.  For appetizer we order the artichoke dip and chips. it was very good but the one thing is the dip comes in a small cast iron pan and they have a little pot holder on the handle. That pot holder was dirty with who knows what all over it. I pushed it off with my napkin.  We ordered the Pretzel bun chicken sandwiches which were very good.  Its sad to say that the food was really good but, the staff and the cleanliness of the place is a major turn off."}
{"text":"Good food. Good environment. Nothing crazy, it's just Chili's. Ordered Table Side Guacamole which was pretty good. Like that they ask you what you want on it before just putting it in the guacamole. Also got Mango Chile-Chicken which was sweet with a kick of fire. Asked server for double rice and plate came out hot and delicious."}
{"text":"I think it's only fair that I update my review. Decided to give this place a second chance mainly because I was feeling lazy and this location is close to my house. Came in for a drink, we sat at the bar are and the bartender immediately came around and ask if we wanted to orders drinks. I believe he said his name was Gordon, kudos to you. I'm pretty sure is not easy having to keep up with the bar itself but you were also keeping up with your tables around."}
{"text":"And now I remember why I don't come to this chilis Not busy enough for them to be giving this slow of services. Wait time was too long for them having so many open tables. Waiting over 20 minutes for an appetizer that is just chips and salsa is ridiculous. Our server didn't even bother to ask if we needed refill but just rudely walked by to say she is bringing refills and never did. Seriously over this place and will never return  Not worth it"}
{"text":"We were on our way to BJs Brewery when I spotted Chili's. My nephew wanted hamburgers and since I hadn't been to Chili's in a long time, we decided to stop in. Well, I remember now why I stopped eating there. The food is so salty. I can barely eat it. I had the trio with the egg rolls, cheese bites and hamburger sliders. Never again. Chili's, you might want to consider cutting the salt in half. Even my 12 year old nephew thought the cheese balls were too salty. I also don't like the table top kiosks, I think they are a distraction and get in the way."}
{"text":"Good was pretty good, but the service wasn't the best. We had two waiters, but still ended up having to grab other waiters attention who were not our own in order to even get drinks or refills"}
{"text":"Three stars so yea, meh.  Decent food and good menu selection, but nothing amazing.  Fast enough and friendly enough service.  The problem is the prices are high considering this is a run of the mill place. It's nice that you can pay your bill on the tablet they set in front of you, but annoying that the games aren't free on it. I'm already dropping $30 for dinner, so give me a  game of plants vs zombies on the house while I wait, dammit."}
{"text":"Always good, a lot of bang for the buck, good atmosphere, friendly people and much to choose from"}
{"text":"The new prime rib meals are grease balls.  We used to love the old timer but not that is too greasy to finish.  They changed their menu and its not the same.  I won't be returning, I can get better food from the frozen section in the grocery store,"}
{"text":"Love the bottomless chipps/salsa and the queso dips.  I ordered a steak that had bacon on it and it was very good.  I have always enjoyed Chilis and this was just another good experience.  Good food, good service, good times."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS CHILIS. The service was absolutely phenomenal! Rebecca was our server and it was like we were guests in her home. You could tell she loved her job and it made us love being there. We will definitely be back (:"}
{"text":"If I could give my visit last night a zero I would. First of all the context. I am the father of three teenagers and we don't always have the money to go on special outings, etc. We happened to have some extra money and the kids wanted to go out for dinner just with me, so it was a special occasion for all of us. My kids said that Chili's was where they wanted to go. Where do I begin, our visit was like we were in the Twilight Zone. First, we were told the wait for a table would be 15 minutes (turned out to be 30). Half of the tables were empty, which we overlooked assuming that there were some call outs and they may have been short staffed. Next, we sat at the table for 15 minutes without seeing a server. I had to go find a manager to get anyone to our table. When the server finally showed up he took our drink order and we went ahead and ordered. There were for of us so we got two of the 2 for $22 deals (each comes with an app). When were ordered drinks we were told that there was no soda or tea, only water. At this point we should have walked out, but we all ordered water and let it slide. When the server brought the water out it was overflowing and all four glasses spilled all over the table, the server said nothing. Our first app came out (fried pickles). about 20 minutes laster here comes our food. My two girls had ordered a chips and salsa that NEVER came out. I asked about this to the lady who brought or food out and she said she would check on it. I told her that our food was already out and that would defeat the purpose of an appetizer, we just would like the app taken off our check. In ten more minutes the manager came by and said, \"I went ahead and took the chips off your check.\" He didn't apologize and acted as if he were doing me a favor for taking something off the check WE NEVER RECEIVED. The food was also sub par. Three of our chicken crispers were missing sauce. The original crispers seemed soggy. There was no pepper on the corn on the cob as usual. At this point I should also mention that our drinks (and I mean water) had been empty for about 15 minutes. It wasn't till we were done with our food that our server came by and my kids ASKED for a refill, even though we were finished. He NEVER came by the entire time to check if we needed refills. I told him we needed the check, the ziosk machine at our table was not working. He brought the ticket and we thought the nightmare was over. Wrong. I checked the bill to make sure the chips were not on there, they weren't. However, there was a $2 charge for \"table entertainment\". I went to the manager to ask him what this was. He said, \"oh, thats for games you bought on the kiosk machine\". At this point I am about to lose it. I asked him, how the hell could I buy games from a ziosk machine that isn't even working? It seemed that they were trying to sneak that in to make up for the chips that they didn't charge us for that we didn't get. He said he would \"take that off for me too\", again, like he was doing me a favor. He acted like I was annoying him. It took another ten minutes to get the corrected check. Needless to say, we will NEVER EAT AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN.  And if anyone is reading this, I am not a bot or paid \"Yelper\". I am a real person. If fact, you can see for yourself. My twitter handle is @TheRealCSW76."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight was great. We used the app to check in on our way, and only had to wait a few minutes for a table. Our waiter Tanner was great. Very attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"As always the fajitas were great. Our waitress was good and friendly. Only problem we had was the restaurant was loud and noisy and it took asking 2 people to clean our plates off our table so we could enjoy and share a desert. Gentleman that brought out the desert acted like he didn't know where to set the desert down at because there was no room on the table. We're guessing he could have picked up plates and took them away, but didnt."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed I even went here, but I was starving and it was right next to where I was. All I wanted was a burger. This place blows! I got the double cheeseburger lunch combo with salad. My husband got a black bean burger. The salad was tiny and disgusting. My double burgers stacked on top of each other weren't even close to the size of my husband's vegetarian burger! They were so dry and burnt. Worst burger of my life. I can say this with complete honesty: I would have been much more satisfied with McDonalds. That's saying something. The only reason I gave this place two stars is because our server was very friendly."}
{"text":"My coworkers and myself ordered food today for lunch and Chili's had 5 lunch items missing.  They hung up on me twice when I tried to call them to let them know.  They would not do anything to make it right.  They didn't even apologize.  The Manager \"Daniel\" said that we had to call postmate and they will not get involved. So needless to say we will not be ordering from this Chili's again."}
{"text":"When I walk through the door they had the manager and host did not know what the f*** they were doing didn't even acknowledge and they were trying to figure out where to sit people and they weren't really paying attention to the front of the house."}
{"text":"Holy nastiness.... When Im hungover and hungry waiting for a flight, I'm usually not that picky! It's rare that I don't eat food that's in front of me when I'm hungry. This \"breakfast\" food was so friggin nasty.. I thought for sure, \"can't go wrong with Chili's, let's grab something there\".. Wrong!!!  The \"hash browns\" were old, stale cut up fries reheated. The bacon was that stringy, thin crap they put on burgers. The toast was barely toasted, thin, and cold. The eggs were even cold. Yuckkkkk... a pre-packaged sandwich from the sports bar would have been better. Anywhere in that airport has to be better- Cinnabon, BK... Whatever you do, avoid this Chili's at all costs. On top of the food being disgusting, they served it with plastic forks and knives... Really??!! I couldn't even get through my rubbery egg with that chinsy fork."}
{"text":"-- VETERAN'S DAY DINNER --  Decided to try out Chili's right after Applebee's on Vet's day.  Again my mentality on free food: A corner has to be cut from somewhere to damage control not breaking even on the inventory.  The Chili's menu wasnt as robust as the Applebees, there was a burger, a salad, a taco, a pasta and a chicken dish. We didnt want to hit up Chili's originally because other then the burger everything was a chicken dish.  Celebrating Vet's day and it's a free dinner so what the hell.   Ordered the Chicken Margarita and WOW. The beans were delicious, seasoned to perfection. Normally i hate any kind of bean dish because i've been tormented with boiled beans with no flavor when i was younger but beans that get a seasoning treatment, superb.    The chicken itself didnt have a lasting flavor to it, you pretty much forgot what it's suppose to taste like after the first chew. But it was VERY tender. Cut with a fork tender and this is a piece of butterflied breast meat.  At the end we decided to order a chocolate lava cake dessert because we all drank water and the meals were free and none of us carried cash for the tip.  The dessert was about average. Cant say much about chocolate cake with ice cream on top that oozes chocolate out."}
{"text":"Worst chili's location. Incapable of putting together a to go order without leaving something out. To top this off our last ordered they sent out a steak that was purple and raw inside. It was close to closing when we ordered so were already closed when I got the order home and found out they had so badly under-cooked my food. We brought it back the next day and were told by the manager Mike that we needed to have brought it back last night after closing. Then he basically blamed us for not opening the box and cutting into it there at the to go counter. I told him, it is their responsibility to be sure this is correct, not mine and he said well I ordered medium rare and that what the steak was. The manager of a restaurant that serves steak cannot tell the difference between medium rare (warm red center) and raw (cold and purple in the center). I asked for the name and contact information for someone above him, and he got belligerent and kept again trying to blame us. He had offered coupons for a future visit (yeah right) but would not give us a refund. I have contacted the corporate office instead as they need to be trained on food preparation and service. Will not go back to this location again."}
{"text":"I know what your thinking, who goes to a chain restaurant  when there are so many festive options on the strip? Simple answer,we were in a hurry and didn't want fast food. We went to a concert at the T-Mobile arena. The polo towers within walking distance (literally 10 minute walk). I had this brilliant idea to try a new place, but the wait was 45 minutes and we were starving and crunched for time. We walked into chilies, sat at the bar and we're done in less than 40 minutes. Our server was friendly, helpful and quick. As we were walking there we enjoyed local vendors,performers and artist. Outside, a live reggae band was playing. At the bar, we enjoyed happy hour drinks and placed our cool beverages on the ice bar. We sat looking out on a picturesque view of the lights and people below on the strip. My wife and u shared a steak and chicken combo with veggies. The meat was cooked to perfection and the veggies hit the spot.   *** also, nearby (downstairs) is an alcoholic slushy bar and cheap 10.00 public parking I wish someone would have clued me into"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to grab some appetizers around 9:15pm, and hit the chilies up the street. We arrived at 9:22, waited to be greeted by the host, who walked up and said \"Oh.... hi, sorry, it's because we close in 20 minuets.\" My friend and I decided we would just leave because he seemed bothered that we arrived. As we walk out, we ask what time Applebee's across the street closes and he said \"They close at 2, we'll probably see you there after we close.\" My friend and I just left. We decided to write this review after talking about how we felt and laughed about his last comment. He literally made us feel unwelcome because he couldn't wait to come to the Applebee's across the street!"}
{"text":"I came on a Sunday at 10:50pm and on Google said that they closed at 12am and the guy said that they close at 11pm, It wasn't even 11pm and we couldn't eat... Awful customer service"}
{"text":"Chilis has really gone downhill over the years, as a franchise. So in saying this chilis location isn't as good as it once was is it a reflection of this location or the state of chilis itself? I dont know.  The greasy burger. Slathered with sauce on a soggy bun basically fell apart in my hands. The fries were pickled in so much salt in made them basically inedible. The chips and guac was acceptable but the guac recipe has changed for the worse.   I left without finishing half my meal."}
{"text":"I was amazed at the treatment received at this property. I'm not one to write a bad review but I'm sleepless due to such s horrible experience tonight.   My brother and I visiting my father. Due to kemo my father hasn't been out to dinner for months. Tonight he found the strength to join us on our last night here, potentially our last meal out with our father.  No one at this property knew if any of this but it should not matter.   The host that sat us was Madison. Madison sat us at the furthest table even passing 4 empty tables. Dad was a bit slow but really tried to move fast in his walker. Madison arrived at the table prior to us and had to wait for us with the menus. The table we sat at was wet with remains food prices remaining from the previous diners. Dad pulled out his handkerchief to dry the table as Madison is trying to put a menu in his hand. I told her the table was wet and still dirty. She apologized and continued to place menus in front of us. I lifted my menu up and gave it back to her and asked her for a towel.  She returned about 2-3 minutes later with a stack of napkins in which she handed to me to wipe and dry the entire table. Once I was done she literally threw four menus with all the inserts in the table and walked away.   Really Madison??  Why she wouldn't dry the table and recipe it down is my question and then to lose patience this way was amazing. The guests first contact was Madison.   We never did get the inserts straight so not all of us saw the entire menu.   The food was good everyone enjoyed the food. The service to receive drinks and the food was very much below average. After dinner we enjoyed nice conversation with our empty plates in front of us. They were never cleared off.   Lack of training and/ supervisory at this property and the corporate office really needs to see how negative this property is to the chilis brand name    Such a shame!!"}
{"text":"I usually love chilis but not today. My chipotle steak is good, the shrimp flavor was stale, the mash potato was good, asparagus was decent, service was friendly and fast...   Good place, just nothing amazing tonight which is not always bad.... right?"}
{"text":"I've avoided Chili's due to feeling like the food quality wasn't there. My BFF and I stopped in for a last minute Sunday lunch and were delightfully surprised.  Tney had hormone free hamburgers! The Southwestern crispy chicken salad was excellent. Her teenage son was didn't like the tacos. Angel happily replaced them with another item. Good food, great service, good location. We'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I were going to the Don Bluthe Theater later, so we decided to eat at Chili's before the play. They donate 15% of the food total to the theater if you mention you are going. My husband & I split a full rack of their original ribs, served with crispy fries. I must say I was completely surprised! The ribs were fall off the bone tender & juicy. Our friends had a large chicken salad, & her husband had a nice juicy hamburger, cooked to perfection. Prices are very reasonable & the service was great! I would definitely go back again! I assume this would be a pleasant place for lunch also."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Chili's in a long time this is the worst I ever been to the service is terrible the restroom is filthy and they don't even know how to present a drink without putting their fingers all over the top of the glass ask for a manager he said his name is Joey the most rude ignorant nasty manager I've ever met I've reported them to the company nothing is ever happen the food isn't good the service is not good and the restaurant is very very dirty I think the health inspector needs to come in and check this place out horrible horrible horrible"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to dinner here the other night.  We usually love coming here,  but this was the second time our visit and dinner was less than appetizing. We were rushed to order our appetizer and dinner along with our drinks,  the chips were extremely salty and our fries for both of our dinners were stale and cold. When brought more fries the same thing.  Our server treated us as though we were ruining her day.  Sad to say, we will not be coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"Whenever you want to sit at the bar and there is a short black haired female bartender working, you should probably leave. I usually do. She might greet you within 10 minutes, get your drink order and never ask you if you want food. You'll probably be done with your drink at least 10 min before she ever asks if you want another. And if you want to get your check, good luck. Disappears for 10 minutes at a time. Have seen numerous people walk out or pissed. Can't believe she still works here. I had to give her one more try and same ol same ol. Last time."}
{"text":"No stars...walked in and sat at the bar.  After s couple minutes I was told she would be with me in a minute. No greeting.  After several minutes she returned and  I asked for a beer list.  She seemed anoid and turned towards the taps and listed tghe all off too fast.  I then asked for a wine menu.  She gave me a menu and did not come back for about 10 min.  I walked out!  Poor service   the bar top was very dirty too!"}
{"text":"Fred's Playland gives them two thumbs up. Great overall experience. Especially considering we brought them a bus load. That can be extremely challenging. Michelle was more than accommodating. She was without a doubt the best host/manager we've ever had the pleasure of working with. She made us feel warm and welcome from the very first phone call. On top of that the food was fantastic and service was great. I'd recommend the Fahitas and the Lava Cake.  Everyone was pleased. Fred's Playland thanks Michelle and Chili's."}
{"text":"Ate lunch there earlier today. Food was good, but the service was exponentially worse. Our server, Gustavo, never came back to check on us for refills, my wife's drink was refilled by somebody that was not our server. He was not very attentive especially since there were not very many patrons in the restaurant. I don't enjoy writing bad reviews for bad experiences, but it's something I can't help if it's continuously occurring every where I go. An establishment like Chili's should have a higher standard of service since they are in the food industry. Unfortunately this is not the case. Probably will never eat her again and I will continuously and actively spread not good things about the service of this establishment and its entire company. Sorry but not sorry."}
{"text":"Really really delicious food burger was cooked medium rare first time I've had a burger directly cooked in a very long time drinks were good service is very nice very friendly"}
{"text":"Placed an order online and received a confirmation.  When I got there the girl behind the counter said it was only half done (note I arrived a few minutes past estimated pickup time).  She then proceeded to restate my order to me as it she was confirming it when In fact it was never entered into their system.  4 other families came and went with their orders while I sat there for 40 minutes. Mind you she said it was half done. Then the kicker.  They forgot one of the dinners. She counted out the containers which seemed right but someone in the kitchen put a side salad in a dinner container."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here right now and am receiving terrible service. Our server never looked looked us in the eye, we ate all of our appetizers with empty drinks (no refills), he never ordered my margarita, never brought me a side of honey mustard, and after waiting 20 minutes after finishing we had to ask another server for boxes and our check. It clearly seemed like our server was over his shift and ready to be cut. As a server, myself, I've never written a bad Yelp review but this is the worst service I've ever had. No Bueno Billy :("}
{"text":"I recently went there for lunch.  I was seated promptly, then forgotten about for a solid five minutes while other around me where taken care of by their servers.  They were seated after me.  When my server arrived I informed her that I felt forgotten.  Instead of apologizing, she blamed a large group as the cause of my delay.   Wrong.  It shows a systematic problem with their service training.  I will not be going back to this Chilis."}
{"text":"Don't ever go here for barbeque ribs because these were the absolute WORSE excuse for ribs I have ever had in my life. Hardly any sauce on them at all, and at least 70% bones. If you order a half a slap of ribs and you leave the restaurant still hungry, you know the ribs (or in this case, this sad excuse for what they call ribs) are mostly bone. Again, hardly any sauce, over cooked to the point that there was no moisture left in them.  I went with my family and the burger my sister in law had looked good, but I have never been so disappointed in a meal in a long, long time."}
{"text":"Awesome food, amazing service & great drinks! We haven't been to Chili's in at least a year & I absolutely love the new menu. Everything was top quality & priced reasonably. Our server was attentive & on point. Football on tv & a good vibe. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I'm loving the 2 for $20 deal - the steak and loaded potato are a good meal for the price."}
{"text":"My go to when I don't want to sit in a smokey bar to eat dinner.  Fast friendly service and good food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday because we were able to use a gift card we had. We were both very surprised at how yummy everything was. We were pleasantly pleased, and will definitely be going back. Great service, great food."}
{"text":"This place is ... literally A-OK.   Though I'd rather avoid going to places that make me feel like a cow when I walk out.... they do have some awesome deals.  I have a family of 4 and I definitely appreciate a good deal.   The latest deal to date would be the 2 full size entrees w/ a half order appetizer.  Makes eating out a lot cheaper than usual!  I really love the quessadilla explosion salad.  It's huge and has a lot going on.  I'm also a big appetizer for an entree kinda person and they offer all the usual fried goodness.    PS:  the last I came I had the fajitas and spelled like it for hours.    Overall, servers are very friendly.  You get a friendly welcome when you walk out the door, and we're always seated quickly.    We like to sit at the bar and catch the games... but it's not as clean as the general seating area.  Service is usually slower... but it is the bar.. so?  I guess?  IDK.  PS! red velvet shooters! YUM!"}
{"text":"The food was good I had the chipotle chicken mex salad and it was awesome. Surprised how good it was actually. I had a bite of the chicken bacon sandwich which was tasty also, I love the pretzel buns! I was very disappointed that there was no WiFi which I really don't understand how a big national chain doesn't have that. So I would definitely not go here for any football games. Overall I was surprised how good the food we had was but was strongly disappointed about the no WiFi."}
{"text":"It took 40 minutes for food after waiting 15 minutes (not unreasonable for a Saturday night). To and insult to injury our food was cold when it arrived.   If not for the good food and ambience they would get a 1 star."}
{"text":"Once you've been to one Chili's you have been to them all: Decent food, Decent price, Decent service. The good thing is you always know what you'll be getting, and there is something for everyone on the menu. This is just your run-of-the-mill Chilis', can't complain."}
{"text":"Well, now we have the 3 for $10 special deal and hopefully this stays on the menu as well because it was a good value. Soup or salad - baked potato soup (was tasty, but served warm, not hot) Entree - Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers - all white meat and the sauce had a nice kick that me sweat a bit in a good way. Served with good enough corn and fries Drink - anything non-alcohol is included, but I also tried the $5 triple tequila margarita. It went down fast, but had no effect on me. Probably better to stick to that grande thing they serve."}
{"text":"I love this location managers are so friendly and never fail to make your experience a great one. There was a woman (manager) and I wish I remembered her name, but she took such care of us when something wasn't right with our order. We've been to a few chilis and this by far is are absolute favorite location! Thanks for always keeping us happy. We sure will miss this location being that we moved recently :)"}
{"text":"Chili's has always been solid for me.  The service is always fast, the food is always acceptable and it is a great laid back place that my wife and I enjoy visiting.  Their fajitas are my go to order and the chicken quesadilla salad is my wife's go to.  Overall we really enjoy any chili's."}
{"text":"I've been here ever since I was little and it's always good. I've came with both family and friends and enjoyed it every time. The $2 for $22 is a must have! Also the texas cheese fries are great and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love chili's food, but this location has terrible and slow service, the water tasted disgusting and dirty, and the waitress walked past us about 10 times before even taking our drink order, then another 10 before taking our food order (we were ready when we ordered our drinks) the food was good, although the crust was burnt. Also, this place is filthy (see pictures)"}
{"text":"I went here on a whim, never having been to a Chili's before. Everything on their menu was pretty much fried and nasty. They cater to the lowest common denominator of food-shoveling American consumers. They might as well add \"bowl of ranch dressing\" as a side item.  I got tacos that tasted like they were rubbed in salt and artichoke dip that came with almost translucently greasy tortilla chips that, like the tacos, burned your mouth with saltiness.  What are you trying to do here? You know you can make money by freshly preparing food and letting the actual ingredients show through? Places like this are literally a disrespect to the human race. When you eat at a place like this, you tell restaurant boards that you enjoy having your food microwaved so it comes out fast and piping hot, that you'd rather taste massive amounts of seasonings, mainly salt, than actually taste the food, and that you'd much rather have something wrapped in grease and batter that is bite size and can be crammed in your mouth in quick succession.  Stop going to places like this and they'll actually improve their menu and put more emphasis on quality."}
{"text":"The food was OK nothing spectacular. I was not disappointed but then again it's a chain restaurant.  They have a new system called ziosk which allows you to reorder drinks, and food once your initial order has been placed and also allows you to pay your bill. Seriously is this what this SERVICE industry has come to!? The saddest part is that we have driven the industry with our inability to communicate with people face to face. I think we need to reconsider where we are going in this industry and bring personality and service back to the tables. Not to mention that this certainly hurts the tips! However our server Dawn was super and was not going to allow this ziosk to take away from giving her guests gratis service!"}
{"text":"================== RETURN VISIT UPDATE ==================  Came again Thursday night after a meeting I attended with nine other people. It was the same group of people I went with in my first review of this establishment.   The group was seated right away and our drink orders were taken. So why the low rating? Why? Because I ordered the Mango-Chile Tilapia. I took one bite and thought it was terrible. If you've seen my other reviews I normally like Tilapia so it wasn't the fish it was how the fish was prepared. It was cooked fine but the Mango-sauce with avocados on top was not appetizing.  At this point everyone in our party was served and enjoying their meals. I was waiting for the waitress to come around and ask if anyone needed refills or how was their food, But she was nowhere to be found. When she finally did come around everyone was just about finished with their meals. Then she asks about how everyone's food was. So I told her. Someone who I assume was a manger comes over and asks if I wanted her to have my meal recooked. At first I said no I just wanted it taken off my bill.. because everyone was already done.  After awhile I reluctantly agreed to having my meal recooked without the mango sauce TO-GO..Upon reflection I should have asked for the meal to be comp'd and be done with it.   FOOD: The food is exactly what you would expect from a Chili's Restaurant. :  SERVICE: I must admit for a large group we did receive good service. PRICE: The price  for the quality of food you receive is OK. AMBIANCE: It's like every other Chili's. CONCLUSION: When this sort of thing happens I don't know about you but it can completely ruin your dinning experience. I mean nothing ruins my mood easier than a poor meal when I'm expecting something much better. How I respond depends on my mood and on the circumstances. I didn't appreciate the waitress not returning to our table for such a long time because this whole experience could have been avoided. . RETURN FACTOR 50-50....%.         ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH"}
{"text":"Bad service. What more can I say? Our server was already named by someone else who gave a review of the bad service. No etiquette, inattentive. Not a surprise as I figured I would thumb past a bad review on yelp, about this server. I'm one out of possibly many who won't return due to the service. Quality control is needed. Especially when you're sat next to a table full of dirty dishes and food piled high from beginning to end of our visit. Refills came in new mugs, dropped it down on dirty napkins and then rushed off, though no pre-buss, so, empty mugs stared at us throughout the entire meal. I could go on, but then I'd just be a venting sour puss taking things personally when I really could care less. Just wanting to leave some advice: up your standards and work on your servers. Quality in service, food and cleanliness should all be equally important. Well, you would think."}
{"text":"Predictable, but with much worse service than I'm used to from a Chili's. Not that I have high expectations, but this guy was a wreck.   The food, however, is good bar food. They do their buffalo sauce perfectly and I tried their sweet potato fries with parmesan this time - not bad. There wasn't anything spectacular about them, but they weren't terrible. I'm a huge fan of most of their appetizers.  I had a buffalo chicken salad and my friend had a salad, but instead of chicken, substituted steak. He asked for rare, but you could not have cooked that meat anymore. I don't go to Chili's for steak, but someone has to see the difference between rare and well done. No?  Again, service was bad. Not horrendous, but had I not had good company I would have been irritated. Not sure what the breakdown was, but there was one.  Anyway, if you want predictable Chili's food, well, here ya' go!"}
{"text":"First let me say we have gone to this location many times & service has NEVER been stellar, nor have I ever written a review after the poor service, but this is the first time I feel compelled to write one. Yesterday I  decided to go for lunch. I invited my son. I hadn't heard from him & I figured he'd be at work. So I decided to grab a chicken bowl to go. I asked for dressings on the side. It took 20 min. @ the failed to put dressings on side. I waited another 20 min. For it to be remade. During that time my son texted & said he could meet later. I went home, returned later w him for dinner. The restaurant had a few people in the bar & NOT ONE PARTY in the dining rm. where we wished to sit. There was no one to greet or seat is for 15 min. My son advised the Bartender & she seemed a little agitated that she had to assist us & finally seat us. Finally about 10 min. later the server came. She apologized for her tardiness & also for the large \"atomic fireball\" she was chomping on. She took the order all along chomping on her candy. Very gross. Our drink Order showed up after our 1st course. The French fries were under cooked & limp probably from sitting under a heat lamp. My son ordered a chicken breast on his salad & they served him 5 pieces of chicken, not a breast. Then my order, 2 cheese enchiladas w all rice came w 3 not 2 enchiladas @ crunchy old rice! You do not even deserve 1 star, your service & food was horrible. You should have management oversee your kitchen & customer service. Your staff needs training. We will NOT return to this location anytime soon, if at all. When I got home I was unhappy w my experience & called the restaurant. The manager made no attempt to address the issues I presented, he merely made excuses. Your managers need training too."}
{"text":"I've been to the Champaign Chilis twice now and both times the service was slow. Last night I ordered the tripple dipper and chose the Big Mouth Bites (hamburger sliders), the Southwestern Eggrolls and the Hot Spinach & Artichoke Dip. While the two mini-burgers and the dip & chips was good, it was nothing spectacular. (My Aunt makes MUCH better spinach dip!) The Southwestern Eggrolls were the entire reason I ordered this combo plate and I was seriously disappointed when my plate arrived to discover how incredibly overcooked these were; there were black edges where it looked like they had caught fire in the microwave and the flames put out! They were also dry like they had been partially cooked, frozen and reheated....Ick.  If you like the \"Friday's/Applebees/Cheddars/Bennigan's\" standard American Fare, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Horrible. We ordered the grass fed sunrise burger medium rare. We were then told it only comes well done and was that ok?  Well of course it isn't. So we asked to get the same burger with non grass fed meat. They agree but bring us only a cheeseburger. No bacon and no egg. We sit take a couple bites and sit and wait and wait for someone to notice us. Finally a server comes over and we explain the situation. Obviously one would expect a new burger made properly. No. She goes to check on what can be done. Meanwhile the burger now sits stone cold. It's been about 15 minutes and we are then brought over separately on a plate a runny egg and soggy half cooked bacon to put on our disgusting cold burger. Neither one of us had been to chilis in a while and we unanimously decided we would not be returning. Hands down worst service from the kitchen and wait staff along w management who said we couldn't get the burger how we wanted. It wasn't overly busy. In a situation such as that mgmt should have come out to explain. On top of it I've barely made it out the door and the four bites are sitting in my gut like a brick.   Cheers to Mike the bartender who comped it without our asking. He gave us good service."}
{"text":"Short & Sweet Review:  It's Chili's people.  You get what you pay for at a cheap chain restaurant.  The following are the only two things that I order:  Bottomless Chips & Salsa for $2.99!  Seriously, I love this salsa!  Its not chunky and has heat.  The chips are hot and delicious!  Cajun Chicken Pasta- Penne pasta with creamy garlic Alfredo sauce with Cajun spices and topped with tomatoes and green onions. - I get a to-go box and have enough for lunch the next day.   The call-ahead option is great and they make sure to pack everything up nice & tight!  $20 for an appetizer & two entrees.  Perfect for a cheap date night! :)"}
{"text":"I am not one for chain restaurants....but had a gift card. Chili's is very noisy, and what's up with TV screens???  Stay home if you want to watch sports. The hamburger was good and cooked exactly how I wanted it, but the fires were not so good. Seems like they were under the heat lamp for several hours. The service was good. Now they use a kiosk to have you pay. Of course the one at our table didn't work.  I won't return unless I am forced with a gift card."}
{"text":"The most awful service of any Chilis on the planet, I ordered a simple salad, stood there for 15 minutes, no salad, no one cared, I asked for refund so I could make my flight.  On the flight in First Class to go pick up my Embraer Phenom 300 jet that was in service center, they had zero food, not even peanuts or pretzels, geez wonder why US Air will go bankrupt just like American Airlines recently did??  Wayne Gorsek"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. Late night drinks & apps. So its Tuesday and apparently happy hour all day. Food on happy hour from 9 to 10. Ok that works tonight. Bartender Ash was super nice amd we had some yummy apps. Texas fries,  half order of boneless chicken and southwestern egg rolls.  Two vodks and 1 beer. .out the door for under 25 bucks. I cant complain:)"}
{"text":"We went there yesterday  (a weds) at 630pm and it was not very busy, which we felt pretty good about since that would mean faster service right? A couple people came in before us and got seated as fast as the host can seat them. Our turn comes, we get a table right next to the door. The issue i have and why this place is getting 2 stars, is because it took us 15 minutes before deciding to leave. We were sat down and never acknowledged anytime after that. 3 different servers walked by us and not 1 said anything. No, 'have you been helped, your waiter will be here shortly' etc nothing. 2 of them were in the very end of our section whiping down tables and talking . Were they one of our servers? They walked past us twice, but like i said , nothing. Needless to say we ended up walking out and going straight to applebees which were 1000x friendlier and more attentive. I wont be back to this chilis."}
{"text":"It seems as if every time I come here, the food and the service keeps declining. This used to be a go to spot for a family meal. I don't think I will be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Today I had the best service at chilies restaurant in Chandler, Arizona. I just had to share my experience.. Gina was our waitress for the night. She was so on point from the moment we sat down until we left the restaurant. I loved how she anticipated our needs, such as; our waters being refilled & bringing out our straws without us having to ask. She checked on us after our meals arrived to make sure everything was ok. She never forgot a thing including our food that needed to be cooked to our specifications (I have severe food allergies). Gina was smiling the whole time as she waited on tables. A waitress like Gina is an asset to a business like this. I will definitely request her when I return to Chilis."}
{"text":"Terrible service / kitchen continues to be slow and makes mistakes / management is indifferent to having a poor experience"}
{"text":"We like this location and eat here often. Servers are always great. The new tableside guacamole is fab!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the bowls are awesome!  Service was great. Highly recommended, I don't know why we ever stop going to chillis!  But were back!"}
{"text":"Not even worth a star...the restaurants and staff at both the Chili's and Eat N' Park seemed too busy to take care of the customers...and especially the ones with two kids! Food took over 45 minutes for a salad and appetizer! Ridiculous! I will be up at the Mills location next time for sure!"}
{"text":"I hate giving this place only three stars but because of the management and the poor decisions that they make that's all they deserve.   OK, this location has all their employees wearing NFL and Collage Football jerseys and they advertise an incredible happy hour  for Thursday, Sunday and Monday night football. But then when you get there they only have one game on. Come to find out they don't gave the cable tv needed to watch more then the one game. One of the girls told us to go next door where they have every game on and something like 100 TV's. Very disappointing!   Then I find out that this location does not offer 1000 Island dressing when just the other day I ordered a burger with the 1000 Island.  So I ordered a side of the Shiner Bock sauce and the guy brings me BBQ and I poor in on my burger. Then when I tell the guy it's the wrong sauce he tells me that they don't have the Shiner Bock sauce anymore. Keep in mind I ordered my burger plane with a side of 1000 and now I have a BBQ sauce that I did not want.   Nope they did not offer me a new burger.   By the way, I went to another chilies a few days later and ordered the sane burger with the 1000 island and my buddy got the Shiner Boch Burger."}
{"text":"To everyone bitching about the food, I have to say, it's a chili's. I don't expect top of the line super duper tex mex. But I have been here two times and the service and food have always been good or what I expect. It's a little pricey for what you get but not a rip off. My fajitas where good. I got the trio and it was loaded with all three meats. My girlfriend had the chicken bacon avocado sandwich. She really enjoyed it. My only complaint would be not enough tortillas."}
{"text":"Freshly remodeled and the place looks great! Consistently good food and service in a VERY lively (sometimes noisy) joint.  This Chili's is huge. Sit in the bar for the best service, also there's tons of TVs in there! Presidente Margaritas = yum!"}
{"text":"I am calling  the health department  on your dirty butts. You served my granddaughter bad broccoli  which had her stuck on the toilet. The fact that you insulted my intelligence  with your cock- a-nanny-story about steaming  broccoli  will cause black discoloration on the stem. Sir I don't know where you took your classes at in nutrition  or cooking classes which I don't  believe  you had any form of training or education. You would  think you wouldn't  try to run some other lame tired excuse of dirty silverware spoiled broccoli, but you did when you came with this crock of shit ass excuse as to why my steak was uncooked  as I ordered.  It seems to me that you blamed me and even went as far as to say I didn't  know how to communicate or I didn't  know what I meant well done verses..gtfoh..... with that nonsense  for the sake of kids were present  you look I didn't  cuss your dirty nasty ass flying dandruff missing  tooth greasy hair and looking  like water skipped you ass out. I hope that you don't think your slimy dirty ass is getting  away. I am calling  the health department, dirty dining,  and whomever  will listen to me about your nasty establishment. You served  her bad food but didn't  comp the meal, you comped the soup because  you didn't  have clean utensils so that I  could eat the soup. My granddaughter  better not have to go to the ER neither  from your expired broccoli, and you have the audicity to talk to us as if we were stupid  or didn't  know any difference your crystal meth told your but wrong tonight. So sad Chili's  I thought  of you better  than that but I am going to have to throw you in the trash because  your establishment  basically  treated me as garbage serving spoiled food, dirty utensils. Your disgusting shame on you...."}
{"text":"The ever changing menu ensures if I ever do find something edible it will be gone in a few months. Great staff but the food is poor. Stick to the appetizer menu if you must eat here, chicken and waffles is ok. This is where chain restaurants go to die."}
{"text":"I would understand waiting for my food to be hot but unfortunately it was not hot at all.  I'd rather wait for quality over servicing a mass amount with no execution.  There needs to be a reevaluation of time management and how orders are processed."}
{"text":"We love sitting in the bar at the Chilis in Peoria. The wait staff is phenomenal, the food is great, the prices are great especially at happy hour.  We love Chilis!"}
{"text":"It was just one of those Monday's when I was too tired to cook, oh who am I kidding that's about every Monday, and any day that ends in Y! So instead of heating and eating at home we stopped by one of family favorites. Service was great, Tyler was fast and friendly and the food was great as always! My son had a Southern Smokehouse Bacon Burger, loaded with bacon and onion strings, sampled a few they were full of flavor! I had the triple dippler which was plenty of food to share, with two kinds of chicken, spinach and atichoke dip and a ton of chips!  We even shared the lava cake, it was a perfect way to end a long Monday!"}
{"text":"Wow I'm so disappointed. Chilis is one of my favorite places to eat but this time something was so off. The fajitas I got weren't nearly as good as they've been in the past. The chicken pasta I got for my toddler son looked raw maybe, but like another poster had written maybe was pre cooked and frozen then heated up? It was rubber and almost crunchy. Same with my fajitas and my husband's chicken. When I found the moldy cheese that was the end of my meal. $50 in the garbage. I won't be ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"We like the variety and taste of dishes at Chilis. The only downside is their cleanliness, most of the time I feel disgusted looking at how they don't cleanup the dining area (its a mess on the floor and also the way they handle food."}
{"text":"Had to drop this by 2.  The last time I was here service and food where excellent.  This time the food was very good but the service was lacking.    The server did not seem to care.  The sever took a long time to bring the drinks and it was not that busy.  Did notice that the sever took a long time to come to the table next to us to take their order.  They also have this device on the table that allows customers to play games for a fee.  Try telling the children at the table that can't have that.  Way to go to get more money out of the patrons.  The device also allows the check to be paid at the table so this makes the sever interaction less personable.. They also recommend on the device to leave a 20% tip and you need to adjust the amount or put zero if you are leaving the tip on table which I like to do.  If the service warrants 20% I will decide, it should not be suggested or added to the total first.  I did ask if the Chilli rice was spicy or not and the sever paused and was not sure if it was or not.  It turned out to be mild.  Not sure If I will go back.  That is too bad."}
{"text":"Late craving for the family on New Year's Day. I understand how short staff it can b but short of food?   The waitress was so loud, everyone knew what was happening in our table. there was a complementary item in our check, she not only made sure we knew but everyone around us knew too.   Although this place is a casual dinning, a little privacy and discretion goes a long way.   Waitresses out there ... Your tip does not depend on the total check. Your performance also is taken into consideration."}
{"text":"Order was incorrect, took 45 minutes to replace, replacement was incorrect, when we asked if they could do Something they took off five dollars from a 30 dollar bill. Not exactly correcting the problem."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I had the bacon burger and it was one of the most delicious burgers I have had in so long. Chipotle sauce, pickles, bacon, cheddar cheese on a burger! My mother and I also shared an appetizer (guac with chips) and it was really good-hit the spot! We split the 2 for $20 deal (1 appetizer, 2 entrees) and she absolutely loved her meal too. Great food for the price!   The only downfall to my visit was our server didn't seem to know the menu. She was such a sweet girl but when I asked what was on the burger she didn't know.... Other than that everything was excellent and we will be back!!"}
{"text":"I had a very great steak on the 2 for $20 menu. My long island iced tea was made perfect"}
{"text":"I'm back, everybody! i haven't written a review in awhile. i was on Saturn and couldn't get a flight back due to foggy rings.   i figured Chili's was a dive - and i was right, at least this store was. AS USUAL, this was another restaurant which served my seafood without enough tartar sauce, just a little cup, so i told our (i went with my boyfriend - yes, we're STILL together... i must really love him) waitress \"This is not enough sauce at all.\" this genuis replies, \"Well, for some people, it is.\" --- whatever happened to: THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT!?   anyway, i won't be going back to these dumbbells for food. and i left the waitress 2 dollars in quarters for a tip. see, that's what happens when you say STUPID things. i like to tip well, i don't like to stiiff people, but i'm not gonna give it away, either.  Chili's? NO THANX. see you guys at Denny's."}
{"text":"Never been to chilis before but today that changed.  First impression was not good, as near our booth was discussing.  The divider has so much dust on top of it, it looked like it hasn't cleaned in weeks! Also the kitchen was a mess as well.  I was surprised customers could see right through the kitchen.  You would think the workers in there would clean up better knowing anyone could look inside there...   We got our food relatively fast but half of it was cold like the ribs, sausage, and corn. Even the garlic toast was cold.  The flavor of the food was okay.  Nothing spectacular.    The only reason I'm giving it a 2 star rating is because our server Cyndi was so nice.  If she wasn't our server then it would've been a 1 star."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I decided to grab dinner here the other night before a movie. We walked in and went straight to the booths located in the bar area. The waitress took over ten minutes to greet our table & from then on our experience only got worst. Food was average... It's Chilis. We decided to finish our 'not so good' experience with a quick dessert and cashed out on the machine. Over 25 minutes later and no waitress near, we decided to leave without eating the dessert although we already paid for it. As we were walking out she finally came out with it... As we were out the door.  The highlight of our dinner was the Life game on the machine... Enough said."}

{"text":"Ordered online and ended up having to wait 12 minutes to get my order. The site said it would be ready at 2:17pm and I didn't get there till 2:25. Took about 5 minutes to get acknowledged. I actually had to let one of the girl's know I was there to pick up an online order. Even then all she said was, \"just wait by the bar, she'll be right out.\"   Then the girl who ended up helping me told me she didn't even see my order- AWESOME! Just what you wanna hear.  She found my order, the order was correct (Fascinating!).  No utensils nor napkins included to eat my soup and salad."}
{"text":"It's an old stand by. They do have a pretty good burger. Not too crazy about their appetizers especially the queso with beef. Where was the beef? Service is usually good. Prices are moderate. Overall nothing to rave about, but nothing really wrong with it."}
{"text":"We live across the street from this chili's, and  order takeout at least once a week from here. The online ordering is seamless and so easy. The food is consistently good, and the Togo staff is AWESOME!!- I have never had a bad experience and it's due to their attention to detail and perfect customer service. They go through my order with me, then go above and beyond to make sure I'm taken care of. I also have used the curbside pickup a few times which is so nice."}
{"text":"The level of service we received today was truly outstanding...  We arrived around 2:30 for a late lunch, were seated quickly, and then switched booths, without our server Felicia batting an eye.  We ordered without a problem and the timing from app to entrée was perfect.    I ordered my burger \"pink,\" but it was much less than medium when served.  As Felicia kept checking on us, I showed her the burger and asked it be returned to the kitchen for a bit more firing.  Away it went and despite the music and conversation of a few other patrons, I could hear the conversation in the kitchen.  Clearly, my less than perfect burger caught everyone off-guard!  While they were definitely upset, to me it wasn't a big deal. I always \"roll\" with burgers at Chili's - always without incident.  Once re-fired, my burger was served by the manager who waited for my approval.  Yep, perfect!  Many thanks to Felicia who took great care of us today, and also to the manager who ensured my satisfaction!"}
{"text":"Talk about a great employee! Amy was taking care of me at the bar today. I asked about their margaritas and when I said I wasnt fond of sweet & sour she offered to make me a fresh one from scratch. It was delicous! The thing that impressed me most is the level of customer service even though she appeared to be taking care of not only the bar but multiple booths and tables surrounding it! Feom the bar I noticed her thouroughly explaining the menu and offwrinf suggestions. The girl can move!  I heard a couple tables say goodbye to her by name, assuming theyre regulars of hers. Dedinite kudos to Amy, best service Ive gotten since Ive been visiting!"}
{"text":"This place has great food, but can sometimes have awful service! Last night my husband never got his soup nor did I get my salad. The waiter was so kind he got the manager to \"comp\" the soup & salad. Dah...what was there to comp when we didn't get it?!?!?!  Should have offered to comp our drinks or something we actually received. We enjoy going here because we like their food, but all too often they seem understaffed."}
{"text":"How do I start. My husband, my children, and I eat at this restaurant at least twice a week and we have NEVER had an issue here... actually the opposite. We have always had great service and the two Mae managers are amazing! Today we had the most terrible service we had ever experienced there. The waitress named chelsey was very unengaged and seemed like she had an attitude at the beginning. We felt very pressured when Ordering our food. For example I worded the bacon burger and she didn't even let me finish ordering what I didn't want in the burger and she didn't ask if I wanted it pink or no pink. Then she jumped to my husband asking him what he wanted before I could finish ordering. I got the loaded potato soup and I got it very cold and my husband ordered the chili soup and when we got it it didn't look like chili soup... looked more like sloppy joe meat in a bowl. The girl didn't even explain that the Chili soup wasn't the same as the one they used to serve a few days ago. My burger came out almost burnt with no onions in it when I ordered was no bacon or pickles. My husband ordered the same and his burger came out literally uncooked with a lot of blood on it (I took a picture of it). The managers were very understanding and helpful and she avoided us the whole time and didn't ask how we were doing or if we needed refills.   Like I said before I NEVER had an issue here ever! I love this place but this waitress was terrible! And when ever we asked for ranch or anything she had an attitude about it and when brought to us it's like she just threw it on be table and walked away as fast as she could......"}
{"text":"This chilis was actually one of the nicer ones that I've been to. The service was great and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"I was well attended. Their employee named RENE wqs awesome. He took good care of me and he is the best.   Keep it up Rene!"}
{"text":"I had the buffalo wings for lunch at the bar. Service was great, very friendly. Wings were so gross. Not sure how they cooked them or what sauce was on them but they were disgusting. That's the last time I'll eat at Chili's. Gag me!  I'd rather be hungry."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Friday night around 9. Surprisingly it was not busy. We were seated at the bar section in a booth. We ordered the 2 for $20.  App=Texas cheese fries  Entree 1-chicken pasta  Entree 2- honey Chipotle chicken crispers  Texas cheese fries are ok. French fries with melted cheese and bacon. How could you really go wrong with that? I like the house made Ranch that accompanies them. The chicken pasta was warm, almost cold. The chicken crispers didn't taste very good. I always love getting the chx crispers because the honey Chipotle sauce is good and its different. On this visit, I wasn't impressed. Service was fine. Nothing special. I probably wouldn't come back to this location."}
{"text":"I can always rely on this place! This particular store is conveniently located about 5 minutes from my house, and I've revisited plenty of times. The hostesses and waitresses have always been friendly, and service has always been excellent! The food is always great as well...probably the most consistent place that I've been to. I'd have to say Chili's and In-N-Out Burger are my favorite places to eat off of the Strip on a regular basis. I don't remember a single time that I've been disappointed in my dining experience.  My most recent visit on 7/17 during lunch hour was top notch everything! My waitress Ruby was awesome and had a sweet and approachable personality. She kept the refills coming, and checked frequently to see if everything was ok. There was even another waitress that checked once on my table as well.   I loved everything on the menu so far. Maybe I just click with a certain type of food style, and this is it. Previously I've tried the Southwestern Eggrolls, Texas Cheese Fries, Tostada Chips, Fajitas, Ribs, Fries, and Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie. I may even be missing some items throughout all the times I've visited. All so delicious. And I can't forget about the Blackberry Iced Tea. One of my favorite drinks ever. Just sweet enough. So refreshing!   It's hard to believe that as someone who loves burgers, I haven't tried one here until this visit. I recently went on a Strip \"burger tour,\" looking for the best burger in Vegas. I tried a handful of different burgers, all good, but never found one that justified the price. But after all this time, something I was looking for was right in front of me. The Chili's Classic Bacon Burger. For under $9 with your choice of side (lots of options available, including light broccoli and fries). The bun is soft, the patty was prepared to perfection, the bacon was delicious, even the pickles were tasty and not too salty. A perfect burger. It's still breakfast time and I want another one right now!  I think this is the best neighborhood restaurant by far. If I had to choose one place to eat at everyday, this would be it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent Chili's a lot.  The price is great for a sit-down restaurant with good food.  This was our first time to this location, though.  I wasn't impressed.  It felt more like a Denny's than a Chili's.  Makes for a less than desirable date location.    We always get the chips and salsa as appetizers.  Fun appetizer for eating and chatting.  I love the steak fajitas.  Can't go wrong.    I recommend Chili's wholeheartedly, but if you're going to go to Chili's, skip this one.  Drive another couple miles to the one on Power."}
{"text":"I give this chilis a no star rating. Only because my girlfriend ate the chicken dish there and not even 5 hours later she has FOOD POISONING!!! To the point where we are in the hospital room at 3:30 am until 7am.   Obviously the people working there don't give a fuck and they don't care if people get sick because I mean they still get their pay check regardless right? Yeah I KNOW IM RIGHT!   I refuse to ever eat anything from this COMPANY again!   TIP To Chilis: HIRE COOKS AND MANAGERS WHO GIVE A FUCK AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OK TO SERVE. WHO KNOWS THAY CHICKEN COULD HAVE BEEN 4 WEEKS OLD BUT IDK BC IM NOT IN THE KITCHEN INSTEAD IM IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM WITH MY SICK GIRLFRIEND"}
{"text":"had the crispy chicken tacos table side guacamole with chips. awesome food and service"}
{"text":"good food, prices, seevice, atmosphere. little advice chilis - im at the bar i ask for water. i drink it all of a sudden i drink a seed and notice the bartender just gave me a lemon with out me asking for it and now i have to worry about a lemon tree growing in my stomach."}
{"text":"Typical chili's in terms of food. Chili's is consistent with the presentation and taste of food every single time. My wife and I have eaten at thus location a handful of times. The only thing I feel this location could improve on is the serving staff, and to make sure the machines at each table are operable. A few times we have been here, it was slightly busy and the service was just average. We've been to this location when it wasn't busy at all, and the service was just average. This review is based on visiting this location for a period spanning one year."}
{"text":"Such terrible service! I would never come back again. Not only was the service bad but I felt like they were stingy on giving napkins, silverware and plates out. We got our appetizer with no plates or silverware and by the time we found someone to ask it was already cold and not good. My daughters straw went threw the cheap kids cup they provided and luckily the server seen and came right over to grab the cup but she never came back with napkins or a replacement drink even after asking. My husband and her sat there all wet as was the table. Once we got our food I still didn't have a fork. After waiting a good 10 minutes for her to bring me one my salad looked like soup and tasted terrible. At that point I was ready to leave and didn't want to be there another minute to complain. So we paid the bill and left very unhappy."}
{"text":"They were super nice here and the beans were salty but it was my first time at chili's and I liked it."}
{"text":"This place is a joke , we walked in Chili's and it never fails we went to set down to wait for a table to be cleared and because I am a disabled . So we sat down and no sooner we sat a mother couple came in and the hostess seated them so we got up and left.thank you Chili's I Will Never Be back."}
{"text":"I went into this particular Chili's on a Tuesday night. I am not a regular but have been there many times. Since I was dining alone, I took a seat at the bar. There were only 3 other patrons sitting at the bar and judging by their conversations, I'm thinking that they all worked at Chili's. The bartender (Alissa) was more interested in talking to her \"friends\" rather than seeing if I needed anything. Two of the three patrons were sitting together and were loud and boisterous. All I wanted was a quiet dinner. Won't go there again. Rude people"}
{"text":"Eat here with my family often.  The service here has dropped off!  Horrible servers!  Not a happy experience.  Felt like I was at McDonalds!  Server has no interest in making us feel like we were dining out.  Treated us like we were an inconvenience!  Not happy and hope management notices and fixes problem soon!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Chili's for years. Last July we came in and my husband and I ordered the fajitas. A few hours after I got home I felt awful. Bloated, constipated, etc   Terrible. The next morning it was coming out of both ends at the same time. (Btw I have chrons so my husband wasn't affected). 3 days later I'm in the ER still feeling awful. I recover. Last Monday night tried it again. (Haven't been back since July). Woke up the next day with the same symptoms!! Not as bad but are you trying to kill me Chili's?? I've missed days off from work because of you!!  NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service here. Waitress was very inattentive, and Todd the manager was very unwelcoming. Will never dine here for the remainder of my stay."}
{"text":"Chili's used to be one of our go-to spots. In the last year, we've been sad to see the service, quality and cleanliness take a major decline. We've ordered carry out a few times in the last several months, and each time there was an issue. If you need a cheap, quick meal it works, but definitely not what it used to be.  :("}
{"text":"We were seated right away, and she took our drink and appetizer orders immediately.  We ordered all you can eats chips and salsa, which were very tasty and fried pickles...the coating slips right off and way too greasy and sour!! My husband ordered the green chili enchilada,  he said it was really good.  I had chicken and steak fahitas, the chicken was very tasty and so was the steak... but I litterally could not chew the steak!!  Our waitress spoke to the manager and he came over and ended up giving me some more chicken to replace the steak... they give you very little toppings for your fahitas...about a rounded Tablespoon of each, sour cream, hot sauce, peco and guacamole and about a Tablespoon of shredded cheddar cheese...this is to have for the three soft tortilla shells you get.. Our waitress was very slow and took her sweet time coming back to our table to give us refills on our soda, then we waited about fifteen minutes after we were done for our check... there were only three other tables in the restaurant being used.... so they were not very busy."}
{"text":"We were greeted by the hostess and I asked if we could have a booth. She said \"Well, I really don't have any open.\" So we were seated at a table (no big deal). Upon looking around there were plenty of booths open in our area. It took a few minutes for our server to come to the table and take our drink order. The drinks arrived from the bar approximately 20 minutes later. Service was very slow and the restaurant was by no means busy. The food was very good like usual, except for the non-melted, chunky cheese that came with our pretzel appetizer. Drink refills took even longer than the first round."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING DISGUSTING DISGUSTING!! Bleh!  So gross! I ordered the buffalo wing salad, it was so gross! You know when you go to the store and buy lettuce, you avoid all the bags with all the soggy looking lettuce?!? Well... Chilis Too buys up all those bags and uses it to make their salads! My Salad was so gross, I was sitting picking at it trying to hunt for decent pieces of lettuce. Not to mention the dressing was gross too, pure mayonaise. Same goes for the wings, just plain gross! I ate like two pieces, after peeling off the sauce it was cooked in. To make things worse, it took way long to get seated, order, get our food, and when we were done to get our check. PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE... Don't forget you're in an AIRPORT, and people have flights to catch! Bleh. Just thinking of the food I got is making me feel nasty. My friend thought I was being cranky, and complaining too much while we were eating. Maybe I was/am. Maybe after all the good food on the strip, the airport was a reminder for all the nasty food out there.  1 star for the fries. Was the only thing that I ate without cringing.  PS, whats with the \"outdoor\" seating?! Great view of people going through security and enjoying the beautiful outdoors ;)"}
{"text":"Chili's food has been very consistent. Love the crunch and the flavor of the boneless honey chipotle wings. Big mouth burger was good. Server helpful and personable."}
{"text":"Those fajitas for $10.99 are such a deal. Split the chicken and steak combo and didn't finish everything. And they taste great  Of course we had to save room for molten lava cake. That tasted great too but wasn't  quite molten. Should have been heated longer because the was some chocolate in the middle that didn't liquify."}
{"text":"This is my first visit. To be true, I didn't go with much expectation. This was the closest place to where we were and the weather wasn't as good to explore.   We ordered tortilla Chips with salsa and guacamole to begin with. That was actually a good one. They gave us fresh chips and the salsa which was pretty mild and the guacamole was well made as well.   I ordered a mango chille tilapia which was too much on the sweet side. The topping was mango salsa with avocado (which was turning almost black). We also ordered a half rack ribs and a side of steamed broccoli (which was over steamed and mushy). The ribs were average- not out of the ordinary.   Our server was very attentive and often came by the table to ask how we were doing. I am giving an extra star just for him.   Food wise.. I won't come back again. I think they are much better places in Madison to try the same kinda food they serve."}
{"text":"Not impressed, ultimate burger was so so, fries were dried out, like the life was sucked out of them. Friends corn was over cooked and tasteless. Go across the street to Fuddruckers, much better!"}
{"text":"No Wi Fi are we still in the Dark Ages or what? Buyer beware on email from Chilies advertising bonus points for free meal, you have to be a bonehead to believe them, points are just worth three dollars. We had fajita for three, could really be eaten by one, 1/2 the size of menu picture on smaller serving skillet. I'm surprised this place doesn't go out of business, I know I won't return!!!"}
{"text":"It is just bad. What happened? I order fajitas and the green peppers and onions were raw. It was like they threw them on the sizzling plate right before bringing it to the table. The manager offered to have the cook redo my veggies. Huh? So I guess I was supposed to sit at the table and pick out the raw ones along with the few that were wilted. Since I had barely touched it, I would've just preferred my whole entree cooked the right way together. After all, I go out to eat when I want the convenience of not having to cook/clean up. If I need to dissect my meal to fix it, kinda pointless to go out.   The 2 stars are only for the waitress because she wasn't the one to blame for my food and happened to be very friendly."}
{"text":"I think this is the second time I've ever been to a Chili's...actually I'm not even sure if it's the second....it could be the first time I've been to a Chili - I think the other time it was Apple Bee's or something like that...anyways yeah well yesterday night my bf and his friend and I finally went to this place called JumpStreet - to jump our fat away  - but after that we got really hungry and it was around 9ish and after in Arizona closes pretty early but luckily Chili's closes at 10 so we were able to get a table and eat a fatty meal.  They had a $20 dollar for 2 meal deal - in which for two people you pick a appetizer and 2 entree from their list - super good deal! We decided for the Tostada Chips and Fire-Grilled Corn Guacamole for the appetizer - it's good, however I didn't like the chips because it was very thin and was a bit oily - the guacamole was good and had a hint of spiciness to it.   For the entree I had the Quesdilla Explosion Salad - interesting name and very tasty too except that I forgot to tell them to put the dressing on the side cause they put a little more dressing than I would like. The salad consisted of grilled chicken, cheese, tomato, corn-relish, cilantro, and tortilla strips tossed with a citrus-balsamic dressing and on the side four triangular cheese quesdilla! mMmm super delish! My bf ordered the margarita grilled chicken served with rice and black beans, tortilla strips and pico de gallo - doesn't look really good but it tastes okay.  Despite being a chain restaurant, the food is not bad and the prices are definitely a bit cheaper than other big chain American family restaurants."}
{"text":"Another place I wish I could give NO stars in order to review as everything was horrible. So, My wife, Ma, and I went here on 09/26/2015 between 6PM-7PM. First, we ordered and everything was okay. Until we got our drinks the margaritas were watered down and the strawberry lemonade tasted like there was more seeds from the strawberries than fruit. Then it took forever to get refills on our drinks, the fried pickles we got were full of grease, and the guacamole that came with the chips and salsa was brown and they tried to argue that it was fresh. Then when our food finally came after a very long wait my Ma's fajitas weren't even sizzling, the vegetables weren't cooked and the chicken and steak were barely lukewarm. My wife's ribs were okay but again lukewarm, she barely had a any rice on her plate, and then my steak I asked for medium rare and it was cooked great but then I go to eat it and there's cheese on it but nasty looking cheese. I peal it off and it comes off like it's skin. Was horrible. So, they make me another one which by the time it comes out I have finished my fries and 30 min has passed. This time it was well but I wasn't about to say anything I just ate it at least it didn't have \"skin\" cheese on it and was hot. We then ordered our dessert on the tables tablet thing and the waitress comes 15min after we ordered it asking if we were ready to order our dessert. We tell her we already have and she says that we weren't suppose to do that cause it messes up the check. Well, then she should have made it a point to come back instead of continuing to forget about us. And the whole time my wife and several other tables asked for the hockey game to be changed to one of the football games and it took them 50 min to finally get out there to change it as we were leaving. And as we were leaving the Manager is walking towards us and as he sees us he gives my Ma and I a dirty look and rushes the opposite direction. We will NEVER return to this one and will tell everyone we know how horrible it was. What makes it even worse is I wrote them through their website and still have not heard back from them."}
{"text":"One of the best Chili's we have ate at. Great service and nice staff. Thank you Kailey you were one of the best that we have had at any restaurant."}
{"text":"Went in there yesterday with my husband for his birthday, hostess seemed annoyed when we walked in . She could at least put a smile on her face when when greeting us. Food was okay, but our server forgot about our sauces making our food very dry to eat."}
{"text":"Slow service, long wait for food....wanted to try the all you can eat enchiladas.... The Ancho beef was pretty good, cheese not to bad, green chili chicken not bad, if the wait wasn't so bad I would of been much happier"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on a Friday night (crazy). The food was alright. Most of our meals were cold when we got the orders. I think because we were a big party, maybe some of word food was done before others and it was probably sitting out, maybe? The server was overwhelmed with the number of guest she was serving and I understood. I would have like to see better customer service skills. Such as, thank you for waiting, thank you for being patient and so on. When the food was brought out, that was a hot mess. There was a lot of confusion on who ordered what and then meals were coming out that we didn't order. It was just getting mixed up."}
{"text":"Typical chilis... Except this ones service is lacking... For some reason every time my family and I come it either takes forever for us to be greeted when we sit down or when we walk in we don't even get greeted at all. The good is alright nothing amazing but it Is for the most part good. We enjoy the all day happy hour on Sundays."}
{"text":"The food was great I think I found my new favorite dish the Mango-Chile Chicken. Great tasting and with a kick. The service is great helped us out a lot and always came to check on us."}
{"text":"We took my mom in for her first outing after surgery today.  The chips were very good.  That is the LAST NICE thing I have to say.  The salsa was acceptable.  The hostess was very unfriendly and seemed confused.  Really poor attitude. She put us in a spot where my mom could not get through with her walker.  Our food took over 40 minutes to arrive.  Two meals took an additional five minutes to come out.  My mom's steak was well done, ordered med. rare. They took the steak and then seem surprised when five minutes later I asked them to take the plate away and bring out fresh fries, bread and veg WITH THE STEAK when it was finished! The waiter was perplexed as to why she might like her whole meal at the same time.    I finally told them to forget the steak dinner. We were leaving.  The manager came over and was completely clueless about how poor his staff was performing and how crappy the food was. He could have cared less.   He thinks schmoozing is going to make us forget the crap show they just put on?  Puleeze!!  That server should be spending his time in his station instead of hiding out in the kitchen until he HAS to come out.  That is a surefire way to fail to see what you need to see.  My fajitas tasted like the sizzling skillet they were on.  There was no other flavor there.  The side of beans and rice was a complete joke.  It was flavorless as well.  The cheese that came with the order seemed fake.   Don't sell Mexican food if you are going to fail to put any authentic flavors in.  I guess it serves me right for not going to a Mexican restaurant and just stick to fried appetizers at a place like this.  Really, really disappointing.  I will not be back!!!  The quality is missing from the food.  The quality is missing from the service.  The quality is missing from the management."}
{"text":"I do really like the chain restaurant itself.  However, this locations experience was greatly disappointing.   Food was normal Chili's standard, but the issue was on the employees.  Our waiter was not talkative and shook his head yes or no instead of verbally pronouncing.   All of which could be played off as shy.   Greatest disturbance being the manager that goes around asking how everyone's meal was.  She was talking to another table as we were leaving and she was in the middle of the aisle.  My girlfriend Nicely said \"excuse me.\"  The manager turned her head and quickly looked back at the table and continued to talk.   My girlfriend was left to try and squeeze by her, as was I.  While I was passing, she decided to depart from her conversation and run into my shoulder.  I expressed my sympathy and apologized.   She never responded... Not a word.   We left with a sour taste in our mouth"}
{"text":"We have never been to any Chilis location before, although we pass by this one every weekend when we go to the movies.  On a whim we stopped in for dinner last night.  I am SO glad that we did!!!  The service was absolutely outstanding, the people were genuinely happy, and you can tell that they love what they do.  We ordered Blueberry Pineapple Margaritas and they were delicious!!!  The chips and salsa were abundant and better than some others that we have had.  Our meal was scrumptious and we went home happy!!  Thank you so much for a wonderful experience.  We will be back soon.  :)"}
{"text":"I only came here because I had a $20 gift card.  I usually avoid chains as much as possible.    We ordered the $20 dinner for two, were satisfied with everything, flavor, and portion size, but the true star was our server.   Holy cow, I haven't had that good of service in so long!  She was so fantastic!  Her name was Patrice.  She was detail attentive, made great recommendations, was super personable.  These 5 stars are for her."}
{"text":"It's Chili's! came Here for the lunch special with my boy and the GF! The waitress we had was awesome! Even let me take some soup home when I wasn't suppose to!!!"}
{"text":"Great service good food would highly recommend trying it out great for the kids too. You have to try there fried pickles they are to die for made in house very yummy"}
{"text":"Somehow they screwed this one up form the getgo No hostess to take out name down, when she did come around it was to seat a waiting party, strike 1 their table wasnt ready so she had to help clear it off, leaving me standing up front with a family confused and other people unable to navigate around us. Not that bad yet! Checked out their 2 for 20 menu, even with having low expectations about it my girlfriend and i skipped it and went for the main menu. I haven't been to a chili's in years and couldnt figure out the stupid ass menu. Honestly, very few pictures and some entrees had 0 description in one area, listed again on another page or in the little side menu planted on the tables. Given ample time I perhaps could have made an educated choice but our waitress was rushing/borderline harassing us. As soon as we sat down she asked if we were ready to order, BEFORE getting our drinks, really? Who does that... She came around 3 times in the next 5 minutes and asked \"Have you decided yet? -- Did you guys pick on something? -- Know what you want now?\"  Um. If customers have their noses planted in the menu and they arent looking up at all, NO THEYRE NOT READY  As a result I ordered a classic, cheese steak, cant screw that up right? Sigh... 0 taste for anything but the peppers, BARELY. I didnt notice the onions at all which is really sad, the cheese was gross :( and their fries are exactly the same as jack in the box regular fries.... wow ruined my whole day and i WONT be returning to ANY chilis again for years. I dont want to rant anymore, but chilis now ranks under applebees which has been going downhill too"}
{"text":"Came in Tuesday during lunch (4/11)  Had an awesome server but most of all one of the nicest, most accommodating managers I've ever dealt with. Especially for being a corporate operation. Way to go and thanks"}
{"text":"The wife and I can't get enough of this place!!! Always great food and a great experience overall!! Chilies is our go to date night food!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant  was moderately  busy  but we were seated  quickly.  We had the Mellon lemonade.  This was interesting  not too sweet  with lots of flavor . There is now a kiosk  to help with orders.. I had with chips with guacamole  . It was average.  The hot sauce  was more sour than hot. I also had their  ribs which were good .the sauce was not as sweet  as I would  have liked it . The fries were overcooked  . I ordered  the side order  of grilled  shrimp  . . They  were  so small.  Service was decent . They never  checked on drink refills"}
{"text":"I am a pharmaceutical rep and order Chilis catering all the time. Usually the various locations do a great job with being on time and having the order correct. I will spare too much detail here. I ordered from this location online last night for 6:15 pickup. Showed up on time and didn't leave for 20 minutes. This upset me because I had my dogs in the car as I was expecting to run in quick. My food sat out while the order was being put together. Watched her throw my tortillas in the microwave. Got home to food that was cold (it was sitting out for 20 minutes at the restaurant) and the tortillas were BEYOND stale.  I will admit, the to go area was busy, 4 of us were waiting for our food but the manager should have been called or at least offered to help. I will not order from this location again."}
{"text":"I ordered catering twice this week at this location. The first time, the food was about 10 minutes late (I had scheduled the pick up time).  The presentation of the food was acceptable on this occasion but I was a bit annoyed that it made me rush to my presentation I was about to give to medical staff. Yesterday, I ordered catering again ( same exact order as before). I was scheduled to pick up at 12:40. I called to let them know that I would be there at 12:45 and was told that they were getting my food ready. When I arrived, the food was not ready and nothing was bagged up. I finally got my order at 1:00 and was so late for my seminar (which was supposed to begin at 1:00). I ordered the burger bites and had to ask for the center ranch dressing. The server told me that the dressing did not usually come with it ( ummm yes, it does). Upon putting the food in the car, my coworker had to ask for a wet wipe because there was some sort of BBQ sauce all over her arm and shirt. I will go elsewhere for my catering orders. This location was messy, unorganized and unapologetic."}
{"text":"Service was very good. I ordered a salad with grilled chicken, and the chicken was not quite done, I brought this to the server's attention and they brought me new chicken right right away and apologized for the issue. My dad ordered the crispy cheeseburger and it was huge! The only issue what that they ran out of Bud Light bottles on a Saturday afternoon. The bartenders really need to work with their Hensley Sales rep to make sure the bar is stocked for a weekend."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Ordered our burgers medium rare and they were served medium well. I understand the need to cook meat through for food safety. But... If the meat quality is good this shouldn't be an issue. I don't like medium well, which is why I ordered medium rare. It is stated on the menu that the burgers are served medium well.  Don't ask how we want it done if that's not a option and you are going to serve it the way you want, irrelevant of how we order. Service was good although another issue is if you're paying by credit card, we were told to swipe the card at the order machine on the table. Our server was good, but isn't that his job?   With order machine at the table and paying ourself, the wait staff is less attentive and drinks were slow to be refilled or reordered, oh wait we do that ourselves on the machine in the table.  Customer service is lacking, maybe I'm old fashioned, by why are we tipping if we are doing the ordering and paying ourselves?"}
{"text":"I really don't have much to say about this one, but if you are going to the movie theater that is located in the same center, it is a good place to grab a drink or a bite. I take my niece on our \"girls day out\" movie trips here for lunch and she enjoys it.   I usually have a grilled chicken salad and she always has a pizza, so I can't really say that I have tried what they are famous for.. since I don't eat pork, but the atmosphere is always high energy and the servers are usually pretty good and fast."}
{"text":"Beengoing to this chili's for over 5 years  Love the servers  Food is always great  If we ask to have the game changed in the bar they are happy to do so!!'"}
{"text":"I hate leaving unfavorable reviews just as much as I hate bad dining experience. But I have no choice. Last night was the single worst dining experience I can ever remember having. Last night me and my guest arrived around 8:20 and was seated immediately. We ordered cocktails and when they were served we proceeded to order food at 8:30. I ordered a burger and fries, he ordered the sliders and chicken platter. We enjoyed our cocktails while we waited. At 8:45, no food. My cocktail finished. I ordered another assuming my meal will arrive very soon arrive. I notice it's now almost 9:00. Our waitress finally notice we're still waiting on our food. She tells us she's going to check on our food. It's now 9:06. Five minutes later she comes and tell us our food will be out very soon. At 9:16 our food arrived to our table minus my fries. She tells me she's waiting on freshly cooked fries. 5 minutes later different waitress obviously noticed the look on my face as I was done. Over it. She asks if everything ok, I say no. I said I've waited over 45 minutes for a hamburger and still the fries aren't ready. She went back and brought fries within a minute. Both our appetites were gone we were so disappointed. The manager came and apologized and took the meals off our bill, we were okay paying for our drinks. I took a few bites off one half of my burger realizing it was way over cooked. I ate about 4 fries. I couldn't eat even though I was starving when I arrived! MY BURGER WAS BURNED DRY AND CRUNCHY!!I just couldn't get over how unimportant as a customer I felt . The manager left my guest two $5 coupons and me two as well. I left my $10 worth of coupons on the table as they were of no value to me since I'm never ever eating at another Chili's in any location ever again as long as I live. That's how done I was with Chili's!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty good but my husband got the crispy firey chicken and it was so hot it made him I'll. He eats hot food all the time. He mentioned it to the server and asked what kind of pepper it was and she just laughed. There should be a warning when something is that hot. It could kill you."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming here! Whenever we visit we come to this chili's. The waiters are the best! I recommend going here :)"}
{"text":"Gate D has many food places too from (it is definitely the boughier, more well-kept gates of all the ones I've been to at the Mccarran Airport), and I made the right decision choosing this place. Their beer selection goes beyond the Stella/Bud Light selection, which was my selling point in coming here. I got the Goose Island IPA and enchiladas. The enchiladas came out piping hot with a little bit of spice to each bite. My server was very attentive and friendly. The beer took a little while to get out to me, but I think that was because she had to wait for someone else to pour it. I really enjoyed the music selection and its volume not being too loud or too soft. It makes for a good spot to sit and enjoy alone time or to chat with a friend."}
{"text":"Chili's is one of the restaurants that I will eat at that is a chain restaurant.  The reason why is because every time I eat here I know that food will be good.  We came here with my nephews and my niece a couple of weeks ago.    The service was awesome; they kept being soda for the kids and our food come out really quick.  We got a couple of the 2 for $20.00 deals.  The cheeseburger was better then I thought and the Mac & Cheese was good too."}
{"text":"I had ribs, had to send them back because they were cold (yuk) wife had a burger, worst  $10 burger ever. The place looks like it could use a good cleaning. We will not be back. $36.00 plus tip, we should have gone to in-out burger !"}
{"text":"Great service, my ribeye was more fat than meat yet the rest of the meal was very good."}
{"text":"$13.85 for a buffalo chicken salad wasn't a bad deal, and the amount of crispy chicken i got was quite generous.  got my order to go, did take a bit to wait for food, so time yourself accordingly if you're catching a flight.  there are tables right outside of the to-go area, so you can easily grab a seat there."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed they took the Spinach Artichoke dip off the menu.  It was one of the main reason we went to Chili's.  Very upset about it..."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Presentation of the food was great as well. Solid meal at a decent price."}
{"text":"We go here all the time. Service is great. Sometimes real busy and usually noisey but thats fine with us. We love coming here 4 our date nights and just recently my husband takes our daughter to daddy daughter night which is so nice. Love all their coupons for free queso or free dessert. The reg. Chocolate molten cake is so good sometimes we drive here just to order it to go."}
{"text":"Why did I bother? I'm not a fan of chains by any means but the ONE thing that chains do offer is consistency and decent service. Tonight I had a strange craving for a Margarita and something protein based like burger or steak. As I debated over where to go, I thought...I have no make up on and I just want food that I can count on and someone else to cook and serve. I figured, what the heck a Chili's would probably be exactly what the doctor ordered. Quick in...grab a Margarita, burger, relaxation, head home...  That isn't what I got  I walked in and sat down at the bar. The bartender somehow didn't see me walkin with the whole 6 other people sitting there. I sat down and waited and waited and waited...long enough that I got frustrated and started watching him only to see him watching the basketball game. Yeah that wasn't making the situation better. A good 5 minutes after I sat down he FINALLY noticed me and came over fumbling with menus. By the way, never apologizing for not seeing me there. He asks me what I want to drink and I ask for water while I look at the menu. This takes unbelievably long with him putsing around doing random tasks while I wait...  He finally comes back with some water when I order a Presidente Margarita and then very clearly order a burger rare, no bun, and sub broccoli for the fries. He seems like he heard it all and goes off to spend several minutes on the POS and mixing my drink. When the margarita arrives I figure things will now be ok and turn around. I mean really how much more can he do wrong?  I play on my phone for a few when the food arrives. I see the fries and ask the girl who brought them if she could get me broccoli instead. At  this VERY SECOND she and bartender disappear to the kitchen leaving me with my sad burger patty (seriously Chilis you charge people $9 for THAT little piece of burger?) getting colder and colder since he never bothered to bring me a knife and fork. As I sit there for a good 5 minutes wishing I had gotten at least a \"Oh I'm sorry. Let me fix that but here's a knife and fork so you can eat while I'm in the kitchen\" I start to get irritated AGAIN. At this point I'm just over it all. I came here for simple, easy and consistent. Instead I got irritation, ignored, and mediocre.  When he finally comes back with the broccoli and FINALLY offers me a knife and fork, I push back the plate, offer to pay for my drink, and tell him this was NOT what I wanted when I came out to eat...  Instead I came home and cooked which was EXACTLY what I did NOT want to do.  In the end I was so irritated by the whole situation that I can guarantee that I will NEVER walk into this location again and I have hesitations to ever go into any Chili's again. I just wanted someone to acknowledge that I sat down, get me some food, and know that a fork would be nice BEFORE the food was cold. In a city built on service, you would think I wouldn't have to want for that scenario."}
{"text":"Food was perfect, waitress was great, everything on time, food was perfect temperature, and their menu has a lot of new options"}
{"text":"Super Bowl Sunday...  Showed up at 5:00pm and the place is empty.   Ordered dinner for 5 adults and 1 child.  6:38 still waiting for food.    Really?  Steak was ordered medium and showed up rare.   Cup of soup was barely warm.....  This is not a well run location."}
{"text":"Been seated for over an hour and still haven't seen our food... server said it would just be another minute. Ugh. Explain that to the kids.  Restaurant is half full too."}
{"text":"Four stars for the chips and salsa alone.  What can I say, I'm easy to please in that regard.  Seriously though, that's generally the reason I go here.  Also it's right next to Ross Park Mall so it's a convenient stop after a long day of shopping.    Physically, they've renovated the place over the past year compared to how it used to be.  It's definitely an improvement in that area.  They've  got a dining area and a bar area.  Both sections have televisions where you can watch whatever popular sports game is going on if that's something that interests you.  Staff are generally nice and accommodating although sometimes they run a little slow.  If you go there enough, they might start to remember your order for you before the words even come out of your mouth.    Food-wise, it's what you would expect from this type of restaurant.  You get what you would expect.  Although I'm a bit unhappy with how they've currently been changing their menu around.  They're no longer making items with regular white bread which is surprisingly disappointing to this picky eater.  I'll pass on the wheat bread.  If you're having a \"TREAT YOURSELF\" type of day and aren't bothered with regretting the amount of calories you've put into your body in just one meal, then order the yummy molten chocolate cake for dessert.  It's so chocolatey and so delicious."}
{"text":"Go see Cameron! He is our favorite and we are always sure to wait for him if they are busy. He remembers exactly what we eat & drink and he even knows how we like our steaks cooked! I always get fajitas. They are super good. Chips and salsa are our go to appetizer. This location hasn't always been the best as far as service, so I'm super happy we found Cameron because we have literally NEVER had bad service with him as our server. Best time to go is during the weekdays in the evenings, but if you go on a Friday before 6 pm you're good! Fajitas are my favorite! I also like the margarita grilled chicken!"}
{"text":"The service is very slow. I thought it was a one time deal, but this place is consistently slow. The waiters just stand there relaxing  in the back while we were waiting for our drinks. The service is not good at all."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the atmospher of this Chili's location. My server was very monotone and really didnt even seem to care untill it came to the end when we needed checks. I told the hosts that we were there with some friends for a Birthday, she told us that she would let our server know. About 15 min afyer we staryed eating, I went to remind him. He told me, \"We can give her ice cream, but they could not sing becaise they got comolaint.\" WTF is that about. The Chili's on litchfield sing to there birthday guests all the time. He said they would bring ice cream, but that never happened either. I guess that another resturant on Bell I will not be going to."}
{"text":"Our family has eaten here so many times and loved the food. So, last night I had a craving for the fried cauliflower. Our waiter took our order. About ten minutes later he came out and said they were OUT of Cauliflower!! So after trying to figure out what I wanted I ordered again. Our daughter ordered a pasta dish. Fifteen minutes later, I kid you, not the manager came out and said they were out of PASTA!!!! We place another order which took another 20 minutes. My husbands chicken was terrible and the rest of the food was so so.   I thought the manager could at least comp us for an Ice Tea or something for the inconvience, nothing!!!  So disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The service was atrocious. We didn't see our waitress for nearly 10 minutes after we were seated. It was another 10 minutes before she brought us our drinks (water, is that so difficult?) and then about 30 minutes before our food came out. The food was good. We wanted to split our bill but couldn't do it on the electronic thing on the table because we didn't want 50/50 and that was the only option. There was also some weird 99 cent charge that she said she would take off. After waiting about 10 minutes, we gave up and split it 50/50 including the stupid 99 cent charge for no reason.   I will never, ever, ever be back. We were there nearly two hours which is completely ridiculous especially since we are both fast eaters. Terrible. Just terrible."}
{"text":"We came here on a Tuesday and sat at the bar. Our bartender was Nick. He did a great job in getting our drinks and food.. Overall happy with our experience."}
{"text":"Unfortunately  the computers were down and had  25-30 min wait behind several other parties. I guess they don't know how to work on paper anymore. And when I asked about it, she said 'no, they can't put orders through the computer and it would screw up the current orders'. What orders if the computers were down? Had to leave laughing at how much they depend on computers to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"It's your basic Chili's.  We came during happy hour and had some good food and cold beer."}
{"text":"I stopped for food here in Vegas while t the Airport and the place was packed and noisy. Food was good next time I'm down that way I will do the same."}
{"text":"Good food good service, a nice place in the neighborhood to have a cold blue moon and a burger."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I dined at this Chili's location five weeks ago for the very first time and then for the second time two weeks ago. Our first visit was one of the worst restaurant experience as we have ever encountered. My daughters grilled cheese came out 12 minutes after a food runner had dropped off my husband and eyes food. As you can imagine having a toddler who is who is hungry and confused as to where her meal is can be somewhat of an unpleasant experience. Aside from her food coming out 12 minutes after my husband and eyes my husband's food was incorrect. But unfortunately we never saw our server again so we were unable to rectify the issue. And sadly we both waited till my daughters food came out to eat so both of our entrées were cold. We gave that experience a benefit of doubt thinking they could've just had an off night, and this was just a random thing. So we went again three weeks after that visit and I have to say it was worse than the first. After we were seated it took over 10 minutes for us to be acknowledged at the table. Going on over 25 minutes from when we sat down one water and on beer were finally brought. When the beverages were placed at our table we were hoping to order our food since we were going on over at most a half hour of being there we already knew what we wanted. As the server place the drinks down she said she'd be right back well no joke more than 10 minutes went by still no server. My husband had to go up to the bar to get a refill on my water. He asked the bartender if we could place our order, bartender replied that she would be right over. Once we placed our order with our original server we know joke never saw her again. A food runner brought out our entrées which sadly were incorrect again. My chicken sandwich was cold, my daughters kids meal was missing her side, and my husbands fajitas were cooked more than well done and the runner failed to bring his toppings such as salsa, guacamole, cheese etc.. The runner came back a few minutes later with the missing items. But sadly mine was still cold.   After eating we waited around for our server to come so we could mention these issues to her and also get our check, but we literally never saw her again, the table behind us overheard us asking for our check and they mentioned that we could pay on this iPad looking thing. We were able to pay our tab, and left never once saw the server again. If the server would have come by once our meals were Broughton we would've had the opportunity to express our disappointment with her. But we were never given the opportunity at that restaurant.  My husband and I hardly ever go out to eat with her daughter so when we do we choose places that are kid friendly. But also that we know can have somewhat of a fast service. There's no reason for us to dine at a Chili's restaurant for almost 2 hours when we know already what we were going to order. We were so upset on the way home that the food was not great service was horrible and etc. that I decided to send an email to Chili's customer service the following day. It took almost 2 weeks to get a reply back from them, and when I did get a reply it was so generic, They did not address any of the specific issues, but said they were sending complementary gift card. Writing that email certainly had nothing to do with money or wanting a free meal. But we were just six so extremely disappointed on the second visit that someone needed to know. Like I said before we gave the first visit the benefit of the doubt and decided to go back a second time. Wish we extremely regret. We will be giving the gift card away because my husband and I know for sure we will never dinette that chilies location, or any other chilies locations ever again.   I do need to know that I'm both visits the restaurant was not busy. There were many many many empty tables so it's not like they were swamped."}
{"text":"Great staff,friendly,attentive and clean restaurant. I never come to chili's but decided to for the all day happy hour on sunday.you can't beat the prices and at least you can see some sunshine and not be tempted by any gaming. It was a fun Sunday drinking and eating their nachos and onion jalapeno strings.I'm coming back next Sunday:)"}
{"text":"so normally you don't have high expectations for Chili's . especially when you had no intentions of eating it in the first place.  walked in & was sat immediately, i mean i was like 2pm on a tuesday. anyway, we sit down. our server came over and introduced herself. she was very sweet. she took our orders and we waited. not long. i ordered a steak and it was actually reallyyy good. it was cooked how i asked and it was juicy . i would go back"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving only is giving this restaurant 2 stars because my food was hot a good. But he sides that my visit was a horrible experience. Let me elaborate the service was garbage. My waiter   Moved as if he had nothing to do. I asked for dressing for my salad never came back. Never was asked it I need more to drink. Never check on the table. And my friends drink was wrong"}
{"text":"Not even worth one start! It was horrible! We usually go to a different location but we figured since we were at the chandler mall we would just go there. First of all we didn't see our server till 10 minutes after being sat. I timed it. I wonder if their cooking staff was low and the servers were cooking the meals them selfs because the food took forever! We still didn't think much of it. And the place was half empty! Half way through our meal we ordered a chicken sandwich to go. And that took another 40 minutes (my husband times it) now a total of 2 hours and 20 minutes later with a 4 year old I just went to the car and left my husband waiting. Do not go here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ur better off at their location in gilbert."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever! The greeters at the door were fine, but the waitress we got stuck with left us with a bad taste in our mouth. Must've been low on staff because we got one of the rudest servers I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Don't come here in a good mood because you'll leave extremely irritated. Anything we tried to order, we'd get cut off and told we couldn't get that. I've never been told we couldn't order something because the WAITRESS didn't agree with it. \"Wait, your child wants BOTH entrees?\", ARE YOU WATCHING MY CHILDS DIET?, \"so you wanna pay extra?\" ARE U PAYING FOR MY FOOD?.. \"We don't allow adults to order off the children's menu\".. but if you don't serve grilled cheese to adults, why can't I order from the children's menu to get it?!?!? Or we'd get hit with side comments like, \"Wow, you must be really hungry\"... Yeah silly, that's why we came in here! Too bad I'm losing my appetite thanks to you.   Being that we came in on a holiday, we were pleasantly surprised that Chili's wasn't as busy as the neighboring restaurants (especially after being the third or fourth spot we tried to visit but found to be too crowded); but after experiencing the service & thanks to this Waitress with an Attitude, we can understand why people weren't lining up at the door.  Thanks for the experience Chili's, at least I know Customer Service is not a main concern for your establishment... I just wish my family and I didn't have to be the ones to find this out.  *Server name: Laurie"}
{"text":"So we hadn't been to chili's in a long time but decided we wanted to go out and do the dinners for 2 .  Stood there for 15 minutes at 8:45 at night before we were even seated.   But my husband doesn't eat meat and they wouldn't allow us to do shrimp fajitas . Strictly chicken. So he ended up only being able to get a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus as his meal and I did a steak . My meal alone was the price of the dinner for 2.  Ordered the kids meal so it would be out before our food was but the side of sour cream for her to dip it in took about 13 minutes to come out so her food was cold.  It was a horrible reunion for us and chili's and we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I love this Chili's and the service I receive here.  Presidente Margaritas are always solid."}
{"text":"Food is ALWAYS great! But this was the FIRST time in my life I left a 10% tip. I usually leave 20-40%. Service just complete sucked."}
{"text":"Hello,  We came in on Friday night at 6:30pm and wanted to sit at the bar area and asked if they could clean off one of the many dirty tables since he just cleaned off one if the tables for someone else. The host said he was told don't clean off the tables because they were too busy in the bar to take any more guests. So we were instructed to wait for a seat in the main dining area. I couldn't believe what i was told. So five tables sat dirty on a Friday night.   Jack"}
{"text":"I love Chili's normally but tonight they were really off their game. I don't usually go to this location either but we were in the area so we stopped it. We were seated right away. The waitress came and took our drink orders she was a little snippy. My daughter was making a statement and the waitress interrupted her and corrected her. By the way my daughter's 22. We ordered our food and waited. When our food did come it was cold. The overall Ambience of the restaurant was very loud and at some point when the waitress delivered the food, she said is there anything else besides more water I can get you. I didn't hear that and so I asked for more water and she looked at me and she said \"I said besides more water\". Sadly I won't be returning to this particular location. My husband ordered the fajitas and when they arrived they weren't even sizzling. Now that's just sad!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself looked like it was getting worn down, but the staff was friendly and efficient. I ordered takeout online and picked up at the restaurant.   I got the bbq meal with salads and fries and my husband and I split it. There was a lot of good food. The chicken was dry, but the rest was pretty good.   I drove from Henderson to Spring Valley and the fries were cold and the cheese on them was hard. That's not their fault. It was a 20 minute ride home. The sausage was the star of the show."}
{"text":"Had lunch with clients today at this location only to discover that the restaurant had no beef itrms... no burgers, steak fajitas, etc... I know, it's like going to a tire store and they don't have tires to sell. Not receiving an explanation or reason alarmed us on what may be the problem or what other items may have concerns.  Have visited this location in the past without issues, this seemed odd not to Yelp it."}
{"text":"This is a deserted place for a thurs night dinner time. The service was slow. We are not going back."}
{"text":"The bathroom toilet look like nobody had cleaned it in months! Horrible mold and growth ring around it! I choose to stay and eat because I always had positive experiences with Chili's. This time was different, the food made me sick that I swear I have a case of food poisoning! I was sick within 20 minutes of consuming my food, a meal that I normally eat from Chili's without looking at the menu. The waitress depends upon the people to use the kiosk rather than good old fashion customer service. I still left a 20% tip because I'm not cheap. However, I would never walk back into that dirty Chili's again, and not looking forward to any Chili's restaurants for any future plans either."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this location about a month.  Over the past 6 months the service has really gone down hill.  I had a really bad experience about 6 months ago with food taking way too long (20 minutes to appetizer, additional 30 minutes to food, and food was cold) and a manager who didn't care.    I took a couple of months off.  Tried again, still bad and slow service.    Took a couple more months off and gave it one final try.  Still really slow service and the food was mediocre.  I had to ask for Ice in my ice-tea.  I didn't want warm tea, I ordered ice tea.  My appetizer chips weren't warm and were a bit stale.    Ironically they now have these kiosks on the table where you can place orders and pay your bill.  I didn't want to use it to pay my bill but the server went MIA and was forced to use it.  Fortunately it had an instant feedback screen where I expressed my displeasure.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've been to this Chili's a few times, and it was fine for when I was with a big group that wanted to eat fairly cheaply.  This time, a friend & I needed a place to grab lunch to kill time during a car inspection and Chili's was nearby.  It was a pretty awful experience...The waiter was a very tall, very ditzy kid who gave such bad service I felt like he owed me a tip for putting up with him.  Not only was he super slow, but he bought us rancid spinach & artichoke dip.  It smelled awful, but we tried it anyway.  To quote my friend, \"It smelled the way it tasted--like feet.\"  Of course, our waiter was nowhere to be found, so we sent the dip back to the kitchen with the next server who walked by, and she was appalled by the smell alone and apologized profusely.  And when our waiter found out, he said, \"I'm sorry you didn't enjoy that dip.\"  Obviously."}
{"text":"PLEASE PUT UTENSILS IN THE TO GO ORDERS!!! This is the 3rd time I had take out from this location and didn't receive utensils in my package.   The food is great, the staff is friendly, and the service was excellent but...PUT UTENSILS IN THE TAKE OUT AND TAKE HOME PACKAGES!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped @ this location because we like the one in East Mesa & we're waiting for family to land @ Sky Harbor. It was an Hour before close so I'll grant them that but the service was so slow. They do have reverse happy Hour which is awesome but it took 40 mins to get 2 appetizers. The drinks were fairly priced and the wings are good but I'd stick to the Power Rd location where the service is better."}
{"text":"Love the wings @ it's a happy hour staple with a cold beer. Whenever we walk in we're greeted within a couple minutes & seated quickly."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with happy our drinks and appetizers? Upon entry we were greeted immediately & took our seats in the bar area. We opted for a couple beers, salad, & chicken wings which was more than enough to fill us up. Everything came out fast and the staff were friendly... a good little spot for a quick cocktail."}
{"text":"We had a great bartender and received excellent service today at all day happy hour. Margaritas, chips and guacamole, and sports on TV. Great atmosphere and customer service.  (We can't recall bartender's name, but he was from Missouri. )"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at the bar. Ivan made us top notch presidential margaritas and the chips and guacamole were fantastic. I'll definitely be back. For less than $30, we had dinner and drinks and great TVs to watch all the basketball games."}
{"text":"Our dining experience at this Chili's was something we will NEVER repeat!  The waitress was attentive enough, but had told us she would have a \"partner\" helping her out who never appeared...supposedly the manager delivered our food.  The food was simply awful!!  We had ordered the appetizer of onion strings with jalapenos...sounded good but was way way over the top salty!  We complained to the waitress and she simply said it was probably the batter...she hadn't had it in a while, but would let management know.  Apparently she never said a word because that \"server\" manager never came back to us.  My husband's steak which was covered with some kind of sauce was over the top salty also.  My Bacon and chicken quesadillas were meh.  Even the \"presidential\" margarita was no big deal.  Extremely disappointed and will never return to a Chili's again."}
{"text":"Stopped I'm here for lunch after leaving the outlets. We were sat right away and greeted within an appropriate amount of time.  Our sever was friendly and attentive.  We could tell she was slammed however, it seemed like she was the only sever we saw.  We could see she was running around from table to table, but we were good and she didn't lack in her service to us.   I had the southwestern egg rolls as my meal. Even though its an appetizer, it's definitely a generous amount to fill you up. I love them especially the ranch sauce dressing they serve with it, yum!!   When we went to pay we tried to use the kiosk on the table but the bill that came up wasn't ours. We tried to clear it out and pull it up again but it still wasn't ours. We saw a hostess walk by so we stopped her and asked her about it. Her response threw me back, \"I don't know, I can't help you with that, best thing to do is findnyour sever and ask her\". I'm sorry but What the Heck?! I looked at her and she looked at me like what else do I want...I said \"uh ok\" and she walked away.   Seriously, how rude! I mean even if you don't know, last I checked I was still the customer and as part of customer service the least you can do is help me figure it out or maybe you can get my server for me instead of telling me to \"find her\".  Needless to say that being my last interaction of my meal kinda put a sour note on it, hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Ok... Got talked into coming here from a '2 for $20' email offer I received, the steak looked great.  Got in & seated right away.  Handed menu's & nothing was mentioned of the '2 for $20'.  Had to find it on the 'Waitress replacer', that stupid digital game console they have at your table.  Asked waitress about it, she picked up the 'replacer' and read from there.  Wow, I could have done that!  Nothing mentioned about steak as a choice.  Thought we misread the email but it was too late as I had deleted it.  My wife ordered the Grilled Steak Fajitas, Add Shrimp, Add side or Rice & Beans, NO GREEN PEPPER.  I ordered the AUCE Enchiladas.  I also ordered Chips & Salsa.   The C&S arrive right away, the entrees arrive a half hour later.  A Half Hour?  Admitted- the restaurant was a little busy- but we were seated right at the kitchen door and there weren't orders flying out that door.  My Steak Enchiladas looked great.  My wife's Fajitas had green pepper on them!  I usually give the waitress / kitchen staff the benefit of the doubt on really special requests but asking that ONE ITEM be left off the plate and they screwed up.  We flagged down the waitress and when she was told about the peppers, the waitress simply said, 'Oh, I will have them re-fire another...'  It was clear that the waitress screwed up.  What was confusing was that she WAS WRITING DOWN OUR ORDER as we were giving it.  My wife 'opted out' of the 're-fire'.  She insisted I eat mine but that she wasn't going to have a new one made up because of the stories we've heard about how they treat 're-fires' at franchises.  She was happy to just let me enjoy my entrée.  The manager came by to apologize and to again offer a 're-fire' but we turned it down. When I was about half way through my enchiladas, the waitress came by to ask if I'd like to get another one started.  'Yes' I said, 'Chicken this time please...'.  I finished my first order and waited... and waited... and waited... So long that another waitress stopped by to ask if she could get us anything else, to which I replied 'I'm still waiting for my second order of Enchiladas'.  She went right over to the To-Go Register, did a quick search, typed something in and went back out through the kitchen.  At no time did our original waitress stop by to check on us.  We waited for another maybe 10 minutes and decided to cut our losses.  We paid through the 'Waitress Replacer', grabbed our coats and got up to leave.  As we were headed out our waitress appears and says, 'Oh, are you leaving?  My manager was on her way over...'  Really?  To tell us what?  That they can't get anything right?   It's a real shame too because we have been in a rut recently where we've gone to the same restaurant over & over and we thought we'd try something new(er), meaning going to Chili's.  I used to spend countless nights at other Chili's when I worked on the road, but never have I experienced as much disregard for the customer..."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner tonight! I had some special requests for my meal and they pulled through.  I ordered the rib eye medium rare, no potatoes, extra broccoli loaded style and avocado...it looked so good other customers were asking me what I ordered! Service (I think her name was christie?) and food A+++"}
{"text":"I just want to thank the manager and waitress that complimented on my family today and provided a complimentary desert for my kids. It was too sweet. They said it was refreshing for them to see a family who enjoyed each other's company and didn't engage in electronics. I appreciated the compliment all in itself. Great service, great people.  Mahalo from a Gilbert Family."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here.  They train their staff properly and the kitchen puts out some pretty decent meals.  Check out \"Fajita Mondays\".  Besides deals on the fajitas, they offer drink discounts, too."}
{"text":"It's not bad and it's not great. You know what you are getting before you get it. The fajitas are always my go to dish of choice.  I've never had rude staff or upselling here.  Good location, always seating available. The chocolate molten cake has a special place in my heart. This used to be the dessert of choice for my wife and me when we were dating. +1 star for that."}
{"text":"This visit to Chili's was just A-OK. I did have an excellent El Presidente Margarita - Strawberry. Yummy! However, I ordered their Chicken Honey Chipotle Crisper's, meh.   My wifey ordered their 3 Dipper platter, which she enjoyed. :)"}
{"text":"I've been to multiple Chili's before always with a pleasant experience.  You know what you're in for when you go.  Nothing extravagant, food doesn't blow you away, but for the price, its decent and its a good atmosphere.  Normally, no complaints.  This trip was different.  Our server was Jason and from the moment he walked by, I could tell he was going to be terrible.  His first interaction with us was him saying \"Drinks?\" while looking at his cell phone.  We told him and it took a good 15 minutes to get a coke and a strawberry lemonade (which was awful by the way).  He gave us our drinks and then walked off again.  He only had one other table he was serving, so I'm not sure why he was never around.  He came back and squatted down saying \"What are ya eating?\"  We gave our orders while he constantly looked at and made signs to one of the other servers down the way.  Took our menus and off he went.  Another server delivered the food, refilled drinks twice and then Jason showed up with the bill.  Needless to say, he didn't receive much of a tip.  I'll request not to have Jason if I decide to return again."}
{"text":"I have been to another Chili's in town. I haven't been here in a long time. I went here for thanksgiving eve dinner. We split the quesadilla explosion salad and honey chipotle chicken crispers. And they have great service and good food."}
{"text":"I like chillis, and I got good food and I chips and guacamole and I got the fresh mex bowl and I got water I am satisfied with the review of chillis."}
{"text":"This is our \"place to go\".... whenever we are in the mood for a dinner out this is our place to visit! We sit in the bar always because the staff is awesome. Kyle and David are amazing and so personable! The really do make our time there more enjoyable :) Good food+great service= many more repeat visits!! Date night :)"}
{"text":"I did not enjoy the food at this Chili's.  It was far too spicy for my individual taste.  To make matters worse, I watched an employee sweep the floor and under the table of the booth across from where I was eating.  He then proceeded to sweep the cushions of the booth with the same broom he had just finished sweeping the filthy floor with!  It was one of the NASTIEST things i have ever witnessed in a dining establishment!  It ruined my? appetite and I was not able to take another bite of the already awful food. I told the employee what he just did was not sanitary and that if he must do that type of \"cleaning\", it should not be done in the view of customers.  He said \"I can wipe it down if you want\".  Wrong reply!  It never should have happened!  I also told my server and he in turn told the manager.  The manager came to my table and just said \"what's going on?\"  He did not introduce himself or state his position.  I had to ask if he was the manager.  I told him what I saw his employee do but he did not seem apologetic whatsoever.  I got up to leave and told him I would never return to his restaurant.  Makes me wonder what other unsanitary things are going on in this Chili's."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting this location and it will be my last!!!!!!! First time I came it had just opened up so kind of gave them some slack and figured after receiving some gift card to try again. I should have went to the location on Litchfield I have never had a problem at that one. Anyways, once again my party of 5 walked in and no one to be found at the hostess station so we stood and looked around for someone finally about 5 mins later the hostess comes from the back in the meantime no else has bothered to ask if we needed help. She does not greet us at all, I tell her party of 5 she reaches down to grab menus and then starts counting my party and says how many 5? Yeah, I thought I already established that. We finally get seated and after a while our waiter comes over and gets drink orders which take a pretty long time considering it's a Weds evening and they are hardly busy at all. When he comes back doesn't bother asking if we have questions, mentions any specials, or ask if we want appetizers so we order our food 3 of my party have special instructions like no onions. A very long time later our food arrives a different waitress drops it off asked if we need anything we tell her yes, drink refills and sides of ranch she ok I get those for you. Well we never saw her again and we also noticed none of our special instructions have been taken care of. So everyone that didn't want onions got them. In the meantime our waiter asks if everything is ok we tell him well we told the other waitress what we needed more drinks and ranch he says ok. We are still waiting assuming one of the two will bring our requests. Didn't happen.  So after a good while half of my party is half way done with their food he sees me looking around and says do you need something. I said yeah all the stuff we asked for like 20 mins ago!!!!!!  So he take his sweet time to bring all our refills and sides of ranch. At this point we are almost done with our food and I just want to get out of here asap. The whole time the manager is of course no where to be found and the hostess leaves her post constantly so I see why we had the 1st problem, I could see from where I sat the same problem with multiple parties they walk in look around and no one is there to greet their customers. Very disappointing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dined with colleagues during our \"lunch hour.\"  Our food took nearly one hour to appear, and our entire experience there consumed over 100 minutes.  Suggest going elsewhere unless you have plenty of time to waste.  Half rack of ribs special was pretty good, but the asparagus was very salty and most was unchewable.  Had to take dessert to go, or we might have spent the entire afternoon there."}
{"text":"Things I've had here and how I feel:  Chips and Guac: Love it. I get it every time. Loaded Potato Skins: Pretty good. Not the best, but if you're a potato skin fan, you won't be disappointed. Buffalo Boneless Wings: I'm a sucker for breaded boneless wings. These wings did their job.  Mini burgers- Good! The bun it comes on is delicious. I think it may be a Hawaiian Sweet roll.  Sweet and Something Burger - Cooked well, delicious, crunchy onion ring inside Fries - Meh.   If you're a beer connoisseur like I am, don't go here for a drink. Beer selection is inadequate.  Service was okay, but I don't expect much from chain restaurants."}
{"text":"It's Chilis.  It's where you go because either nothing else is around or the person you wanted to eat dinner with has never eaten good food before in their life.  This location is convenient in Arboretum and serves up Chilis food as well as any place can.  Service has always been good as well.  There are plenty of local places in Arboretum so I'd suggest New South Kitchen or Cajun Yard Dog over Chilis, but it's not always my choice."}
{"text":"So I was at Chili's Too with my friends before our flight out, just jammin' on some raps and being seen by the people emerging from the homeland security checkpoint. Keith was recalling fond memories of meeting a toothless truck driver from the Netherlands the night before. It's not very often that you meet someone who you feel you would want to spend the rest of your life with, especially on a three day bender in Las Vegas. We all agreed that Keith would do well to track him down, profess his love and become a gay.   As an aside, Chili's Too, Las Vegas is to airport dining, what the Detroit Lions are to professional football.   As another aside, Dustin took a shit here, but strangely didn't have much to say about it."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time yesterday. The food was really good but this place is pretty pricey. We asked for extra cheese on your burger and didn't get any cheese, they were happy to fix it for us and apologized a few times. Our waitress Carolyn was super sweet and checked up on us just the right amount of times. Overall everything was good but the price !"}
{"text":"Service is very quick and efficient. Food came before I even finished my salad. Right now, for $35 you can have 2 margaritas, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and a large dessert. This place was so on time, but I definitely think management should reiterate how important it is to check ID, before serving alcohol. This was the 2nd day in a row no one asked, and I'm sure that could cost this restaurant their license."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst food and service I have experienced in Phoenix! Terrible. I had the chicken fajitas for $12.49 on July 4, 2015. The chicken tasted as it was boiled not grilled. Tasteless. The waiter forgot to bring my beer with the food and only appeared towards the end of the meal and asked if I wanted it. The condiments were so lame. Awful. The tortillas were hard as rocks and stale. When we paid it took forever to get our change so we could leave. The manager asked how things were and as we told him, he walked away. No apology. Never again will they see me. Their survey is a joke. Says it takes three minutes but is a joke because they ask about all kinds of other products. They can't stay in business very long at this rate."}
{"text":"Thursday, 10/30/2014 at dinnertime. No big crowd. No wait. Our party of two was seated at a booth. The young \"adult\" couple behind me had a kid, about 4, literally holding the top our shared seat and was jumping up and down. I could feel his breath on my neck. Our shared seat heaved with every bounce. His parents didn't seem to mind. The waitress, instead of asking the parents to rein in their little sh*t, thought it was fun. Until he knocked over a cup full of ice. It went everywhere. Some parents suck. We had the two for $20 special with guacamole, salsa and (awesome) tortilla chips as the appetizer and we each had fajitas. One pork and one chicken. Both were very good. I would go back. They run a \"kids eat free\" special now and then; I'd rather go without food on those days."}
{"text":"In my own mind, I have something of a three-tiered system.  For restaurants that try to be top quality, that's one tier.  For sit-down chain restaurants, that's another tier.  And then for fast food restaurants, that's another tier entirely.  Yesterday we ate at this Chili's; that would be a tier two kind of place.  For that tier, they have to beat Denny's.  Chili's manages that very well.  Yesterday, I had this soup that was new to me, a sweet corn soup, which I found to be excellent; I followed it with their standard bacon cheeseburger, which they overcooked a bit.  Edible.  I'm not fond of their french fries, though.  I think that they taste like they'd been frozen and then fried.  Overall, for me it was a good experience.  OTOH, my wife wasn't at all happy with her sandwich which consisted of steak in a pita roll; her meat was burned.  Comparing to Denny's, this was much better.  Comparing to the meal that we'd had the night before at a gourmet restaurant, this was much worse.  So, there you are."}
{"text":"First time here.  Very busy and very loud.  Music up to loud also.  Wife had the bacon burger with fries, I had the southern smokehouse with fries.  Very small burgers, but everything was great.  Just need to make the meat part of the burger bigger.  Great waiter kept the water glasses full."}
{"text":"Three strikes you're out! I actually can't recall what turned me off on my first visit. My second visit was an offense when the manager spoke to me in a tone that suggested I was a problem to be managed, rather than a valued customer to be served (my medium-rare sirloin came to me ice-cold).  Today I tried again because the location is good and I like the overall predictable atmosphere.  The server took 5 minutes to acknowledge me though there were only two customers seated at the bar. I ordered my beer and mentioned that the air conditioner was quite cold. She suggested that she \"could ask someone to turn it down, but it would take over an hour for the system to adjust the temperature anyway (shrug)\" I assured her it would respond within a minute or so, and she grudgingly complied with a snarled affect. Fortunately, the freezing air subsided and the ribs were fine. Unfortunately, her tip reflected her attitude. I suppose it's reasonable that this spot is focused on the short term visits from the extended stay hotel across the street but repeat locals should avoid it."}
{"text":"Saw something totally different each table has a little kiosk/that let's you order drinks when you wish as well as pay your bill straight from the table.   I can see how this can be useful and help with service especially when they are busy. Only thing I wonder is how much this actually takes away from the human interaction of quality customer service.  If it can all be done by a machine then other than actually bringing out the food and drinks, what is the point of having a server?   I had the Santa few chicken salad and it was delicious! Big chunks of chicken, tasty salsa dressing  and crisp lettuce. It was a very refreshing salad with the right kick added to the taste."}
{"text":"Either Chili's has upped their game, or I was exceptionally hungry after a long day of riding quads out on the trails.   It must have been at least seven years since my last visit to a Chili's, and my overall impression at that time was \"meh\".  Today our defenses were down, and we were looking for a place that was somewhat quick and somewhat inexpensive; Chili's is close to home, so after a round of showers we headed over.  With hunger levels high, we ordered the fresh tableside guacamole/salsa and spinach artichoke dip to get started. The menu highlighted their \"fresh guacamole, prepared at your table, customized by you\" with a list of add-ins you could choose from; what we got was a big platter of fresh, hot chips, a big bowl of tasty-if-not-customized guac, and pretty decent salsa.  We were a bit confused, but in our peckish state did not  consider fussing.  Also ordered by our table of four were the Big Mouth Bites (sliders), chicken and steak fajitas, the chipotle chicken bowl, and a Pick Two combo of salmon and shrimp.  The consensus was the food was well prepared, well seasoned, and generally tasty."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner a couple of weeks back.  Waitress who was manning the bar had a bit of an attitude on her.  She wasn't unfriendly, but she spoke to me in a rather condescending manner.  I'm a big believer that customer service employees need to check their attitudes at the door when they come to work.  Other customers at the bar seemed kind of uncouth as well.  Next time I'm in this area I think I'll pass up this Chili's and head to the Applebee's just up the road.  Same basic quality of food with a friendlier waitstaff and less sketchy clientele."}
{"text":"Holy cow. How have I missed the *Smoked Wings* all this time? They are unbelievably good. If Other Mama put out wings like this, people would be freaking out. And during Happy Hour (which is all-day on Sundays) a basket of about 9 wings is only $5. They are moist, smoked, fall-off-the-bone chicken wings like you've never experienced. 5 stars for these smoked wings!  3 stars for the understaffed bar area and those who were working seemed to be afflicted by a malaise of sorts, perhaps it was incidental. Usually bad management is to blame for low morale - it'll be interesting to observe the staff during my next visit.   I visited at 11am on a Sunday, and the floors were pretty filthy. A shame because the interior of this Chili's is well-appointed and was recently remodeled to corporate modern Chili's spec. Plenty of HDTVs all on different channels and iPad-like menus on every table top. Perfect under-the-radar spot to watch sports events. Ironically in the same parking lot as the Martini...  Footnote: IMO, everything on the Chili's menu is waaayyyy better than Applebee's. It's no contest, really!"}
{"text":"The service and food was fine, but a misunderstanding with management over a stupid \"free appetizer\" from an emailed along with the delays to fix it really set me off. Manager didn't want to take the appetizer from the check but the server was the one who hit accept on my phone, then he proceeded to me this bullsh!t on how it can't be taken off the check but once he found out it was already claimed by the server it was easy to take off. At the point I just give me my change so I could leave but that took long too. So I'm being nice by still giving 3 stars even though I was irate af."}
{"text":"Not sure why this location has such low score. My wife and I have been here several times.. Always received great service and great food. Love the 2 for $22 menu choices. Chips and salsa are one of our favorite appetizers. She likes the flavored tea here. Good burgers, awesome fajitas among other great choices. Good kids meal choices as well."}
{"text":"Have taken my wife here several times for lunch because her work is nearby. Always great service. Love the 2 for $22 menu choices. Chips and salsa are one of our favorite appetizers. She likes the flavored tea here. Good burgers, awesome fajitas among other great choices."}
{"text":"Week before Christmas, with family and friends from out of town. The upper management at this restaurant decided to under staff. Really what are they thinking? There were empty tables but only a couple of servers. Not fair to the young servers or the manager on staff. We were going to have 8 people over but the host said \"15-20 min wait\" and we see empty tables . Oh well the party decided to go else where. We waited though."}
{"text":"Chili'a oh how could I have forgotten about you my love?!   It's been forever and now that we've been hear I think we shall be chowing down here new often again.  Came in at 11am and sat at the bar to see the MLB games. Our waiter was busy with about 8 people sitting near the bar but he constantly was attentive and funny. Offered Hastings but said its a little early aye? Yeah, not unless your an alcoholic we said :)  Got a 6 buck combo and an 8 buck combo, what a deal. Both came with the choice of soup or salad. We chose the enchilada soup, which was super tasty! Large bowl too. Then as the main entree the hubby picked a BLT with fries and I got a grilled chicken breast with avocado, bacon and spring lettuce on Texas toast. Bomb diggitty!! Talk about great sized portions.  Us being the fatties we are... (Actually we just skipped breakfast so we were starving) we got an appetizer to accompany our lunches. We got the triple trio, and chose hamburger bites, baked potatoes and chicken strips. The hamburger bites were great, and had bacon bites and ranch on them. Sadly they're were only two :( next the potatoes were fully loaded and had sour cream to dip in. Lastly the chicken strips were beer battered and extremely tender. Nom nom nom, get in my belly!"}
{"text":"Good stuff!  Consistently good food and service - good drinks - good specials - fresh guacamole chips and salsa.  The presidente margarita is delicious.  Seat yourself in the bar area without waiting."}
{"text":"Service is excellent. Waiters were constantly walking around and refilling everyone's drinks, and they were very responsive considering it was 6pm and crowded. Music volume was just right. A very clean and well-kept restaurant.  I ordered the Big Mouth Bites. The bacon chunks gave it a very nice texture, but overall the meal was alright. I couldn't taste the burger or its toppings either because it was too dull or the (sweet) bread was overpowering. Fries were nice and crunchy."}
{"text":"0 stars but they made me pick at least 1 star. This chilis location apparently does not practice healthy sanitation. I had a quesadila salad last Friday night and within 2 hours was sick with food poisoning. Beware!"}
{"text":"For a chain this place is great... The chips and salsa is AOK The Bean burger is better than a lot of other places. and the desserts are good too (the blondie brownie) the servers are kinda rude and uninformed though."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Chili's in FOREVER but those darn gift cards get me every time. Stopped by today for dinner and we ordered the 2 for 20 special (an app and 2 entrees).   The food was alright-we ordered the Spicy Chicken Fajitas, the Bacon Chicken Quesadilla and started off with the Onion and Jalapeno Stack. The jalapenos were lame but everything else tasted great after a long day at work.  What was not so great was the service. Two waiters introduced themselves (I figured one was training) but neither bothered to stop by and fill up our drinks or really check in. The girl who served us seemed to spend most of her time on the other side of the dining room and the teen host actually ended up being the one to refill my Strawberry Lemonade. So thanks to the young dude manning the desk and NOT my slow waiterS."}
{"text":"This used to be on the corner of Mill and University. They shut it down, and now they are on University just a little West of Mill.  Lots of parking here, it is a modern looking place and quite large inside. Food was pretty good I have to say. Our service on both visits was great! Of course we had the same girl both times so maybe that is why. The check out computers are on the table, attached. Which is a little different. But, after you figure it out, I guess it is all the new rage!  I got the steak both times, better than a lot of places for sure. Cooked as I ordered it. Constant refills on the Ice Teas as well. Reasonable prices, decent food, good service. What more can you ask."}
{"text":"Love coming to this location. Especially there's a cute waiter therewas disappointed cause they did run out of queso. Had to wait 20 mins for it but it didn't even feel hot or warm and didn't feel fresh. Usually the queso is the best. Literally the only reason I love coming to Chilis with the chips and salsa. Their food is good. I usually get the chicken crispers or ribs which I love."}
{"text":"Food's not bad but the service is so terrible, we can't go there anymore.  The manager is a little guy with a chip on his shoulder.  Lots of staff running around, but no organization and don't bother complaining to him - he'll blame it on you, or his staff, or who knows what else.  We used to eat here often.  Ray and Amy were great.  They cared despite this manager, who the entire staff despises.  Now they're gone, and customers are on their own.  Don't go there."}
{"text":"I went here with my mom and my mom's friend on July 21st 2017 and the chicken crisper's were good and the queso was delicious and our waiter was supper nice to us and we didn't have any problems with this Chill's in Champaign.  I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I would like to give them 5 stars but sometimes the service here can be iffy. I love the chicken enchilada soup, also the triple dipper is good. The price isn't too bad either . normally there is no wait time so if your looking for a place to eat that's reasonably priced this place will do"}
{"text":"Coming here made me wanna just cook at home and even clean it up afterwards. The fact that the wait was long and than once we were seated the wait for the server to show up was longer too!! I went around 7:30ish and it was on Valentine's Day. So i can understand the wait before getting a table but just don't appreciate having to wait for the server to show up. Got the Valentine dinner special, 2 for $35.   Got the table side guac($2.00 upgrade), bacon cheeseburger, half rack of ribs, 2 Presidential martinis and than finished it off with the white chocolate molten cake. Waited so long our hunger was just striding away my g/f took her ribs Togo and I ate most of my bacon burger but just felt exhausted from all the waiting we had to do. Server was very friendly tho once she got to our table. When it comes to the food it was edible but Chilli's is Chilli's I mean who hasn't been to Chilli's!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this chilis, I get the honey chipoltle chicken crispers. Its amazning! All white meat-- no surprises, comes with choice of side ( i get fries and corn on the cob) the corn is over salted in my opinion but thats easily fixed with a napkin.  Our waitresses always seem to impress wiith their attentiveness and politeness. They have new ziosks, basically a little tablet you can play games on and pay your bill on. My date accidentally clicked a game and it charges us and our waitress was happy to take it off for us. Only complaint I have is if you have a party of 5 or more, you pretty much have to sit at a table because they dont have big booths. Excellent service makes up for it though.. Seriously, they servers KNOW what they are doing."}
{"text":"First time in a Chilli's and the experience it was correct. Service was fast and friendly, the appetizers looked like pre cooked. My burger was very tasty, the cheese bites were so so. Nice patio, good marguerita, cool Ziosk . Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food and price are good. But the one thing that stuck with me was our server, Inis. Very sweet girl."}
{"text":"Bar Area great for chips/salsa and cheap beer.  The ribs tasted like they were previously-frozen, and microwaved. The burgers were not that good.  The food should be better for what they charge here."}
{"text":"I was greeted and sat down waited for 10 mins while other waiters looked at me. The waitress who was working my section greeted the others in area and avoided me. Well! That's thee last time I waste my time in this place.  I wouldn't recommend this location ever!! Just might call the manager when I get a moment."}
{"text":"Called for menu information and was left on hold for more than ten minutes until someone answered and was bounced around to different people, none of which could answer menu questions to the restaurant THEY WORK AT. Looking at stupidity in the rear view mirror."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad. It's what you expect from a family type, American grill. The food is okay and the prices are good. This place has gotten steadily busy since it opened a few years back and I'm glad. All the people who work here are so nice, they deserve it."}
{"text":"Chili's has been a go too for me for years.  Have frequented this location may times over the years, probably 5-7 times a year, as well as other locations.  Has always been consistently good food, great atmosphere and acceptable price.  I was sad when they removed the Cajan chicken sandwich from the menu :( but have no complaints.  Highly reccomend this, and every other Chili's in the valley."}
{"text":"Blonde is a great waitress at the bar. I like the enchiladas and Lisa likes the Salad. Great drinks. Tasty guacamole.  Service is quick. I like the pizza kind and the specials that I get emailed to me."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband for our anniversary.  Def wasn't our first choice. After dropping off our month and a half infant at the babysitter it left us with little time, worst part was we had made reservations at a place across town. Thinking on our feet we settled for outback which was 3 blocks away. Hoping to get a table there was an hour wait. I couldn't believe it. Especially when this outback had horrible reviews on Yelp.   Looking across the street we spotted this Chili's and opted for it.   We searched and searched for about ten minutes for a place to park. It didn't help especially when my hubby is picky about where he parks. [his mustang is his life] but this time he had no choice. Any parking spot would have to do.   Finally getting inside we noticed people were waiting. We prayed th eline wouldn't be long. The hostess told us the wait would be 30 minutes and she told us to take a seat and it'd go by fast. The next people that came in we're told they could wait in the bar.. gee i wish they would have told us that, i could have used a couple drinks. next, another couple came in and were seated right away. My husband got up to ask why and the hostess announced that you can go online and be put on the waiting list. Good to know for future nights to chili's. That'll def save time and help my poor tummy from starving.  Once we were seated a nice good looking gentlemen came and asked if it was our first time there or if we were familiar with the menu or specials. We said we'd been there a few times but not in a while so he explained every thing clearly and even offered which drinks were the best tasting.   I ordered a strawberry margarita, which i thought ended up being way too sweet and i always order strawberry margaritas when i go out. The hubby got a martini and another drink but i cant remember the name of that one. Food wise, he ordered the beef fajitas which he thought was delicious but not very much meat. Mostly veggies such as bell peppers. I ordered the fish taco's. They were very dry, but good. My favorite and his on our plates was the rice. So moist and fluffy. Probably one of the best rice's i've had a restaurant that wasn't authentic mexican.   So basically i gave 3 stars for the waiter and the rice, haha.. other than that it was just an okay experience nothing special."}
{"text":"Taking a chill out on Chili's. My friend and I frequent this location usually once a month, occasionally more, & always sit in the bar area. Our favorite is the Presidente Margarita. YUM!!! This has become the staple of our visit and often times, the reason we choose Chili's. We were very excited to hear the margaritas were being featured on a dinner for two deal - perfect! Except that choices, well, kinda suck. The steak wasnt good, and since we dont get the combo. Upon our most recent visit, we both noticed that we were definitely shorted on our margaritas. Asked the server/bartender Jake, whom we've had before several times, if the recipe has changed and he swore it hadn't and said that it must have been that every single time before it was made incorrectly. He told us how he makes it and we reminded him that he's made our drinks for us on multiple occasions. The thing about Jake is that he is so super cheesy, he wouldn't admit it anyways. He should work with kids and families, not bar folk. We both felt insulted and disappointed that the margs we have to come to love so much can no longer fill our glasses two times. Not sure we'll be coming back. Def gonna take some time out to chill."}
{"text":"Couldn't ask for better service if you have Cole taking care of you in the bar area.  Very personalized experience. He wants guests to thoroughly enjoy their meals and the experience as a whole which is a welcome rarity these days! Great food, excellent service!"}
{"text":"Worst airport Chilis, waiter was not helpful, Queso Salsa chips were more salt then chips, and none of the food can be made to order or customized as we were informed that all the food is made in the afternoon. I've eaten at several airport Chilis and this one is by far the worst! Stay away!"}
{"text":"Good bartenders but food is ok now.. I used to like the burger but it taste bland and I've had better before from this Chilli's so I'm going to take a break and hope when I get back.. It has made improvements!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the past three times we have been there the service has been terrible, and the food not much better. It's my son's favorite restaurant so I keep trying but we are now done guess we'll try the one on rainbow and see if they can do any better"}
{"text":"Foods great, a variety of options but not everything. Background music is always fun. Service is great and food is quick."}
{"text":"Location is not the best, we only knew it was here because I'm a frequent Wal Mart shopper. Place was packed and we were seated quickly. Our waitress was nice but slow, it took too long just to bring us drinks. Another waitress who saw us impatiently waiting put in a 2 nd round of drinks while our waitress was nowhere to be found. Ordered the trio appetizer, yum! But my trio fajita was bland, seasoning was on there but it didn't taste like it. Hubby's steak was yummy, so I ate that. If we come again I'll know to put in my full order with 2 rounds of drinks just in case my waitress goes MIA"}
{"text":"Will NEVER go back to this location EVER. Steak nachos came out burned followed by steak fajitas that tasted rancid! Received a new order of nachos which were OK followed by another rancid order of steak fajitas. At an attempt to rectify the situation, we received a free molten chocolate lava cake which half way through we found a long hair in! Still received a bill for our mediocre nachos and drinks at the end of the meal- ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Eh. For some reason during lunch, although they did not seem busy (I'm assuming because all employees were standing around on their phones), it took about 5 minutes to be greeted, another 20 for our food, and an extra 10 to get the bill because our Ziosk wasn't working. Our server had a friendly enough voice, yet had the angriest look throughout the entire meal and right before leaving we overheard another server specifically say \"I hate Chili's so much\" to the hostess. I thought these super corporate restaurant chains were supposed to have some of the happiest employees?   Also, I'm not one for having to be dolled up every moment, but the employees here look like they've all had a rough night. It's like a weird teenage hangout, but the teenagers are adults?"}
{"text":"I've gone to Chili's in the past, but this was my first visit to this location. We stopped here after a day of hiking in the Superstitions.  First of all, the wait staff was great, very attentive and friendly. However, the food was not good. One of the dishes I regularly order at Chili's is the Margarita Chicken. I ordered this, and seriously it did not taste like any other Margarita Chicken I've ordered. The beans, are suppose to be black, these tasted like baked red beans, the ones you get from a can. The rice, I don't even know what was wrong with it, but it was disgusting! The chicken had this sauce on it, that I've never seen before. And it was kinda under done.   After this experience, I would not return to this location."}
{"text":"Usually the service at Chili's is decent, but today they split the tables and one waitress, our primary waitress, was pretty flat out horrible. The entire night our waitress was simply rude with a poor attitude. Turns out she was a \"trainer\" for another waitress, and here I was thinking she was the trainee.   Ordering a simple salad was a chore because finding out what dressing was vegan was a tall hop, skip and a jump through their staff and ziosk atop the table. They weren't understanding that I couldn't have honey and continued to suggest items containing it.   When asking how to navigate the ziosk's dietary restrictions, all I got was hostility.   Surprise, when it was time to get the check, she turned the charm on and according to our bill, the sour server was named Becky."}
{"text":"So I must admit -- my expectations were pretty low. Chilis for breakfast? A first for me. However, I had 1.5 hours to kill until my flight departed and opted for a seated breakfast option. The hostess was friendly and seated me promptly. I selected the hot cakes, but subbed the bacon for breakfast potatoes. They came out super fast, but it was obvious they were made to order. Yummy pancakes with syrup and butter. The breakfast potatoes were hot and crispy with a sprinkle of seasoning on top. The waitress was also very friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend if you have an early flight. Good job Chilis!"}
{"text":"I really don't like to review chains people I think people generally know what to expect but for this Chili's, I will make an exception.  I went in with a few girlfriends on a Sunday afternoon. We were seated immediately and introduced to our server. 10 minutes pass, and she finally stops by to take our drink and appetizer orders. 15 minutes later (after asking two people) our drinks arrive, just a minute after our queso appetizer. Throughout our dinner we received very little service, and it wasn't busy.  The food was good, not great, but definitely good for a chain. I wouldn't recommend the queso, which is more of a chili than a cheese. It had a weird texture too.   I'll try this location again.. hopefully it was just an off day or a new hire."}
{"text":"Sunday evening and they were not very busy..... Ordered appetizers and they came 40 minutes later with no explanation for the delay. 30 minutes later 1st entree showed up, waitress came back 2 minutes later and took it back (after my son had touched it (no bites yet). She said it was for another table. 10 minutes later 3 entrees came but not the 4th. It showed up 15 minutes later.  Never an explanation or apology from Cieral, our waitress.  When the check was presented and ask how everything was. When told the delays were excessive she still had no explanation or apology... in fact seemed a little put out at me for commenting.  Not again any time soon. Tom G"}
{"text":"The overall experience was lower than I rated it because I have been here before and it was a great experience. On this visit, It took over an hour and 20 minutes to get our food! Half of our groups food was cold. The entire dinner took over 2 hours."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times with friends and family. The service was alright and nothing to complain about. They refill drink on time. Sadly, apparently they charge 99 cents for playing on that tablet and I didn't know so I lost my 99 cents (sounds petty but there wasn't a warning on the screen). Their elotes were great."}
{"text":"So you decide what your conclusion is... Store closes at 11pm on Tuesday, sitting there and they shut the lights off at 10:50, leaving me and my girlfriend in the dark to finish our drinks and talk for the remaining time. Legally a bar must stay open for 30 min after last call but I guess chilis wanted us out.. Shitty way to treat customers.."}
{"text":"My sister got the steak and prime rib fajita meal. The prime rib was very close to raw and likely contaminated. She experienced such horrible, violent food poisoning from this meal. Their food is never spectacular, but if you want to spend your weekend cleaning up projectile vomit and wearing a diaper because you've become incontinent this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Damn this place was busy when I went there.   My experience at this Chili's was partially tainted by the date that I brought with me who tried to convert me to her religion half way through dinner, so bear with me folks.   Here's the deal. I'm a \"Metro Kid\" at heart. I grew up wandering around the MetroCenter area and was still around when the terrible decline of the area took effect. It was very sad for me to see all of the businesses start closing down, being replaced by nothing.   Fast-forward to now days and look at the revitalization of the area! Is it perfect? No, it's far from it. But it is getting better every year and that's great news! Chili's is one of the newer spots that opened up as a part of the revitalization of the periphery of the MetroCenter area.   I stopped in for a dinner date with a girl and waited at the front entrance for her. The parking is pretty good at this location, despite the fact that it does share a parking lot with several other businesses in the same plaza.  The service and the food at this Chili's were fine. It was too busy for it to be excellent, as our server has WAY too many tables to take good care of us. But our orders came out well and everything was fine in terms of food. Drink refills were sparse through.   Would I come back?   It's possible.   I think I would avoid Saturday evening though as it was just way too crowded and understaffed for the servers to take good care of everyone. The food here is average for a Chili's."}
{"text":"Our family loves going to Chili's! We live in Utah (and eat there as well, Orem UT location). This time, we got NICK as our server! You want Nick! He is super funny, friendly, outgoing & pretty freakin spectacular!  I DO NOT GET PAID TO DO REVIEWS. I DO THESE FOR OTHER TRAVELLERS, BECAUSE IT'S GOOD TO KNOW AHEAD! I WOULD NEVER FAKE-A-REVIEW. Just so we're clear. I've never met Nick before seeing him, in action, last night at dinner @ Chili's.  He went above & beyond, made sure everything was 100% and we all really enjoyed our visits and the laughter, the-Nick will bring! Ask for The-Nick waiter! He shall not disappoint!   Cheers!"}
{"text":"We were visiting with friends at Chili's. The staff was very friendly, and our servers were helpful. We had a very nice visit because the atmosphere was pleasant.  The food was good. The chips and salsa are always enjoyable, and the ribs were great.  All our orders were correct. The restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"We seldom go here because it's in the North Hills and the parkways suck.  The food was good but nothing spectacular ranging from ribs to salads.  I tried a vampire IPA which was different and strong but got better as I acquired a taste.  Our sons ribs came out cold and they knocked off 50% which he received new hot ones but basically ate by himself.  Chilis is your typical corporate restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here because we wanted ice cream in the area and everything was closed. We shared some and had to ask for plates. When we got them one had mystery condiment streaked on it and the other had thick dried water on it. It was hard to eat off it. I did it and can say I am okay today. As for the ice cream, not that great, I should have just gone to the market and made my own."}
{"text":"Ok, so I love Chilis. Everybody always jokes on me about it but its always my go to for a affordable night out.  But this one is not the one to go to.  So one day I went with two other people to this location, I immidiatly went to the restroom while they waited for a table. I found them sitting at a table where they told me that we are leaving. They said they came in and saw the health score (this was a couple of months ago and it seems that their score had improved, I believe it was 93 or something like that before) and asked the host why it was low( kinda just having small talk not really expecting him to tell the truth). He said he just started so not completely sure, but if you saw the way the kitchen look then you would know! :O . Yea so we left.  So last month me and my husband was in the area and wanted chilis and for some reason we thought to actually give it a try since we did go all the time before that horrific last visit. I wish we didn't go. Everything was horrible Cheese fries were dry and seemed old. I mean pick up one fry and the whole pile come up with is because the hard dry cheese molded it all together. I got their chicken crispers and fries. I asked if it could be tossed in buffalo sauce. It came out with tenders barely covered with sauce. Cold tender at that. Even the fries were cold. Can I point out it was a slow night? Don't even bother giving it a chance. On the boarder is beside them and they never fail me."}
{"text":"Didn't get a chance to eat.    Ignorant,  short, bald  ugly white server watched me be seated in his area, ignored me for 10 min, then as soon as the white group sat down he was right in their asses."}
{"text":"We visit this place regularly.  I always end up getting the triple dipper appetizer for dinner.  Never been disappointed.  Happy hour in the lounge is a great excuse to get out without having to put up with the regular bar scene."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with a party of 7! Was told we would have a 40 min wait cause a huge party arrived just before us! We came in at 7:45! Asked about all the empty tables and was told they didn't have enough servers! Then two tables opened up right next to each other so I said we'd take those and again was told that it was two different servers?!? Really??!! Guess you don't want business?? TGI Fridays right across the way sat us happily!!"}
{"text":"For a restaurant in an airport this was good.  First, who doesn't like Chili's? This place didn't disappoint. The mushroom burger was A-OK. The service was quick and the waiter returned to the table a few times to check in and make sure things were ok. He seemed to always be filling up our glasses.   The place is popular and seems to be always full. They sure can pack the people in here."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to chain restaurants, but sometimes when you want a menu with variety you have to. This Chili's location is an exception. The food could be horrible and I'd still go for one not so simple reason, the bartender. He has the Cheers vibe. For those of you whipper snappers who don't know the Cheers reference, Google it. The bartender always remembers us even if it has been over a year. He's loyal and has a knack for knowing what subject to converse about. A great bartender can change the way food tastes. Keep up the great work Toby."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice. They have very slow service. We waited a while for our food and even longer just to pay the bill and leave. I dont recommend this location. Maybe if you're just picking up food to go."}
{"text":"It's been better but tonight they had empty tables and no one to clean them. Then she sat us at a table for two that was empty when we first walked in, ugh. Not happy tonight"}
{"text":"Staff is very nice very clean restaurant Services really slow in for too much alcohol not made very well otherwise very well experienced"}
{"text":"Awesome service!!! Sean was wonderful. Very patient with my uncle and answered all of his questions and guided him to a good meal decision. Thank you so much! Food came out fast and was super delicious! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Chilis is our favorite place to eat in town and they never let us down. The servers are also very friendly and personable. They always make sure our water glasses are full and we have everything we need once our food is brought to us. The food is always excellent, I don't think I've ever had anything to complain about when we eat at Chili's."}
{"text":"I waited 3 times as long for my meal. And all I ordered Texas fries. 3ppl ordered after me and my order came last?"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were incredibly salty. Nachos were paper thin and salsa was some watery mix of salsa and red sauce. Service, while friendly, was very slow."}
{"text":"Went for brunch today with my wife, and I'm happy I did it. Great food and great service! We had a smokehouse combo and a bud light and it was just great."}
{"text":"Terrible Experience. We arrived and we're seated right away. Our server didn't take our beverage order for a considerable amount of time on a day where it is 115 degrees outside. Once we ordered it took approximately 25 minutes to get out. The fries came out cold, and I had to chase down the waiter for drink refills. The venue wasn't even busy so I don't understand why these issues occurred. This was the worst Chili's experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"For taking order they took 30 mins & had to wait for one more hour to get the food!!  Food is average and definitely not worth a wait!  Waitress changed in between to hanover to another one!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday at 12pm for lunch for a party of 3.  There was no wait and our table was clean.  Our server was really pleasant.  I had the mini hamburgers, and they were delicious.  As a small person, I hate giant cheeseburgers that are hard for me to bite into, so these were great!  They also came with fries which were yummy as usual.    Our drinks were always refilled promptly.  One of my family members had a beer, and it was huge!  Be forewarned.     Bathrooms were fairly clean, but not great.    Over all, I would say this place is pretty standard for a Chili's, but it gets an extra star from me for the extra good service and food when I visited."}
{"text":"I would rate this place Zero stars if possible. Completely horrible service. The restaurant was not busy and we were seated immediately. It then took 20 minutes (no exaggeration) before a manager took our drink order. After that, no one came to our table. I then flagged the same manager down and she took our food order and then told us a different server would help us. The different server came by and said hello. I ordered a tableside guacamole that took another twenty minutes before he walked back to our table with the ingredients. Then, my table mate failed to receive her appetizer salad until we asked for it AFTER the meal arrived. I ordered fajitas and the order came out wrong (ordered steak and chicken and received steak and shrimp). I then asked for the chicken and it never arrived (even after reminding the server twice). The steak was tough (couldn't cut it with a knife without sawing) and I finally gave up. We then asked for the check and waited another 20 minutes while our server chatted with his friends at the next table.  This is the worst Chili's I've ever been too and the worst service I've ever received here. Do NOT go to this location. The Arboretum location is superb and I'm wholly flabbergasted at how awful in comparison this one is."}
{"text":"Kids love coming here and the food is always what we expect and the drinks are cold.   Great family atmosphere.   Servers all have great attitudes."}
{"text":"Worst burger ever. Old French fries probably sitting out for hours. Woke up this morning with food poisoning. I will never return to a chilis location."}
{"text":"Old skool location which is cool... but if Zoe is your waitress asked to be moved. She is absolutely terrible as a server. Good luck getting a refill or anything when she's on the case. Other than Zoe's lousy service pretty par for a Chili's."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?   Service was bad this time, wings were choking-ly dry! 2 months before yesterday the burger was gross but service was good. They used to have better food!"}
{"text":"Ordered the steak & chicken frijita   Chicken was good but the steak was very tough. Disappointed! Con queso dip was great."}
{"text":"Service was amazing!!! Our waitress was super nice and fast!!! The California Grilled Chicken Flatbread is probably the best thing I've had in a very long time!!! It serves a great meal and it's absolutely delicious!!! I love it!!! The nachos and salsa are also very good and fresh! The chicken crushers are great!!! Restaurant was clean! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Service seems to have gotten much better!!! They were friendly and fast!!! They got my order right accurately and double checked many times to make sure what I got was correct. The food was delicious and got done at the appropriate time!! I am so happy to be able to enjoy this location again!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service (Thanks Penny) Excellent food! Best Happy Hour in town. Football games going on every channel & they are truly happy to see you!!"}
{"text":"Ordered some food to-go... a kids pizza meal, some boneless buffalo wings and a side salad, and a chicken quesadilla. asked the person on the phone to put everything on the side for the quesadilla. now, this is not the first time i have ordered a quesadilla, and not the first time i have ordered it for to-go and asked for everything on the side, you know, the Pico de gallo sour cream guacamole, the toppings, so the quesadilla isnt getting soggy with toppings on top of it, RIGHT? well, THATS NOT WHAT THEY DID. they seperated EVERYTHING, in the to go box. it WOULD BE a quesadilla, the chicken, the cheese, the tortilla, and all the toppings, seperated, and not put together yet...???? still having a hard time wrapping my head around the idea that they reallyyyyy thought that i just ordered a $7 or $8 quesadilla from a restaurant, just to take it home and make it myself on my stove. are you serious?? and for her to not even verify that this strange request was what i really wanted she just did it that way and then i get there to pick up my order and had to wait for them to MAKE a quesadilla not just pack up the ingredients in a to go box. i will not return to this restaurant to pay them for such blatant stupidity when the whole point of going to a restaurant is NOT cooking in the first place... idiots!"}
{"text":"I went during dinner on a Friday night so I expected it to be crowded. Me and the other three guest in our party were seated in about 20 minutes so no complaints there.   It did take about 15 minutes before someone came and asked us what drinks we wanted but by then we already knew what we wanted to eat including appetizers so it made it easier on all of us.   I had the southwest pairings meal and the texas cheese fries (best pregnancy craving ever) Everyone else in my party seemed to enjoy their food.  I do love that they have the z-tablet now at all the tables. You don't have to wait to pay your waiter no more and it prints the receipt right out there. You can scan your coupons there as well and refill/order drinks and order desert without doing the awkward waving and staring at your waiter/waitress till they acknowledge you. For 99 cents you can play games on it which is good since my boyfriend has the patience of a child sometimes.  Great way to save money is the 2 for 20 meal which is an appetizer and two entrees (which would normally cost 30+) or for $35 you get two margaritas and a desert along with your entrees.   The lunch portions are nicely prices as well. Between 11am-4pm, you can choose a lunch portion of some favorites which comes with your choice of soup or salad."}
{"text":"Don't enjoy chains much, but was with a group. Pleasantly surprised with this Chili's in Charlotte and it's new menu. Tasty fried cauliflower!! Also enjoyed the appetizer plate with pick 3. Sliders were juicy and flavorful, boneless wings, too much breading.  Still noisy atmosphere, but we were in private room with poor acoustics."}
{"text":"I would like to say that Ray was a perfect host. The food was a little slow but the service did make up for it."}
{"text":"Not good, have been to Chillis many times before at other locations but this was a travesty, 3 people for lunch, 1 guy had big long red hair in his drink, 1 guy got cold leftover Mac and Cheese, 1 salad was half the size and when addressed the waitress brought dry lettuce with a side of ranch to I guess make up for it? We had to ask the hostess for utensils because the server disappeared, manager came by and was told about all, she said oh sorry but have a good day and walked away, I would rather sit in my office and feast on dry oatmeal than ever go back here."}
{"text":"We went here for a quick bite to eat on a Monday night and it was packed! Despite the crowd, our party of three and a quarter (my toddler!) were able to be seated almost immediately. You know how they say 'a smile is contagious?' Well, it's true because the staff was delightful. We has three different waiters help us and each were incredibly friendly. I was impressed by the rather happy vibe that seemed to spray through the whole restaurant. It was so refreshing! The service was great. We got our food and drinks quickly. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. I was craving a burger but decided against it and this tasty sandwich (grilled chicken, cheese, bacon and honey mustard) fulfilled my craving. My daughter got the chicken crispers with mashed potatoes. She is picky but enjoyed both! My friends got the Buffalo chicken salad and the old fashioned cheeseburger. Our whole table was extremely satisfied! Before actually dining here, I was bagging on Chili's and I walked out full and happy, with the rest of my party feeling the same. This Chili's definitely knows how to take care of their customers. Good job, guys!"}
{"text":"Thank you chili's staff for accommodating my child's mango allergy. What a wonderful friendly staff. Great food! Great service! Will definately be back!"}
{"text":"We find ourselves here from time to time when we let our son decide where to go. It's also a first day of school tradition so we went there for dinner tonight. The place is clean and comfortable and the staff tonight was very friendly. Our server was quick with the refills and the food came out fast and hot. The food quality is just ok. The menu is old and tired and although they add a few new things some of them are terrible like the fried pickles. I like fried pickles but I would never order them here again. Everything that is fried has the same slightly off flavor. We did the 2 for $20 deal which is two entrees and a appetizer. The price is great! I had the chicken ranch quesadillas. They weren't bad but they were a bit stingy with the sour cream. My husband had the honey chipotle crispers which he likes and our son had the mini cheeseburgers. Dinner for three was $33 not including the tip."}
{"text":"3/14/17  Lunch at Chili's. Excellent fresh Fresco salad, turkey sandwich. Beautiful light chips with the salsa. Jordan & Kenzie took extra fine care of their customers. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"2 attempts at Ribs were hard and unedible. Pasta dish my friend ordered was cold. My fajitas were meh.. tortillas could've been fresher. Sister ordered chickens tenders and the dough was not done enough. Cocky un attentive servers and a piss mood manager. Not again. And our server ditched us and got replaced by another pissy server. 2nd manager was nice but was a unholy disaster  over all"}
{"text":"These fuckers were rude and unprofessional. I placed an to go order now mind you there closing time is at 11 pm so I got there around 10:20 and the doors were locked. So all their employess stood there and looked at me like I was crazy. Long story short I went home hungry and angry not a good combo. That really pissed my off."}
{"text":"Very unexceptional.  Service slow though didn't not appear very busy at all.  Food was unremarkable. Not the Chili's we used to know :("}
{"text":"Food was great! Shantell was the bombest server I've ever met. Really wished I could've brought her home with me. Suggestive selling was fantastic and the restaurant was clean and the atmosphere is very welcoming. I love the spirit and enjoy the employees every time I go. This chili's is the best hands down :)"}
{"text":"Wanted the Big Mouth Bites, but only 2 of them (appetizer size order)....nope.  you can have 2 if you order the Triple Dipper, or you must have 4 from the main menu.  Yes, you read that right; they WILL cook you 2 of them, if you buy stuff you don't want or they will only cook you 4 of them."}
{"text":"When we went it was still happy hour (I only know because the little table top computers were telling me). When our waiter came over we ordered two beers. She asked if we wanted large or small, we said large. When she brought our drinks they were both rather small but before I could even ask if these were the large ones she fled from the table. Once she finally came back, sometime after, we ordered our food. When she brought our food, she had forgotten half of it and come to find out she never even put the order in!  She never apologized, never said \"I'm going to get that out for you as soon as possible\", nothing! She just said \"oh\" and left for another 15 minutes. By time she brought the other half of the order we didn't even want it but yet again she was nowhere to be found. When we went to just pay our bill because we were over waiting, our beers weren't even on the happy hour price!!! Rather than trying to track her down, we just said screw it, paid the bill and left.  What I noticed was: 1. Our waitress never wrote anything we ordered down. Clearly she couldn't remember it all so maybe she needs to start to ensure better customer service and correct orders. 2. They think that because they have these table top machines where you can pay, they never have to come to check on you.   I will not be returning. I understand this isn't \"fine dining\" but after a long day when you just want a nice cold beer and some quick food, you also want quality or kind customer service."}
{"text":"ordered fried pickles there was so much grease on it when I emptied the container there must have been a quarter inch of Grease laying on the bottom obviously the bottom pickles we couldn't eat because they were so greasy the waiter came to take our order forgot two of our beverages forgot to to take one of the orders from the child's portion walks away forgets the napkins doesn't refill the beverages the guy's a goof.one of our parties ordered chicken salad.tge dressing saturated the salad."}
{"text":"First time at this Chili's. Arrived at 7 on a Monday eve. Place was half full but hostess said it would be a ten minute wait unless we sat in the bar.   We sat in the bar and asked our server about that policy. She said there were only four servers for the other area (15 tables) but that she was good and could handle this side by herself (12 tables). Still didn't get it but whatever.   We ordered an App to share: Texas cheese fries. They were good, with lots of cheese, bacon and green onions. Came with a ranch-type dip. My wife got the marguerita chicken and I got baby back ribs with original sauce.   The chicken was good. It was a big chicken breast, seasoned and covered with pico. Rice, tortilla strips and corn on the side. The ribs came with one side, so I got the SW Mac & Cheese, which had poblanos mixed in-tasty touch. The ribs were a bit dry but not too bad. Overall it was a fairly good meal.   I give this three stars for management's decision to have four servers cover 15 tables and poor Krystal covering 12 by herself. She did admirably but really people?  It was unnecessary."}
{"text":"I had not been to Chili's in awhile and found their new menu choices as well as the Free drink or chips and salsa for members fantastic! Currently, they have a terrific 3 for $10 offer which is a no-brainer when you can spend more than that at a cheesy fast food place. If you have not tried them lately check it out. Also, the To-Go service is wonderful!!"}
{"text":"We ordered. We ate. We tipped and than we dipped. Nothing more to say. This is a chillis in Tempe....good luck!"}
{"text":"Was not pleased at all. I first walked in the door and found trash all over the floor of the restaurant, it was 9pm so they where still open for an hour. Ended up standing at the host stand for about five minutes u til I finally said something to someone about seating us. Our server was fantastic. We asked to speak to the manager and he came out right away but seemed very frazzled. The Burger was nothing special. The blackberry tea was amazing though."}
{"text":"Awesome cinco de mayo dinner tonight outstanding food and the best server ever!Danielle was amazing! Sweet and fast even in a busy place. Food was excellent!"}
{"text":"We love the chips and salsa at Chilis. However the other food they serve has greatly gone downhill. My hubby ordered ribeye that was tough and thin. And I got soup and salad. The baked potato soup was more like cheese soup. So much so I ordered an enchilada soup. Not much better and the chicken tasted like pressed processed cubes in rather than real chicken. Both soups were gross to me. I enjoyed the salad. Our waiter was I believe the bartender.  He was super nice efficient and did a great job. Honestly we will go back for chips and salsa but we won't go back for the food:( I used to love Chilis but sadly they don't love serving quality anymore:(  I only have it two stars one for the chips and one for the waiter."}
{"text":"Our server, Amanda, was the best. Very clever, polite, and funny. My burger was great. The salmon wasn't so good, and the ribeye was horrible and a complete waste of money. Place was overall very clean and organized, and the music was great. I would come back here for for burgers and beer."}
{"text":"I have visited this place twice.it has very good food.i like flat pizzas here.for pure veggies the options are very very less."}
{"text":"We waited 45 minutes for a table. While we waited, we watched several tables go empty and not be bussed. Two tables, side by side, took 15 minutes to be cleared. As I sit here, we are waiting for our food which is taking way too long and my drink has gone dry...twice. While I eat here semi-often, I'll think again before coming again on a Saturday night. Very poor service and experience."}
{"text":"I like Chilis and the food never disappoints. The only reason why gave this branch 3 stars is the service. Our waitress must have been having a bad day because she was not too happy to serve us. Needless to say the service really hindered the chance for this Chilis to get a good review."}
{"text":"Thank you Mike bartender for being a gentlemen...and all the staff you always give a fabulous time and make me feel rockstar-ish...  See ya tonite!"}
{"text":"I have dined at this location many many times but our recent visit tonight has left us very disappointed. For starters there was a constant wait at the door for people waiting to be seated. Everyone was being told it would be a 15 minute wait, not sure why when majority of their tables were empty and prepped for diners..but yet they still continued to have people waiting at the door for extensive amounts of time. Our server was not friendly, food orders were messed up, chips were so salty they were inedible. This place has really gone down hill and its disappointing. In the past we would regularly see the manager ( gentleman ) walking around, greeting tables, checking up on everyone's experience... But there was nothing of this sort tonight. There was a huge disinterest by staff with I don't give a sh*t attitudes. Perhaps management has changed? Sadly we will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Where to start....1) we were sat by the bathroom where all you can smell is the urinal cakes. 2) our server seemed like he couldn't get rid of us fast enough, basically throwing things on the table as he ran by yo all his other tables. 3) our food was terrible and apparently they think more with less means you pay MORE for LESS food. 4) the automatic pay machine was a nice touch until it automatically suggested a 20% tip, not going to happen. 5) we won't be back the best part of the evening was leaving."}
{"text":"On a forced wait on a Saturday night. Empty and dirty tables everywhere but at 7pm, you must wait. No manager visible. Server is running for her life. Why wouldn't you staff your restaurant on a Saturday night? Seems odd."}
{"text":"Ok, so I just met my friend at Chili's for lunch to celebrate his birthday.  Let's forget for a minute that I drove to the wrong one (The one in Tempe that is now closed) and that he had to sit there by himself until I got there.  That's irrelevant.  We got there just before the lunch rush, and service was good.  One huge plus, my drink never got empty.  He was a little slow on removing the empty glasses, but it never got overwhelming.  I got a regular burger and fries.  The burger was so-so - it seems like they may have gone down in quality from the last time, the meat wasn't much better than a Whopper.  The fries were perfect, I love the seasoning they put on them, and they were nice and fresh.  The burger and bun never seemed to get along, and I ended up with a pile of soggy bun on my plate.   My friend got the chicken strips, and was satisfied, personally, I have never cared for the way they bread them there - too much like fish - I prefer more crispy chicken strips.  His corn on the cob was excellent - I actually kinda wanted to steal it from him, but it was his birthday.  Service got a little slow waiting for him to pick up the check and bring my change, but in their defense, the lunch rush was starting to peak.    Overall, it was a great meal for $25, and wow, is the tab less when there's no booze involved.  I hadn't tried this specific Chili's before, but it holds up the chains reputation well."}
{"text":"Haven't been here lately, but always pleasantly happy!  I ordered the quesadilla salad.  It was Big, tasty, and wonderful.  Our waiter, Frank Soooooo amazing!  He checked in is at least 5 times!  The best service!  Give him a raise!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. It does take a while for food to come out, so it's not the place to go if you're rushed. At least half an hour from sitting until you leave, if you eat fast.   Burger was a bit on the bland side for some. Patty was really charred. Fries were tough, dry and chewy. The bun was good; it held up and didn't fall apart."}
{"text":"Very good service. Had a problem with the sodas and they took care of it. Very clean and fast service. Had the $20 for 2 and it was more than expected."}
{"text":"Kelly did not take care of us whatsoever. She instead took care of a larger party for the bigger tip. She was MIA for an hour. Thankfully Steve tried to recover her forgetfulness. I will return as long as we do not have her again."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to eat if you want some quiet before going to the strip. I ordered the chipotle Chicken Fresh Mex Bowl and it was sooooo good. I shared it with my friend and without asking they split the portion for us! So thoughtful. Staff is great!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Customer service was excellent! Great environment! Oh and the food! Yum yum! & mixed drinks were made perfect!! We will definitely be returning! Thank you Allison for making our experience memorable!"}
{"text":"Always fast good food and the menu is amazing. Love coming here with my family. Convenient location and never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Low expectations were exceeded. I went with Mom thinking the food would be plastic but it was surprisingly flavorful. For Chili's, this location has dazzlingly yummy food. Service is friendly and attentive. It can be a little quiet on a weekday, discouraging for those that prefer more upbeat atmospheres, but the food is fun. Try the soups, quesadillas or sandwiches for great, quick bites.  Not for those seeking upscale dining or Friday night parties. It's just a Chili's, but it's a very good one."}
{"text":"I am completely OUTRAGED with the TERRIBLE customer service I received tonight, I don't think I have ever come across such poor quality customer, it was completely non existent! The bar tender NICK must be a racist, I waited at the bar 15 minutes to I finally had to get a manager involved and even then nick still never apologized or greeted me, then my food took an additional 37 minutes to arrive, all i ordered was the trio fajitas. This is my first time here at this location and it will be my last, i will be posting this review on Yelp as well. I'm completely disturbed"}
{"text":"It's Chili's.  Pretty standard for a chain.    Nothing stood out in my book.  Service was normal.  Love the new avocado burger tho."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with my parents. For the appetizer, we ordered the guacamole and chips. The guacamole was delicious! We ate everything! I had the 6 ounce sirloin with grilled avocado. It's off the \"Lighter Menu\" and is labeled at 410 calories. Impossible! It's too good to be 410 calories! My mom had the mango-chile tilapia and it looked delicious too! My steak was cooked to order. The service was OK, we had to ask for a drink refill. I'm going back tomorrow..."}
{"text":"Daughter and I decided to come here for a quick dinner. Ordered the mango chicken and it was not thoroughly cooked. The service was slow and I was just not very impressed with the replacement meal.  My daughter likes the idea of having the game console on the table, so that was the real draw.  I would not recommend this place for a meal (and it's a chain..... so you can only imagine)."}
{"text":"Always fresh!  Service is great!  Have never been disappointed!  Reasonably priced and a good variety."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and stopped by to catch Sun night football. Erica the bartender was very upbeat and friendly. Erica is the team captain for the St Jude's challenge and is very passionate about the charity. We were so impressed with her commitment to the Charity we donated what cash we had on us."}
{"text":"Best experience!!! Food was amazing and service was perfect! We got the 2 for $20 deal and sat in the bar. They were quick to serve us. My fiancé and I both got the classic sirloin and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Thank you as this was an easy and relaxing evening with no hiccups. Sean was a great server. Also happy to hear that the manager was helping out in the kitchen to make this a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Where am I? Las Vegas, Schaumburg, Napervhell? oops I meant Naperville, you get the picture.  You just got off a plane, and it's late, you're heading to your hotel and you're hungry. So you see a familiar sign and think, that will do. There was a wait, a bit more than we were told, but still in the it will take us more than that to go somewhere else range.  Service was friendly and relativity quick, my margarita was good, but not anything that would give you a buzz or anything. I was tired physically from a day of travel, but wanted something to numb the mind, it didn't do.   Everyone seemed happy with their food, I had some chicken tacos, they were better than expected.   Sure, I'd go back I wouldn't seek it out for a meal, and I'd skip the drink and get an iced tea."}
{"text":"The restaurant was packed and wait times were ranging from 20-30 minutes--not a huge deal considering we came during lunch; the problem I had was the number of times the staff complained about being busy. This wasn't your typical \"sorry we have big groups\" kind of  apologizing, rather it was \"I can't believe we have to serve all these people\" complaining they would typically be saved for their coworkers or friends."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here this afternoon.  I ordered the cajun chicken pasta which was great.   The bartender  Aaron was awesome.   Super friendly and accommodating.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow!!! So good and the people are super nice and happy to serve you mark was a vary good waiter I recommend him"}
{"text":"Lately I've been eating at Chili's a lot. Either to dine in our take out. I really enjoy their food and think the prices are fine. My favorite is their loaded mashed potatoes, one of the best I ever had! So creamy and full of flavors!!! Everything I've had here is good, salads, steaks, ribs. The only think I am not a big fan of is their chicken tenders, I feel like the batter has too much wheat. The service is normally pretty slow around here, it does not matter what time you go. In my last visit I was with a friend for lunch and we were kind of worried about taking too long since we had to go back to work. Then she had an idea of sitting at the bar and was a wonderful idea. They have a 3 for 10$ lunch special where you can get a non-alcoholic drink, an appetizer and an entree for 10$. I went with House salad, their sirloin with broccoli and loaded mashed potatoes, the food was really good! Our server (bartender) was very nice, even though she always alone at the bar at pretty busy time she did a good job. With that being said the only thing I believe they should improve is their service."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar with 2 friends of mine. I was helped by Jerry the bartender. He helped me, was attentive and really friendly. My recommendation: sit at the bar...."}
{"text":"I've somehow managed to avoid Chili's for the past 15 or so years. Friends have always had suggestions for me of new things to try on their menu, but I've never found anything there that I've enjoyed enough to want to go back.  If someone asked where we should go for dinner, Chili's was always the last place on my list.  Tonight I broke my 15 year streak and decided to give it another go.  Our server was super nice and attentive, bringing drink refills before we ran out.  She mixed our guacamole at the table and it was honestly some of the best I've ever had. (Yes, I know how crazy that sounds.)  Silly me, I guess I forgot I was in Chili's for a minute and mistakenly ordered the Cajun chicken pasta.  While the chicken was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of kick, a few bites of the pasta reminded me why you should never order pasta in a restaurant that isn't Italian.  Everyone else was happy with what they ordered and enjoyed their meals.    Overall, the service was top notch.  I suppose I could be convinced to head back, and it probably won't take another 15 years."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to eat here today. It's 48 mins away from where we live but since we were out that way and I never been to chilis we went. I have always seen the commercials on tv and the food looks good. And it was!! We started off with the nachos and the sauce we ordered with them was wonderful. My mom ordered the bacon ranch quesadilla. And I took a bite of that and it was soooo yummy! I ordered the bacon burger and loved it. I brought my leftovers home and when my boyfriend saw how big the burger was and how good it looked he wanted it. I let him taste it and he enjoyed it. Plus the waitress was so sweet! I def will be back here to eat some delicious food(:"}
{"text":"I walked in and ordered takeout at the bar.  It was awesome getting takeout that sat on the bar getting cold while I was waiting AT THE BAR, and then having to pay AFTER the food (that had been sitting on the bar) was handed to me, which took a long time.  I looove getting takeout and reheating it in my oven before I can eat it.   Oh and while I was there someone else was handed the wrong order.  That person had to come back...while the other party waited for their order to be remade.  Got to witness all of this as my order was made and then sat and sat and sat."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Chili's for years - the staff is always very friendly and the food is consistently good. My fav is the guiltless chicken sandwich.  I love wine, and recently they re-vamped their list which I'm really happy about. Try the ONEHOPE Sauvignon Blanc - it was great!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed. I usually order to-go. They never have my order ready when it should be. The portions are weak for the price paid and the quality is pretty poor. Asking for them to run coupons or discounts is like pulling teeth when you have to wait an extra 15 minutes while your food gets cold sitting there while someone locates a manager.   More distinctively remembered- the food was all carelessly thrown in cheap styrofoam containers that were melting from the heat of the hot food... the food that WAS hot until having to wait 15 minutes for a manager then the drive home. Applebees has legit quality plastic containers for to-go food. Why doesn't Chilis?? One thing I ordered was a side of grilled asparagus w/ Roma tomatoes & garlic. Sad presentation & portion for almost $10 of a charge! 4 weak, skinny, stringy strands of asparagus w/ 2 tiny bite-size cherry tomatoes and probably 10 pieces of garlic just thrown in a giant styrofoam container. I like garlic, but it was majority of garlic that I paid for. I could have gone & bought my own ingredients for half the cost of what this was.   I can't say anything else I ordered was worth it, either. It is like they bank on no one checking to-go orders before they carelessly throw tiny portions in crappy boxes. For the price paid, it was a ripoff and not worth it when it came to the quality of the food, either. And when you are offering coupons/discounts through email, those should be honored with no question, not having to make customers wait 15+ minutes to find a manager to approve what your company is marketing to begin with.   The least they did that was good was throw in an extra side of queso. Had it not been for that gesture, I probably would have left the food and asked for a refund. Please get your act together. I went to Applebees as an alternative and they blew Chilis out of the water with service, portions, quality & price."}
{"text":"Well, I can't say I will return to this location after my experience. Customer service & common etiquette seems to be a foreign subject to the employees here, especially the \"manager\"!   First- while the hostess taking my to-go order on the phone was very polite... she forgot to hang up. I thought what I had heard was her attempting to ask me one last question before I clicked \"end\" on my end... unfortunately, what I heard, was the hostess in full blown gossip session w/ another employee in a pretty horrid manner! Not only did they have NO problem speaking ill about several tables of patrons currently dining, in their requests for BASIC items entailed as part of the job for being wait staff, but the abundance of profanity & ugliness included in this bash-session left me hesitant to want to show up to pick up my food!   I understand I ordered late, but it was not close of business. I specifically asked when I called to order if it was still OK to place an order 1 hour before closing- they said \"of course!\"   There was no hostess @ the stand when I walked in (15 min later). The sign said \"please wait to be seated\". Well, I didn't need to be seated, it was a to-go order for pickup, but there was no sign directing to-go orders to a different location. As I stood there for 10 min waiting, I noticed the table that seemed busy, full right NEXT to the hostess stand was actually a table of 7 employees! Every one of them disregarded me as I stood there waiting, until FINALLY, 1 abruptly looks at me & barks, \"we aren't seating anyone now. If you need to pick something up, you SHOULD be at the bar!\" Wow... how the hell was I supposed to know that?! It was 9pm & half the tables were still occupied but there was no hostess to direct me!   The young lady @ the bar was nice enough. But, opening 1 box to \"verify\" the order was correct, when there was 3 boxes, total, was obvious she was preoccupied & didn't have the time to deal with my \"inconvenience\". She kind of made that clear when I went ahead to open the other 2 boxes & check while she ran my card... \"I JUST verified your order!\" Yeah, kind of... excuse me for wanting to make sure everything was there & accurate before I drove all the way back! And I kind of PAID for it to be accurate/verified.   So, I guess what topped it all off was the \"manager\" & entire way the staff @ this establishment reacts towards & treats their customers. I turned around to ask if I could give my phone # to collect the reward points on my account. I was abruptly told, \"too late, you already paid & the transaction is closed!\" Well, I just spent over $40 for dinner being brought back to some of us who are working double overtime & really just wanted a good bite to eat on a much needed break... it would have been nice to collect the points so the next time we could all enjoy free chips & salsa to share! i don't see why it would have been an issue to pull my account up & add the receipt confirmation for the points after just giving them decent business AND a tip even after the way I was acknowledged.   Turns out, the \"manager\" I was directed to speak with was one of the 7 employees camping @ the front entrance table who entirely disregarded me then proceeded to bark directions @ me when I first arrived. Do you assume he was much help?Why even bother to bring up the phone call malfunction, either?! Nevermind 3 stood blocking the walkway & did not budge as I tried to maneuver around them w/ bags of food in both hands attempting to exit.   I can't say I am eager to return to this location. I understand I came in close to the end of business. But there were still a good portion of other patrons just beginning to place their orders, dining in!   So I feel like it is piss poor customer service to expect patrons to automatically know they need to go to the bar for to-go orders after standing @ a vacant hostess stand w/ a sign that says \"please wait\" when you first walk in, & then having a table FULL of socializing employees entirely ignore you standing there until the \"manager\" decides to bark @ you to find the bar. And then you get criticized for checking the remainder of your order that was not verified beyond opening the first box, all while being denied points for the money you spent after having to also listen to employees bad-mouth other patrons in an explicit manner after initially placing your order.   Just, WOW. I worked as wait staff in customer service years ago. I'm not oblivious to the job. But I certainly would NOT have had a job had I practiced any of the antics I experienced this establishment's staff partake in this evening.   Applebees is just down the street... seems like they may be a better option next time around! At least until this location gets some etiquette training for their staff.   How I was made to feel upon arriving/exiting (the entire duration of being inside), before having even had the chance to eat any of the food, already left a sour taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Terrible experience here.We were the first customers in today,were greeted nicely but then it went down hill.Ordered a steak,asked for steak sauce but NEVER revived it, the smoked chiken was dry and burnt.The manager was \"in training\" and was nice.We will not be going back.only 1 star because I had to."}
{"text":"The food is the same old same old ....which is good , but this time the service has got a lot to be desired...s......l........o.......w"}
{"text":"Excellent food n services.  They give military personnel discount everyday n veterans day free food menu to the veteran.  Thanks for your support to all service personnel."}
{"text":"I like coming to this Chili's because I can always count on consistency with the food and service. I usually get an appetizer or a few different entrees which are specially good.  They have Happy hour from 3-7pm and 9pm to close Mon. - Thur. and there's quite a few options to choose from. As far as appetizers I like their Southwest chicken egg rolls and the spinach white queso with chips & salsa. You can't go wrong with their Fajitas (chicken, beef and shrimp)! I used to like their prime rib burrito but they took it off the menu : ( I'll still keep coming back because of the service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Terrible and horrible service. 1st time and the last time. Waited 15 minutes just to be seated with many open tables, waitress was dinky made my order wrong and took forever to bring out the food. Sucks when the people next to u ordered way after and they were done eating when we got our food. Got refilled on drinks 3 times and wow our food is out.never again-everybody should be fired"}
{"text":"I got carry out and it was terrible. Boneless Buffalo wings were all breaking no meat. I also got a buffalo chicken sandwich that had no buffalo sauce on it. Fries were cold and limpy. Nothing about this food was good quality. I have eaten at other locations and had a better experience"}
{"text":"Nice meal after a long plane ride. Picked up the family and stopped in for some dinner. We started with the triple dipper select your own three appetizer items and chose the cheddar bites, sliders and the crispy tenders. The appetizer comes with three sauces and was very tasty. For the meal we had sirloin with shrimp and asparagus, a burger and some chicken fingers. Everything went well and was a reasonably priced meal for the family."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in this place for the employees do not  know what the specials are. I called ahead of time and asked what time happy hour ended and a female told me at 6. I get here ten after 7 and HH ends at 7.  It's Thursday night, we are sitting in the bar area and I asked our sever if their was any drink specials. She said no. It's Thursday Margarita  $5 night. I ordered a beer and told the server about the Margarita special.  She did not know what I was talking about. If you work in the bar area, you should knw the drink  menu...."}
{"text":"I was in the Mandarin Oriental spa, and looked put the window and saw this place, and immediately wanted their chips and salsa.  Checked their app, and there was no wait, so I just headed over.  Whoever designed the Aria intersection with this place gets a big frown. Having to walk a block just to get across the street...  Anyway, this is supposed to be a review of this place, so. Walked in and was told it would be 5-10 minutes for a table unless I wanted to sit at the bar. I mentioned the app said no wait, but that I wanted a table.  I apparently pissed off the hosts in saying that, because ... I get seated right next to the kitchen, with plenty of other open tables in the place.  Danny, my waiter, comes over after 3ish minutes, and apologizes for not noticing me, because \"they usually don't sit people here\" (and he explained as I was paying that it's usually employee seating), which was obvious because it had a dried (salsa?) stain that took a lot of effort to clean.  Mmmhmm. Also as I was paying, he said two of the hosts were new. In my opinion, the third, who set a bad example to the other two, at minimum shouldn't be training, and really deserves to be told to work elsewhere.  The only other very minor thing was that the chips looked slightly overcooked.  Otherwise, the quesadilla explosion salad was very good, and Danny kept my drink filled.  Full marks for Danny, who rescued a visit that started off badly."}
{"text":"When there yesterday for lunch. After we ordered we looked around and just saw how filthy the place was. Looked like the floor had not been cleaned for a month. If we saw all this 1st I would have left before I ordered. We ended up having them box are meal when It came out and payed as fast as we could so we could get out of there. Food was not bad but I just cant take how dirty the place was. Will be my last time there. Another chain place going way down hill. Made me remember why we don't go to many chain chains anymore."}
{"text":"Located in D terminal. Has a limited Chili's menu which only includes, sandwiches, burgers and soups.  Service was quick and I was only slightly ripped off. Was expecting to pay more considering its located in an airport terminal!"}
{"text":"After our movie around 7:30, we decided to come here for a late meal.   We were seated immediately and glasses of water were provided. I ordered a cup of chili and a hamburger to take home for our animal sitting daughter, while my better half choose some ribs (photos).   Now our server Keith was wonderful. He checked-in on us along the way. There were a few miscues but nothing too serious. At one point the Manager came by to say \"hi\"and introduced herself. Very professional.   We found this all refreshing and appreciated the personal touch. We took advantage of Chili's $10 Off, when you spent $30 or more. They also are now giving Plenti Points.  Nice.   Expect to pay $15 each.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just left chilis in Scottsdale on shea blvd We had a fantastic waitress named Kelsey  She is very friendly and efficient. The the manager was very attentive as well I only gave 3 stars just because my chicken was cold. I opted not to get another one scared it may go in a microwave. Other than that all was fantastic"}
{"text":"Too many issues in one night to even begin listing at the Traders Points Indy location, will put all this on the manager which never walked around the restaurant asking how everything is, like in a good restaurant a manager is not afraid to find out. I will not be back to any Chilis & it takes a lot to happen before I would take it that far. Oh, even with as crappy as the night was I tipped over 20% & was alway pleasant to the server as I'm not sure the whole bad night was her fault."}
{"text":"The waitress here was absolutely friendly!  The food was delicious!  I would definitely come here again whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Went out an ordered a reg fajita entree (Which was excellent) but also tried the 2 for 20. Ok there is a reason it's 2 for 20. The sirloin was the itty bittiest piece of meat I have ever seen, and appeared to be half of anothe piece cut off.   Portion size was like a kids meal. Cut into it and it was super rare almost raw..Not just pink but still raw uncooked meat inside.  (Asked for medium well) They took it back, and said they would give us a new one cooked.   Um after we got it back some time later IT WAS THE SAME PIECE! not only that but the same vegetables on the plate now cold as ice! Can you say nasty, unhygienic, nevermind cheap??? GROSS! I can't believe this is ok  Jeez you would think they would at least give you a new piece or at the very least new vegetables that were now ice cold! Thank goodness we ordered the Fajita Trio!    Word to the wise, if you order 2 for 20 they will give you exactly what you pay for.....almost nothing.  Won't be going back to this location, but still like the Fajitas at least."}
{"text":"Any place that will serve me food after 11pm holds a special place in my heart, even if the service, or even the food, isn't spectacular.  The chips and salsa that they give you with your drinks are pretty clutch, everything else was lacking though. The fried corn guacamole was extremely bland, no salt, no spices, nothing. The loaded nachos were not loaded (this may have been because we requested no meat).  Something was not right about our waitress. She was either a stoic or just very, very high. But I'm sure she's a nice lady, probably just had a long day.  The bland food will not keep me away though since it is one of the few places that I will serve me food after 11pm."}
{"text":"Yuck!  I have no idea why people go to this icky, over priced chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and personable, food is on par with any other Chilis, but has a limited menu. Alcohol is pricey, but on par with any other airport restaurant. Not sure why everybody else gave such low reviews. Everything was as expected and service was prompt and correct."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter, and I went to the Arboretum location on New Years Eve because there was quite a long wait at another restaurant in the same shopping center.  I have eaten here before with my daughter, and was satisfied; however, it seemed to me that Chili's has undergone some sort of new gimic.  They are trying to be something they are not.  The first clue that things were going to be disappointing was the fact that the restaurant was practically empty on New Year's Eve!  Other clues, the waitresses were wearing some sort of black, beer t-shirts, and they had a mix of music - mostly 70-80's classic rock blaring in the restaurant.  I had to ask them to turn the volume down as we were there to have dinner, not dance! Lastly, the food was not served properly, and my meal (sirloin steak, mashed potatoes & salad) was not good at all.  The salad dressing was watered down, or some super cheap brand - no flavor, the steak had no flavor, and the potatoes lacked flavor, and were so hot (served in a cast iron skillet), that you couldn't eat them.  They also brought out my steak and told me that the rest wasn't ready yet, and they would bring it out when it was ready!  The \"rest\" was the potatoes that were tasteless and too hot to eat - overcooked! I sent the steak back and told them to serve it when they had my side item ready, as I was not interested in eating one item at a time.  They also did not serve any bread with the steak dinner.  Another disappointing issue with this restaurant was the fact that they had a very limited selection for wine, and they few options that were on the menu, didn't have any prices, so my husband was quite surprised when the bill arrived and my glass of wine cost $7!  IMHO, that is a pricey glass of wine for this type of restaurant.  Lastly, as we were eating our dinner, one of the kitchen staff came storming out of the kitchen area, slapping a towel against the walls, as he approached the manager/host, for some unknown reason!  Chili's needs to return to being a family friendly restaurant with a little class, a place where everyone in the family can find something to eat.  They are not a microbrewery, nor are they a sports bar, so they should not try to compete with those types of establishments.  Ultimate FAILURE!!"}
{"text":"Can't praise this location enough.   We purposely come at off times because we have twins in a stroller, and who wants to have a meal with two potential monsters (who have never acted up in public btw, but I have that fear).  They always seat us towards the front at a big table that has space next to it for the huge stroller where no one will be bothered by it or us.  The staff is ALWAYS friendly. They love to come by and peak at the boys or talk to them.  They accommodate my daughter's requests without giving attitude (some places that are family restaurants won't even acknowledge she is speaking to them and will only deal with parents).    The food is great, and when it isn't they make it great.  They really want to make the experience a good one.  **Tip to the mom's with kids out there, don't get the fajitas. One handed fajita eating is a pain in the backside, and the one time I ordered them with kids in tow was the one time one of them chose to need a bottle at the exact time the fajitas came out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"There really is nothing special about this place, but what are you expecting from a national chain restaurant... Predictable menu, predictable quality, not predictable service.  It might have been too many floor staff in training or just too many of them getting in the weeds without assistance from the managers.  Who knows, as we were trying to finish up and get out of there for a show, but when it takes 10 minutes to get a Togo container and your bill, and another 10 minutes to get your card processed and returned, there is not an explanation that I'm interested in hearing.  Set your expectations low and they will be met."}
{"text":"We stopped in at about 12:30 today hoping to get lunch. We stood at the host/hostess station for about 5 minutes while the on-duty host ignored us. He was busily conversing with a couple at a nearby booth and totally oblivious to the two couples waiting to be greeted and seated. We did what we always do in this situation; we turned around and walked out."}
{"text":"I will begin by saying, it is 2:37 and I am indefinitely stuck at work due to our bi-annual inventory.  Now this already makes me crabby, but as it got late the boss wants to buy everyone lunch.  Great!  Where?  I suggest Chinese...  Five minutes later he comes to me with a takeout menu for Chili's.  I guess I was vetoed by everyone else...    So I picked the spicy shrimp tacos.  It came with 2 sides, black beans and rice. The shrimp tacos were skimpy with the shrimp, and the spice level was more mild than spicy, but the shrimp was cooked ok and my stomach doesn't hurt, so they pass.  The beans and rice are another story.  Really bland, no flavor.  Oh well at least I didn't pay... Well back to work... this is the saddest part of my review..."}
{"text":"Don't go there on Friday night, especially if it is later like after 7:00.  The food was slow, cold & old. Yuck!  Waiters were nice but busy prepping for closing not sure."}
{"text":"Their food is good even though I'm not big fan of Chili's. We went there about couple hours later from lunch time, restaurant seemed busy at that moment, but service was great. We had a cute Asian server who has very nice smile on her face. She gave us the service we wanted."}
{"text":"We have this place a second shot. Last time we came it was absolutely terrible.   This time was leaps and bounds better. Staff were polite and friendly. It was clean. And the music wasn't to loud.   Bonus points to clean bathrooms! You would be amazed how many places song care about bathrooms. But that's for another Yelp!   Service was prompt and polite. Started with drinks.  Nothing fancy. Just two iced teas with no lemon. They were ok. A little watered down for my taste but not terrible.   I ordered the ranchero chicken tacos. The street beans were amazing. Cooked perfectly. The cilantro rice was on point too. Not dry at all. The tacos themselves were pretty good. A little salty. But the sauce and chicken were good.   Wife had the chipoltle chicken fresh mex bowl. She liked everything about it. No complaints at all from her. And she can be picky sometimes.   If they continue this way we will be back."}
{"text":"Food that's not even fit for a dog.  I set the bar very low when dining at Chili's and I'm never disappointed.  I ordered the steak fajitas which were served with the standard grilled steak , grilled peppers and onions. The flavor was what to be expected not spicy but charred however the steak was mangled as if a dog had first eaten off my plate and I was left with just scraps.  I don't even want to know who Chili's has working the grill...because I would just pity them, that they would even allow food to leave the kitchen that way."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about chilis, alcoholic drink seem to be more here than some other places and the service was slow. Our waitress was attentive and friendly but getting our food took lost than most.  However,  our food,  especially my enchiladas were delicious."}
{"text":"Great service from all staff. Our family favorite is the chicken enchilada soup. Normally go for takeout which is pretty quick for a restaurant. They also have parking for takeout and a separate entry."}
{"text":"We wanted to grab a bite to eat before heading to the airport, we saw plenty of our usual favorites and local pubs/bars/grills but we selected Chili's. Our server was on point, friendly and pleasant. The drinks  were strong/delicious, food was outstanding. We signed up for the rewards program and received a complimentary chips and salsa. Take it easy on the chips/salsa and save room for the food"}
{"text":"So I went to eat here tonight with my hubby and we got the 2 for $20. He got the chicken crispers with buffalo sauce & I got the chicken fajitas. Well when the food came I noticed that my chicken looked a little weird. As I cut into the chicken it didn't cut like normal chicken. I took a bit & it tasted spongy; the texture and taste were really gross. So I asked my husband about his chicken & he said it was also weird. Needless to say we both could not eat it. Now we have been to this chilies before & we always get some kind of chicken dish and we have never had this problem. I asked the server if they changed their chicken & she said no. But something was definitely off. Here's my tip to you, if you go here do not get anything with chicken breast. I'm not sure if they changed vendors or what, but the chicken has definitely changed."}
{"text":"I'm sitting at my booth now, but I had to take a moment to say how incredible the service has been so far.  I got a salad and forgot to say no onion, tomato or spring mix. The manager, Nathan, saw me picking it out, came over to offer to have them remake. It was my error and he was so intent on making sure we had our food and that we were happy. 10/10 will come back. The waitress is also incredible. Best chili's experience."}
{"text":"Although I am a fan of the food at Chili's (their all you can eat enchiladas is awesome), this post isn't a review of their food. Rather one about their staff. I lost my wallet on Friday and didn't realize it until late in the evening. I racked my brain and figured out had I accidentally left it at the Chili's in Henderson. I got there when then opened the next day and they still had my wallet. So, like I said, this review is a kudos to the awesome staff that found and held on to my wallet for me. :-) I'll keep coming back, just because of this reason."}
{"text":"Service was horrible we waited 1 hour to be sat on a thur at 5pm?? Food was not good, cold fries, burger was epicaly dry, just a bad expierience all together... will not be back to this location ever..."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. The portion size on the fajitas was fulfilling. However, the service was extremly slow and poor. The overall cleanliness of the restaurant was embarrassing."}
{"text":"This is a decent Chili's.  The food is good and is consistent.  Service is friendly, but variable in terms of speed.  The whole place is a bit dark and in need of serious freshening up - it's 1993 in here!"}
{"text":"Good ole chilay lay's, nicespot to checkout when you are near the outlets or the area. This spot gets crowded due to all the tourist traffic. Service is ok, staff are pretty friendly. Overall it's an average place to dine. If you subscribe to chili's rewards program you get points that add up to free goodies the more you visit. I scored a free dessert with my meal which was awesome."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place , lots of food, reasonable prices. This place can and will get packed to plan accordingly. I have been visiting this location for a  long while now. I always seem to get very good/ great service from the servers. The manager that works weekends is on top of his game. They got my order wrong , he promptly apologized and comped an appetizer for me and even took a discount on the bill. The menu offers a little something for everyone. Nothing too flashy but , great burgers and ribs, really like their cuts of steak. All in all a good place to dine for a good price ."}
{"text":"I'll be giving these location a 5 start but only because  we come here to see one person. Our server (Juan) is always great and on top of his orders. He is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and specials. Any other time we have dined in here with him not working we have always had a problem whether it was an order mistaken or our food being cold."}
{"text":"We had a great waitress, to bad the food just wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Arrived at 9:30 last Friday night. Walked in with party of 4 to an fairly empty dining room. Tables clean and ready for seating. Were told that it would be 20 to 30 minute wait. Because they were anticipating some large groups due to graduation. Another family said they had been there for close to an hour waiting to be seated. We all left to give some other business our money. This is not how to treat customers. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Literally stopped here cause it's Chilis. It's a cool place, it's pretty good, and we got off for the weekend so we thought it would be nice. This guy Dustin is the server and he's fabulous. Literally made us laugh, super high spirited, he's a great server and actually holds great conversations when you talk to him and he acts like he cared. He stopped by our table several times to make sure our meal was good, to make sure our drinks were full and he must be the best server I think I've had at a chilis in a long while. I love this guy and I'm coming back again in the future next time we walk the strip and we're requesting Dustin's table!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Always like to come in for the 2 for $22 deal and get the Margarita Grilled Chicken.  It's easy to get some lite and healthy fare that tasted great.  We always sit within the bar and receive prompt and fast service."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is slipping on cleanliness and overall quality. We used too always get a great meal in a clean and well maintained facility. The salsa was a watery mess, salad was rubbery, and even the chili wasn't much better than canned. Things have gotta get addressed by management or this place is doomed. Choose a different location for sure."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and we love this Chilis! Where we lived before, we had 3 Chilis' to choose from and never really enjoyed any over the other. It was refreshing to have quick service on a Friday night along with friendly servers!! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick late dinner before hitting the strip and had a good experience. This location is large with a fun, lively atmosphere and lots of tvs in the bar area. We were greeted and seated promptly by a friendly hostess and were happy to find our server was also very friendly and attentive. It didn't take long for us to get our appetizer or meals, despite a big crowd for the Knights game. Food was hot and tasted good, and the portions were large. We will return next time we're in the area for the attentive and friendly service, good food specials, and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We just ate at Chili's in the airport in Las Vegas.  Waited 23 minutes for the order to arrive.  Cheese burgers and fries.  Finally got the food.  The French fried were room temp and the cheese burger was room temp as well.  Waitress come back in five minutes to ask how it was and before we could answer took off.  Finally we stoped her to tell her about it.  She offered new fries.  Since I took two bites of the burger no offer to replace.  20% discount she did give.  Ordered tea with the meal.  OMG.  Failed to notice the price.  $3.99.  Asked for a lid and she said no because the airlines don't allow beverages to be taken onboard.  Well we work for a major carrier and always take a large tea aboard.  The waitress was also quite insulant.  Left her a .50 cent tip."}
{"text":"Went to eat today with my family and it was a bad experience.... app came out wrong so they took it back then brought the app and our food out together... my food was cold on top of that... so not worth the money that I payed..."}
{"text":"If you want to get told wait more than 3 times and your food comes out Luke warm while you watch other customers food come out with steam rising from their place then this is the place to be. I do not know my server's name and I told her my fries were not hot and the corn taste horrible."}
{"text":"I don't really like places like Chili's and Applebees (I think they are the same thing) but have gotten roped into going on several occasions.  I generally view their food as unhealthy and nothing special.  Lunch today was no exception and I would have liked to eat almost anywhere else.  Anyway, my employer was buying so what the heck.  Upon arriving I noticed that this had to be one of the nicest Chili's i have ever been to.  I must have been recently remodeled.  It was actually pretty nice!  Our party of 7 was seated promptly and the waiter was quick to take our order.  He was very friendly, quick, didn't make mistakes and most importantly was fast with my diet coke refills.  It was very good service considering the size of our party and it was the weekday  \"lunch rush\".  Here is my breakdown:  * Queso dip and chips - Of course my group had to order this because it was exactly what I needed....a yummy mess of cholesterol and calories.  Plus, I swear the stuff is addicting.  The chips are fresh and good and their salsa is also somehow very good and spicy.  * Chicken Fajitas - I thought this to be one of their healthier meal options so I decided to give it a try.  They were very good.  I didn't have the tortillas, guac or the sour cream, but it didn't matter.  The sauteed onions, peppers, chicken and whatever else were very good all on their own.  I licked my plate clean.  * Lava Cake topped with ice cream- Why do my coworkers do this to me?  I had a few bites and it was excellent.  I could have eaten the whole thing myself.  The same goes for that other dessert we got.  It was some ice cream over a brownie thing.  I can't believe I'm giving this place 4 stars but it really wasn't too bad.  I won't rush back but won't be opposed to going either."}
{"text":"The service was almost ok. The food was basic, nothing special. Nice TVs in the bar, not crowded and air conditioning wasn't too cold or too hot. I won't look forward to coming back unless it's for a drink only."}
{"text":"Delicious food + great staff = happy customer. I would definitely recommend this Chili's location to anyone in LV. This location is about 20 min from my house, but I have no problem traveling there just for the friendly staff. A+++++ from me!"}
{"text":"I want to hate you because you're a chain, but I have to adore you because of your tried and true familiarity. Bless you for having Southwestern Egg Rolls when I truly needed a snack to quell my wicked hangover before I took my 6 hour flight."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience tonight. The food took forever and when it came it was over cooked and not that great. Although they were busy, the staff did not work with a sense of urgency. I hate leaving bad reviews, but I thought it was a practical joke being played on my family and myself. I work in customer service industry and the customer service was horrible. I did however still leave the waitress a tip. She can only work as fast as her coworkers. I will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Waiting for a flight home, a friend and I had the pleasure of being welcomed and entertained by the bartender Mary. The cocktails were top notch, and we appreciated Mary's excellent customer service. Her personality and sense of humor is so welcoming and engaging we stayed for a second round... It's always a pleasure to have great interactions with people like her who understand true customer service- see you next time Mary!!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed with this chilis. We ordered takeout tonight and I paid extra for onion rings instead of fries, they gave me literally five onion rings with my burger and no ranch like I asked. The food was cold, too."}
{"text":"As my place of work is nearby, I often eat here after I get off. The wait staff is very nice and personable and I've only had one so-so experience. The food is cooked well, and the prices are good. I will continue to come here!"}
{"text":"Came by to get a nice meal on patio & enjoy the views of Tempe on a Friday Night. Tyler our server exceeded our expectations! Super attentive, amazing customer service and one of the best servers I've had! Thank you for a great meal & experience."}
{"text":"To tell you the truth this place is better than the locations I had seen around town and else where in the NorthEast like where I moved from Philly. I usually associate this place with overweight people with unhealthy food because my previous experiences here have been for drinks because of how close the location is to my previous work. Ps a BIG heads up about drinking here: because this is a \"family establishment\" the waiter wouldn't bring us more than 1 drink at a time. I know this because we tried to order 2 shots for my friend and the waiter refused. So what my friend had to do was take 1 shot and then less than 5 sec later order another one. I have to say, it is a great way to force drinks down people's throats. Anyways went here on a Friday afternoon for their lunch specials as per suggestion by a friend. 7-8$ gets you an appetizer and a small lunch entree. I got the carnitas tacos with a side of tortilla soup. My friend got the taco bowl with tortilla soup. We both got the soup because the waiter suggested it. Truthfully the soup was ok. Kinda salty and bland at the same time. Like the broth was salty but it had no other taste. I had to ask for extra tortilla for some extra crunch and a side of pico de gallo to make it edible. As for the tacos, the carnitas were bland as well and it came with a side of fries. The fries were soggy and not tasty.  I have to say though the clientele was more healthy then I was accustomed to in the past and it looks like they have increased their health factor in their entrees. Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have gone to this location with my friend for lunch for many years now and have received  excellent service. You cannot  beat the prices of lunch here as I've almost always order the chicken fajita with either a bowl of soup or salad. We can both order these and the bill is still under $20! The quesadillas are excellent and chips and salsa are as well. Their bar has a nice setup of booths and high tables as well as a round bar with multiple televisions. Definitely try this spot for a cheap lunch near the LV blvd and I-15 or I-215"}
{"text":"This chain is located in the newer Arroyo Plaza right off 215 West in between Buffalo and Rainbow and is very convenient for those who are on the southwest side of town who want a reasonably priced meal. I enjoy going in here and sitting at the bar when there is a basketball or football game that I want to catch.  I'd normally come in with 1 other friend or by myself at the spur of the moment, whenever I need my fajita fix from massive hunger! Whenever I come in with a friend, we happen to go in when drinks are 2 for 1 (I'm not sure what day or time the happy hour runs).  I like the complementary chips and salsa  I usually get at the bar as well."}
{"text":"They were very busy, but most places in this area are on Friday night. The waitress made sure are drinks were filled and was very pleasant. Food did take some time to come out, So if you are in a hurry you might want to go to another area or order the car-side to go. The food was good and the waitress made sure the steak was cooked right before leaving. Much happier with this chilis than the one by metro."}
{"text":"Sat for ten minutes without any serving staff coming to the table. Decided to leave and check out another place."}
{"text":"I like coming for happy hour all day Sundays.  Today I got the southwest egg rolls and the chips and salsa.  Debated on a drink but skipped the alcohol and stuck with my pop.  I always eat at the bar because you don't have to wait to be seated, there is always someone at the bar,  it's always clean.    Sign up for the plenty rewards and earn coupons and rewards!"}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a month. The service is consistently excellent. Atmosphere is casual and comfortable.  The food isn't outstanding but it is okay. The fries are my least favorite and the item I have complained most about so now I just avoid them. They taste old. Like they have been under a warmer for hours, limp and  tasteless. Warm, not hot. The onion rings have no salt or flavor. The salads are a very generous portion and fresh.  I really like the black bean burgers and southwest egg rolls.Margaritas are good.  I do recommend this place for a nice meal without being fancy."}
{"text":"ICK. Was just a horrible experience. Went there for lunch on Saturday. OMG, food was horrible. I ordered chicken nachos...They were ok and then I realized the chicken inside was not all the way cooked. Stopped eating them. I then had the penne pasta and it was absolutely bland. No taste. I was so disappointed. My husbands burger was not cooked correctly. It was just an all around disaster. I did tell the staff and left a review on their kiosk. I was sent a buy one entree and get a free appetizer. Hahahaha, really? I spent $53.00 on a horrible meal and they want me to to back to get a free appetizer? Shaking my head."}
{"text":"It's Chillis. Love the chicken enchilada soup. As of late I've been enjoying the Tex-Mex menu. Otherwise I generally get the appetizer sampler as my entree. I've never received terrible service at this location. They're never packed either. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Meh. Average. I came here a few times and each time I got the bacon ranch quesidillas. I will the say the food was consistent. However, even tho the menu says it the quesadillas come with Pico and sour cream, mine didn't. Then I  was charged 80 cents more for each when I asked. Also, the staff didn't seem very happy to be there. I sat in the bar area both times. The waitress was very short, darting off almost before I finished talking. The price was decent, 10 dollars for chips, quesadillas, salad, French fries and an iced tea."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh what to say about this chili's first off the only good that came out of here was my sons meal that they brought out when it was hot. Service was slow but it was dinner so that was understandable but the food was unacceptable. All 5 of our meals were cold. My steak was raw and chewy as I asked for medium well. My sister-in-laws tacos were cold as well as her boyfriends. My husbands burger was cold and my mother-in-laws skillet... Her skillet! Was cold it's a skillet! Was suppose to be hot! Oh and her tortillas were cold and they were in the box that kept them warm. It took them 45 mins for the food and the manager didn't even look sorry. I took enough classes in culinary and sanitation to know that was amateur. Maybe they should make them take classes or at least have some knowledge of cooking and temperature danger zones. Worst service ever."}
{"text":"Goo atmosphere. Not a place for watching sports due to the increased noise from the restaraunt. Beer is perfect temp and the bar tender is amazing! Not ordering food because I came to drink."}
{"text":"I love Chilis so in my heart of hearts I can't give them less than 2 stars but our experience was AWFUL!   No one standing the hostess stand. We waited for a few minutes before someone emerged from the kitchen and approached us with a \"How many?\" No I'm sorry for the wait, How are you this evening... Nothing just How many? We stated we had two and she said \"lounge or restaurant?\" We looked kinda confused and simply stated , \"we would like a booth.\" She points to a booth in the bar and we said that table is dirty. She grabbed menus and started to walk away... She didn't state, \"Follow me, This way.\" Again nothing. It was actually quite rude. She takes us to a small booth in the dining room area and before we can even sit down the server who's section we were apparently being said in says, \"IM CUT!\". What a unprofessional way of handling that situation. Right in front of guest saying you are cut. Makes them feel extremely unwelcome or like a nuisance. I work in the service industry and would never say I'm cut in front of a table. You handle any of that behind the scene. Then it took forever for someone to come to the table and guess who greets us? The server that was so called cut, I'll call her server 1! She greets us and because it had been so long we gave our whole order then.   After awhile another server comes up to us, she was super nice and I believe they were team serving, I'm gonna call her server 2. Server 1 then comes back and says, \"You don't have your chips and salsa? I'm going to kill her!\" and walks off. Again SO unprofessional! Once they brought out the chips I asked to have my cup of soup. They brought my dates soup. Then return to get my cup of soup and bring the wrong soup out! At this point I'm trying to be patient but are you even looking at my ticket in the kitchen? There are seat number and an order with all my information on it. Well needless to say the rest of our hot food order arrived before my simple cup of soup. I'll say I know how Chilis works because I use to work for them so like most restaurants the soups are made and kept in soup wells and servers are responsible for \"prepping them\".   Moving on to the main order.. Which wasn't right. I definitely made changes to the Quesadilla Explosion salad but I always do. I asked for a different chicken on my salad and extra dressing on the side. My salad came out dry with all dressing on the side so I did have to ask for extra dressing again which is something super small that would normally not iterated me but after everything else going wrong I was pissed.   I ask for a box for the rest of my salad and some Togo dressing. This takes forever from server 2 and for some reason she brought a bag and then went to get dressing, consolidate your steps is like day one of serving!   Side note: server 2 was extremely nice and at least acknowledged how awful our experience was and apologized for the mistakes.   We never had a manager touch our table. If we had the. We most definitely would have explained what had happened. Again I really hate to rate them low because I love Chilis. It was my first job and I worked as a hostess and a server so I do know how the system is suppose to work. I would have been completely embarrassed if this was an experience that I had delivered.   Side note: This isn't the first bad experience I have had at this location. I have ordered take out and gotten home to find that my whole order was wrong. They really could use some work!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience, as is most of the times we get To Go.  We get Chili's To Go almost weekly, and 8 out of 10 times there is a problem. First, the salad that came with my Pick 3 was half size.  I was told that it was the correct size, even though the three previous times I ordered the same meal, it came with a full sized salad.  When I asked about this, the server, Hannah, gave me a blank stare.  She asked if I wanted to talk to the manager, and I said \"sure\".   Apparently she didn't hear me, because she just rang up my order.  I felt the temperature on one of my meals and it was cold to lukewarm. I asked what time it had come out, because I was there right at the time I requested the food to be ready. Hannah said that she just brought it out.  I said, \"well, it's cold\". Again, blank stare from Hannah. Finally Hannah asked if I wanted utensils. I said, \"No thanks.\"  She then put utensils in the bag.  All I can say about this visit is....I think I'll take my business to TGI Fridays."}
{"text":"This Chilis in my opinion is the best one in the valley. The food is always good and the service is attentive. I do prefer sitting in the dining room over the bar with a family. The servers get to busy in the bar but that is expected. Been to Chilis 100's of times and I will continue to go to this one."}
{"text":"Ok. Well when you go into a Chilis on a Saturday at 6:00pm and there is no wait that is red flag. The food was ok and the wait staff was pleasant. But the GM has to be the most unpleasant and miserable person in the food industry. Maybe he just can't talk cause he never said on word to us even though he was working the host stand. Food was typical Chilis. I would go back but it was not that memorable."}
{"text":"Been to this Chilis many many of times. I figured it was time for a small review. Nothing bad to say. Restrooms could use a little bit of attention but other than that I would say this long standing Chilis is still doing a great job. The staff is very polite and from what I could see the dining area is very clean."}
{"text":"Good size margaritas with plenty of alcohol for $3.99 during happy hour!!! Doesn't get better than that..."}
{"text":"I have to say as far as chain restaurants go I've been pretty happy w Chili's.  I go for lunch at least once a week and have never had a problem with bad service.    I also LOVE that they don't allow children in the bar area, and don't allow smoking either.  The menu is typical American fare and the prices are decent.  All in all, can't complain."}
{"text":"Totally deserved 5 stars! I had a horrible experience @ Surprise location & was hesitant to come here but gave it a shot. From the start staff was courteous, prompt & helpful. I took my son & his buddy for dinner before their buddy prom & the staff was very alert to the fact that they were dressed up. They were understanding of our rush & gave good suggestions. Food was prepped as requested & all tasted great! Manager came to table & we had a great chat. If I ever want that Santa Fe salad I will drive to this location! Thank you for changing my mind about Chilis!"}
{"text":"Never received our food. Worst ever. Do not waste your time as they wasted mine! Not worth a star. Attempted to place an online order twice it did not go through so I called this location nearest to my home. She tool my order said it would be ready in 10 min. I get there and stand in front. 4 employees see me and turn away. No one acknowledged me. I walk around the bar slowly to find another register on the side for on the go orders. There's a female staff member there. As I walk over she walks away. The bartender doesn't acknowledge me & clearly I'm lost. I wait 3 more minutes it's now 15 minutes after I placed order. An employee sees me! She tells me I need to go to the bar to pick up my order. Great. I sit myself at the bar and wait for the bartender to be told that I'm picking up an order to which she finally walks my way and says oh hi how can I help you. ? Really. She then looks into the magical computer & sees there are no pick up orders. Grand. She asks me to wait (cause apparently it's what customers do best) she walks back to the other girl who tells her she remembered putting the order in but - wow - it's not in her magical computer either! She walked over to tell me this and after a moment of staring at me asks if I \"want them to put the order back in?\" I asked for the manager (Jimmy) who took 2 more minutes of my time and then came over. Gave a generic apology and I then wasted his time explaining what transpired. Regional manager will get a call. Chilis will get an email & Special Olympic fundraiser will not get their 15%. 15 minutes wasted. Hungry kid. Good night."}
{"text":"Food is the same found at any Chili's; however the service was seriously lacking.  We waited 20 minutes for our food to arrive and my wife got her salad at the same time as the main entree...poor form.  In addition, we order kid's meals at the beginning of our order; which come with a drink, but the drinks were not delivered until the main meal and they were 2/3 of the way full AND each time the waitress got refills on these (two other times), they were always delivered 2/3 of the way full...I thought it really strange why the waitress did not take the extra initiative to fill the drinks the entire way on a dinky little child size cup.  And to make matters worse, the entire electronic pay processing devices were not working and our only form of payment was a Chili's gift card; which could not be read.  As a result, we had to wait \"10\" minutes to pay the check; while the manager calls and gets verification of funds and so forth and so forth.  It wasn't a great visit in terms of time and waiting.  Hopefully this Chili's gets their act together for the future, because your customers will not want to come back otherwise.  Oh and by the way...you can forget the parking, because there is none!  I spent 10 minutes going from business to business looking for a place to park (i.e. Travelodge, Polo Towers, etc.) and there is absolutely not a single place to park for free).  We just drove to our hotel (the Cosmopolitan) and walked over."}
{"text":"Well today's my birthday & I received a gift card or I else I don't think I would've gone in the first place. Not even 15 min after leaving I start throwing up. My fiancé is also sick. Not to mention we waited forever for our food. A family of 5 received their food before we did & they were seated about 10 min after us. The service sucked & they over charged us. It took about an hour to get our entrees. Our stomachs are killling right now. Save yourself."}
{"text":"The server was nice but the service was very slow and disorganized . She really seemed to be overworked and exhausted. At the end of our meal she actually apologized and explained how she had been there way longer than she should have been. I ate there with my wife and three children. They brought the food out for four of us but then forgot about my sons meal. When she finally came back about 10 minutes later we ask her about it and she acted completely confused as if she had no idea he did not get his food. Then about 10 minutes later his food showed up. Drink refills were tough to get. I ordered another beer through the tablet on the table and it never came until I ask for it. Food was fine. The server did give is my sons meal for free but made it very clear that she had to pay for it out of her own paycheck. I told her that was not necessary but she did it anyway."}
{"text":"There are places happy with their happy hour... Proud locales that promote it, advertise it, offer it & bask on it... This Chili's is not one of them :/ and that is sad, because they do have great maragaritas - in my personal opinion. That's why I end up there at least 3 Tuesday's of the month. It was almost becoming a tradition for me because of a nearby meeting I attend in the area. But that's definitely now out of the window. I got tired of Chilis trying to chill their way out of their own Happy Hour. The first Tuesday I went there we learned it was happy hour only after we paid the bill... Which never leaves you a good feeling. But what happened yesterday was even more fustrating. We purposedly asked to be sat at the bar, BECAUSE of the Happy Hour & stayed on a cramped table at the bar BECAUSE of the happy hour (since you can only get it from that one area) and ordered from the happy hour menu, pointing from the specific items in the menu, and yet when they bill came they tried to play silly and charge the items at full price!! The one person that seemed to be a manager, not only needed an explanation as to why we were asking for the happy hour pricing but, then proceeded with the old excuse that the waitress didn't know any better :/ Nothing worse that end the night by trying to explain ourselves and have something corrected that shouldn't need any correction, excuses, or clarification. If they don't want people to order from happy hour they should not offer it. This is a trusted, major brand and from all the places this is not the one you'd expect this. It leaves a sour note to a night that was going so well. I don't go to places for happy hour with the purpose to end up not happy, so my personal resolution to this is no more happy hour at Chilli's. Moving on to the YardHouse. That's our plan, and we're sticking to it, but anyone reading this, your resolution should be to check your bill. Chili's wants its full price and they're not afraid to try."}
{"text":"The service is usually great. I have sent food back for various reasons, but they usually make it good."}
{"text":"Came here a few times on lunch break. Service was always slow and business was not busy at all. Food was good but it always took a while. There was never a check back or refills done even with different servers.  For a slow place service should of been on point."}
{"text":"I love chilis when I'm in the mood for fajitas or queso but the service here is consistently mediocre or bad.. Always forgetting to refill drinks, drinks taking a long time, forgetting side requests or plates, waiting too long to come back and check on us."}
{"text":"This by far has to be my favorite Chili's in the whole Vegas valley!! The food by far is absolutely always amazing and the staff is always helpful and so very Pleasant!! Tonight or (waitress) Jordan and (manager) Trip made it extra special with there Top Notch service!! Thank you both again so much for a wonderful meal and experience. We truly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This is my go to when I don't feel like driving too far to eat. The service is great. I like the ziosk kiosk on the table. You can pay the check at the table and don't have to wait for the server to bring it. I've pretty much liked everything I've had here. The skillet mashed potatoes are awesome. I'm a little disappointed because they don't offer the pork carnitas tacos anymore. They were a gluten free item with corn tortillas but they don't offer them anymore. The ribs are good. Although, last time I had the ribs with honey chipotle sauce. I could hardly taste the sauce and the ribs were a little dry, which was a first for me bc they're ribs are usually juicy."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad but the waitress wasn't good. She forgot my daughters juice we ordered with the kids meal and her utensils. We didn't get a sauce on the side we ordered. Also she didn't bring us a bag to put all our to go boxes in when we were done and there were a lot of to go boxes so it was difficult to take them out. On the way out we had to ask for one cause one was popping open and about to fall. She then asked us to do a review of her saying she was great at her job so she can get more tables but the place wasn't busy and she already wasn't doing too good.  -UPDATE we went back and the same chick forgot the drink with the kids meal again..."}
{"text":"This Chilis is very busy during lunch. They always try really hard with in store & carry-out orders. Sometimes they make mistakes but it's okay."}
{"text":"This is the closest place to my office that has soup, so for the last 4 weeks while I have had a cold that I cannot get rid of, we went back to this Chili's for soup and liquor for lunch.  A little over a year ago, I vowed to never return, but they seem to have gotten their shit together and we actually went enough over the past few weeks that the wait staff in the bar area of seating recognizes us when we come in (we're awfully cute and personable, plus good tippers - so I understand why we are memorable).  They have a revamped menu and while a lot of the old standards are there, they have some new items too.  I *really* like the option to turn any burger into a turkey burger (or veggie, or 2 thin beef patties) and had that twice last week.  The potato soup was very good and my BFF was living on their chicken enchilada soup while she was sick and she said that was very good too.   I have to absolutely commend the daytime bar-area wait staff.  I think the one gentleman's name is Adam, who has been there forever and has always been a shining star, and there is also a woman working in that area (can't remember her name - ugh) and they are rock stars.  Drinks never go empty, plates are cleared, sweeteners are brought, etc.  Seriously - they are amazing and should be given gold stars or raises or whatever it is that Chili does.  The food has improved drastically, but the wait staff that can get us fed and back to work in time is what is keeping us coming there.    Great job by this Chili's to turn it around.  It's verging on a 4-star review for me, keep it up!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants and I've not been to Chilli's in years, but I went with friends and the food was better than expected.  First, Chilli's has gone through a makeover, they offer better food than I ever remember. Their menu is more creative and their recipes have improved.   I was impressed by their veggie options and the service was excellent. I've got to say I walked away impressed. I'm still picking local most times, but here's where to go in a pinch."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful Friday at 11:30 am and I decided to stop for a quick lunch with my very young daughter after feeding the ducks at the Anthem park. We walked in and the hostess said it would be a 15 minute wait (I should have left) . I looked and saw a bar booth open with a pile of glasses, napkins and plates so I asked if we could eat in the bar area. She said sure, but it's going to take just as long to get food. We sat down and after 10 minutes they finally cleared the table. After what felt like eternity we got our food. The table next to us waited even longer and they had to send their chicken sandwich back. They are severely under staffed. The two bartenders that were serving the bar section were very nice so it's not their fault. This chilis is poorly managed. The food is just okay and the staffing is terrible. You are better off driving down to happy valley and eating at one of the great places there."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for years and they have a lot of staff who have been there for while. Its nice to see that. Some staff in particular are absolutely amazing people, very kind, very attentive, just awesome. The managers are very cool, the drinks are good. I just love it!!! My husband and I would rather go to chilis because we are guaranteed a great experience and good food EVERY time then go somehwere higher end and be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place service is a little slow but I love their work lunch menu! Super affordable and yummy"}
{"text":"I came here with my mom and my brother. The  restaurant  was about  half full  for lunch. The service  was excellent.  I had chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli  (the broccoli  could have been cooked a little  longer), but other than that the meal was excellent.  The waitress was very nice and was on top of everything."}
{"text":"Terrible service tonight. We ordered an appetizer of chips and salsa and 20 min later asked the waitress where it was.. Her reply was \"the kitchen is really busy tonight but I will see if it's ready.\" Didn't realize  ypu had to cook chips and salsa.. Then dinner came another 15-20 min later and waitress left us sitting with no silverware or napkins till she resurfaced and we asked for them. Then my husband ordered the ribs and  potato wedges.. They brought the ribs and said the wedges would be right out.. 10 min later he got his side... Dumb who brings 1/2 a dinner to the  table?"}
{"text":"Torn between 3 and 4 stars.  I can say the food here is always good - nothing upscale but there's a nice variety of choices and everything I've had is usually pretty good.  Its certainly much better than Applebees (don't get me started on them).  However, what I've noticed with this location is your satisfaction will depend largely on your server.  A recent time I'm pretty sure our server was stoned - at least I hope he was - because he got literally EVERY SINGLE thing wrong - right down to giving us the wrong check.  Got the appetizer wrong, got both entrees wrong (one in 3 different ways), overcharged for one entree even though I held up the menu and pointed to what I wanted (could I have made it any simpler?), and gave us the check for the table next to us - who had left 20 mins prior and was 40% higher than ours.  I'm a pretty patient person, but seriously, how many mistakes can 1 server make on a single table?  And the glassy eyes - maybe it was an Rx that caused him to be so off but I don't think he was all there.  Yesterday I ordered a plain med-well hamburger.  After 40+ mins I got a cold med-rare cheeseburger ... again ... how much simpler could I have made it?  I don't really blame the server here - but how it took 40 mins to get a cold burger, I'll never know.  The 2 best servers are Norman (usually works the bar but I haven't seen him lately) and Erika (little blonde always charging around like shes on a mission) - they have never done me wrong.  The guy who wears the NY Giants lanyard isn't half bad, except for the obvious flaw of being a Giants fan.    I'll return as overall its a decent place but sometimes I leave in a bad mood and I really wish that wouldn't happen."}
{"text":"Will not be going back to Chili's. Their chips are super greasy, even when you ask for a different batch. The quality of food has gone downhill and does not taste as good as it used to. The plates come out with the sloppily placed on it. Service has gone downhill also."}
{"text":"I went to Chili's today for an early Mother's Day dinner and was pleasantly surprised by the promptness of the service.  They have a great menu; however, we haven't been to this one in Las Vegas but used to go back home.  The food was pretty good and but the service was on point.  Our server was very attentive.  I enjoy this location."}
{"text":"First time to Chili's and I will be back for their afternoon lunches. Great to relax and take a break from an all morning conference with a margarita for $5 dollars and one of their sandwiches. The menu is pretty extensive when it comes to lunch.  Staff is friendly and quick when it comes to bringing your drinks and meals. They probably get patrons from all the surrounding hotels for lunch and dinner too.  The food is good, reasonable prices and the drinks are awesome.  Really like their gadget-tablet at every table where you just swipe your credit card, sign and go. No need to get the check from the waitstaff. Eat and run out with the check all processed. Now, how cool is that. Have not tried the games on the tablet yet."}
{"text":"Worst service and breakfast. People that came in after us got served their food before our food! Buttermilk pancakes were rubbery; bacon was chewy--not crispy. Tasted like it was prepared elsewhere and then reheated In the microwave. I asked our waitress if their food is prepared fresh and she replied yes it is on the griddle. I doubt it! I'll never give them my business again! If you don't believe me--try them yourselves."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best. I mean, I didn't find any bugs in my food or anything like that, but in this day and age with there being so much competition, you would think this place would step it up!  My family and I ate here for lunch on a weekday. The service was okay. I think the inside of the restaurant is very colorful and exciting, which is the exact opposite of their food.  We got the lunch specials. The pictures of the food were approximately 10 times better than the actual real food. The loaded potato soup was just okay. The chili was a little bit better. I did like that they had five soups available that day, but what about having just one or two soups that are out of this world?  I ordered the chicken fajita lunch special, which was $8. I added rice for an extra dollar. This really wasn't that good. I would have rather gone to a local taco shop than eat this; better yet, Chipotle would have been waaaay better.  Anyway, my family was not really satisfied with their meals either. We all regret going there. Maybe they have better food at dinner time, but I'll never know because I refuse to come back."}
{"text":"Placed an order online, arrived 10 min after we were supposed to, and Bill said \"Ummm...we don't have part of your order.\" I responded, why didn't you call and let us know 30 minutes ago? \"I was busy...\" Nice job chili's. Waste of 40 minutes waiting and 40 minutes round trip. Bill being busy shuts the entire operation down apparently?."}
{"text":"The craziness of the location probably hindered the service a little bit but I can certainly understand that. Overall the servers were very attentive and the bartender made amazing drinks!  Their everyday happy hour is amazing! 2-4-1 on a large selection of drinks made it well worth while! Plus the entree deal 2/$20 with sirloin on the menu was amazing to offer! I'll definitely take advantage of this again! And the fried pickles were to die for! Best place so far for these.   I'll be back but probably a less \"touristy\"/crazy location!"}
{"text":"The girls in the front are alright. Mainly just stand around and don't do much. We had to wait for about 20 minutes to get sat for a table of 5. Not too bad! I had the cajun chicken pasta. It's my favorite thing here! Now that's all I get no matter which location I go to haha. Make sure you get the loaded boneless wings. They're so good! This location is a little smaller than most I have seen but it's right off Durango and Charleston! Right across the street from boca park. Brandon is a very great server! He was great at recommending things, remained patient when we all didn't know what we wanted, and checked up on us a few times."}
{"text":"I've been to this location one time. I always get the Cajun chicken pasta. It's so good every single time. The plate is huge too. The loaded boneless wings appetizer is literally worth coming for, even if you aren't hungry. It's so good. The chicken is so crunchy and there's so much cheese on top of it. The molten chocolate cake honestly looks better than it is. Now for the service, their service at this location isn't that great. I'd rate it a 6.5/10. I'd come back though. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Staff: Good service, the waitress was friendly and attentive, it took a little while though to get our food.  Place:  No ambience , no personality almost depressing .  I ordered: - the Grilled Steak, Pork Carnitas & Shrimp fajitas trio with rice and beans ( not bad not good just average) - Corona beer - strawberry lemonade cocktail ( too sweet) - cinnamon skillet roll (not good , super dry tasted like dry bread )  I was of course expecting that from a chain, so no gourmet request or complaint here $50 ++ for that type of food and ambiance is a little bit pricey...."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, and as usual everything was wonderful. Our waitress Liza was so attentive, and we will request her from here on out. Appetizer, food, and dessert all came in a timely manner. My steak was cooked perfect, and my triple berry margarita was delicious as always!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning with Chris and Rhonda at Calgary Airport.   We all had the regular breakfast food, eggs, sausage, omelette's and toast. It was nice, quick and reasonably priced. Server Shawna was outstanding !!"}
{"text":"Very good service.nice and friendly servers.steak and waffles with chicken was delicious and big portions.red chips with salsa souse was wonderful .good atmosphere.I enjoyed."}
{"text":"Went to the Chili's on Dobson road now that the Mill Avenues Chili's is closed down.  In comparison it was totally disappointing.   Ordered the Classic Sirloin, as the photo on the menu not only made it look tasty but large.. (Great Photography)   My classic sirloin I did NOT take one bite out of!  it was not only smaller than you can believe it was most unappealing in look.  what was brought to the table was nothing more than bait and switch in comparison to the photos on the menu..  Lastly having 5 people at the table with us, the discussion about the food brought us to one conclusion, this has to be what food in a nursing home tastes like !"}
{"text":"I looked so forward to going to the newest chilis.  I will not be going back in the next decade.  Or edged appetizers and a meal, did not finish any of them.   Fries that were the consistency of mashed potatoes and employees who didn't care.   To sum it up YUC"}
{"text":"My bestfriend and I visited this location June 3, 2016... Now, we eat chilis on a regular and I'm telling you I ordered chicken crispers, loaded mashed potatoes, and steamed broccoli, my mashed potatoes, loaded at that came back with just the cheese on top not melted at all and they were cold I sent them back and asked for another one. Instead, hot mashed potatoes with no cheese the manager brought more mashed potatoes, he did not apologize didn't show any concern didn't really care I work in the food industry so I understand and if I see any of my servers giving bad customer service as the manager was then I definitely would advise them to find a new career path the manager  Dewayne at the university location should definitely think of a new career path because I dont think this is what he wants to do anymore.   Now the best part of my visit was Bola is a great server very great customer service he served us very well  Lindsey the manager that was at the host stand gave us very great customer she made us feel sooooo welcomed I commend her on that!"}
{"text":"I literally had to sleep on this review before I wrote it lol, I went there last night with my son and boyfriend and I think it may have been the worst service I've received in a long time ....  For starters we walk in and wait to be seated.. the guests before us were asked by the hostess if they would like a booth or a table, after choosing they were seated. We were not asked just seated at a table and then she left, our server came around and we had to ask him if we could have a booth. He tells us we had to wait for one to be available, which was odd because I could see at least 3-4 booths empty and appeared to be clean... but what do I know, maybe they were secretly dirty lol. After about 5 minutes of waiting for a booth we see a lot of people come in, no one around to greet or seat them. As we all wait about another 5 minutes the hostess comes back and we are finally seated. Our server arrived quickly to our table to get our drink orders..... they bring out our sprites which tasted like straight club soda lol and that took forever to get switched out. My son ordered mac and cheese as well as a pizza, I ordered the shrimp and steak fajitas, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken crispers. My sons mac and cheese was close to cold, my steak was so over cooked that it nearly bent my wire from my braces lol and there were more onion and peppers than anything on the skillet, they brought my boyfriend one little container of ranch for 2 orders of fries and the chicken and of course no sign of our server or anyone to ask if this could be refilled. I ordered a watermelon cooler and after tasting mine my boyfriend ordered one for himself, we didn't see our server so the manager came out to take his drink order. Yeah we never got the drink. We were sitting directly across from the kitchen so I could literally see everyone pussyfooting around the kitchen. Took a good 25 minutes to get to go boxes and no one came back to our table so I guess no one gives checks anymore, we then realized we could pay from the kiosk on the table. We did and left. If it weren't for them singing happy birthday to my little guy they wouldn't have even received the 1 star I'm giving them. I think it's safe to say we will never be returning to this chilis again."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Chilis here in Las Vegas, our waitress Stephanie made all the difference.  She's outstanding and superior to most waitresses you find nowadays.  The food was awesome to go with it, she made sure our meal was to our liking before she left.  That's really sweet of her because usually my hubbies vegetables are undercooked/hard and my steaks sometimes are over cooked but, Stephanie made sure our dinner was good before leaving our tables!! I think this Chilis is the best of the many I have visited!!  Awesome job Stephanie you rock!!"}
{"text":"This Chilis is pretty regular and comparable to other locations. The service was okay and the food was average."}
{"text":"Literally just told the wait was 2 hours because of our party size. We only had 4 adults 4 kids!!! Guess we won't be coming back here again. Terrible customer service!!"}
{"text":"Good news: they brought back mozzarella sticks. Bad News: they got rid of the white chocolate molten lava cake. For shame!  I really enjoy going out to Chili's.  I consider it my old faithful as I know what I'm going to get going in.  Most of the time the service is decent, depending on how busy they are.  I have noticed they have a new two server system where two servers look out for your table.  I like this as it seems I don't have to wait long for a refill or if I need anything else.  The chips and salsa are the best I've had and of course they have many fried food options that are delicious.  The desserts are good, but as I mentioned earlier they got rid of the white chocolate molten lava cake which was my favorite.  They replaced it with a peanut butter molten lava cake which is subpar.  All in all Chili's will stay in my rotation for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"I ve been comming here for a couple years and this is the best chillis in Las Vegas. The thing that makes it so great are the two things, the food is really good and the service is outstanding. Venessa is the best sever I ve ever had she takes my order right away as soon as I sit down Shannon is an outstanding server, very nice and attentive, remembers my order only after being there one time.  The bathrooms are very clean, and this location tends to be very busy, but the bar seem pretty open most of the time. The cooks are just plain better at this location cause the food is better here at this location than at other chillis locations.  For example I order the low cal spicy chicken here and it's yummy I order it at the lake mead location and it's like eating a piece or rubber...  I highly recommend the chips and salsa they have the thinnest tortilla chips around..."}
{"text":"An older design, with a big traditional bar. Waitress is somewhat curt and pushes all the extras. Oh, they also serve food here - and it won't kill you - at least right away."}
{"text":"My first time at this location was yesterday. It was so good! We got the loaded boneless wings for our appetizer and it was so damn good. So cheesy and perfect. I got the chicken pasta dish. It was so perfectly seasoned. I didn't have to add salt or any of that. The chicken was very juicy as well. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This Chili's location is always a fun time.  Low price lunch specials, good servers, Chili's  rewards are giving away free deals, the station to pay on the table makes getting the check easy, and always plenty of sports on the tv's."}
{"text":"10 minute wait to be seated and this place was dead. Seated near bar and waited 20 minutes and not 1 person acknowledged us. No hello be with you in one minute. This place had no ac on I swear. It was hot as hell inside. Moved to the outside and we waited an hour for our food but remember this place is dead. Server said kitchen is extremely behind. I walked out f*** waiting for this shit. I've been a server. I know the difference between busy and lazy."}
{"text":"Easter Sunday. The birthday girl wanted chicken tenders from Raising Cane's but apparently they were closed for the holiday. We had just come from Cracker Barrel but didn't want to wait two hours, which is why we ended up here. Everyone was hangry and it was right next door to Cane's so we settled for Chili's. Birthday girl couldn't escape the wonderful smell of a cheeseburger, and she's not even eating meat right now! I am glad we did because our visit was more than I expected.  So let me start off by saying that yes, there are A LOT of 2 and 3 star reviews here, and yes, mine is a 4-star, BUUUUUUTTTTTT, knowing that you're gonna have to wait a little extra for your food to come out or that the service might be a tad bit below what you'd get at a Michelin   star rated fancy foo spot is only half the battle when going to a chain restaurant. You should already know this, and in my opinion, unless you've aged more than an extra 30 minutes, this should not be factored into your review, when reviewing a middle of the road chain restaurant. With that being said, yes, our food did take a minute to come out, but what made this visit memorable was the enthusiasm, charisma and charm of our server Shani. This young lady was just full of energy and friendly. She didn't pull no punches and told us the food was a little slow coming out because they were short handed, and she kept coming out just to shoot the shit with us, which were both greatly appreciated.  Moving on to the food, it was delicious and worth the wait. We got the Wisconsin cheese curds (ooey gooey goodness of fried cheese!!!!!!), wings and some kind Southwestern chicken and black bean egg rolls and all were good to go! My boy and I split a 3 item bbq plate that came with a whole corn on the cob, fries and piece of garlic bread. We opted for the ribs, which were fall off the bone and yummy, the jalapeno cheese sausage and chicken tenders. The chicken tenders were crispy, crunch and went perfect with their chipotle ranch or whatever it was. The sausage was basic, but it had a nice level of spice to it, and the cheese didn't overpower the flavor of the sausage itself. This was more than enough for us to share, but if you're a big eater, you might now want to! My wife and daughter split a chicken club, which is what I originally wanted, and again, it was more than enough food for them to share, but next time we come back, I'm gonna get that, but ain't no way in hell I'm sharing!  Overall, Shani would be the reason I'd go back to this particular Chili's in Vegas, even though there's plenty of dining choices out there."}
{"text":"First time back to Chili's for lunch in many moons.  Wow have things changed...for the better all around.  Great lunch menu that would satisfy anyone.  We were really impressed and the children's menu was very extensive with a wide variety of mains and sides.    Clean, great bar, super service and management kept checking on our table.  They have come a long way and it is paying off. Don't delay your return...it will be worth it."}
{"text":"We friggin love this place.  There is no Chili's in Canada.  So when in the US, we hit this place up.  This place would crush all Canadian places in the same class.  Red Robin's, Earls, Browns etc would be getting less business if Chili's rolled into town.  The food is real good.  On this visit they had a $10 special.  My meal included a big bowl of soup, awesome burger and fries, and bottomless drink.  Are you kidding me, the burger alone is $13 on the regular menu.  This was the most food I've had for $10....ever.  And it's good grub.  That burger ranks up there with some of the best.  I think some of the best nachos are here.  The service was top notch, which has always been the case for us at Chili's.  Of course we'll be back on our next visit."}
{"text":"Horrible service this is not the first time! My husband and I wanted to order Togo we walked in not even a  greeting. When we finally got to talk to someone she told us to go to the bar and \"Kelly\" will take out order. After about 10 mins of waiting for someone to take our order we finally just left. Went to Olive Garden across the street. Really sad because I love Chilis but there service at this location (closest to my house) is just absolutely horrible!"}
{"text":"Wander what kind of tips the waitress in the bar gets when acting like a jerk. Host is just as bad."}
{"text":"Your standard chilis menus with super slow service. We finished eating at 2pm and finally finished paying by 2:30pm. My husbands water was empty for the past 45mins and never got refilled. The folks next to us ordered a medium steak and was as raw as could be - even on second attempt they did not remediate. Unfortunately it is the only sit down restaurant in the terminal."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for Happy Hr. Half price appetizers and low priced drinks are the best. We are always treated well when we sit at the bar. Service is always fast and polite."}
{"text":"Food and service were okay this time, but the menu had some kind of wet grossness on the inner pages. Ew!"}
{"text":"Ok I can usually take it or leave it when it comes to chili's however when our friends picked it I went with it. I had the best experience we have had there!  We got seated efficiently and got Ciara as our waitress and I can't say enough good things about her. She was quite attentive and friendly! She kept our drinks full, and she listened not only to us but the kids! They both only had two crayons and not many colors so they were talking about it and without asking she brought more crayons. They both were picking cucumbers off the other moms salad plate, she brought them a bowl of cucumbers! And to top it all off she won big points with the girls when she knew who Sofia the first was! Ciara made our experience! The food was typical of the basic family American restaurants. I got the buffalo chicken salad and while it was really good, i would probably ask for the dressing on the side next time and be prepared to take 1/2 home! My friend got the chicken salad and liked it, the kids got chicken and Mac and cheese but really loved the corn on the cob. The corn came on two wooden sticks for handles and they enjoyed eating it that way but then we pulled one out and they got corn lollipops lol! An even bigger hit! The chips and salsa are always good, even got the picky kids eating salsa and asking for it at home lol!  Overall good not great food but excellent experience, if have kids ask for Ciara!! We would go back to have her as our waitress!"}
{"text":"Now that I live in a proper city, I no longer eat at places like Chili's. But that doesn't mean I don't still have a bit of fondness in my heart for the big C.   Besides how can you beat the chicken ranch sandwich (crispy breaded chicken breast w/tangy wing sauce, cool Ranch dressing, lettuce & tomato) served with a side of homestyle fries?"}
{"text":"I never write reviews but I just had to on this one. I have ate at hundreds of restaurants and never experienced such poor, horrible and rude service. They have absolutely no appreciation for the customer."}
{"text":"Update---  Chillis responded to my review and sent me to a page to contact them. The page doesn't exist. I went to their website and in the contact us section emailed them. Still nothing heard from them...  One star because the food was good! The waiter was terrible! If a customer asks for more silverware because you only put 4 out for 7 people you don't ask if they are going to use it when eating the specific food that you order. Mind you the \"kits\" of silverware contained the straws. Then at the end of the meal as we finish paying he asks for us to fill out the survey and then hunched over my brother in law while he filled it out asking that on the question \"how likely would you return?\" We should put highly likely as our answer because it will effect his schedule. Then he not only asked us once but several times and when we got to the question he said ya that one right there put highly likely for me. I don't mind feeling out the reviews but for him to tell us how to answer and then hover over us to make sure we answered a certain way."}
{"text":"We ate here today for lunch and service was horrible! We were seated promptly and it took almost five minutes for our server to come over and greet us. She took our order since we had long enough to look over the menu in her absence.  Before our food came, she informed us it would only be a few more minutes which was nice. Our food came and our waitress came right after and asked us if everything looked ok. That was the last time we saw her until it was time for the check. We came here with a kids eat free coupon and our check was wrong so she had to go fix it. She came back and apologized and told us it was so busy because of the coupon. That's funny because there were several open tables near us. I don't blame the waitress though, is one falls on management and not having enough staff to accommodate more people during busy times or when a coupon is put out. I don't understand why it is so hard to get decent service in restaurants. We are not high maintenance at all, but expect our drink glasses to never go empty, is that too much to ask? I shouldn't have to flag down a hostess or another server to refill my drink or ask for more napkins."}
{"text":"I know It's Chilis  I KNOW  I just don't like fajitas.  Unless they're from Chili's Don't know why Can't explain it  So I get to go from this Chili's.  And they're super fast and friendly. So yay for easy fajita fixes.  Mmm."}
{"text":"I can't say enough bad things about this location. What's the saying, \"Fool my once....\" I keep going back, but this most recent time was the last time. Literally sat at the bar for over twelve minutes and never got served. People came in after me and got served before me. You read that review right. The really sad thing is, this wasn't the first time this has happened. Plenty of better choices in the area."}
{"text":"Now im gonna try to sum this up as best as possible. THIS PLACE SUCKS!! I got a to-Go order yesterday with my fiance for lunch and the whole expeirience was bad. Took 10 mins to place my order, and had to endure some plump chick staring dead at me. The woman that took my order was cool and polite. She said it would be 10-15 mins. So I placed our order, then run to the Mcdonalds in the same shopping center to get our son a happy meal and came back. That took atleast 15-20 mins. So I came back, wait at the bar.....no one comes up to me. Im clearly not standing here cause im the Health Inspector, like wtf?? So the nice woman comes from the back and finally asks if she could help me. I said im waiting for an order and she said she would check to see if its ready. Mind you its already been 15 mins since standing and waiting for my food. So a manager comes out and I ask to speak with her. I told her I've been waiting for my order for almost 40 mins. She tells me that someone will be bringing my order out shortly, and here im thinking\" are you guys all in on this??\" So finally a woman comes out with my order and apologizes. I asked for a shot for the trouble and she did give me one without any question. So I get in the car and we check our orders, and why are we not suprised that the order is wrong. I go back in and tell them its the wrong order and they apologize and get the right order. Now when i placed the order I specifically told the girl ringing my order up i wanted crispy chicken instead of grilled and she said they had no problem doing it. Whhhhhhhhhhhy was the chicken grilled?? Long story long, this was the worst Chili's I've ever been too. And my girl said her turkey club sucked!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. We ordered the loaded boneless wings (they didn't say they wouldn't have sauce) but they tasted good anyway. They should have been called loaded chicken nuggets. Girlfriend and I had burgers. Not bad. Fries were good. Ranch is bomb. I'll be back. Server was okay. Not personable and did not seem like she wanted to be there. She also seemed annoyed when I asked for the printed check instead of using the machine on the table."}
{"text":"Service was attentive and food came out fairly quickly.  The restaurant was kinda busy on a Sunday night.  I ordered the chipotle chicken and waffles.  It was so filling but very good.  I ate maybe 1 and a half and took the rest home.  I would have preferred for it to not be as spicy but or was a sweet spicy and that is all in personal preference."}
{"text":"I'm only giving 2 stars  because the only reason I come here is for the green chicken chile soup and they got rid of it. Plus our server was kinda slow, took other orders while just staring at us. Even tho he was nice.. U need to be a good server too"}
{"text":"Meh. I'm not a huge fan of Chilis, not even this one. I've been here a number of times because my family likes it. The food is \"okay\"...nothing to complain about as far as a lack of freshness or anything. It's just not very original. Food is not an art at these national chain restaurants; it's just a commodity. You order a burger; that's what you're going to get. Nothing special...not even when they're trying to make it special by drowning it in ranch and adding bacon on top. It's just not special. Oh, and the beer selection is the worst; all domestic swill.  Have fun!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and the waiters are very attentive and polite. I had the white spinach queso which was good and the quesadilla explosion salad which was fresh and very good. The berry margarita was good as well especially for a chilis because I always find there drinks to be weak but here it was pretty strong which is always good! :)"}
{"text":"It's Chili's but one of the better locations I've been to.  It's either really new or recently remodeled.  We have been a few times now during happy hour.  Really good deals there.  You can get many items for $4-$5 and cheaper drinks.  My wife and I really like the skillet queso.  The fried pickles were good too.  They have really good chicken tenders with different sauces to pick from.  My wife liked the honey one and I did there spiciest one.  It had a nice kick to it.  The time before we had their fajitas which are really good.  The steak was cooked perfectly, and had good flavor.  Had lots of vegetables and I like that it comes out on a skillet.  The bartender was very attentive and we have great service.  Everything here is priced very reasonably too.  For a chain, it's really good location."}
{"text":"stopped after a baseball game.....shouldn't have.....super disappointed in the service (lack thereof).  won't ever be coming back.  don't come unless you have a lot of time and patience.    BTW, this is 10pm on a Friday night, the place is not busy enough to warrant being ignored like this. AND the topper of all.....hot plate, frozen cheesecake....makes a bunch of sense Chili's....makes a bunch of fricken sense... (just for the record, got the 2 for $35....chicken strips that defied a knife, the steak that tasted like it was cooked with shrimp....and now this.)  Huge (yuge) disappointment....."}
{"text":"4/7/2018 Came for lunch with a party of 6, Malcolm was our server,he was so knowledgeable with the menu,so kind with us,and very attentive to our table.Location is great and the food was soooo good, I will definitively be back here when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Was in there for business trip and had lunch at the airport branch. The waitress are polite and respectful.the food portion and combination is small and have lack of having good amount of vegetables. Otherwise 5 stars would be my rate."}
{"text":"What a joke, were unable to make a salad with grilled chicken instead of fried chicken. My request was incomprehensible to the staff as if no one had ever asked for a healthier version of a salad in the entire established history of restaurants."}
{"text":"Service was good  Ice tea was refreshing  I got sick from the fajitas chicken, steak and shrimp  The rice tasted like brown rice with cilantro and no other seasonings  Chips and salsa were good nice size serving  The atmosphere was fun and fiestaish"}
{"text":"Second time at this location. Both times alone so sat at the bar to eat. First time Andrew was server/bartender (lunch). He is one of the best I've seen......incredibly talented at multitasking. I was a F&B manager 25 years ago.......and Andrew is RARE to find! Tonight (Friday) Monte is behind the bar with another tender (dont know her name)...... The place is rockin tonight.......so everyone is busy, but service is still pretty good. Had something floating in my drink but Monte took care of it right away. Food a bit slow to come from the kitchen tonight but kind of expected for a Friday night. I ordered the chili-rubbed salmon. It was decent but nothing to write hone about. Brocolli and rice that came with it were both barely warm at best. Next time I'll stick to something more typical of Chili's."}
{"text":"This location is literally disgusting. We went last night and the server was either stoned or coked out because he could not stay still. Waters were empty the whole time, the queso dip was cold. Now, when I say cold, I mean thick, nasty, and freezing, as if they left it back there for 45 minutes while the employees were obviously not working. I ask him to bring a hot one, he comes back 2 minutes later with the same dip, just microwaved, we just stopped eating it. The burger was also cold, the French fries were stale, and everything was disgusting. I used to love Chilli's but this is the last time I am EVER going to one, because this food was THAT horrendous."}
{"text":"What can I say? Im a fan. Love just about everything about them. From their 20 dollar appetizer/2 entree/dessert deal to unlimited chips and salsa, their food choices are pretty good. Easy access off the 215. Minus 1 star because of one bad experience. It was just me and my wife for dinner one friday night. We were greeted right away and was seated. We were sat next to group of about 12 teenagers. Apparently our server was also the big group's server. By the time our server got to us about 15 minutes had gone by. She apologized to us for the delay. (which was appreciated). The thing that bothered me was that either our server knew the teenagers or she was gonna get a big tip from them. It seemed that for every 5 times she helped them, she would ask us if we were ok. Never mind what food we ordered or how it tasted, I was really thirsty that night and by the time I got my first refill, she was already bringing us the check. It just seemed like she didnt care if we were there or not. Now I could have easily given 2 or 1 star but since this was a server we never had, I am giving the restaurant the benefit of the doubt. We have always experienced good service until that night."}
{"text":"Great place to eat lunch or dinner and  Super nice service!  Definitely recommend this location!!"}
{"text":"It's not often I'm off on a Friday afternoon to enjoy Chili's lunch menu. This was our first time at this location, normally we dine at the location on Bell and 7th Street.   I started off with a bowl of their Southwestern Chicken Soup and it was awesome. Just the right amount of spiciness combined with a hearty portion of chicken and vegetables. My bf started out with a side salad, it a little on the small side but all the vegetables were fresh.   I ordered a chicken sandwich on a pretzel bun and requested BBQ sauce on the side instead of mayo, the BBQ sauce didn't come so I asked again when they brought the dish. Wouldn't ya know I finished my whole sandwich and fries and never got the sauce (our server didn't check on us after bringing the food until it was time to clear the plates). The sandwich was tasty but a little on the dry side. The fries were piping hot and always well seasoned.   James ordered a turkey sandwich which also came with fries. His bread was much harder than it should have been for just a toasted sandwich which was a disappointment. He also never received a refill on his soda.    If we had gotten the BBQ sauce, the refill of coke and his bread not rock hard, I would have given 4 stars for a wonderful lunch. But, since the ball was dropped on too many occasions, I can't.   I will be back to Chili's, just not this location."}
{"text":"Chili's- one of my favorite spots back east!    I was a little worried that this Chili's would not compare to my local spot back home, but alas, there was no need; it was wonderful!  The very first thing that I noticed when I looked at the happy hour menu in the bar was that they served free chips and salsa, WHOO HOOO!!!  That's not an option back home.    Sunday was happy hour all day so my buddy and I were able to enjoy 4 appetizers for under $20 bucks, what a deal!  The food was all so wonderful and tasty too, it hit the spot! The margarita I had was also worth noting, pretty good for just a traditional, I was worried it might be too sweet, but it was perfect.    Watch the glass between the bar and dining area, I turned around and a little baby had his faced squished against it and I screamed bloody murder and the whole bar stared at me!  Yikes, just do yourself a favor and keep your eyes on the TV's!"}
{"text":"The food is as standard as you can get with a chain restaurant. Service, however, is so-so.  Our waitress was friendly, however, from our booth, we could also hear the staff's conversations in the back kitchens.  Unfortunately, a guest had complications on the night we ate here and they had to call an ambulance. We found it odd for some of the staff to be insensitive that a guest needed an ambulance.  Overall, the food itself is consistent. The staff experience will keep us away for another 6 months until we come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Chili's is always pretty decent food in my opinion - nothing to write home about, but enjoyable. The service on the other hand - not great. I've been here to dine-in and picking up a to-go order: both times the service was meh. When I ordered takeout last night I had to ring the bell four times before someone came to help me. First off - I shouldn't have to ring a bell; there should be someone there to help. Second, I certainly shouldn't have to ring it multiple times. I heard someone from the kitchen say to the hostess that came to help me \"I thought it was someone else so I didn't want to go out there.\" Not sure what that was about but it was definitely not professional. I'll probably go back because it's convenient and they have a few healthy choices, but I know to not expect much on the way of service."}
{"text":"Ordered the new char-crusted sirloin...everything but crusted. No flavor except a bit salty. Supposedly garlic roasted cherry tomatoes not tasty either and the home made fries were a bit on the soggy side. The server was nice, but she definitely wasn't interested in \"selling up\" or making suggestions except the casual \"any dessert?\" Not coming back to this one"}
{"text":"Waited 35 minutes for a table. Once they called our name some scumbag couple lied and said they were us. They seated these scumbags before my wife and I were even able to get up. Once they found out what happened they made no effort to make these losers move or find us a different table. They just expected us to wait for the next table."}
{"text":"Restaurant wasn't even half full and it literally took 18 min after we were seated for any waiter to greet us or even ask if we wanted anything to drink... Smh VERY disappointed at their lack of customer service/awareness, last time I visit this Chili's"}
{"text":"Yes, I gave Chili's four stars.  No, I'm not under the misconception that it is fine dining.  However, it doesn't try to be, so why would anyone go into Chili's expecting five star cuisine? No, I'm giving them four stars because this Chili's, like all other Chili's I've been to, is consistent, and their food, though not gourmet, tastes pretty dang good.  In my opinion, compared to their competition(Applebee's and TGI Friday's), they're the best in the biz. Anyway, on the particular visit that I am reviewing (earlier today), I went there for lunch with one of my bestest friends, who insists on eating here frequently because she is in love with their Chicken Enchilada soup.  I do not share her affinity for this soup; however, there are plenty of other items I enjoy eating here from time to time.  On this particular day, like many other Americans on Sunday at lunch time, I was kind of hungover.  I was majorly craving some serious grease-laden hangover food, and Chili's did not disappoint.  I decided on the Chicken Ranch sandwich (fried chicken breast with buffalo wing sauce, ranch, and lettuce).  I asked for a side of their jalapeno ranch to dip the fries in - hangover heaven! What was also notable about this visit was that our waiter (really wish I could remember his name - he was blonde with glasses and from Minnesota), was not only friendly, not only gave us great service, but he went above and beyond.  For example, my friend is from Idaho and was telling us about something called \"fry sauce\" (never heard of it, being from Ohio).  Our waiter hadn't either but she asked if he could bring some mayo and she could make her own by mixing it with ketchup (sounds gross to me, but it's been established that she and I don't always agree in culinary matters).  In passing she also mentioned to the waiter that the best kind she had in Idaho also contained a \"secret ingredient\" which she found out was pickle juice.  So not only does the waiter come back with some mayo, he also came back with a ramekin of pickle juice that he managed to cajole out of the kitchen staff.  I was impressed! In summary, I am saying that this may not be the fanciest joint in town, but you can pretty much count on Chili's for decent to fantastic service, and some excellent and consistently prepared greasy hangover food."}
{"text":"My party and I received VIP service our server Vanessa yesterday. The food was great. Vanessa even gave us a warm bag of fresh chips to go with our salsa we were taking home too. Thanks again Vanessa we will be back and ask for you."}
{"text":"The Chilli's in the YYC domestic terminal is a prime example of why competition is so badly needed. The only spot I know of that can pour a pint once you have passed security, Chilli's struggles to deliver edible food in a timely fashion. Having been here a few too many times, I can say that this place is consistently terrible, especially for 'airport prices'. I think I have learned my lesson and will only be ordering things that come in a beer mug from now on.  Food: I had the BBQ Bacon Buger and fries.  Lindsau S. had the Buffalo Chicken Salad. We agreed, NEVER again!  One of the servers shook her head when I went to order...  She then whispers \"oh, dear, you don't want that... why don't you try this instead!\"  I thought, \"That was very nice of her!\" So I go ahead and take her suggestion. Awful. So if the food she recommended was terrible, what was she protecting me from???"}
{"text":"I'm on an avocado thing right now. To the point where I picked up a SAMs club size bag of them and when they ran out I resorted to Chilis.  I ordered there mango chile tilapia with extra avocado. It was so good. The fish was fresh and hot. The mango and avocado pico de gallo on top of the fish was a flavor explosion in my mouth. My son had a cheeseburger and ate almost all of it. Our server was nice and did pretty good. My water did sit empty for about 10 min but other then that I can't really complain. Avocado craving officially sated."}
{"text":"Decided to go to Chili's for dinner.  The location on S. Las Vegas Blvd is normally pretty busy, but we lucked out and only had a small wait. The waitress was great, and was anticipating what we needed as the evening went on!  The tables were clean, the food was hot and tasted great.  Couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Came in on 9/28 and they were obviously understaffed everyone was running around trying to catch up. We waited about 10 mins at our table until our waitress approached us and grabbed our drinks & appetizer. Then we waited about another 10 mins to order. We should've left then and there. I've noticed good service is hard to come by in Surprise. Very frustrating. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Well it amazes me that a fully stocked bar will not have mint for Mojito's.  Then they  rought soup  out without  any  crackers  or at least a bread  for dipping. All in all, t.i.o.l.i... (take it or leave it). Well maybe I was to fast to post. Well we ordered a soup and salad for one guest and a rib eye steak dinner for the other.  The Salad sucked had rotten wilted salad mixed in. Pathetic. Soup was excellent. The steak plate although was acceptable. Cane with surprises of its own. The plate came with food caked along the rim from other plates. So much so i had to wipe the plate iff before getting next to it so it would not get all over my clothes before I ate it. So you know me. I spoke to the Manager.  Since having 30 years in the business it was my duty to bring it to his attention.   Another one to cross off my list I  am thinking."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. The staff is rude, the food is terrible.  With all of the other choices in the area, this should be at the bottom of your list...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is obsessed with chilli's and I just don't understand it. And considering it is his birthday today, we had to go to his favorite place. I have been to this restaurant over a dozen times and am overall just not impressed. The service is always great- I will say that. My boyfriend and I usually sit in the bar area- tonight we sat in a booth. The restaurant itself is always very clean. The food is mediocre. I always try new items and I have yet to find something that I love. My boyfriends favorite menu item is their honey chipotle chicken crispers- I must admit that the sauce is pretty tasty. Their chicken is just off to me.. I had their chicken fajitas tonight and the chicken is so light colored it just appears like it isn't prepared right. Clearly, I know it's a chain restaurant and mostly all of their items are originally frozen... But I do not feel like the chicken in Apple bees or other chain restaurants is anything odd like that of chilli's. Overall, nothing special- unless I have a gift card that someone bought me, I don't want to eat here."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Chili's in a while, and was pleasantly surprised. Had a coupon for kids eating free (although that was the only blunder, the waitress had to go back and rerun the receipt). I had shrimp fajitas, which while a little greasier than necessary, were still delicious. Small amounts of accompanying condiments were a little disappointing. Hubby had the fried chicken tacos. As he is the world's most persnickety person, I always brace myself whenever he tries something new. But he raved about them, which was surprising in a good way. The kid's burger was typical and had the added bonus of a wheat bun. The salad they brought her was huge, which was great for parents trying to get the wee one to eat more veggies. All in all, a pleasant experience for a chain."}
{"text":"I always get good and friendly service at this location. This is probably my fourth or fifth time here. But nothing spectacular. I like the fact you can pay with one of them new kiosk things on the table. I don't know what you call it. The food is not as good as other restaurants but we get to use our plenti points for free meals. I think that's how Chillis lure customers in."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Alicia was our server and she was awesome! Too many people do good service and don't get recognized for it. So thanks!"}
{"text":"As always had a great meal at this Chili's. My boyfriend and I got the 2 for $35 where you get 2 Presidente Margaritas, an app, 2 entrees and dessert. Everything was amazing. Our server Cameo was awesome."}
{"text":"Good food but bad food choice, I ordered the half rack Memphis rub ribs, and the meat could barely fill up a starving infant . All in all don't order this"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this Chilis for the first time a couple of days ago after a late day at work.  We sat in the bar area and easily found a table.  I was impressed with the menu selections - everything looked good.  The food, however, was not as good as it looked.  It seemed as though it was a little low quality.  Not that I expected it to be a five star restaurant, but I was hoping for a little better.  My wife had a chicken salad and had no complaints about it but no raves either.  The service was also a little slow, especially for the bar area were service is usually quicker.  This was especially a problem when we need drink refills after eating jalapeno onion straws!  The person in the next booth was raving about how great the service was (he had a different server) so maybe we just had bad luck.  Overall it was ok and I might go back and give it a second try.  We will see."}
{"text":"I was just eating here and the food was pretty good. The service was great. Our waiter Jason is the best waiter. He made me and my family laugh. I would totally recommend this place if your in Vegas."}
{"text":"This location really impressed me. My boyfriend and I came in around 1 PM this afternoon and we were greeted right away. We were able to get a booth and we had Brianna as our server. She has a very bubbly personality and was attentive. We didn't have to ask for anything, She kept our waters full and made sure we had tons of dipping sauces for our Texas cheese fries. We ended up getting two bacon burgers on the 2 for $22 deal ... The fries were our appetizer plus we had fries and onion rings with the burgers. The onion rings were delicious they were sprinkled with Parmesan  cheese and garlic. The burgers were cooked well done per our request and came with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, and pickles which were kinda spicy. The deal was perfect for two people ... We were to stuffed for dessert but we will back to try more stuff on the menu. I was a little apprehensive to visit this location due to other reviews but I'm glad I have it a chance . I live very close and wanted something different and this was a good choice."}
{"text":"Its Chilis and you know what you are getting before you walk thru the door.  I like the chicken enchilada soup and ceasar salad.  I had to wait for my soup because they were making more and when I did get it...well it was so watery that I didnt eat it.  My salald was good.  Sat in the bar and the batender was friendly."}
{"text":"This place is pretty slow and the service is okay. I thought it could have a bit quicker service. They  are out of silverware on the night I've come but they \"found some\".  How does  that happen the bar is empty and there are not any patrons on the larger side. I may come back just to give it a second shot because you can't beat $35 for 2 margaritas an appetizer 2 entries and dessert."}
{"text":"Good food for a chain in a departure lounge  Best is the burger , fries are good, tex mex apps are good  Service quick efficient and remember your face if not your name  Give it a try, WJ gates, beside Timmy's"}
{"text":"Me and a friend have come here several times. 3 out of the 4 times we have gotten the same waitress... Not that u would mind, if she was a good one. We had 3 different people wait on us... I think that is ridiculous seeing how they are never busy when we go there. After today I don't think we will be going back...  Also the place needs a DEEP cleaning!!! Dust is 2 inches thick on the blinds..."}
{"text":"As a bartender at another place in riverview, I've gotta say Sam is the best bartender in the area, the guy is spot on and should run for public office.  As far as the food, it's chili's, you know what you are getting."}
{"text":"Went for the special they had on their Fajita's  2 neat choices for $10.99. It was my first time going to a chilis and honestly? It was quite filling"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner on Saturday night to celebrate birthday. Wait time was less than ten minutes. Once seated waiter greeted us. Looking at the menu I did asked for non fattening dish. Waiting yawning for forty minutes later got the dish with melted cheese on top. I asked what it was and was told it is loaded. Hmm I returned the dish and cancelled the order. Took another twenty minutes to get the bill. Waiter did not try to offer anything else. After that went to in and out for protein style burger. Much cheaper than $20 loaded dish and was much healthier too. Looks like the customer service is not that great. I probably would not back to this place. There are several other places offering dishes at better price point and try to impress you specially if you are celebrating birthday."}
{"text":"I've been to this location more than once and in every occasion I left feeling just \"OK\", I was never really impressed. So based on all my previous experiences, I would say I can rate the restaurant and this particular location on food: 2 stars and on service: maybe 4 stars. In all my previous visits, I mostly ordered from the $20 for 2 menu, which I know is a bit limited but those are options already on the menu any way so I am trying food that anyone else might try. Everything I have tried so far has been average sometimes even below. My husband in fact has said to me on a couple of occasions before, \"no more Chilis for me\". Yesterday however we went for dinner with family and I decided to order the Rancheros Chicken Tacos based on my husband's cousin's recommendation. I only replaced the beans in my order with corn on the cob. Honestly, this dish was pretty good, I can give it 4 stars and if I go there again, I guess I will probably order it once more. It was served hot and fresh, the seasoning was great and the toppings worked very well with the chicken, I enjoyed it. Service was as always pretty good so overall, our experience yesterday was much better. Of all the other things I've ordered at Chilis before, I would say their chicken and beef fajitas are pretty good and I've also enjoyed their Cajun chicken pasta at a previous dinner.  After having a better experience yesterday at this branch, I think I might give it another chance and convince my husband to go with me once more. If I do get an even better experience overall, I will be happy to update my review and rating to 4 but for now, I think 3 is fair."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 4 stars because our server was a DOLL!    Very attentive and gave us suggestions. Other positives were some meals were very very good including the Tex-mex bowl and the combination platter. Yum!  Generally food is hit or miss. Sometimes so good you can't believe you haven't been here in a while and other times nothing to write home about. Today's visit was 1/2 and 1/2. They didn't have pineapple on the Caribbean salad that was ordered and they advertise \"fresh hand cut pineapple\" in the description. Mama D wasn't happy-seeing as that's the reason she ordered the salad. It's like ordering a mushroom burger with no mushrooms! :( she mentioned it to the server who said she'd go get some and came back (expectantly) and reported that they were out. The manager came and apologized and then said he could have easily gone to the store next door for pineapple but he was too busy to. Appreciate the apology, but you should rectify a mistake with more than words sometimes, especially since it was an $11 salad!   Bottom line: We were glad we had a gift card. We'll be back because sometimes it's great, but we left sad today."}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just need to have a lazy Saturday with some food-to-go.  Chili's delivered (well, not literally, but their food got the job done)!  We ordered take out around noon, with an appetizer of potato skins and each had the honey chipolte chicken crispers meal.  It comes with french fries and corn on the cob.  Corn on the cob to go that is hot and all things good, is hard to find in my book.  We've been here plenty of times to eat in, but thumbs up on the take out!"}
{"text":"Our server Jimmy was AMAZING! I've never had such great service at this Chili's or any other Chili's before. He was attentive, helpful and personable. My family and I will be back."}
{"text":"Favorite go-to place whenever I want a good, well priced restaurant! This location always has the best staff. Every time I come here my waitress/waiter is super nice and welcoming. Every table now has little computer screens where you can pay your bill (if you're paying with card), play games for the kids, and reorder your drinks if you run out! The 2 for $20 deal is the best, you get tons of food for a great deal; one appetizer and two entrees."}
{"text":"I've written a review for a Chili's at a different location. All I can say is regardless of where they are located it is all the same. I tend to frequent this one more often however service can be very slow....."}
{"text":"As much as I would love to rate Chili's higher I just couldn't do it. The last few times I've been there the service was very slow however the waitress was very nice and helpful everything just seemed to take forever to come out. I will say I love the honey chipotle chicken crispers and the corn is always incredible. I always get chips and salsa even though it fairly basic it still one of my favorite thing there. I'm not knocking the food or even the staff just the time it takes to get seated and the time it takes for the drinks and food to come out...."}
{"text":"So as I have said before in other reviews at different chili's locations the service was slow. With that being said when I visit this location i usually stop in for lunch. I order the unlimited soup and salad (which i never end up ordering any more than what comes out) because I love the baked potato soup and the endless salsa and chips.......the salad used to be fine when it was all romaine but since chili's got cheap on everyone now you get a mixed bunch of who knows what because it looks more like weeds on my plate than salad and that is a huge disappointment to me. BRING BACK ROMAINE LETTUCE!"}
{"text":"Same Norma food you'd expect- but service sucks!!!  Our waiter seemed to be the only one who even cared- but with that he was super slow.   One waitress seemed like it was a waste of her time to even be asked a question- and if you did ask her something - nothing happened because she just didn't care."}
{"text":"Upon first arrival we noticed Brooklyn and her magnificent hair!  Our server Michael was handsome and polite.  We started off with the caso dip and chips.  SO very delicious."}
{"text":"A pretty standard Chili's in terms of available seating, food options (and prices), and service. Nothing Vegas-special about it beyond the view of the Strip, but the normal great Chili's quality applies."}
{"text":"Sad. The service was poor and the food even worse at this location. We were immediately seated as it wasn't too busy and then after that it was downhill. The drinks took 15 minutes from the minute our request was taken. The appetizers were taking so long we were given chips to for the time wait. The appetizers finally arrived and they were just ok. For my entrée I ordered the tacos platters from the fajitas menu and the tortillas were cold and hard. My husband and daughter got ribs and seemed content. As I started to eat my meal I pulled a thick black hair out of my taco which I was already eating, luckily the server was right in front of me and she was shocked! I was disgusted. She immediately offered to have my plate remade and I said ok as to not ruin my family dinner. Everyone finished their meals and I still waited for my plate. When it finally came, I was just skeptical and couldn't enjoy my food, and alone at that. I just wanted to leave. My youngest daughter needed to use the bathroom and I took her and was just beyond disgusted by dirty walls and bathroom stalls. It was below any average standard. Just terrible. Then we returned to our booth as I saw the kitchen. I saw all this food on the floor and a bunch of lazy employees just walking on, over and around it. Like can you please sweep. I asked for the check and barely touched my food after. To no surprise I saw the check and was billed for my mediocre meal Im shocked I wasnt also charged for the hair in it. I felt like I couldn't pay and leave quick enough. I'm so disappointed, this is my local Chili's and I don't expect I will ever return or recommend this place to anyone ever. STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"This company as a whole is like a bad acrylic sweater. It'll slowly drive you nuts, with its itching and pilling until one day you rip it off, throw it in the trash and scream ENOUGH! I could go on about the recent years of plates with false bottoms giving you the illusion of a full size $12 salad but more the equivalent of a side salad, poorly executed freezer food, raw hamburgers, cold soggy French fries, a roller coaster ride of good and bad customer service and some bad press. Well, this location dealt me it's company's final blow. I will never willingly set foot in another chili's location as long as I'm alive. I entered early evening to be seated. The restaurant was empty. I requested a booth. The seemingly charming pixie of a hostess was more concerned whether my pre-teen needed a coloring menu. She proceeded to walk us to a table in the back corner of the restaurant. I reiterated that we wanted a booth. (Much like the six empty booths she just walked us by.) She proceeds to say, literally \"Ha, like we don't have any booths right now.\"  Either chili's has an amazing ghost clientele or she's got a few screws loose. We left. We never sat. We never ate. We will never return. Maybe we'll return after we are dead. Perhaps we'll finally get that booth we requested."}
{"text":"Best chips in town. Thin and light with just the right amount of salt. The salsa is hit or miss and definitely needs some heat. The skillet queso is not the best and can use some work. I suggest using chorizo, jalapeños and pico.   This location was busy and but we were seated right away. Our server was VERY attentive. Almost to attentive. Every time she walked by she asked how was everything. This interrupted our convo several times. Maybe she is new but it got annoying."}
{"text":"First and foremost the only reason I'm here is because someone gave me a gift certificate. Since my last encounter with Chili's, I swore to never eat here again. I have to say, the Chili's corp has stepped up there game. Food was good, new menu looked great, and the new happy hour specials looked cheap and awesome. I had zero food complaints this time from me or my kids. Our waiter was a total zombie that hated his life and his job, but not my problem.  After this positive experience, I just may come back someday."}
{"text":"Love the Chilis menu in general, but this location is just plain bad. The few times I've eaten here it has been dirty and sub bar service. Now tonight I show up at 9:40 and the doors were already locked. I know it sucks to have someone come in close to closing time, but all I wanted was one beer and some chips and salsa to go. I would have been gone before closing time at 10.  Poor form."}
{"text":"We had the best service and food we have had in a very long time. Our server Clay was great very friendly, helpful and kept making sure we were doing okay. The food was very good came out hot and fresh mine was made to order as I asked.  Very happy with everything we will be back and will definitely be asking for Clay to be our waiter."}
{"text":"We had a nice meal. ... The ambiance is typical dinner.  ... The menu lots of choices.  ... Our favorite  is $22 for 2 persons. ... pick one appetizer and 2 main dish with side dishes.  ... Kids menu is also good. ... my son favorite  is grilled cheese sandwich  Or the mini burger. ... Food  and customer service  are good. ...  We always have a nice meal. ..."}
{"text":"Stopped  Saturday  mid afternoon, not super busy. They said 5 minute  wait. Started  looking  around tables not bussed stuff on floor not very appealing if hungry. We turned around  and left, whoever  is in charge of this restaurant  needs to open their  eyes. Won't be back for long while. Hire some help. Wonder what  kitchen  looks like."}
{"text":"Some of our favorite chain food, food here I'd always hot and fresh, service at this location has always been good for us."}
{"text":"I come here once in a while. This place is a step up from Applebees but still lands on my mediocre list.   The menu is all over the place, I never know what to order. But, they do usually have deals such as 25$ for two. So you order 2 entrees that comes with an appetizer for 25$. Today that was not on the menu anymore. They did have a dinner one for $35 but I didn't really pay much mind to it.   I've had few different items on their menu. One that I usually get is the Texas fries. It's basically loaded fries (cheese, jalapeños, and bacon). I have had their flat beard before which are pretty good. The beau usually gets their ribs which really aren't anything special.   They added these screens at each table. You can order your dessert, ask for a refill, look at the menu, play games (for 99cents each game), and pay your bill on. It's pretty neat because it even allows you to split the check and tells you how much to tip!   Found out that all day Sunday is Happy Hour but only at the bar and we had already sat ourselves in the dinning area and ordered our foods. darn! They had some good discounts of food and drinks too!   Service is usually on the slower side. Today it was pretty fast surprisingly."}
{"text":"Its not bad i had the steak medium rare, overall good rating. Place needs a little clean up with mess on the floor but other than that still good."}
{"text":"This location is the closest one to where I live and my girlfriend and I usually come when we're feeling like a nice decent affordable meal. They have great options here for very fair prices. Food usually gets out in a timely manor depending on how busy it is. Actually everything depends on how busy it is here. We been coming to this location for a year almost two now and it's a hit or miss on service. It's never consistently good whitch is a bummer. When their busy service can be straight horrible but there's times where I came in and it's not too busy and everything will be like a walk in the park perfect. Other than the jumpy service everything here is great! This location is one of the newer models and is very nice inside compares to the older ones."}
{"text":"Our service was amazing yesterday! Our food was great and very tasteful as always. The only reason I am giving them fours stars is because it took us a while to get our food and they weren't busy at all. Aside from that, everything was great! It's a very chill and most importantly clean!!"}
{"text":"Not really a big fan of Chili's. Their food lacks flavor, and it seems so hard to get a beer from the bar without having to stand there forever. the waitress was nice, but it took forever to get our food and bill. It wasnt the worst, but I guess I expected better."}
{"text":"Worst service. Poor waiters, Her and her partner were not at all on point. Neither of them were on the same page when trying to help us. We went from having 1 server then 2 ...then none... Food didnt come out in order because the waitress forgot to run the food out to us till it was cold. They gave us a new one when we were already done eating and still charged us. Every request went ignored like ranch instead of blue cheese and an extra side of salsa and ranch that didnt come. The table next to us along with several others were filthy and not cleared with trash left all over the floor. Chilis has really gone downhill."}
{"text":"Sad to say but this review won't be a good one. Perhaps if we chose to sit in the normal seating area things would have went different. We sat in the bar & there was only 1 waitress to service the whole area & of course it's super bowl sunday.  Waters had floaties-yuk. The waitress says it looks like it's from lemons so of course we say we didn't have lemons with our water. So we get some new waters. Next is the appetizer- chips, salsa & bean dip with a side of hair in the beans. The kid's fries came with a complimentary salt like. So much salt on these bad boys you'd think it was a cured prime rib. Chicken came out raw so that went back to the kitchen.  But my favorite of all the unpleasantries was the fact that I had to try & enjoy my meal with a stack full of dirty plates in my face the whole entire meal.  My girlfriend had a nice friendly chat with the manager & he comped our entire meal. I always feel bad for complaining but there was so much wrong that sometimes you gotta stand up & say something."}
{"text":"We understand Chili's business plan is to not let any food leave the kitchen less than 30 minutes after the order was placed bit this was worse. After 40 minutes our food came except our child's was missing. 5 minutes later it comes, but was not what we ordered. The server gave us some BS excuse of that's not what the waiter entered, but what they brought us was not even on the menu. No accepting of responsibility or making it right, only \"I can start another if you'd like.\" We didn't have another 45 minutes to wait and had an engagement to get to. No restaurant should mistreat a hungry child. Absolutely no one cared about our situation or us as customers. We won't return."}
{"text":"Decent food at a decent price.  The service was really good so I gave them 4 stars instead of just an average 3 rating."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Chili's for awhile, but due to time-constraints / work schedule; I decided to meet Jade here for lunch.  We went on Sunday.  I didn't know this ,but if you sit at the bar on Sundays, it's happy hour all day.  Selected appetizers are on the happy hour menu for a discounted price.  You also get free chips and salsa!  Pros:   * We went during lunch hours.. it seemed really busy, but nonetheless we got sat immediately.   * The waitress was very nice and checked on us numerous times.  I can happily say that I didn't have to hunt down a waitress to refill my Sprite.   * Cheap eats...especially during the Happy Hour  Cons:   *  We ordered the Cajun Pasta and the Wings and just really wasn't thrilled about neither.  The wings were boneless and the sauce overpowered the taste of chicken.  The pasta was really thick, but at the same time lacked in flavor.  The best part about it was the grilled chicken that I added on for an extra charge (you also have the option of adding shrimp for an additional charge).     Overall:   To be fair, I failed to realize that the pasta dish was Penne (which I totally hate).  I really feel as if I just made some bad choices with my order.  I know Chili's has burgers that are on-point every time I order them.  The service was good and the prices were too.. and you definitely can't beat free chips and salsa!  Nothing spectacular, but not horrible either.    Tips:   *  Sit at the bar if you come on a Sunday... Happy Hour all day + Free Chips/salsa   *  Appetizers on the Happy Hour menu are of a smaller portion.. just a heads up   *  If you are looking to catch some sports, there are flat screens throughout the bar."}
{"text":"The worst Chili's I've ever been to. First the greeter asked if we could sit in the lounge area. No problem except every table in the lounge area was full of dirty dishes. Went back and asked for a regular table and she then asked us 5 times if we could sit in the lounge area instead of letting us sit at a table. I guess she didn't feel like cleaning a lounge table for us so she finally gave us a table in the dining area, RIGHT NEXT TO THE BATHROOM. Then the waiter was horrible. Must have been his first day or he should just find a different job. Took 15 minutes to get an iced tea and water. Finally got our food, and then never saw our waiter again. Had to flag down a different waitress to get to-go boxes and our check. Horrible experience. ZERO STARS. ABSOLUTELY NO MANAGEMENT."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. I normally like chili's, but this is the worst one I've ever been in. The last two times I was in Vegas I stopped here and regretted it every time. The workers act as if you're not there. The waitresses aren't as bad as the hostesses. They completely ignore you. Today I watched a guy walk out complaining to the hostess that he sat there for 10 minutes and nobody took his drink order. She shrugged and looked away. When I got my salad today the lettuce was wet and tasted soggy. Eat somewhere else until management actually manages."}
{"text":"Awesome, fast service at this location!  The server we had was very kind and patient, didn't make us feel rushed or anything."}
{"text":"Usually we sit in the \"family\" area, but this time, we decided to sit in the bar area.  There were more television screens and the staff seemed \"overly happy\" to have a good time.  I'm assuming this is because they're trying to more \"BAR\" than \"family restaurant.    Though the attentiveness and the food arrived at a decent time, we noticed a difference in how the entrees were plated.  We decided to order 2 for 20 menu.  For the appetizer, we chose the Chips and Salsa.  The salsa had spilled all over the plastic bowl and the chiphs were so thing that it was like eating rice paper!  They were also doubled over in salt.  We had to literally shake some off.   The entrees arrived and we were a bit shocked.  My husband ordered a pasta and chicken dish.  There was more sauce and pasta and the smallest piece of chicken.  I had ordered the \"Famous\" Babyback ribs and wedges (which they were out of, so they substituted fries).  This was fairly unacceptable.  I was served on a salad plate.  Didn't resemble a entree, but an afterthought or \"extra\" serving plate, when you order the entree..  There wasn't barely meat on the bones and the sauce barely covered the 1/2 rack.  It seemed like they were sacrificing quality and quantity of food to pay for the new flat screens everywhere.    If they are going to cater to an adult crowd, they there needs to be a strict policy whereas no children are allowed in the bar area--drinking or not.  We have nothing against children, but they need to remain in the family area-- especially if there is a chance for  people to order alcohol.  Now, this is just an opinion, when on a date night or date lunch or something for the couple, its the goal to have it be some adult time, not time to take care of or appease other peoples children.  (This goes the same for cruises~ even more so... Some are looking for a vacation to remember and rekindle--only distracts from the purpose why were there.  Again, I have absolutely nothing against children, but I do feel like parents need to exercise some judgement about where and when to family time is different than couple times."}
{"text":"For starters our appetizers never made it out to us since the kitchen burned it. Which our waiter let us know of the kitchens misshap. When the entrees came out they served one of us an extra blackened salmon burned to crisp on the bottom.  Unfortunately this wasn't the end of our excellent experience they also managed to burn the chicken that someone else ordered. Fire your cooks service despite all the burned food was decent. Thanks for the free dessert."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and professional staff. I was impressed. The food was delicious and they had $5 Margaritas that were so good. We were checked on often and given compliments by the hostess. The staff were personable and I appreciated the good service!"}
{"text":"This place had the worse service EVER!!! Waiting on waitress for more than 10 mins just to say hi and ask for drink order. Then waited another 15 mins for her to ask her manager about an appetizer cuz she wasn't sure at all. Took 30 mins to get a refill on our drinks.the time we were seated there was 4-5 tables not cleaned the entire time we had already been seated all the way till we left. Never again at this location. Oh and the manager was talking to a table for 30 mins instead of helping his crew out! Smh! Horrible service all the way around!"}
{"text":"Ok, so far... no coronitas for margaritas, no Miller Light on draft? Service was good, food good."}
{"text":"Worst service hands down I ever received at a Chili's. We were in a party of ten and arrived at 8:45 given they close at ten. Before coming and talking to us the servers were talking in back and when they came up they told us that the kitchen closed at 9:45 and that we were better off going to Applebee's. We had a whole hour to order technically and obviously we probably wouldn't have taken longer than 15 min to order since we're regulars. Since they were already trying to kick us out we couldn't imagine their service would get any better if we would have stayed."}
{"text":"Eat here all the time and never got a bad meal or bad service.  I just don't understand the negs they've gotten from one of my favorite places to eat.  I've been coming for 4 years at least on a weekly basis so it's not like a one time shot.  Great food, good prices, and excellent staff."}
{"text":"We WERE regulars here, the past few times have been disappointing. From the cleanliness of the place, to the service and even the food. It's just not as good as it used to be.  Disappointed because we really liked it before. The place just feels dirty, my sons meal came out way later than the rest. My other son said his steak was drowned in butter, and his broccoli was cold and rubbery. Crispers were soggy. Yuck"}
{"text":"I feel bad giving this restaurant three stars.  In a nutshell, service was awesome, not because of our waitress, but because the manager and others were constantly stepping in to flawlessly help while our server was \"in the weeds.\"  Great/Awesome/Amazing team effort!!!    Thing is, there were a lot of open tables which leads me to believe that they had a \"tiny\" wait because they wanted to seem busy but were understaffed (common trick).  (My wife and I only went here as a last resort  because it was the only place with less than a 10 minute wait and we had a movie to see.)  I really wanted to love this place, but I just can't get past the \"chain\" crap food!  Service was fine, but the food kinda sucks given the alternatives in the neighborhood.   Conclusion: skip this place unless you are in a time crunch; there are too many other great places to eat at."}
{"text":"FOLLOW UP 1/3/16. Looking back at this I want to add that we did indeed call the restaurant. The manager came on the phone & explained that she had a protocol, questions she had to ask for their insurance company in case we sued. I told her we were not going to sue, but she asked them nonetheless. She concluded by saying she wanted to mail me some coupons for 2 free meals. I gave her our address, but she NEVER SENT THEM. Phoney half-job doer manager.  Next we were given an online form to fill out for the Maricopa County Health Department, which we did. I'm changing her rating from 2 stars to one star and we WILL NOT BE BACK, and it's a shame. We always liked Chili's, because they have a very wide spectrum menu. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ((ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS: Went there about 1:45 PM Sunday, 13 DEC 2015. They said it'd be a 15 minute wait. My wife went straight to the restroom and the table closest to the restrooms was clean and empty. After about 20 minutes they showed us to that same empty table. WHY DID IT SIT EMPTY FOR 20 MINUTES? Work slowdown? Or not enough help to get the job done?  The place was very crowded and the staff was plenty busy. I had a California Turkey sandwich. Excellent taste, well prepared,  My wife had the Quesadilla EXPLOSION Salad and it was as good tasting as it was aptly named, because it caused her an intestinal explosion of diarrhea and stomach pain. I'll phone the restaurant and let the county health dept know as well.  Maybe it's too close to Chipotle (which is next door). Maybe their bugs have migrated west that 75 feet or so to Chilis."}
{"text":"We decided to go here because they are very close to home. We were pleasantly surprised by the very good service offered to us by Cody. He was accommodating and thorough offered suggestions for food and drink. The table side guacamole made by Cody was excellent . The food was good, served hot and with any little changes (sauce on side) etc. the drink prices are not listed anywhere but are very reasonable. The hostess was fun and friendly."}
{"text":"There are only two things I need from a waitress: a full drink and the ability to pay and leave when I want. This place had neither.  I get it- it's an airport. I also get that I was there in the early morning, but it was during your open hours, so there should be no reason for me to be leaned over 7, count 'em, seven times for other waitresses to put random stuff on my table. They didn't want to refill my drink either.   The service was terrible. There were 5 waitress and about that many tables. We're dealing with a one to one ratio here. With that in mind, it's unreasonable that I be visited so little by my server. Once to order, once to bring my food, and once to bring the bill I hadn't asked for (that's cool, I won't have anything else) where I had to suggest that my  long-empty drink be refilled.   She never came back for me to pay- I approached the bar to do so after a long wait. Let's review for a minute that this is in an airport. People have flights to catch!   The food was actually decent- I didn't expect a good breakfast from chili's, so that's why this is a two star eating instead of one."}
{"text":"I remember when the Chili's on Eastern and St Rose Parkway was this good, That was a long time ago."}
{"text":"This location is the most friendly of all the Chili's in the Valley. Steve always makes us feel welcomed and cared for in the bar. I highly recommend the smoked wings for happy hour."}
{"text":"I don't usually give the full 5 stars but this place has earned it over a long period of time. It is consistently good and it is a good value. For some reason they are one of the few establishments that can get beer at the right temperature . They know how to do it the right way. It is always perfect.  Look, I have to admit that corporate restaurants have a place in my restaurant rotation. I'm not saying they should be your favorite spot or I'm not saying that you should go here every Friday night - but I am saying that this location is consistently great - they have earned a place in your rotation.  We enjoy it every time we go. What else is there to say? Great staff and great management."}
{"text":"Our party of 5 enjoyed a wonderful luncheon experience due to the excellent service provided by Terri.  All dishes were served exactly as ordered, food was hot and portions were generous.  Terri stopped by our table several times during the meal to inquire about satisfaction, the dining room was clean and the luncheon specials were well priced."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero I would.  Service is absolutely horrible..  I came in twice this week spur of the moment..  First time was bad..  Server didn't get anything right.. But I decided to give it a. Second chance xuz the manager was nice and other employees helped out.  Second time was just as bad.  Literally a waste of time and money for mediocre crap food..   Fajitas usually are great. And we like the drinks so we just went with it.  Never again..  My standards of service are high..  It's not about the flip of the table if the service is crap.  If we would've been taken care of .. Compensation is always guaranteed with me.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Jalisa the bartender was amazing! My boyfriend and I came in for my birthday and she was extremely prompt, friendly and knowledgeable. She was able to answer all questions and ensured our food was good and our drinks never empty!"}
{"text":"I love this place since you can buy a whole lot of food for like $35.  And they actually check your to-go orders every time so you don't have to wonder why you're missing a sauce or what not.  I think that it's actually great in this sense since I know a couple places that consistently screw up to-go orders.  So to the to-go crew?  You guys rock it out for this national chain.  Which is saying something since it's like giving 4-stars to McDonalds. :)  Oh wait... have I done that? hmmmmm...."}
{"text":"Walked in, party in front of us, they were waiting for host/hostess.. more people came in, still no host/hostess. Party in front of us signaled the guy sweeping the floor to check on the host/ hostesses. Guy comes over and was nonchalant, did not apologize for the wait. We were finally seated but after waiting again for minutes, we got up and left. They don't care about their patrons, I won't care to give them my money."}
{"text":"Went many times as it is very close to my home. But everytime I am seeing the same problem. 10 minutes to get greeted by someone once you arrive, this time after finishing dinner we had to wait for another 20 mins to get the bill , as the ziosk not working.. then we got a wrong bill. Another 10 mins wait for the correct bill.. never going back.."}
{"text":"Went for dinner here last night, 6:00 pm on a Thursday evening, with my husband and a 74 year old Grouch (my snowbird Dad). Wasn't expecting it to be great, based on the reviews here, but we had a gift card to use up.  As we arrived, a young lady rushed to open the door for us, welcomed us, and sat us in a booth as requested. Our waitress (Carrie) showed up almost immediately and took drink orders for my husband and me (Dos Equis Lager pints) while Dad was washing up in the restroom. She had our drinks back at the table before Dad was seated, and took his drink order right away. They had Coors Light on tap, which made him happy... except we had to explain why we got lime wedges, but he didn't. The service for the rest of the night was equally responsive and very polite. Carrie was also knowledgeable and helpful with the menu choices when we ordered our food - there were so many things that looked appealing to me on the menu, that I had a really hard time deciding.  It didn't take long for the food to arrive, but both my Dad's meal (Mango-Chili Chicken) and my husband's (Southwest Pairing - Cheese Enchilada/Chicken Enchilada/Cup of Southwest Chicken Soup), and also the cup of black beans that came with my Chicken and Shrimp Fajitas were on the cold side, and had to go back to the kitchen to be warmed up. Carrie was apologetic (good thing, or the Grouch would let her have it) and quick to correct everything. Otherwise, everybody's food was really delicious and well-presented. Portions were decent and I felt there was really good value for the price. Even the Grouch was raving about his meal.  All in all, the service, value, menu choices, and food get five stars in my book.  Room for improvement, should management be reading this (pretty minor): - Food wasn't consistently hot  -Tortillas for the fajitas were bottomless, but I wish they would use bigger ones rather than taco-sized. - The restaurant was really cold inside, and the waitress did tell us that other people had complained and she was trying to correct it - The restroom was really cheaply constructed and could use cleaning attention - The dining area was really loud - For a Tex-Mex restaurant, they should really consider having some real hot sauce  choices other than Tobasco.  We'll be back, and I'm sure the Grouch will be bringing one of his Sun City girlfriends here, as well."}
{"text":"Most of the time we get Chile's to go.  We will get hamburgers because if you get the big mouth burger to go it can cost the same some fast food joints or a couple of dollars extra.  We decided to dine in here the other day.  We have been here a couple times.  We put our name on a list and waited.  The girl sat us down.  I don't know but there is something so annoying about Chile's hostesses.  We sat down and must of sat there for a good 15 minutes, which in my book is a little excessive for someone not to swing by and say be with you in a \"sec.\"  We finally had a waitress swing by and ask for drinks, by that time I was already annoyed and my wife did most of the drink ordering.  The restaurant was busy so I just needed to relax, so I tried to.  The girl never came back!  I don't know where she went.  I could of blamed it on her helping other tables, but she wasn't anywhere.  We finally ordered and when the food came it was completely wrong.  Guess what the waitress didn't bring the food, which is OK because I don't think they do that anyway.  The waitress was gone again.  I actually got up from the table to grab a person to ask them to find her.  The guy I asked helped me out and took the food back.  Then another guy came to the table.  This is when I got really mad.  The worst thing a restaurant can do is send the manager to the table in my opinion.  why can't the waitress come by an tell me anything.  He asked if we could describe the waitress.  Then he said the next few words that just make me an angry person.  He said, \"the food is on us!\"  I hate that, because I don't mind paying for food, I just want service! Well off my soap box now on the service portion.  Don't bother with this Chiles on Eastern, just get it to go and enjoy it in front of the boob tube.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"A chain, fast casual restaurant that cranks out the food as fast as it can.  Showing up here to celebrate a friend's birthday felt like we were being hurried.  If I am here to celebrate, don't try to push me out.  Seating was the easy part, our server was great.  He was funny, able to make suggestions for those that weren't sure and completely on top of his game throughout the whole time we were there.  Who wasn't on top of their game?  The manager.  If you want your customers (especially those that are part of a large party) to feel welcomed with hopes of them coming back, don't stand within earshot of \"Table 43\" and start complaining about how long we were taking.  Yes I heard you Miss Manager, I am not dumb, your tabletop touchscreen displays the table numbers and 43 just happened to be ours.  I thought that it was a good thing that the table kept ordering items, going for a dessert round, that equates to a higher bill and more revenue for your restaurant, maybe a higher tip for your serving staff.  What it actually ended up doing was irritating me that you said it loudly enough to be passive aggressive and kept staring at our table.  You obviously don't want business in here because you will no longer be getting mine.  Asides from that huge hiccup, the food was decent, prices reasonable, mixed drinks watered down, atmosphere was meh.  So your typical subpar Chili's."}
{"text":"For airport food....not bad. We were greeted promptly and kindly. Seated right away, which is always nice at the airport...not too long after sitting down our waiter greeted us and took our drink orders right away. So right off the bat, I would say the customer service is pleasant for a busy airport.   They also have double shots for only $5 more which was nice. I ordered, a gin and tonic and made it a double for sure. lol. Our food didn't come out the fastest, but the place is busy and it wasn't that much longer. Our food did come out hot and pretty tasty for a chain restaurant in an airport.  Our server stayed tentative to or needs which is nice because people are always on the go and trying to catch a flight. He kept an eye on us and when it was time for us to check out, he was ready.   For airport food this place is above sub par. Great service, good food, and decent prices...especially after dinning the past few days on the strip. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Happy with the service. This is just a great last minute place to grab good food. Never have had a bad experience here yet."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks, and wasn't disappointed. The bartender Steve was absolutely fantastic! Loved my jalapeño margarita, and the Nut Brown and Sam Adams Winter Lager. Will definitely be back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"We had the best service and the most amazing margarita tonight! They also have a special that you get free chips and salsa. So much food we have lunch for tomorrow. Will definitely be back for the special margarita!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on date night and the food was delicious we both ordered tacos and a margarita. The service was great and the wait time wasn't long at all for a Saturday night and it was packed. Great Food, Great Service and we will be back again. Oh and kudos to putt waitress for keeping a smile on here face and making recommendations on the menu items."}
{"text":"The 2-for-$20 deal is why I go here..  My boyfriend loves the honey chipotle chicken crispers with mashed potatoes and gravy with fries.  My daughter loves the half rack baby back ribs with mash potatoes and gravy.  I dont really have a favorite, I've ordered something different everytime..  I recently tried the chicken tortilla soup, that was nommy.."}
{"text":"It's a Chilis, but a good one. Nice staff, clean bar and pretty quick service considering how busy it usually is. Glad it's close by the house - a regular stop for the wife and I for the occasional night out while not straying too far from home. Sierra Nevada on tap too, so I'm sold."}
{"text":"I've gone to this location MANY MANY times and I must say the service is always one way or another. At times they can be amazing and super helpful. But then there are these times when the people that work there are just down right RUDE. Today my husband called to ask if they delivered(an option that we had seen inside their store last time we were there) and the lady on the phone \"Stephanie\" hung up on him without even answering the question. I then called back and explained what had just happened and there wasn't even an apology from her and no sense of remorse. Needless to say that we are definitely on the verge of never going back again."}
{"text":"Good food for the price. Awsome waitress so nice and very knowledgeable! Our dinner was great. 2 for 20 great price for the food."}
{"text":"Coffee machine down, service at an all time low, took 30 minutes for a salad to come out"}
{"text":"Kaytea is the best bartender and server EVER! We always sit in the bar area so that she can serve us and we can chat with her. Seriously, her bartending skills are amazing and she is a sweetheart! It is worth the trip to Chili's just for Kaytea! Then you are doubly rewarded by eating off of their killer menu."}
{"text":"Worst Chilli's I've ever been to. Our waitress came to our table once to refill our drinks, our food took 45 mins to get to our table and one of the orders was wrong so we had to wait another 20 to get the right order. The manager did not come to our table once and it was just an awful experience. I'm a huge chillis fan but after this experience I will never go to this chillis again."}
{"text":"Well it had been about a year since I had been to chili's but decided to try it again. After waiting 5 min for the bartender to see me, I ordered a blue moon and cheeseburger. After a 20 min wait the cheeseburger arrived. It had no seasoning on it - completely lacking of flavor. Cheese was nicely melted and bun was good. I had to flag the bartender down to get a napkin. Then later on to get my tab. Maybe they were short handed? I know chili's is trying to go all digital ordering, but zero communication is not good. And sometimes a little customer service goes a long way."}
{"text":"Destiny was a ray of sunshine for me after just walking out of a nearby restaurant due to awful service. She was bubbly, attentive, knowledgeable, and all around fantastic. We will very certainly be asking for her from now on, on Wednesdays here and any time we are at her Gastonia location. Enthusiasm is just one of those things you just can't teach someone to have. But Destiny crushed it, turning my horrible night 180° around and making it into an amazing one. Couldn't be happier! Thank you!"}
{"text":"If I did not have a friend working here, I would have waited for thirty minutes without anyone taking my order.  That's not the worst. The cook on the steak is off and the shape of the steak is weird, but it tastes fine. However, I could not use the knife provided to cut the steak. I asked for a better knife but I was told that it is the only type they have. So I left after having two bites of my $20 steak.  Moral of the story: don't go here! (unless you want your whole night to be ruined)."}
{"text":"We went in, set at the table for 10 min.  4 waitresses and the host walked by us without making any contact.  Table was sticky as if a dirty rag was used to clean it.  After walking out we find the manager hanging out at the door.  He did offer to take care of us but after sitting down for 10 min without any contact we left."}
{"text":"After calling briefly being placed on hold, then being told they do have a Happy Hour from 5-7, we arrived to the bar at around 6:45pm  with only 3 patrons on a Thursday night. After waiting for about 6 mins. we were finally greeted. I asked if there are any happy hour or beer specials, and received the simple reply: \"No\". We ordered $5.25 draft beer, and reviewed the menu. After about 10 mins., she finally asked if we would like to order...NO. Very disappointed in the service at a place the employees are supposed to make you feel welcomed."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night 11-6-13. One star for the bad service. We sat there without being greeted by our server for about 15 minutes. Servers were walking our section but just kept ignoring us. Finally once someone came we placed all our orders and I felt like it still took longer than usual to get our drinks. Our server had a feeling like either he was asked to stay late to take our table or as if he came in late for his shift and had to hit the ground running and catch up. Either way the food was the food. It's a chain restaurant. Might stop by for happy hour one day to try some drinks but not again for dinner. Such horrible service for such a slow night."}
{"text":"Gave this Chilis a second chance however same results. Tons of open tables but yet 30 min wait. Not busy. Late Sunday night. Plus lots of dirty tables and floor a mess. Why can't this location get it right."}
{"text":"I had the Smokehouse Combo, and man was it good! I had smoked ribs and sausage, roasted street corn, fries, garlic bread, and the house made garlic dill pickles.  The meat was flavorful, the starches were plentiful (need to cut down on that...), and those pickles are always out of this world with flavor.  The only part that was a little bit lacking was the corn, it wasn't \"roasted\" well enough to have that unique flavor, and it came out tasting like regular corn on the cobb with a tiny kick to it.   All in all, the meal was delicious, the restaurant was clean and chill, my server was on point, and I had no complaints. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I always come here with family and friends. The food is great and service time is quick. This is one of our go to, \"cheap\" restaurant food choices and we are never disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came here with Don on his 45min lunch break. We ordered bottomless chips and salsa, an Avocado Burger to split, blackberry iced tea, and mango iced tea. We were really pressed on time, but they managed to bring everything out right away. The iced teas were tasty and refreshing. It was nice to see Blackberry iced tea on the menu, since not many places have that in their iced tea selection. The Avocado Burger was good, but nothing special. It was on a wheat bun with avocado, red onion, and Swiss topped with avocado-ranch. They knew that we were sharing so they brought it out to us cut in half already (always an added bonus). The fries that came with it were perfectly seasoned and crisp.   Like Raymond B. mentioned below, Chilis IS always just Chilis. The food is okay, but never very memorable. I did enjoy the iced teas though!"}
{"text":"Yummy dinner tonight. I had the margarita chicken and my son had the burger bites. He loved the new blood orange mango lemonade, we both loved the fresh pretzels !"}
{"text":"Due to the deplorable service one our veterans was subjected to, I will never eat at another chillis. The manager who insulted a black veteran should be fired."}
{"text":"I always go to this location for takeout but every time I have to wait forever for my food. I thought maybe if I paid online I could get a lesser wait time, but that's not the case. I'll pay online, show up 10 minutes AFTER my ready time, and still have to wait at least another 10 minutes when I get there for someone to give me my food. This is the 4th time this has happened, I don't think Chili's deserves another chance from me."}
{"text":"My kid wanted to go here for her birthday so that is where we went.  Jason was our server and was by far the best one we have had in a while. He was proactive and very attentive with a great personality. The food came out properly cooked and had flavor which is what one expects from a chain but doesn't always get. Definitely a great experience here."}
{"text":"Corey is our \"server\" and he is super fake. The main reason I know this is because when we were walking in he was clocking in and was adamant to let the girl (his female room partner) that he was now on.  She was the one that took our drink order, she also brought out our food and even took an order for us for fried pickles when she brought our app.  Corey was complaining in the kitchen when she let him know because our meals were already ordered, so I let him know that it didn't matter whenthe pickles came out.  He spends a lot of time trying to rack up the check but not taking care of the table. As a server, it doesn't matter how much my bill is, there is potential for a great tip.  Corey also does not know how to prebus or stop at the table when asking if the meal tastes good. I am pretty sure he is one of the servers that tjinks he will make more by having lots of tables instead of giving quality service.     If Jessica was our actual server then the rating would have been better.  She helped us more than our supposed server.    Food is Chili's, it's the same everywhere.  Not great, but not bad. Decent."}
{"text":"Went here during one of my lunch time excursions. I decided to give them another chance and see if a year or so had changed the chain. Well...  The restaurant is your typical Chili's cookie cutter interior design. If you've been to one, you've been to them all. Tables and floors were clean, especially during the lunch time rush, so I give them a thumbs up for that. We were seated fairly quickly and our server came around in an adequate amount of time.   Looking through that menu though brought back memories of 2009. I could've swore it was 2011! Oh, I am right, it is 2011. Not much has changed in their menu, except the occasional \"Tex-Mex\" item dashed throughout the menu. I opted for an easy and hopefully satisfying unlimited chili and salad for $7 something. They gave us salsa and chips to snack on while we waited for the entrees.   I am a little particular with my chili, so don't get me wrong, I know what I paid for. But anyways, it was a very average chili bowl (didn't even qualify to be a bowl, more like two hand scoops). The meat was chunks of chicken and beef, each smashed into little bits and squished into small balls and sprinkled here and there until the quota was met. I swore I only had three solid beans in there. The rest seemed to be mashed in with the runny broth. I swear Wendy's has better Chili and they're fast food! The Caesars salad was just as disappointing. CHUNKS of cheese?! You couldn't take the time to grate it out and instead left me with four slices of cheese. Really?   Service was excellent though. Always attentive and speedy. My three stars go to the food and not the waiters or staff. I know they have some good picks here and there in the menu, which is another reason why I didn't give it a one for my mediocre lunch."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this Chili's again for what we had hoped to be a nice supper. The area we were seated in was filthy. The floor hadn't been swept and many of the tables hadn't been bussed. A nice young lady got our drinks for us but it took our server Davante another 10 minutes to show up at our table and take our orders. My wife's salad arrived first. She said it was okay. Our entrees arrived about 15 minutes after the salad. She had smoked wings with ranch dressing, they arrived with barbecue sauce. I had the Ancho salmon. It was over cooked and tasteless. We had to ask the guy delivering the food to refill our drinks since Davante was too busy chatting in the kitchen to do his job. When it came time to leave he was nowhere to be found so we used the electronic check out. My wife was so displeased that she complained about the meal on the Chili's website."}
{"text":"I ordered the jumbo soft pretzels and the Bacon ranch steak quesadillas. I hope its all good. I'm sick of driving all over East Charlotte in an attempt to find something better than a 2 star restaurant and more importantly one that takes American Express. The restaurant is pretty empty. I thinly my waitress's name is Angie. The pretzels were pretty good but overpriced. The quesadillas were flavorless and filled with fatty meat. Ugh. Unfortunately with a tip included the bill was $23. That's way too much for mediocre food. The Chili's on my side of town has better food than this one does. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"So let's  see . .. My wife  complained  to  Chili's  corporate  about the poor service  and  filthy conditions  of  the  Chili's  restaurant  on Hwy 51. They sent her $25 in Chili  bucks as compensation . So we decided to use them at another Chili's  this time in Blakeney . Our server is Daniella . She was very prompt  with  our drink order and with taking our order. The watermelon  marguerita  is delicious .  Our appetizers  were hot and  flavorful . I can't  wait  to  see  what my burger  is like. Everything was very good. Daniella was very attentive and the atmosphere was worlds better than the location on highway 51."}
{"text":"We received a to go order for a smokehouse burger and we both ordered them Medium rare. When I bit into my burger it was well done and with the wrong cheese on it which lead me to believe the cook mixed up the patties during the cooking process. When I called and spoke with the manager on the phone he was the kindest and coolest person to me. He stated he was sorry and that he'd start the new one for me. It turns out he went back in the kitchen and cooked my burger to perfection. Thanks Brian for the great customer service. We will definitely be back for more of your awesome menu. The way you treated me as a customer and just another bitchy customer trying to get free food. My burger that was messed up was politely returned with a few bites nibbled out of it. The Fries were mostly demolished per my urge for hunger was so great at the time. Keep up the good work~!"}
{"text":"I have had several great experiences at this Chili's location. But, today was noteworthy. I felt like I really needed to write a review to talk about the fantastic server we had today. Her name was Patty. After being greeted in an extremely friendly manner by the hostess, we were delighted by Patty's attitude, how fun and friendly she was.  Our food came exactly as we ordered, and I generally make a lot of modifications. Not only did she stay on top of our refills, but when she sensed that we were getting ready to go,she brought us to go cups filled with our beverages, without us even asking.   Our food was good, chips were fresh, soup was hot, salad was cold... But really we enjoyed our server the most."}
{"text":"This Chili's HATES children!!  Excuse us Chili's if your kids menu does not fulfill our preschool-age child's special dietary needs, and we bring food to meet her needs.  We are two adults who pay for full dinners, appetizers, deserts, and beverages.  Not like we're bringing in a cooler of food for anyone of us!  We particularly were offended by the waitress/busgirl who wasn't even waiting on our table, but had a huuuuge problem with a child's special dietary needs.  Furthermore, we were offended by the rude (and sweaty and smelly) manager of the restaurant who was summoned to our table by the offensive waitress, and pretended not to know why he was there!  Stop acting like children, Chili's management, and treat the real children with some respect.  Every one of your about 50 competitors in a 3 minute distance has no problem with children with special diets, so I suggest you grow up!  But for us, don't worry, we will never, ever, step foot inside your door again."}
{"text":"Hey it's a chilies, same as Applebee's same as ruby Tuesday, same as Charlie's or red robin. All the same just a different name, nothing great or fancy. Just a run of the mill chain restaurant with no originality"}
{"text":"Poor service. Never was asked if food was alright nor to refill my tea. Forget paying from those machines at the table so frustrating! Food nothing spectacular actually a burger from another place would of been better. Will not return."}
{"text":"The first time I ate at this location, I ordered their chicken crispers and one of them was completely raw. It was disgusting and I kind of freaked myself out that I was going to get salmonella poisoning and die. Luckily, that didn't happen. The staff were really kind to me after that, and my food, drinks, and dessert was free. They also gave me $20 in gift certificates for the restaurant.   I've come back a few times since then and the food has always been solidly good. You can't really go wrong with Chili's. I've just refrained from ordering anything with chicken in it since then."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely  horrible,  to the service to the food. Prices are high management  and Staff slow and rude. Don't  waste  your money here!!!"}
{"text":"Decent services & good food.  Kids love coming here. Its a nice family outing, & the wait was not too long.   Most non-fancy restaurants seem to mess up on the chocolate lava dessert...but they performed it to perfection"}
{"text":"Chills really has stepped up their game over the past few years. This particular location seems to have relatively slow service. But overall the food is the bomb (I always get the same thing-mango chile chicken. ) good drinks decent prices and good atmosphere!   I probably shouldn't leave a review before I actually get the food. Multiple people had the wrong sides and chicken wasn't properly cooked :( yuck  WORSR CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EVER SEEN IN A RESTAURANT. the manager was literally horrible. Tried to make us pay for the raw chicken and then took it away and she ended up never eating anything.   Calling corporate on this particular chills. Horrible horrible experience."}
{"text":"When there Monday nite it was best service I had there Caribbean salad was was so good made want go 2 day latter just not the same service was slower"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Food was gross, staff didn't look professional or like they even tried to look decent. Just seemed really sloppy.the menu was too much, you just dont know where to start and the food doesnt even look anything like what you get. Definitely not visiting that chilies again."}
{"text":"Website was down so i could not order online and gift card machine was down so I could not use my gift card. I ordered anyways. Picked up the food and went home to find out my order was messed up.  Food was good."}
{"text":"I usually am satisfied with the food and service at This Chili's but today was a complete disappointment. I was accompanied by 10 female coworkers (on hour lunch break) to celebrate the birthday of one of them. We had been there an hour before our food was served - about 45 minutes after ordering. Our waitress only came by once to refill our drinks. It would've been appreciated if someone gave us status updates on our order - why it was taking so long, maybe apologize for the wait and thank us for waiting but NO! We asked them to bring to-go boxes when they brought them out. Some of the orders weren't fully cooked, some were satisfactory and others had gotten cold. I had ordered the boneless buffalo chicken salad - the lettuce was nearing room temperature and started to wilt, while the crispy chicken was not so crispy and cooled off. We didn't receive any apology or offer to compensate for long wait and less than pleasant experience. If they were short on staff, they should've let us know when we arrived so we could decide whether or not it was something we could wait for.  I don't think I'll rush to go back there and may disuade others from going, especially for work-lunch outings.  I'm sincerely disappointed in how the situation was handled (or not handled) by the management."}
{"text":"Very clean, organized, friendly and fun. Thanks for the respectfully service. I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"The best around! Great experience, friendly service, timely productivity. Enjoyed it very much, no bad comments, can't complain."}
{"text":"I've had breakfast here a few times before overseas flights, good enough and not airplane good, service is always good and friendly, just average food. No complaints though and o usually go here too"}
{"text":"Great service and our food came out somewhat quickly.  The two of is had the triple dipper sampler, a full rack of honey chipotle ribs, a beer, and a margarita for $54 with the tip.  Food tasted good and was presented well."}
{"text":"I came with a group of friends we were seated about 5:15 it took a whole hour before we received our appetizers which was done after we had to ask for the manager, 1 hour and 30 minutes later we were still waiting for our food, the server never once returned to the table after drinks to say what was going on, the mom and daughter sitting aside from us came after we did and got their appetizer and food before we got anything, and on top of this it wasn't crowed at all after we complained to the manager who is a heavyset guy he just said well the food is here now so what do you want me to do about it which was extremely rude and he really didn't care what kind of service we got one of his solutions was \"well you can just leave now and not worry about it at all\" one of the people in my party said to him that it was no reason to be rude and he said \"I wasn't being rude I gave you an option\" at that point we were all done and just got up to leave, me working in customer service for 5 years I would never think that a manger would be so rude and uncaring about such a situation, and I feel like part of the reason we received poor customer service is because we were young and they didn't expect us to care about service. I will never return to this location and will advice anyone I know the same"}
{"text":"I had not been here for several years and was pleased with the service after returning.  The food was very good and there were plenty of employees willing to help the moment someone at the table needed something.  I was here on a Saturday afternoon, so I can't comment on the service during peek, evening hours.  I imagine it's just fine then, though, as well."}
{"text":"This Chili's is a great place, for perfect prices! Very comfortable atmosphere, of course we sat outside. Here For Spring training, and it isn't always easy to find a place to eat, that doesn't have a super long wait. Our waitress Gloria was super sweet and helpful! Thanks Chili's for being my \"go to place\" when I'm out of town!"}
{"text":"I frequent this Chili's location a lot to meet my mother or grandmother for lunch. We are always greeted and seated right away. My grandmother uses a walker and we always get friendly assistance from staff opening doors when we enter and leave the restaurant. Also, staff always moves the walker to a different location, out of the servers and patrons way, and they always bring it back without ever having to ask or wait a few minutes.  Food and drinks are always delivered and refilled quickly. I rarely ever stray from my lunch order of the Chicken Caesar salad, but the honey lime dressing on the side instead of the Caesar dressing, and I always add avocado. The salad and avocado is always fresh and my order has never been screwed up despite how picky it might come off, yummy! The bottomless chips and salsa are so dangerous, but oh so delicious!"}
{"text":"Besides the odd smell that I encountered when I first walked in, this Chili's was pretty rad. We got seated right away and our waitress got our drink order and drinks out to us in record time. My mom and I did one of those 2 for $20 deals starting out with there ever addicting chips and salsa...its so hard to just eat only one chip! Grrr! I ordered the new grilled veggie tacos that came in a flour tortilla. I was surprised to see the amount of avocado used, bravo Chili's, way not to be skimpy! The three tacos were accompanied by white rice and black beans. My madre got the Margarita chicken tacos that were good, but really dry. I'd recommend getting sauce or salad dressing on the side. We never had to ask for a refill on our tea and the manager came around just to see how everything was. Of course I was in mid-bite, but I managed to nod my head and lose on one mushroom in the process. I love the amount of options on their menu and have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Typical chain restaurant! Quality service and pretty good food! I love to smash on the bottomless chips & salsa! Chili's has great affordable options, which is great when you're a broke college student. Lol, what's better than happy hour?!"}
{"text":"We should have read the reviews first.   My poopsikins and I LOVE Chili's. We used to go to one every weekend and enjoyed all the entrees and apps and the other great things at Chili's.   Then we moved to Charlotte. We lived right next to one and thought, \"Oh man, did we luck out!\"   Not quite.   Our first experience was \"to-go,\" as the kids say. We waited outside for close to a half hour in the designated pick up spot. I was told online to wait there. But I got tired of waiting and it turns out it had been prepped and ready to go the entire time with no warning or attempt to reach us.   Then the food was not up to par. My sandwich was #SOAKED and our southwestern egg roll order only featured two rolls.   We NATURALLY complained and were granted $20 in gift cards by corporate to give the location another try.  SO WE DID.   We sat in this time. We were seated and waited up to 10 minutes for our server to even introduce themselves and get us drinks. It's not like the place was busy on a Friday afternoon before the work rush.   THEN, heh, this is the kicker - we order the 2 for $22 and we got our entrees before our cheese fries appetizer. The cheese fries were #GROSS, dry and stale - and our entrees were not up to the high bar we hold Chili's to.   We had about four different staff at our table delivering us food and drinks and checking on us - CONFUSING. We are not ones to complain - but this experience was so subpar even after Chili's gave us this meal essentially to give them another try.  THEN we read the reviews which were disgusting. And I agreed with most of what they said. Staff didn't care, the food didn't taste right, and service was long and lousy. We waited around for almost a half hour trying to get someone to our table to use our gift cards and leave. We wanted O U T  We done there."}
{"text":"This review is mostly about the service. It was by far the Best service I had had @ a large chain in a long time. I think we all know what to expect from the food & atmosphere of a chillis by now... But the personality & attentiveness of the servers/bartender was great. Didn't even get to drink my ice tea down to the halfway point before it was topped off. Very alert & we didn't wait for anything."}
{"text":"I had one of the worst experience here. Not only did the food suck. But the customer service was awful as well. Slow. Very slow."}
{"text":"I don't review chains often nor bring my business to them, unless someone's buying. It's chilis; don't get your expectations too high. Food was what it should be, Martino was very friendly.  Fries aren't vegetarian from the oil it's cooked in; if you have an important dietary need, inform management and see if cooking separately is possible."}
{"text":"Great experience last night. Typically I go here for business meeting and always have great service. Knowing this my family and I went here yesterday for dinner. The staff was very accommodating to our large party and our server Joe made sure we were well taken care of. The check was even able to be split any way we wanted through their self pay kiosk. The menu has many options and I would definitely recommend getting the bean and quest dip as an appetizer."}
{"text":"I agree with these reviews.  This is the worst chain restaurant. It was late evening, no one in the restaurant and the staff totally ignored us and wouldn't even bother seating us. WTF indeed.  We left and will never, ever go back there. Too many other choices in Las Vegas to be treated like well, I hate to say it but none paying customers.  Now that I read the reviews, I'm actually thankful that we never got seated!"}
{"text":"If you like getting food for free, this is the place to go.  I signed  up on their website to receive coupons and special offers and they aren't stingy with their coupons.   We went to  Chili's for my husband's birthday and I had a coupon for get either an appetizer or dessert for free.  Since it was his birthday, he gets a free dessert anyways, so we ordered an appetizer.  We chose the southwest egg rolls.  That was actually my entree since there are free chips and salsa in the bar for happy hour and I filled up on those.  My husband had a burger and was satisfied.  We got to order a dessert too, but I can't seem to remember what.  I'm not a dessert person at all. Service was good, a little on the slow side, but very polite.  I love the remodel.  The place looks great!"}
{"text":"Food is what ever I mean no better no worse than any other chain restaurant. What i hate about this place is the table is always being so sticky it's gross and makes me think nothing is clean i held off the first few times here thinking it's a one off but today was the 5th time plz clean ur tables with more than just water thanks"}
{"text":"Horrible. Called to place to go order only To be hung up on. Then placed an order only to get to there to pick it up and they can't find my order I placed. Ridiculous this is the worst chili's in town"}
{"text":"if i could give 0 stars, i would. first off let me begin with I HATE COMPLAINING, i understand how hard it is to be a waiter and how annoying customers can be, i was a waitress for 5 years. but the service on Saturday 19th was ridiculous, beyond unacceptable and unprofessional on not only the waitress assigned to us but the management in charge that night. we waited 20 mins for someone to even approach us and ask for our drinks orders (2 beers, 2 sodas), we waited another 15 for our beers to be brought to us. mind you; it wasn't busy, and our server was mostly NO WHERE to be seen. We waited another 15 to have our orders to be taken, and waited around another 20ish for the food to arrive (WHICH WAS NORMAL AND FINE FOR 2 STEAK DINNERS). we still hadn't received our drinks or silverware, and waited another 10 for both. i spoke to management about the lengthy wait and lack of service, requested another beer and they proceeded to get my request wrong. i was facing the kitchen, and witnessed the manager speak to the young lady and gesture towards our table; she proceeded to not only catch a attitude, but it was NOTICED BY STAFF AND CUSTOMERS, and the staff laughed at it! What?! this is customer service! you don't get to make a customer wait repeatedly for EASY things and then catch a attitude when corrected for the amusement of your coworkers! our food was cold when served to us and our broccoli was under cooked, the steak cooked incorrect. I didn't speak on the food because by this time i was fed up. I hate sending food back, and judging from the tacky response from the wait staff, i didn't trust it.  Don't go here; unless you want to wait 1 hour for your silver ware and soda, or laughed at when you request better service."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with colleagues. I got boneless wings and fajita... and molten lava cake... wings were mentioned as fiery spice... they were no where near spice. Fajita was ok and dessert was not as good as I expected it to be.  Little disappointed"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner tonight with my girlfriend and daughter, but almost didn't because our last two experiences  were awful. Charlene was our server and started things off right. I ordered the chicken crispers and changed it up and asked for them to be tossed in barbecue sauce. She wasn't sure if they come that way, but had a can do attitude and assured us it would be done. I also asked for cheese on my fries and she took the time to explain how they make the fries and that they would come out on a side dish because they run them through the oven.        We got a nacho for an appetizer and as the manager was bringing it out Charlene was right behind him with drink refills.        When the food came, everything was hot and fresh and I liked the way she didn't run off, and asked the right questions to make sure everything was right.       There has been a noticeable upgrade in the staff at this location. My girlfriend and myself both have a background in managing restaurants and it is easy to see by looking around that some good hires were made. We will be back many more times now. Great Job Guys!"}
{"text":"There are several Chili's locations that are all about the same distance from where I live.  This location is excellent!  The Tyvola store is also very well staffed, it's nice to be remembered even if you don't always come in all the time."}
{"text":"Chilies in Mesa, Phoenix area are one of our favorite restaurants. This one off Dobson road had excellent servers!"}
{"text":"I love their lunch specials!  They are priced just right and their service has always been great.  Sign up for Chili's rewards, you'll get good free deals like free chips and salsa or a free beverage on your visit.  This place is always clean and I can really appreciate how easy it is to check out.  The pay station on the table will check you out in minutes and even print a receipt.  No need to wait for the server to bring your check.  If you have any coupons, the pay station will accept those too!  I ordered the lunch special which was 1/2 Bacon Avocado Grilled Chicken Sandwich and it was plenty big.  It also came with a side of fries.  It was very good and would definitely order again.  You also can't go wrong with the skillet queso which comes with chips.  I would compare their chips to Tostido's Cantina thin and crispy.  Soooooo good, keep 'em coming.  :)"}
{"text":"Waitress was ignorant and horrible (Heather). I had bacon ranch quesadilla, beef the beef was steak umm. Had the nachos there was like 20 chips spread out flat with melted cheese. I'll never go back it's the 3rd back experience."}
{"text":"Today is Christmas Eve and our service tonight was horrible.... They should have closed early because the bartender is extremely unpleasant."}
{"text":"My experience yesterday with the take out service was not good. There was a misunderstanding, which happens, but instead of the server/hostess being gracious and polite and trying to make a positive experience out of a misunderstanding, she acted like I was putting her out by being there. So instead of me placing another to go order, I literally just said \"never mind\" and I left.  They lost a sale, potentially a customer, and I lost hope of decent customer service.  Such a bummer. If she handled things just a little bit different, it could have been a positive experience for both of us.  Instead.. they lost a sale and another business gained it. And next time I'll reconsider going inside, like I do at least one a week. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We just came from this Chilis on Saturday April 9. It was terrible. We frequent this place about 3 times a month on average. We were there just before noon.  The women's bathroom was absolutely filthy.  The guacamole, which is usually a hit with us had that day old color and texture.  The ribs were DRY and COLD. I have a strong feeling they were left over from yesterday.  The French fries were cold also.  Saturday lunch sets the mood for the rest of the weekend. Won't be going here for many many months until we hear they have straightened this place up. Very disappointing! Doesn't even deserve the 1 star."}
{"text":"Breakfast waiting for a flight out of Las Vegas, what more could you be looking for than the offer of a Bloody Mary and a Full Breakfast with bacon, eggs and toast.  The breakfast isn't anything to shout home about but it is more than sufficient and the usual coffee refills keep coming. If you are just looking for something to fill your stomach before heading on to your next destination then it easily does the job."}
{"text":"The service is there downfall... It could use some work, I love there food, but the service does make me visit less frequently..."}
{"text":"I normally don't like chain restaurants, but my boyfriend's family do, so we ended up here for lunch. I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were definitely delicious! I also loved the idea of paying at the table with their new handy pay kiosks. Service was also good."}
{"text":"Amazing and fast service! Fair prices! They have totally revamped this location and it is lovely!"}
{"text":"OK, so it's been at least 10 years since we took our last chance on this restaurant. My hubby thought he would try the ribs. They were advertised as 'fall of the bone tender'. They weren't too bad. I would have cooked them a tad more, myself. The beer sauce is lackluster at best. I ordered a rib-eye steak that came with potatoes and broccoli. I ordered extra asparagus, as well. She came back in a bit to tell me they were out of asparagus. My waitress brought out what turned out to be a sirloin steak. It had sharp edges, as if it had been cut from a larger piece of meat. I thought, OK, well I'll try it. The taste was not that of a rib-eye. Finally, when our young waitress came back, I questioned her as to whether it 'looked' like a rib-eye, because it sure didn't taste like one. She agreed that it looked like a sirloin, but she would check on it. Yes, it was a sirloin and would I like a rib-eye. So after that, the manager came over and saw the steak. He said he liked rib-eyes, too. It came out and it looked like a pork steak of all things, pale and no browning or grill marks at all. I ordered it med-rare and it was less than 1/2\" thick. I had never seen a rib-eye so thin, except at Waffle House, and there's wasn't too bad, compared to this one. The mashed potatoes were too gooey, as it they had been beaten for 15 minutes. They came with pepper jack cheese, which  had no flavor as this type of cheese should have. It is not written on the menu that they come with cheese of any type. When I questioned the waitress about the potatoes, trying to figure out if it would be worthwhile getting a new order without the cheese, she said they made them in a big batch. I told her I thought that from the menu they would be a little more potato chunks, smashed, more than mashed. Their menu needs more critiquing. My first bite of the end of the rib-eye was a tiny piece of rubber-like consistency. No way should a rib-eye steak of any thickness be 'rubbery'. The manager was too young looking to me. I would say that the cooks do not know what they are cooking and how foods should taste. We had originally wanted something that has been recently advertised on TV, but I didn't see anything that reminded me of the ad, so we ordered something we thought we would enjoy on a Sunday night. The waitress asked me if I would like something else. I said I came for dinner and a drink, so I guess I'll just have the drink. Big disappointment. We will NEVER darken their doors again.There was really no attempt to make anything right, other than replace one steak for the correct cut of beef. Maybe being close to the mall gives them a feeling that they don't have to try to please the customer with a great product."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times, and what can you say? Food is ok, service is up and down. It does the job, Chili's is no where close to what it use to be! It was my favorite place years ago, but other chains have past it since."}
{"text":"I don't know if Chili's has gone down hill or just this location.  We were excited to go, but were pretty disappointed in the food.  Their queso looks and tastes disgusting.  They put re-fried beans in it, yuck.  Their fajitas came with a weird not traditional side display.  The sour cream was the consistency of ranch dressing and I got 17 shreds of cheese.  I just don't know how you can mess up queso and fajitas.  The service was great, but the kitchen/menu isn't."}
{"text":"This used to be a decent Chili's. Wow has it gone downhill. When we arrived we were told they had no iced tea. Really? No iced tea? Things went downhill from there. The service wasn't bad but it wasn't good. The food was bland and the servings were smaller than even just a few months ago. This place is not run well and we both agreed we wouldn't bother coming back."}
{"text":"This is for MESA RIVERVIEW CHILIS  If i could give this place 0 stars I would. We just walked in there and all the servers where standing in the server station. 2 of them saw us standing there waiting to be seated. (no sign stating It's open seating) they all just looked at us and Kept walking around. The short bartender with Glasses Saw Us as well and Didn't greet or say it's open seating or invite us to the bar. The place was NOT BUSY, maybe by their definition it was; anyway this place will never get our business again. It was our third time giving that place a try.  1st time-- The Server didn't get our order put in and took a while to bring our drinks. She was very nice so we gave it another shot.  2nd time-- we came in to watch an Eagles game and sat at the bar There was a Talk Young Caucasian Guy as our bartender. Very nice. Didn't really Talk to us much however service was decent. No mistakes.  3rd time-- No service, No Greeting, Stood there for a while Awkwardly. Everyone looked at us and Ignored us.  This place will never get our business ever again."}
{"text":"First time in a long time. Liked the quick check out with their new tablets on the tables. I even got a paper receipt. Their salads and new bowls were pretty good too."}
{"text":"The food is always good, but the servers are the absolute worst ever. They have those new tablets set up at every table and the server rely on them to do everything . I find it extremely difficult to get my servers attention each time I am here. And the food takes a long time to come out, sometimes I think they just forget about it ."}
{"text":"I had ordered a chicken salad with extra avocado, when it came out I was looking for the extra avocado, waited for the waitress to come over, forgot her name ...she said did you get your avocado, I replied well can you look and tell me where the extra avocado is at ? She apologized and brought me a tiny bit..so I just ate it and took my salad home, there was no point in bothering her since obviously asking for extra avocado is tough in Las Vegas, good thing the salad was good , will not be going back to this location, they cam charge ppl for an actual extra avocado instead of a tiny piece"}
{"text":"We've been here for nearly 2 hours. We got our appetizer, then 30 seconds later our food. The table wasn't cleaned AT ALL. They gave us dirty plates for our appetizers. My waiter is awesome which is why I'm giving 2 stars. Cleanliness is very very poor. It is a family fundraiser so it's busy, but that doesn't excuse ketchup being on plates given to us for the appetizers or a dirty table with crumbs, French fries, ketchup, straw wrappers etc. . & the hostess still sat us here. I've been coming here since I was a little one with my mom, & it has changed so much... For the worse. The menu has a wide variety, but no choices. In the guacamole burger there was 1 slice of avocado on it, not guacamole. Buns were really hard as well. My fiancée ordered a steak well done & it might as well been raw.  Stuck under my plate was a receipt for table 62, we were at table 64. Makes me question if my plate was cleaned, the cooks, the bussers, & the dish washers suck at their job, dirty dishes, dirty table, bad food.  When we talked to the manager he basically said \"oh well sucks for you\" & gave us a $20 gift card. Chris, our waiter was amazing, so kind, & tried to make up for everything that WAS NOT his fault whatsoever. Probably not going to come back to this location. It's sad to see all of these, once great, restaurants going to shit because they are hiring anyone who applies & not letting go of people who are obviously terrible at their job. That was $70 wasted."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE!  I gave this place THREE times before writing a negative review.  I ordered through Postmates initially and thought it was them.  Postamates gave me a refund after the first time.  After the second time I called Chilis directly and they gave me $45 in gift cards.  I go to use them and it takes them three times to cash me out correctly.  Then when I get home they royally messed up my wife's order.  We asked for no bean spread on the nachos and jalapeños and we get bean spread and NO Jalapeños.  How can you mess up an order this bad that is submitted to you online.  The pictures they show you online look NOTHING like what you get.  Avoid this place if you can.  They obviously have no care for their food quality after NUMEROUS attempts."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas again in three weeks.  First visit we thought it was exception and due to lunch rush. The place is messing, many dirty tables and the food service was mediocre.  The order was incorrect - lack ingredients as described. I do not recommend this location.  Perhaps, they have an indifference because if being near the strip and outlet stores - cater to the tourism."}
{"text":"The waitress Brooke was horrible. Gave us attitude as soon as she took our order, and only came by our table every 30 min., but we could see her at the back of the house talking with other staff members.   And to think that my youngest daughter picked this place to have her 18th birthday dinner.  We will never be back again."}
{"text":"Good food, clean and pleasant.  Best was wonderful waitress Kylee.  Very nice to us and even remembered my moms name after many months.  Hopefully will get her when we return!"}
{"text":"I went to this location this past weekend, and had the best experience. The host was very professional and friendly, the server was quick and on top of refills when our drinks were low, all the food was cooked perfect and restaurant was clean and tidy."}
{"text":"We always seem to get the same waiter, Gary, and surprisingly he remembers us!  Even when we come with different groups.  His service is great he's always checking on his tables.     The food is good & Gary will tell you if something hasn't been its best quality (guacamole for example).   For this restaurant to be as busy as it always is & to get this great service & food is always good"}
{"text":"Decent food at decent prices, the bar here isn't too bad either."}
{"text":"always very nice and consistent! no surprises love the positive attitudes no matter how busy!"}
{"text":"I went here with my wife to meet some family members who were in town. The short version, our waiter was completely over-whelmed. He brought us wrong drinks, wrong food, and completely forgot my food. When I finally did get to eat, it was not bad. but the service we got was completely terrible. I will probably never go here again."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Chilis, I know that I am here for a good time. And a good time I always have. The staff is always friendly and attentive, plus everything is stocked, so you can get what you want."}
{"text":"Just ate at Chili's and had a great experience. Was seated immediately and promptly and professionally served by Danielle. She recommended the lunch combo. I had a fresh house salad and delicious turkey club. The fries were old and stale tasting though. Good place for lunch"}
{"text":"First, I give kudos to our server Nicole who was very friendly and prompt with service.  Chili's fits into the applebees/bennigans/etc mode.  There are nice specials late at night.  The food is good but not great but is best Mexican option in Pottstown."}
{"text":"When you want a good meal and want to avoid the long lines at the casino restaurants and you want to save a few bucks, stop by the Chili's on the strip.  It is the basic set-up as any other chili's but I was always able to get a seat at the bar and the service was excellent.  The same food and drinks would cost me at least twice as much at a casino."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and an appetizer. The drink was great, not too strong or weak. My only complaint was that we ordered a platter with boneless wings, the wings were more like chicken strips with sauce on them. But still delicious. And the service was fine too."}
{"text":"I like the burgers here , they are very very good. Also I have the loyalty membership so I get a free drink ever time I come in . The  service is almost always very good with a few exceptions.  I come to this locations  instead of the signal butte location which is slightly closer to me because the service is better here.  Now that red Robin has made the portions smaller and raised prices of their burgers I find  Chilis is my go to  burger for a sit-down restaurant.  The only thing i really don't care for is there chips and guacamole. The guacamole  is not made fresh and they add so many other ingredients like tomatoes and onions etc it is just terrible , and the chips are also terrible.  The top 3 things I order from Chilis are 1. ALL THE BURGERS ARE GOOD the sunrise is my favorite with onion rings on the burger 2. FAJITAS  excellent quality at a good price 3. CHICKEN CRISPERS another excellent choice very nice portions   Suggestion  please do away with the cheesy lines you have your servers say when they come to greet you."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of choosing to come to Chili's on 11/04/2017. Wasn't too busy, sat in bar. Took server around 5 min to come to us to get drinks. food we ordered didn't take too long, but weren't not impressed. Ordered Santa Fe crispers salad. Salad was ridiculously small for the price of $10 something and the crispy chicken was Horrible."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. Why isn't that an option yelp?! We didn't even get to eat here because the host was so rude! He asked me how many people we had with an attitude. My husband heard him and asked if every thing was ok he said \"I'm good\" grabbed the menus, walked super fast to the table sat the menus down and walked away. Didn't say anything about a server being with us shortly, didn't ask me if I needed a high chair for my baby I was holding. Just.walked.away... so rude! So we didn't even sit down. We left. I've never experienced anything like that in my life. He should be fired!"}
{"text":"I am done with this place.  I guess it was good when I was young.   The last couple times the food has been horrible.   How do you mess up a burger.  With all the choices you have, why do go to chili's.  All my bad experiences have been at the PV location.   Advice to management, hire a chef or people who know how to cook."}
{"text":"4 Stars for CHILI'S as compared with comparable restaurants and other Chili's.  I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, but this location is close to home and has late-night hours.    Went with the family recently.  We were seated quickly and had a helpful, friendly and attentive waiter.  Drinks came out quickly and  he kept glasses full for the entire visit.  EMPHASIS on the excellent service!  The foods ordered were prepared as requested.  Everything was fresh and at the correct temperature.  One of my daughters orders a \"special\" salad that has been off the menu for years.  Her request is always accommodated, and this visit was no different.    I'm not knocking points off for high fat or salty food.  Yes, much of what they offer is that, but you know that going in.  There are other options which may be ordered that aren't high salt or high fat, so it's possible to eat here regardless of diet."}
{"text":"Simply based on our service!   Our waitress was phenomenal she had great suggestions and got things don't quickly and with a beautiful smile. her names Alincia. Ask for her!!! she is so sweet and knows how to mix a good drink! she suggested the strawberry patron margarita and it was amazing!!!! and she basically picked out my whole meal lol  she was the best waitress I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Chilis to go....very slow.....was not busy....rude workers. 15+ minutes just for pancakes. Avoid if in a rush."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN.  EVER.  Since munchies are limited in the McCaren Airport, we decided we wanted something other than fast food, and we wanted quality.  Ha...Ha...joke's on us...  This is the worst Chili's or chili's-like place I have EVER been to.  They had a limited menu (but that didn't bother me) but it was the waiting and the service that SUCKED.  We didn't think it was going to be a bad experience at first because the host guy was hysterical.  But then we were seated and we waited..and waited...and waited.  It took our waitress about 10 minutes to come by the first time.  That should have been our first clue as to how the rest of the meal was going to go.  We ordered right away, and yet we still waited about 40 minutes for our luke-warm food.  And then we asked our waitress THREE TIMES for the check.  The first time was polite, the second was more hurried, and the third time we asked for the check, I bet I was a full-out b*tch, but I don't really care.  She was terrible.  Maria, I hate to give a bad review, but you made this experience AWFUL.  PEOPLE ARE AT THE AIRPORT BECAUSE THEY HAVE PLANES TO CATCH.  You might want to keep that in mind, sweetie."}
{"text":"Chili's has always been a favorite of mine, but unfortunately my experience at this Chili's location ruined that for me.  I was seated right away, but ended up waiting a long time for my server to finally get to my table. I ordered an appetizer that ended up coming after my entree came out. I was told that my appetizer was ready a while ago but was sitting out in the kitchen because no one decided to bring it to my table. The appetizer did not taste good anyway, it tasted old, stale, and cold, probably because of how long it was sitting out.  My money was unfortunately wasted here and I will most likely not return."}
{"text":"I normally don't like to review chain restaurants, but I had great food here and didn't understand the low stars. So now I'm here to help teeter them towards at least three. No, I don't work for Chili's or anything like that, see my other reviews. The MAIN reason I go to Chili's is for the ribeye or sirloin steak. Even though I try to stray on the menu, I keep going back to the steaks.   This place by far is NOT as good as steakhouse steaks, but compared to American restaurants like TGIF, Applebee's, and those others, this place IS the best.   The Good: Been here twice and EVERY time MY food was more than delicious. The steak was cooked the way I liked, the Salmon was cooked perfectly and seasoned as though I was the one that seasoned it. The guacamole is pretty good and the Mango Tea(bottomless) should be a good choice for you if you want to avoid carbonated sugar drinks. Our first server, I think his name is Irvin or Austin... I forget, but he was VERY good and patient. We have two rambunctious kids and he seemed to not be annoyed by them(unlike their big brother). He kept checking on us, kept our drinks flowing, kept the chips coming and even hooked us up on the lil' gaming tablets.   The Bad: Our second visit, the service was off to a rocky start. The hostess seated us. We asked if the we could get another tablet to keep both our little ones busy and she obliged. Our waiter gets to the table and he looked at us like we stabbed a puppy and ate the eyeballs... \"Ummmm.... you're not supposed to have two of those. Who let you guys have those? You know it's a $1.99 fee for each right?\" he said. Now we were unaware of the charge to be honest, my wife is a \"stand my ground\" kinda person. I would've just paid the 5 bucks. She talked him into getting the charges removed from our bill.... \"But I can't do this next time, you're supposed to pay.\" After that fiasco that seemed to drag forever since I was hungry, he called my son(dressed in a blue and red Sonic the Hedgehog shirt, BLUE pants, I even called him buddy) a she.  RACIAL RANT: **NOTE TO NON-BLACK PEOPLE.... BLACK PEOPLE ALSO BRAID/CORNROW LITTLE BOYS' HAIR TOO. NO ONE CALLS YOUR SON A SHE WHEN HE HAS AN IMITATION BEIBER HAIRCUT...** After I called my son's name(a masculine name) for the third time I think he finally got the hint. When it was time to order he called him a him. Yay. Far as service goes, there was nothing else bad to report.   The Gist: I highly recommend this Chili's if you want a decent steak without steakhouse prices. Good for kids. Near the mall, food is better than Applebee's. Go when it's not busy. No military discount. Get the Mango Tea. Boys can wear cornrows too. THE GAMES ON THE TOUCHPAD ARE $1.99. YOU'VE BEEN WAAAAARRRRRNNNNEEEEDDDDD....... *ghostly voice*"}
{"text":"Bartenders not friendly.. always gone from bar.. food is good.. management must have issues.."}
{"text":"This location is very inconsistent. Sometimes the service is good and other times it's horrible. The food is the same..sometimes pretty good and sometimes horrible. On the last visit both the food and service were bad. The waiter seemed to ignore our table and when we finally got our food it looked like it had been sitting for a while. We won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"When you walk in the restaurant, the waiter welcomes you and seats you at a table almost immediately. When you are seated, the waiter gives you choices of a fair variety of drinks. The service is quick and you are served drink in a matter of a minute or two. Then you are given a choice of a wonderful variety of exquisite appetizers (their fish appetizer are extremely delicious in my opinion). Once more the service is very quick for the appetizers as well (usually 10-15 minutes depending on how crowded it is).   After the appetizers you then pick one of the many entrees. There's an entree for everybody no matter what your tastes are.  The service for the entrees is very quick usually only taking 25 to 35 minutes. If you aren't full yet, there's always a dessert for you! All of the deserts are delicious and the best part is that you can order them from the tablet the table comes with.   The dessert is especially fast for desserts that delicious. That's all I have to say about Chilli's and I hope my review helped you for the next time you go :)  Sincerely, Fiona Salas"}
{"text":"Im a big fan of chilli's. I went here twice when it opened first at this location and the service and food was truly awful. I had put it down to the place being new. I tried again this past week and nothing has changed. Floor was filthy, tables not cleaned, staff seemed more interested in gossiping then anything else. Skip this location and go to mesa or Scottsdale"}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to Chilis anytime we are looking to relax and have fun. The service is always fast and friendly. We love to get the free chips and salsa at happy hour. They are better than a mexican restaurant! The perfect accompianment is a Presidente Margarita (or two)!! Again, better than a mexican restaurant. For dinner, we stick to our favorites, a bowl of chicken enchilada or tortilla soup, quesadilla explosion salad, and their famous baby back ribs! We leave Chilis with a full tummy, a full wallet, and a smile on our faces!"}
{"text":"Felt rushed to order for our drinks. Place is located near the mall so that's why we're here! Lol truthfully we were lookin for applebees! So I hope this will be just as good wish us luck smooches"}
{"text":"Tonight we came in to the bar area to have some dinner and watch the game around 5 pm. We had a 10$ off 30 or more from email. Our waiter was the best we have ever experienced at this location, hands down!! I wish I could remember his name!   Our apps came out really quickly and our drinks were never empty. Nothing in our order was wrong. Even when I requested more tortillas for my fajitas. He was more than willing to bring more.   Before this visit, we weren't as fortunate. We were even reluctant to come in tonight, but we really wanted to watch the game and get dinner. I'm so glad we did.  He really recovered our views on this particular chilis.  I still wish I remembered his name."}
{"text":"There are some things I like, and some things I don't like.  But I'm basing my review on multiple visits.    Located in North Decatur and off the 215, Chili's isn't so hard to find.  Its basically right in the open and a few places that you'll see first, once you get off the 215 and North of Decatur.  The place is very well kept in a decent setting as well as the inside.  Whenever we went, it wasn't as busy nor crowded but it looks like it does get a lot of business.    But as far as the staff goes, some of them are nice, some of them seems to be a bit rude.  But I guess its just a matter of when you go and how busy it is.  There are times, when we sat down to eat that our waitress was on top of things.  That's what I like when it comes to good service.  But when I ordered from their To Go menu and went to pick it up.  There was some one behind the counter and I told her I'm here to pick up.  She went to the back and heard some guy yelling \"there's a sign there that says go see the bartender.\"  I wasn't sure if he was yelling at me or the person who was behind the counter.  If they said it with out being rude or yelling it out, I would of understand.  Plus there was some one behind the counter as is, and thought it would of been easier to ask the person behind the counter.  Don't know why they have a place to pick up your \"to go\" orders, when they have a small sign, that says to go see the bartender in the restaurant.  If they have camera's in the \"to go\" room, and a window where the bartender can see you.  Obviously they can see that some one may be in there to pick up an order.  Otherwise, why have a \"to go\" room, if your going to direct me to the restaurant.  I think some of the staff can be a bit more polite and friendly.  Instead of yelling in the back saying there's a sign out there that says, go see the bartender, when there's some one already at the counter.  The reason why I do like this place, is for the food.  I like their steaks, their fajita trio, crispers, shrimp and the list goes on.  Their food is really good.  I like the fact that their margaritas come in a big cup.  Unfortunately can't get a margarita to go.  But like the fact that you get more to drink, than those fancy looking glassware.    Overall, I would say its decent place to eat at.  If you go there to sit down and eat, you get one of the nice waiters/waitresses they have.  If you order \"to go\", unfortunately, my last visit wasn't really pleasant.  But be prepared to go see the bartender if the \"to go\" room is empty."}
{"text":"The customer service from the hostess is very bad .she seats who she wants and greets who she wants if she worked for me she would not have a job. Customer service is the most important part of this business and they have none lets see if the rest of this trip is better as we go"}
{"text":"If you order anything more than appetizers and expect a quality meal, you'll be somewhat let down.."}
{"text":"Oh my what an sad experience. The hostess and I use the term lightly, was like a deer in the headlights. Not organized at all. Didn't greet us, overlooked people ahead of  people. Then another employee came up and got defensive when customers complained. Rolled her eyes in plain view of customers. Poor service across the board. We waited 20 minutes for a table when there was 6 dirty tables. Crazy to see since we have eaten here for years. I work in the service industry and understand rushes but this was unbelievable. I do have to say that the food was good and our server was good enough. I really hope that our regular chili's kicks it back into gear. I'd hate to find some other place to eat."}
{"text":"Have not been to Chili's in quite a few years. Decided to stop for lunch as it was on my way home.  at 11:15 I was one of the first diners. Asked for cup of coffee which came fairly quickly but Warm but not hot.  It was apparently a bad morning. Our waitress was doing double duty as a waiter did not show up and the computers were down and had to be rebooted. Ordered a southern hamburger and onion rings. Turned out after a longish wait it was quite good.  The waitress did not  Charge for coffee as she could tell it was not hot when served. I will stop again and believe that if all of todays problems are solved they will certainly deserve at least 4stars if the food is as good as the hamburger."}
{"text":"I went in to get a to go order and when the girl actually showed to take my order she stopped me and told me she needed my phone number.  I was standing in front of her!  I explained I have never had to give my phone number to get a to go order and she gave me a snarky glance and said, well, that's what I need to take your order.  I have purchased food from that place before and NEVER did I have to give my number.  I was right there!  I wasn't just ordering food never to be heard from again!  The quality customer service approach would be to enter ANY number in so that she could take my order if the computer truly couldn't manage a take out order without it.  But she just snarked at me and I decided I was not going to give the company money when they treated me like a second class citizen.  Chili's as a company has lost my business.  Not just this store."}
{"text":"It's been a while and it will be a while again. The service is good but I just don't dig the food as it is pretty mediocre at best bar food. I did have a watermelon cooler alcoholic beverage that was really tasty. Then had the queso dip and that is always pretty good. Then we had the combo appetizer platter and it tastes like everything was microwaved; the chicken crispers were soggy not crispy, the mini sliders were just ok and the potato skins were dry. We did finish with the warm cookie skillet for dessert and that was very good. Overall, if you are looking for blah bar food, chilies is ok bit really, there is better out there."}
{"text":"Place wasn't very great. We had to wait at least ten minutes before we got service and the people who came in 5 minutes after us got served first. My corn on the cob was cold twice and the chicken tenders weren't that great either."}
{"text":"My friend asked for her brocolli to be well done and it came out almost not cooked. Waitress had an attitude. Had to ask for a refill  on our drinks 2 times. I didnt even want to tip her 20% but figured maybe she was having a bad day."}
{"text":"Great food with excellent staff, the Dr Pepper ribs are fall off the bone delish, also good is table side guacamole. Their drinks are all top notch. We love coming here.  Since moving here we have visited this s restaurant on several occasions, and were never disappointed."}
{"text":"On a Saturday night, with hardly a restaurant full, waited over 30 mins for 2 steak only to come and tell us they over cooked them and they had to resubmit our order. Manager gave us 5% comp for the delay. Waiter never came back to our table after our meal arrived. Terrible."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experience better\" is pretty much all I can say about Chili's now a days."}
{"text":"2 for $20. Guacamole, salsa and thin crispy tortilla chips included as an appetizer. Honey Chipotle crispers and Margarita Chicken are yummy. They sealed the deal with Coke Zero! Big portions. Amazing staff (shout out to the wonderful Cameo!). We love this Chili's and travel out of our way to come here because the amazing MS. Cameo makes us feel so very special.  The food is always good. This Chili's has erased our ugly memories of Apple-somethings."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the fact that I love their salad dressing, I'd probably stop going here. Maybe I need to stick to just salads!? We used to love Chili's. Yeah, I know. A chain. But seriously, that citrus balsamic dressing is da bomb.  The problem is that it's become very inconsistent. On our last two visits, at least one of our plates had clearly sat under the heat lamp for quite some time, as the plate was searing hot, and it was not a dish that may have been thrown in the oven to melt cheese or something. This time, I had some bad, brown lettuce in my salad (eew!), my daughter's ribs were incredibly dry, and yet again my husband's plate was super hot and it was clear that it had been sitting.  I want to keep coming here, but I'm just not thrilled about the current menu, and the inconsistency in service and food...I ain't doin' it."}
{"text":"Happy hour 9p to close.  $5 sangria saturdays. $5 martini fridays.  2 for $20.  Pretty good food.  I need to come here mire often.  Open till midnight"}
{"text":"I came here on my lunch break and had a great experience. I was greeted at the door and seated right away. My server was nice and friendly and I was able to have a nice meal within my lunch time! The food was fantastic as always, this location is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my visit. I usually love chili's but this location is beyond horrible! I got to chili's at 515 and I'm leaving now.... 3 hours later. Honestly you guys need to get more servers!!!! There is absolutely zero reason to sit for 3 hours when we ordered nothing out of this world. At the end our food came out cold so obviously the server wasn't paying attention to the food when it was in the line. I have an issue everytime i come here and still try to give it another chance. This was literally the last time. Save your time and money and go next door to outback!"}
{"text":"Fake five star reviews by anonymous doesn't change anything. I bet they're employees of that establishment."}
{"text":"I don't think enough people know about this Chilli's location, I stopped in for happy hour on a Monday (ends at 7:00pm on weekdays) afternoon and I was very pleased. Our bartender Vinny was very helpful with fast drinks and suggestions, we then moved to the balcony for some food. Nice view facing the cosmo looking down the strip. If you're not looking for a cheap happy hour on the strip with a nice views stop by this Chilli's location."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of chili's and having it on the strip is a great location.  I took my family here and sat on the patio.  We had a great view of the strip.  Our server was friendly and the food was awesome.  Overall the service was great i'll definitley come back.  If you live in the las vegas area or just visitng come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend bday. Food is pretty good. Messed up my order and forgot one of my orders but I want too upset.   A little slow but I would probably come here again."}
{"text":"Good food, glad they've pared down the menu. Could use a lot less stuff on it still. Always great service too."}
{"text":"The food was excellent ! The wait was long considering the amount of empty tables I saw as we sat in front of the restaurant waiting for a table.  Service was good, but we only saw our server once or twice at the most.  I can't complain to much, we had a great lunch and spent the afternoon with daughter & granddaughter!  I would recommend calling a head or getting on the no wait line.  We tried to use the table app to find our account was unable. The table app was good for checking out, made it easy and painless and no wait for server.  We will return"}
{"text":"My husband and I usually stop at this chilis when we do go. We usually don't have a bad experience, but today I went with my family and the overall experience was not good. The chips and salsa were great.. But they always are! There were not that many people on this Sunday afternoon but our server was not very attentive.. He was friendly of course but walked by us several times at a decent pace while we had empty drinks. Our food was brought out by someone different who didn't ask us if we needed anything else along with our meal. He walked away relatively quickly but he too was very friendly. Our server never came to our table after the food was served to ask how it was or if we needed anything. We had to get his attention because of course we did have a small request. My chicken was a bit too salty.. And I rarely say that because I love salt! They also had arizonas fox center playing on the tv and speaker.. Then about 25 minutes in we noticed that it was just on repeat? Not sure why but we had to listen to the entire broadcast twice. Then toward the end, a group of employees sat in the booth behind us and started talking relatively loud and cussing.. Now granted I understand I was sitting in one of the booths on the bar side my younger sister, but considering there was no one there.. I felt that it was not necessary to yell. We don't eat at chilis very often but when we do return I will consider a different location."}
{"text":"Location has been upgraded and is quite pleasant...Wings were OK, nothing to write home about...."}
{"text":"Just kind of average .... no surprises   In the land of ubiquitous sit down chains, Chilis could be considred one of the leaders if not the king. On my visit to Chilis I ordered the queso dip and chicken dippers and my friend ordered the half rack of ribs with dry rub and a side order of barbecue sauce. My chicken dippers were somewhat greasy and the queso dip just didn't taste right .  My friends ribs were tasty but not a lot of meat on them. The waitress replaced the chicken dippers and gave me the spinach dip instead of the queso, and it was good.   The meal was definitely disappointing. The best part of the meal was the service, which was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Always good food, good lunch menu, reasonable prices, sitting in the bar is perfect, tv, drinks fast service. And the bartender makes a great bloody Mary it's the perfect cure for a hangover."}
{"text":"Not one of my favorites.  Today, I stopped in  for a quick lunch at Chili's with a few colleagues. We had three people with very different ideas for lunch, so a varied menu was in order. Chili's offered just that.  The food was average as you might expect at any Chili's but satisfying and affordable. Our entrees were served quickly, the restaurant was clean, our server was accomdating. In general everything you would want from a restaurant.   I had the Sante Fe Salad, and my lunch companions had the ribs, Buffalo chicken ranch sandwich, southwestern eggrolls, and Chips & salsa.  My lunch companions enjoyed their entrée's. However, I didn't particularly care for the salad. The salad dressing had a bitter taste and the diced tomatoes just tasted odd.    The service was great, just wish the tasted better."}
{"text":"Decent food, good prices. what you would expect from a large chain. This location stands out due to the staff. We've always had great service. Very attentive and we never run out of drinks or chips. Several of the staff have been around for a while and always take a moment to come say hello to our girls."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to a Chili in years, we were very impressed with the service (Kayla was great), the food-2 for 20 deal was very filling and good, and lastly the ipad on each table, you can play trivia with other guests!  we had alot of fun and laughs because of it!!  And then were able to pay the check on it!"}
{"text":"Service is very slow.  Took over 15 minutes before our server ever came out"}
{"text":"This review is for the bar only on a Saturday night (5/21) This location is somewhat near southern highlands and my buddy suggested we meet here for a few drinks and to catch up and pre-game before we headed up to the strip to have a little fun. Service was good, the two bartenders (Jess and Tiffany) I think did a good job. They served quickly and with a smile and my drinks were relatively strong, so +1. The Well rum wasn't very tasty, but what can I expect, it's Well. Prices were good, but we were here late and on a Saturday the happy hour isn't in effect. Sucks we didn't get happy hour price but well's aren't pricey.  My buddy got some egg rolls or something, he said they were pretty good. They were supposed to close at 11 but stayed open and served us because other customers walked in at about 10:55 and ordered off the menu. Good customer service at the bar, that's all I needed.  4 nice stars."}
{"text":"This place is always great to go to my fiancé and I go here often. The food is always nice and hot when we get in the servers don't take forever to get to you, and the food is always great. There was one incident when a server neglected to pay attention to my fiancés onion allergy and brought his burger to him with onions on it even after we said no onions. Besides that time we have always had great service and an enjoyable time being there."}
{"text":"As a stand-alone restaurant, I'd probably rate this Chili's 1.5 stars. As one of the few restaurants open at 5am in the airport, my rating becomes much more generous.   The menu is decent and service is quick, that's all you really need to know. On a recent airport trip, the restaurant was full up at 5am, so they seem to be doing good business.   I had the breakfast tacos with a side of fruit. The meal came with two decently sized tacos with scrambled eggs, cheese, and salsa. I'd rate the food as \"fine\"."}
{"text":"I've come here about 3 times so far since I moved to Madison in August of 2017. Usually when I come here, I elect to get the $35 deal, which includes 2 Presidente Margaritas, an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. The Presidente Margaritas are generous servings of tequila by American standards. The servers are the bar are the best. I would highly recommend coming here to take advantage of the $35 deal. Also, Chili's supports Veterans for Veteran's Day with a free entree."}
{"text":"It has been quite some time since I was here last, a few years.  A Saturday early evening supper with my wife and a friend.  My wife was in the mood for something Mexican and ordered steak and shrimp fajitas.  The shrimp were small but plentiful and the beef tasty and tender. I thought the many many onions and the shrimp had little taste, bringing down this plate.  My friend and I both ordered 6 oz. Honey-Chipotle Shrimp & Sirloin steaks.  The meat was cooked as requested but was tough and a bit fatty.  The accompanying asparagus were woody and should have been cooked longer.  I would grade this visit 2  1/2 stars but since it must be an even number, I choose the lessor."}
{"text":"The place is awful. The service was incredibly slow when we ate at 2pm. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant so idk why everything took so long. The food came out lukewarm. My husbands side salad had rotten cucumbers in it. Our server was lazy. Never offered to refill anything. When the kiosk screen wouldn't work to pay the bill I asked him to run my card. He made it seem like a huge inconvenience. Then he never brought me a receipt for show what I was paying for, just the total that my card was run for so he could have charged me for whatever they wanted to. Won't ever step foot into another Chilis."}
{"text":"Haven't been to chili's in a while and now I remember why. My husband and myself walked in and got seated pretty fast, the people behind us were sat 5 minutes after us. The waitress didn't come over for about ten minutes to introduce herself or even ask for drink orders. When she finally took our drink order she didn't ask about appetizers which okay is fine but when it took another ten minutes to bring our drinks she said she would be right back to take our order but she didn't come back for another 15 mins. Now mind you it wasn't busy probably 4 tables of people around us. She finally took our order and it took about 25 minutes to get our appetizer, the app came out cold and the fires were soggy. Our food came out another 20 mins later and not delivered by our waitress, the manger of the kitchen dropped off our food and left. My husband ordered the shrimp and it was over cooked from sitting under the heat lamps, my burger came out but it took my fries 7 mins. The people behind us didn't get their food till we were done eating!! When we finally saw our server again it was so she could drop off our check. We paid and left not happy about how long we were there and the food was awful. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Thank you to our take out person for putting extra tomatoes in my soup and making sure my boyfriends chicken crispers were undercooked."}
{"text":"Jay Fedrick (an employee) was the name of the stand up young man who turned my bookbag in today--that I pretty much left my whole life in. I really cannot commend him enough- thank you! Murphys Law is all over me like nobody's business so I could hardly believe my luck that no one took the bookbag-  PS we've always had great service, food and drinks from this location. As good as you would ever hope for.   The table guacamole is unrivaled- the chips and salsa my favourite. The tabletop speed pay/game system is genius.  I am not in the habit of writing reviews a whole lot but I can't deny that Jay needs a shout out and also this particular restaurant has always served us well-"}
{"text":"Best Chilis in the valley and if you want the best waiter ask for Nick. We started going to this location after a bad experience at the Mesa Riverview one and thanks to Nick we decided to continue going to Chilis."}
{"text":"We go to Chilis quite often and normally it's great but I guess we caught the hostess Donnie on a bad night since asking if we could waiting for a booth pissed her off to the point she walked back up to the podium and threw the menus and walked away. If she can't handle her job put her in the kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"Have had great service in the past - staffing is clearly an issue. Waited quite a while to be greeted, then chose to sit in the bar area after seeing the dining room chaos going on.  I waited 11 minutes and was not even acknowledged so I left.   After sharing with a friend, found out they had service issues the day before.  That party had been warned that the bar area server would take up to 15 minutes before helping you. That warning came from a Chili's staff member. Yikes!"}
{"text":"Fifteen minutes waiting at the to-go window, multiple presses of the \"prompt service\" button, completely ignored by two employees who popped into the area, then a frowning staff member appears and says it will be 40 minutes to prepare any food orders. At an airport to-go window? Maybe if they had people working, it wouldn't take so long."}
{"text":"Well, we returned to Chili's.  It's not a regular spot for us.  But a good coupon goes a long way.  :-)  This is a follow-on to my last review (a year ago).  Not much has changed.  It's still adequate.  It's a chain (of course), which I mostly try to avoid in favor of smaller, family-owned joints.  The food is adequate.  Not special, but fine.  Sort of a hybrid Mexican/American/Southwest.  The service is pretty good, the staff is fine.  Not a dining destination, but a good coupon or maybe just convenience and this place is fine."}
{"text":"Service was pretty prompt and mostly friendly. The crowd wasn't a typical Friday night out the door, it was pretty sparse. Food was, well I got fajitas and they were pretty good, but the wife and a friend both got ribs and said that we can make better at home. So yeah quality has gone to the way side."}
{"text":"Great food nice atmosphere! A good chill place for my family to enjoy. Service was good and waitress was nice. I will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Try Chili's express lunch!  I get the soup, salad and chips.....all you can eat $6 bucks"}
{"text":"Service is outstanding. I ordered and unsweet iced tea a 22 oz Bud Light and as an appetizer I ordered the notorious triple Dipper with Southwest egg rolls Original Chicken Crispers and honey Chipotle boneless wings the presentation was poor the flavor was mediocre. One can assume that in most restaurants there would be a service manager in the dining room ensuring great guest service I have found including this restaurant that that is where the ball gets dropped I just saw a manager who came from the back walked up to the hostess stand did not stop at one single table did not walk the dining room but went directly back to the kitchen. Certainly a chain that Prides itself on food and service but definitely make sure that its customers are happy so far I have our into my dinner service I would give this restaurant a 2 rating. So I received my entree in a 12 ounce ribeye steamed broccoli Mexican rice and a full order of sauteed shrimp the ribeye I had to order medium to get it to medium rare what you have to do in any restaurant in Champaign the Spanish Mexican rice is real starchy no flavor very heavy this meal would have been messed complement it with maybe a nice light rice pilaf the broccoli is plain unflavored just plain broccoli probably would have been best if it was again with a garlic butter and it's more cold then then warm again the from my server is very good. The lack of foh management just goes to show where priorities lay. As I went to cut into the rest of my steak I come to find out it is overcooked. Manager came out listen to my complaint took my criticism which was constructive and has retained me as a guest I will be back."}
{"text":"Chili's is Chili's...I don't expect toooooooo much.  I've been to this location many times because it's close to home. However, this last visit cost me over $80 for 3 people, and was somehow STILL so bad that I may not go back.  We sat at a high top in the bar. It was pretty busy and we waited a long time for a server. We couldn't even touch the table bc it was still dirty so we grabbed a smelly rag from the table next to us and wiped the stuff off the table.  When the server came, she was ok. I'm a good tipper, so I ended up tipping her 20% which was like, $13 and some change. However, she was very busy and seemed like she had too many tables. She was one step behind all night. We had already paid our bill using the table machine and about 5-10 minutes later she asked if we needed anything else. We said no. She informed us that she could either bring us a bill or we could use the machine. Yep...did that a while ago. Thanks.  :)   My boyfriend and I split a ribeye steak meal and a rib meal. Each of these was around $17 I believe. TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT. I have never gotten anything besides \"fast food\" type foods at Chili's. And I never will again. For that amount I could eat a delicious juicy steak, cooked properly and with fresh sides at somewhere like Outback.  The steak was ordered medium and came out well done. Absolutely NO pink in the middle...none. The sides were bad...dry yellow broccoli, first garlic bread I've ever had that I didn't care to eat, cinnamon apples were squishy and way too sweet & goopy, old brown lime in my beer...  Worst part was after spending so much money and eating mediocre food, we both got sick. Yep...for $83, we got bad food AND diarrhea. Thanks Chili's!"}
{"text":"How often do you walk into an establishment these days and feel welcomed attended to and that everyone there does sincerely care whether or not you enjoy your experience? Most of the Chili's do embrace that culture however Tatum and Cactus goes above and beyond  John the manager has done an excellent job ensuring that customers are  well-attended too and that his Staff caters to you every need The food is always well-prepared and I've never had a bad experience give it a try"}
{"text":"Chili's, when I came here I came with friends for drinks. I had a great time, and absolutely no problems. Make sure to look on the table and check out their specials. We were lucky and got the chance and get free nachos. The drinks weren't that bad, however I personally wouldn't be a regular here just because the drinks weren't to my taste.  I had a beer and called it a day. There's not really anything memorable about this place to me, nothing that stood out. It's a chain restaurant, so I can't say much about the uniqueness of the restaurant. I do say if you do come here, order the burgers. I'm a burger lover and by no means that it's the best burger out there, but it's not bad either.  Overall, come here for drinks and burgers. That's what I would do."}
{"text":"Stopped by this particular location for a quick dinner. Now normally if it's happy hour the host or hostess will usually offer the option of sitting in the regular dining area OR being seated in the bar area to take advantage of the \"Happy Hour\" half off specials. Well yesterday I ate there this wasn't the case we had to actually ASK was it happy hour or not. Meh. That was fine. So let's get to the food. We ordered Nachos, Texas Cheese Fries, Buffalo Wings, and Southwest Eggrolls. Guess what? 2 out of the 4 dishes were AWFUL! The buffalo wings were overcooked and hardly any buffalo sauce on them and the Texas Cheese fries were also OVERCOOKED stuck to the bottom of the skillet where you had to scrape all the potatoes off the bottom and still there were some that didn't come up. The fries were dry as hell and just ugh it wasn't even worth the discounted price nor was it even worth my while to complain it was one of those things where I was too hungry to even complain. But I will NOT be choosing this particular location again for Happy Hour.. Ever.."}
{"text":"Ah, Chili's...we meet again!  Today I wanted to treat myself to a decent meal. So, in between my two 6-11 shifts , I decided to swing by.  I snuck in the back door and walked right up to the bar. Surprisingly, I was the only person sitting there at 5:00 pm...perhaps there's a decent happy hour in my future...but, I digress.  I noticed they added a special \"Chipotle\" themed section to their menu. I had every intention of examining the whole menu, but all I could see were the Chipotle Shrimp Tacos topped with avacado. How could I possibly choose anything else?  Needless to say, the tacos were FANTASTIC!!! I opted for rice and broccoli as my two sides...some feeble attempt at making this meal seem healthy.  While I was enjoying my delicious fare, I was also surrounded by nine televisions. Granted, it was a Wednesday, so there was nothing on except for baseball...disappointing, I know. Once again...keeping this in mind for future adventures.  When all was said and done, I had an awesome meal for around $15.00. And now that I think about it, I never asked for a refill on my Diet Coke, though I know I must have had quite a few.   The only logical conclusion: the bartender was a ninja."}
{"text":"Excuse me... When did Chili's get this good?! I ordered take out the other night off the 2 for $20 menu and wow! I just wasn't expecting it to be as good it was! I feel like I cheated on Applebee's because I would usually choose them before I went and found a chili's to eat at! The locations just aren't as easy to get to BUT now that I know this one is hiding in the corner off Arroyo Crossing Pkwy I just might be coming more often. The car side to go type thing worked out way better than applebee's I got pretty upset last time I visited them so Chili's it is from now on! The dishes were Cajun Chicken Pasta w/ the Chipotle chicken fingers and the SW Mac and cheese appetizer was my favorite Texas cheese fries! Yum! I got home and was in heaven! No complaints at all!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write about a chain restaurant but the service was excellent. Drinks were always filled, dirty dishes were always cleared and staff was consistently friendly. Above and beyond friendly actually... AND it was a Saturday night!   If I ever want Chili's I'll opt to drive out of the way. The thing that would make it 5 stars? A little bit of a juicer steak!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever. We ordered food to go today and when I got home it was cold. I ordered margarita grilled chicken and it was cold when I took a bite. My husband got ribs that were cold and burnt. Food was probably just sitting in the kitchen because it was all cold.  We will never order food from them again. This was the second time it has happened. Wanted to give them a second try worst decision ever!"}
{"text":"Disappointing service size. This is what happens when you ask for less ice in your Cherry Blossom Margarita.  Half the amount for FULL price. At least make me feel better and serve it in a smaller glass."}
{"text":"I'd give it less if I could. Staff condones sexual harassment and bullying. Treat others despicably. #TeamEmilyHouser"}
{"text":"I love Chilis but this one is okay. Food is meh and always have to check my food every time whenever I do to go."}
{"text":"Was a little worried because the last few yelp reviews were pretty bad, but decided to risk it! Had great service, dinner was excellent, we had potato soup and salad. Everything was wonderful, food was served on time and temperature and flavor was great. Allyson did a great job making sure our drinks were always full. The two of us got out for under 20 bucks. Good night was had by all."}
{"text":"Should you eat at this particular Chili's? Well, it's a dilemma, because Calgary's scenic Terminal C is not exactly rolling in dining choices. And the food itself is acceptably edible, particularly if you wash it down with enough day-glo margarita that you are able to ignore the vaguely nauseated afterglow from your meal.  Which is why the choice comes down to three factors: How hungry are you? How long is your flight? And do you have an aisle seat?  If you're hungry, and you have a short flight, you can chance it. If you're hungry, and you have a long flight, and you *don't* have an aisle seat, you need to think carefully about how many times you're prepared to ask your neighbour to stand up so that you can run -- not walk -- to the airplane bathroom.   It wasn't until a few hours after my Chili's meal that my digestive track started the regular, repeated pagings, so happily I was safe at home, and didn't have to bond with the WestJet bathrooms. But I sure feel sorry for any diners who eat at this restaurant before getting into a window seat on a trans- or intercontinental flight."}
{"text":"Poor overall customer service. Lots of empty tables but they refuse to seat anyone. 14 tables open and on a hour wait.  Manager is running around like she is on fire. You would think a place like this would know how to handle a dinner rush. Guess we go to another place. Could be worth a 2 minute drive to go down off of Ann rd and 95 and find somewhere down there."}
{"text":"Do everything here, but take-out for lunch. See Mary-Beth inside at the bar; she rocks.  Dining inside is always a pleasure; also, before 6 there are great \"happy hour\" specials...."}
{"text":"We went to Chili's while we were waiting for our cars oil to be changed next door.  My friend and I were sorry we did!  Service was slow and non-existent and the food was bad!  Not sure if the chain itself is going downhill or if it was just this location but very disappointed."}
{"text":"We stopped here to eat and spend some time before we had to check into our hotel room after a 3 hour drive. At first we were kinda wondering about the place because of a slightly funky smell in the air, but decided to stay.  Our waitress seemed really hurried and didn't stop for more than 10 seconds to talk to us, often speaking AS she walked past our table, half the time we didn't hear what she said. We ended up ordering our meal from a different waiter.     We ordered Monterey Chicken, which came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The Chicken and mashed potatoes were all yummy and perfect, but the broccoli wasn't nearly as good. They looked old, browning and we ended up not eating any of it once we noticed it."}
{"text":"I tried to give this place several chances In hopes I ate on the wrong nights. After ordering to go several times not once did I not seem to have food missing. And when I call to rectify the situation the manager on duty ( seems to be the same one) is extremely rude and I could go on about the food but the staff totally takes me back"}
{"text":"I go to restaurants basically daily. Corporate chains are not my first stop. However, this Chili's location has become a local area favorite. The employees and very kind, efficient, and honest. Their menu is consistent and the cooks staff makes the items like steaks and chicken to order, rather than dried out to a crisp every time. I like that Chili's is open until 10pm, which helps me since I sometimes work late.  If you go to this location, ask for Jessica-- she's the best!"}
{"text":"These guys have the BEST lower calorie low fat menu ever. Everything here is pretty good, pretty obvious other than the low calorie menu.  Nothing special about the ambiance, but you also know things will normally go well and everything will be as it should be.  Classic chain restaurant, but they do it right. Sometimes restaurants become chains because they are good at what they do."}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner at this location. Our fajitas were a little undercooked for my husband but we aren't complainers. He ate them and enjoyed them but at the end of our dinner the manager Vic came over and was absolutely amazing. He expressed he noticed body language and knew something was wrong and wanted to make sure we would come back and enjoy another meal there. He was very customer oriented and a rock star of a manager. It's not often you find great restaurant staff like that now days. Thank you so much Vic"}
{"text":"We live across the street and love chilis. Both of us worked for the company for 5 years. This chilis has the RUDEST employees and management that I have ever seen in a restaurant. The cooks NEVER cook the food correctly. The last two times that we reluctantly ate there, we had to send EVERYTHING back only to have the manager come out and give us a smart attitude as though we were requesting a five star meal instead of a rare steak. Needless to say, after several chances, we will NOT be doing business there any longer. The drive to Huntersville chilis for a good steak is well worth it."}
{"text":"I tend to review restaurants based on their category in my mind.  So, this is a 5 star experience at a chain restaurant.  I'm not overly generous with chains, but this Chili's is exceptional and should be recognized as being such!  This place clearly has great leadership.  From the hostesses to the server to the manager to the random server in the bar who yelled, \"Have a great night, folks!\" as we were leaving... All seemed focused on making us feel welcome and making sure our food was prepared perfectly and our service was seamless.  Cleanliness matters to me.  This place was spotless from the bathrooms to the tables and booths to the menus, themselves.  Sometimes, the restaurants that sit along a stretch of an interstate can let things slide (knowing many patrons are just passing through anyway).  This place truly is run as if it is the neighborhood place that depends on return business for survival.  I gave them an extra star here just for being well-run and clean.  Grime distracts me from my meal, so it matters.  Our food was delicious, and we are on a strict diet protocol where we can't eat a lot.  We had a combo with steak and margherita chicken.  We swapped about the potatoes for more steamed broccoli and split the meal.  They didn't seem to mind us sharing, either.  The flavors were very good.  I like that they wait while you check your steak for correct doneness.  Mine wasn't and they whisked it away to fix it and then brought me back my side dish so I could eat with my dinner date.  The steak came back perfectly cooked, followed by the manager to check on us and apologize.  I eat at a lot of fancy-shmancy steak places in my work travels and have sat for 20 minutes or more watching others eat when the kitchen slips up and overcooks my steak and the snooty waiters begrudgingly take it back to the chef...  That always infuriates me.  This Chili's, of all places, has more hospitality intelligence than most high-end places.  Sometimes, it is what a restaurant does to fix their errors that gives a better indication of their commitment to you as a customer than you can learn from just eating a meal that goes without a hiccup.  Bottom line: If you are traveling on I-17 between Phoenix and Northern cities in Arizona, plan to stop and eat here.  You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat when we come up to visit family. We always sit in the bar for happy hour. Everything I have tried tastes great. The last time we went their systems were down and they still got everything to us I  a timely manner."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight with my family. It wouldn't hurt the hostesses to learn how to smile now and then.  The food was good and our waiter was polite and friendly.  Everything was a bit slow tonight. Wait time for a seat was about 20 minutes. Fortunately the time spent waiting for our food passed quickly as we spent the time catching up with the family we hadn't seen in awhile."}
{"text":"I ate here a couple weeks ago. Almost forgot to Yelp it. Guess that shows how memorable it was.  It struck me as a typical chain restaurant. The food was bland and unmemorable as was the staff.  Would I return? I suppose so. Nothing special here but it'll do for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I have to admit...for some reason I really like Chili's. Out of all the similar American chain restaurants, Chili's is my fave.  I was tempted by all the bad choices on the menu, but somehow I was able to be good and ordered the Guiltless Chicken Sandwich. It was surprisingly decent, but I'm sure no comparison to say, those buffalo chicken sliders with fries and onion strings. No that I would know. My sandwich came with some pretty good black beans that tasted barbeque-y and broccoli that was seriously good. I wonder what they put on it... probably FAT. Just kidding. Sorta.  Anyhoo, it was pretty busy at lunchtime so we sat at the bar and the poor waiter dude looked kinda overwhelmed so service was a little lacking. But other than that, just your typical Chili's."}
{"text":"I am amazed I am leaving one star. I will give them a star for the 2 for 20 deal. It's a decent deal for two people. Now, don't get me wrong, I understand this is a corporate restaurant that is more franchise like. I did not expect a Chef Ramsay meal, but I still hoped for something flavorful, and at least a clean restaurant and for service to be present. I heard that kids eat free on Mondays, Great! My toddler loves to eat and this was something that made me decide to go try it out. She was recovering from being sick, we all wanted somewhere casual to eat. I called first because I didn't want any confusion when I arrived. The hostess (I am assuming. I suppose it could have been a bartender or server) answered and said she would check (with her manager) and get back to me. She came back on the phone and said yes, kids eat free with an adult purchase not only on Mondays but also Tuesdays and Wednesdays as well. Great. We drove over, arriving to eat about 15-20 minutes later. Ok, so let me say I am not a health inspector or the Queen of England, but a big red flag that made me want to turn around immediately was when we walked up to the doors and both the outside and inside doors and walls had dirty fingerprints all over them, dirt, and dried food. They were not busy inside, there were maybe 4 other tables with guests. We were seated. The booth was sure to great me dirty as well. ..and my silverware.. you guessed it. Not clean in appearance. I told my husband I wasn't so sure I wanted to stay. He wanted to. A server (young man) greeted us and asked what we wanted to drink. I asked him (again to confirm) about the kids eat free deal, as we looked over the menu. He looked totally confused and said he doesn't know. I asked if he could find out. He asked another server. She said she does not know and isnt sure. They asked what if we were ready to order. I kindly asked if they could find out for me. They went and asked their manager and came back to report the manager said \"no\". I stated I JUST called and it was confirmed, not only for today but for 3 days. \"um. do you know who you talked to?\" then they just stood there awkward. One server went back to talk to the manager again and came back and said the manager said he has to have a code or number. The manager hid in the back and never came out once during this. I asked for a minute. They hovered. I told my husband with the service and overall cleanliness I wasn't too sure about staying and since we are all going to buy meals anyways I would rather try somewhere I know we love. He did not want to leave, as he was hungry. Fine. We decided to order an app and some entrees. I ordered the char grilled steak. (It was to come with asparagus, cherry tomatoes, homestyle fries, and a sauce side). Well let me tell you, my steak came out and was not \"char grilled\". My sides were cold microwaved broccoli, and mashed potatoes (if you want to call them that. and I love mashed potatoes. I couldn't force them down, my daughter wouldn't eat them). I am assuming the server brought the wrong dish or the wrong sides. No one came back to check how the meal was. I only saw someone come over to ask if we wanted to pay via regular check or at the table. She did ask if we wanted dessert. I am not sure where the first server we had ever went. I guess it was a team serving effort but it was confusing overall. I don't think I am asking much for a manager to honor his word, the dining experience to be pleasant in service, appearance, and to have food that tastes good."}
{"text":"My and the boyfriend come here just for the artichoke spinach dip and triple supper appetizer which is soo good. Otherwise service could use so work barley came back to the table but she was nice."}
{"text":"Underwhelming is a good word to use for the visit tonight.  The food was good but I've had better at other Chili's in other parts of town.  Service was disappointing.  Waitress although there for years in one comment was not exactly sure what all was in the menu.  Food wait was acceptable.  No drink refills.  Grabbed another waiter to get additional napkins and condiments.  Almost walked out as could not get the Waitress to run the credit-card for the bill.  I was going to grab a manager and see if they could help instead and that finally caught their attention. Pointless to make a return trip to this location upcoming.  There are a lot of other restaurants in the vicinity..."}
{"text":"I have come to this Chili's on multiple occasions mainly for lunch with co-workers and have always had a pleasant experience with food and service but last (June 29) night my girlfriends and I decided we wanted to grab a burger so we decided to go in we sat in the bar as we normally do, our server was a pleasant little lady (not very helpful and very forgetful though). We ordered the orange margaritas that were on special and we were sitting in the booth close to the bar as we watched the bar tender ignore the ticket for a few minutes because she was talking.. finally (doing her job) she makes our drinks now at any other Establishment that we have been to when a bar tender is not busy and the server is they normally run the drinks instead of watching them sit there. Well this bar tender did not. She made out drinks and went right back to talking as we watched them sit there for over a good 5 minutes. Finally a server looks at the ticket and brings them over as again the bar tender is still talking to the server with long hair. Two out of three burgers came out cold and well done not how we asked them to cook it but we sucked it up and ate it because of how long we had been sitting there. Overall this was not an enjoyable dinner and we will only be returning for lunches from now on maybe in the future we will try dinner again and hope the servers and bar tenders are all less chatty and doing their job while they are working. I hope a training course for the staff will be helpful."}
{"text":"Not one to rant and rave about corporate restaurants but this one in particular has done me right every time I've been. The bar staff is always smiling and polite, whether lunch or dinner, and my food has yet to disappoint me. Management even goes out of their way to ask how everything is which usually never happens in a turn and burn atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of my favorite locations. Server was friendly and prompt I can't remember her name but she had short blonde hair and glasses I think? But anyways, service the best food hot and fresh everytime!"}
{"text":"Went to this Chili's and had Robert as our server!   He was amazing and helped us wit our choices.   The 2 for $22 was an awesome deal.   Don't forget to ask for Robert!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but terrible service. Adolf was a rude waiter that called me a liar and had me wait more than an hour to get my food. He deserves to be fired. It would make Chili's a much better eating establishment."}
{"text":"The food was good, I got a large portion and it was really good, BUT our was waiter was really bad. The device was horrendous and the wait time was ridiculous. It wasn't even full. Quick tip; switch out your waiter if his name is Hector."}
{"text":"Well, for an airport Chili's it wasn't that bad.  I was with 2 other co-workers and we had some time before our flights so we wanted a place to sit down.  We were all starving but nobody came close to finishing their food.  The service was decent at best, although the woman was trying her best.  Next time I'll grab something else and sit in the smoking lounge and eat it there!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour and friendly service. Have been here many many many times and never had anything to complain about. I love the chips and salsa and the enchiladas. They also have particularly good steamed broccoli.   Drinks are a bit pricey if you go for the top shelf, but with it being happy hour, you can get a pretty good deal. Great place for afterwork friends to mingle and relax after a crazy day in the IT world.   Actually kind of miss it since I have moved out of Arizona. I know that my friends still hang there though and that means it can't be bad."}
{"text":"Absolutely DISGUSTING! Shrimp fajitas made in conveyer belt oven now HORRIBLE! Cajun pasta was Viola' from Walmart I'm certain of it and the \"chicken\" on the pasta definitely man made! Will NEVER return to ANY CHILI'S"}
{"text":"FAIL.   Normally, the words \"Let's go to Chili's on the strip for dinner tonight\" would not be something that would EVER come out of my mouth. But it did and I am sorry for it.  My wife and I received a $25 gift card to Chili's. That is the only reason we decided to eat there on our date night.  When we arrived, we saw that they had an outdoor patio overlooking the strip. Awesome. Maybe this was not going to be so bad afterall, I thought. And hey, we had been walking the strip sipping drinks for an hour already, and I needed to take a leak.   There was a friendly enough girl at the hostess stand. We asked to be seated outside on the patio where it seems most everyone else must have been sitting because the place was empty inside. She said \"no problem\" and walked us to a table that was on the patio, but not overlooking the strip. We wanted to people watch so we asked if we could get a seat overlooking the strip. There were plenty of open tables that had not been cleaned yet. She did the eye roll and said \"ok\". Maybe they were short on staff, I don't know, but all those dirty tables in the prime table location? Off she went to get someone to clean a table for us, so we could sit and have our view. The famous Chili's Las Vegas Strip view?! Yee haw.  I took this opportunity to find the bathroom. When I came back, my wife said they cleared off a table at the end of the patio, backed by a huge wall. Half the view blocked. Why they decided to clear that table and not one of the other 5 that had awesome views, I have no idea. But my wife asked if we could have one of the better tables in the center, that were empty and needed to be cleaned. The girl gave her famous eye roll once again, and just walked away.   After standing awkwardly for 5 min waiting to see if the requested table would be cleaned off for us, nobody came. So we did the walk of shame to the table they cleaned for us and sat down. And we waited. And waited. And waited. Nobody looked at us. Nobody came over to us. We just sat there, waiting.  After maybe 10 minutes of awkward waiting, I said we should just leave. We got up and walked out of the place. We walked passed the eye roller at the hostess stand, and she was all happy and smiling. She said, \"thank you for coming\". I really think she thought we had eaten already and we happy customers leaving a nice experience. Uh, nope.  All I can say is this place is painful. What a joke of a restaurant. Are all Chili's like this? I threw the $25 gift certificate in the trash."}
{"text":"Brought the family in Monday for dinner around 630p and was seated in the bar area. The hostess was nice... but that is all I can review since no one approached us after that. As we waited, I signed up for their rewards program that the hostess notified us about and since we were all hungry(half of us borderline hangry)it didn't take long to decide what we were ordering... we waited for at least 20 minutes. During this time we saw 2 different servers (and possibly one food runner) and no one ever acknowledged us. Both my husband and I are in the service industry and a simple acknowledgement buys a server a few more minutes of time to catch up. With that in mind, minus the bar top, the seated bar area WAS NOT BUSY. These servers were leisurely making their way to their tables serving single cocktails here and there(tables right next to us). One server even cleaned the table that left shortly after we sat which that was located right next to us and nothing. Like I said after waiting at least 20 minutes and no acknowledgement, we left. I don't know if the A team wasn't in or they need to schedule more servers but I know we left with a bad taste in our mouth--well no taste since we weren't served anything."}
{"text":"We stopped in here Friday night (hadn't been to Chili's in years) and were very surprised. The menu is better than of old (although I wish they woulda kept the Chili's Cheesesteak), the interior décor is nicer, and the options are more varied. Our server (Nick was his name IIRC) was super courteous, very fast with our drinks, and just very pleasant to be around. In fact, he was one of the best waiters Ive EVER had. Major kudos! I ordered the classic bacon cheeseburger, my son the guacamole burger, and the wife the southwest egg rolls. All were cooked perfectly and very tasty. This location was also very clean, even though it was busy. Ill definitely be back again as Chili's is back on my radar!"}
{"text":"Been a Chili's goer for years.  This is the WORST Chili's I've ever been to.  Service sucks, Curbside ToGo sucks, food is always lukewarm at best.  There's literally nothing about this location that falls in line with the brand, other than the menu.  Been there on busy days and they can't handle the amount of people.  Been there on slow days, where it's not unusual to wait 30-40 minutes to be seated, then end up with zero drink refills and food that's cold, and half the time missing essential items.  Curbside is slow, and we have always ended up just walking in to pick it up.  That's if it's actually open...normally you walk in and there's a sign telling you to go to the overpacked bar.   The managers need to relearn their jobs, or be replaced.  Where's the DM or GM for this restaurant?  Do they even have those roles over their area?  Are they even checking this place out on a regular basis?   Very disappointing location...sucks it's the only Chili's in this town."}
{"text":"We have a love/hate relationship with Chili's, we come here a couple of times, then we have a terrible experience and we stop coming here for a while... until it is long enough and the cycle starts all over again.  This time we had a good experience. Our server made all the difference, he was a kind of serious and extremely polite young man. He took really good care of us, I am not sure about his name, I think it may be Ted.  Hubby had the fajitas and there were very good and tasty. He added cheese, and our server explained there was an extra charge for it. That is something that I always appreciate.  I told him I was very thirsty and my glass was never empty. He was also very accommodating to my low ice/no ice requests."}
{"text":"We have dined at several Chili's restaurants and the visits are always just average..... We are never disappointed, but we are never blown away either. This visit was no exception. I was very happy with my meal and drink, the Mr thought his was just so so. He had the Chicken Ranch Sand which with Avocado added. I had the Smothered Smoked Chicken Burrito and thought it was very delicious. It was also huge and I took half home and it heated up great the next day too. The berry margaritas are really great too - I ordered the Triple Berry this time and on another visit the Pineapple Blueberry - both really great. And just like other reviews you will notice I only have pictures of the drinks..... I dig right into the food when it comes and forget photos! Sorry"}
{"text":"Never liked Chili's but saw they had a new menu so.....I decided to get take-out.  Steak and salmon combo, loaded mashed potatoes. Service and atmosphere were nice.  Even had a cool game pad. 99 cents all you can play!    Food Salmon-very good, really liked the sauce on the fish Loaded mashed potatoes-  didn't taste freshly made, not a big fan of this type anyway. Steak-the worst.  I've never tasted steak like this, the meat was cooked to order but had zero flavor, so odd.  I had to drown it in steak sauce just for some flavor"}
{"text":"Seriously just not a good experience, the server did not come back to our table one time. We didn't get any drink refills. It was my best friends birthday and I had her daughter tell the server it was her birthday because I honestly thought they would surprise her with maybe a candle or maybe two of them would come out singing ... something ... instead they sent one man out with a single scoop of ice cream and he stated with the most blank face \" i heard it was someones birthday\" i even had her daughter tell them i would pay extra for whatever just to put it on the bill smh. I would have come out singing and it would have been way better!! Thanks Chilis, we won't ever be coming here again. Maybe you should possibly consider getting some candles for birthdays!"}
{"text":"Hector and Jake were our servers tonight and they were awesome!  Food was served hot and fresh with some allergies at the table they had to work around.  Didn't have to wait too long.  Thanks for a great experience after a long travel day.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Waiter got snotty when I asked to take back the cold enchiladas that were cold because he was helping an old couple figure out the pay at the table machine for 10 minutes! Talked to the manager who didn't do anything. Not making it right what so ever. So I payed it forward by not leaving a tip. Horrible experience! Wont be eating at that Chili's EVER AGAIN! Subpar food and wait staff, including a manager that cleary don't take care of his customers or fire his wait staff for being snobby to the customers! What happened to the customer is always right? Sorry excuse for a restaurant."}
{"text":"I gave them 1 star Just cause they do not have a no stars!!! I am not that picky and always tip well. BUT when you order food and they just screw it up so badly and don't give you half the meal and when you call the ditzy girl with a 12 year old mentality says \"ohhh ya I saw that when you walked out and realized I did not give you half your meal , ha. Ya wants come back and get it??\"    So she is that dumb that she could not add 1+1 and go I think I should maybe call the customer ,   daaaa!!!  Anyways lots of great restaurants in Vegas , skip this place."}
{"text":"Is a total drag that this restaurant doesn't take a coupon that expired 4 days ago! I'm NEVER going back again!!"}
{"text":"As always Vanessa never ceases to amaze me! I have been coming to this location for a long time and she always has a smile on her face. Ask for her and you will get amazing service! The queso appetizer is always good and I tried the turkey avocado sandwich for the first time which was surprisingly good. If you want steak the house sirloin never disappoints me."}
{"text":"Not offensively bad, but there are too many good restaurants in Madison to waste your time on a mediocre at best chain like Chili's. Better restaurants on the West Side. Heck, better restaurants at the same mall: If you're considering Chili's, go to Granite City instead.  It's also unforgivable (well, almost...I'll expand on this when I review the Dane) to be a bar and grill with lousy fries."}
{"text":"I love Chili's.  Since this is a chain, I won't really comment too much on the food.  Our server was ok.  We were seated quickly and our waitress was pretty attentive up front.  My mom and I were initially the only ones at the table.  My dad unexpectedly dropped by between us ordering and our food coming.  I don't think the waitress even noticed and took a while to come over and refill our drinks and offer my dad something.    The food itself was good and prepared as you'd expect.  It was served hot and everything was good with that portion of the meal.  Once we got the food the server seemed to be more attentive and was quick about bringing me more tortillas for my fajitas.    Overall, it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar on a Sunday afternoon. I was very disappointed in this Chilis. The service was very slow. We ordered their signature burgers, ultimate bacon, sunrise, and sliders. All were greasy, tasteless, and the bacon was rubbery. Had to repeatedly get attention of bartender for napkins, utensils, and refills. My wife and her friends say it is not normally like this, but I will not be back. My summary would be undertrained and understaffed."}
{"text":"We always give second chances, so this was our second trip to this location. First trip was a dine in about 2 months ago and we just ordered \"to go\" for dinner tonight. When did Chilis food get this bad? I remember fresh, appealing food from Chilis and now, having encountered the same issue both trips, we received old, cold, and just downright gross looking food. Bacon cheeseburger tasted old, cold, and very greasy. Texas cheese fries appetizer was old, soggy, and cold fries all fused together is some kind of sad forbidden abomination. My wife's steak was over cooked, supposed to be medium well, and had a patch of extreme salt in the middle that rivaled the Dead Sea; as if the cook wasn't aware that you must sprinkle seasoning evenly over the steak, not just pile it in one spot. I can't believe this location even has 3 stars being in the arrowhead area, I guess when you serve bad food long enough, customers forget what it was supposed to taste like. The end."}
{"text":"Hungry and tired, stopped here for dinner. Sat in bar, table was immediately and apologetically wiped down. Waiter arrived quickly and took drink order. Dinner soon followed. Steak portion was tough and pretty much inedible. We notified our waiter who in turn notified the General Manager Alex who promptly came to our table to make sure we were properly taken care of. Offered us a fresh piece of steak or dessert to compensate for the tough meat. Personally delivered the dessert and again offered his apologies.  Customer service at its best- will definitely return here again! Thanks Alex for making us feel important"}
{"text":"Chili's has been one of our go to places.  Tonight has changed that.  We arrived before the evening rush and were seated immediately.  We placed our order and got our drinks quickly.  It was downhill all the way from here.  It took an hour to get our food.  During that time the waitress didn't stop by to let us know what was taking so long, nor did the manager who passed our table several times.  When we finally got our food, my sirloin was covered with the garlic butter even though I had ordered it with no seasonings at all.  My husband's Chicken Crispers had been reheated, his corn on the cob was nearly cold and he had to wait on the fries.  He had to ask a second time for the fries and when received they were covered in salt which he specifically asked for no salt.    We noticed that very few meals were coming out of the kitchen and not many appetizers either.  We can only imagine what was going on.  I watched groups of people wait for tables nearly as long as we waited for food.    The manager did deduct $8.00 from the cost of my meal.  While I appreciate it, I would much rather have received my food on time and prepared as requested.  If that wasn't possible, then I would have appreciated being acknowledged that things were slow in the kitchen.    If you have small children I wouldn't recommend Chili's.  The waiting time could be more than they could handle."}
{"text":"My wife used to work at Chili's throughout high school so we come to Chili's alot. We absolutly LOVE the queso dip. We come to Chili's anytime we are craving some chips and queso!  We have always had a great time with the staff every time that we've came into this location.   We have our go to meals here and some other meals ehhh, not so much, but with Chili's you always know that your food and service will always be very consistent. Hats off to Chili's corporate for providing the consistency for your customers!"}
{"text":"Great service. Went on a Sunday, so it was somewhat busy. They had what's called Ziosk... It's like a personal Kiosk at each table. You can play games, reorder drinks, pay your bill, and my favorite you can see your current bill and monitor your spending. Our waiter Caleb was very polite well mannered and efficient.   The meat on the build your fajita was a little skimpy. The black berry lemonade is very good. Will certainly go back again for more dining."}
{"text":"Love stopping by here for lunch during the week. Plus very close to my office. Always great service and the food is awesome. You have to try the white spinach queso. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Ok it's standard chili's cuisine so I definitely moderated my expectations!  The service was pretty good, the bar tender was handling all of the tables left in the resturant as well as the bar.  I haven't ate at a chili's in a decade so I went with what was popular from then and of course that was the steak fajitas. The steak was decent however I wish the veggies had been cooked a bit longer. The rice was a little underwhelming on the side, however the beans was on point.   Also had the chipotle chicken crisper which came out hot and tasty. The corn on the cob and fries on the side was also on point.   Lastly let's not forget this was a dinner for two for only 30 bucks!"}
{"text":"I was waiting for my early flight to go back home to Hawaii and while perusing the breakfast menu, the woman next to me started a conversation with me that began with, \"You must love Zappos.com?\"  She must've seen my Zappos carry on and jacket.  :)  That turned into a long conversation about the company I work for then it segued into our travels. Turns out she been to many places I've traveled to and we shared our stories and opinions.  During the midst of all this conversation, the waitress was like a ninja. Brought me tea, ordered when it was appropriate.  I totally forgot to take a pic of my omelette and homestyle fries, but it was amazing and hit the spot!  I the place was probably half full with other single travelers but, I feel Chili's located inside an airport is another great connecting place for people to meet and build new relationships.  :)"}
{"text":"So 8.20.16 at 430 pm three adults were looking to go and have late lunch early dinner at chili's. We waited 4 minutes at the front for any employee to greet us. Once seated it was 15 minutes and still no one came to even take drink order. Others around us had empty drinks and no food. We left when we still could not get The attention of two employees sitting folding napkins nor did the waitress on the next table give us a moment of her time. We never saw a manager. We left. Drove 15 minutes away to Baja joes had great service and meal. Sorry Chilis you have gone down hill in the last 7 years we have frequented this location. If i could choose zero stars that would be correct."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday afternoon with my wife  The server did a nice job but we had issues with our food. My wife's food came out luke warm and I ordered a burger that was suppose to have bar-b-que sauce but was dry The food was just ok  I won't be back to this restaurant"}
{"text":"I love Chili's ! I love the new menu, there is always something to suit any appetite whether your a picky eater or just want a simple salad.  I am not a social drinker, but appreciate a good margarita from time to time.  Sooo, I indulged in a cherry blast margarita.  It was good! I am excited to see they have my favorite watermelon margaritas too. I had a steak dinner with loaded mashed potatoes and broccoli! Sooo good and filling. Also our table enjoyed chips with salsa and guacamole. It was also delicious!!! I highly recommend it all!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a happy hour frozen classic  margarita ($5.00) which was EXTREMELY tart which means there wasn't enough alcohol in it.   My husband had 2 Blue Moons draft beers during happy hour ($4.00 each).  I ordered chicken tacos with fries from the lunch menu. This came with choice of salad, chili or soup for just $8.00.  I had the enchilada soup which was excellent. The chicken tacos were very flavorful. My husband ordered from the regular menu and had a cup of chili ($3.29 with entree) and the big mouth bites ($10.19) which were sliders (4 of them) with fries. All was good. Service was friendly and very efficient. All this for $37.00!!"}
{"text":"We used to go there all the time. I loved this place. We slowly stopped going here due to things not coming back to our table like they should, empty drinks even with requests for refill, bathrooms were just out of shape, smaller portions on their salads. Then the deciding factor was one night waiting for a table, watching cockroaches run around the host table, up the back of a table and down on the cushion in on of the seats. The hostess saw, shook it off and said \"these guys are everywhere in here\" Ummm, peace out!"}
{"text":"I ordered carry out fajitas from them over a month ago. They put meat and fajita veggies in a box and forgot the rest of the ingredients. I called and spoke to a manager who got my address and apologized, promising to send me a gift card which NEVER ARRIVED."}
{"text":"I've read other reviews that talked about bad service and this location being dirty. I did find either. It was as clean as any other. Not perfect but not unclean. We also had very good service. Don't stay away. Some people just can't be pleased."}
{"text":"This chilis is not good! The only reason I gave it two stars was for the halfway decent Texas cheese fries. My husband and I went here last night and got a to go order spending about $70:   Crispy Asparagus- asparagus overcooked, limp, not crispy, not flavorful and extremely Soggy    Ultimate Bacon Burger- asked for the sauce all on the side, there was spicy buffalo sauce all over it. When I was picking up I heard one of the gals working in the kitchen say \"They don't want the spicy Buffalo sauce on it?! Bastards\". I assumed she understood that meant no sauce on it and on the side as clearly indicated when ordering however it was still all over the burger.   Trio Fajitas combo- Shrimp & Double Chicken. This really seemed like the double fajitas platter considering the amount of meat they provided. The shrimp was good, the chicken was mediocre and the corn tortillas were completely broken with an overwhelming amount of onions and little peppers.  The food quality is not what it once was and there was an extremely long wait picking up. I hate leaving negative reviews but it is very disappointing when this place used to once be good."}
{"text":"I had the Smothered chicken burrito and my wife had the smoked chicken quesadillas. My Burrito was excellent. Full of white meat chicken. Great Long Island Tea too. Priced right clean and fairly quiet. Haven't been to Chili's in a year or so and I don't remember their menu being so full of delicious looking entree's"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Chili's in forever and I would probably never visit one in CA due to the many options to choose from. However, staying in Tempe for a convention, this place was a good of a choice as one can have.   I got the steak from the lighter fare option and it came with a tomato salad. It was tasty and a good price.  However, the food took over 40 minutes to get to us and they were apologetic."}
{"text":"The yelp waitlist feature worked great, and we were seated as soon as we arrived! Food and service was great. Love their chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and always have amazing service. Food is as good as typical chili's gets. I will continue to come."}
{"text":"Chili's is one of those chain restaurants that does it right.  And I have been to this location a few times, and it doesn't disappoint.  I normally sit at the bar and the service is always good and friendly.  Between them and Five Guys, I can't decide which one has the best chain burger and fries.  But they also have great Fajitas and Chicken Fried Steak.  I wish they still had the Guiltless Chicken Platter and the Sweet Corn Soup.  It is good deal for what you get.  And the atmosphere is very good.  I wish they'd put a location on Stephanie Street in Henderson, where a lot of other decent chain places are."}
{"text":"Well, I am absolutely 100%, totally done with this location.   I reviewed this restaurant over a year ago and the management assured me they corrected all their issues and they even sent me gift cards asking me to come back (which I still have).  However last night at work, we decided to order  from here again.  I was leery, but I figured I would try it again.   I ordered the Crispy Chicken Crispers with corn on the cob, fries and house-made ranch dressing.  Well, when the food arrived at work,  I got mine opened it and the first thing I noticed that there was nothing \"crisp\" about these \"crispers\".  The breading was more like KFC's Original Recipe Breading.  Now, I actually prefer that, so that was not the deal breaker.  The first one I ate, I could only eat part of it, simply because the other part was fat or gristle.  That wasn't even the worst part.   I could not eat the rest of them, because the others were partially raw.  One of them was nothing but fat or gristle.  So, I essentially had corn, fries, and house-made ranch for dinner, which there was nothing wrong with any of that stuff.  However, raw chicken can kill people.  Chicken needs to be cooked thoroughly.  I've never had an issue with chicken there.  As a matter of fact, what I wanted to get originally was their Grilled Chicken Sandwich, which once again, they changed their menu and took off ANOTHER dish that I always got there.  I am totally done eating at Chili's.  I will use the gift cards either for drinking purposes or I'll re-gift them to someone else.  I refuse to have yet another disappointing meal or even a meal that might kill me.  Truly awful."}
{"text":"The place was empty at 8 on a Sunday night. The food was lousy,and the service was very slow. Second try for this place,and it's even worse than last time."}
{"text":"Yea, I can't believe that I'm giving an airport restaurant 4 stars either.  This is solely based upon my wife and I having breakfast there after missing our flight.  Of course, we were both famished, so maybe it tasted better than it really was.  Regardless, we both got breakfast platters; one with pancakes and one with toast.  The sausage was very good, the eggs cooked just right and the breakfast potato's were very good.  All in all, if you're hungry for breakfast, it's probably the best place to eat at the airport."}
{"text":"First of all the only reason this review is a 3 and not a 1 is the Bartender who worked on 12/1 nighttime. We sat at the bar and the GM was standing there changing the TV's. He did not say hey or greet us. His bartender was busy with tables and hurried to great us a few minutes later. He was super nice and apologized for the wait. He gave us great service to us and the whole restaurant as he helped great guests not in his section and great tables at the host stand. Where is the host at this place ? Like greeting is your most important job in a restaurant and you have no host. Dirty tables everywhere as managers just walk past them. The managers here are a joke. I am a manager at a restaurant and it was embarrassing for me to watch them do freaking nothing."}
{"text":"Food is OK-Place is OK!  I wouldnt say this is a place I frequent a lot, but its good for quick carryout. Food is OK. They have a 2 people for $20 menu, which is convenient. You get two entrees and an appetizer. I was tired and didnt want to cook last night and we decided to get Chilis carryout. I normally get the Chicken Salad, which is light and tastes pretty good, but last night I got the Chx Quesidillas as well as my husband, which was a big mistake. They were dry and the first half of the quesidilla was empty then the bottom half had cheese and a piece of chicken. This place has went down hill big time. Food seems bland and they just throw it together really quick.  I used to go to this location more with co-workers for lunch. I am staying away for while. Very disappointed. The chips and salsa were good (our app).   I would really rate it about 2.5 stars, but there isn't that option.  Reason a 2.5 (or 3 for Yelp) instead of 2 is, because the staff is always super friendly, they have good chips and salsa and its super quick to order. If you want to eat in, there is NEVER a line or wait, no matter the time or date!   If you check it out, don't get fancy and order something different. Stick to the easy stuff, soups and salads. They are pretty decent. Love the Broccoli Cheese."}
{"text":"Well, we went here in high hopes it would be like it use to be...when it was good.  My husband ordered original chicken tenders but got crispy chicken tendons.   They were disgusting.  I got baked potato soup, without a single potato and chewy, horrible bacon.  It was basically cheese soup.  Waiter disappeared and never wrote our order down so everything was screwed up.  We never saw him again and had to ask a hostess for a box.  Oh, and the bathrooms were run down and gross.  Never again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here about 3 to 5 times a month. We always sit at the bar and get really great service, the male bartenders know our names and what we like to drink. The food is always good, but the service is what keeps us coming back. My boyfriend always gets the crispy cheddar bites as a meal, they are delicious. I change it up all the time but often enjoy the boneless wings, steak fajitas, and always chips and  salsa. We suggest trying the presidente margarita!  We love to take advance of the \"ziosk\" they have to play games during our visit. we also joined the rewards program and log in when we are there to utilize points for free food."}
{"text":"Went to Chili's in Chandler, probably will not be back.  Waiting six minutes for a host to greet us.  The waitress kept disappearing.  The food as good but I don't like going anywhere I can't get decent service.  Our waitress kept leaning over me to place dishes on the table.  The biggest disappointment was the Garbage on the floor all over the restaurant.  Napkins, straw wrappers, food all over the floor.   The employees just walked past it all.  The restaurant was almost empty and several servers where sitting around doing nothing."}
{"text":"Ate here with my girlfriend. Typical chain restaurant. Wouldn't honor the happy hour beer prices at the table. Food came out cold as well as wrong. Would never go back to a Chili's ever again. Not surprising to see why Chili's are hurting for business. This place is the bottom of the barrel. Places like this have one goal in mind, serving poor quality food at high prices and getting as many people in and out as fast as possible. And it shows with their little computer at the table so you can pay as fast as possible and leave. Makes you feel like just another number in their corporate run fake Mexican chain."}
{"text":"I normally do the bar area and get great service.. The new sweet and smoky burger is very tasty great add to menu..."}
{"text":"After seating, waited for 15minutes without greeting or drink order.  I finally walked-out with my 6 yr old daughter as the help simply looked-on! 1 server working 12 tables by herself during prime lunchtime.  This has been a common occurrence at this location...horrible management.  If you are lucky enough to get service, it is extremely slow (especially for cocktails). We are finished spending money at this particular location. What a shame.  We have been customers of Chilis for many years."}
{"text":"Great fast friendly service,even on a friday at dinner time.  Cozy seating in the lounge smokehouse trio combo and chicken&steak fajitas....yummy yummy and so much food!  We rolled out of there stuffed! And paying right at the table and getting my plenti points and free chips&queso with my My Chili's rewards, totally awesome!  This is one of our favorite places and we will be back!   Oh btw Chili's you should bottle and sell your salsa and your spicy pickle slices! The pickles are utterly wonderful!"}
{"text":"This place just isn't for me. The menu stinks, the food is below par and its just so commercialized.   I really used to like Chilis, but they have lost their charm and they change their menu too much."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab a bit before a movie or get a beer and watch a game!! Food is always great, staff always friendly and prices very reasonable!! Joint there club and get deals every week!! :-) hungry just thinking about it!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Chili's in a while and the service was amazing (even though we had a large party) and the food was very good. The appetizers we ordered were all good, the chips and drinks were refilled quickly, and our main courses were very good, too! I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this Chili's since it's opened and have not been a fan of how much the menu has changed. But the worst part is the bar tender tonight mat. Whenever we come in here it could be 2 people or 20 and he never has good customer service. Rude. Have to ask for everything. No eye contact. We ask how he is and says good never asks back. Worst customer service ever!!!! Telly on the other hand is the best. Can we get a schedule of when he is here?"}
{"text":"Whether we sit at the bar and enjoy a game and a drink with our meal, or sit in the dining room with the kids, this is one of my favorite places to go.  The wait staff is always very pleasant, and generally very attentive.  The food is what you would expect from any Chili's, and any time it has not met my expectations (there have not been many of those times) the issue was rectified quickly.    A nice relaxing place to have a meal with the family, or just grab a drink to take a quick timeout on a busy weekend of running errands."}
{"text":"Always have great service here. Food was hot and delicious and our server, was amazing. I came here with my nephew and she offered to pay for the games so he would keep busy. The only downside was that I wasn't offered silverware or napkins."}
{"text":"Came to have dinner and they were pretty busy. We  took a high top table cause it was less of a wait. Ordered the bacon burger with NO ONIONS and guess what? It came with freaking onions! Ofcourse it never fails, waitress offered to make me another one but I didn't really feel like waiting 30 minutes for a burger so I took them off myself but the taste was still there . Be careful with those little iPads / game things they are not free! It will charge you $2 to play a game so don't do it accidentally! Waitress was very helpful."}
{"text":"Been her twice and the service sucks... the lady that serves me this last time had a disgusted face while asking what we wanted... I told her the table was sticky and she had someone come clean it witch still felt nasty!!! I ordered the the pick two rib and sausage meal and when it arrived it was cold the corn was so gross and so cold .... I'm so over this experience I won't be returning here"}
{"text":"This is an amazing little know diner right off the Vegas Strip.  I'm amazed by the vast selection of foods here.  Literally anything you could want.  It feels like a neighborhood store."}
{"text":"Chili's is awesome and always has been I've been going there for years I get the old-timer plane got to have my french fries well done no salt they did an excellent job very courteous great service thank you very much five stars"}
{"text":"I read through all of the reviews and had to disclaim many because of situational topics. I do not like chain restaurants...however we pulled the trigger because nothing in the area fit. Our experience was on par with our expectations of chain Restaurants. The food was good we split a slider meal and had a beer.  It is a moos and brews?  No but fitting under the circumstances."}
{"text":"For a franchise/chain - I have expectations. Some higher than others. Thus, after an evening of checking out various Las Vegas venues, I realized I was hungry and just needed some casual grub.   To me, I rate restaurants of this type in the following order: Applebee's, Chili's followed by TGI Friday's.   This review is for this location only! I've eaten at many better Chili's locations. Ordered the Ribeye with steamed broccoli and a side salad. All of it was served at once. Also had a Long Island Iced Tea.   1st, the long Island was yellow! Way too much sour. Tasted like a Walmart mix! For $9, it should have made me want a 2nd one.   The salad was bland and right out of a bad. Creamy blue cheese - tasted like Ranch and was maybe enough dressing for half the salad.   The steamed broccoli was steamed to perfection, but was totally flavorless!   Now the protein. Holy cow patties! Ordered Medium Well, because the last few steaks I've had were way under-cooked. This one did not qualify as a steak. More qualified as Dog Food! Over 35% fat and gristle. One half of the steak was Rare-Medium rare, the other half was Medium rare. Find a new meat supplier - you all charged $18 for this specimen, I expected much more.   Now my mindset.... I'd lost over $350 in the casino, just wanted a simple dinner. I seldom complain to management, because in this type of cookie cutter restaurant, more than one person failed to follow Chili's restaurant guide. The basics.   Maybe I was reeling from sucking so bad at table games, but honestly - when even the drink tasted bad (by Vegas standards) - something is wrong. Kind of like the goofus server that kept sweeping with her little broom and flipping scooper-upper, right next to my feet, twice during the meal.   I've said enough. A McDonald's experience would honestly have been better. Sometimes I'm a magnet for dung.  Ugh! Keep driving Yelpers.... This location sucked!"}
{"text":"The last 2 visits have been Wonderful.  This location has really stepped up their game!   My new favorite - mango chili chicken with broccoli and rice 510 cal.  Perfect!   The 2 for 22 comes with 2 side salads as an appetizer choice - winner! Chicken fajitas now come with beans and rice.   And the chicken crispers have 2 more pieces than before. Danielle was delightful and got all 6 orders perfect even with our idiosyncrasies.    No drama, timely service in a fun atmisphere."}
{"text":"Chili's is always good and the prices are all reasonable. I don't frequent chain restaurants very often but when I do find myself here, I always get great food and great service. I can't remember a time when that wasn't the case.  I was just there recently after a long day at work for HH.  Since the last time I was there, it looks like they offered a few new drinks and apps unless I just never noticed them before. I had the mango margarita for the first time and that was so good. It was one of the most perfect margaritas I've ever had! Perfect blend of tequila/sweet/tart ratio. It comes out in a frosty beer mug so I thought that was cool and different. Half of one gave me a good buzz and it was only $5!  The appetizers are always great, you can't go wrong with any of them. The prices ranged from $3-$5. Their nachos aren't your traditional piled on ingredients on a plate, they are individual chips topped with everything you should have with every bite of nacho. I thought this was genius, all the work is already done for you!"}
{"text":"Took my wife and 2 daughters (5 and 3) for lunch and had a great experience. The food was good but the service was better. Our server (whose name has slipped my mind) greeted us with a smile and was patient with my messy kids throughout lunch. He checked to see how we were doing multiple times, and we could just feel his positive energy. We also met the manager Vic who was also amazing.  He said hello and took the time to tell us how grateful he was that we were happy. He conversated about how he tries to instill great customer service with his employees and how proud he was to see the results. As an owner of a business I really appreciated the extra effort that's Vic and his staff put forward to make our experience as positive and fun as possible."}
{"text":"alright. my food was not bad... this LAST time... okay someone needs to start reading the orders sheets, when me and 2 others have soemthing wrong... but the waitress shows us she wrote it... something in the back is not working out right!  menu is dumb, i cant find what i want and its changed so much, its sad to say im done with my favorite restaurant.  last but not least of my complaints.... $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ what happend to amazing deals! i can buy and cook me and my family ribs for less then if we ate here! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ toooooooo high! if i wanted to pay the prices here id go to outback or some where nicer! this used to be a fun family cheap and amazing place, yet now i just want to never go again!"}
{"text":"They've changed the menu, and removed most of the dishes my family liked. No more carnitas fajitas, and the margarita chicken is now with Mexican rice.  Huge problem with the attitude we received when we asked about these changes. A lecture from a condescending manager about how we should appreciate the changes, which cost MILLIONS of dollars.  The service is still good here, but the menu is headed down hill, and the manager is a jerk."}
{"text":"Sat down at the bar and our server was friendly and quick. Ordered an appetizer (type of eggroll)  and it came out extremely quick and was very delicious. I ordered a 6 oz steak as my main dish and received broccoli and potatoes as my side. Everything was delicious but my steak was a little small. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I would say a 5, but they changed my favorite menu item:( However the staff, especially Crystal, is AMAZING! I'm thinking of stopping by today!"}
{"text":"My family an I haven't been here in years, and now we see why. First, the seating took extra long although there were seats available. We ordered an apple martini which turned out horrible. The drink was taken back, but took way too long to be remade. When we asked about it, our server said it was because the bartender was busy...she wasn't. The queso sauce was nasty. It tasted burned and a bit bitter. Our food finally came and it was lackluster. It all looked so much better on the menu. We didn't finish the food. The martini finally came towards the end. The saving grace was our server. She was very helpful. I don't think we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Why on earth did they change their fajita recipe?  Do they even use a marinade these days?  It was terrible.  Their chicken and steak fajitas used to ROCK!  Chips and salsa and margaritas good as ever but won't be going back just for that."}
{"text":"Service was horrible, food was cold, top shelf Tequila was Sauza... Servers or managers never checked to see how our meal was or if we needed anything throughout the course of our visit. Bartender was busy telling other patrons about how she gets drunk on her days off at her place of employment. Will never return and hope that this branch is closed soon. skip this crappy joint with the lazy staff. Ramen at home is better."}
{"text":"I cant believe this I literally just left this place came with my husband and two sons and I went without any acknowledgement from the staff for 15 to 20 minutes. No one came by not even for a drink order. We were seated pretty quickly so it's not like its busy. UNREAL. When we left the hostess with attitude told us to have a nice day. What the hell. Seriously time wasted. My husband is so mad , we will never be back to another chillies just based off this experience."}
{"text":"I always stick to the usual honey chipotle chicken crispers. The chips and salsa are pretty good too. Better than I expected. I tried their chicken and waffles the visit before this and they were ON POINT. Same honey chipotle dressing. Also their 2 for $22 is a great deal. 2 entree and an appetizer."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how the food was because after waiting 10 minutes (with no line) to get a table, placing our order, and 20 minutes later with no chips and salsa, we left. I should've known to leave when the person sitting beside of us complained that his food had taken so long.  Terrible!!!"}
{"text":"2 for 20 deal is great. The wife and I visited this locale last Friday evening and had a wonderful meal. If you sign up with chilli's email club you get an instant coupon for some free queso....chips and salsa....it is a really good deal. So naturally I signed up for the deal and then we were off to chilli's for some dinner. Along with the Queso...which my wife had...I ordered the fried cheese for our other appetizer. I had the Crispy honey chipotle Chicken Crispers with Fries and Corn on the Cob....while my wife had the Chicken Quesadillas with fresh tortillas. All this only cost 21.86...I mean that is a great deal for a nice dinner for 2 people....so get on over to chilli's and Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"How does a restaurant not have any low calorie or no fat salad dressing?  My friend got the chicken crispers,  which were inedible. A very unsatisfying lunch...."}
{"text":"We were there tonight on Cinco De Mayo. Busy night at dinner time.  Everything was very good. The service was fast and the food was very very good. Spot on! Good hard working bar keep and managers !"}
{"text":"this review is of the Chilis at 220 Upland Square  Stowe, Pa 19464  We went to enjoy a rare evening out on Valentines day.    Our Waitress came over to us a total of three times the entire meal we were offered no refills.    Our appetizer and main came out together after a 25-minute wait. once at the table, it was an additional 20 minutes to get my order corrected. (we had finished everything by then) this was done by the servers not the waitress the waitress did bring the final part of my order when it was done and was gone in a flash before i could say anything.   no one checks with us to see if our food was prepared correctly. Half my order was missing.  after an additional 20 minutes waiting for our check i had an adjacent waitress go and find our waitress who then handed us a check and then walked away to the back again   Furious i just paid the check and left.   I will be honest this was just about the worse service, I have ever experience. my wife refused to allow me to confront the staff at the time as i was just too darn mad to have anything constructive come of it.    I would be very hard pressed to every return to this location again which is a shame because we enjoy Chilis."}
{"text":"I've been to this Chili's many times before. I would say the food usually so so and nothing significantly great. The service at this particular Chili's is usually awesome! The servers are usually very attentive and try their best to ensure customers have a great experience.  The one thing food wise, that actually keeps me going back to Chili's is the Molten Lava Cake. It is a fresh warm cake with chocolate fudge, carmel on the inside, and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to give a touch of delicious, cold, and creamy goodness to the soft, rich, and warm cake.  Last time I was there, Chili's had a 3 items for $10 deal. It came with a drink, either chili, soup, or salad, and an entree listed under the deal. I ordered a strawberry Hi-C, loaded potato soup, and the Cajun Pasta without the chicken.   The food was as good as any other well known big chain restaurants. Chili's is usually a good place to go with friends when you and your friends are on a budget."}
{"text":"Great service and food at this place. Nice staff especially Shelby. Our drinks never went empty.  Our used dishes were taken away immediatly. Food was great. Steak cooked perfect. Cheers"}
{"text":"1/2 rack baby back ribs with smoked potatoes were good restrooms were clean. Service was OK but our waitress while pleasant was rarely seen. The new sour cream dip was to die for! Also tasted the Cajon grilled chicken pasta with extra toppings was also very tasty"}
{"text":"I normally stop here for breakfast when travelling through calgary international airport. It is one of the few restaurants available once you pass security. Fare is ok for a decent breakfast and good coffee.  15 dollars for breakfast"}
{"text":"Third time we've came here, and I've been disappointed. I always look forward to the frosted bar area that keeps our drinks cold, but it's still broken from over 2 months ago! What's going on? Why have something you're not offering that people enjoy? I know I'm not the only too because I heard a gentlemen next to me ask what's wrong with it as well... Is corporate being lazy? It sticks out like an eye sore. You would think they would fix something that draws so many people in."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend. We ordered steak meals. First they got her order wrong. We notified the waiter. He took it back. Instead of just fixing the order they brought out another steak. The steak was literally raw inside. Again they took it back. This time they didn't include the vegetable that it came with. She was waiting an extra 30 minutes for her food. We asked to see the manager. He basically acted as if he didn't much care and glossed it over. Unbelievable. The waiter said they were giving us a free desert. A free desert doesn't make up for that kind of poor service and apathetic attitude. We'll give a place a second chance for a mistake but this was just pathetic. If you're trying to lose customers you have succeeded. We won't be back."}
{"text":"It's Chili's.. Somewhat \"safe\" to go here, and only went more than once as the location to the hotel (walking distance). Food is so-so for Chili's. Service, only OK as well. Servers always seem to forget what you ask for, but they are very friendly."}
{"text":"While I usually go to non-chain restaurants,  I enjoy Chili's.  It started with a southwestern egg roll obsession in high school.   On this trip, the hostess was strange. We told her how many and that we wanted a booth. She said something about sitting us in the bar area because service would be faster or something. The booths there were small, so we asked for a different section which seemed to bother her. Eventually we were seated in a wide booth.  Our server was much better and friendlier than the hostess. We opted for the two for $35 deal which is pretty great: an app to share, two entrees, a dessert to share and two presidente  margaritas.    The food was good. It wasn't anything groundbreaking but we'll cooked comfort food. We had Texas cheese fries which were hot and loaded with cheese and bacon. I got the chicken fajitas. The chicken was juicy and came out sizzling with peppers and onions. I also appreciate that guacamole is one of the toppings you can use. I love the flavor of the black beans and mixing that with the rice. Dessert was a berry cobbler with ice cream. The cobbler was sweet and balanced with cinnamon.  All around a pleasing meal.   For a late meal, it was noisy. One table in particular was really noisy so the environment was not the best.  On our way out, the hostess was sitting down with her shoes off and looking at her phone. She didn't acknowledge us walking out. Not a \"bye\" or \"thank you\".   So overall a good meal at a decent price. Customer service could use a little work."}
{"text":"Our server was super friendly! We had a group of nine of us and when our food was on the way out two meals ended up dropping on the floor. The manager came and asked if we would each like sides to eat till the meals came out and even comped our two meals. Very impressed with the service we received! Also the honey chipotle chicken crispers are really good!"}
{"text":"I had one of the worst experience here. Not only did the food suck. But the customer service was awful as well. Slow. Very slow. Our server was very rude. I went to use a gift card and she told me the systems didn't take gift cards.  What do you mean? She didn't give me a response and just said the hostess up front should have told me that. Well, she didn't so now what? I ended up paying the bill with my own money when the gift card would have covered the bill. Definitely won't be eating at Chili's for a very long time. I see why you guys have a 2 and half star rating. Take your money somewhere else people!!"}
{"text":"We got there right when they opened. Everyone was nice and greeted up with a smile. Server was great, but the place was a little dirty. There was what looked like someone's hair stuck on the wall next to me. So I recommend looking around before you seat someone."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a few drinks last night, parking ourselves at the bar. The bartender was friendly, but was over extended. There weren't many at the bar itself (maybe 5 total, including us), but she had 3 high tops & 3 booths....all sat within 5 minutes. We (3 of us) had, between all of us, 4 bottles of beer, 3 shots, a rum & water and an appetizer.  The bill was over $60! 1 shot of fireball was $7....for 1oz shots! So over priced! I am not certain that we will be back, as we are very rarely on that side of town. I know I was shocked at the price of everything. I understand how corporate restaurants are, but I wasn't incredibly happy with our experience."}
{"text":"I have not eaten at a Chili's in roughly 10 years, so when we were out & about and saw one, I asked my husband if he would mind going there for dinner. He humored me and said OK. The greeter wasn't the friendliest young lady, but we were sat promptly. Our server was very sweet. She paid close attention to refilling our drinks and asking how we were doing, without being overbearing.   The food was pretty good. My stepson wasn't a fan of his pizza.....but to get him to eat his whole meal is a chore....my husband got the ribs and I got chicken enchiladas.  I loved my dish. My husband ate all of his ribs, stating they were good, but nothing special about them.  Three stars because it isn't particularly very clean....and I expected larger portions of food for the price. Server was great though! We may or may not be back, if we are ever over on this side of town!"}
{"text":"I agree on the bad service!!! the last 2 times have been BAD! I got up and left the last time. The problem I have is that I sent in to them recent a concern about this and the poor food and never got a reply from them We use to eat there 2 or more times a week"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason this place is getting three stars is because our server was awesome.  He paid attention, got us drinks quickly so we even had time for two each. He didn't interrupt when he could see there was serious conversation and we did not feel rushed, being your typical burn and turn type of restaurant.  Food was decent, but drinks and food was extremely overpriced for a place like this. $12 each for a house vodka and Red Bull??!!  The place was clean, but super, super ghetto.  People there scared me...  Not trying to be rude here, but would have sat at a table if there was one open instead of a booth because I had to sit on the edge of the booth to be able to reach the table."}
{"text":"Just waiting for my to go order but wanted to give a great BIG SHOUT OUT to Devin. He was very friendly and professional while helping me with my order. It's Valentine's Day and as you would imagine the restaurant is hopping and the back kitchen is a mosh pit of people and orders, but even under the chaos that a busy restaurant holds he is cool under pressure and makes you feel welcomed even just for picking up an order.  Thanks Devin! I hope the front of house has the pleasure of working with you too!"}
{"text":"Done with Chilli's.  The food here is subpar.  The fish tacos had a moldy taste. The triple berry desert was under cooked and cheap (the waitresses even commented it didn't look good but then did nothing).  The service was off several times on various requests.  They claimed to be out of house tequilla requiring a 3 dollar up charge on margaritas.  But even with all this it's Chilli's right?  Nope - get ready for the hard sell tactic of the waitresses standing at your table, ringing your bill on a tablet, her calculating a 20 percent tip and adding it to the bill, and then standing table side and asking if that's okay.  Really?  It's such a tacky move I will never again go to a Chilli's.  Now, the waitresses was average with a good attitude, but the food was horrible.  Do you really want me to explain why 15% would be generous?  Fine, pressure people to overpay you, but don't expect to see me again."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food at chili's, but service is usually slow. Anywho, my husband and I were hungry late one friday night, and it was 10:40 when I called to place a to go order (they close at 11) and they responded by saying \"uhh we close at 11\". I considered responding to that but then just said nope this isn't worth my time. This is their loss turning business away, as I decided to order from Cheesecake Factory instead (my employer)."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but waitress seemed annoyed from the start. After we ordered our girls got their food pretty quick which was great. Me and my wife's food took about 20 minutes to get to us and the girls were pretty much done with their dinner. We had pretty much lost our appetite by the time we got our dinner and took it home. Not even a thank you from the waitress. As we were walking out we didn't even get a thank you or good evening from the hostess either. Guess we're not comin back."}
{"text":"I came to this location for dinner  after being rudely told to go sit didnt even bother to walk me to the booth simply pointed to the booth from across the room. Then we sat there for aproxametly 20 min without anyone acknowledging , a server came and told us someone would  be with us shortly and 10 minutes passed by and we were finally helped by someone. As i looked around I couldn't help but notice that i hadnt been helped because the employees were to busy watching the game horible service if i could give it no stars i would!!"}
{"text":"Poor service, food is run of the mill. Best part is when they don't know who is supposed to be your server so you just sit there."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today with my wife and 3 kids. The hostes seated us and said the waiter would be with us shortly. We waited over 15 minutes without any waiter talking to us. I mean nothing. We got up, told the hostes that no one came to our table and we left. I refuse to give my hard earned money to a company that is this poorly managed. I don't come to Chilli's often. I will not be visiting another one."}
{"text":"It's not a place I would go to, but we were hungry and it was late.  It took about 20 minutes for us to be seated.  The place didn't seem to be so terribly crowded (in fact it was near closing).  The reason that it took so long was due to the fact that there were no clean tables available.  Rod B (03/06/2017) mentioned this in his survey.  My visit was just two days ago.  All of the tables around us had leftover food, soiled napkins and dirty glasses on them. Our orders were taken and when the food arrived, my friend had corn on the cob on his plate that he hadn't ordered (in addition to a portion of fries).  For the error, the waitress brought another order of fries. While the food was adequate, dining around tables that are filthy does not enhance the experience.  I might also add, that Las Vegas was experiencing record-breaking 117°F temperatures.  This can make a diner more sensitive to the surroundings.  That being said, there is still no excuse for a restaurant's failure to clean up after a meal if diners are being seated.  And given the fact that it's been more than three months' time since that complaint was noted, I think the restaurant proved that it FAILED it's customers again."}
{"text":"We caught them at a bad time. Most of the kitchen staff quit after new years eve. But we sat at the bar, watched TV and had a drink and an appetizer and a dessert it was a great time. The bartender was great worked hard to take care of us and was very friendly."}
{"text":"Fun place, good food, great staff.  Melissa is a great bartender, and I enjoy every visit. Recently had a friend visit from Denmark and Chili's is one of the places I took him to experience American dining.  I enjoy the atmosphere and consider the burgers on par with Red Robin."}
{"text":"Service was good- food was tasty. Unfortunately the place was pretty dirty. Two of the forks (out of three at the table) had food on them which is disgusting. The server got us new ones. I can understand overlooking one of the forks- but not two. Yuck..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple of cocktails and a bite to eat. Sat in the bar.  The bartender was really friendly and make me a couple awesome double vodka tonics also had some wings that were super good. Prices are really good as well. I will most definitely be putting this place on my favorite near by bars list."}
{"text":"I can see why this location has a steady three stars. The food is good. We've been here a few times and the food quality is consistent and pretty good. The service is always really good. In fact we've had excellent service on several occasions.  My reason for docking stars is because I feel like the company enforces the staff to care more about bottom line rather than customer satisfaction. For instance when ordering a side of avocado - you expect an actual side rather than two-three small slices. Or if you ask to substitute something especially if the substitution is cheaper why would I get charged extra for it. I felt like they were nickel and dime'ing me and that's not what I want from a restaurant. When I go out to eat I want to enjoy my experience and being able to customize my burger or etc. is part of that.   I do really enjoy the ziosk machine and because the food quality is usually on par with price I'm sure I'll return... But not as often."}
{"text":"Horrible. Service is slow and sucked. Lazy wait staff and the system was down for over a day. So cash only. Go to any other chilis except this one!"}
{"text":"This is the best local casual eatery in Henderson.   Catch their happy hour from 3pm to 7pm  and 9pm to close every week day.  Go see Jordan on Wednesday night at the bar.  She is awesome!"}
{"text":"Eh it's Chili's. Was Chili's really good 15 years ago or did I just not know any better then? Now days I don't ever choose to come here, but the boyfriend had a gift card and I thought I'd stick to chicken crispers. I remember them being some of the best tenders and they came with corn on the cobb that was always so good. They had a 2 drinks and dinner special for $35 and we did that. It came  with 2 presidente margaritas, an appetizer, two entrees (from a list) and a dessert. The margaritas came out in huge shakers and I filled my glass about 4 times and still didn't finish it. They were ok.  We got a half order of texas cheese fries for our shared app. They were really good. My chicken crispers and corn weren't terrible, but I ate very little and didn't even want to take the leftovers. He got ribs, they were ok. For dessert we shared a molten chocolate cake. The cake itself was eh but mixed with the molten center or sauce from the plate and ice cream it was quite good.   Service was lacking but not enough to make us mad."}
{"text":"I purchased the honey chipotle chicken and it was very good and well done. My dining experience was decent, the appetizer (chips and dip) took a while to be delivered, but everything else was just fine."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????4????? Poor service, an annoying Asian waiter. Poor service attitude. Tell me there's no location but let the four people in the back go in."}
{"text":"Just came back from eating at this location today 5/20/17 at 430 pm. We should have left when the hostess didnt smile and didnt greet us. We asked for a booth got told no no servers for that section, yet next people in were seated in the section we inquired about. Our server took what seemed like forever to take our order and did not want to explain something for me on the menu, she did but still was unclear. It took 20 minutes to get my chicken salad, husbands soup and salad came together. Wtf, a good server would not have served both at the same time. We had to ask for water, this after several servers passed our table without checking on us. I think the real disappointing shock was the server brought my plate with the people next to us. She then handed me my plate left to serve our neighbors and came back later with my husbands soup and salad. The chips were on the verge of being stale, and it was like someone spilt liquid on them as some were soggy. The salad lettuce for both of us as almost spoiled and wilted, no crunch at all. Either that or the plates were sitting in the window to long and the dressing soaked up the lettuce. The good by was a forced one. Usually the manager or hostess with open the door for people leaving and tonight it did not happen. We have been at this location in the past and have had great service and food, wonder if the snow birds birds going home has had a impact on service. Me thinks we wont be back here for quite a while if ever."}
{"text":"Mixed emotions. Server and food was awesome. But the bartender yelled at our server on the floor in front of guests. I'm so turned off about it. Haven't seen a manager the whole time to let them know how I feel. We had to chase them down. After we did our server apologized to the bartender  and the bartender was like it's okay. No, no it's not okay. It's disrespectful and unprofessional. Sad I wasted my date night with my husband here. Restaurant was really messy. Tons of chunks on the floor. So it makes me nervous what the kitchen looks like.  I've debated on if I should post this review. But from looking at other recent reviews things haven't gotten any better. Shame on upper management."}
{"text":"Chillis is one of my favorite chain restaurants. I work across the street and come here for dinner probably every other week. Lately things have gone down hill. I came for dinner (6:30pm) on 7/11. Our server was pleasant. However our guacamole (as you can see in my dessert photo) was not touched after the initial bite. It was so bad. I told her it tasted freezer burnt. She said they just took them out of the walk in and maybe they where too cold. But didn't offer us another option when we let her know our disappointment.  Dinner was actually good, but the plates where burning hot, which means it was under the Heater for to long. And considering we didn't eat the guac I'm not sure why the delay bringing our food out.   I was annoyed she didn't clear any plates when we pre bused for her. When it was time for us to pay she told us to use the ziosk. It had the wrong tables bill on it($20). When I told the girl it was wrong so she wouldn't get in trouble she was annoyed at us. She finally found the correct ziosk, and put it abruptly down, it knocked off the battery pack and had to be reset. She left us there for like 5 minutes when I finally flagged down the manager to take my payment so we could leave.   Restaurant was slow. There was a bad rain storm  and no reason for the issues."}
{"text":"I am not a snob when it comes to chain restaurants. I actually find it rather comforting that no matter which location, you pretty much know what to expect. I hadn't been to a Chili's in some time since the one near us closed and it's not the kind of place you go out of your way for. but still, I didn't expect this.   The one I remembered was fairly bright and cheerful; this was dingy and actually sort of scary looking. Big surprise on a more affluent side of town. Everything looked like it could use a good scrub down, and maybe change the light bulbs or something because there was a definite pall of depression hanging over it all.   We decided to start with a chili dip appetizer. This was marked on the menu as a best seller. I think that was a trick. We received a dish of what I imagine the Game of Thrones infamous \"bowl of brown\" would resemble. It was a glop of what I assume was canned chili in its former life, mixed with what I can only imagine was canned cheese sauce, and reheated until it WAY past time to toss it, then thrown on a plate with some greasy tortilla chips and served to us. Nice.  We hoped the entrees would be better, but for a place that advertises itself as a destination for ribs, my advice is to keep going. These were also overcooked to the point of chewiness, and I also suspect it was not their first day on the premises.  Perhaps the dreary lighting was an intentional ploy to discourage close inspection of the questionable food.  They deserve one star, but are getting kicked up one because the server was energetic and really trying hard.  He deserves better. So do you."}
{"text":"Took away all the good things on the menu including the onion strings. Now they have frozen onion rings like everyone else. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Didn't think this place could get any worse but alas it has. It is around 60 degrees out side and feels colder in the restaurant. Asked the bartender if they could turn the air up so it would not be a meat locker in here and was told oh it's just a little cold, it will warm up. No it won't but ok. No tip and won't be back ever again. My tip for whoever reads this- don't bother with this Chilis. We've been saying this for 2 years. They don't care. People around us are complaining. They don't care. Guy behind is wearing a zipped up ski jacket, they absolutely do not care. We will Never go to Chili's Again. You guys are horrible and could not give a rats $&@!!!"}
{"text":"Man. I hate leaving one star, but I can't find much to praise. I've been a loyal chilihead for years and it pains me to see the decline in the atmosphere and food quality but this is what it is now. I've been here about 3 times the last couple months and tonight will be my last. We sat at the bar without so much as even an acknowledgement for about 15 minutes. When we did it was an unfriendly greeting, like we were the burden. Despite attempts to be friendly it was unrequited. The food quality has greatly diminished. The chips were extremely oily, the lettuce on the salad was almost brown. The price just isn't worth the experience anymore. I hope corporate notices and changes are made but I won't be returning. Sorry"}
{"text":"I used to work in the restaurant industry. I'm more than nice when it comes to service and tipping. We sat at the bar. It took a bartender 5 to 7 minutes to greet us. We finally ordered our drinks, they were served right away (luckily!) . Then we ordered 2 appetizers- egg rolls and nachos. When we almost finished our drinks, appetizers still were not there. There is a reason why I don't go to places like that . You ruin people's experience. 2 APPETIZERS CANT TAKE THAT LONG!!!!!!!!!! If someone from Chili's corporate is reading this, you got to contact me personally... you don't even deserve one star. By the way, we are still hungry... it's really really sad... watch out if you go there! You might leave still hungry!!!!"}
{"text":"Well, it is what it is. Nothing spectacular, but The good thing is that the wait is never too long and that the prices don't seem terrible! It's really good when you do that sharing deal, then why not go, but just going to go, don't bother. Food just tastes like typical bar food, wouldn't want to come unless I was with someone doing the sharing deal. Just ehh in my opinion."}
{"text":"Awful Bad service  40 minute wait for terrible food Waiters blamed it on no shows for cooks"}
{"text":"Not sure why the horrible customer service reviews. We found the service to be good and quick. The servers have always been pleasant and hardworking. The issue we have is with the food. After all that is why one goes out to eat- well and also to get good service. But food and the ability to not have to cook it is the reason we like to eat out. We have typically gone here on a busy Friday night and have had no issues with the service.  I ordered the all you can eat soup and salad. The salad had a tiny bit of cheese which was pitiful. Nor even enough to say there was cheese on the salad. My husband ordered the 10 oz steak and it was not cooked to his liking or order. Great job on keeping the drinks refilled and timeliness of the order. We have just have never been impressed with the food. It's easier and cheaper to pop in a frozen dinner in to the microwave because that's how the food tastes. Unfortunately we keep giving them chances especially with the two for $22 but that was our last visit. Just never impressed."}
{"text":"I hate it when the server doesn't know the menu.  Even worse when the appetizer and the main course arrive at the same time.  Add to only receiving our bar drinks five minutes earlier made for a very rushed meal. The manager was kind enough to comp our aps, but she could have done more.  The kitchen was supposedly backed up, so they held off seating people until the kitchen could catch up.  Now with at least six empty tables, why couldn't they seat us and provide us with drinks, space out the aps and main course, and everyone would have been happy.  I think the blame falls on the management on this one.  The food however was good, not exceptional, but chain restaurant, you really can't expect superior food, but its fine for after a movie.  A nice change from the local pizza joints."}
{"text":"I know, I know....  it's a chain restaurant and their are soooo many Chili's around the Phoenix metro, why would I write a review on this one?    Because it's the closest one to Anthem and I am hoping the Yelp \"fairies and gods\" will listen to my review and influence the mgmnt team!!  This place has all of the ingredients in becoming THE CHILI'S of all Chili's.   Great location, customers and little to no competition!!   So what's the problem?  The consistency of their service and food are deplorable.  Some visits they are well staffed with friendly and attentive servers and on other visits they little to no staff and they seem disgruntled and cantankerous.   The grub~ We always have to send something back or they will forget something.  It's gotten so bad we have resorted to ordering just soup and salad at this location and they seem to find a way to mess that up too.  The soup is either over seasoned or under seasoned, and they don't look at their salads close enough when hey make them.  We found lettuce cores in both salads on our last visit...  I'm pleading to the Yelp gods to influence the mgmnt in this restaurant.  I've tried to listen to their excuses and apologies, give them advise, and even coaching but they keep making the same mistakes...     At least the beer is cold, but you might have to wait to get it even if your the only person there."}
{"text":"Here's my letter to Chili's via their website:  I stopped by Chili's tonight for a dinner with my friends. We were taken care of by Thomas H. (I believe the first name was Thomas). This has been my best Chili's experience far and away. His brother taught me high school math, so I knew who he was. He noticed my MSU Spartans shirt, and we chatted about Michigan and his brother. After placing our order, he brought us chips \"just because\". It's small things like that that make me want to come back to restaurants. The food was pretty good, but the check really surprised me. He made my friend's salad a side salad on my course and even took off our drinks. He also made sure to stop by several times and refill drinks and ask how our food was. Wow, what an awesome guy. Needless to say, he got a pretty big tip from me.  This experience alone has made me want to frequent Chili's. It's people like Thomas that help a business thrive. Far and away the best service I've ever had.  ____________________________________________  Totally above and beyond. 5 stars from me.  Update: After writing to Chili's, they sent a letter in the mail along with $10 in free food. Class act.  Update: Food and service have taken a dive. -2 stars."}
{"text":"They have good food and drinks for a fair price. The service is good over all but everyone is going to have a bad day now and then. I used to go a lot more often than I do now, but I'll be going back again at some point, I'm sure. There's nothing really outstanding about this place, good or bad. It's a Chilis, just like the rest of them."}
{"text":"Of all the similar chain restaurants (TGI Fridays, Applebees, Ruby Tuesday, etc), Chili's is definitely my favorite. My addition to mashed potatoes dictates many of my menu choices, so I often get the Monterey chicken with mashed potatoes.   Unfortunately, I've had some painfully slow experiences at this Chili's. Sometimes it takes forever to get seated. Then it also takes a ridiculous amount of time for your food to come out. The staff is usually pretty apologetic. One time the manager brought my friend and I a free cake dessert (um, to share) to make up for the long wait. It was a nice gesture, but we would have preferred a discount since we had already taken way too long of a lunch break."}
{"text":"Love this place its the best if u want a mix if all kinds of different foods and drinks love the new look of the place"}
{"text":"Recently made a visit to this particular Chili's to take advantage of the $20 meal for 2 deal. Even though you getting a good deal on the food the restaurant raises prices on other items in order to break even. For example a small drink in the bar was $8!!   The food items on the $20 meal deal are sub standard at best. I had the baby back ribs (totally dried out) and the wife had chicken crispers (very greasy and no taste at all). The corn on the cob with the chicken dinner was ICE COLD and had to have it sent back to the kitchen to be replaced.   One more side note, on the way to the restroom, walked past the kitchen, and the kitchen looked like a someone lost in a food fight as there were food scraps littered on the floor throughout the kitchen area.   I always had good experiences at Chili's over the past 20 years. The experience I had with the most recent visit it will be a very long time before I step foot into another Chili's establishment."}
{"text":"I went to two weeks ago after graduation since there was literally no other place open at 10pm. My boyfriend got there first and requested a table for 10. The rest of us get there and wait patiently for someone to come and take our drink order. We wait at least 15 minutes before a friend of mine gets up and starts asking random servers to send OUR SERVER to our table. Dude finally comes and takes our drink order.  We were so upset we made him go ahead and take our food order. It takes another 15 MINUTES for us to get our beverages!!! The service was just UNACCEPTABLE. We kept complaining and the manager came and personally apologized to us. He gave us a free cheese dip to try and calm the waters. Our food still took another 30 minutes to get to the table. I ordered the classic sirloin and requested it be cooked medium. When I got the sirloin it was WELL WELL DONE. Needless to say I was very upset. I took one bite and sent it back. The manager apologized and did not charge us for the plate. Not sure what was going on this night but the service was absolutely horrible. I have eaten here before but never experience such unpleasant service."}
{"text":"I and nine other coworkers decided to dine at Chili's last night (September 16th). Chili's was chosen because we were celebrating a coworker pursuing a different career. We had a reservation for 6:15pm. Our waiter, TJ, advised us that due to the size of our party, he would have someone helping him. Here is where the dining experience and customer service level quickly diminished. There was a long wait to receive our drinks. I understand the bar has to make the mixed drinks; however, waiting for at least 20 minutes is unacceptable. My coworker whom we were celebrating ordered a frozen Margarita. When the waiter returned, he advised her the machine was broken. She attempted to make light of the situation with a joke; however, the waiter was clearly not amused. Her next choice was a regular Strawberry Margarita, and there was still a long wait time to receive that. Her first sip of the drink confirmed it was not a Strawberry Margarita and the color was extremely pale. When she advised the waiter this drink was not what she had ordered, the waiter appeared uninterested in correcting the issue. My coworker had to take it upon herself to go directly to the bar and have another drink made. At this point in the evening, we asked our waiter what had happened with his help? His response: \"I wish I knew\".  We realized there was no salvaging this dining experience. We advised the waiter we would like to cancel our food orders and close out our tabs on the drinks and to please send the manager to the table. We advised the manager of our reason for dining at Chili's and that we were unhappy with the long wait and lack of help for the waiter. The manager was clearly disinterested with our complaints and offered no reason as to why the waiter had no help. She offered no apology and was clearly unconcerned about the appalling service we had received . I remarked to the manager that a simple \"I'm sorry\" would have greatly alleviated our frustration. Her lack of concern confirmed that our dining experience was not a priority. A few minutes later, the manager returned to the table and advised that our food should be ready in 10 minutes. Clearly, she did not comprehend our basic request, nor was there any communication between her, the waiter or kitchen staff. What part of \"cancel the food order and close out the drink tabs\" is difficult to understand? During the duration of our visit, I noticed the restaurant was never very busy or full, and now I understand why. Chili's located at Whitehall Commons # 864, 8164 S Tryon Street, Charlotte NC has lost mine and my coworkers' business.  I was advised via email to include my phone number and a supervisor would contact me in 24-48hrs. I have not received a phone call in there stated time frame."}
{"text":"Be careful.  My wife ordered the chicken tacos and there was no more than 1 ounce of chicken in the taco.  When I asked the waitress she agreed and was actually embarrassed.    The fajitas were great.  They have a new prime rib fajita and it is awesome.  A good size portion and cooked perfectly.  The chips and salsa are as good as always.  Try the guacamole.  It is very good."}
{"text":"Standard chili's fare.  Got a buffalo chicken sandwich which tastes the same as any other location.  My fries tasted a little off.  Not sure if they were cooked In old oil or something else but they had a bitter aftertaste.  Had to ask for a refill on my drink.  Prices are reasonable for an airport."}
{"text":"The service was amazing. Our server was very attentive and warm. When our food was taking a little longer the manager came out and apologized without my party complaining. Blueberry pineapple margarita is delicioussssss."}
{"text":"Ended up going because we couldn't get into Sly Fox, and the youngest wanted to check it out.  Honestly, I hadn't been to a Chili's in about 15 years.  Menu has been totally overhauled from what I remember.  Draft selections were blah.  Got the Yuengling IPL, which was not good but I had never had it before, so I didn't know if I like it, or not.  Waitress said she was still training, and this was like her second night...she did fine.  Kids got the sliders, and a corn dog which they enjoyed until the corn dog broke off the flimsy stick after one bite and ended up on the floor.  Guacamole was actually decent.  The Chili Trip Burger that was on special was awful.  First, it was a burger, and fries that could've just been placed on a standard plate.  It came out on this long, silver tray thing with the burger smashed in the corner and all this chili, and cheese sauce oozing out through the sides of the tray.  I get over that part that I am scratching my head at, and eye up this unappetizing looking mess, and take a bite.  Not good.  Tastes like they were shaking salt on there, and the lid came off.  Two bites and done.  Fries were soggy, and not good either.  I already felt bad about the gal scratching the beer from the bill because she knew I wasn't digging it.  I didn't mention how bad the burger was after they cleaned off the table.  I passed on dessert.  Kids got Ice cream, which you can't mess up.  With tip, the damage was around $75.  I suppose I'm not sure how to feel about that.  Not exactly in a rush to get back."}
{"text":"About what you'd expect from a Chili's--no complaints, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"not really impressed.  We waited so long for our food.  I wish we went to Mimi's cafe located super close.  waste of time."}
{"text":"Love this location. Perfect for the football watcher and the 3.95 margs don't hurt either!  Try the white chocolate molten lava cake. So freakin' good!!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at a few different Chilis recently and the experience has been the same across the board.  I used to love Chilis, and now I think it's AWFUL!  They have definitely sacraficed quality and service.  Their menu is poor compared to what it used to be, and their fajitas are now terrible. The marinade on the meat is inappropriate and doesn't taste good.  The quality is poor.  Everything is an extra charge - beans and rice, chips and salsa. Beware. If it's not specifically listed on the menu with your dish and they ask you if you want it, it's an extra charge. The margaritas still have a good flavor but they are no longer served in margarita glasses as they used to be. Now they come in a beer mug. Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I like my margaritas done right.  All things considered, I don't think this place is worth going to anymore, and there are definitely places with much better food for the price.  I am no longer a Chilis fan."}
{"text":". Good place to \"Chil\" while waiting for my flight back down to the States. I'm used to having Margarita in a Chili's down in California, watching a ball game, talking Spanish to Spanish speakers, but this has got to be the first Margarita with Canadian Curling on the screen. Can you cross-check  with these brooms? I wonder.  The restaurant menu is fairly straight forward bar food, but good. Narrow aisle, just like aircrafts, so you will feel right at home. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Met up with Rand H for lunch today, only because I had a coupon for one of their new flatbreads.  Like Rand, I ordered the bottomless express lunch with soup and salad.  I had the caesar  salad and it was just okay; it comes already mixed with the dressing and was a little too much for my taste.  I'd have preferred the dressing on the side like the regular salad.  I also had a small bowl of their loaded baked potato soup and that was pretty good.  Not too thick or thin and had chunks of potatoes plus the toppings.  Added a little black pepper and it was probably the best part of my lunch.  They gave us a huge platter of tasty chips and salsa, but I thought the salsa was a little too tomato saucy for my taste.  I like salsa with some heat and this was really mild and bland.  I ordered the chipotle chicken flatbread and it was served on a huge long platter and looked really good.  The flatbread had good flavor, although a bit salty, but with chipotle in the name I was hoping for a little more spice.  Service was good, drinks refilled, plates cleared in a timely manner.    It was everything I expect from a Chili's and I'm sure I'll be back again at some point."}
{"text":"FAIL! Made a reservation for 6:30 well in advance, arrived at 6:30 and was told it would be a 40 min wait! Apparently they don't know what a reservation is! Oh well, DIRTY anyway!"}
{"text":"I am used to Chilli's in Lebanon, where it is fresh generous and delicious. So when I tried it in Las Vegas I was shocked!   We started the meal with some fresh guacamole and chips, which were good. No debate the guac was fresh but it was kinda flat tasting.   Then my husband and I shared some texas fries and one pork & steak fajitas. The fries were horrible! The looked and tasted stale like they were from yesterday's batch! Unacceptable! As for the fajita, well first of all the portion was way too small. Barely any meat on the plate but lots and lots of onions. Well Jeez thanks! And it tasted ok at the best...."}
{"text":"I went to eat dinner recently here with a friend of mine. I must mention I had eaten here the previous week at lunch time and Clay was amazing as was the food. Unfortunately, apparently when you come at dinner time that's not the case. Our waitress was busy and seemed put off when we needed help. I am on a somewhat keto plan and so I literally only eat the meat and cheese of a burger. I was first brought out a patty that the entire bottom was burnt to a crisp. I asked them if they could bring me a new one since it was over done and this is what they brought me. Absolutely ridiculous as you can see it's way over done and a horrible excuse for a burger. Nonetheless, they \"graciously\"  took it off the check for me and really didn't do much else. Thankfully my friends grilled chicken sandwich was good and she couldn't finish it or I would've left hungry. Not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"Loved this place months ago.  Don't know what happened but food has nose dived especially Fajitas and quesadillas.  The onion to vegetable ratio is now 4:1.  Everything undercooked.  WHAT IS UP WITH ALL THE ONIONS?   They use it as a filler but it now takes over entire flavor of dish.  \"Hey want some chicken on side with your onion quesadillas? \"  Hot Carl OF"}
{"text":"The food was good, the servers were really nice. But the service was super slow. Took about 20 minutes just to get my water from them. We also had to ask them after 30 minutes waiting for our food where it was. Then the waitress came back with it and said it was ready. It was sad cuz there were a lot of people waiting outside in the rain to get in and we couldn't go any faster then what they were going. When we got there, it wasn't too busy for them to be that slow."}
{"text":"We always have a great experience here. Food is always hot, fresh and delicious. Wait staff is friendly and efficient. Managers are always out in the dining rooms looking and checking on guest. We will love it here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here multiple times since we live around the area and it has just been going downhill. This last visit was our worst yet. Once we were seated we were ignored and only finally helped 20 minutes later, and it wasn't even a busy night. We were about about to get up and leave when our server finally realized we haven't been helped. The chips were stale and unsalted, and the food was just bleh. It really seemed liked nobody working there really wanted to be there. Our overall experience was just bleh. I don't think we will be going there again any time soon."}
{"text":"i went with my family on valentine evening ,they were busy , one of my kids got the food not cooked all the way ,, the manager was great man ,he brought a fresh breast grilled chicken and he took care of us very well, such a great service it mean a lot,,,"}
{"text":"Well that was one of the worst meals I've had in a long time. We asked to have our son's food first so we could feed our 1 yr old and everything came out at once in under 5 minutes. The food was sub par at best, the \"crispy chicken\" was more soggy then my pasta and half of her dish was ice cold and the corn on the cob was raw.  And my dish was better served out of a buffet. It might not have been so dry and tasteless if the food was not cooked this morning . My wife's drink originally came with something floating in it. Even though it was a Saturday evening it was still early, we saw the bus boy at our table more often than our waiter. It has been some time since our last visit to a Chili's and the only reason we went there tonight was because we had a gift card. I think it will be some time before we'll feel brave enough to try them again."}
{"text":"It's all about taco Tuesday.  I love the taco and marg specials they run!  Well worth a trip to have some drinks and Mexican after work one Tuesday :)"}
{"text":"This location is not worth patronizing. We used to eat at this location 4-6 times a month. The last three times have been ridiculous!! Stopped in after the rush on a Friday night and half the tables were empty. Hostess told us it would be 45 minutes to get a table. We left!! Next visit was at lunch and the server made multiple errors and food took forever. Last night we stopped by and strike three, we're done. Empty restaurant, 30-45 minute wait. Not sure what has happened at this location, but I will not waste my time again. Went to Afton Tavern after we left, very busy and we still got seated right away. Good service and good food!!"}
{"text":"Hey nice place to eat  slow seating host and slow server also must be short emp., today I guess? Clean and food is fresh at least just have to wait a lot and there slow but guess an off day....;)"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere- looks like they are planning on updating soon.  Great staff: Adam has been there for years and goes above and beyond.  Good food: lots of options, for all tastes."}
{"text":"Brandon was ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS AND PHENOMENAL!!!! He made sure our food came out on time and as quickly as possible, as well as keeping our drinks full at all times. Chili's has been one of my favorite restaurants as a kid, and I am definitely a lifetime customer. If Brandon hasn't gotten a raise yet, HE NEEDS ONE!"}
{"text":"Not the best place to spend your money we should have waited the 30 minutes at red Robin. Sloppy styled burgeres that fall apart while you eat them. Don't like that they have pitchers of water just sitting out everywhere who knows if anything was put into them while left unattended. I would recommend going somewhere else. Unless like we were left eighther waiting at a good restaurant or going to the one with no business for obvious reasons. Servers need to be more attentive should always need to track them down or ask for refills when empty."}
{"text":"This Chili's has one of the friendliest staffs I've ever experienced.  Our waiter was very nice and was helpful in making adjustments to my order for my diet.  Not only did he expedite our order so we could make our movie on time, he even brought over the check and to-go boxes within 60 seconds of asking for them  I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We left macayos after waiting for 40 minutes to get a server at our table and came to Chilis. We showed up frustrated and hungry. We were immediately sat and doted on by two servers. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"I live next door and always come here. Always come hungry and leave happy. Good food. Great prices."}
{"text":"I have to admit, it is one of the nicest Chili's I have been to in quite some time. Albeit it was a Sunday afternoon so it was a smidge slower than say a Friday night, it was still a nice. The chips we had for the chips and salsa were warm and delicious and the lighter fare chicken salad was excellent. One of the waitresses however seem to be having a bad day as it appeared she was in some type of disagreement with one of her tables. I actually felt bad for her because like everyone else, I couldn't help but stop and stare like everyone else. All in all, we will be back again soon."}
{"text":"We have always had great service and the food is always the best.  We even were having a birthday here once and it got late we said we would leave and they happily said hang out we are still cleaning up.  Love this place and their staff."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this chili's, but i think i give up here.  Even though their menu seems fairly large, everything seems to be the same. I can never decide what i want & nothing hardly ever sticks out to me.  Also, service is hit or miss. I've had okay service one time but another time was no so good. We had a new server who probably wasn't ready to be out on his own to make a good impression for their restaurant. (I'm only saying this because I've been a server for a few places.. a few more days of following someone, he would've been ready).   On our last visit, we sat around for a good 8-10 minutes before our server came over for the 1st time. It might not seem long but the restaurant wasnt busy (our half of the restaurant had a total of 2 other tables) & we didnt even get a quick \"be with you in one moment\" or anything.   Finally, i'm no fan of waiting long for my food, but i should atleast wait long enough to know that it was fresh. We ordered our food, had a quick 2 minute convo, then i used the restroom to washed my hands. On my way out, our food was being brought to our table.  hmmmm... i waited longer to be greeted than for my food to come out? Something doesnt seem right. It was hot but i'm a little worried how long it had been sitting under heating lamps :\  I'll take my $35+ elsewhere for a decent dinner."}
{"text":"The only chili's that I had dined at in the past, was The Waterworks. After a few bad meals there, we gave up. After shopping at Burlington we decided to come here.   When entering, the host mentioned no tables were available and asked us if we wanted to sit in the 'lounge'. Lol its just a bar area. I was upset because there were at least 5 tables around that were cleared, they just needed wiped. The host was too lazy to do it. Very rude. We settled for the bar area. Thankfully there were booths (small booths.. One person per side) however, the tables were so tiny. Anyways let me get over that lol.  For appetizer we went with the trio where you can pick 3. We went with southwestern eggrolls, sliders and fried cheese balls. The southwestern egg rolls were amazing. The other 2 apps were also good.  My boyfriend went with a full rack and I chose the prime rib mex bowl. Both of our meals were good. Actually my boyfriend couldn't stop talking about how great his was.  The only reason stopping 4 stars was service. The host obviously was awkward and then sitting in the bar srea, the bartender was our server. I just wish we could've been seated at a table. Whatever"}
{"text":"They have great food at this location always well cooked and always comes out hot but I'm giving this location 2 stars which I rather give them 1 star because management is awful and I'm saying that nicely the first bad experience I had was on my birthday and the second bad experience with management was last night . Let's just say this will be my LAST time ever eating at this location and for all my friends and family as well . The manager is RUDE DISRESPECTFUL and UNPROFESSIONAL. She is not a friendly person she honestly looks like she hates her job. I will be calling to get a hold of the district manager and will call cooperate to explain to them my horrible  experience. I don't want anything for free for the inconvenience it's nothing like that I just really hope they reconsider who they have as their manager here. This is not someone I would want managing my company.  I will not get into detail on here but I'm warning anyone who eats here stay away from the manager . If you look at any of my other reviews I am not one to write bad reviews I'm a very humble and easy going person ."}
{"text":"My wife and I dropped in to get something to go a week or two ago.  It was a Tuesday night, practically empty.  We ordered a sirloin and the crispy chicken tacos.  I'm not sure what the problem was, but it took 30 full minutes to get our meal.  While my tacos were good, the steak was very cold (I live within walking distance of this location, it wasn't the drive home).  All around a disappointing visit."}
{"text":"This was the first place I ate at when I arrived in Phoenix. The waiter was very friendly and the food was great. The other reviews you see here are stupid if you ask me. People expect soo much and shouldn't be so picky. I ordered the Cascadilla and it was delicious!   Being from Canada, we don't have chili restaurants but I had always heard about it. Glad I finally got to try it.  My server played hockey and knew all about Canada which was a major pro for me and made talking with him easier as we had something in common.   Will be going back later this week!   Oh oh oh and one more thing, I had to come back and edit my review after reading other people's reviews. People are complaining about the portion sizes. The portion sizes are normal, maybe all of you should eat less and quit being pigs."}
{"text":"Chilies used to be a family store for us. We had just begun coming back over the past few months. However I do not know if it is this particular restaurant or if it is a corporate issue, but I could have gone to McDonald's or Burger King and gotten a better salad then what I got tonight. I did not even know any place still made salads that were all iceberg lettuce. To their defense the four pieces of spinach that they placed in the salad I guess should've been enough to classify it as mixed greens.  My husband got the cheese enchiladas which the sauce was horrible it was way over  seasoned with chili powder and probably cumin, almost a dark black color. We live in the state of Arizona we do know what enchilada sauce, red sauce is supposed to look like and this was not it.   We did not complain to the manager because it probably would've been no good. Our server was OK not very attentive as he would had been on shift since 9 AM this morning and admitted that he was fried  Needless to say next time I feel like having a chicken salad I will go to McDonald's or Burger King and actually get one that is decent and served with actual mixed greens"}
{"text":"The whole experience was disappointing. Went out to eat with my husband- was greeted by a friendly hostess and seated almost right away. ( No wait on a Friday night should have been a red flag )  For some reason we had two servers?? -overlapping sections maybe? Who knows- either way it was confusing and made no sense why neither of them were actually waiting on us- we waited a while just to be greeted (enough time that we knew what we were ordering) Our food took about 25 minutes to come out, and when it did it was incomplete and my entree was completely cold, and the plate was scorching hot. Meaning it sat in the window for way too long. We waited and waited for one of our servers to come check on us just so we could send the cold food back! They never apologized and looked unsurprised to see that my husband had basically already finished his meal by the time my hot entree was re-served. Overall food was unimpressive and definitely not worth the price or the wait. Manager came by asking how our dinner was and seemed desperate- she kept saying things like \"promise you'll come in again?\" But didn't comp any part of our meal. Overall very disappointing. But looks like we weren't the only people who wrote a bad review and despite the manager's plea- won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Our waiter was very friendly, he had a southern accent. I could not tell if he was a high school kid or college kid but he was very friendly and provided great service.  I had the lunch special - half soup and half salad. For soup I had the chili- it was way too soupy. Come on, pack the protein, more beans and more meat please! The cobb salad was not bad. The avocado dressing that came with it was delicious. And $7 for that? Oh yeah."}
{"text":"Great options! Great food! Good drink options. Always a good option for appetizers, a burger or ribs. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Next time you don't know what's for dinner just head on over to chili's."}
{"text":"This restaurant was completely dead when we walked in maybe 4 people in the bar and the restaurant part maybe two tables at the most which is what you would expect for a Monday evening.  We ordered the ribeye steak and a cheeseburger.  On top of the food taking forever, the waitress was nowhere around to even ask what was going on.  She finally comes out, drops off the food and leaves. The steak was overcooked the potatoes were cold and we waited and waited for her to come back to check on us.  Well that never happened.  Keep in mind the restaurant was dead.  I finally ended up looking up a number on Google calling the restaurant and the manager actually answer the phone and I asked him if he can send the waitress over to our table to send back our steak.    Mr manager pops over apologizes for the inconvenience ask me what I wanted to order.    I got a cheeseburger he leaves and we wait again.  While we're waiting we obviously completely pissed off the waitress because she dropped off drinks at our table and didn't even look at us.    Mr manager brings the cheeseburger out and then he disappears too.  For whatever reason the cheeseburger had no mayonaise on it and was completely dry.  At this point you'd think the manager would circle back or maybe the waitress just to make sure things are okay. Well that didn't happen.  So I ate my dry cheeseburger paid the bill which nothing was discounted and left.    I didn't even get a sorry your experience wasn't pleasant or have a nice night nothing its like I wasn't even there."}
{"text":"Just went to Chili's last night for dinner.  My biggest complaint about this place is the service.  I know we had been seated in the restaurant for about 50 minutes before we got our food.  My glass of water was empty for the majority of the time (had to wait for the ice to melt to get any water).  Our waiter also kept changing.  Now to the food... The chips were not the warm oily chips that you expect from Chili's.  The chips were just typical and kind of dry.  The salsa was ice cold.    On the plus side the food was good.  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and the chicken was excellent.  Everyone else at the table liked their food too.  I just wish the food had came out a bit sooner.    Also, I thought the hostess had good customer service skills.    I personally prefer the Chili's in Gastonia over this one that is near Northlake mall."}
{"text":"This chilis is okay the food is what you would expect. My issue is the bar it just smells dirty like they spill cocktails all over the floor and do not clean up daily. Not bad for takeout but you still have to smell the bar when you go to pickup"}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant when don't have a comp'd meal at our casino/hotel we are visiting.  The service has always been prompt, the servers great, and the food always consistently great.  You just can't beat the 2 for $20 chicken fajitas for a all filling meal!  And the service has always been good to excellent!"}
{"text":"It was dinnertime and after a drive to Vegas, attending a play, and check into the Cosmopolitan we were contemplating driving to our usual Chilies near the outlet mall south of the strip.  We saw this Chilies from our room at the Cosmopolitan and we were a little weary to go there after reading a few of the negative reviews on yelp.  But we were tired and hungry...and we decided to brave the 200 yard walk from the hotel to the restaurant on the strip.  We were very happy with this Chilies.  The view of the strip was nice, the restaurant was spacious, the design of the restaurant made it rather quiet (they have tall faux wall's between the adjacent booths), the staff was great, the food was typical great Chilies (2 for $20 fajitas), and the drinks were great and reasonably priced (Margareta's).  All and all a great night out.  The only negative was that after that massive meal and drinks...we had to WALK down the stairs to street level (they have only an up escalator to ferry you into the restaurant).  This is now on our go to list when staying on the pricey strip."}
{"text":"RJ is the best waiter I've ever experienced. Extremely personable and knowledgeable. He is definitely the reason why I will be coming back to this location. He made it extremely enjoyable, and I loved having him serve our table. I offered him a job at my company! Top notch."}

The margarita was average, maybe too sweet but there is tons of options for margaritas! The lunch vibe was cool and it wasn't too busy. Our server was attentive and sweet. The checkout process is so easy with the at table credit card machines. Overall I'll be back!"}

I can't remember the last time I had been to Chili's"}

My wife got some sort of chicken wrap that she barely ate. I got some sliders/mini burgers that weren't half bad, but very greasy and sloppily assembled. I'd take the Slider Truck over this any day. Our kid got chicken tenders, which were tough and rubbery. They have two types of chicken tenders on the kids menu. According to our waitress one is crispier than the other. I'm still wondering why they need two types of chic tenders on the menu (?????). Service was good. She stopped by often to check in. The food is cheap, which is the best selling point. Maybe I'll stop by again in another couple years."}
{"text":"I love Chili's. This location is iffy sometimes when it comes to service but the food is always good. I love the cheese steak and usually don't stray from that. Sometimes we order the sampler if we go during happy hour yo have some yummy munchables while sipping our margaritas.   I do love the options they have for blended drinks!  If you sign up for their e-mail list you can get cool coupons that are worth it and help a bit with the bill or allow you to try something you hadn't before."}
{"text":"When we entered the restaurant, the seating hostess stared at us without saying any words. I said hello and asked for a table for two people. She took us back to a table. Minutes later a waitress came by and said that the seating hostess did not tell her about us. The waitress apologized and was nice to us. For our appetizer we ordered the Skillet Queso Cheese dip with seasoned beef with warm tostada chips. The dip tasted as if it had beans rather than beef, but we liked it. I ordered the Southern Smokehouse Burger that had bacon and onion rings in it. My husband ordered the fajitas with chicken and steak. We both enjoyed the taste of these entrees. The waitress returned a couple of times to ask if we needed drink refills or anything else. When we left the restaurant, a different seating hostess was there, and she said goodbye to us."}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly generic. But nothing a bunch of salt could quickly fix. Add alcohol and the food gets even better to the point where you won't care how bad it really is!"}
{"text":"Went here Saturday afternoon, and it was pretty slow. The server was nice, and the fajitas were good...albeit a smaller portion than what Chili's used to serve. It is a clean bar with lots of seating."}
{"text":"What more can I say, it's Chili's nothing more or less. Basic bar and grill joint great for just hanging out. This location is usually busy because its on LV Blvd , however is close to 5 min from home. All in all its a nice place."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I can accurately describe how bad the food and the service was at this location. The waitress was clearly my in the mood to work. Our food took forever and why it did come out it came out in stages....ordered a burger with fries.  Burger came out, no fries. My husband ordered fajitas, beans and rice didn't come out.  When we asked our waitress where the rest of our meal was she said \"my brain isn't working\" Ok then, we'll take a break and figure it out. I didn't want to tell her what else she forgot since it took her so long to bring our food to begin with.  Chilis - GET WITH IT! Your reviews are not good. Your food is subpar and your staff sucks! We will not be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner with friends! Josh out server was exceptional and prompt with the food and drinks! All the food we ordered was fresh and delicious, wonderful evening all around. Great Job Josh and Chilis"}
{"text":"My parents used to take me here when I was younger, and I remember the food always being good. I just went here the other night for dinner, and I'll have to say, their quality has REALLY gone down hill.   My mom ordered the chicken fajitas. They tasted weird, not like how I remember. They really cut down the size of the fajita sides (sour creme, salsa, cheese ect.) I ordered the baby back ribs. They were seasoned very poorly. It was a sweet and salt rub, but not in a good way. My brothers hamburger was huge, and he loved it, which warrants at least the 2 stars.   Really sad this place isn't what it used to be."}
{"text":"I have done 2 pick up orders this month from this location. The food is always cold and always wrong. Both times I spoke to Chris, the manager and he was the least bit helpful. Worst customer service I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Usually I have a really good experience at Chili's but today was not that day. I ordered online like I normally do and went to pick it up. It wasn't ready which was no biggie. The very nice lady beings out the bag and half of my order is missing. I try to get her attention but failed so I hobbled in( I'm in a walking boot from a foot injury) and let her know that I missing my the other half of my order and the condiments that I requested online. She was nice and went and got it for me. She apologized and I left. I got home and opened the box and my quesadillas looked like my five year old son made them! It was just chicken and cheese even though I specified that I wanted onions and peppers. There is boxes that click if you want this. A few of them didn't even have chicken in them just cheese and they were warm almost cold enough that you knew they might have been sitting even though it wasn't ready. Now for a Saturday evening, I was surprised that they were not busy so I was confused as to why my food wasn't ready just to be warmish. Like I said, I usually have a pretty decent experience but last night wasn't so good. Let's get back to the standards I know you have Chili's."}
{"text":"Simple, quick and good! Of course we all know this place is no award winning restaurant, but for sure a place to enjoy some good food and one of my favorite places to chit chat with a friend or family and enjoy some Chicken Enchilada Soup. If you have not had the chicken enchilada soup you have not lived! Truly one of my favorite things to eat summer or winter!  I live downtown and we don't have a Chili's close so I went to visit with a fiend and enjoy soup and a prime rib bowl which was also very good.  We arrived and were told that they were  out of soup. We told our sever I drove all the way from downtown ( ok not hat far) and one of the only reasons we came. She said let me see what I can do. She came back with two bowls of soup!  Let me tell you that made my night!"}
{"text":"So my 12 year old kid decides that he loves bbq ribs and asks ( and asks and asks)  for me to take him to Chilis.    I think: Okay, it's close and it's cheap and he's a knucklehead kid who doesn't know great ribs from bad ones.   So I take him there.  The service is good and the food is hot.  He orders the ribs and digs in. About halfway thru the meal he looks up and says:    \"They're okay dad ... but I've had sooo much better.\"  Did I mention that he was 12?    Two Stars.....  because the server was a great kid doing the best she could."}
{"text":"Typical American fare with quick service.  Our whole team came here for lunch on a Wednesday (birthday girl's pick) and it was OK.  Chili's Grill and Bar offers a decent lunch combo menu that starts at $6 to $8.  Each comes with a soup or salad.  I decided on the chicken and  bacon quesadillas with chipotle ranch.  It came w/french fries and the soup I selected was a spicy chicken and sausage soup.  The server, who keeps calling everyone sweetheart, mentioned that there is a kick to this soup.  She made it sound like it's very spicy.  It is not.  There were four pieces of quesadillas with a side of fries.  I ate four pieces of quesadillas and was done with it.  I didn't like the chicken slices that were sandwiched between the tortillas.  I wish they had cubed the chicken rather than cutting it into thick slices.  Overall, Chili's good for those who enjoy typical American food.  I will pass next time though."}
{"text":"I ordered the Atlantic Salmon and it was pretty good. Also, my dining group ordered chips and salsa. Kudos for accommodating the vegetarian in our group. Pretty happy. The server was attentive and helpful. Everyone at my table ate EVERYTHING on their plate. Everyone was satisfied and were quite happy."}
{"text":"The quality of the hamburgers was poor-dried out to say the least.  The place was a dirty mess-the kitchen looked disgusting (floor and counters looked dirty) and so did the restaurunt!   I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Worst Chilies ever. Yes...it's true. At first I read these reviews and thought, \" geez it can't be that bad.\" Then I experienced the worst chilies I had ever been to. All the waitresses seemed rushed and confused. There was a politeness, but just seemed very rushed. Then we waited 40 mins for our food. Once it came I asked for some onions....I got the box and check before I ever got the onions. No apologies from the waitress, it took calling the manager over to get an apology.   To top it off, the food made my wife sick last night.   Won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I have had.i work in one of the busiest restaurants in Charlotte, I will leave the name out to save myself.but that will show how I know what I'm talking about.i ordered a beer at the bar and told the bartender that I would be ordering food to go as soon as I sat down, and yes I noticed that the bartender had a section along with the bar so I don't blame him at first for giving his tables attention, but ignored me after I told him this and turned his attention to his other tables and bar patrons.my beer was completely warm and when I ordered my food and informed the bartender I was not offered a replacement beer or anything he just took it away as if it was my fault, and after that I kindly asked to speak to a manager after leaving a more than 20% tip so again leaving no reason to be treated like an inconsiderate costumer, I was approached by the manager with my food togo and all she had to say was here's your food anything else I can get for you? I only mentioned my warm beer and how I also am a server so not being a pain and she came off as she didn't care and I was in the wrong.there was no consolation as an unhappy customer at all, had I not been a server and understood the business I would've made a complete scene.but the way I was treated even telling the manager that I was currently in the industry makes me feel like this establishment does not care about their customers and as long as they make enough to pay their cooks per hour they are ok.so please if any type of upper management see this review I would love to speak to you and explain this situation, again based on my job being based on reviews"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner around 10 pm on a weekday, restaurant was virtually empty except for a few patrons at the bar. I really liked how clean and bright it was inside, you don't get that daylight feel at too many restaurants nowadays.  We got seated right away and ordered drinks and a guacamole and chips. My drink was forgotten until I reminded the server when the appetizer came. The guacamole had big chunks of brown avocado in it which tainted the taste of the whole dip. We brought it up to the server who got the manager involved to help recover the problem. He offered to make us a fresh guacamole or take it off the check, of which we took the latter since our food would be out shortly.  I ordered the sliders which were decently good; I enjoyed the bread that they were on. My boyfriend ordered the buffalo chicken ranch sandwich. He thought it was pretty bland and couldn't really taste the ranch in it. For the quality and quantity of the ingredients on the sandwich, you would expect a lot more for $8.69.  The server tried his best to keep an eye on our table for the rest of the night but that couldn't change how satisfied we were since we went for food, not just service.  Overall, the chilis in Mesa has served much better food and service and we will only be returning to that location even though the driving distance is a difference of 5 minutes to Tempe vs 10 minutes to Mesa."}
{"text":"Always a good time here the staff is super friendly and quick. Food is good and at a great price I can't complain."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible experience... The managers don't care the server don't care . I got and appatiz and sides and they just charged me left and right for it. Like at the bottom it says it you get a side by it self it $1.99 and then they charged me extra $1 for substitution but I didn't substitute anything . they wouldn't budje for it I will not be back"}
{"text":"I love Chili's, like seriously love it. I go here about twice a week because I'm an active rewards member. My server Rebecca is great at being attentive to us. If I could give her five stars for her service I would. However, the female manager is very rude. She always has an upset look on her face. There is never a hostess at the front to seat us so I'm always waiting about three to five minutes to get a table. The appetizers are amazing but last time I went the tortillas for the fajitas were sticking together like if they were thrown into the microwave all together. The dessert was still cold on the inside when it was supposed to be a molten cake. I'm definitely not going to stop coming here but I hope that those issues are fixed."}
{"text":"Southwestern eggrolls and Chicken Ranch Quesadilla  were superb.  The service was excellent roo."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Chili's for a few years. One of my husband favorite places. I feel it is as good as most other Chains. Their egg roll appetizers are great."}
{"text":"At first I was really excited about my Chili's dinner because it was so simple and easy to order my food online, park in the designated to go parking spot, and walk right in to pick up my order. But I was wrong.   I had to call about five times and the line was still busy/off the hook. This is what forced me to place my order online.  It said it would be ready in ten minutes after placing my order. Being that it was Valentine's Day, the lady checking me out apologized that it would be 10-15 minutes longer since they got behind on orders. I didn't mind and sat on the bench and waiting only about five more minutes till she called my name.   The nice thing was that she opened each box up and repeated back my order.   The worst part was the presentation, the quality, and the incomplete order. That is the one thing I absolutely despise is when you get home and your order is either wrong or incomplete.  I order a kids meal with pizza and French fries. There was no drink she forgot to give me my drink. I also ordered the smokehouse deal with BBQ ribs, sausage and two sides. EVERYTHING was in one small box piled on top of one another. I want French fries and toast toast not BBQ flavored fries and toast that has BBQ sauce on it. Lastly, I ordered my usual Cajun chicken pasta. Of course they forgot my piece of toast that comes with it and it was cold. I couldn't help but be upset and left disappointed with this meal/experience.   I doubt I will go back to this Chili's. At least it'll be awhile until I go back and I won't ever order to go. I know and understand it gets busy but they need to be even more careful with their order and quality. Every plate should look and taste 110%."}
{"text":"Their web ordering seriously sucks. I entered my zip code and selected the nearest restaurant. I spent well over half an hour selecting the items I wished to order. I wanted to ask for no peppers on one item and no onion on another. THERE IS NO WAY TO DO THAT in your customization section. Not even a way to leave a note as a request. So we decided to suck it up and just pick them off later. I go to checkout and create a new account. I sign and and proceed to checkout. I'm told one of the items I selected isn't available at my location.... the why the HELL was it even presented as an option after having selected the location first? making matters worse, your site makes no indication as to WHICH of the EIGHT items isn't available. I finally figure out which one isn't available, and continue to check out. At which point, after all that time... AFTER HAVING SELECTED THE RESTAURANT I'D BE GOING TO AT THE VERY START OF THE PROCESS... I'm told that that restaurant ISN'T ACCEPTING ONLINE ORDERS and to call????? Ok. So, I call, give my name and number, and start listing items off. I'm stopped at the 3rd item and am given some excuse as to why they can't make it.... ANOTHER item on the menu this location will not serve! At this point, a full quarter of our order has been removed. I tell the server to just forget it and hang up."}
{"text":"Pretty decent spot. The staff is very attentive and have issue being ready and available for you. If you ever come here make sure you try the blackberry drink. It was amazing."}
{"text":"Came here with my family. No problem getting seated because the place was dead, got our drinks quickly and never saw our server again. Plenty of people walked by and tables seated after us got plenty of attention. Apparently our use of please and thank you meant we didn't actually want to eat"}
{"text":"Chili's is one of my favorites. I just wish they still had some sort of Caesar salad or chicken caesar salad."}
{"text":"If you don't go here and get the molted chocolate lava cake, you haven't lived. You haven't seen the light. This is my favorite dessert in the world. I literally solely go to this restaurant for this cake. The food is food-chainy (new adjective) but this little chocolate dessert is worth telling the world about. Served warm and gooey, with vanilla ice cream and topped with caramel and hard shell!!!! I want to shout it off the roof tops how delicious this treat is. Live your life, eat the cake."}
{"text":"Really, really awful experience here at this location. Grossly understaffed, dirty, unorganized dining room (with many unclean tables) and the worst service we may have ever had in Las Vegas- no joke. No drinks, no appetizers, no apologies, no anything (plus we waited over 10 minutes to be greeted). Manager presence was non-existent as well. I understand an \"off night\" in the hospitality industry but this was outrageous from start to finish. Not sure what has changed here recently but I can tell you several customers were very upset and quite vocal as well."}
{"text":"Used to be a great restaurant 20 years ago.  Everything now is disgusting:  food all over the floor from it never bring cleaned, there is dirt scum on the windows.  The tables are sticky and are wiped with cleanser which still leaves crumbs.  Had a steak fajita:  Meat was so tough to eat I had to stop.  Wife's food was average at best according to her.  We go to many restaurants and dont pay particular attention to these things.  But wow. Management here should be ashamed of this place.  I honestly don't know how they can pass inspection."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location in years. The changes to the menu looked pretty good.   The actual facility was pretty dirty. The menus were filthy too.   I ordered a burger and was pretty shocked at how small it was. Toppings were good. Fries were good too. Everything was pretty average I guess.   Overall it's about what I remembered of chilis. Haven't been missing much."}
{"text":"Such a great experience. It's really refreshing for the staff and manager to look out for their guests.  The manager (Orvell) was really nice and took the initiative to go above and beyond. Thank you! You Rock! We will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had planned on eating here because we have not been to Chili's in years.  We come in shortly after happy hour ends on a weekday.  It's a little busy, but there are many open tables.  We wait at the front of the restaurant... and wait... and wait...    We stand at the booth at the front waiting for someone to come for 5 minutes.  Finally, the hostess comes and says \"I'll be with you in a minute\" and leaves again.  We left.  Maybe we'll try going to a Chili's again in a few years.  Recent news stories have come out about how Millennials are \"killing\" chains like TGI Friday's, Applebee's, and Chili's; instead preferring cooking at home, ordering delivery, or fast food.  You know what part of the issue is?  Places like this where they just seem to think it's OK for there to be no host at the front for 5 minutes."}
{"text":"It is Chili's.  A chain restaurant.  Don't go expecting amazing, fresh and unique dishes.    We ate there on Superbowl Sunday about a half hour before kick off.  Which meant the restaurant was basically dead.  We had a \"server team\" that was taking care of us.  They were both attentive and quick with refills on water, pop and chips.  the only time that they took a while was when I asked for extra sauce for my chicken.  It took a lot longer than it should have considering the lack of crowd in the restaurant.  I tried one of the new \"healthy\" chicken entrees.  It was OK.  Chicken was moist and the guac and mango on the top added an extra flair, but I can't say I'd order it again.    I'm not the biggest fan of chili's, but my fiance loves it, so I know we'll be back."}
{"text":"Way to go Chilis you finally may have lost me as a customer... ordered Togo and get things home and fajitas are still raw and cold.... I live five minutes away!!!  Oh and the profanity coming out of your Togo kitchen is real nice as well it! And don't mind the server at the front who is obviously struggling by herself to take care of people why don't you put a few more people back in the back to laugh and curse and turn out piss poor food to your patrons! Will be a while before I'm back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was ridiculously slow. 15 mins to get our appetizer and another 20 minutes for our dinner...and there were open tables. The server was apologetic for the long wait. Seems like their kitchen needs to work on getting the food out faster. I watched a nearby table wait for almost 15 minutes for chips and salsa.  Food came out and was luke warm. My husband's pasta was cold in spots and the cheese was congealed it had sat so long.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Good bar pup chow.  Well prepared.  New menu seems much smaller, more limited.  Quality items remain.  Service was timely and attentive.  Appetizers are standard and good.  Burgers well made.  Fajitas generous in portion.  Did not have room for dessert."}
{"text":"Our dinner tonight was great. Our server in the bar area was great we had southwest egg rolls and I had Chipotle honey chicken and waffles and it was great."}
{"text":"Based on service this review would really be a 2.5.  But solid bar food and all day Happy Hour on Sundays brings it to a solid 3.  Upon entering it took a while to even be acknowledged at the door and seated and by no means was this place crowded.  There were maybe two tables I could see in the restaurant area and the bar area had about four to five.  Once we were acknowledged we were immediately led to the restaurant portion.  After seating us and getting our drink order the waiter finally came back and I asked him if there were any specials.  At this time he mentions Happy Hour but only in the bar.  Now, I'm thinking at this point you could have saved us both some time by letting us know that option at the door.  I mean, I get it, you make more money if we sit in the restaurant side but we had no intention of ordering anything but appetizers anyways.  Once we were seated on the bar side service was fine if not a bit slow.  What turns me off about Chili's is the customer service.  They serve you and expect a tip, which the waitress gave instructions on how I could add that on the table computer so obviously paying the tab is self-serve unless you are paying cash.   But to me this takes away from the customer service aspect a little bit, like they are too busy to bring me a paper bill and add to that the machine was out of paper so I didn't even receive a receipt."}
{"text":"Went here today with friends and family. I love that they have so many different options on the menu that it's perfect for those that are eating healthy and those that are not. Service is always great here as well and I like their lunch specials. Everything on the menu is good priced.   I got the chicken fajitas. It's one of my favorite dishes. Simple but so much flavor. My friends got the quesadilla explosion salad and the margarita salad that  they both enjoyed. My fiancé tried one of the seasonal BBQ dishes with the sausage and crispers and didn't care for it. It was small portions and pretty bland.   I recommend to go with the classics here food wise, can't go wrong! But great place to have options. Good lunch specials, happy hour, and to go."}
{"text":"This is the worst Chilis we've ever gone to. We normally try to avoid this location at all costs because we almost always get horrible service. Like just now... sat down waited 15 minutes and one guy looked at me and said oh hold on and walked off. We left!"}
{"text":"Great service  manager Shawn was very nice with helping out staff as I noticed  quick timing on everything"}
{"text":"Meh, it was alright.   Not too sure what I'm expecting at Chilli's these days.   I ordered the chilli tacos they had on special or whatever...  I didn't realize it was chilli inside of a taco hahaha! So, that was exactly what it said it was.  We ordered the watermelon vodka drinks and those were stellar. Yay, booze!   The server was friendly and attentive although, it's Chilli's.... not the same Chilli's one might recall from back in the day, it's the newer version and if you're like me, the memory is better than what it's become over the years."}
{"text":"This review is for the nachos. Wow they are salty and terrible.  The poor cook painstakingly put meat, tomatoes and cheese on individual chips and put them under the broiler. Their hard work was wasted as I just wanted chips with toppings piled on with cheese all over the place.  Plus it was incredibly salty."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here.  I used to just get chicken fingers and burgers and although they are good, they get boring.  So I started reaching out to the tex-mex items and wow they're good!  I have had the short rib enchiladas, BBQ chicken enchiladas and crispy chicken tacos and they have always been flavorful and hot.  Very surprised they came from a chain restaurant. Their crispy tacos are seasoned with taco seasoning which adds a good flavor.  Sometimes the wait staff forgets something or makes a mistake but they always correct it quickly.  Sign up for Chili's emails for bi-weekly coupons for free appetizers, fajita upgrade & free kids meals."}
{"text":"Ill keep it simple!  PROS: Good ambiance, Clean, Friendly staff New digital menu and easy to pay pods.  New Menu with new items.   CONS  Only one and it overrides every PRO they have. Food is ridiculously bad. Oily, onions on the grill item not sauteed right. Fish was undercook and smelly with half a pot of red chilis sprinkled on top. Only good thing we got on our table was the Flatbread and the dessert in the end. The steak and Chicken fajita steak doesnt look anything like in the menu picture. It looks like a kids version of the picture with no seasoning and oily onions. Who is cooking this stuff in the back? Seriously, you can get better food at McDonalds. I hope they find a better chef or train the ones they have the right way.   Im giving it 2 stars because the manager was nice enough to take the fish off our bill.. I actually wanted to send the whole table back. We were there to eat, not to waste 1 hour and get half cooked fish."}
{"text":"My friends seem to always suggest chilli's. There food isn't the best in the world, but it will do in a pinch. The 2 for $20 is where it's at. There chips and salsa are not bad at all. Surprisingly, the salsa is pretty good. Weird, I know. Overall good service and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great place for groups. They were so helpful and helped us to make our event on time. Great customer service and same chilli's food. Great location for your next event or dinner. Stop by and give them a try!"}
{"text":"I will admit, we visited this location 2 weeks ago. My boyfriend, my son and I. Service was absolutely terrible. I walked out of never wanting to see another Chilis in my life. Still upset I decided to give the restaurant manager a phone call. I didn't call to receive a free meal or a gift card or anything like that. I simply wanted to bring to his attention the type of service we had just received. Champ encouraged us to come back and I must say I am extremely happy we decided to give Chilis another try. He took care of us and our waitress was great. I really appreciate Champ coming by our table several times during our visit to make sure everything was okay.   Thanks Champ. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Hello I was in this chilli today as I have been eating at chili's since 2000 and I received the best service at  this one food was good, service was great and watched the game and now I use my rewards all the time not sure why inconsistent  reviews ....keep up the good job"}
{"text":"Well, I have been her numerous times and have always been satisfied.  However, tonight an event that made me download the yelp app.  My wife ordered a salad and she discovered a fingernail in her salad.  I couldn't believe, I though it was a stem of some sort.  Upon further inspection I can confirm relying on my 30 plus years of finger nail bitting,  it was indeed a fingernail.  Distusting.  We provided the finger nail to the waitress who said it was probably a stem.  I agreed it could be and suggested she took it to the back and have others take a look then come back and tell us the results.  She never came back with the results and she acted like nothing happened.  I laughed, my kids laughed, my poor wife sat staring at us eating our food like a little puppy.  No manager came over, no offer to take it off the receipt... nothing.  Very dissapointed,  won't be coming back.  Well, maybe for a mani pedi when they are low on salad ingredients.  Blahhhh.  My food was good so I'll give them 2 stars."}
{"text":"This place is a little more then your typical Chillis. They seem to have very little turn over in staff and it shows in the quality of servers. Everyone is very nice and they do a great job. Always clean, always quick with the food, highly recommend. If I could move the entire staff to a non-chain restaurant with great food then they would get all 5 stars.  **Tip** If possible- always, ALWAYS, sit in the bar area. Even with kids. Seriously."}
{"text":"I always loved Chili's in New Jersey.....so as I was driving on Shea Blvd, I saw my old friend.  I drove right into a perfect parking space in front of the take-out door.  Hooray!!!! No one was on line.    What do I want...... Yesssss! Quesadilla Explosion Salad.... with extra dressing and extra cheese.   The waitress was very nice and when my order was completed she came around the counter (with a smile) and handed it to me!    Now the main attractions.... The Salad wasn't the BEST.... the lettuce was wilted, the chicken was ice cold (considering I live in a HOT area) ....  Needless to say it wasn't the same Chili's as I remembered!!!"}
{"text":"We started with the spinach queso dip. It was decently good. I mean how can you go wrong with melted cheese? The cheese in the dip was a white cheese that had a mild flavor that went well with the spinach that was nicely chopped up in the dip. My favorite part was the scoop of guac in the center of the dip. Unfortunately, the guac was mostly one hard piece of avocado. I had to use my knife to cut it down to scoopable chip sized pieces. To make the queso dip better, I think maybe adding some garlic flavor to it should do the trick. The dip came with a large basket of chips and a small bowel of salsa. I have always loved Chili's chips. They are so thin, yet so crispy.   For dinner, we ordered the honey chipotle Chicken Crispers and a fresco side salad. The honey chipotle Chicken Crispers came served on top of waffles and were topped with applewood bacon, jalapeños and green onions.  The honey chipotle sauce was surprisingly spicier than I thought it would be, which I liked. The were supposed to drizzled with ancho-chile ranch, but I didn't really notice any ranch anywhere so it either wasn't there or was really lightly drizzled. The chicken was really good. It was nice and moist on the inside. The waffles were ok, nothing to write home about. The waffle were kind of dry and a little on the dense side. The crispers came with a side of homestyle fries and a side of honey chipotle sauce. I drizzled the extra honey chipotle sauce over my waffles to give it more flavor and help moisten them up a bit. I liked the sauce so much I also dipped my fries in it. The fresco side salad was a basic spring mix salad topped with queso fresco dressed in a honey lime vinaigrette. For a side salad, it was a decent size. It was refreshing and helped break up the heavy dinner and appetizer. I really liked the dressing that was on it.   We got our leftovers to go and our waiter brought out a bag for our chips and had some extra chips in the bag for us! OMG! Chips! I love that their bags are tailored for reheating their chips in the microwave so you can have hot chips at home!  Our waiter was awesome. It think his name was Martino? (I am so sorry if that was not your name) It was like he could read my mind. Everything I needed before I even needed to ask for it or even before I knew I needed it. I wish he could be my waiter everywhere I go. 5 stars for you!"}
{"text":"My family and I visited this Mesa Riverview location on Sunday, March 8, 2015 around 4 PM. Our server was amazing and very friendly. After ordering our food, a gentleman which looked like a manager since was not in uniform was assisting her bring out our food. He did not even say one word to us while giving us our food, but just put the food on the table without even verifying which meal goes to who. As he handed me a plate, I informed him that the plate was not mine, he said, \"well this plate is hot and this looks the same as the other one.\" He just put the plates down and walked away. I find that very rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"Chicken(Country)-Fried Steak, To Go! Drive Home took approximately 45 seconds. Upon opening container and cutting first piece, the entire breading-type covering, which was over and inch thick, completely came off the McDonald's Hamburger-sized beef patty. I even had gravy on the side, so it wasn't soggy from the gravy.   Are you kidding me? How difficult is it to fuck up a Chicken Fried Steak?  Totally ruined and a waste of time & money. Threw it away!"}
{"text":"For an airport Chili's, it's fine.  Not great, not terrible.  I came in at about 5:30am and the place was doing business.  I wanted to grab a little something before my flight and it did it's job.  I got a breakfast burrito.  It was tasty, had bacon, eggs and potatoes.  The only thing that was a bit odd was that it also came with extra potatoes.  Apparently I didn't have enough in the burrito.  The place itself was clean looking.  The staff was attentive.  The bar area was very nice to sit at.  You can do a lot worse in an airport."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Our waiter not cooperating with us and clearly getting annoyed at us for taking the time to tell the waiter our choice of drinks and appetizers. Employees have no patience. Also had an annoyed tone when talking"}
{"text":"The service and food are pretty good. If you've been to another chili's and enjoyed it you wont be disappointed.  If you've never been to chili's before, where have you been living under a rock? Anyway its good food at a moderate price. Pretty casual date location. Nothing fancy but they have a decent bar."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area, and I am a server so I know good reviews don't go unnoticed. We had Christopher as our server tonight, and he was wonderful! He kept our drinks filled and checked on us often. We only had to wait about 5 mins to be seated, which is great for it being a Friday night. Food was delicious, no complaints over here. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Different experiences at different times and different days and even different parts of the restaurant. I guess some servers have it and some don't. What I look for in a sit-down eatery is someone who checks up, roughly 12-15 mins apart, make sure drinks are always full, and be a little friendly. Well, it doesn't always work out at this Chili's but my experience has never been bad. Just lacking sometimes."}
{"text":"I've always felt this location had some great service every time we've been there. The servers are always full of laughs and help you out pretty well. Once in awhile there will be a sour greeter, but that doesn't take away too much of the experience."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with the boyfriend on a Monday night!   Samantha G was our waiter and helped us when we had many, many questions about the menu.   The only downfall was the star berry lemonade. It was watered down to the core.   Will definitely be returning! Hopefully this location has fixed their roof leaks, too!"}
{"text":"Slow..... Even on a slow day!  Tuesday at 430 pm.. I'm falling asleep, I even called 20 min in advance! Iam  giving them 3 stars because the food was good, I love some baby backs....Service, not so good."}
{"text":"I haven't been to many chilis restaurants in my life but I enjoy coming here for a bowl of soup and a cold drink .  Maybe an item or two off their happy hour menu.  They have a small lunch menu that really could use some work .  Today I had a 6 dollar half turkey sandwich with fries .  Nothing amazing but it was tasty and the price was on point."}
{"text":"Small parking lot and difficult to find from the road but I really enjoyed my experience here.  If you sign up for their new rewards program, every time you visit a chilis you can have a free chips and salsa or a non alcoholic beverage. I think that's a great deal.  Of course we had the bottomless chips and salsa.  Their chips are always super salty but the salsa is delicious. Sometimes I just want to come for the chips and salsa and the chicken enchilada soup.  They have a $10 special going on right now that I also took advantage of.  It includes a choice of a non alcoholic beverage, soup or salad, and a choice of entree. (From a list of 6). I had the honey chipotle chicken crispers and it came with fries and corn on the cob. All this for $10 is a great deal. It was plenty of food and I had left overs for lunch the next day. I really like their chicken enchilada soup. I wish I could make it at home.   Customer service was great as well.  Chili's is one of my preferred chain restaurants and I will be returning to this one as long as the service stays this stellar! In case you can't see it from Tyvola Road, it's right behind the exotic car dealership and next to Costco. Happy dining!"}
{"text":"We were seated quickly and our waitress was super nice.   My expectations for airport food was not very high and was not great as expected. My husband and I both ordered the breakfast with eggs, potatoes, pancakes and bacon.   Eggs were good and potatoes were good.  The bacon was okay and I did not like the pancakes very much.    It was quick though and there are limited options here."}
{"text":"Awesome.   Salmon and asparagus was hot n amazing.  Mac n cheese n ice cream always a favorite for kids. Fast, cheap, great service"}
{"text":"We came in for dinner. Sat at the bar tonight which was Monday night football and the Golden Knights game was on. Michelle, who was the bartender did an exceptional job of getting everyone's favorite team on all the TVs for everyone to watch! Thank you Michelle for being a great bartender! See you next time. Keep Rockin!"}
{"text":"Usually a good place but lately the service and food have been poor.  The chips are greasy and in pieces, they are out of soup but have no vegetarian option.  They are out of 4 other options and don't tell you until you wait for 20 minutes for your food."}
{"text":"I have had some good food here but a few years back they went downhill in quality especially noticeable in their burgers.   So I pointed it out to management and they gave me some bs about how I must have just hit a bad day or something and no apology or compensation for a disappointing meal.    Anyway, I haven't been back in years but recently stopped in for a burger and the menu was changed and the burger I ordered was enormous and quite good.  Not sure yet about the other burgers but it looks like they have corrected some things.   Service was a little slow but ok.   Food took a little while but finally arrived after say 15 min?   I'd rather wait 15 for properly prepared food than get something quick and not properly prepared.  Everything was super hot.  Yum! They have some techno gadget on the table that serves as a sort of menu/gamebox/call for order thing.  I just pushed it aside.   Does anyone know what this is all about?  I thought it was kind of weird."}
{"text":"I give this two stars only because the waitress was great.  We went in and sat in the bar area at one of the empty tables,  all four of which were dirty.  We sat there ten minutes and no one came over.  We went back to the front and sat in the restaurant area.  The kiosk was a pain to use and had to call over the waitress to help.  The manager, Roland, never came over to ask how our meal was even though he walked by several times.  I finally waved him down to ask a question and he seemed to brush me aside.  Other Chilis were not this way.   Also a coupon I had on my phone did not work properly after trying to get the manager to assist us.  Zero stars for the manager!!!"}
{"text":"I got to use my reward points to have two free lunches today!  The lunch specials were really good and the waitress was attentive. That damn kiosk on the table I couldn't figure out to use so The waiter and waitress had to come over to help me.   All the servers kept my tea full and I ended up drinking three of them.   The service was very quick for lunch so if you only have an hour you can get in and out very fast."}
{"text":"I want to establish something before I review my dining experience here:  It doesn't matter how hard I slam this place.  No one that works there can do ANYTHING about it.  If you stocked Chili's with the greatest waitstaff, the greatest chefs, the greatest managers, the greatest dishwashers, et cetera, NONE of them could change the fact that the food is terrible.  So, people of Chilis:  I salute your service.  I am positive that you do your best, every day, to squeeze this fat sloppy pig into that prom dress.  I appreciate everything you tried to do, and I tipped you well.  This being said...  How can I describe my experience here?  Friendly staff: helpful, quick, efficient, wonderful people, all of them.  Really.  The food?  Well.  First off.  Their chips and salsa is bad.  If I bought the least appealing salsa at the grocery-store, and the least appealing chips off the shelf, and put them into a wax-paper lined bowl, it would be very similar to this \"dish\".    Now.  Ask yourself:  if the chips and salsa are bad...  how bad can the.,..  Fried shrimp be?  Pretty bad.  It comes with fries and cole slaw.  The fries?  The fries are fries.  Eh.   The cole slaw?  Pretty bad.  All together, it looked like a plate of \"brown\" and a ramekin of shredded white, purple, and orange credit cards.   The shrimp tasted like... nothing.  Like chewy nothing and fried batter that squished when you chewed it.  The cole slaw?  Like crunchy nothing and mayonnaise.    Even the cocktail sauce was bad.  Do I deserve this?  I mean...  shrimp from Chilis?  Even though the Atlantic Ocean is 4 hours due east, I bet that stuff came from some processing center in Texas.  It was DOA weeks ago when it was bagged, packed into boxes and flash-frozen.  All together...  I think it was about $20.00 because the drinks are jacked up.  Two sodas=like 5 bucks, right?  Off about 3 cents worth of carbonated water and flavored syrup.  They always make money on the drinks...  For the price, the food was awful.  Truly awful.  Burgers that went to other tables LOOKED eatable, but still...  I can't help but keep thinking...  if the chips and salsa is bad...  what else is bad?"}
{"text":"My steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned and David made the night! Perfect food and service. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow. Went there at 3pm, like 3 other patrons in the whole place, but it still took ten minutes to get 2 margaritas. On the plus side, they were good when they finally came. Bartender felt bad and made them super strong for our second round. But that ten minute wait was a real drag."}
{"text":"I came here for an early dinner with a friend and it was a night and day difference from my earlier lunch dining experience at OC. We got there before the dinner rush and got a great booth. Our waitress was attentive and helpful. Our meal was good, a hamburger with great flavor and the house salad was good. For dessert we got the Molten Chocolate Cake...Oh my goodness!! It was so GOOD! If you go to Chili's make sure to leave room for this dessert!! The chocolate cake was sweet, moist and warm, the ice cream had a soft chocolate shell and complimented the warmth of the cake with a cool creamy ending.   I might just come back for the dessert. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Really the only chain restaurant I visit often. This location is very consistent, good food, good service and I've never waited for a table. Their classic margarita is probably the best $4.00 Rita you can buy anywhere. I recommend the jalapeño smokehouse burger! Always good and only 9 bucks."}
{"text":"Came with appetizers and soup.  Just wanted to munch on something small.  The tables were so close, I had to have my husband move the table so I can breathe.  The server was good.  The food was good.  Got the trio-sampler:  Southwest eggrolls, chicken wings, and potato skin.  I got the chicken enchilda soup."}
{"text":"We came here after a long day of shopping and freezing!!!  All 4 of us felt like soup and apps.  We were greeted right away and seated right away.  Cool!  The server came to welcome us and took our drink orders.  She seemed to be in a rush and a little short with us, okay!  She came back with our drinks and took our food order.  She seemed irritated that we were only ordering soups and an app.    Chicken Enchilada Soup - It was good, but again a tad salty for me.   Triple Dipper:  Wings Over Buffalo - Good and spicy                            Fried Cheese - Good and gooey                            Original Chicken Crispers - Good and cripsy  The server's attitude bring down the mood."}
{"text":"No complaints. Came in with 3 adults and 4 children. They have kids eat free on Tuesdays which is why we came. I ordered a 6oz sirloin with broccoli. Although it wasn't incredibly filling it tastes good. Prices are reasonable and made affordable for a family with a lot of kids to enjoy a meal out."}
{"text":"So overall my visit was okay at best. My waitress was friendly, she was good on refilling drinks. Now I don't know who to really blame for the slow service on everything else. My waitress to start got my order wrong. I ordered steak quesadilla received chicken. Normally I wouldn't make a fuss but when your craving one thing something else just won't cut it. Especially since I'm paying $10 for quesadilla come on I don't think it's that hard. Needless to say I had to wait a ridiculous amount of time for them to correct my order. And since they took so long my kids finished their meals before I even got mine. My husband waited for me so by the time I got my food his was cold. so then the waitress brings the check and goes oh did he come by? I'm like no no one came by. And she goes oh well he took the order off. Okay cool. I look at the check no they did not. They took off the chicken quesadilla order and did nothing to compensate messing up my order and taking forever to receive my food. Then we go to pay using their machine and it tried to add a 20% tip. Ummm no sorry I changed that to 0%. Sorry but she could of accommodated us more for her mistake. Also beware of those machine if you have kids at the table. They charge for games and don't even tell you  it will cost you money."}
{"text":"Why not 2 or 3 stars you ask? Maybe because of the excellent customer service we received.  The drink specials for happy hour are great and the food... Yup pppppop, rare sirloin steak all the way. Ask for Brent he's awesome."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, had to wait an extra 30 minutes for to go order, order was incomplete and manager had nothing but excuses, don't waste you money go to Cheddar"}
{"text":"The service was great, very helpful and prompt. The lunch menu is awesome, good options, nice portions, great prices. Comfortable atmosphere, a little chilly but that's better than to warm."}
{"text":"Straight fire boi. Everything is on point here, food so bomb. 5/5  - the great Anthony L"}
{"text":"I went for lunch with my husband.  Didn't feel it was very clean or anything over the top.  The hostess had her hand on a piece of my salad when she brought t to the table.  Our waitress was not friendly . I don't think we will be back knowing there are better options for food and service elsewhere.   We had a gift card so that's the end of that."}
{"text":"First time I have been to chili's in over 20 years. I now remember why I stopped coming here. Foods decent. I had the honey chipotle boneless wings. I may have expected more. Better quality but it is Chili's. Celery was pretty nasty. French fries were cold. Oh well, worth a try. Beer was great. :)"}
{"text":"This is the second time that I have place a curbside pickup at Chili's and it has not been ready. This time I went into the restaurant to find out what was the hold up my food was sitting on the counter the young man that was assisting me asked if I'd like to speak to a manager and I said yes. John the kitchen manager came out to address the issue and kept apologizing with no resolve. He then try to explain to me that there's no way of them knowing that someone's here on the curb without using the app for Chili's and indicating that I have arrived. But when you place your order you give a description of the vehicle that you are arriving in along with your phone number so therefore when I called and indicated to the gentleman after to go that I was here and ready he said he will ran my food out so after 20 minutes I decided to go into the restaurant to find out what was the holdup and low and behold my food was sitting on the counter. John stated to me he just brought my food out 5 to 10 minutes ago. Then I ask John did you not see a black car in the to go spot for curbside? Then he went back to explaining to me how I should have used the app. Probably one of the worst customer service I've ever seen possible. And then once I was about to leave he asked if I would like for him to remake my food I said why would I do that I've sat here for over 40 minutes waiting. He then said I can send you out a gift card for your next visit can you fold your name address and phone number while I'll take the customer behind you. He had no type of courtesy for my needs at the present time he was more focused on the customer behind me and getting me out of the establishment I would never ever ever go back to Chili's and I suggest everyone else do the same."}
{"text":"So Ive been to Chilli's several times, and I am not a big fan of there food!   Ive ordered several different items such as there mouth bite burgers, there chicken fried steak, and the ribs...So Ive definitely given them plenty of chances every visit I have been disappointed!!! It taste like a microwavable dinner! Food is rubbery and tasteless! YUCK   On the other hand I do still return for the bar!   I must admit I do LOVE there appetizers/drinks!!!   I LOVE there Southwestern Eggrolls mmm mmm good so yummy!!! There stuffed with chicken,black beans,corn and jalapeno jack cheese, and is served with this delicious avocado ranch dressing.   I also love there Crispy Onion Strings & Jalapeno Stack very very tasty especially after having a few Presidente Margaritas! MMMM I love the Presidente Margaritas they come in a shaker and you can poor as you go and there very delicious!   So overall this place is great if your just coming for some snacks and some drinks, unless your a fan of microwavable food!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep this one short and simple.  Ive been here a dozen times and never been disappointed nor have I been amazed. Its just like your regular chain restaurant good food not great but good, good service, and good prices. I always order something different every time I come here and have never not liked the food. I usually start with an appetizer like the jalapeno onion strings or there southwest egg rolls mmm those egg rolls are so yummy! As for the main course Ive had it all Chicken fried steak, mini sliders, crispy chicken crispers and recently their new cajun chicken pasta. All were good but let me tell you the new cajun pasta is delicious its creamy goodness and their very generous with the chicken its definitely a must try!   So overall cant really go wrong with this place for a cheap decent meal."}
{"text":"My Fiance and I love this Chili's. Mainly for the drinks and Chips -N- Salsa! The food is ok. We love the appetizers the most. We have only had one bad experience here with service. My favorite drink is the blueberry pineapple margarita and Tito's punch! Always excellent!"}
{"text":"My husband and stopped in for a late Sunday dinner on March 6th. We were pleasantly surprised by how helpful and nice our waiter was and how clean the restaurant was.  We asked for the special: 2 entrees for $20.00 and included with that is a appetizer. I ordered the half rack of barbecued baby back ribs with corn on the cob and coleslaw. My husband ordered a classic bacon burger with fries. Afterwords we decided on a dessert: we ordered the molten chocolate cake; both us drank ice tea which was very fresh and good. This restaurant has good service and great food.  I like Applebee's, their food, their employees and the general layout of their store.  We will return to this location."}
{"text":"Table of 7 and everybody had complaints about their food. Chicken under cooked, pasta to hard, food was cold, chicken looked boiled instead of grilled and etc. One person got his food after everybody finished eating. Everybody was sitting with empty cups from beginning to end... HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Soup was good though."}
{"text":"I'd give it 3 1/2 stars. Ate there today. Our first time ever at a Chili's. I gave them kudos right off the bat because our soda and iced tea did not come with a straw already in the drink. (I've been trying to make it a habit of refusing straws at restaurants because they are an environmental nightmare.) I was in the mood for a beer. Their selection was the usual cheap crappy fare, but the menu said ask about their craft brew menu. Our waitress apologized because she said, well, they don't really have one. They only had a Sam Adams on that \"craft beer menu.\" She was great; attentive and very pleasant. We got the endless tortilla chips and salsa. They were pretty good. The salsa had just enough kick and the homemade chips were light and crispy. My bf had the ribs. He gave them a thumbs up. I had a buffalo chicken sandwich. My only complaint for our whole meal was the lettuce that came on my sandwich. I absolutely hate when restaurants serve brown lettuce and also use mostly the white core part-yuck! Woulda given a solid 4 stars as far as it being a decent chain restaurant, if not for that sad iceberg lettuce. I try not to eat at many chains but we were hungry and driving thru on Rt. 100, so we stopped there."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Chili's in forever. We have a gift card, so here we go.   My husband was excited to try the new burgers they advertise. H ordered the chili cheese burger which came with fries. The burger looked and tasted amazing. It definitely was the old fashioned chili circa 1975.  I ordered the $7 lunch special double burger which came with fries and a choice of soup or salad. Everything was great  There are a lot of $7 lunch choices  If you sign up for the loyalty club, you get a free soft drink or chips and salsa on every visit."}
{"text":"Kinda shocked! The restaurant isn't as good as it used to be. Three of us went for a late lunch on Friday (2 pm).  We ordered the Southwest egg rolls. Didn't seem to have the same crunch as usual. They were brought to the table without little plates. I was finally able to get someone's attention after about five minutes.   Our entrees were a chicken salad, Old timer burger, and a sirloin steak. My husband pronounced the salad as \"okay\" and ate half of it.  The burger I had was virtually tasteless. I have to believe they've changed the meat they're buying. My daughter ordered her steak as medium. It came out very bloody and hard to cut. She gave up and asked for it to be cooked a little longer. To their credit, they brought her a new steak. It was exactly like the prior one, so she asked for a box.  Servers were pleasant. Overall, we were all disappointed in a place we've been going to for more than 10 years. Not worth the cost. Also, I couldn't log my points so we just paid the bill and left due to an appointment."}
{"text":"East side Chilis is the best one, way better than west side. I've eaten here at least 20 times and it is rare to find something wrong.  Love the potatoe soup and chips/salsa."}
{"text":"Went to Chili's for lunch with a few friends after school, and we all ordered water and then later my friend decided to order a different drink and the waitress acted as if it was huge hassle. I had asked to have a order of chips and salsa and she turns to me with attitude and says \"So that will be on your bill\". She said you can swipe your card on the little kiosk or cash, and we told her we were paying with cash. Then we had to wait 30 minutes to get our check. Also the chicken crisper's were anything but crispy."}
{"text":"WORST experience ever with a well established chain restaurant.  Only deserving of a 1 because of the digital game on the table which thankfully kept my grandsons busy and the guacamole which was very good.  We were seated right away...  After 10 minutes of waiters walking past us looking mer right in the eye I had to ask the gal that seated us if we had a waiter!  Really?  It took another 5 minutes for one to show up who rather begrudgingly announced that he would be helping 'so and so' out tonight.  We still had NO water and NO silverware which once again I had to ask for!!  We got the chips and salsa with the guacamole.  I will say the guacamole was delicious.  So after 20 minutes we finally had something to eat.  It took another 20 minutes to get our food. I got the pork fajitas which clearly had been sitting in water to stay moist.  Disgusting.  The boys had chicken tenders which were tough, dry and cold.  The table to the left of us got a completely wrong order.  Not a mix up.  The waiter simply didn't write it down correctly and blamed it on the man for not understanding him!  I want to add that when the table next to us was seated a man with the group announced to the waiter that if the service and food were as bad as their last experience they would never be back!  The waiter blamed it on the latest management!  WHAT?  You are a lousy ruder waiter because of your management?    Well there you go!  Do yourself a favor...  Save your time and money and stay away! I know we will NEVER go back.  Too horrible to even give them a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. I called and ordered cajun chicken pasta from the take out side. Once I got there they handed me shrimp tacos.. not even close to what I ordered. I tell the girl at the counter that I ordered cajun chicken pasta and she puts in a order for cajun shrimp pasta! I tell her again for the third time that I would like cajun chicken pasta. Finally she gets it correct and I take my food home to eat and it was terrible! There were chunks of what looked like ground beef in my food and I was just disgusted. I threw my pasta out and was going to eat my bread and the bread had pink mold. I have never been more disgusted with a food place. I will not be returning to Chilis."}
{"text":"It's always good, clean, quick and great staff.also like the to go window. Love their fresh chips and sals to take home and nicely wrapped"}
{"text":"Jason was AMAZING!!! The best server we've had in years.  He made our dining experience SO much fun n memorable for father's day.  Happy hour is ALL DAY for Sunday.  So come in when u wake up and ENJOY.    Ask for Jason.  You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"This review gets an extra star because our server was awesome. We came on Sunday which is all day happy hour. $3.75 wells, $4.50 house margs, and $1 off everything else. The waitress recommended the Palomar and presidente Margarita. The Margarita was very good, and  the Palomar was so-so (pretty weak on the grapefruit flavors).  We ordered from the 2 for 20 menu, so pretty typical food. They do have an allergen menu, which is really nice. Nothing outstanding about the food, but it did the job.  Service was awesome, our waitress was really nice, and warned us up front that the kitchen was running behind (we didn't have anywhere to be, but I appreciated the frankness. She also gave us an extra plate of chips to hold us over until our entrees came).  Overall a happy experience, would definitely go back because food on the strip can get spendy, and service / drink prices  were great"}
{"text":"If you've been to one you've been to them all. Staff was pretty courteous, but totally clueless. Our server even acted a bit annoyed we didn't order our drinks or appetizers through their tabletop robot machine thing. Sorry...but are we even supposed to tip for that?"}
{"text":"First time here. I've historically had bad experiences with Chili's.   Not today.  Food was decent.  I had the turkey club which I couldn't finish and a side salad.  (Plus Bloody Mary).    Best part of the meal was the service.  Nicole is great.  And easy on the eyes! :)"}
{"text":"By far the worst food v ever had at a restaurant.  Every single dish on our table i tried was terrible.  From my moms sliders to my sisters mac and cheese to my brothers smoked wings and my terrible over priced steak and shrimp.   I literally wanted to throw up once i tried my brothers wings.  Our waitress was not exactly personable last night but she would bring us refills every few minutes when we were not even close to being finished with our second drink.  The food on a slow night beware takes at minimum 30 min for your food.  Ive never seen a place so dead take so long to get our food out.  Definitely do not want to return to any chilis after that experience."}
{"text":"Almost everything was great and enjoyed workout issue, waiters and waitresses always had refills on lock, and the food was made exactly how everyone ordered it.  Some new things I've never seen before like tablets with free games on them for kids were at the tables.  Over all a great restaurant  experience, my family knows we can always count on chili's to deliver."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar on a Tuesday around 2.. it was not too busy and everything was good!"}
{"text":"We had a good experience at Chili's. I was a little hesitant due to previous reviews, but we went and everything was great. I had the chili and salad, my husband the potato soup, my mother enjoyed the California chicken flat bread and dad had the steak. Everything was tasty and hot. Service was fast. There was a wait, but it was busy so understandable. We were able to play games while we waited and we paid on the machine so fast exit as well."}
{"text":"I tried there new prime rib  stuffed burrito but was not impressed. I would suggest the chips and salsa and pork tacos. Serve is usually pretty good here."}
{"text":"Bad service... bad food... This place doesn't even make it on the back up to all back ups list. The servers are rude and the food sucks. I knew there was a reason that I haven't been to Chili's in a long time. I will never try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This will probably be my last time eating at a Chilis. You cannot get butter for potatos or brocoli or whatever. Just some tastless grease that you pass off as butter. How pathetic. I spend 3 weeks of every month on the road and eat out every night. You're losing money inspite of the good service."}
{"text":"Our Server was very nice!! But we walked in Sunday to watch the Az Cardinals play ! We walked in the bar and Michael the bartender was wearing a Broncos shirt! The Az Cardinals game was in 2nd Qtr with no sound on ! The sound was on for the broncos game of course ! The broncos game was on 3 tvs on the bar area when there were many games playing and the Cardinals were on one! We were sitting at a booth in the bar area and I asked if we could change the 3rd TV on the broncos game to NASCAR to check the score my server said sure went to Michael and Michael said absolutely NOT!!! As a paying costumer who frequents this location often was appalled and on top of it my chk came out slimy and undercooked after we waited 45 mins for it!!! No way to treat a customer !!!"}
{"text":"Ok so I go to chilis at least once a week. I'm addicted to the triple dipper. I go to different ones in Charlotte. So I went walking at the park in Ballantyne after a movie. I walked/ran 4 miles and came out on the opposite side. Omg I was so tired and hungry. I would have to walk around 4 miles to get my car.   So I saw a chilis and walked over there. My phone was about to die so the bartender charged my phone for me. Such a sweet girl. I get sliders, egg rolls and boneless wings. I always ask for no bacon on my burgers and every time I get bacon on it doesn't matter where I go even when I repeat no bacon. I never understand.   This time I got it and didn't see the bacon I was like wow they got it right. I tasted bacon and spit it all up. I was so upset. I got her attention and she was visibly upset. She was so apologetic. She went to the kitchen and yelled at the cook when he told her she didn't specify that on the ticket. She said she def did. So she told the manager and they not only cooked me new burgers but they comp'd my entire meal.   How sweet. I was in shock they have never done that. Dylan was the manager and he came out to apologize and check on me. The server, I can't believe I forgot her name(Short pretty petite girl with dark hair) to the host were so nice. Hands down best chilis I been to. Thanks. I will most def be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Wow 100 reviews! Hate it had to be a negative one but it is what it is. Food was good but omg this visit was crazy. What in the world is going on a random Wednesday. No hostess. I had to get the bartender to seat me after i waited for a long time because I was being patient. And the other people were just waiting around and they said they were there awhile before us.   Finally seated we waited 15 minutes before i got someone's attention to take our order. A lady said she is just helping and got our drink order. We were ready to order but she only was able to take our drink order. So another 10 minutes goes by I'm getting very upset because it's like we are invisible. There are staff behind us in the kitchen yelling and using profanity and glasses are breaking.   Not sure what the hell is going on. I stop the manager(i think he was the manager) and he took our order after i said we been sitting here forever and we haven't even met our server. It was four of us. And we finally get our food awhile later. Not sure if they were short staffed but we were there for hours and we only had entrees and dessert.   This is suppose to be a decent place to eat quickly. Not a steakhouse. Thank God the food came out great because I would have made a scene the way things were going.   My server name was RIO Seems like a nice person but a horrible server. No refills and no one except the manager asked if we were ok. I guess he saw my facial expression. Won't be going back anytime soon.   GET IT TOGETHER PEOPLE!   Shoutout to the bartender for stepping up and helping us. She was running all over the place. She was very busy but the rest of the restaurant wasn't so occupied. Def disappointed with our experience today. We come here on a regular basis when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing. We had their delicious ribs, chicken, corn on the cob and salad. I recommend going there and getting a tasty meal at an affordable price."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad.  I have never seen a restaurant with such great looking food on the menu deliver such lousy food. Service is not genuine.   Burgers are greasy and disgusting along with the steaks. Avoid this place no wonder how good the 2 for $20 sounds.  Used to be a fan of Chili's before. What happened?"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst dinning experience I have ever had.  All of my fabulous memories from my childhood while at Chilis were washed away by this last trip there. Ok I am going to a Chilis I am not expecting world class cuisine or service but man was this a joke. It was busy but it took about 45 mins to 1 hour to get our food...our waitress felt bad so we got freee chips! Food was Chilis quality.. mediocre at best, it ain't no Applebess I'll tell yea that. Also when we got our food the chicken was under cooked and they gave it to us for free. Out early dinner turned into a late dinner. Reminder that Applebess always trumps Chilis."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened  to Chili's waited 35 minutes for cold food.   Broccoli wasnt cooked couldnt hardly cut with knife.    Wont be back for a long while."}
{"text":"I don't have anything to say about the food or the waitering - I just go for margaritas. The regular bartender is highly competent and doesn't bother me with talk if I feel like drinking in peace."}
{"text":"Always good service here. I am giving them 4 stars for service.  Employees here are friendly and customer oriented. Manager did a good job on them. Food is just averagen.  What do you expect from franchise restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice Sunday at chilis..all well prepared and nice. Deal 2 for 22 it's great  my favorite it's a sirloin steak."}
{"text":"Stopped in and tried the smokehouse combo. It was amazing! I sat at the bar. Jasmine was the server. She was very friendly and did a great job waiting on me."}
{"text":"Every time I come into chili's I sit at the bar because Janie the bartender is incrediballs!  It's her wonderful smile that lifts me up higher then eagle.  She is as sweet as a dozen sugar cubes and more refreshing then cold brewed tea on a hot summer day.  I'm from Texas and she is the most succulent Slab of meat in those dark blue jeans."}
{"text":"Rainbow chili's was not my favorite.  We came in after 9 pm for a drink after a long flight and we felt neglected.  I just wanted a drink and some of chili's awesome chips but the waitress took 15 minutes to greet us then told us the chip machine was broken down. It was 930 Wah wah wah...  Debbie downer!"}
{"text":"Service at the door SUCKS! First walk in no one is there to greet you, and when someone does walk up they still don't greet you or ask how many is in your party. Is this the Chili's way. This happened in the Henderson location as well. Our server is very nice and attentive. This is the only reason we stayed. Don't think we will return here again though."}
{"text":"Came to this Chili's a few time. Usually it fine but the past 2 time we went the service sucks. First walking in there was no one around to greet you.  We stood there for 20 mins. They claim there are so busy but they have plenty of empty tables. Took forever to get someone to take our order. After our food came out no one came back to refill our drinks or give a check. I had to wave down a different server just to get our check. This is horrible service. I live around the corner and we will never go back here again."}
{"text":"You can rarely go wrong here.  Love the chips & salsa!  Have become a big fan of Boneless Buffalo Chicken Salad!"}
{"text":"S l o w service! We waited 40 min. for our food, and when we inquired about the meal the server replied, \"What your order? Yeah, I've been checking on it, and it ain't ready.\" \"I've been all over this area but I've been checking on your order.\"  Perhaps they are under staffed."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a layover flight to Toronto, you have to seat yourself. However, my service was fast, a decently nice waitress. I ordered the old timer with cheese, had fries for my side and a syrongbow cider. Fries were a bit different, my burger was juicy, literarily speaking. Mouth watering juices flowing down like Niagara Falls, each time I bit into it. You'd almost think with so much juices it would taste like the old man up above, done laid the spatula to this patty himself, however it wasn't flavourful. I'm not sure if any spices are added to the patty when it's being made or if it's store bought pre-made frozen burgers.  However, it's my first time here so the next time I'm around I will try the steak, happy eating.  Try them out, each individual experience will be unique and don't let any reviews turn you away from any food. Experience every restaurant and dish at least once if you can.  Cheers. Have a safe flight and have fun on your adventures."}
{"text":"First of all, no complaints about the food. But the wait. The wait to sit (while you see plenty of open tables) and the wait on your food (it's Chili's so not like we ordered anything too complicated) is completely too long."}
{"text":"I have been to a bunch of Chili's and the employees at this location are the worst I have seen.  I was there for 15 minutes. Went inside twice to ask if somebody is working the outside tables. Was told somebody would be right out. Finally went back inside to try and at least get a beer while I continued my pointless wait.  1 bartender was getting drinks for the 6 customers that were packing the inside of the restaurant while the other bartender girl was cleaning (putting her fingers inside of dirty glasses to pick them up GROSS! That is how hepatitis gets spread) I stopped the who I think was the manager and asked her if someone could take my order. Her reply left me feeling like I was a huge pain in her ass. \"Well I only have the 2 bartenders working I guess I could take your order\" holy crap lady, do you not know that there are other places to eat in Vegas? I said forget it and left. Went down the street to Fatburger and was treated great. They even gave me a coupon for a free beer when I walked in"}
{"text":"First, let me start out by saying that the ambiance was just fine.  We had a fine server. I had a new entrée \"Original Chicken Crispers\" that was awful.  Each of the items on the plate had so much extra salt that it wasn't fit for human consumption.  That included the dried out chicken strips, the corn on the cob and the French Fries.    It reminded me of what used to be done in movie theatres with popcorn to get people to buy more drinks.  Except in this case, I suspect they may be encouraging more alcohol orders."}
{"text":"I come here every time I get my car serviced at Sear's Auto Center as it's right next door. Have had a great experience with the staff every time. Very friendly, very conversational and very helpful. Definitely a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"Always a great experience here.  I love the new bold flavors also!  I think the food has gotten better and better as they continued to adjust the menu.  The service was fantastic again last night.  I love the team concept of the servers and how they all help each other to provide top notch service to every table.  I had a stressful day and was with my 15 month old daughter and my 10 year old son.  I came in ready to just sit down and get off my feet, my attitude was raw and I had a pounding headache!  Then bit, bam, bedazzle!  Sharp servers getting our drinks to the table, getting our order and food out fast and it was really, really good!  My mood was changed immediately and I had a great evening.  Really was the break  I needed and these guys made it happen.  Thank you very much!  I needed that!  ;-)"}
{"text":"Prob one of my favorite places to eat. Never have had bad food or service at chili's. The menu lay out is nice and they have a lot of good items to choose from. If you sit in the bar area they have nice flat screen tv's with sports on and it's first come first serve seating. Awesome place to hang out with friends. The one by the chandler mall is also the best I've been too. 2 thumbs up and 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food was standard for the average chain restaurant. I don't think the flavors were as good as its competitors though. We arrived around 8pm on a Tuesday (5 of us) and the restaurant was fairly empty which one would expect. Unfortunately, it became frustrating because the service was SLOW. Over an hour and twenty minutes and we are still waiting on our entree's. The appetizers should have been hot when served but we were able to bite right into fried pickles without needing to let them cool, indicating they'd been sitting a bit. Same with the fries. Very disappointing. I wouldn't recommend and have no desire to return."}
{"text":"Three people asked if we were helped. None of them actually helped. I finally got my name on a text list, after losing several tables. Very frustrating. There is no indication of how you are supposed to get in queue for a table.  Really got upset when the lady said she would seat me right away, then the next one said 15 minute wait. The lady that said she would seat us right away just ignored us.   No not coming back. The food is not good enough   They have only service to offer."}
{"text":"This Chili's location has really declined. The last three times we have been here the service has been terrible. They are unable to control the thermostat so it is usually really cold. Short lady bartender is really cranky about what's on the tv's. It was Oscar night and she would only allow on TV set to Oscars. She said the rest have to be on sports although the one above us was on the shopping channel. Took a while to get a drink order in. Last trip here the food came out cold. I will be looking for a better alternative to this neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Chili's is my favorite place to east solely because I have an obsession with their chicken crispers and I'm also a fan of their fajitas! Unfortunately I made the mistake of ordering other things off of the menu. We got the fried pickles last night and the breading was falling off as you picked up the pickle. Every other restaurant in town has mastered fried pickles I don't know how a corporate restaurant hasn't. The icing on the cake was when we each consumed a deep fried garlic clove. I'm all about garlic on my food but that was more than I bargained for. The drinks at this location tend to be watered down so definitely order drinks that aren't controlled by the pour of the bartender such as beer or wine. My crispers were good per usual and the waitress was super attentive. We usually had to flag her down to get her to acknowledge us but dinner time on a Friday is busy so that's understandable (it's also a clue that maybe adding an extra waiter or waitress during busy times would be a good idea so they aren't so frazzled. poor things). I'll continue to eat at Chili's because I like their food but a little more care needs to be administered in the food/drink preparation and to the customers."}
{"text":"Why 2-Star rating? Because of the horrible service.  I came in for dinner with my 2 boys, and requested for Strip view (it wasn't busy at all, plenty of empty tables around). We were offered the patio table, which we took happily. We've been seated for about 10min with no server to greet us, but since my boys were busy drawing their kids menu and I took some pictures of the view, I didn't mind it at first. Only until there was a couple who came and seated at the table next to us who got greeted by a server immediately that I started to get irked. He told them that he'd be back, as he had some dirty dishes on his hand. When he came back, he took their drink orders, and proceeded to go back inside until I stopped him and complained that I have not even been served since I got in about 10min ago!  He was apologetic and then he went inside, and sent another server to serve us instead!  The nerve of that guy!  So when the other server asked for our drink, I asked for the manager. He proceeded to do so, but never came back to take our order.  The manager himself didn't show up until some minutes later (I think about another 5-10 minutes), in the meantime, when the 2nd server came out, I asked if ANYONE will take our order at all. He said that he was under the impression that I wanted to talk to the manager without ordering anything. OMG! He didn't even bother to check or ask, just making his own assumption!  When the manager came to our table, his explanation was that 2 servers were assigned the patio area, so that's where the confusion started, since one server thought the other already took care of our table. The manager ended up taking our orders instead.  Honestly, if it was not because my boys wanted to eat at Chili's, and that it was not past 7:30P, I would walk out and find another restaurant nearby!  The food was good, as what other Chili's standard, but service is truly lacking! When the food came, I realized that none of the server even gave us utensils and napkins that I had to ask for it. Really, are we supposed to eat our food with our fingers (I ordered steak & salad)??? And when I asked for hot sauce, it didn't come at all - not until the server came out again to see if I needed anything else that he realized that he forgot the hot sauce!  When the bill came (for those who wondered, no, I didn't get any discount from the manager on my bill), I was so tempted to omit leaving any tips, but the civilized part of me prevented that and I left the minimum 15%.  Yelpers, if you experienced such service, would you leave any tips at all to the server?"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed sitting at the bar, having a beer and some food. The food is decent, the atmosphere is nice. And typically the bartender is very pleasant. The last two times I've been in including today a young man was tending bar and was very inattentive. Asking for a glass of water seemed like an annoyance and took forever. Finally it was banged down in front of me without a word. Not even a response to me saying thank you. He doesn't belong in the customer service business.  I will be finding somewhere else to enjoy my beer and food."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday dinner and was very pleased. A friend and I sat in the lounge, it was happy hour, and the service was phenomenal! I mean seriously have you ever just had really amazing servers? Because we had three who were on top of their game, very upbeat and super friendly. They made sure we had everything we needed and they made the experience more fun! Now for the food, the fried pickles were a great ($3) buy, followed by our 2 for $22 deal, which I'm sure most Chili's fans know comes with an appetizer to split and your very own entree! We ordered the Cheese fries which were amazing, the Margarita Chicken and the Cajun Pasta. The Margarita Chicken was something I have never tried before but since it was on the healthier menu I decided to give it a go. From my first bite things were a bit bland on my plate but after some salt and salsa that the wonderful waitress brought I was immediately devouring it all. Cajun pasta is always a solid go-to if anyone is asking! Too bad I didn't have room for dessert or else I would have had to try their molten cake or cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Upon entering, the hostess asked our party of four the type of seating we preferred, we opted for a table.  We were taken to a 6 top - fine with us - perhaps no other 4 tops were available.  Immediately we could see that the the table was filthy. I saw an employee wiping a  nearby table and I quietly approached her and discreetly asked her to please clean our table.  She, very pleasantly, complied but also felt the need to tell us several times that it mustn't have been cleaned properly the evening before. We were thankful that she wiped the table for us, unfortunately it was still remained pretty nasty :(.  I am not sure what the use to wipe the tables with???  Food wise, baked potato soup was fairly bland and not very good.  The turkey avocado club was a big hit, as were the fries.  The nacho's with beef added we also pretty tasty.  The double burger was dry and not very edible.  Unfortunately when our server checked back to see if everything was okay, the club sandwich person quickly responded \"yes, great!\",  poor double burger person was unable to express her disappointment.  She had cut the burger in half and tried to soldier on but couldn't come close to finishing the half.  Thinking she, herself, was being too critical, gave the other half to the not picky, hungry member of our party.  He took one bite and confirmed that it was not her imagination - it really was awful!  When our server came back she was informed of the dissatisfaction and did take it off the check but also seemed really perturbed about it and became rather unpleasant.  Let me just say, everyone at this table expects to pay for their meal when they dine out, but we certainly expect to receive edible food.  It was a BURGER (not some new innovative culinary experiment, that was simply not to someone's personal taste) that was terrible.  The waitress didn't prepare or cook it, I presume,  so why is she taking criticism personally?  Her unpleasantness and the rather uncleanly conditions will certainly make me extremely reluctant to return."}
{"text":"Every time I go here I have terrible service the waitress didn't check on me the entire 45 minutes I was eating after she brought me the wrong food. After I approached the manager he didn't do anything to help. Every one I know that's been here refuses to go back lol"}
{"text":"There is a new item on the menu, a table side made guacamole. At first we didn't really know what it meant so we ordered it out of curiosity. The waiter came out with whole avocados in a muddling stone and mashed them there on the spot. He asked what we would like added, the list was tomatoes, jalapeños, cilantro and lemon juice. It was really delicious and a fun experience getting table side serves at such a casual setting."}
{"text":"Cold, stale, mushy corn on the cob.  Cold stale fries.  Hot chicken tenders, fried in old, bitter, sour and rancid grease.  Meals came out 60 seconds after appetizer arrived.  Servers acted like this should be no problem. \"We can put your meals under the heat lights for you.\"  \"Our kitchen is slammed.\"  How could the kitchen be slammed, since there were only a few tables being served?  Manager willing to bring different food, give coupons, or bring free desserts, but we just wanted out.  Manager comped meals, but night was ruined, and I feel sick to my stomach this morning, as I write this review.  P.S.  Ice, water and iced tea has a chemical and sewage taste.  We were told it is caused by the City of Tempe water, due to construction..Manager asked us...\"Have you called the city of Tempe to complain?\"  How about using bottled water for your customers, during the problem, instead of asking if we have called the city for you.  Part of the much larger problem of the kids in restaurant kitchens, hospitals, retail estsblishments, etc., not caring much about customer service and the quality of their work. Really needed this Chili's as an option for lunch and dinner in Tempe, but doubt I will be able to chance  coming back.  Need to go, now...not sure if I am going to throw up or have diarrhea.  Looks like my Sunday is ruin now, as well.  Thanks, Chilis."}
{"text":"Love this Chili's located right across the street from Aria Resort & Casino.  The prices are great for Vegas strip and the service was excellent.  This place is a real gem and a way to save money.  Order the Burgers!"}
{"text":"I came in last night and sat in the bar area. My server/bartender (Cory) was great, he was full of energy and had great personality, probably one of the best ones I've seen yet at Chili's. The reason I am giving a 3 star and not 1 is because of him. My husband and I did the 2 for $22, which we always do. Portions are great, he enjoyed his food but I did not. I ordered the chicken fajitas and all the veggies were raw. (And the rice could of had more flavor)  I've been to chili's a million times and the veggies were never raw) My husband asked the server for new veggies and Cory did right away. He apologized right away and said because of the new menu change, the food is made differently. But the pictures showed them cooked..... but I was happy with his quick action that I thought the rest of the meal and our time there would be enjoyable. It didn't bug us that we saw servers and cooks coming and seating in the booth in front of us. We could hear the small talk but nothing inappropriate. What made my EXPERIENCE go down was hearing and seeing the cook come out and complain about the person asking for cooked veggies and my server nervously saying \"shhh that's my table over there.\"  It made the rest of the time there awkward, hearing people talk about us. My husband liked his food and the fajitas could be better, more flavor for the rice and cooked veggies. If this is the attitude now at chili's to bad mouth costumers, I'll take my business somewhere else."}
{"text":"Chili's is usually predictable but this location is great. Good items on the Happy Hour, would love more variety. What makes this Chili's great are the servers. Go see Jamie, lots of fun."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to eat somewhere with good food that wasn't too expensive. We've had great experiences with other Chilli's locations in the past and decided to try this one since we were on this side of town. It wasn't too busy when we came in and we're immediately seated. We were seated for a minute or two before our server, Louis, came but and got our drink order. It took her less than five minutes to get our drinks to us which was great. She then took our order and told us that it would be out as soon as possible. In the time it took for our food to cook, I drained my strawberry lemonade and the hostess had a new cup to me before the ice had reached the bottom of the glass. Our food came out and my husband really enjoyed his steak. I, being eight months pregnant, had ordered the Bacon Ranch Chicken Quesadilla. I took one bite and immediately hated it. I'm usually the type of person that just deals with it but I just could not stomach this quesadilla. There generally wasn't anything wrong with it, it just didn't sit well with me. My husband noticed my hesitation and said that he would ask if we could replace it. Louis said she would bring her manager over as soon as possible. While we waited, Steph, a server for the other tables, asked if everything was okay. When told the situation, she went straight to the back and brought the manager right up. The manager quickly replaced the food without a problem and gave me a minute to look at the menu. My replacement order was brought out very quickly.  The overall experience was wonderful. The staff was friendly and patient. Will definitely be coming back here for dinner again."}
{"text":"The food was good. Server dropped off bill before we were halfway thru our meal celebrating my wife's birthday. Since when do you get the bill before you are asked about desert? She said that we were to use the table kiosk to pay our bill and we could order deserts there, too. After receiving the bill server never came back to see if we needed an additional napkin or to have our drinks refilled. If you are too busy to give service to your customers you will not have customers. It is not like we were dining at McDonals's or Burger King. With all of the choices out there I would recommend any place else."}
{"text":"Good sevice and food. Manager ron is nice. I will be back. Fast and friendly staff. Ok this is a short post but its worth it."}
{"text":"TLDR: better service now; Ziosk payment system; lunch specials available; lounge area busy  This is my first time at this location, but I wanted to provide my input because of the other poor-rated reviews I read on here.   Upon entering, I was greeted based by the host who seems like he's having as much fun as one can have at a funeral. Needless to say, he seemed attentive. I was going to sit at the bar/lounge at first because of my lonely party of one, but the singular bartender/waiter/server indicated that I would have a 5-10 minute wait prior to greeting me. He seemed unusually busy, which cautions me away from sitting there. I recommend more staffing.   I decided to sit in the restaurant instead. I was greeted by a very tired waitress who joined me at the table to sit and take my order. I usually don't mind this, but a preface to sitting would make a connection, but maintain professionalism. I was impressed when 2 waitresses wanted to serve me. A mix up with the tables, but still wanting to serve me instead of give me away made me feel appreciated as a customer.   I ordered the bottomless express lunch for $6.99 which includes chips and salsa, a house salad, and one of four soups. I chose the southwest chicken soup which is more like a chicken tortilla soup. Food was delivered fast as it's probably prepared by the server, hopefully without bare hand contact, a huge pet peeve.   My soup was hot and topped with tortilla strips and fresh cut cilantro. The soup contained fair amounts of chicken and chickpeas and was flavorful with just the right amount of spice. I recommend asking for a side of sour cream!  The house salad is pretty standard with upgrades such as cut tomatoes, sliced cucumbers, onions, frisée. This pairs nicely with their ranch. The bottomless express lunch is $8.99 after 4pm, so consider that before ordering.   My server was attentive and ensured I got refills of solid food and drink when necessary. I utilized the Ziosk machine to check out with ease, provided a tip, and took a survey. Don't fool around with the machine though; you will get charged for the games.   All-in-all a good deal :)"}
{"text":"This place is a f****** disgrace.  Ordered shrimp tacos & the shrimp was RAW! Place was dirty, service was terrible, & my raw shrimp tacos took almost an hour to get to my table.  You couldn't get me back in that place at gunpoint."}
{"text":"The fajitas were oily and soggy.. Way too many onions and not enough meat. I could only get 2 burritos out of it (I got the $15 trio fajita) and I usually get 3-4 out of the fajita skillet. The chicken tasted fake, it was slimy and had a weird texture. The steak was ok and they have a convenient ordering system at the table. The waitress in the bar area took soo long I was there over an hour. She never came to get change for the check and she was talking amongst other servers not paying attention. She took checking on us too. The watermelon lemonade was not refreshing, it taste like fountain lemonade and syrup. However, the chips and salsa were great! I usually like chills, but this location doesn't seem up to par."}
{"text":"Another Chili's, I'm rating it 4 because it was very clean, great service, and the servers are attractive. nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Server not intuitive but friendly and courteous.   Table side guacamole was blah, no flavor.   My son did not like the chicjen tenders on the kids menu.  I think the batter was the same as you would use on fush sticjs.  We added more jalapeno and it didn't help.  My salmon was dry snd overly lemon flavored.   Watermelon Cooler was good."}
{"text":"An ordinary chain restaurant. Adequate, but since our tastes do not run to southwestern style meals, we only go on occasion."}
{"text":"Stay away. Drive another mile down the road and you will have a lot of other options which not being from Charlotte we did not know. Food and service were awful."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since my family visited Chili's in North Olmsted,  It will be a long time until I go back.  We had friends from out of town who wanted to go there. Problems showed up with the server at the appetizer round.  We wanted some chips and salsa.  What we got was salsa and a few chips.  We had to ask for more chips.  Dinner ordered, I figured they could not mess up a hamburger and fries and a house salad.  Wrong again.  We munched on our second helping of chips and did not see our server again until dinner was served.  Of course my salad was nowhere to be seen.  I told the server to just cancel it.   The burger was a burger,  There was nothing special about it.  If you want a burger, try The Rail or Red Robin or Moosehead Bar and Grill in Olmsted Falls."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. If you have to wait for a booth, just walk into the bar area and seat yourself! With the rewards program Chili's offers, we find we get a free dessert or appetizer every third visit. Service has always been excellent here, but they can get busy during rush hour, so head in there early!"}
{"text":"I'm really disapponted in this place. I went to chili's to spend time with my family after a long work week. When we got there we was not greeted and the hostess made us seat ourselves as if she had other things to do. Our server was somewhat busy which was ok it have us time to look at the menu to figure out what we wanted to order when she did come. 20 minutes passed and she finally got to us, then we waited 30 more minutes for our food. I wouldn't of mind waiting that long if the restaurant was busy but it was not for a Friday night. I ordered an alcoholic drink which was disgusting. My kids liked their food I don't know if it was because I was hungry. I ordered fajitas which was good minus the steak being chewy (I should've ordered it medium). So my kids finished their food before I did so I I know dessert on the tablet. During this whole time our server never checked on us. By the time I was done eating our dessert still wasn't there so I waited another 20 minutes by this time my kids  are becoming restless and wanting their dessert.  My daughter saw someone bringing dessert but unfortunately it was for another table. Our server then comes with the check asking  if we wanted dessert and by this time I was frustrated. I told her to just take the dessert off my check. I paid and did the survey in the end. I knew I should've just went to BJ'S but I wanted to go somewhere closer to my house. I doubt I will return to this location again."}
{"text":"First time I ate at this one, got a great server.  She was very friendly, spot on with taking our oder and getting our drinks/food out.  I had the Steak Fajitas, they were good, still sizzling when they came out.  Was very happy with the experience.  Second time, was December 2009, was sat at a table that had a hurricane blowing down on us from the A/C vent.  Waited 10 minutes before anyone showed up for me to even ask to have it turned down, then another 5 minutes for our drink order.  I ordered the Ribeye Steak, my 4yo son got mac & cheese, my girlfriend got a buffalo chicken sandwich.    40 minutes goes by (and the place wasnt even busy), drinks completely empty, our food comes out.   My fries are soggy like wet shoelaces, my steak that was supposed to be Medium was cooked all the way through and cold by the time it made it to the table.  I'm guessing it sat under the heat lamp the entire time.  I hate sending food back because.. well i've seen the movie Waiting and it terrifies me.  But for a $20 plate thats so gross i cant even eat it, i have to do it.  15 more minutes goes by, my replacement comes out and its cooked more to order but tastes like a $3 manger special skirt steak cooked with a cigarette lighter.  After one bite, i left it.  Total bill was around $50 for 2 adults and 1 kid.    I'm never going to this Chilis again."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! My fiancé and I had absolute outstanding service by our waiter Mark! We had a minor issue with our garlic bread being a little hard so we addressed Mark about it with a pleasant attitude and brought us back 2 garlic breads when the meal originally came with 1... We'd definitely recommend this to anyone! Not only did he check on us but every waiter that passed did as well!! - two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"I always loved Chilis but my wife isn't to fond of them.  She suggested we go last night because we had a gift card and was hoping to change her mind about the place since I enjoyed it.  We will never ever go back to this location and may never go back at all.  Service was terrible.  Waitress had an attitude from moment we sat down.  She Took our order, made the horrendous table side guacamole and that was last we saw of her until we were ready to pay and leave. We had to flag down others for silverware, find napkins, never got a refill on  drinks as waitstaff didn't pass by our table in general.  My ribs were dry, my wife's crispy chicken thing was terrible, corn on cob texture was chewy and so much salt to hide the flavor it was non eatable.    Never go here.  Chilis should be embarrassed by this location and shut it down immediately, afterwards we went to a movie and then came home.  I ended up getting physically ill in middle of night so I suspect food was contaminated even.  Avoid this Chilis .  I only give 1 star because not possible to give 0."}
{"text":"I don't know I expected, but maybe I was hoping for more. I was with a buddy visiting from out of town, and he wanted to go here. I didn't want to be a pain so I went with the flow.   The staff was friendly enough, but the food was mediocre at best. My chicken seemed like it was warmed up in a microwave.  The flavor was not terrible  and the staff was nice so 3 stars seems about right. It's not the worst, but I am struggling to find things that were positive. For the money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food used to be better. We ordered the salmon and the ribeye. Both were overcooked. Very blah. The quality of the steak was not good either. Maybe in the freezer too long? Not sure, tender, but funky."}
{"text":"First time at a chili's in general.  Not bad considering it's in the airport.  Food was good, the chicken crispers nice and hot.  (wow good spice)  Server was very attentive.  Prices are what you would expect but nice to sit and enjoy a beverage before getting on flight.  Restrooms were FAR away.  Not Chili's fault, just warning you."}
{"text":"I ordered a kids grilled cheese at chili's today and it was the best grilled cheese I have ever had in my life. simply impressive. however, the chicken strips were bad according to my friend. I cannot be sure about this though because I am a vegetarian. Great job chili's!"}
{"text":"This trip only three stars for lack of service. Hardly saw our server. Had more of an interaction with the device on the table. Usually get more check-up's from the servers here. Disappointed by this as last time it was so awesome, perhaps because we sat in the lounge. Work on the service and you'll get better reviews and tips. Food was pretty good though. Not the best I've had here, but not the worst Chili's."}
{"text":"Service is usually pretty good. The food is good and you can't beat the 2 for 20. It's close to home and also nice fir a quick lunch date with the wife while grandma is babysitting the baby. It's quick easy and fun so we like it."}
{"text":"Oh darren's a dootiehead. I like Chili's."}
{"text":"Had a great experience on Saturday. Our server was very attentive and constantly checking in to make sure that our service and food were good. Everything was handled in a timely fashion (seating, drinks, food) and our server was very friendly. We will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I would usually go into an in depth Yelp, but this Chili's isn't worth my time.  I had the classic sirloin, ordered medium-rare. I had normal expectations, but come to find out, reality hurts. It was cooked rare, overdosed on NaCl/sodium chloride/salt, and nothing better than mediocre.   My nephew even had the same entree, but he had a really flagrant tasting sirloin. Did I mention, there was silver skin, tough meat and overpriced meals?   Very disappointed. I'll shed a tear to all my Chili's fans who have been led astray. Let's all make a change and find a competitor! Or let's create a new restaurant, I suggest we call it Yelp!ed. Viva la revolution! (Excuse my lack of an awesome finishing line to my Yelp.)"}
{"text":"We went here this afternoon wanting to give chili's a second chance. We previously had bad service and should have known better to go back. The host person just asked if we wanted to take a seat at the back table in the bar and didn't even walk us over.also didn't give us a kids menu for our son. Than we sat for ten minutes while people cleaned up other tables and never acknowledge us. I don't understand why this place is always so dirty. There's always napkins on the floor. Everyone acts busy even though there's barely anyone there. We left and went to Applebees across the street where people actually greet you and want your service."}
{"text":"What you would expect. I got a burger and it was nice and juicy but sans lettuce and tomato like the one shown in the picture. The baked potato soup was incredible. The tortilla chips were thin and crispy, just how I like them. Service was quick and and friendly, and we had zero wait to be seated on a weekday."}
{"text":"Convenient place for Tex-Mex food. Overall experience was fine ... Decent food, service was okay and good choice on the menu."}
{"text":"Decided to have something else other than fast food while waiting for our flight back home. So that's what brought us to Chili's. Just like any other Chili's I've been to, their food is swimming in SALT. Please please HOLD THE SALT to all the chefs in Chili's kitchen. It doesn't make your food any good with all that salt.   Anyways, you would think the service here should be decent or fast so you won't miss your flight if you'e eating while waiting for your flight like I was. The service is slower than a freakin turtle. We got seated after a 15 minute wait for a table. After being seated, we waited for half an hour before a waiter came out to finally ask us what we wanted to drink. She quickly walked away after putting our drinks order in and we didn't get a chance to order our food. I was so frustrated. Took about another 5-10 minutes for the drinks to come out and then she took our order. Probably waited 45 minutes until our food came out. The longest wait I've ever experienced at Chili's. By the time our food came out, we had to rush and eat it because it was almost time for our flight. I don't think I got the chance to finish my food anyways. The food wasn't even HOT when it was brought out. Worse Chili's experience ever.  TO all the future customers, bring a book or something to keep you occupied. I am sure you'll be doing a lot of waiting at this Chili's."}
{"text":"I'm going to list some key points of why I'm giving this restaurant a one-star. First when we got there the hostess didn't even walk us to our booth second our waiter didn't come to greet us after 30 minutes, she finally got our drink orders she went away and give us some \"more\" time to select some items from the menu. When she came back she had some sort of attitude towards us when she was talking our order .when she went back to place our dinner it took about 22 minutes and 27 seconds for our meal to come out and yes I did time it on my phone because it took forever for us to even have someone recognizes and get our food in the process. when we were paying our bill we decided to get dessert to go we waited about another 15 minutes for them to even realize that we were still waiting for our last order to come by. It was more that we had to flag her down. She  asked us who we place the order with and as she went to the kitchen and waited 5 mins. she didn't even come out to give us the dessert she asked another waitress to do it. Don't go here I wish I had the name of the waitress however she never gave us her name"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Chilis for years and have no idea what this location does that makes the food so terrible! I had a chicken avacado sandwich that I took one bite out of and spit it out. It had a weird burnt smell but wasnt burnt? My date had the ribs and chicken strips. Same issue for him, took one bite and spit it.. It almost had a gasoline type of odor that neither one of us had smelt before on food. I attempted to take the food home and funny story my dog wouldnt even go near it... He walked up to it, smelt it and walked away (my dog will eat a cardboard box if I put it in his bowl) Only good thing here was the $5 presidente margarita they offer on football Sundays."}
{"text":"Stopped by this past Saturday around 8pm. Parking lot seemed full but inside didn't seem that busy at all. We were seated at our table and had to wait 10+ minutes for anyone to take our drink order. Took another 15 minutes for the drinks to be delivered (water, pepsi, and ritatrio - the nonalcoholic beverages could have been served sooner but I guess our waitress didn't want to do her job). Appetizer finally arrived after we've been there for 45 minutes (didn't realize a half order of cheese fries took that long - no explanation given) and another 15+ minutes for our entrees. Meanwhile at surrounding tables, other patrons were being waited on, with the manager, I think his name was Tom, also assisting - our empty table was never acknowledged as he walked by several times. Despite the food being OK, the service was terrible. Casual dining should NEVER be 2 hours long..."}
{"text":"We got there and we had to wait due that it was packed, but it wasnt a long wait until we got our seats...  Waitresses are kind and helpful...  Overall, it was a pleasant experience, i would go back..."}
{"text":"Good food. Have been here numerous times and hardly have a bad experience. If there are any issues with your food they will do whatever they can to fix it."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here a lot because of a few choice menu items that we both crave (that + the fact that it's so close to us).  PROS: Friendly wait staff (except that one time... literally, one time this waitress we had was a total B*%$# for no good reason because we are very friendly and tip well!); The food is consistent--you'll get it exactly how its supposed to be gotten!   :) Interesting frozen cocktails and such (for adult consumption)  CONS: it's very much like a TGI Fridays (and, yes, that is a con)  My FAVES: Honey-Chipotle Chicken Crispers (So sweet,yet so spicy-NomNomNom) Southwestern Eggrolls (w/Regular ranch-not a fan of the wasabi-Ranch)"}
{"text":"It was an awful experience that cost me a ton of money. My orders were wrong. It took a long time. I was charged for food I didn't eat. I will not be back."}
{"text":"It only took a few times of going to this location before they knew our names and what we want.  We don't even have to order anymore they already know what we want.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was in the area today and had lunch with a colleague here.  I ordered the 12 Piece Chicken Nachos.  They were very good.  I thought the proportion of all of the toppings on each chip was perfect.  The portion was good, I wasn't too full and not left hungry.  The Salsa was too weak for my tastes and the Jalapenos weren't spicy at all.  If I could change two things it would be to offer a spicier Salsa option and offer a spicier Jalapeno option.  Will I return?  Sure."}
{"text":"We go here often since it's in our neighborhood. Always friendly, great for kids, good kids menu options. Quality is consistent. Burgers are amazing. Good non-alcoholic drink options.   Sometimes the service is slow... a hit or miss. It doesn't seem to matter what time of day it is. Afternoon, dinner, late night, weekday or weekend, I've had slow service several times, so don't go here for just a quick bite.   They could do a better job at picking up straw wrappers and food that has fallen on the floor. It can get quite messy. On the upside, the bathrooms are always clean, stocked, and there's hot water, which is more than I can day for other restaurants in the vicinity.  Bottom line... go here for good food and relaxed atmosphere. Pros outweigh the cons."}
{"text":"Wife and I strolled over here last minute to take part in their happy hour. It's til 7, so we didn't need to rush like we did getting here at 530.  Came for the appetizers but I enjoyed a tall $5 cold beer and her a water.  We were greeted & seated right away by their friendly staff. Service was tops and our food was very good. Loved there boneless wings and sauces.  All told the bottomless chips and salsa, tasty southwest egg rolls and the yummy wings with my beer was a very reasonable $22."}
{"text":"I have only come here to sit at the bar and watch hockey games. There's been the same bartender, Johnny, and he is all about the customer. We have always been treated attentively, he is on top of keeping the drinks refreshed, food served hot and makes sure everything is above satisfactory. I saw this place had some bad reviews, I can't vouch for anywhere but the bar service, but you will not be disappointed if you choose to sit at the bar. There was another couple sitting close by who made several good comments about the bartender as well. Great attitude, great service and he will make sure you're accommodated. I was watching a game to the side of us, and he changed the channel so I didn't have to watch with my head turned.  Didn't even ask, he just did it. So yep, Johnny is a great bartender/server here. Hope he never quits, my boyfriend and I come back because of the service. The food is good too!"}
{"text":"Seating wait time: 15mins (Sunday afternoon)  Food time after ordering: 5mins for appetizers 35-40 min for entrees.   Food quality: 5 out of 5  Waiter: 5 out of 5    Me and my girlfriend walked in on a Sunday afternoon before our long trip home to California. It was our first time there so we had no idea what to expect. It was a bit busy and they do not have much room for waiting. The wait time to be seated was relatively short for the amount of people there. We were able to get our drinks and appetizers really quick after ordering. The problem was the entrees taking too long. The food was really great for a chain restaurant with the enchiladas being the best I've had in a long time. The waiter was great and was keeping us up to date about our food. Overall great restaurant with good food but get four stars due to long food wait times and poor waiting area."}
{"text":"There's 2 things my boyfriend and I love on their menu: chips & queso and steak nachos. We come in 1-2 times a month, sit at the bar, tip well and usually leave fat and happy. Tonight however, I'm leaving with a horrible taste in my mouth thanks to management. Here's how it went down:  \"We'd like the steak nachos\" \"We're out of steak, we only have ground beef\"  \"Can you sub out the steak you use for the fajitas?\" \"Uhh probably not.\" \"Why not? We want steak nachos, you have steak and nachos, I don't understand\"  \"Hold on let me ask management\" \"Management, no because we're almost out of steak\"  So instead of maybe having to 86 steak fajitas later in the evening, they said no to two regular customers, just in case. Bad idea.   Rule #1 of hospitality, always do everything you can to accommodate the guest.   Rule #2 keep regulars happy.   We will not be returning."}
{"text":"We have been ordering steak fajitas from Chili's for years! Never again!! I guarantee I will  never eat another bite of anything from a Chili's restaurant!!I had read about restaurants serving what is called Frankenstein steak. We got cubes of meat to rather than strips for our fajitas. The smell was awful!! One bite and it went straight in the garbage!!! I called the store manager and I did raise my voice and told her I was feeding the meat to my dog. I decided that it was not even fit for my dog to eat and tossed it in the garbage!! By the way the manager hung up on me. I called their corporate offices and advised them that the only description for what they are serving is sh**!!! She then said she was going to hang up on me!! I advised her our conversation was over and she says they serve nothing but quality food!! My last sentence to her was that I have already used the only word I know of to describe what Chili's is serving!!"}
{"text":"We decide to get some takeout the presentation of the food was horrible. I did like the ease of ordering online but I did not care for the presentation. My Big Mouth bites were saturated with the sauce from the Chipotle chicken crisps. My Southwestern egg rolls  were covered in chipotle sauce. It was a sticky mess"}
{"text":"Chilies is always my go to place to eat. I always have the best service and the food is amazing! I always get eaither the 2 for 20 something deal with the cajun chicken pasta...so bomb...I also really like the steak too. Get the rewards....helps a lot!"}
{"text":"Food poisoning. Didn't make it home before getting sick. 24 hours of chills, fever, headache, body aches:( Couldn't finish the Steak as it had a sponge consistency. What kind of fake meat is that? Never again. Food quality has gone down hill. Not impressed with being made deliberately sick by fake meat!"}
{"text":"We always love coming before they got the table tables for easy ordering and pay, the series is just not the same!  The staff put the food down and never come back"}
{"text":"Chilis has really stepped up their service and quality of food. Our experience today was awesome. We are regulars so the change is service is noticeable. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and Lyssa was our bartender. She was very nice and helpful, and gave us great service. She took our drink order and ask us if we wanted to put our appetizer order in. She was able to explain our our options and offer helpful suggestion to make our order better. We had margaritas with sugar and salt rim and it was wonderful. My husband got the Cajun chicken pasta  and she ordered a creamy jalapeño sauce that made his dish the best he has ever had."}
{"text":"I eat at this Chili's somewhat frequently. The food and service are usually good. I went with a friend yesterday, and while the service was still excellent, the food was not. We started with their new pretzel stick appetizer. They might have just been overcooked, but because of their texture, it is more likely they had been frozen then heated in the microwave. I had the baby back ribs with broccoli, and again, because of the texture, both seemed like they had been frozen then heated in the microwave.  Because I've had good experiences in the past, I hope I'm wrong, and hence the 3 stars for the benefit of the doubt. I don't want Chili's to be a place that buys frozen food then just heats it in the microwave. I can do that at home for less money."}
{"text":"No one goes to a chain restaurants and expects awesome service. But today our service was beyond horrible. No drink refills unless we asked, 30 minutes to get an appetizer that we ordered twice. And hair in our food when the place was nearlt empty and had tons of servers dping nothing. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Had chicken crisper with honey mustard and m in love with this dish. A must visit for all Valley people"}
{"text":"I've been to this location before but that has been years ago. I have tended to avoid this particular location as it always looks busy, the parking lot jammed full of cars.  We stopped by for lunch this past Friday to see if there was a wait. I'd say the restaurant was a little less than half full and I was a bit surprised. I chalk it up to the number of fast casual dining options out there now.  We ordered off the lunch special menu. For $7 per person you can get a small appetizer and a main course. We each had a salad - even though the bowls were small, the portions were just enough. My wife had the chicken tacos with a side of black beans, which she proclaimed to be good. I had a double burger with fries. The patties were well done - they were thin to begin with, so I guess they don't bother to ask you the temperature. My fries were barely warm. Everything tasted okay but the experience was lackluster. On the plus side we had a good waiter and I bet if I had said something about my burger and fries he probably would have had them re-fire them.  C'est la vie!"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week. The service is always great at the bar and they have the best happy hour in this area. Awesome lunch specials too! I always get the chicken enchilada soup and the California chicken Flatbread. For $8 you can't beat it and $5 margaritas. Norm is usually the bartender when I am there but they are all great!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my bestie. The food was very good. Service was excellent. Rudy was our server and he took very good care of us."}
{"text":"Big chilis fan but was surprised by the lack of service from the staff. Seemed like every request was an inconvenience by multiple servers. Not the type of environment and service that I've come to rely in from a great restaurant chain. Hopefully it's better next time."}
{"text":"Very disappointed on my dinner tonight. I come to Chili's often, but this visit got me upset...First of all it wasn't busy... Finally after ordering order came to the table and my steak wasn't Cooked right..sent it back...and came back out burnt...very disappointed....please take the time to make sure you satisfy your customers."}
{"text":"This Chili's is a great neighborhood restaurant.  I love how this Chili's is always clean and the staff is always super friendly.  Chili's is always a great supporter of the local schools so they always give out free kids meals with purchase of adult meal or some kind of special to bring us in....and we do!  They have a great deals on lunch and happy hour specials.      My husband review would be 2 stars based on poor beer selection on tap and the last time he ordered nachos......he wouldn't call them nachos, he was disappointed. He does love the hamburgers as they are consistently good.  He also likes their lettuce wraps.   Thus, our 3 rating......Mom and kid give it 4 stars and dad.....2 stars."}
{"text":"Chili's is Chili's. It's mass marketed bar/grill food, so I'm sure you know what to expect when you go.   But this location actually impressed me quite a bit from the last time I went some few years ago. The service was actually very, very good. The gal was training a new employee with us and considering even that I was still thoroughly pleased.  Chili's is a chain. Standard Bar/grill faire. But of all the places we could have gone instead, this was actually a very positive experience."}
{"text":"We regularly visit this location since it's only few miles away from my house. Me and my friends have tradition to go out to eat every Saturday and we get together if we are don't have anything else planned out.   They have great host who welcomes you with big smile which is BIG plus in my reviews. Service would be dependent upon who you get as your server. They have great drink specials and usually they have margaritas for only $3. I usually get their black bean burger with corn on the cob and blue cheese on the side. To close it off, I love their Molten Chocolate Cake YUM!"}
{"text":"I totally agree with Chad here. I was here once when we were just walking in Concord Mills and decided to just walk in here for dinner since it was very cold outside. We were seat within few minutes so it wasn't as bad as other Chili's I been to so far.   Once we were seated, it took few minutes for the server to come ask us if we needed any drinks and surprising thing was they weren't busy at all. We saw her flirting with the bartender for long time before she came to our table. I was like oh well, may be she is got a thing for him. We order our drinks and again it took her long time just to get couple of soft drinks.   We decided to give her our food order right when she came back with the drinks that way we don't have to wait long to order. We ordered mushroom swiss burger with black bean patty and I told her twice that we are vegetarian so please make sure that it's black bean patty.   So she came back with our food and I asked her, is it black bean patty? and she said YES so we dived in since we were really hungry. We took our first bite and it tasted strange so I called the manager to ask him, is this really black bean patty? so he looked at it and said yep. I took another bite and it really didn't tasted like what it normally taste like so I called them again and come to find out, it was MEAT.   OHH I was so MAD.. I just wanted to sue them for it just like how that Indian guy sued McD few years back but than again I was like it's not going to UNDO what just happened.   The manager said I wouldn't change you for your meal and I said I really feel like throwing that MEAT burger on your face. Than we just walked off. We didn't ate anything that night :("}
{"text":"I came here with a friend of mine for dinner and I would say we enjoyed our time here. Finding a parking was the toughest of all as one of the yelper noted here.   We arrived and checked in, come to find out we only had to wait for ten mins. Within several minutes our gadget buzzed and we got a table.   Our server arrived with in a min to see if we wanted to get a drink so I ordered their margarita and It came out perfect. After few mins he came back to check on us to see if we were ready to order and we ordered our entree. It took them little time to get out entree out but that was perfect timing to chitchat and flirt.    Food came out great the first time and we didn't had to ask for anything extra other than napkins. We were so full, we skipped on desert and requested our check.   We really enjoyed our time here on a Friday night and I would recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Our waitress was fine-- but the others wouldn't stop gossiping. The food was horrendous and please do yourself a favor and avoid ordering the vinegar loaded buffalo wings."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in for dessert, just after 10pm. We stood at the hostess station for over 5 minutes. No one greeted us or acknowledged our presence in any way. So, we went across the street to Friday's."}
{"text":"Can't be happier with their service. I went with my family a week ago, and one of my kids forgot his orthodontics retainers on the table. We didn't realized until we get home at night. And we live in California. Next day I called the restaurant to ask and an employee told me that they do have the retainers, so I ask to call to the manager, her name is Miah, she was so nice, and offered to send them by mail. Next day she called to let me know she sent the package and give me the tracking number. We already got them. Who does that for you now days?? I'm so grateful with her, and the nice guy who served us at the table because he kept them knowing that we'll get back tomoick them up. Thank u again"}
{"text":"Horrible service, food was okay. Will not be returning anytime soon"}
{"text":"The good thing about Chili's and any big chain, is that you k is what to expect. They aren't always the best in town but they are consistent and usually have decent cleanliness processes so you are safe to eat there. This place is no exception and is probably one if the better Chilis in the area. My only gripe here is that when they start getting busy, not slammed but let's call it a \"15 minute wait\" type busy, the ticket times suffer. We got in just before they started having a wait and it took almost an hour to get our food. The waiter was nice, kept us with chips/salsa and drinks filled. Not mad it's one of those times where you are just about to the point of getting aggravated then the fold shows up. If they are even remotely busy here the food times are slow, other than that they are great."}
{"text":"Pretty much what I expected from a chain restaurant.  Came here with my inlaws.  The potato soup was good.  The sliders were pretty good.  The service was good.  Nothing really special, but quite satisfactory."}
{"text":"This is a great, clean Chilis. I LOVE the carnitas tacos. Fairly quiet atmosphere with lots of room, but still feels warm. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for this style restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in here last night for someplace different than our usual places. I tried the new craft burger and she had a mexican salad of some kind. She really liked the salad and the Smoke House burger was pretty good a bit on the overcooked and dry side. They never asked how I wanted the burger cooked so I thought I would see what they would do. The fries were good and portioned perfect, thanks for not dumping a plateful as I probably would eat em all.."}
{"text":"Horrible! Doesn't ever deserve one star. I picked up a sante fe wrap in between flights, and unfortunately didn't start eating it until after takeoff. It was soggy, fell apart, and what I did manage to eat made me miserable for hours. Definitely will be finding another place to eat on LAS layovers."}
{"text":"Service was sporadic.   Food was good but the server completely messed up our bill.  Our friends were charged twice but then both were removed.  So we were charged for both meals.  She had no clue how to do separate checks"}
{"text":"Great experience thank you Angel our waiter that assisted us so graciously. He was attentive, humble and overall tipped the scales to an excellent experience. Appreciate his patience and spirit of service."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant if you like to wait 2 hours for your food and at least 1 hour for a bowl of queso and eating chips for that hour. My food was subpar at best. The chicken was chewy and dry the corn was as mushy as an old couch left on the side of a road. Hey at least the  fries were hot! All in all don't come here if you have no patience."}
{"text":"Went to Chili's for the first time in a long time. Was ok. Nothing special. Food average. Service average. They got 4 stars because of the balloon guy. He was awesome. Made a TMNT and Luke Skywalker for my boys. Never saw anyone make anything but cheesy animals before."}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Had dinner with my bro, we sat at the bar and had the best service, some delicious fajitas and an excellent bartender. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Walked in with my family. Nobody up front to greet us. We waited up front for someone to acknowledge us for about 3-4 mins. After coming in speaking distance with at least 3-4 employees and not a much as an acknowledgment, \"welcome\" or \"hey, we'll be right with you\", we ended up turning around and walking out. On our way to find another restaurant that values customer service now. No line, not busy, and apparently they don't want to be. Disappointed. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Normally a review for Chili's would not be something I'd feel compelled to write, but we wrote off this place a few months ago due to horrible service and food that tasted frozen and microwaved.  We wound up here yesterday to use to a gift card and the need for something easy.  First thing we noticed was that the tired decor had received a face lift.   Second is that the staff seemed a lot less hostile and were quick to greet and seat us.  Third was that the menu had received an overhaul, which was a nice surprise.  I tried the new slow roasted chicken sandwich (shredded chicken) with homestyle fries.   Both the sandwich and fries were fresh, hot and delicious.  With my meal came a survey to rate the sandwich, which I thought was a great idea to find if people liked their new menu choices.    They also added table tablets where you can play games, order drinks, see the menu, and pay at your table.  I love being able to keep my credit card in sight!  What was really handy is that it let's you split the check multiple ways with multiple payers.   Our food was a 5, but the one thing keeping me from giving a 5 star review is that our sodas sat empty for over 5 minutes until we stopped a manager who was walking by.  The place was packed and I think our server may have had too many tables.  We only saw him to take our order and hand us the bill."}
{"text":"Their service has gotten better the food is also got better their management seems to now be in control. But if you want to have a good time go see Gary at the bar he will make you laugh serve you a hell of a drink and make sure your food is the best that he can do"}
{"text":"I work right by this chili's and I'm a good customer but this spinach queso was ridiculous.. Idk if they just heated up some cheese and threw some uncooked spinach in it but this was awful!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch just had the triple dipper, southwestern egg rolls very delicious along with the chicken crisper. The service was good for being busy on Father's Day. I would recommend for a quick American style lunch. $44"}
{"text":"Easy car side for nights I do not want to cook. Great potato soup. Service is always good."}
{"text":"Great service from Jeffrey today Horrible food. The quesadilla salad with grilled chicken- description sounded wonderful I recall drizzled Salad dressing - salad was wilted and the dressing turned it into a lake - chicken had hot and cold spots   The jalapeño bacon frys came out looking like they'd been sitting on a shelf   Beer tap I wanted was broken so no IPA   See pictures   1.5 hours later I was sitting in the toilet with major diarrhea"}
{"text":"2 stars only because management handled the issue extremely well. 94.5 sanitation grade almost has us walk out but decided to give it a chance. Based on the food alone, I wouldn't have even given it one star. But since the waitress and manager were apologetic and wanted to correct the issue I gave 2.  *see pics of burgers"}
{"text":"Three stars because the food was actually good, but the lack of service is where they fall short. My family & I get seated pretty quick, lots of open tables so we assume we'd get drinks taken soon. After about 5 min no one has yet to come by. A family is seated to the right of us & the server shows up with a min. Another 5 min & the family to the left of us is getting served. After 15 min my husband (who was a server years ago) politely goes to the host & lets him know. He walks over to the 2 servers working the area & the 3 of them stare at us chatting as somehow we've inconvenienced them for being sat at that table. After they figure who should be serving us because clearly we were dumped in the over flow a guy comes over - no apologies for the wait & ask for our drink order. If servers are annoyed because of too many tables then take that to management, don't fault the customer for your lack of staff."}
{"text":"Just ate here for lunch. Now my boyfriend and I are both very sick. My butt hole hurts very very bad. My waitress hated me. she gave me brown avocado. My boyfriend pooped a whole leaf. I just. I just. I gotta go."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm a big chili's lover in NY. This chili's location is disgusting. I came for a late dinner maybe about 9 o'clock 3 other tables having dinner the wait was 15 mins to be greeted by a host. Waitress was pleasant took the orders correctly food was terrible my husband I both ordered honey chipotle chicken crispers mashed potatoes and corn. The chicken tasted like it was laying under a heating lamp for hours  waited to order desert and ask the waitress a question but she disappeared over 20 minutes so sadly no desert for me. I will just stick to my usual chili's spots and not on vacations"}
{"text":"Our experience was awesome! We enjoyed our food, and our server was very nice. We were seated right away, and waited on shortly after that. I guess it has been a while since we ate here last, because the menu was different. Many different choices were available in different categories of the menu. I chose the fajitas, and loved the fact that I could choose up to three different types of meats. Then my son ordered the cheeseburger sliders, and my husband ordered chicken and waffles. The presentation of the food was excellent, and portions sizes were very friendly. I was pleased with my meal, and service. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our experiences at this location have been consistently better than the review from last month. Lucky, I guess!   We have a family of five, and rarely have to wait more than a few minutes to be seated - lunch or dinner. Lately, of course, this is not a suprise - this one doesn't do the business that it used to, since the economy went down. Anyway, the hostess is always nice; the server is never the same, but always very courteous and friendly; and even more important to my kids, our food is ready pretty quickly. I don't think I have ever had to wonder what the deal was, while at this one. Other locations, oh yeah.   Three stars because the service is always good and the food is decent for a chain. But it is still a chain restaurant, and we never expect anything more than what a chain restaurant can offer."}
{"text":"Terrible!!  The server was rude! I had to ask for plates for our appetizers and believe it or not our plates were hotter than the food. The wings had most likely been sitting back here on the warmer for awhile. The cheese on them was not even melted. It was 2:00pm on a Thursday afternoon; it's not like they were slammed with customers. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"One of the waiters took a sip from a drink at the bar and then served it to a customer. How disgusting! It was a sloppy, unkept, greaseball looking guy with a dirty looking wannabe beard. Dude shouldn't be working in a restaurant. Will NOT be eating in Chili's again!"}
{"text":"Short and simple. My partner and I decided to have lunch here. As we entered, it was not even close to being busy. The hostess told us that they'll be right there to help us get seated as she wandered towards the back. 10 mins has passed and we're still waiting with no help in sight, got out and took our business else where."}
{"text":"The only Chilis I'll go back to. We always seem to get the same waiter (still can't remember his name) but he always remembers us as well. He's definitely a hard worker, knows how to get good tips. The food is always on point. Staff knows how to make a mean raspberry sweet tea & best thing.... we're always greeted with a smile & when we leave we're always told to have a great day."}
{"text":"Very unhappy staff & it showed from start to finish! The entire time the girl that seats you was on her cell phone. Never smiled once & the greeting was table or booth. When I said booth, she acted irritated because she had to go clean one. Really? Come on!!! I could go on about the food, but I won't ... I just know not to go back!"}
{"text":"We like it because we know what we're going to get. We always get a booth for two in the bar since it is less likely families will seek it out & we feel the servers work harder for you because often customers don't consider eating in the bar when they arrive. Another pro tip -- lunch menu available anytime making it possible for the two of us to get in & out for under $20. Like anywhere we've had our service hiccups over the years but when we're hungry this is always a reliable fall back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and sat in the bar area.   The Good:  Cleanliness was good and service was above average. So far so good...  The Bad:  Ordered Fajitas Trio with no beans or rice, as I have ordered countless times at other Chili's. Order came out in a timely manner.... but the food was simply terrible. My stomach churns just remembering it.   So for those who don't know, Fajitas Trio is chicken, steak and shrimp on a hot skillet with sliced onions and bell peppers.   First, the chicken came out with no grill marks, looking like a frozen breast that somebody had thrown into some hot water to cook. Zero grill marks.. I mean, can we at least PRETEND it was grilled? Isn't it supposed to sizzle like in the commercials? The chicken didn't even get grilled on the hot skillet!  Which brings me to the skillet... it wasn't hot! How are you going to serve fajitas with a lukewarm skillet? Booo! Get outta here Chilis!   The onions and bell peppers looked (and tasted) like they had been pulled from the freezer too since they had no crunchiness at all.   Shrimp is obviously frozen (this is AZ after all).   The pico de gallo, guac and shredded lettuce all looked a few days past their best by date.   You know how good things are more than a sum of their parts? This was LESS than a sum... each item was bad but collectively, it was a terrible meal especially at the price point ($15!).   So maybe my memory has failed and the food was always this bad, but something tells me that this was an exceptionally poor representation.   My friend ordered an appetizer sampler and said the sliders were meh (only ate one) as were the egg rolls.   Summary: low quality food, poor preparation. Don't go here, try any other restaurant!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is great! Greeted with two hostess with an awesome smile. So we checked in and sat down at a booth and automatically our server approached us and check us in. Waiting time for the food? not good. It took us a loooooong wait, so if your that hungry pls... save yourself. Food came in and everything looks perfect. Except one detail, the food that I got wasn't that superb. My 1st entree was a Bacon Ranch Quesadilla; it was crispy (yes!) and the steak too! burned and yes \"crispy\" which I never ordered. With that being said, I call our server Sarah and asked if its a normal to have it like that and she honestly said \"no\". and took our order and apologize (thank you for that) in a split seconds the manager Mike came and said \"what seems to be the problem?\" and I replied \"I asked if its a normal way how to cook the food? and Sarah said it was not...\" and then he replied \"Sarah don't know and that's how it is cook. And I took it out of your bill.\" and walk away... I felt like it was a rude way to handle the situation. A big no! Customer Service is always supposed to be a superb no matter how rude/unpleasant your guest is.   to make our day, Travis the other manager and apologize about what happened and very pleasant about it. Thank you.   Whole Rate:   Ambiance: 5  Customer Service: 1  Food: 2  Service: 2  Price: 5  (very affordable)   Overall experience: 1."}
{"text":"I've only been to Chili's a few times in my life, so I guess I don't have much to compare it to as far as other locations are concerned...but I wasn't really impressed.   The service was great, we were seated immediately, the waitress was wonderfully friendly. We opted for the 2 for $20 meal package to keep it on the low. We shared an appetizer of chips and guacamole/salsa, the husband chose the grilled chicken salad and I ordered the half rack of babybacks. The chips were warm, perfectly salty and I love how thin they are. The on-table trivia game kept us occupied while we devoured guacamole.   The baby back ribs were delicious. Succulent, flavorful and falling off of the bone - lick your fingers good, and the french fries were fantastic. I only ate two of them. My husband was so bummed out about his salad, that I traded him my plate for his. I thought 'how bad could it be? it's a salad!'.   It was bad. It was really bad. My tastebuds were assaulted with an overbearing onion-meets-citrus-meets-bitter-arugula. The grilled chicken wasn't seasoned well, and disappeared into the pile of greens. Every once in a while I stumbled upon a black bean, and I think someone accidentally spilled a few kernels or corn. I'm tell you this was terrible. I couldn't eat it. I picked out the bland chicken to put some protein in my belly, and threw my napkin on the plate. Done.   We utilized the incredibly helpful table-top kiosk to swipe our card to pay so we could leave, full of disappointment instead of dinner.   No more Chilis for us."}
{"text":"Ordered off of the togo menu. Food was cold which wasn't from the short ride back. No napkins and no utensils to eat the food. Payed extra for the southwest Mac and Cheese and got some cold Mac and Cheese that Strongly resembled the Kraft boxed product. It was old Kraft Mac and Cheese. Not impressed."}
{"text":"This place is always on top of there game and provide great service.  I always come and get the baby back ribs!!"}
{"text":"The service absolutely sucked! No smile no welcome and waited forever for our waiter to return. Made out outing feel like we should t have come. Just wanted to leave. Won't be returning here. Manager was of course nowhere to be found!"}
{"text":"I like Chili's, I know what I am getting so I have been here before and I do like the food here. Having said that this review is mostly about atmosphere, cleanliness and staff. The place is always fairly clean and the atmosphere is pretty good considering there are a lot of retired people here it still seems like an upbeat place especially during football games or what have you. The staff has always been very nice. Not much else to say but a great experience."}
{"text":"It turns out that I did bust something on that Heathly option bean burger but it wasn't a filling it was MY TOOTH!"}
{"text":"Our server Cassy has been super attentive and accommodating! We asked for an appetizer that contains bacon to just put the bacon on one side (I'm vegetarian; he is definitely not) and she said no problem and they would have the chef cook the halves separately! How nice :-) We are having a great time, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The only reason that this Chili's gets more than one star is because the server was courteous and helpful. Had it not been for her, this location would be all but useless. My party arrived at about 8pm. After standing unattended for about five minutes, a host came and addressed us. They set up a table for my party (6 adults, 1 preschooler, 1 newborn) and we were seated. Eventually, a server came and took our drink orders. The drinks took about 15 minutes to arrive. Once the drinks arrived, we ordered. So at this point, it was about 8:30. We finally received our food at around 9:10/9:15pm. One member of our party ordered a steak with shrimp, broccoli, and mashed potatoes. The plate was warm, but the meal was room temperature, at best. Another member ordered pasta and received cold pasta and bread that was hard as a hockey puck. I had ordered mini cheeseburgers for my daughter (the preschooler) and they arrived with no cheese. Finally, I had ordered the loaded baked potato soup and they informed me that the soup was frozen and they could not make me that soup. That's fine, but they didn't tell me this until five minutes before everyone else's food came out! I have never had such a horrid experience at a restaurant. I don't intend to return to that location. The entire detestable experience didn't conclude until close to 9:45pm after we finally got to-go boxes for our cold-served food. Hopefully a microwave will resurrect the abominations that were delivered, but sadly it will not return to me the time I wasted this evening."}
{"text":"Ate here with my family last night, and it was just an awful experience... everything I expected a chain restaurant to be.  Service was terrible, from the moment we sat down to the moment we left.  For starters, we got no place settings and had to ask for them after our appetizer arrived, so we were napkin-less for that course.  There were other problems I couldn't remember during our meal, and when we went to leave, we had to pretty much beg them to run our credit card.  Food was OK, but service couldn't have been worse.  My family has been there before, though, and they said the service isn't always that bad so.... 2 stars?"}
{"text":"Well ordering the take-out Or to-go service stinks.  Other customers who are dining there park in the to-go parking - so it's not enforced.  Every time I pick up food - I'm always missing something.  It may be a salad or a dessert but there's always something missing.    I wish they would be more organized and enforce the parking.  After spending $100 in food in 4 bags it would be easier to park a little closer and receive all my food that I paid for."}
{"text":"Cheap food, about the same prices as any Chili's which is good for an airport. I hit up this one after having a pretty positive experience at the LAX version. Unforutnately, the service here blew. The waitress was slow as molasses (Bad when your flight is in an hour). She also managed to get every part of my order wrong. Tough to do when there's all of like 3 drinks on the menu, but alas, she did.   All and all the food was good, but the service needs some serious work."}
{"text":"Our waitress seated and served us so quickly as we told her we had 30 minutes til our flight. Great service and food considering it's an airport restaurant! The server brought us chips for our kids, drinks with kids too. The mini burgers are delish and the family said the steaks were great too."}
{"text":"My husband was worried about my Yelp cred when I told him I was going to write a Yelp review for Chili's, but I told him it was my duty to report our experience. We walked in to Chili's at 6:50 on a Thursday night. Chili's was about half way full. I was actually surprised it was not very busy because it was a couple days before Christmas. Anyway, we decided to sit in the bar area. We sat down and ordered our drinks, 2 nonalcoholics, and a sampler platter. Our drinks took at least 10 minutes. I became a bit nervous because I am pregnant, and I knew I needed food in a timely manner. Our server walked around the bar area as if she were a patron---slowly and without purpose. She didn't speak to us other than to take our order and drop off the check. No convo required, but a check in would have been helpful. She also had almost every table in the bar area, which eventually filled up. Still, no sense of urgency.   The best part of Chili's is the acoustics. We could ease drop on the table next to us without a problem while we waited for our food. We heard the table complaining to the manager that their appetizer was taking forever. I was appalled to hear the manager blame the long ticket time on another table---apparently, another table stole their appetizer! Meanwhile, we are waiting for our appetizer. One appetizer ended up taking 30 minutes. I am not kidding. 30 minutes. When it arrived at 7:35, it was cold and the dressing were warm, meaning the food sat in the window for quite a while, waiting to be run to our table. As we finished our food, the table next to us finally got their food. While I know my review should be about my personal experience, I thought it was pretty interesting that the table next to us had the same level of service we did, but they actually spoke to a manager, twice. We were at this location for about 45 minutes, and the only time I saw the manager was at the behest of this irate table. Chili's is not our normal stomping grounds, and this experience reminds me why."}
{"text":"Food was decent but bar was filthy and bartender was preoccupied or just disinterested. There were wet, used rags actually on the bar, and the bar counter was still dirty. The bartender was going back and forth to the kitchen for something. It wasn't busy at all, so not sure why he kept leaving.   I say there (he looked at me in the eye) at least 4 times. On the 5th time he handed me a menu and said \"what are you having?\".  I said, \"you just have me the menu 2 seconds ago, so I'm not sure. My water tasted like it came from a river.  I love the Chili's brand but this location, particularly the bar, needs to do better."}
{"text":"Well, it was good.  The food was good.  But it took a long time to get our food. The service was friendly and attentive, it just took too long to get the actual food.  I ordered a delicious chicken salad that actually had some good heat in the sauce.  The waitress asked, \"it is hot, is that ok?\" which was nice, and I of course said, \"Yes, and bring it\".  It wasn't that hot but I can see how the average person would need to be informed of the heat.  Boyfriend got the fajita trio and liked it.  The waitress asked several times if we wanted to use the table top tablet to order more or pay, but I just didn't want to automate and mess around with processing my own order; that's what a server is for.  I'd like to just sit and relax, not figure out an online pay swipe and concentrate on \"did I do this right\"... NO.  Take my credit card, I'll sign the bill.  Hmmmm hope it's not a trend."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service is even better. When manuel is our server We really enjoy our meals."}
{"text":"I have updated my review have been back many times and not one bad time excellent great service"}
{"text":"I usually come here since I live in Anthem and service has been great but this last time it sucked. It was beyond horrible service. We got sat and I asked the hostess about the little tv on the table and she said you can re order drinks on it, play games and pay the bill. I said oh you can order food and she said no obviously I wouldn't give you a menu for that umm...okay rude! Secondly, our server greeted us with such a fake smile and fake hello. He was clearly annoyed with his day and job. He was probably like oh shit two olderly people and a young guy means my tip will suck. I used to work in the service industry and you can never judge a person on their age or looks like you can't judge a book by its cover. He was annoyed to that he could not upsell all of us but hey when your rude I won't add a salad even if I want it. He sighed as he took our order and walked away. Really?!? I know it's Chili's and all not a fine dining restaurant but still I shouldn't get treated like I'm at Denny's. Really almost with the trivia its an extra 99 cents seriously lol?!?! At Buffalo Wild Wings it's free to pay trivia and it creates a fun family experience not let's pay for it. I'm so annoyed I'm sitting here taking the time at the restaurant to write this review. So, we shall see when I get our food how the server will be with our order. So, we ordered our food at 12:00 and are still waiting....and its 12:15....I would expect a longer wait time at a busy restaurant but it's completely empty. Finally, got our food at 12:17 and omg servers need to realize when they are being sarcastic and rude. Our server did not care at all about anything and seemed annoyed. I just find it hilarious that a server is so busy with 5 tables. Really it is not that hard to handle 5 tables. I honestly don't think I will be returning to Chili's ever again. I'm tired of getting horrible service and servers who hates their jobs. If you hate your job so much then find a new one. End of story. It always amazes me how some people have jobs in the service industry.  Also, I get the tv ideal trying to be cool but that just means the servers are really lazy and need a electronic device for people to hit refill my glass and order deserts haha lazy work. Then really we had a free desert for my grandpa's birthday but our server said we only get a free scoop of ice cream. Seriously......so frustrating it's annoying!  Never coming back to any Chili's for that matter! You lost my business and you are horrible and customer service and I don't feel horrible about writing this review at all. I would rather go to Mcdonalds in the same parking lot and I would probably get treated better and I hate McDonald's.  I never eat there hahaha"}
{"text":"Slow service for the amount of tables in the restaurant (3). Our server was rude, you could tell she didn't want to be there. And our food came out cold.. All and all. Worst meal ever"}
{"text":"Over the past few months the service has gone to crap! I'm a frequent flier here who loves their food. I had a to go order once and as we came to pick up the order the cook claimed that he made the food but yet it went missing. Today as we sat the server never came and finally I stopped someone after 15 minutes and gave our order, now waiting another 25 minutes considering they're not very busy the appetizers that we ordered wasn't even out yet. Even my child is asking why is it taking so long even though she's occupied playing with the kiosk."}
{"text":"I ordered the queso with chips on 09/13/15 at about 6:30pm. I found a french fry in the queso after eating about 5 bites. The server was apologetic and brought another one, and after 2 bites, AGAIN found a fry. Both times our server told the manager (Stan) about it because we could see them, and no one ever came to talk to us or offer any compensation for the situation. I was obviously turned off from the queso and ordered the fried cheddar bites but was charged for them :-(. My family and I have been coming to this location for about 12 years at least once a week and I am not happy about how management said nothing and did nothing about it."}
{"text":"The hide gem at Chili's is the unlimited soup and salad plus chips and salsa. It is only 7$ for lunch and 9$ for dinner. They used to be a dollar cheaper, but it looks like the price was increased. BUT still a good find. I love the enchilada chicken soup. It us amazing and unlimited. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Had a good time here the service was great and our food was perfect .. so clean and friendly .. it was during their slower time .. I have no complaints"}
{"text":"Well, I walked in and two women were waiting to be seated so the hostess sat them first. By the time the hostess returned, two more women had arrived. The hostess ignored me and sat the other women before me. When she came back from seating the other two women, I was finally acknowledged with a \"hi. You're waiting for others to join you, right?\" To which I said no and she sat me.  My server was awesome, but the food took forever to come out of the kitchen. The restaurant wasn't that busy, so I don't know why I had to wait more then 20 minutes for my entree (which was a simple turkey burger).  This has been a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"We love Lynn at the bar.... Specifically come in for her.. she's awesome! She's very fast and so friendly too"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service at a great price.  I like that Chili's has 2 wait staff for each table, so you never go without refills, cold food, or waiting for your check.  They have returned back to their Tex-Mex roots, also a bit heavy on the BBQ, but I think their fajitas are where it's at. A very large portion of meat and grilled vegetables with a nice side of sour cream, guacamole, pico de Gallo, and shredded cheese, as well as a large helping of black beans and a mound of seasoned rice. They start you off with 4-5 tortillas, but more can be requested at no charge.  Also, they have a new promotion going where if you download their app, you get a free chips&salsa on every visit. The chips and salsa is very delicious (salsa is a bit spicy) and a great appetizer to munch on while waiting. I think that's really awesome instead of just a one-time offer.   Chili's has always been one of my favorite safe spots to eat because their food is creative and always very flavorful."}
{"text":"If you're in the bar area for the all day happy hour on Sunday, don't bother! All we ordered was soup salad and wings. .. It's been 30 minutes and we're still waiting"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Customer service was ok. Food was decent. Don't order the bacon burger. It taste like a Big Mac.  Everything takes so long to arrive at your table. It might not be the waiters or cooks.  It might be that management has one person waiting on 10 or more tables. They are good to sit you down tho. No waiting time with 5 hostess doing nothing but joking around. It's ok. We all should be happy at work. So no biggie but don't go there hungry you will stay hungry for a while.  Good luck.    No  chili's.  Sorry.  I won't call or email you guys back for any coupons or discounts.   Like I said this was my first time at one of your restaurant. Very disappointed and I won't go or recommend anyone to go to one of your restaurants nation wide. Sorry but not sorry   Honestly hospitality doesn't take to much to please and in a city of Las Vegas this should be key point to success in a business. If you don't believe this good luck and look at so many restaurants closing there doors down due to competition and better service.  Good luck ."}
{"text":"The meal was \"ok\" but we were overcharged for a side order of rice and beans 3.96 (these are usually .99 at our hometown Chili's) and the rice was not cooked completely. Will not be back to Chili's for a while and never to this one again. This was not worth the $30 for two nor the low quality of food. Maybe that's why the parking lot was empty....."}
{"text":"The girl that seated us was very rude in her tone of voice with us. She threw down the napkins and silverware. She said in a condescending and nasty tone \" the waitress will be with you when she can\". This girl should not be a greeter or work with the public."}
{"text":"Great experience, good tasting food, great customer service and environment. We are from out of town, but if you live in the area, I highly recommend this particular Chillis"}
{"text":"Went there last night first food was burned after waiting 40 minutes and then after sending it back it was raw. Service was a joke use to go to this location a lot but not going to go back there again!"}
{"text":"Our server was very nice and attentive and wasn't afraid to give us advice on what to order. Exceptional service from Aiden!  We really enjoyed the southwest chicken wraps and the onion and jalapeno stack as appetizers. The southwest burgers that my friends had looked and tasted delicious. I had the ribs and steak and I was very impressed as they were well seasoned and cooked perfectly! The loaded mashed potatoes were amazing as well!  Great job Aiden and Chili's!!!"}
{"text":"Went in to eat on 11-10-12 and ordered the nachos to start.  Getting toward the bottom of chips, I grabbed a handful of small chips and dip it in my salsa and start to chew, well guess what I chomped down on, a piece of glass....yes, GLASS.  Told the waiter and he took the glass and I guess told a manager but no one came to me.  Lucky for me, I didn't get hurt but still.  I proceed to eat my ribs that I love and at the end of my last rib I now pull out a long ass hair.  Now I tell the waiter again and I say, \"now I want something at least comped\". He says oh yes sir, so sorry.  Me personally, If I was the Gm at this restaurant, I would of comped the whole meal.  This guy didn't even apologize and all he gave me was 8 dollars off for my ribs.  I love the food at chilis but I will never order from this chilis ever again in my life.  Piss poor management.  I still may call to the corporate offices and explain this situation."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong here, just a typical Chili's.  I really actually like their burgers, can't lie.  To be perfectly honest though, my little 7 y/o daughter is usually the reason that I come here.  She is in love with macaroni and cheese and for some reason she associates Chili's with good mac'n'cheese.  7 year old logic at it's best!  Don't shun this place though, solid food, solid service and very affordable."}
{"text":"Say what you will but those with kids might agree, Chili's is not only an old stand-by favorite of my own but also for my little one that loves macaroni and cheese.  Having always been a fan of their burgers I have to say I've never been let down in that arena either.  Dependent on location I guess the service can be spotty but this particular one had a very attentive and polite staff that was on point and on the spot.  When in doubt you can always count on Chilis in my opinion and don't forget they have many low calorie menu options if that's what you are looking for."}
{"text":"I agree with Patrick T.  I should hate to eat here but I don't.  It's actually not a bad place to get some food.  Service is always above average."}
{"text":"In for lunch and sat and the bar. The bartender was busy and did a great job multi tasking and all around great server/bartender. If you ever visit this location be sure to sit at the bar. The bartender's name is Justine."}
{"text":"This place is the best! We've come back time and time again. The servers are friendly, the food is great, and the booths are comfy! They are very up to date and even have little machines on their tables that you can use to pay the bills and tip. No paper required! You can also play games on them too. The menu was recently updated. My mom and I love to do the 2 for $20 meal deal. We've been coming here for years and absolutely love it."}
{"text":"I'm always ready for my El Nido margarita but nobody makes it like Zach \"the proud German\". I'm always a little disappointed when I don't see him behind the bar."}
{"text":"No hostess, waited 3 mins at front, no seat yourself sign. Sat at bar, no bartender for 5 minutes then when arrived, took existing customers food orders, and took a paymet before even looked at me. Then calls me boss. I hate that  Food came, no napkins.  Had to beg for anything other than barnap at bar. Take your business to a local place, Casey moores, pedal haus,"}
{"text":"We usually come here for lunch.  The food is always good, especially their California flat bread and their service is quick too.  This location is near several business plazas which makes it even more convenient.  One thing that I love is their rewards program with self pay kiosk.  Every time you go, you earn points that can be used towards your meal. The kiosk makes paying quick, simple, and easy.   If you need to split the bill you can also do it easily.  I wish more restaurants would get on board with this."}
{"text":"The menu was extensive but very calorie heavy for me since I'm a diabetic. I got a salad, but had too much dressing on it. The wings were tasy!"}
{"text":"So I got here late. BUT: the waitress is struggling.  We found the bottom of our bottomless chips, like, 10 minutes ago. The Corona-rita is FAB though...so I'm sitting at a 3 right now.  Got the food, however...the fajitas restored my faith in large chain restaurants (or maybe it was the 'rita?).  Excellent chicken and shrimp.  Pretty busy, but it's Friday night.  Go figure.  Also next to a movie theater on the eve of Evil Dead.  That's why I was here; not sure about anyone else.  I'm sure there are better places to go with awesome food and drink, and service that is at LEAST as capable as our server, but it was convenient."}
{"text":"I like this one! Attentive servers, got our food quick and correct, and I love the pay at your table feature. Most places you can never get your servers attention when ready to go, not a problem here!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant selection at McCarran airport is terrible.  I should've went to BK and saved ten bucks. I think next time I will eat before going to the airport!"}
{"text":"We went around 9pm and the restaurant wasn't even that busy. Nobody even saw that we got in. We were waiting to be seated for almost 10 mins and we got tired of waiting so we sat in a booth. All of a sudden this waitress came and said they closed that part so she wants us to sit by the bar. When we went there the tables were dirty and nobody came to take our orders. I called for the store manager. He came over and I told him about the situation and he said what does he wants me to do. Really bad customer service and the manager don't know how to do his job."}
{"text":"Wow...and I don't mean that in a good way! It's hard for me to write a review about a business like this as my experiences are typically not this bad, but here we go: My first review that is really bad. I visited this Chili's today because I had a couple of gift cards received from the holidays and lunch was still marinating at home. I previously heard that they had a menu of 550 calorie meals. I'm not really a calorie counter, but I'm definitely health conscious and I looked at what the offerings were from the website and was impressed by their 550 calorie meals. They seemed really appetizing and filling and for the most part used unprocessed, unrefined ingredients.   Well, I arrived for lunch as aforementioned and there was no greeter. Okay...that's fine. I just waited a little. It gave me time to view the interior to get a feel for it before I go any further. I didn't like the environment. It was really dark; a lot of that of course had to do with the cloudy weather we had today. This was lunch time though and I wasn't looking for any mood lighting. The next thing I didn't like was that it felt like a bar. Now I know this wasn't a fancy restaurant, but I didn't come here to be at a bar! So minutes passed and I was getting incredibly impatient because there was still no greeter to offer me a seat. Was I free to sit anywhere I want? Defintely, NO! I was about to leave, but my companion didn't want to go and walked a little further into the restaurant to look for a server. I was facing the door at this point and someone near the bar area asked if someone was helping us. Of course, NO! We were seated. I agreed with the first seat we were offered, but after sitting there for a few seconds I realized it was just too dark. I asked if it was okay to sit by the window and was allowed to sit elsewhere.   Alas, I sat down again and looked through the menu. Where is the 550 calorie meals? I don't see it on the menu or anywhere on display at the table. I looked through the menu to see if there was anything at all that I could replace that whole idea with and the answer was NO! I wonder if the 550 calorie meals were only offered for dinner. I don't know. I didn't bother to ask either so I just walked out.  I assume this Chili's isn't always a bad deal and bad expierience, but I have to rate this visit according to my experience. ONE STAR!!! Hey, Chili's at Shea, it hurts me as much as it hurts you."}
{"text":"This place has no food on special for happy hour!  I can tell you I wasn't very happy.  We left and went to the Elephant Bar--happy hour from 3-7!!!"}
{"text":"My nephew treated me for Mother's Day, ribs are delicious, tender. seasoned well.  The service was good."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and helpful I love coming here. There host victoria is amazing she can enlighten your day from the moment you walk in so friendly and helpful. She's a very sweet women and will make sure you are taken cared of from the time she walks you to your seat till the moment you walk out the door. The manager is nice and friendly checks on you not just once like every other place. The servers are always in a good and delightful mood. This has became my new to go place. I ate there tonight due to bad experience at Friday's. This place I've been to couple times but I'll be here more often. If you guys haven't tried there honey chipotle chicken and waffle there to die for you need to go try it. I appreciate all the hard work and good customer service I get from this place and staff thank you guys!"}
{"text":"In all reality we were not expecting much, after our past experiences here... However with that being said they have really made a come back! The staff was great and on top everything. The mangers were even walking around checking on customers. Over all they have made a fantastic come back and we will gladly be eating here again! The food was perfectly cooked and well prepared and quickly brought out! Even though it was crazy packed, everyone was keeping calm and handling business well!"}
{"text":"I don't know why but it was such a sad depressing feeling dining here, and it wasn't due to the fact that my vacation had come to an end. The dullness was in the air. I ordered the triple dipper which allows you to choose 3 things from a list. I had mini sliders, artichoke dip, and eggrolls. They were all horrible. It's true that airport food tastes like crap. Waste of $35 that would've been better spent at a vending machine."}
{"text":"We have stopped here on several occasions for something different.  Today's stop was not typical.  When we went to be seated, they suggested we sit in the bar area as they had two large parties in the main dining room- one with 70 people and one with 20.  We were told that it would be difficult to take our orders and get served in the dining room.  We decided to sit in the bar area.  We didn't know it at the time, but our orders went to the kitchen right after the orders for the 70 something party.  Little did we know it would be a long wait.    After about 20 minutes, pour waitress came by and apologized for the delay and said the food would be coming soon.  She offered us chips and salsa to munch on until the food came.  We declined.  Ten minutes later, she stopped by again and asked if the manager had been by.  She said the manager would be bringing our meals presently and again she apologized.  WIthin a few minutes, the manager did bring our meals and apologized offering to give us two desserts or a discount on the check.  We declined dessert and when she brought the check, she had deducted the cost of the one meal.  That was great customer service and was certainly a way to bring us back.  The thing I wish, however, is that they would be honest up front.  Had I known the wait would have been that long, I would have gone elsewhere.  Had I known -  had they told me.  As for the food, I had chicken fajitas and my wife had their Chicken Monterrey.  Both dishes were normal Chili's dishes and everything tasted great.  It's a shame the dinner was diminished by the service issues, but I can understand the problem of dealing with that many people in one large party.  Kudos to the manager for the way she handled the situation."}
{"text":"First and LAST time at Chili's, I'm not sure if all locations are as horrible as this one but I surely won't find out. We should've known from walking in & seeing half the restaurant with dirty tables that this wasn't going to end well. Every item that we ordered came out lukewarm. Shrimp was undercooked. Unless you're looking for cold food & food poisoning I wouldn't waste money or time at this place."}
{"text":"You know Chili's on McKnight Road, I used to really like you.  Like REALLY like you.  The skillet queso, the fajitas, the chocolate lava cake.  It was amazing.  All the time.  And glorious in all its high sodium, high calorie, add some guac to that, way.  And then something happened.  They serve the sides to the fajitas in the micro-cups.  A dollop of sour cream for my fajitas?  A dollop of guac?  Get real Chili's.  The chips are inconsistent, sometimes not salted, sometimes oversalted, sometimes cold, sometimes perfect.  The fajitas them selves are usually served with barely cooked green peppers and onions instead of the previously well caramelized peppers and onions.  Find something you really like?  It's probably been significantly changed, or is gone all together.  It's just not the Chili's I used to hold so close to my heart.  The service is always great.  I like the little tablet things on the table to close your bill, though I'm sure that is a bit difficult for the tech-challenged members of society.  The restaurant is clean and I like the decor upgrades.  But all these menu changes and tweaks need to be re-evaluated.  Chili's, I'll keep coming back even though I know I shouldn't.  Someday I hope you'll return to your previous glory."}
{"text":"The food was okay. The pork ribs tasted like they were sitting around for a while. The steak and burgers were good. I love their chips and salsa. They have these video devices on every table. You can buy games for $.99 each, great for kids if you don't want to teach them to interact with those you are dining with. You can swipe through the menu on this device but there were four of us so we used the actual menus given us. You can also pay for your bill with this device which is convenient. The hostess explained all this to us. We wanted this thing off our table and the hostess said we had have it on the table. What?! I removed it and then she said, oh I guess you don't want this but we really don't have any other place for it. Well the shelf behind us worked just fine. The floor would have been my next option. :) When it came time to pay the bill we computed the tip in our heads, 20% but the device gave us a different amount for 20%, a dollar and change more. I took out my handy dandy phone calculator and yes our figure was correct and not the device. Why I have no idea. Maybe they want you to tip the tax.  Chili's stick to better food and stop trying to make a few extra dollars on these gimmicks. We probably won't consider Chili's the next time we want to dine out. Not with all the other places we can go."}
{"text":"Ok I haven't eaten at Chili's since there late 90's due to the fact that their food was horrible but my boyfriend wanted fajitas for dinner from here so I said what the heck I'll give it a shot expecting to get just a salad I saw the tacos on their menu and they looked ok so I tried them and I have to say they were good for a basic taco it's still hard to find a great taco here in Arizona when you've grown up in Los Angeles for 45 years and use to authentic Mexican food but the food  was good and I'd try Chili's again ."}
{"text":"Fast service and staffs were truly working as a team during my visit absolutely awesome. I sat at the booth in bar area for happy hour.   At this time, 3 items for $10 which included house salad, choices of a burger and dessert are so worth it.  Lucky me! I catch $5 special deal on premium margarita as well.  Plenty of parking spaces around.  Conveniently pay at the table and earned some point for next visit.  Will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Ordered the sirloin medium well with an extra side of brocolli through roadrunner. Received a blood red RARE steak and a single order of brocolli. Would not use again."}
{"text":"My family came to chili's on 3/18/17 to celebrate the life of my mother and we did have a fairly big party.  We all arrived at abt 3:00p and was told it would be a 30 min wait. Ok, no problem.  The location was understaffed and had only abt 3 servers working. The location was not cleaned because of the amount of servers.  Most of the tables were empty but piled dishes still left on the tables from the last parties sitting there.   At about 430p the manager comes to apologize about the wait and stated it would be another hour until more staff came in and gave out $5 gift cards to two people, but should've given everyone in the party one because everyone was all waiting at the same time. We did tell the manager that it didn't matter if we sat together or not because we knew it was a lot of us.   We ended up leaving and going to a different restaurant. It used to be an overall good spot to go to. I enjoy the house margaritas. The service has truly went down hill. I only gave two stars for the attempt of the two gift cards. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Food is chilis quality, nothinng too special. sometimes service is good (being served by one person) and sometimes it terrible v(was served by over 6 people and messed up order. i just like the margaritas"}
{"text":"If you're looking to wait over an hour for COLD entrees with a side of slow service, this is your place!! With your bad experience, you get a FREE upgrade to a careless manager!"}
{"text":"Eher Mittelmäßig, Geschmack gut aber auch nicht mehr, Service gut allerdings nicht aufmerksam genug, haben einen Burger vergessen. Sich entschuldigt aber leider vergessen. Vielleicht kommen wir nochmal wieder und testen es erneut."}
{"text":"The kitchen looked filthy. Food all over the floor and no one in sight working to clean it up either. On my way back from the bathroom I could see into the kitchen. I was grossed out. We left without eating. You may want to skip eating here too."}
{"text":"We had a really great experience here! I ordered the Sunrise Burger and it was absolutely incredible. It went really well with the Blue Moons I had. For an appetizer, I had the boneless wings with barbecue sauce and those were awesome as well. Our server was also very nice. She kept checking on us and handled our every request. The restaurant itself is very lively. This particular Chili's is more like a sports bar. It has a good vibe. I plan to return!"}
{"text":"Chili's consolidated and now there are only four in the valley.  It had been VERY long since I've been to this location.  It was conveniently on our way, so we stopped in for dinner.  The food was eh and the service was spotty.  We were adulting and came in sans children.  Seated in the bar area in a booth.  The waiter was quick to ask and obtain our drinks.  We ordered our food.....  It took what felt like 15 minutes to get our appetizer.   I will say that the Texas fries no jalapeño were tasty.  Our main course were the problem.  After drop off, wait staff disappeared for an extensive period of time.  I got the chicken fajitas and it's hard to mess them up.  There was no where to put the fajita down except the sizzling pan.  Husband asked for side of mayo and ketchup, but didn't happen.  After about 10 minutes of husband getting progressively pissy, I walked up to the bar and \"borrowed\" the ketchup.  The bartender came up then and asked if we needed more ketchup, as the bottle was limited.  I said yes.  Then magically the waiter returned and we got drink refills.  Husband never did get the side of mayo.  And his bacon cheeseburger was so greasy he didn't finish it.  (We are talking about a man who NEVER walks away from food.).   We tipped exactly 15%, which is how we show our displeasure.  Won't return to this location."}
{"text":"Tasha was amazing! Great service! Will come back just for her! Our Santa Fe Chicken salads were great!"}
{"text":"I love Chili's & our server, Diane was great (5 stars for her!!!) But thanks to the rude hostess, she made the rating 2 stars. I think it's rude to turn your back to customers when you see them walk in! She might as well have said GET LOST. Whatever she was \"doodling\" could have waited. I don't think I'll return to this location."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar before my flight and ordered a Bloody Mary and a vodka tonic (I know) before my Santa Fe Crispers Salad. The bartender was so helpful and let us know that breakfast was still available but it was a no for me dog. Get a double shot for every drink you order here. Trust me. The salad was very filling and the tenders were crisp! I really appreciated how welcome the staff made me feel and even though it's a chain, I felt a sense of local charm here. Everyone at the bar became friends before they departed for their flights. I fell straight asleep as soon as I boarded my flight."}
{"text":"Charlotte is like the Queen City of chain restaurants. This is a decent chilies serving your American food with a twist. Staff greet you when you enter. Sat at the bar and asked for a margarita. Don't get the margarita it is pre made and very weak. I suggest getting the ones off the menu like the presidente or Patron. The food is fresh and service was good. I had the pick three for the appetizer and split the guacamole burger. Didn't bother to take a picture of it because we changed the bread, etc. it didn't look like the menu one. The bathrooms were clean. I can say it's low key and nice place to stop by and grab a quick bite. If your craving chilies and can't get a quick seat use google there is one 5-10 minutes up the road at another shopping center."}
{"text":"I love Chili's and so do my little ones. Upon their resounding request, we came.   Today the service is a little slow, but normally service is on point.  I give a pass, b/c when we walked in every table was sat and it seemed pretty tense. My server was nice and friendly nonetheless and our food was great.   Ordering dessert from the Ziosk was pretty nice as well.   Keep up the good work Chili's!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks took forever which was no surprise since sitting down also did. All our food (fries, wings and burger) were ice cold after a ridiculous wait. Salad was wilted and mushy. When team leader was informed, we were offered a discount lol what a joke Don't eat here!!"}
{"text":"We've been regulars at Chili's all over the west coast so I wasn't expecting this to be any different. We've never been disappointed, so that isn't an issue. It's one of Matt's favorite places. For me, I'd rather find something special when in Las Vegas because there are so many great places to eat here. Having said all that, this Chili's is something special. The food comes to you fresh, hot, and tasting fresh. The wait staff is friendly and works as a team. Someone other than your waiter may stop by the table to top off your drink and ask if everything is OK. Matt is great in the small talk department and the waitress enjoyed chatting since it was a slow time. It was like stopping by a friends place for dinner. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Thank you Chili's for the Military Discount! We came here yesterday for lunch and I was really pleased to put my usual Shrimp Caribbean salad that I ALWAYS ordered here back on my repertoire.  I stopped ordering it for a while because they re-vamped it and it was not really up to par.  However, since we came for lunch I wanted a salad and so glad I ordered it.  The old salad use to have crispy tortilla strips and pico de gallo, they have since replaced the strips with cranberries and took off the pico and added more pineapple. The result is fabulous.   We were out celebrating and knew by coming here the kids would have a healthy option and great service-which we consistently get.    We had a strawberry Presidente margarita and I highly recommend! It was soooooo good!  Did I mention the fab service? Did I mention we come here a few times a month and use our coupon! Buy one adult meal and get a kid's meal free!  Result? $20 dinner!  Yum! Go Now!"}
{"text":"Nicole was our server, and I think she made whay could have been an average meal a great one.   Let's be honest, nobody expects a mind - blowing experience from a chain restaurant,  so if you have one of these experiences,  it must be attributed to the people working there.   Hats off to Nicole and whomever is the manager there.   What follows is not what happened on our visit,  rather how it felt...  I was ushered in with my family in tow and Nicole,  our server,  floated in on a cloud and used her telepathic powers to bring my family drinks, the water was from the east side of a melting glacier, the beer was brewed by a sole Belgian, one glass at a time, and cooled in an Arctic pool.  I cannot remember what we ordered, but I am certain it was consumable food that made everyone better people.  We ate and understood the universe, pairing the the cosmos with the grand terrain of this floating rock we call Earth.  We told Nicole of our familial epiphany, and she nodded with a warm smile.  \"That's why I do this...to change lives.\"  With that, she teleported to the kitchen right before our eyes.  A warmth enveloped all of us and we reflected on human existence for 37 minutes before driving home.  I woke up the next morning and I am not the same.  I am better.  I will beat on, a boat against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.  Shout out to The Great Gatsby."}
{"text":"Luckily, the food was good because the service was a little lacking. We were there for nearly 20 minutes before anyone even took a drink order from us. I ordered the ribs and they were more chipotle than honey. I wasn't prepared for the kick, but I think that's my fault. The server did have a good sense of humor but he lacked some attentiveness."}
{"text":"My experience at this restaurant was poor... Very poor. But you may have a different hopefully better experience while visiting.  We sat in the bar area since its self seating and after being there for a while a server finally runs by and says I'll be with you shortly to run to help a huge party who down after us. So we switched to the dining room.   We told our server about this experience and she told the manager who came and apologized which was great. Then the bar area server comes in w/ a defensive I'm sorry but ... Using but while saying sorry is never a good thing #TotallyAwkward  Then we are able to order and this server did a much better job and was nice. I ordered a salad asking for no carrots because I am incredibly allergic and the salad came with carrots. Honesty, complaining would have been pointless.  Our fajitas came delivered by a man who said nothing and awkwardly shoved them on the table. The fajitas weren't even sizzling! The server came and we told her so she brought them out sizzling. At this point we were tired and over it and just wanted to leave.  This place seems a little under staffed and I was not very impressed. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Awesome friendly and fast service from Sarah tonight, and my steak was cooked to perfection! Good job Chili's!"}
{"text":"Great service from the bar staff!  Happy hour at Chili's in Goodyear is fun even before the drinks are consumed.  Toby and Rebecca are awesome and there are two others that provide great service; however I cannot recall their names. Service in the dining room was so so the last time that I had it."}
{"text":"I'm giving Chili's one star solely on the friendliness and attentiveness of my waitress, Jordan. When I first walked in I should have known it was gonna be awful. I wasn't seated and the hostess stood there the entire time. She pointed at tables and said pick one. We didn't get menus or one of those tablet things until about 20 minutes into sitting there and there was no line or wait. After paying for my replacement burger, that was equally as awful, Management didn't give us any discount for my second burger. My first burger came out raw, our Texas cheese fries were stale, you could tell they had been prepared and had been sitting under a lamp. They forgot the Mac and cheese for my wife. Which isn't a big deal, what makes it god awful was my replacement burger was extremely greasy where it made my bun soggy and it dripped like a broken faucet onto my plate. I couldn't eat all of it. I paid for a awful burger. Was comped for the first one at least, right?  Awful. Disgusting. I don't even want to think about how this kitchen runs, and I've been in the food industry as a Chef for over 3 years. What a nightmare."}
{"text":"My girl and i walked into Chili's thinking it was applebee's .....lol. I had their new chicken avocado on a pretzel roll sandwich . VERY TASTEY !  check it out. Good service..."}
{"text":"Ridiculously small restaurant for an international airport. Hardly any seating and the seating that is there is cramped and uncomfortable looking.  Petty well rubbing shoulders with the next table. Can't comment on the food - couldn't get a seat.  But if you are looking for a quiet place to relax before the flight, this isn't it!  It's behind security for the A gates.  if you want table service and nice atmosphere go to Montana's on the departures level if you have the time."}
{"text":"This was your usual Chili's.  Service was good and the food was great without the expensive prices found in the casinos.   Definitely get out and give it a try if you're in Vegas. Give your wallet a break."}
{"text":"This is my last resort. Lower that Friday's. Sorry Chili's but in my early college years you were my best friend, but now.... Meh....blah....yeah. My husband is a burger guy so he talked me into going after a trip to Costco. I thought I was safe with the new Avocado Burger. Apparently not. Shouldv'e stuck to the Chicken Crispers that got me through school before I learned to cook. First, the waitress didn't ask how I wanted the burger cooked so I guess \"Tire\" is the norm. Hard and overcooked, but hungry and not in the mood I scarfed it down. No flavor or sauce, very bland. Even the brownie sundae at the end couldn't cheer me up. It was UNDER cooked, as soon as I put my fork in it, i realized they forgot to cook it. The outside held up but inside was just batter. Ugh. Things I do for my husband."}
{"text":"Had a gift certificate for here. Had deluxe burgers and fries - juicy and tasty and delicious. Service was fast and polite. Extra helpful waiter. Food was warm. It wasn't the cleanest restaurant but it was very good and quick food."}
{"text":"I like this location a lot the parking is a little weird because the area is really busy and it's surrounded by other restaurants but this chili's itself is nice and clean"}
{"text":"Took my cousin here for her birthday she loved it I was underwhelmed by the whole thing but I suppose it is what you expect from a chili's"}
{"text":"Chilis is one of my favorite restaurants. I'm a lifer!!! I eat at this Chilis at least once every two weeks. Food is always what you expect from Chilis, reasonably priced and delicious. The floor in the restaurant looks the same every time I go in. There is always trash on the ground and on a slow night, there is usually 8-10 unbussed tables. The bathrooms are usually a wreck too. Customer service is always pleasant but there is no attention to detail when it comes to the cleanliness."}
{"text":"First off we have not been to a Chili's in about five years.  We ended up there on a whim on Wed night just to check it out since we haven't been there in so long.  In the main dining room the ambiance was way too bright and the temperature in there was freezing. So unfortunately we were already uncomfortable before we even ordered our food. We began with two appetizers,  the wings and some queso.  Both were OK nothing great.   Then on to dinner.  My hubby had prime rib and carnitas fajitas and he said they didn't deliver and wouldn't recommend them or have them again,  I had mango chili chicken.  My mouth was confused the whole time.  The seasonings were way over done,  I was constantly trying to figure out if the seasoning was sweet or spicey.  They were two different flavors fighting for the attention of my taste buds,  very confusing.    Although the server did her job and was pleasant enough.  She was clearly just going through the motions, with no personality or welcoming attitude.  Overall we left feeling like we wasted $60 and were both unimpressed with the whole lame experience.  Won't be back!"}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to use her Chilis gift card she got for Christmas. The Resturant was really crowded but I like the fact that \"Yelp\" has teamed up with Chilis and your cell phone to let you know how many parties are in front of you. What I didn't like is the hostess telling me 15 minute wait and it was 55 minutes. There were so many open tables but no one around to clean them for guest to eat which made everyone waiting upset as we stood there in the line out the door. The waiter didn't wait our table like he should maybe because he was more concerned about the table beside us that had more people. I had to keep asking for a refill. He forgot our straws, napkins, forks and he never asked us were we ok or how was our food. I just got the Chicken Nachos appetizer which was cold and my kid got a burger, so she was happy but I wasn't at all. I rolled my eyes 100 times and could have screamed but I stayed because it was my little girls treat."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy chili's. But this restaurant in particular really irks me in regards to my experience. I came here with a buddy of mine and we ordered the queso to start, which was extremely cold. I didn't say anything because it was manageable. I ordered my burger without bacon(due to religious reasons) and it came with bacon. I told the server and she apologized and brought it to the kitchen and told me they'd make me another one, I marked my burger before doing so to assure that'd be the case. And lone behold, the burger came back, except it wasn't a new one. I told the server that it was the same burger, and she was shocked. She brought it back to the kitchen and brought me a new one that was scalding hot. Lone behold it was the same burger that had bacon on it just flipped over to the other side as if I wouldn't notice. Shameful."}
{"text":"I am an avid Chili's goer and know what to expect each time I hit one.  The server was really nice, but the wait was amazingly long. It took almost 15 minutes before we got our drinks and by the time we got out appetizers (Texas cheese fries) the fries were soggy under plastic cheese. The foos was okay (which was 40 minutes after we ordered). The place was no more busy than a typical dinner rush, we even were seated pretty quickly.  I enjoyed my experience, but the food was definitely sub-par, not sure I would probably come back."}
{"text":"I was in chilis and an employee was doing his business in the bathroom. He proceeded to walk out without washing his hands. Enter the kitchen and hug and high five several employees. Disgusting.   Train YOUR STAFF."}
{"text":"My turkey sandwich was excellent and my husband enjoyed the chicken enchilada soup. His quesadilla tasted good but was sloppily put together. Two pieces had no sante fe sauce on them but 1 piece had a glob of sauce. Overall the service was good."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch! The food was ok, nothing special! Tasted like every other chillis I have been too! The decor on the other hand was nicer than most chillis! Our waitress did not seem too sure about what she was doing! Not bad if you need something quick to eat!"}
{"text":"After not eating at a Chili's for over ten years I decided to give them another try.   Really glad I did.   I have come back at least four times in two months.   Everything I have tried has been surprisingly great.    Items I have ordered on my previous visits include, guacamole and salsa, chicken strips, both original and crispy, fajitas, classic sirloin, ribs, corn, mashed potatoes, spinach and artichoke dip, \"big mouth bites.\"   Also, have had their house margaritas and specialty margaritas and they are awesome.   Service has been polite and efficient.  Servers have knowledge of the menu items.  If you sign up for their e-mail club you are periodically sent promotional coupons.    Give them a try.   You will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Took my two youngest daughters to dinner there tonight. Everyone was super friendly and we were seated immediately. JP our server was especially phenomenal. He was even willing to take a picture with them for Red Nose Day.  Baby back ribs with Dr. Pepper sauce is awesome! Highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"In the mood for some chili and parked in front of, guess what?, Chili's.  Been feeling under the weather lately and a good cup of chili should do.  Might as well get chili at a place named Chili's.  I wanted to minimize how many people I got sick, so I opted to enter through their To-Go entrance. Plus, I'm getting my food to go. Makes perfect sense.  The problem with their To-Go area is that no one was there to take my order.  So, I sat and sat and sat.  While I waited, I could hear a bunch of their servers giggling from the kitchen.  I must have had my invisible cloak on today.  After about 5 minutes of zero service, which felt like an hour, I decided to make my presences known.  The best way to do this is enter their kitchen.  So, I did.  That immediately got the chatter to stop and my order taken.  Finally!!!   Pretty sure they can tell I was irritated because the guy taking my order seemed to go above and beyond with great customer service. Good save Chili's    I ended up getting the Enchilada Chicken Tortilla Soup and Sliders w/extra Onion Strings.  I know I originally came in for their chili, but remembered how good their Enchilada Tortilla Soup was. I only ordered the sliders because I haven't got any protein since the day prior.  Got my order in less than 15 minutes, took it home, and within 30 minutes was a happy man.  Love their Tortilla Soup!!!  Been to this Chili's 2 other times, but just for appetizers and drinks.  Service didn't start out good today, but ended great.  Again, good save and I plan on coming back.   NOTE:  Food to go always seems smaller than when you eat it there.  Just a thought for the next time I order To-Go.  Just means I need to order more."}
{"text":"Came in on Cinco de Mayo to get some chain Tex/Mex food. They had an all you can eat fajitas special on a Monday night. Sat at the bar since NO ONE was in it and got great service from bartender. My first draught beer was a little warm, but the second was nice and cold! Kitchen took forever to get my order out with people coming in after me getting their food before. The fajitas where very good indeed after the wait. Since I got all you can eat, they give you progressively less so your stomach can catch up which is good cause the steak was very filling!  You really can never go wrong with these guys, but just keep in mind to pace yourself. Chips and salsa are always a good thing here to say the least!"}
{"text":"My coworkers wanted to go to Chili's for lunch today... I had a less-then-stellar experience my last visit, but when your boss is offering to buy you lunch, you go where he wants to go.  It was a group of 5, with 4 of us arriving together and the 5th showing up a little late. We were seated promptly, our waiter came over shortly after to take our drink orders. He carded me, and since I well over the legal drinking age I am always happy when I get carded. Chips and salsa came out shortly afterward.  After looking over the menu and coming to our decisions we placed our orders. I asked our waiter which of the two salads I was considering he preferred, and he said the quesadilla explosion salad was his favorite so I went with that. He pointed out that the salad comes tossed with the citrus dressing, and asked if I would prefer it on the side... I said I would.  Sadly my salad came out tossed in the dressing. Why ask if you aren't going to make it happen? My boss requested mustard for his burgers, after waiting a few minutes we ended up flagging down a second server to get it.   Overall the food was better this visit but there are still some issues with service that should be worked out..."}
{"text":"Absolute horrible service. The waitress didn't care about us, and simply said \"my bad\" when she screwed up our drink order. We practically had to beg for refills and she wouldn't even pick up our empty glasses and appetizer plates. We got up and walked out before our entrees came because of her shitty attitude."}
{"text":"Each time I order a complicated order to go,  these guys get it right. I was extremely impressed with the customer service and efficiency of my service and order, specifically today,  thanks Martin for all of your help."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to stop with friends for a beer with a REALLY cold glass after a long outdoor activity. The food is a little inconsistent so we tend to go for drinks and snack food with fiends. Besides, how can you really go wrong with cold beer and queso?"}
{"text":"Have never been a fan of any Chili's locations or menu choices BUT, I went here for lunch with my son and I may be a fan now. The menu has been updated and the classic turkey sandwich is probably the best turkey sandwich I have ever had!!  Wait staff was very attentive and super friendly."}
{"text":"Our waitress was terrible. She never came to check on us after we received our food. She bounced in to refill our drinks with no ice and never asked about the food. She was busy arguing with her coworkers about who was and wasn't going to do what. After several minutes of no service we finally flagged down another waiter, Adam. He took care of us and got us a manager who addressed the problems and credited our bill. We had our ticket transferred to Adam but we probably will never come back to this particular restaurant."}
{"text":"This has got to be the slowest Chili's I've ever been to! I'm not sure if they were short handed or are just slow, but I met up with family yesterday for a late lunch around 2:30. The place was pretty empty so I thought we'd be seated right away. There was one lady and her 2 little girls in front of me waiting to be seated when I got there. We stood there 5 minutes before anyone noticed that there were people waiting to be seated. The lady was seated immediately, but when the hostess came back and asked how many in my party, she told me that I'd have to wait as they needed to clean off tables. After about 10 more minutes we were finally seated and by this time there were about 10 or 12 more people waiting to be seated as well.   Once seated, it took time for our waitress to come around to get our drink order. Once she did come around she was quick to bring out our drinks. We ordered our food quickly as we knew it would take time for our food to come out. While we waited for our food I took the time to look around the restaurant and saw that there was no one at the bar, lots of tables were empty but still dirty, floors didn't look like it had been swept since the day before and there were employees just standing around. As I passed the waiting area on my way to the bathroom, I heard people complaining about having to wait and no one coming to the front to seat them. This is very disappointing and not good customer service in my opinion.   Food took almost an hour to come out and only 3 people in my party ordered food!! Not sure what took so long as my party only ordered 1 appetizer, a burger and I ordered tacos! Despite the lack of customer service and the slow service, the food was delicious!! My tacos were actually amazing! The chicken was moist, lots of toppings, perfect amount of sauce, and the rice and black beans were also delicious. The other people in my party said their food was also very good. If nothing else, I'd come back just for the food.   Even though our waitress was really slow, she had a great smile, was super friendly and was upbeat."}
{"text":"I usually come to this location about once a month as I live on the strip and it's one of my favorite places to come as it has an amazing view from the strip and a great happy hour after 9 o'clock.  well why the 1 star well they're supposed to be open till 11 today I come in and at 10:05 the doors locked I'm thinking it must be a mistake somebody accidentally locked the door so I wait 10 minutes till a customer walks out then Joanne ask a staff member who says oh they closed early because it slow are you kidding me your a restaurant location on the strip .    I asked the pregnant manager if corporate would know they closed early and she said yes they do it's no big deal because they're slow funny thing was the next morning I called the corporate 800-number and they laughed and said absolutely not this place be closing the sad part is I love this Chili's location but I have to leave at one star so the right people read it and see that they're shutting it down early.  The pregnant manager also said it would cost us more to keep the doors open like are you kidding me you're a Chili's you're in business it's not gonna cost you that much to keep the doors open I think your rent is a hell of a lot more than that.    Please fix this problem because if it happens again I will never be back"}
{"text":"I have always LOVED chilis, and I go past all other locations due to their uncleanliness to go to this one.   BUT, Saturday night a hostess was carrying a pants-less baby around the kitchen. The diaper was sagging and the kid had no shoes, no socks on, and had an obvious cold with boogers on its face. IN THE KITCHEN. And they were passing the baby around for everybody to hold. Then the baby was sat on the window where the cooks put the food for the waiters to take to customers. Not only is this nasty, it was dangerous for the baby    I won't be back after this, the manager didn't seem to mind at all that this was going on as he  was in the kitchen holding the baby as well. I hope they can clean up their act, as it hurts me to not go there anymore :("}
{"text":"Poor service, poor food...I've been to other Chili's and this is probably the worst I've been too.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great experience in this place! The server was great! And the manager was great!  Our food was late coming out, so they didn't charge us for the meal. Regardless, it was delicious and perfectly cooked. Kudos to the manager, really made our night.  We also had other meals from the wonderful menu. I had the quesadilla and it was plentiful! I would recommend it in a heartbeat, saucy, flavourful, and colorful. Can't ask for more.  One negative was the appearance of the restaurant, looked out of date. Need some TLC and would be bump into the 5 star."}
{"text":"To start, I used to hate Chili's. Was dragged as a kid to family dinners, lol! Now twice that age and a couple recent revisits- I love Chili's!!!! Great food, cool atmosphere, bold dining, and friendly staff; I always suggest Chili's for place to eat. The chips/salsa to start is my favorite, warm and I love restaurant-style salsa, (try the salsa ranch!) Mango tea is a must, and they have great mixed drinks, too! Awesome margaritas! I plead guilty when accused with ordering the same thing every visit, but I just like what I like!!!!   Thanks Jennifer S for the great service! Reminding me to give my best, too!  Recent remodeling has really turned this place around. Give it a second shot!"}
{"text":"Worst Chili's we have been to.  We tried a sirloin steak meal and chicken fajitas. The food was just down-right gross.  The steak was the worst ever and the chicken for the fajtas tasted like they microwaved some frozen chicken product from Sam's Club.  To top it off, the service was just as bad as the food."}
{"text":"We sat in the lounge and were so surprised of the quality of the food and the service. We haven't been to Chili's in years, so we were thrilled with the change. Plus they have these cool mobile devices at each table where you can reorder drinks or check out and pay right from this device. Try going to Chili's on Tatum Blvd., and sit in the lounge."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant with very good service and food. Sit at the bar and enjoy watching sports on the numerous monitor. The young lady bartender was very attentive. Good place for fast food to watch the games."}
{"text":"It's not a trip to Vegas without a stop at an outlet mall, and it was for that reason that we found ourselves at a Chili's for lunch.  After a quick perusal of the lunch menu, I noticed a pretty fantastic deal wherein you get a starter and a main for $8. Sold!  For my appetizer, I went with the chili (Slow-cooked chili with beef, onions & chiles. Topped with cheese.) Chili at Chili's! How could I not?  This was about as mediocre a chili as I can easily recall eating. It tasted like it came direct from some kind of a mix, and it was totally lacking in anything even resembling spice. The direct-from-a-bag shredded cheese atop the dish didn't help matters, surely.  And although I chose to drink water, my dining companion elected to try a cocktail. Now, I know our waitress heard the order because she checked my dining companion's identification. But did a cocktail ever arrive to our table? It sure didn't!  For my main, I ordered the Pork Carnitas Fajitas. When it finally did arrive, I popped open the little container that's meant to hold the tortillas...and immediately noticed that it was completely empty. I flagged down our increasingly inept waitress and pointed out the issue, which, to her credit, she quickly rectified. The dish itself was just so-so, and I've honestly never eaten fajitas without guacamole, so that was a pretty shocking omission in my eyes.  My favorite part was at the end of the meal when our waitress asked us to give her a positive review on an online survey so she can \"get better shifts.\" Get real, weirdo."}
{"text":"I came in with my boys. The chips and salsa are good. I am a creature of habit here and usually order the salad and chili. The chili was horrible on this visit. It had a soup like consistency. It was gross. I prefer local, family owned restaurants, to chains. I am not sure that I will be back."}
{"text":"Visited the Chili location at 7530 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV on Sunday August 13 at 7:09pm  They have Happy Hour all Day on Sundays  I ordered a 805 Beer but was told by the server it was not part of the Happy Hour since it was considered a local craft beer.   805 is not brewed in Vegas or Nevada.  Told the server it sounded more like FALSE ADVERTISING.  The server said he would have the Manager come by our table.   Manager never showed.    Very Poor Customer Service and FALSE ADVERTISING.  Shame on Chili's Management   STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION."}
{"text":"We went here for a late lunch. We were greeted by Greg. Initially I thought he was polite and friendly. I realized that he was a bit \"too friendly\" when he sat at our table while taking the order. I did not mind that, but I though it was a bit odd. Furthermore, at one point he put his foot on a chair in a \"captain Morgan\" pose while talking to us. Also,  we had to hunt him down for everything. When the food was ready, he brought our food out with someone else's. He dropped our food off and not once came to check on us. Even when we hunted him down for our check, he never asked how everything  was. He told my boyfriend to \"sit down\" when he went to hunt Greg down for a check. I know he was joking around, but it was just the wrong timing (not to mention that you have to have a limit on what you say to the customer). I did not like my enchilada soup and I did not eat it, however, since the server never came by I never had a chance to tell him. At the end we were in there such a long time, I thought I will gladly pay for the nasty soup so that I don't have to wait for another hour. Lastly, the restaurant was dead and we sat next to two dirty tables for the majority of our visit. A lot of room for improvement."}
{"text":"Been to this location several times and is usually pretty good.  Last night went and ordered chicken nachos and some chicken crispers keeping it easy.  Nachos ok, crispers seemed like they were either frozen for a very long time or just under cooked; rubbery and just not very good.  Will be back but obviously got to watch what we order at this location."}
{"text":"This location, although convenient, really has crap service. I always come here w my sister and it's usually not busy yet the service is so horrendous. Took forever to get our food (40min) and all we ordered were appetizers and a lunch combo quesadilla. After she gave us our food she only came back once to ask if everything was okay."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! I love Chilis and I came here thinking it'll be the same as the Chilis I usually go to in California but NO. My boyfriend and I came and wasn't helped for a good ten minutes. There were only like three guy servers and they were acting like it was a full pact place, but no it was totally empty. They made eye contact with us and no one helped. Until some guy came and said have you guys been helped and he didn't even introduce himself. Total disrespectful. But thanks to him I finally got some water. The couple by us even had to ask someone for water because no one had helped them and they ended up walking out and leaving. Then a group of girls came and of course they got helped in less then two minutes. Lame. But I guess that's what happens when a bunch of young guys work in a restaurant. The food is good just overall the service killed my experience."}
{"text":"This location is the best. I have never had bad service. Sarah is the best but we've never been disappointed with any server there. Its chili's. Its not a 5 star restaurant people. Even when its busy our food always comes out within a reasonable time. The staff really cares about the customers here. My kids love this place!"}
{"text":"Same as any other Chilis but the last time I went here the service was much more than I expected.  The place was busy but the staff seemed very friendly.  The server never let my cup reach the bottom.  When the steak I ordered came out she asked if I would cut it and see if it was the way I wanted it.  Such a simple request and yet it made me so happy.  Instead of running away and coming back in fifteen minutes to check on us, she stayed to make sure the food was perfect before walking away.  If more places were like this it would save a bunch of heartache and spit out food."}
{"text":"We were there about two weeks ago, it was good service considering we had a woman who was training but super nice she did great for her first night ;)  I'm really soooo disappointed we noticed this about a year or two ago, but why in the hell would Chili's change their taste of their Cajun Chicken Pasta?!?! Everyone I know loved I mean I still get it everytime in hopes it will taste like it used to and it never does :( not sure why they changed that but it was a big dumb idea! Lol everything else was good, the Togo girl brought out our appetizer on an extremely hot skillet and not thinking placed in front of our 8mo old who immediately grabbed it and started crying. But she was ok, and I know not everyone thinks of that. But it was ok."}
{"text":"I been here at this location one time before and the service was so bad my wife did not want to eat any more. So we gave it another try because I live close by and did not want to drive far. We had the cajun chicken pasta it was like eating a TV dinner with bad service once again I will never go back"}
{"text":"The food is over priced for how regular it is, the place is messy, and it took atleast an hour for me and my girlfriend to receive our food. Our waiter was a nice guy but seemed super swamped over the 3-4 tables he had. This place really needs to hire bussers because there was about 5 dirty tables just around where we were sitting! This is ridiculous, people come in and have to wait ten minutes to get a seat even though there are several unoccupied tables. It was my first time at chilis and will definitely be my last."}
{"text":"Given it multiple try's food is always blah . This location is not the best . Slow service and just the quality of the food seems poor"}
{"text":"It's my fault I continue to come here out of  convenience. Every time I'm kicking myself. The food is always bland and horribly late. I can't even rely on the booze to make me a happy camper. At this point I know it's not random. This is always off target and failing to meet the customers needs. After an hour I finally got my food.. The plates were hot and the food was not."}
{"text":"It might seem weird to give a chain restaurant like Chili's 5 stars but it is definitely because of the service we receive. We usually go in the evenings before or after we've gone to see a movie and we like to sit at the bar. The best bartender is Mark, hands down. He is a font of information and recommendations on the menu as well as just an interesting guy to talk to. He is exactly what a good bartender needs to be; engaging, friendly, approachable and attentive.   As for the fare, we are currently in love with the Presidente Margarita and the pineapple/blueberry infused Margarita. They have a huge carafe with alcohol sitting behind the bar and tons of fresh fruit just marinating in it, Yum! We also like the Texas fries, the flatbreads and wings. If you don't like too much sauce they will make them dry and let you dip to your hearts content. Next time we visit we'll be trying the triple meat fajitas; steak, chicken and shrimp!"}
{"text":"We went to this location a few years ago on our last Vegas trip, and we happened to go back this time for lunch on a Monday. The food is much cheaper than any Strip restaurant, and I remember hearing that the ingredients and recipe are consistent between restaurants.  Chili's has good food. I don't remember what exactly we ordered last time, but it was tasty. This time, I had the turkey sandwich, which was complemented by honey mustard and sweetened bacon. If you don't like foods that taste too sugary, I guess you might find this distracting. Personally, I loved it.  Another person had the pulled pork sandwich. I sampled some of the meat and sauce. Both were excellent, imo. The meat was tender and the sauce was sweet (again) with a bit of a spicy kick. I actually started dipping fries in the sauce later on because I couldn't stand to waste it.  Two good experiences here, so I'm giving it four stars on the Yelp scale of stars."}
{"text":"First time at this location, I will say this location is one of then best ones I have been to in a LONG time. Service was great, food was so good and our waiter as amazing! I wish I remembered his name. Will be going back here :-)"}
{"text":"Had a very delicious early dinner this evening. Ordered the 2 for $22 chips and salsa, chicken crispers and chicken fajitas. Service was excellent. Our waitress was so nice and very attentive. We never had an empty glass. Fajitas were great with all the extras that came with it.  Will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"I love Chilis and I always search them out when ever I travel. But unfortunately this was the most disappointing visit I have ever had. We made our reservation online and got a confirmation text but when we got there, at the exact time we were told our table was ready we were told that they didn't have our reservation. After speaking to a manager we still waited 40 more minutes before they got us a table. Also note we were only a party of 5. Then we had a great server who was clearly overwhelmed as there was no way she could give us attention. It took extra time for everything. She struggled to get to our table to even take our order. All in all from start to finish dinner took over 3 hours. I would avoid this restaurant until the owner and managers fix their staffing problem."}
{"text":"Whenever my husband and I come here we ONLY sit in the bar. Idk why, but whenever we sit outside the bar at ANY restaurant, we get treated horribly. I think it's cause we look like we're teens(or so we're told) but I mention this because I want to praise your bartenders. We've experienced a few of them, and they all treated us great. I feel horrible because I forget their names. But next time I come in I plan on calling over a manager to make sure they know how great their bartender is(unless for some reason we start getting bad service,lol)"}
{"text":"Standard casual dining.   Chili's is your basic casual dining chain restaurant. The menu sports typical American items like burgers, steaks, and salads but they also offer some interesting takes on the standard fare.   I ordered the beef enchiladas which comes with rice and black beans while my friend ordered the bleu cheese chicken crispers with corn and loaded mashed potatoes. We also ordered chips and salsa for an appetizer. I know chips and salsa may sound rather boring but their chips are always great; they're on the thinner side and always arrive at the table warm. Paired with their skillet queso (which we skipped on this particular trip) there's no beating them!  Our food arrived quickly and was hot. While we both enjoyed our meals, my friend said that his corn on the cob tasted off, almost sour.  One thing that I'm not a fan of at Chili's is their method of payment which involves the little doohickey tablet thing at the table. Our server was great, both quick and friendly, but this payment method that more and more restaurants are adopting just irks me."}
{"text":"I wanted to write this sooner in your guest survey but since I have a very hectic work schedule and you only allow 4 days to put in the survey, I now must use this. I feel that this was the worst visit I've ever experienced at any of your Chili's locations in my life. I'm 23 years old and work very hard for the money I get, on top of going to college full time for further my career and live on my own. For me to go out to dinner, it's rare but since I used to work in the restaurant industry, I expect good service and understand what is required from a server. The service I received at the West Mifflin Chili's was horrible. The hostess seemed annoyed that we were coming in TWO hours before closing. I requested a booth, she gave me an attitude and said \"fine.\" No smile, no professionalism, and no manners. I then get seated where there's only one other two top seated, didnt get greeted for 7 minutes after being sat. It took us about 45 minutes to get our food that had been clearly sitting under the heat light for atleast 10 minutes in the kitchen. He did not come back once to check on us after getting the food. His name is Geo. Worst service ever. Horrible server that did not care."}
{"text":"Friendly greeter although we went to the bar. Friendly bartender was quick to take our order. Had the steak, shrimp and chicken fajitas come sizzling to the bar. Great food and service I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here on our last day in Vegas.  It was Sunday, wasn't crowded at all yet the service was poor and slow. Took forever to get a drink. Had 2 people take our drink order before it was even brought to us. I had a classic margarita (in a mug and super strong) my boyfriend got a beer that was barely even cold. Food was good, however when we received the bill and inquired about why we didn't get happy hour prices (happy hour all day Sunday) our waiter said that it was only at the bar and outside and we were never told that upon being seated. Really unorganized and lacking customer service skills. Hopefully with time it can improve. Until then I will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"This place is turning into a rip off!  Ordered the fajitas and it was $15.  It came out and it probably had about $2 in meat.  Then they didn't bring out the toppings for an extra 10 minutes.  Talk about poor service and food that is way over priced.  Even the portions of the appetizers have shrunk in half.  Save your money and eat at home or go somewhere else.  Personally I am never going back after this!"}
{"text":"I go at least once a month and don't recall a bad meal. Their fajitas and enchiladas are great. Their desserts are the best."}
{"text":"It's a Chili's... A chain restaurant that serves comfort Mexican-American food.  Chips and salsa are always good. However the other food is hit or miss.  As with most appetizers in this kind of restaurant... There Fryden heavy. Everything feels a bit fattening  They definitely need some healthier options"}
{"text":"A group from work went to Chili's for my Birthday lunch. Given we only had an hour for lunch, the staff was extremely quick and accurate. There were 12 of us and they were even so kind to give us all 12 separate checks. Ive been to plenty of places that will sigh and reluctantly split the checks. It gets annoying. The food was great. Im a huge fan of their new 10 items under $7.00 menu. It is really is the perfect portion for the perfect price. I ordered the Sweet Chili Chicken Crispers with fries. AMAZING. The whole table also ordered Bottomless Chips and Salsa....I LOVE their chips and salsa, the chips are thin and lightly salted, while the salsa is cool and refreshing. Not too spicy. The nice thing was that only one of the people that were with us ordered the bottomless lunch that includes the chips, and they brought out 3 bowls, and didnt charge us for 1. I will definitely go back again and again. Read my other review on the Chili's in Niagara Falls....not the best experience."}
{"text":"Leery of all Chili s after a horrible experience at their Montrose location but had gift certs to use.   First impressions:  Music is too loud.   Waited is pushy. We're here to relax but are being rushed. Why? It's not like there's a line waiting for our table.  Nothing in the menu is stellar. Hate that avocado is on nearly every dish.   Entree is small but sides are huge to make the plate appear full.   Not a chain we will patronize in the future. Just not laid back enough for us."}
{"text":"This Chili's is always clean but the service can be pretty slow....we had to constantly keep flagging down (trying to) our waiter...  This one waiter after our main waiter already introduced himself came over and said he will be helping the other guy but when we called on him for help he said he'll call the other guy...well then why the hell did you say you're both tag teaming us when clearly you are not????  O.K. now to the food:   -Fried Onions & Jalepenos: Wasn't sure if I was gonna enjoy the jalepenos but I did- I did eat a few that were too hot but it's a risk you take, I felt bad after eating this as I saw hella oil at the bottom- my heart was clogged even before I really began... -Fried Shrimp,Cole Slaw & Plain Mashed Potatoes: Pretty good, the shrimp were fat & plump- I would order this again... -Barbecue Ribs & Salt and Pepper Mashed Potatoes: The BF liked it- I took a bite- The ribs were soft- ordered extra barbecue sauce... -Chicken Strips,French Fries & Corn on the Cob: The kid loved her chicken strips- she said this is the best chicken strips she's ever had(I would consider her a chicken strip specialist-that's all she orders anywhere!!!) The breading here for the chicken is alot different than at other places and when you bite into a chicken strip it's so juicy and yummy- I liked the corn on the cob as well... MANGO ICED TEA MANGO ICED TEA MANGO ICED TEA!!!!! Mango Iced Tea + extra mango syrup & lemon = Beverage Perfection *They never hesitate to bring me one to take home*"}
{"text":"A friend told me about this \"hole in the wall\" called the Chili's. Was wondering if it's a Mexican restaurant. Never heard of it before. Felt like it would be a really relevant eatery and so I went.  Sort of cool how this place cultivates an ironic mainstream atmosphere. Feel like it would be a place where I would hang out with my high school friends if I lived in a suburb and not a \"mid-sized farming community.\" Fun to hear mainstream music and eat really fancy, alternative food masquerading as regular burgers and fries [via McDonald's]. Sort of refreshing to have the hostess ironically saying, \"Hey y'all, welcome to the Chili's\" instead of some bro in a taco cart saying, \"Hey bro, welcome to the Taco Cart.\"  Ordered a burger. Felt like it was pretty good. And I also enjoyed the Bottomless Chips & Salsa. The salsa tasted like cilantro Sort of like salsa I may get at a \"hole in the wall taqueria\" that is actually a hole in the wall. Feel like the owners of the Chili's are brilliant since it's not very often we can eat fine food in an ironic setting.  Was surprised that the ironic experience of eating at the Chili's even went down to the service. Always frustrated that when I eat at a relevant restaurant, it takes like 3 hours to cook some enchiladas. Felt like this was good that I could get quality food in like 20 minutes.  Reading the other reviews of relevant Yelpers and feel like they aren't really appreciating the ironic qualities that the Chili's provides. Feel like they're pretty entry level but as long as they're enjoying the food, it must be enough."}
{"text":"Our server was nice, but when you make three mistakes in one sitting apologies get old. A manager wasn't sent neither was anything comped off our meals. Now, I know this isn't fine dining, but even McDonald's has better service. I own a business and this would not fly. Pablo, you only had 2 tables in your section. I could do that with my eyes closed. There is no reason for you to make 3 mistakes in one sitting. The food was extremely salty as well. Never again."}
{"text":"Best customer service ever! They were almost closing, but still accommodated me. They were so nice and definitely care for their customers. Will 100% come back."}
{"text":"Both service and food were lacking. The chicken crispers were not even fast food quality, the service was slow and unresponsive. Had to send food back and no concern was given by server as to whether the second attempt was any better. Will not be returning to this location or most likely any other."}
{"text":"I like Chili's alright. I guess its a middle of the road type chain restaurant but they have some good things going for them. The chips and salsa are good. I like the all you can eat lunch (soup, salad, chips and salsa). And I like their fajitas. Which is exactly what I came in for on Monday. Especially now that the fajitas have \"48% more meat\" for $10.99. I was confused at first. The menu shows prices starting at $14.99. But there was a sticker on the back showing the better price. Much better.   I got my fajitas and they were fine. They came out hot and the meats (chicken and beef) were tender. I would have liked more peppers and fewer onions. I would have liked a lot less onion skin. I found at least two pieces of onion skin. No bueno. Other than that, they were mostly good amd filling.   My biggest complaint for this visit to the revamped Chili's was with the service. Yes, it was friendly. Yes, my food came out fairly quickly. But when I was first seated it took so long to even have my drink order taken. I saw a couple of staff walk past me and one nerdy host flirting with the girl seated near the host podium. I was getting irritated and was close to walking out when my server finally popped in to apologize for the delay and to tell me she would be right back. I respect that but it still bothered me to have to wait that long."}
{"text":"A lot has changed with chili's and it's awesome! It's been years since we have been here and to be honest the only reason we came is because we had a gift card. This was such a great experience we are already planning on returning for lunch in the next couple of weeks. Staff are friendly and very well organized. They all worked together to create a great experience for their customers. We had a fantastic experience from start to finish. They have a new coupon where you can get an order of free chips and salsa or a soda every time you visit . The chips were so yummy! Thin, crispy and warm. The salsa was ok (think standard jar salsa) my husband and I both got the chicken fajitas which were fantastic and the portion size was perfect. All 3 kids ordered off their kids menu and everyone was happy with their choice . I think next visit we will try out different apps and burgers ! Way to go chili's"}
{"text":"I like Chili's.  It is not my favorite place to eat but honeslty, I've never really had a bad experience.  Especially at this location.  I've come in a few times with family and once or twice with my roommates family.  Service has always been great.  The food is usally good.  The burgers are tasty.  The sandwiches are alright.  And they make a good margarita.  But it is the fajitas where they shine.  I used to get the the fajita trip with chicken, steak and shrimp until I devoloped my shell fish allergy.  Now I go with the steak fajitas.  They are delicious.  Perfectly grilled and tender steak still slightly red in the middle just the way I like it.  No shortage of perfectly grilled onion and peppers.  I like mine served Cadillac Style with black beans and rice on the side.  My only complaint is that there were not enough tortillas.  I could have used another one or two.  Though I guess that just means there was a lot by way of fajita fillings.  Fillings that I have no problem eating via fork-to-mouth method rather than in the traditional tortilla delivery system.  If the food and service is not enough, I usually see a balloon artist roaming the restaurant and making some awesome sculptures upon request from all the kids.  Chili's, a family place."}
{"text":"This location is always great. Great service and great food. I love that they have the little kiosks at the table so you don't have to wait for your check. You just pay and leave. Super nice and genius of them to include games for the kids for $1. I'd pay the dollar just to keep my kids quiet. Nice location."}
{"text":"I tried this location of Chili's the other night and as a typical Chili's usually is, it was just okay. I had a coupon for a free appetizer so we opted for the new soft pretzels with cheese dip. The pretzel's themselves were pretty good but the cheese dip was not very good. The cheese seemed lumpy and heated from a can - Yuck. I would not order these again.  For dinner I had the new pizza that Chili's now offers. I had it with pepperoni and jalapeno's. It was actually pretty good. It is a pan style pizza this is brought out with it's own stand. I might get one again. My fiancé had the big mouth burger sliders which he thought were good. The fries he had were quite greasy on this visit. The service was good. I had ordered blackberry iced tea at the beginning of the meal and our waitress told me that they were running out of blackberry flavor so she brought me the rest that they had, I thought that was really great and going above and beyond.  Overall this location of Chili's is not bad. It definitely is not my favorite food but I might be back on occasion."}
{"text":"Ah Chili's you are always so mediocre through and through... I haven't been to this location in over a year. It hasn't changed much. The appearance of the interior maybe a little, the menu has had a few tweaks but overall it is still the same old mediocre burgers, steaks and for some reason now pizza. Tonight I had an oldtimer burger and asked for it cooked medium well, it was crispy as could be when I got it and lacking the flavor department. My fiancé's big mouth bite sliders were decent. Fries were lukewarm and semisoft. Service was pretty good.   Overall if you are looking for a quick bite and a decent happy hour, stop here but don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"They burnt my food they over cooked I mean dang I was wanting it all day wait over 20 minutes to take it home and yall burnt it and then tells me to wait for something in the mail I paid yall in person why w Should I wait"}
{"text":"THE service was excellent. My waitress was great she check on a regular. The restaurant was very clean, I will glade be back very soon"}
{"text":"Great food as with most Chilis restaurants. Since the reward system wasn't working for me and I was here three times without getting credit, the manager took care of all the food. So first class service!!"}
{"text":"**late review**  Meh, not great. Service was not the best. Good was ok! What I am mat upset about is our alcoholic drink... Let me just tell you a lil something about me real quick.... I'm a cheap date, lol it doesn't take me but a few sips of anything alcoholic to feel buzzed or drunk lmao! The drink we ordered either had a thimble full or none in it. I not only couldn't taste any, but never got me two sip buzz. I drank the whole almost $9 drink and nothing. Super disappointed guys!! Again other than that it was a basic experience."}
{"text":"Management needs to review customers feedback and address issues accordingly. We have been coming to this Chili's for years. The food has been hit or miss the last several times and I always leave feedback on the kiosk When we pay our bill. Food portions shrinking and being served lukewarm. Floors dirty and Very few staff members smile. I never see a manager walking the floor checking on customers like at other local restaurants.  We will try again in a few months"}
{"text":"Eat here on Friday night about 7:00. First they where out of standard baby back ribs. I think that was ridiculous. Very poor planning on management part. Then the floor was filthy. When brought to managements attention I was told it was due to the type of flooring they had. The hamburger I finally settled on was very good."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience here.  Apparently chile's does not understand the purpose of menus. They do not list ANY prices on their drink menu. Even more infuriating, when I asked if it was happy hour, I was told it was and that drinks were all $1.50 to $2.00 off. Unfortunately I still had no idea what the prices were. The waitress has apparently heard this complaint before but instead of referencing a price for premium vs house or domestic vs import I was told this was \"corporate's\" policy and that I was welcome to fill out the survey form after my meal. Well Chili's corporate, I decline your invitation to fill out paperwork. I simply did not order anything and will not be coming back to Chili's ever. I hope u get this feedback.  -1 customer for life!"}
{"text":"Usually I'm a huge fan of Chili's... Tonight is a big exception.  The order was messed up and it took over 20 minutes for a ham (supposed to be turkey) sandwich.  That means service and food were bad... I'll be back because I love Chili's but tonight is was very disappointing.  I should add, they comped my sandwich, as I only had the first few bites.  Chili's can be so much better!!"}
{"text":"It's a Chili's Too - I wasn't expecting much.  We were sat in the bar quickly and our waitress was friendly and efficient.  The food met my expectations."}
{"text":"This Chillis is above average.  The wait staff is average but the food always taste great.  This is a go to place to meet with friends and family for a meal out.    I noticed they don't refill drinks unless specifically ask the waiter, and food can take a while to get to your table.  So I learned it's best to actively hound the waiter about food and drinks.  They are really busy so it might be that they have too many tables and are understaffed.  If they were a bit quicker it would be a 5 star review."}
{"text":"My most recent experience at Chilis was not great. Numerous things were just not going right such as their online ordering. It never works! After completing the order it always says something went wrong and to just call. Well great you just wasted 10 min of our day! So then my husband calls to make our order for pickup. He called around noon and tells them the order is for 4:30 so that we can pick it up when I get done with work.   I show up at 4:30. The guy at the to go counter seems completely confused. Maybe he was high as it was 4:20? Anyway I tell him I'm here to pick up my order. He asked for my name and phone number. I tell him. Then he says \" so what do you want\"?! I'm pretty sure the look on my face was utter shock... I tell him my food? Now he is really confused which is fascinating since this is a restaurant.... eventually he says oh ok here is your food. Which is sitting in a bag right beside him.   I get home and we sit down to eat. 1/2 the food was missing and the rest is as cold as could be. My chicken literally is as cold as a refrigerator. I'm assuming they cooked the food when we ordered it and then just stuck it in the fridge... I didn't even bother caller because I'm sure the dude would have been even more confused or high or whatever kids these days do. I'm done chilis. Hire better employees and maybe do drug tests?"}
{"text":"Great dining experience. All of the food looked as pictured and the taste was excellent. I highly recommend the buffalo strips and the cheese poppers.  The Tito's mixed drink was amazing as well !!"}
{"text":"The service was a little slow for a place thst wasn't  busy but the food was great.  We ordered the 2 for 22$. It was a great deal.  We ordered two fajitas entrees and shared one and took one home for smother meal.  There was a lot of good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so dirty. I noticed it the min I walked in. The tables were filled with garbage and the floors were so filled with trash. Then we were seated and I went to wash my hands and had to walk by the kitchen and OMG it was a disaster!!!! Tortilla chips all over the floor and food all over the counter tops. I honestly am calling the manager tomorrow and I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Average food of course its chili but Sean the bar tender was rather snobby. I got to go and got a drink while waiting. He a answered my questions and got my drink quickly also allowed me to pay for my order there at the bar. But he was just a snob. Not worth the tip. I should have just got my average food and went home."}
{"text":"This is for a to-go order.  I hope for Chili's sake that the dine-in experience is better, but after this experience, I don't think I'm willing to find out. I ordered a grilled chicken on black beans, rice and pico de gallo with crispy tortilla strips from the \"lighter choices\" menu.  Here's what I actually received for $10.79:  A cold, dried out piece of chicken breast atop crispy tortilla strips.  No beans.  No rice.  No pico de gallo.  What the hell?  We also ordered the California Grilled Chicken Flatbread appetizer.  This was cold and chewy versus hot (I even would've been happy with warm) and crispy.  All of the food was cold, and we only live five minutes away.  If you should decide to risk placing and paying for a to-go order at Chili's, make sure you open all the containers before you leave."}
{"text":"When I'm in town, I often come for a quick bite. Staff is always nice, knowledgeable, and friendly. I always get a smiling hello on the walk-in and seated fast.  Food is always hot when it's brought out Drink specials are prepared properly and are actually strong. You have to order whatever the Chili's pick is though. Other drinks are probably good, but they make the special for the month, extra special!!  Keep up the good work guys!! I always tell the manager how well everything always is. I think the compliments keep up the outstanding service."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. My boyfriend and I came to Charlotte for the panthers christmas eve game. Nothing was really open after the game (because obviously things close early on christmas eve), and this was out first time in charlotte, so we decided to go to this chilli's before heading to our hotel. IT WAS HORRIBLE. We waited about 30 minutes to be seated. Then we waited another 20 minutes before a server even came to get our drink orders and had we known the area we wouldve just left from the go. He claimed he overlooked us somehow, however he bumped into my chair several times. Anyway, this turned out to be the worst waiter we've EVER had anywhere. He didn't refill our drinks at all, gave us no napkins, nothing. The only thing he did was take our orders. When the food came it was horrible and burned. We didn't even eat and be honest we shouldn't have paid at all. Save yourself the trouble of coming to this shithole."}
{"text":"We have tried this location many times.  Even with half the restaurant empty you will wait a long time for a table. Even if the bar is empty they won't let you sit there. I really don't understand why they turn away business. Rarely does the food ever come out without problems. We have sent cold food back several times only to have it come out cold a second time. Service always acts as if they are too overworked.   Not one time out of 10 did things go smoothly. I guess I'm the sucker who keeps trying it."}
{"text":"Terrible service! We stood at the door for at LEAST 5 minutes waiting to be greeted while the hostess flirted at the bar. Te restaurant was dirty, the lemonade tasted like soap. It took forty minutes on a slow Saturday to get our food and then my moms was wrong(but hot) mine was cold and hard(quesadilla) and my dads shrimp tacos were rubbery(shrimp). They offered to remake my moms food, but we didn't have the time to wait, they DID take it off the bill, but we never saw a manager....isn't that standard restaurant protocol to send a manger over to tables to better mistakes?"}
{"text":"I wanna like this place, but service is so horrible.  Never a manager in sight either.  Waitress forgot appetizer, forgot to bring wine, i actually went to ar and picked up myself and glass was dirty.  Been several times and lways the same.  Chilis no more."}
{"text":"So unusual for 5 star review on Chili's, but this one earned it.  Food was consistent with any other Chili's - it's the service that made the difference.  Total bill 35 dollars and change, left 10 dollar tip - they work hard, care about their customer, are efficient and genuinely nice.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Alright food, great service.  Sit in the bar area. I went for lunch to waste time while waiting at the DMV.  I had the turkey sandwich.  It wasn't the best turkey sandwich I had but it was good enough to hold me over until I got home.  The blackberry tea though was amazing!"}
{"text":"Chili's is a chain restaurant, so I guess if you've been to one, then you've been to them all. The menus and the décor are about the same. The waitress we had was busy, but she was pleasant and checked on us frequently. However, it was a different waitress who brought us the food- the WRONG FOOD. Those types of mistakes happen from time to time, so I won't hold it against anyone. The food was okay, although the \"loaded\" mashed potatoes weren't loaded enough; there needs to be more cheese and more bacon. Overall, A-OK."}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable lunch here. The customer service & hospitality was excellent. Service was so fast, from being seated to being waited on, to food coming out fast, even the checking out process went so quick & smoothly using the automated machines. We were very impressed as we were on the road, heading back to Phoenix & didn't want to stop for too long. The food was excellent...chicken enchiladas & chicken ranchero tacos. Chili's is never disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge frequenter of chain restaurants, but this Chili's is by my house and I can order takeout online and walk to pick it up, so sometimes the convenience lures me in.  Every time I order something for take out here, I have a bad experience. I don't know why I keep going back. A couple of months ago I got sick after eating some enchilada soup that I picked up from here. A few weeks ago I ordered their crispy chicken crispers meal, and they tasted like burnt grease and rubber. Seriously the WORST chicken I've ever had anywhere, and I've eaten chicken tenders from gas stations before (yeah, I'm not proud of that, but I'm willing to share that embarrassing fact with you just to drive home how horrible this chicken was!)  And just the other night I ordered a creamy cajun chicken pasta dish. The pasta was hard and dry, there was about a tablespoon of sauce in the whole dish, and there was no cajun flavor, despite it being in the name! I ate two bites and threw the rest away. I'm not one who usually wastes food, but it was truly terrible. I don't know if their food is this bad when you dine in, but I am DONE with takeout food here.   I don't give out one star reviews often, but the to-go food from this particular Chili's is definitely worthy of this dubious honor!"}
{"text":"Two and a half stars really. This place was filthy. We should not have eaten here. What we could see was filthy, so who knows what the kitchen looked like. Well, actually on the way to the bathroom, I could see the kitchen. Someone had dumped tortilla chips on the floor and just left them. Ugh.   We arrived on Sunday around 2pm. There were so many tables that needed to be bussed. Maybe they were short staffed? It seemed as though there were enough people working, and someone could have stepped in to clear some tables.   Anyway, we split a Bacon Avocado Chicken sandwich for lunch. It is skinless boneless chicken, with provolone, sauteed onions, spring mix, tomato, cilantro pesto mayo all on a toasted pretzel bun. I didn't realize that it was on a pretzel bun, and this was my first time trying one. It was actually really flavorful, and soft. The chicken was very moist, and the spring mix was a nice change from iceburg lettuce. I am not a huge fan of cilantro, but this was fairly mild and the whole combination tasted good.   For dessert we again split a dish, and got the Skillet Toffee Fudge Brownie. This came out in a small cast iron skillet. The brownie was hot, the vanilla ice cream was nice and cold, and there were bits of toffee and some caramel drizzled on top. I liked it a lot more than my husband did. It was good, but it was more sugary sweet than it was rich and cholatey, if that makes sense.   When we first sat down, I noticed the computer screen at the table and thought 'oh no, I will have to work to figure out how to place my order using this screen'. Not the case. Our waiter took our order. The waiter did come by to give us our check as well, and he put it onto this table top computer. This allowed us to see everything on the screen, it even gave us the opportunity to split the check if we needed to do so. It offered a suggested tip, with a sliding scale to change the amount to your preference. This part was really easy. At the end, it printed out a receipt as well. The screen itself though...dirty. Ugh.   We have not been to Chili's in awhile, and after this visit we most likely will not be back any time soon."}
{"text":"We had the worst service that you could imagine. There were four couples of us that went to Chili's for a birthday celebration. We did the call ahead seating because of the group size. When we got there they admitted that they had received the call but forgot to put us on the list. We waited an hour to be seated. Then we ordered our meals and waited another hour for the food to be served. One meal was so cold that it was sent back. Another person ordered tortilla soup and it came without a spoon and there were no spoons in their silly paper bag that they put the silverware in. It took two requests for the spoon to be delivered. We ordered drinks and all were delivered except for one. it took 15 minutes to get it. The food was good which is the only thing good that I can say about our experience. Each couple was billed separately and the bills were messed up. That can be expected with four bills at one table so we corrected the waitress on each bill. The bills came back and we were billed for two drinks that we did not order or receive and for two hamburgers when only one was ordered. To make this long story shorter, one couple had their bill done correctly after sending it back once, another send theirs back twice, another sent it back 3 times and the last sent it back 4 times! before it was correct. We talked to the manager twice and he was useless. We didn't want any perks or free meals - just correct bills covering the food that was ordered and served. Needless to say, this restaurant lost four customers."}
{"text":"The service at this location was pretty fast. The services was nice and he always stopped by the table to make sure we r OK. This place was packed but we got in pretty fast. The food was good and we got dessert, yummy."}
{"text":"Well, where do I start.  I came with my son, his girlfriend and his friend. We sat in the bar area and waited 10  min till a Manager came and said he was only coming to get our drink order, he had been making his rounds to the few customers that were here. Harassed my son about his drivers license being horizontal,  (AZ law changed about a year ago requesting for CA  people to get new ID's) got our margaritas which mine tasted like Mango Juice from the Jumex Juice Box! Some One else  took our order, bar started to get a couple more people, no one came around to see how we were doing, where others were checked on constantly. Food finally came, good thing that was not messed up. We requested a ranch dressing and as I write this we are still waiting for it. Other customers, have gotten thier extras whatevers they requested. Still trying to figure out who is our Server!! Very disappointed with this Chili's."}
{"text":"Not much to really write. They are consistent. My kids love eating there. I love the chicken crispers. The waitress there remembers us and our orders, which is funny considering most waiters at restaurants can't even get an order right. I love the self check out on the tables, so i never have to ask for the check. Glad that technology is coming to phx finally. They also have games to keep the kids busy. Never have had bad service. Sorry but there isn't anything bad to write about this place."}
{"text":"Ribs were awesome but the service was the worst I  have ever experienced. 3 people in my group only got half of their meals (2 people missing sides 1 person got their side but not the steak) 2 of us didnt get our food for 10 min after the rest. One of my sides was ice cold...they never heated it up. Stay away from this place at all cost, not worth spending your hard earned money here when you can go many other places....ohh yea when we asked to speak to the manager he/she sent out a server and we were told that the manager was to busy to come out and address the problems."}
{"text":"As long as you get your regular server this place is awesome. Sign up for their app. Great savings and discounts."}
{"text":"We were in the area and thought to stop at this chili's location for dinner, we usually go to another location.  The service was super SLOW. The waitress wouldn't come and check on us and at least apologize for the food taking so long. Finally got our food about 45 minutes later.  I got the baby back ribs and they were so dry. My daughter got a medium well steak that wasn't cooked correctly and my bf got soggy chicken crispers. The waitress never came by to ask how our food was, she probably knew our answer. I got the managers attention and let her know of our situation and she took a whole 8 dollars off...yay. I ended up paying 35 for a terrible dinner that we didn't enjoy. They didn't give us a receipt, probably didn't want us to do the survey. We will never go to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Something about this location - it's just better than the others!! Ask for Keith as your server - we have been lucky to have him twice and he is fantastic!! Great customer service - he is awesome!!"}
{"text":"I walked in and ordered a burger and two kids burger to go. I was told 20 min but after 1 hr I was able to get my food. During the long wait I could witness how dirty and disgusting was the kitchen. The servers were taking orders, manipulating money and then preparing food without any sanitation. One of the servers decided to lick her fingers while preparing a dessert and then touched the food again. I threw my food in the garbage when I got home and will NEVER EVER go back to this location."}
{"text":"They are so rude and racist, I have been waiting over 30 mins meanwhile they let people who came after us go ahead of us and I had to catch a movie at 8 pm . We got there at 6:10 and we didn't get a table till 6:45!!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Chili's in a long time. The staff said they recently simplified their menu to focus on barbecue, burgers and fajitas.  We ordered their cluck crispers, which come in 5 flavors. They had a 2 for $22 special, which came with appetizers and entree. We selected side salads.  We also got fries and corn on the cob.   Great meal, great service and a decent price."}
{"text":"Plenty of room for improvement. Ordered a beer, queso and table side guacamole. Stay away from what they call queso. Scorched, Watery no cheese or meat---mess. Nothing even similar to queso and taste more like canned chili water. Beer was good!!!Will not return."}
{"text":"My fiancé and i ordered the exact same thing except she wanted ranch on the side and i wanted ranch on my sandwich and i got just a tiny little splash of ranch  about a thimble full yup ill keep going to Applebees across the street"}
{"text":"Poor seating staff... Showed me where to sit... But no menu. Finally ordered drink and food... Got the drink, but food is (still) taking forever. It's just a flatbread app..."}
{"text":"I go to this Chili's twice a week.. love love the staff! Absolutely make you feel welcome.. Melissa rocks! Social,kind and so enthusiastic about her work.. Andrew,Erin and Jeanine are also wonderful!! Amy the manager always says hello with a great smile.. and has  great relationship with her staff.. Food is always cooked exactly as I ask.. Thanks again for the many great experiences!"}
{"text":"Wow. What a horrible decision it was to come and grab a quick bite here.   When we arrived we were immediately sat and the hostess was very personable. The GM came by and said our server would be right with us and offered to take a beverage order.   Around 5 or so minutes pass by and our server arrives with our beverages and asked if we would like to order an appetizer or our meal. We decided on the triple dipper and we went ahead and ordered it. This is were it all fell apart. We waited 15 minutes for our appetizer... And it comes out with Luke warm cheese bites, soft egg rolls (they felt like they were just microwaved) and over fried pickles. We munched and just ate what we had because we were starving and at least we still had dinner coming. Once dinner arrived we knew we had made a terrible mistake. We had 2 orders of the shrimp tacos, and a ribeye ordered medium. The shrimp on the tacos were bone cold and the fries were not even warm, and the steak was cooked well done. I flagged our server down just to explain the situation and get a re-cook and she exclaims \"Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I'll go get this fixed and I'll comp your food.\" And then she proceeded to leave the steak on the table... I had to flag someone else down to get the ribeye. The food was recooked and returned, and it was honestly no better but at that point it was better than nothing. The GM came to the table again with some $5 gift cards and told us \"We've just got a lot going on back there\" and said he'd hope we would return. Then our server brings our bill, needless to say the food was not comped. They took a measly amount off of our bill. Now I wasn't asking for a free meal but if your server says it will be comped it should have been comped. It also wasn't professional for the GM to state \"They have a lot going on back there\" ... hello welcome to the food service industry on a Saturday night. Do yourself a favor don't darken their doorstep."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was comfortable; it's a place to bring the family. Isn't that what these chains are for anyways? You can be anywhere in the US and find a location; the only difference would be the local staff.  I was not entirely satisfied with the quality of food. The broccoli was dry, bland and flavorless. The mash potatoes tasted like instant potatoes that you buy at the bottom of the isle in your local grocery store.   The Salmon had flavor and a pan-seared crisp to it. Though I did find a tiny bone, not much else to say for that, you'd be better off with a burger. Salmon was a mistake.  The chips, salsa and guac honesty, was the best item ordered. I recommend if you're looking for an appetizer.   What was with those table iPads? Completely useless. They never described the purpose; it sat there taking up a huge part of the table, and we never used it. Maybe if the entire menu was viewable?   Overall, can't say that I would recommend this place given the hundreds of other drivable restaurants in the area. So I give this place a merely two stars due to it's sub-par cookie-cutter quality."}
{"text":"The service is always so when I go . I think the servers need to focus more on their guest during lunch hours versus going to the back kitchen"}
{"text":"My review will be about the to-go service, but every time we have gone to this location, we tell ourselves we will never come back again. We would rather drive to the Chili's in the Superstition area even though it's further away for better service. Last night, I called this location to order for pick-up. I called and was immediately placed on hold for about 6 minutes. I hung up and called again and the girl who answered took my order of honey chipotle crispers. Pretty easy order to fulfill. I get there at the estimated 15 minutes the girl told me over the phone, paid right when I walked in the door, and was told my order will be ready in a few minutes. As I was standing there waiting, I noticed there were a few different bags of food ready to be picked up. One looked like one entree, which is all I ordered, but I thought to myself, \"the girl said my order will be ready in a few minutes... So that couldn't possibly be my order. She can't be THAT oblivious...\" About 10 minutes goes by, I see a blonde manager walk by casually without asking if I had been helped, and I see people coming and going with the food they picked up. I finally start to doubt the to-Go girl that helped me, so I ask someone working alongside her if that bag of food is for me. She checks it and reads off my name, hands it to me without saying anything, and I am left feeling completely infuriated and shocked that my food was sitting there, READY FOR ME TO TAKE WHEN I GOT THERE, but THE COMPLETE DISORGANIZATION AND UNPROFESSIONALISM OF THE EMPLOYEES AT THE TO-GO AREA CAUSED ME TO HAVE TO LEAVE WITH COLD FOOD. I was tempted to shove it back in there faces and ask them to make me another order that ISN'T cold, but then I would've been sitting there for who knows how long while my son and my husband are waiting for me in the car.  I will never go back to this Chili's ever again. Every single employee there needs a crash course on customer service and a restaurant workplace in general. I hope someone from this location and corporate reads this."}
{"text":"This Chili's has fallen off. Some friends and I went here for dinner last night and were disappointed. The food came out late and it was cold. I ordered a half rack of ribs and loaded mash. The cheese wasn't melted which was the first sign that my food was cold. We had to keep asking for items that were supposed to be with the food when it came to the table. The waiter didn't give us any silverware we had to wait about 5-6 mins until another waiter walked by to get it. Don't get me started on the women's restroom which was disgusting!!! This used to be my favorite location, but I think I'll go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"The service was very attentive and courteous..... however..... the food was substandard. They have a new menu, which we didn't really care for, having been regular customers of Chili's for at least 10 years. We went for the \"2 for 22.00\" special. I had the chicken and pasta dish. My lunch guest had the small grilled steak. The salads were standard house salad with ordinary iceberg lettuce and a few spring greens. The ranch dressing was nicely seasoned ... however, the croutons were WAY over-baked, dry, and resembled cardboard in taste and texture. The chicken was rubbery and under-grilled. The pasta was a pile of over-cooked tubes covered in pale yellow \"cheese-sauce\" that had the consistancy of Elmer's glue. Kraft macaroni and cheese has this stuff beat by a mile. My friend's steak was more than 50 percent gristle and fat and he couldn't even cut through it. The broccholi was crunchy, though the mashed potatoes were fine. When our server came back and gathered our plates, she looked surprised to see how little we ate and asked if we wanted \"doggie bags\" and I said \"absolutely NOT!\" and she only smiled and said \"I understand.\" She quicly brought us our check without asking if we enjoyed any part of the meal. I think she may have read our minds and left the subject alone. So sad they took off a lovely grilled salmon from the menu, as well as a pasta and grilled chicken dish, which was beautifully prepared. After this visit, we have crossed Chili's off of our regular restaurant picks. Such a shame."}
{"text":"I just got Postmates delivered from this Chilli's and I ordered the Sunrise Burger, and it was seriously the best thing I've eaten in awhile. My sincerest compliments to the chef, that burger was phenomenal. It was so juicy and delicious and an awesome price. 10/10 would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"The two stars are for my  waitress - which I quickly noticed took orders and busted tables. Shame on Chili's policy that works their wait staff like slaves. Poor lady was nice and very helpful explaining their happy hour vs regular menu. The food was delicious we had the happy hour menu with the 1/2 order of Texas fries, chicken pasta and bacon burger w/fries for $22.   The hostess gave us a choice of the bar or dining room seating . We decided to eat inside the bar with several televisions with every game playing.  Good food and drinks with a nice crowd. Then the rug was pulled out from under us.  This asshole dressed in black, maybe a bartender,  started turning  off the tv's with 2 seconds left on the SF gameWTF?!! He actually back-talked when the patrons asked what he was doing.   RUDE, RUDE,  RUDE.   There are sooo many other places nearby to eat.  The manager came out but so what if thats his after work buddy or relative or close friend.  Shame on them for over working the wait staff with no bus boys and having jackasses ruining the games by changing channels 2 seconds left  in the game."}
{"text":"Humpity, Humpity Henderson, went to go eat some food and beverage with a Ruthity, Ruthity awesome.  Here comes the waitress, golden locked with peppity, peppity spirit smiley, smiley all through the ordering, drinkity, drinkity with refills of strawberry, strawberry lemonade  for free! for free!! all with goodity, goodity, goodness of food (although I can't remember exactly what I ate)  most of the time chain restaurants are what I hate,  but now this time,  this little fishity, fishity... has taken the bait! SOLD!"}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone has to say about chained restaurants! Chilis is awesome! Once a month i come in to get my boneless wings and a side of southwestern mac and cheese with a blue moon draft, and finish off with a cookie and ice cream desert and I Love it!   Additionally, i get my chilis points and save them until i am able to get a free desert! That is right! I am also always checking my em-mail because they have some specials that I can not refuse!    Bottom line, I only eat here during happy hour and i recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here, and my review accounts the same rating for both times. Both times I've ordered the triple dipper, and the food itself is 3/5. The servers are also a 3/5. Would i recommend this place- no."}
{"text":"I normally like this place, but it wasn't busy and several people were waiting to be seated, we ordered apps and dinner it pretty much all came out at the same time we were at a 2 person table and the waitress didn't care we didn't have room cause we were still eating salads I had to stop eating to make room for the entrees she put the fajitas in front of me ( which the meat I ordered was incorrect) it burned me.. She took it back took the Chicken off brought it back as is and the steak came out separately when we were finished. She was nice but oblivious I won't be back for a while maybe they have bad management not sure but ya my arm is burned. I tipped her anyway but really bad experience."}
{"text":"They have good chips and guacamole!  Their 2 for 20 menu is very small.  Overall it was ok."}
{"text":"My experience today at chili's was pretty good.  I had steak with broccoli and mashed potatoes!  I like the garlic butter on the steak.  The dessert was delicious. I have gone to other chili's and this one is much better."}
{"text":"Chili's baby back ribs! The new chicken bowls and mango lemonade! Bar staff are great only ever sat their. New tablets are different! Not open late enough, maybe the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere to eat and saw online that they have an online ordering system and curb delivery. awesome!! once we got home and got our food out to eat right away. We ordered the cajun chicken pasta and the 6oz sirloin. The pasta was AMAZING!!! soooo good!! the steak.. not so much. We ordered it medium but when we cut it open it was most definitely rare and looked almost inedible. Definitely would eat here again but it wouldn't be my first choice for steak."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went out for our Sunday lunch and she asked for Chilis. Ok we have always loved it there. Walked in and was greeted very nice, and the waitress was at the table in no time. We ordered our drinks and appetizer. Got those in a timely manner. I ordered what I always get the chicken crisper with corn and fries and my daughter ordered the kids chicken dippers which we were told they were the same as the chicken crisper but in chunks, she ordered fries with that and I also ordered her a separate side of corn.   Our appetizer came in a timely manner but the handle of the pan they were in was nasty I took pics. Then when our food come I noticed how much the size of the chicken crispers had changed. They have always been very nicely portioned and these looked like someone took a chicken tender and cut it down the middle. The chicken dippers were. It as we were told. They are very \"crunchy\". On top of this when the food arrived she had no fries but corn and after a few minutes the waitress came back and said they were cooking her fries, this took so long that my daughter was no longer hungry by the time they arrived and was warned to be careful because they were hot. I truly appreciate the freshness of food when you are dealing with an 8 year old it is different and hard for them to wait on something. We wound up taking basically her whole order home with us.   The waitress was very very AMAZING!!! She did a wonderful job, her name was Kayle. We loved her and I could tell she was very in tune with my child and handling children she got down on my child's level and let her place her order and was very patient. I loved that.   Please let me know when you change the chicken crispers back to the size they used to brand clean the pot holder that they use to bring out the appetizers."}
{"text":"This Chili's location is always clean and the staff is helpful and friendly. Given a choice my children will almost always choose Chili's, they really like the children's menu and since the children's menu offers veggies and the drink is included with the meal the price is right!  Of couse Mom & Dad like the fresh salads and the fajita's!"}
{"text":"While we did have a large party on a friday night we expected the wait to be a bit long... but not 50 minutes... then it took forever to get our drinks. We got no crayons for the kids even after we asked. It took 30 mins to get the appetizers & salads... Im not sure if the waitress was just overwhelmed but we got only 1 refill and that wasnt until the manager came over with our dinners which was served to adults first then kids 5 minutes later... overall I think this was the worst experience we have ever had at a Chili's... the 2 stars is soley for the food, which was good ..."}
{"text":"Ordered Togo online. I sat in the Togo area for about 8 minutes with no acknowledgement from any staff. My order was supposed to be ready at 6pm and was not for 18 minutes later. Now, that may not seem that long, yet with no communication, eye contact, non-verbals or anything, to a guest that is a long time. As such, I am giving the service at this location a 2."}
{"text":"Just so happened to be in the area and stopped with family to eat here. I eat at Chili's often, but never this location. Saw on the advertising menu this lighter side/healthy choice 6oz steak with tomato salad. Dang was it good, i couldnt believe it...thats how good it was. Cooked to perfection and seasoned great. Will definitely get this again when i come to Chili's."}
{"text":"Service good, poured out my ranch dressing to find something mysterious in it - appeared to be a food item like a piece of crust of something. Told server took very light of it as did I having worked in the business. Meaning I wasn't trying to make a big deal out of it. But the thing that should've occurred was for the server to tell management and have them acknowledge the incident. I will most likely speak with a manager before I leave - then maybe not."}
{"text":"This is an update on my previous review, I felt like I needed to change it from 4 to 5 stars.  First off the hostess was wonderful, while I was alone in my party she treated me same as larger parties and she appeared great with all the kids coming in.    My server Jay, was excellent. Gave me all the specials, refilled my drinks, made sure dinner was good and even checked on me during coffee, where he made a fresh pot for me ( and I probably needed the coffee after trying the cherry blossom Margaritas... Really good btw).  I tried the 6oz avacado sirloin... Was amazing with cherry tomatoes that burst in your mouth and pieces of roasted garlic.  I also tried the street corn, where has that been all my life? It was amazing.  The manager was very visible and even going around to tables to make sure everyone was alright... Something I really like."}
{"text":"I was shocked to see this chili's only had a three star rating, I have loved this restaurant for years and even remember when it was built.  Anytime in the past that I had an issue and involved the manager it was fixed right away.  On today's visit I received the best service I have ever gotten at a chili's.  Logan was phenomenal. I cannot say enough about his performance or interaction with my son and myself. Chili's never fails to take me to my happy place."}
{"text":"First time at this Chili's, everything was great.  Clean restrooms, fast service, food was just as I ordered, price was reasonable amount as always their Margaritas are my favorite.  First time having coffee here for dessert and their coffee was surprisingly really really good."}
{"text":"Meh. It's a chain. I really hate how impersonal the dining experience has become. Sure the tablet like things are great to keep a 7 year old preoccupied, but it really cuts down on server communication.   We came for lunch, it didn't start out super busy but did begin to fill up fairly quickly. Our server greeted us quickly and got drunk orders. After returning and gathering our food orders he became a little scarce but we didn't require much. A bit slow on the drink refills was about it.   When the food arrived he realized there was cheese on one we requested without cheese. My fiancée requested only tomato and lettuce on his with a side or buffalo and his didn't arrive correct either. It took another 10-15 minutes to get the remade food items and he still did not get the tomato or sauce until he asked.   The server didn't return and we just paid using the tablet deal and left. Oh well. Thanks for the impersonator experience Chilis."}
{"text":"Started with slow service but improved and ended up excellent. Appetizer excellent - eggrolls Dinner poor chicken wrap Will go back for service"}
{"text":"Chili's...how do i hate thee, let me count the ways. I am only giving it 1 star since Yelp has no rating lower. If I could leave a negative 5 star rating I would.  I will start off by saying part of this is my fault for even going there. I am a foodie and I should have known never ever go to a chain restaurant, especially a mediocre one at best.  We went to the one near PV Mall in Phoenix, to start off we were a party if 4, we went for a family meal.  We put our name in and a group of 5 came in after us who was seated before us. Thats was a bit annoying, I should have taken that as a bad omen.  My wife ordered shrimp tacos, my son a black bean burger, my other son had mac and cheese, and I had a full slab of ribs.  It took over 40 minutes for us to get our food. Our server made stops by the table about once every 20 minutes, which was annoying.   When the food came out it was all bad. My ribs were over cooked, barely any meat on the bones, very little sauce. The corn on the cob was so mushy it had the conistency of creamed corn. It was crap. I remember in the past the ribs being OK, these were the worst.  The blackbean burger, they managed to screw the order up. They put raw onions on the burger that still had the skin on it. Very classy. They also brought the wrong sides out too.  The shrimp tacos are the most screwed up. They were supposed to have shrimp, spicy slaw, and avacado. 3 tacos. The first had tortilla and shrimp, the second had shrimp and slaw, the third one had it right, all the ingredients. But the shrimp was so overcooked and rubbery you could have used them as tennis balls.  The mac and cheese was ok though. I spent 59 dollars and got a complete crap meal. My wife and I were thinking during this splendid feast...\"why don't we come to Chilis more often...Oh yea, the food is complete #&*$. This food is what you would expect if you were serving time in prison... I should take that back, I am sure the inmates in the local prison would demand better food, and probably any prison cook would have had more self respect than to serve food this bad. If it sounds like I am being overly harsh it is because I dont want anyone else to throw their time or money away on this #&$*hole establishment."}
{"text":"Time to give up. Remember when Chili's had fresh Tex Mex & BBQ? We had a gift card (truly) brought some friends to use it. Had beers (yay) wings were ucky, chili was ucky, salad was passable. Service was slow, they have the table menus on the tablets. Which were fun to play with but you had to pay. Soup was okay (small bowl for the money). I think the bets use of Chili's is for families with annoying children to let them hop around in the booths. And eat chicken fingers. When I am not there, preferably."}
{"text":"I had a gift card, given by someone who does not know me (obviously), but it was expiring so I grabbed a friend and went to Chili's. They have done this place over and it looks really nice. But that does not change the averageness of the food. The service was fine, Beer was cold, Some people just like this place, there is so much nearby that needs to be discovered, go downtown...."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We sat at the bar and first ordered a couple of beers. Service started out great. We got our drinks our order was taken and then the bartender became sloppy and busy talking to other employees and guests. We had to ask for extra napkins, drink refills, silverware, our check. We could see the bartender at the other end of the bar, hanging out. We continued to wave him down to take care of us and refill our beverages. My husband and I each had 3 beers and were here for 2 hours watching basketball games. They were not busy. The Food was good, made fresh and hot. We ordered a burger, onion rings, queso and boneless wings. The beers were cold and fresh, we ordered tap. The service was just lacking."}
{"text":"Took a while to be acknowledged to be seated.  Several employees were just standing around talking.   Being an airport location you would think getting people seated, served and out would be a priority.  The food was pretty good.  I had the spicy shrimp tacos.  I would order them again.  Service was a bit slow but friendly.   Overall a good experience for airport food."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice since it recently opened. The pick up to go  was a horrible experience.  Fajitas  for 2  were cold but that's not a problem since there were no tortillas present.   Drove back, had them heat  some new ones ( I think they redid the old)   and even though I am under  5 minutes away they lost their heat. They just don't travel.  Avoid.  Manager was apologetic but  I get the feeling that it was cursory  rather than bollicking out the preparer for such an obvious error (   Trip Two .  Way better.  While the greeter was  decidedly not into  greeting us, there was something way more interesting occurring with a co worker , the server ,Robert,  rocked and for once I got the feeling that here's someone that's not being infected by whatever corporate style guide exists.    Food was  in reasonable time. hot, as  described and my (un)usual order of a bacon cheeseburger with black bean patty   arrived   intact.  Erin's chicken tacos were  pretty good but a look at the nutrition guide, post lunch, showed them to contain  more sodium and hfcs than Paris Hilton washing her mouth out with soda after making a video.   (no I'm not proud of that line,  lies  I'm quite proud of it: :)   In and out   in under an hour. Fountain drinks  had the right syrup mix  and the price was  reasonable.     While Yelp is providing me with many wonderful new places to try there are times, and it comes down to time where I need  to trade quality/ time ( e.g  lunch hour:) or places where a  crayon launching toddler is  not so out of place.      To get \"perlitical\" for a moment many eschew the idea of chains as a valid option  due to their  repetitiveness  and narrow range of food/ options which  are somehow as seen as inflicting a limited range on people that frequent them.    I like to treat them as if they were unique  and review them accordingly. If being in a chain means a reliance on frozen ready made parts to heat then  there's a hell of  a lot of independents shopping in the same freezer aisles / supply chain  alongside them and both should be called on it."}
{"text":"I am giving this a cautious 3 stars. I have been going to this location for years and every time it seems either the service is good OR the food is.  This used to be the best location with quick service but it's been on a steady decline for a while. We are at the point of thinking maybe chilis just isn't the place for us anymore."}
{"text":"It had been several years I haven't gone to this restaurant because I became a vegetarian. What drove me to come back was the coronarita. It was not as good as I was was expecting. Mostly sweet and sour mix with a beer in it. But their happy hour prices were really good. Overall, a C grade"}
{"text":"This particular Chili's is always on point like the Stacey Adams! Hahaha. Honey today they were bumpin' Bruno Mars throughout the restaurant, & it was my JAM#\"That's what I like!\" Uhh Huh! HaHaHa! That's one of my favorite songs! Okay, okay, I'm in love with his entire album! :) Chili's y'all get your props because playing Bruno's music throughout the restaurant made dining here more like an EXPERIENCE!  We've been to this location more than a few times and the food is always fresh & delicious! For our tizer (short for app, short for appetizer lol) we got the Triple Dipper! Now dip baby dip! Okay I'm going to put the dancing on hold for a minute~Hahaha. You can select 3 items which is cool! We chose the Big Mouth burger bites, Southwestern Egg rolls, & Honey Chipolte boneless chicken wings#Amazing! The sliders are packed with flavor! The bacon to cheese ratio is legit, & the caramelized onions compliment it well! We got mayo to slap on those sliders & that just makes them even more De-lish!   The Southwestern Egg rolls were off the chain!#So flavorful! They go perfect with that avocado ranch! The Honey Chipolte boneless wings were bomb-bay as well! Everything was so fresh & full of flavor! The Triple Dipper is definitely a new fav!  Usually we'll get the white spinach queso appetizer, & Sunrise Burger with egg for our main meal! They both are always so delicious! Today I was feeling tropical, so I got the Carribiean salad with shrimp & I added Avocado for $1.00. It was #Tropically delicious! I loved the pineapple in it, & everything blended well together! Full of Flavor! My party got the bacon cheeseburger which was delicious! The fries are always seasoned to perfection! We always get ranch to dip them in! #Delicious! The strawberry lem (short for lemonade) is always yummy!   Our server was nice & very attentive. He showed good customer service. Since we both took some of our food home and had ranch & mayo container cups, our server should have offered us bags to put everything in. Other than that he was great! We will be back for more FUN! :)"}
{"text":"Okay, so I know Chili's is Chili's!!!!  However, the experience is what captivated us!  Jeremy was such a wonderful human being and server.  Upon our arrival he got us water and asked us if we needed something else to drink.  Took our order checking on us adequately.  The drinks were delicious and the food not too bad.  Jeremy took good care of us."}
{"text":"Sorry guys, this one's gonna hurt; I've given way too many chances to Chili's, and at multiple locations. I am by no means a \"foodie\" but I know crappy institutional food when I taste it. The menu is chock filled with overpriced, pretentiousy described, (albiet mostly deep fried) previously frozen, sub standard fare. Kudos to the food photographer - but that's about it. What is the deal with this stupid pay kiosk??? You have to pay for any games on the silly device, and to boot, if tipping your server, are forced to an automatic 20%. My server did a less than mediocre job, and that does not get 20%. As previosly stated, the food is institutional at best, overpriced, and certainly NOT freshly prepared. This place, along with all the other sub standard generic corporate chains somehow still survives. Have faith in the \"mom and pop\" joints. They are out there. You just have to look beyond all the flashy advertising."}
{"text":"It's been a really long time since we've been at this popular chain restaurant. Two for $20 (share an appetizer & two entrees) is a pretty good deal and kid's meals are under $5.99. I figured we could check out some stores in the shopping center after dinner (we had some returns).  It didn't seem crowded, but there was a large party in the lobby. It was steady.   Service started off slow (there was an apology) but when we got our orders in, the food came out pretty fast. Our server checked in with us pretty frequently and refilled our drinks too.  We got the panko onion rings (perfect, crisp, seasoned just right, not greasy, not overdone) for our starter. Hubby got a burger (said it rivaled Red Robin), came with skin-on fries (just right), I got the fajitas (carnitas) with corn tortillas. I've gotten it here before but not the carnitas, was shredded and tender. It was really good. (Almost reminded me of Cozymels.) Little man got chicken nuggets (puffy batter) and fries. Good thing we asked our server, because the other chicken nugget choice was more breaded. We opted for the less breaded kind. He liked it, kind of a picky eater, but chicken is one of his favorites.  Hubby said we don't come here enough and I agree. Was one of my go-to restaurants during my college years. We had leftovers to enjoy for the rest of the weekend."}
{"text":"Of all the generic chain restaurants, Chili's is probbably my favorite.  They have an interesting menu with things like fajitas and buffalo chicken sandwiches.  I especially like the bottomless chips and salsa.  The chips are made fresh and are thin and sometimes still warm.  Additionally, if you eat in the bar they usually give you the chips and salsa for free.  On this last visit I got a bacon and cheese covered steak.  It was the only thing I've ever ordered that I wasn't completely satisfied with it.  The steak was cooked a little more than I requested.  It was good, but it wasn't worth the price.  Service is fine.  It can get a little busy during weekday lunch hours."}
{"text":"Best chilis I've ever been too the service is great loved my waitress Ashleigh she's the bomb .com"}
{"text":"The service was bad last night. And very slow service. Hope chills can get better at service the table left uncleaned after people left. What a mess not going back soon"}
{"text":"Why is it that this Chili's Sanitation grade continues to go down?  Today it is 87 ...bad...bad.  Does management not know how to fix the problem?"}
{"text":"Hot, fresh food, and excellent service. It's a great place to stop for a quick bite to eat. The restaurant is always clean, and the servers who wait on me are always friendly and attentive (refill drinks when needed, etc.)"}
{"text":"Just ordered takeout for lunch and I knew I shouldn't have given them another chance, but I did and I can tell you that I regret it fully. Of the estimated 8 times that we have ordered takeout from this place all 8 orders have been wrong, which is not a good track record. We discovered this complete blunder after getting home. I called to let the manager know and they apologized but offered no resolution other than us driving back down there and waiting on the replacement. We ordered the takeout while in town and have no intention of returning today since we are working on projects at home today. This is guaranteed to be the last time I pay patronage to this particular food chain. I'm not sure if the problem is reading, comprehension or they simply do not care to do their jobs to the most minute degree, but it has become beyond ridiculous. I worked here many years ago and I don't believe things have changed that much as far as duties are concern. So the person cooking the order did not do so correctly. The person who packaged the order did not do it correctly and lastly the person who is supposed to check the order before handing it over to the customer did not bother to do their job either. The first order was a triple play with two orders of boneless buffalo wings and one order of big mouth bites with no ranch or onion. This one came with one order of boneless buffalo wings, one order of egg rolls and bigmouth bites with both ranch and onion, which means they only managed to get 1/3 of this order correct. When providing a takeout service it is imperative to get it correctly since no one wants to pick up food, only to have to return later to have simple completely avoidable mistakes corrected. The staff needs to do their job (even slightly) or learn to read the tickets properly. They have definitely lost a customer in me."}
{"text":"Pretty excited! Chili's has updated their menus significantly and now have a bunch of allergen friendly menus. Me personally I'm only working through GF right now, but yay!! Our server was cool, my boyfriend ordered food and loved it, and everything was smooth. The only reason they got 4 instead of 5 is bc my order came with tortilla strips (which arent GF) so I had to send it back... but it was cool. I felt good when getting home. However, I WILL say they have a disclosure that they do not have designated cooking areas, so beware if youre highly sensitive (I'm not.)"}
{"text":"I went to chilis a few days ago, I got sirloin medium rare, it came out medium well, so I told the server and she said yeah it looks more medium and she said let me get you another, I said ok but I'm in bit of hurry, which I also mentioned at the beginning of the meal so she was aware. Steak came out she said go ahead and make sure it's ok. I started cutting and I couldn't cut into it, server said nothing, so I turned the steak and was able to see it was cooked right, then she left, and we never saw her again till very end when we were paying and I had to flag her down. I let her know that more then half the steak was fat and I couldn't eat it and that your manager and kitchen staff should know that this shouldn't be sent out to paying guest. She just said I'll let them know and left. Now I have no problem paying and I did cause what I did eat of the steak was good, but no manager came by and the server after I sent the first steak back  never came by to see how everything was. It just shows me a lack of care, and it made feel like I was being annoying, when I was just trying to get what I payed for. I've been a server for years I know how tough being a server can be, but when a guest made a complaint I did my best to make it better and show them that I cared about their experience, and I didn't feel that at all that night."}
{"text":"What can I say   I love it the best way to enjoy my Sunday was going to chilli's on power n  US 60 . Lets just say the guy we had was named Logan. Clean cut glasses positive  attitude and good posture... I mean this guy new how to treat  his customers from keeping the glasses full to making other rounds and then coming back to make sure everything was fine with the food that  we ordered. When it came time to check out he made sure everything was right ,even help us pack our leftovers now THATS services with a smile. Wish more place could hire people like Logan. I hope he enjoyed the tip we left thxs Logan you made it worth going there again and again..."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Took forever to get food and it wasn't even crowded.  Mediocre food.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Husband's order was wrong. My sunrise burger didn't have bacon on it. Waitress was not friendly, asked hubby what do you want 3 times. In a short/rude way instead of taking a friendly approach, since his order was not made right. Whole experience was awful. Didn't order anything else after that. We just wanted to leave. So we paid & left. Will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"The dark haired petite bartender who has been there forever is awesome.  The server that we had there a month or so ago,  Megan was the best we've ever had there.  Haven't seen her there since.  Everyone else doesn't seem qualified to work at McDonald's including the floor manager.  In our last 3 visits we've had inept servers every time.  I got the wrong meal and then when I didn't have time to wait for a replacement was still charged for it.  I got grief for using a coupon, one of the ones that you guys email me at least twice per week.  We have been coming there at least 2x/month for years.  Those days are over.  There used to always be a wait for a table.  I notice there isn't any more on weeknights.  That's not surprising.  The quality of the service has gone down significantly.  Too bad."}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant so when I give it 4 stars it is 4 stars for a chain restaurant. I'm not comparing it to gourmet dining. What I will say about this particular Chili's is that the servers here are amazing. We've been here several times recently because we've had to be in the area and this is right by the freeway exit. Eric. the one server, even remembered how I like my entree from the week prior. The other servers are also quite good and very attentive. The hostesses are friendly and the manager always checks in to see that everything is good.  The food is consistently hot and good, not great but again, it is a chain. I honestly couldn't expect more from the service end.  I did deduct one star because the place as a whole is a bit tired and the restrooms aren't always as clean as I would hope but overall it is a good place."}
{"text":"We waited 45 mins for a table when they said the wait would be 20-30 mins. Then we ordered food which at an additional 45 mins was still not out. We had a hungry, tired baby that had we gotten seated sooner would have eaten. It was the WORST service we have ever received at chills.  They said the manager would be over....and we never once saw her or him....smiles were great article sucked!!! Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Chili's is always a go to for my husband & I but we've always gone to the one on Rainbow. But we decided to try this one since it's down the street from us & it was the worst mistake ever. Waited about 10 minutes to be acknowledged at the door. Got sat & the table was filthy. We asked the hostess to wipe it down, \"she did\" leaving the food & trash on the seats & the table wet. We asked for napkins to dry it off & never got them. We were sitting for almost 20 minutes & the server never stopped by to even acknowledge us or take a drink order! Needless to say, we walked out of there."}
{"text":"Went there to have a couple of drinks, ended up eating here.  We got the 2 for $40 combo and got the 1/2 rack of ribs and the fajitas.  This is a LOT of food.  Got the fried pickles whcih were good and lets not forget the strawberry patron margaritas.  Place was packed with a 30 minute wait to eat, so we went to the bar and a lady leaving let us take her spot.  Service was a little slow but because of the amount of people that wouldn't surprise me!"}
{"text":"Everything was great at this location. The prices are reasonable and they do everything in their power to keep you happy. I come here occasionally and they never let me down. I love the tablet that they have on the tables. You don't have to ask the waitress for the bill you can just pay right then and there."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. The places was busy, we were seated quickly and taken fast with Mike. The salads were amazing and they hit the spot. We'll visit this location again. Maybe next time we will try the Baby back ribs!"}
{"text":"Just dined at Chilli's, Bar, and Grill at Northern Ave near 95th ave. The service is spot on, we were seated quickly and ordered our food. The waitress showed us the specials that fit our family well. Karyss was a great waitress!!"}
{"text":"Tonight I cane to Chili's and ordered a ribeye steak, which I wasn't personally a fan of. I was hesitant to inform the waitress, but when I did, she offered to replace it with something else from the menu and take the steak off of the tab. Really? That was so kind. Beyond that, the manager, (I assumed he was the manager) came over and offered me a free soup or salad for my trouble. This was no trouble at all! If anything, it was my fault. It was extraordinary service that you just don't see anywhere anymore. Thank you guys for making this such a pleasant experience for my family!"}
{"text":"Food is cooked slowly. Make sure you have time to sit around and not miss your flight."}
{"text":"I'm not a Chili's person.  It's been many years since I came to one.  We arrived to our gate at 9:30am, two hours early for our flight.  And we hadn't had breakfast so we stopped in for some grub, java, and comfortable seating.  First of all I was surprised by the coffee.  It's GOOD for restaurant coffee.  It can be pretty hit and miss in some places.  Just about anywhere I go I expect three cups.  And in many restaurants the waitress will neglect my empty cup which seriously effects their tip.  I'm the one paying the darn bill, you should endeavor to make me happy.  TIPS are for to reward good service in my book.    Well our waitress, Melissa, was on top of things, made sure I had plenty of coffee, surprisingly good coffee.    I ordered a Veggie Omelette and Enchilada Soup... yes, for breakfast.  That's some good soup.  My wife attacked my bowl until I drowned it Tabasco, lol.  Then I ended up having to buy her her own cup of soup.   Long story short... when we get back to Minneapolis I'm gonna hit up a Chili's.  If the coffee is as good and the service as attentive they'll have a new loyal customer."}
{"text":"can almost upgrade this to 4 stars as this airport is seriously lacking sports bars, hot food, non-franchise food offerings.  located domestic side near Tim Hortons, small layout considering travellers with their carry on bags bit I digress.  Ordered the appy baked cheeseballs, tasty enough.  casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Prices are typical for this type of restaurant.  I ordered the Prime Rib Burrito.  It sounded fantastic.  What you get is a burrito that is 95% rice and 5% prime rib.  There is no taste of meat when eaten.  Fajitas were good as was the half rack of ribs.  You can pay your bill at the table with their handy tabletop terminal, but beware the fine print because it adds 99 cents to your bill if you play a game on it."}
{"text":"Love Chili's. The staff here are awesome and the food is always great.  Honestly I get the best medium rare sirlions here over any other restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the grilled California flatbread pizza. I was terrific. My waiter Nick was very helpful!"}
{"text":"I think no matter what the service, if the service is actually yelling at you and the bathroom is actually to the point where it looks like it has been untouched for several days and you know this because of the chart on the bathroom door, then do you make a complaint such as 1/5 or even 0/5, think logically before you tear a business down before realizing there is more either going on something with the staff of even psychologically before coming to the conclusion of 0/5, think clearly before doing something ill conceived...  p.s.- Have you thought possibly they're just starting this routine with one of their branches and just looking to see how it is doing? Because there is a lot more going on than what you think in that cave-man or woman - like brain of yours.  By the way this is a regular customer just telling off the no-sayers; before they go telling all their friends that a great business that has provided for several years to family and friends service that not only respect, but see them as part of the family as everybody should, because just like family everybody has an off day, but doesn't mean you should be saying stupid things like their dumb or even horrible at service, because you think of it this way... You work retail or even sales; as a job, and you deal with every day things like a customer yelled at you because your salad was too cold or even your burger was slightly burnt, because you asked for it charred, that is your own damn fault people!!! Know what your saying, and then realize even if it isn't right someone could be having an off day. Not because they are incompetent but because they may be new, they may have had a break-up, or even the fact that they have a baby and they may be hormonal. Yes I said it, because you never know when you may have to stick up for your girl because of their pregnancy. All I am saying is, be respectful to the future of the United States of America....  Sincerely,   J.A.G."}
{"text":"Ugh our waitress was so slow in giving drinks taking order bringing out food and the check. Happy hour in Sunday is a great deal. We got chips and guacamole it tasted like mashed avocado instead of guacamole.  I tried the chicken crisper and they were in a waffle like batter so they weren't crunchy.  The grilled Caribbean salad is always a winner ."}
{"text":"We sat in the bar which is usually hit or miss but this time it worked out which was surprising because it was around 630pm on a Saturday. The bartenders were quick and friendly the food was great. I wanted a fried chicken sandwich but they only offered buffalo . He said it was fine not to add the sauce and with the home made pickles it was amazing. The only mess up with the order was the dressing was wrong and they didn't come clear the table fast enough"}
{"text":"I'm ne to Chili's and I like it. My first visit was sometime in May 2017 while in a Mlps suburb and this one has PLENTY points in effect unlike the St. Louis Park, MN location.   The service here is polite and mannerable but inefficient at best. Today I asked for no tomatoes and got tomatoes. The online ordering system doesn't afford modifications and I get they're trying to avoid people seeking more costing more money but at least let me remove somethings via online. I called to say no tomatoes and I guess it wasn't passed along.   They always seem to have a promo going and I like it.  They make their pickles. The slider burger doesn't disappoint.  I've been to this location twice for take out but today I had to dine in to redeem the $10 and everyone accommodated me.   The smoked wings are not what I expected as they were pale. Not smoked like Sonny's not smoked and charred like Hickory Tavern but it's nice to offer and next time maybe I'll just say smoke or let them sit a bit longer. It is nice to have more than fried.   They are running a summer time special now. Basically bar Happy Hour prices from 4p-7p then again from 9p-close. I don't think this includes weekends. I'll upload the pic so you can see.   Double and Triple check everything before leaving. Things may be overlooked and that's the inefficient part."}
{"text":"Service ain't the best.  Location is just okay Fajitas and salsa totally worth the trip.   SALSA:  Nice heat but still gringo style.  Not too chunky but you can see the veggies.  Good flavor.   FAJITAS:  Great amount of steak, shrimp and chicken.  Good char.  Nice amount of onions, bell peppers and red peppers.  Tortillas are soft enough Comes with their version of a Mexican rice and flavorful Black beans.  Pico, Sour Cream, Cheese, Scoop of Guac and Salsa.   Near Costco's on the hill.  Weird parking lot and togo door.  Could use some updating.  Always a deal or special with Plenty."}
{"text":"I love Chilis, but do yourself a favor and avoid this one. I should have paid attention to the other Yelp reviews. Something is wrong when you hear every table around you complaining.  I tried asking for broccoli instead of rice, but was told no, so i had to order another dish, unlike other Chilis.  The cheese for the fajitas was stale and rock hard  and the limes I asked for were so dry, I literally could not get a drop out of them. The portion of chicken for the fajitas was half what it normally is. Even after a manager got involved, they still forgot the broccoli.  Two stars instead of one only because a manager comped my meal, without asking, after several mistakes in a row."}
{"text":"It was an overall bad experience here.  The tables were sticky.  The glasses were dirty. The service was slow and the food was tasteless.  I would probably not return here."}
{"text":"Went to the location near the boulevard mall on S Las Vegas Blvd. Gretchen was out waitress. Fried cauliflower appetizer super yummy. Standard grilled steaks were quite tender. Reliable chain restaurant"}
{"text":"Typical chain food joint.  Went with my wife and sat at the bar and had a really good time.  Would go back again.  Left another place because of bad service and the staff at Chili's did an outstanding job.  Food was a expected.  Bartender was good with replenishing our drinks."}
{"text":"The food was tasty (burger, fajitas, quesadilla)!  They have good happy hour prices.  The service was slow because there were not enough servers, but it wasn't a horrible wait."}
{"text":"Clean establishment. Close to work. Ample parking. Good food.   I have just one more criteria for a short lunch during a busy work day and that is good service.  What would have made this a 3 out of 5 star rating for me would have been 'just good service' but our waiter wasn't attentive at all.  It took him a good 10 minutes to come to our table to take our order.  Timeliness of our food getting to the table was adequate as the items were hot and fresh. But after he delivered appetizers, he never came back to see if we wanted condiments (we did).  So we did the 'wave and a yoo-hoo' to get his attention. When he served our lunch, he never came back to see if we wanted condiments (we did again) or refills to our drinks and we had to do our 'wave and yoohoo!' again just to get his attention.   The reason I am docking my rating down to 2 stars is because the restaurant wasn't busy! Otherwise, it would be understandable that they might be short staffed and therefore, lacking in service. But this wasn't the case.  Might not go here again for lunch because there are other food places in the same shopping plaza."}
{"text":"Great service and great special! My waitress was busy but still attentive and kind! Her name is tabatha! Great place for cheap lunch!"}
{"text":"Chillis to me has always been a hit n miss type place. Todays lunch was a miss for sure..food came out a lil long, my food seemed over cooked the ribs was not tender my bbq chicken was a lil dry my seasoned frys were cold. Bout the only thing good was my corn on the cob. My pictures look great but the meal itself was just blahhh...this is why i don't come to chillis very often. Would i recommend it , no way! Service was horrible we basically had to hunt down a server for our water refills n a few other things such as more napkins. Smdh! I will not be coming back, hooters is next door that is were ill be...."}
{"text":"6 months ago my grandma had us goto coco's. yuk. So when we came to visit again i told my wife anything but coco's dennys etc... It was funny because we where suggesting chilis and black angus and she would bring up coco' each time. but i told my wife i am done with those type of places. So we got to goto chili's :-) i ordered the memphis dry rub ribs. Ive had them before and i love the flavor. The ribs where kind of dry and i had to rip the meat off the bone. It wasnt as dry as famous daves though. The ribs i got near home at chilis are a 5 but i can only give this one a 4."}
{"text":"If this had been a local business, it would have received 1-star, but since this is a chain, it barely holds on to a 2-star. My family and I go out to dinner every Monday and for this particular week, we settled on Chili's, who we had never really an issue with.   We were there about 5:30 on that Monday and were seated after about 10 min (there was no one else waiting for a table, just us) Finally after being seated, we sat another 15min before our waiter even came over to get our drink orders. At that point, we had already knew what we wanted, so we ordered our food as well to save time from killing ourselves from having to wait again.  The food was the normal Chili's food, but slightly colder and more 'thrown' on the plate than usual. The waiter tried to be kind, but it seemed like he was waiting on more tables that he should have (either that, or he was going outside to have a smoke after each visit to our table).  Overall, We were highly dissatisfied with the speed, quality, and customer service of this location."}
{"text":"2 stars  The only reason this isn't a one star rating is because the employees were friendly.  Ordered a Triple Dipper w/ two portions of chicken crispers and one portion of southwest egg rolls.  The egg rolls were just ok, but the chiciken \"crispers\" were nowhere near crisp! it's not like we let them sit in the box for a while before eating....we walked to the tables about 50 feet away and bit into the soggiest pieces of chicken we've ever had! you really couldn't make these any soggier w/o putting 'em in water!! The last few times I went to Chili's, I told myself that I would never go back........this is why.......not that the food is soggy, but because there's always something wrong with the food and it's never any good.  Trust me, you don't want anything from this ****hole in your stomach before you get on a plane!"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE!!!! Came in for Sunday dinner with a party 3. Our waitress took our drink order but could not take our food order because she said she had to greet another table who had walked in while we were ordering our drinks. She forgot one of my friend's margarita and never brought it out. We ordered our food and the party of 4 who came in 10 minutes after us got their food first, was able to finish it, walk out and leave before our waitress ever came back to us. After finishing my drink, the waitress refilled my cup with the WRONG drink and walked away. After that, she never bothered coming back. We literally waited over an hour and a half and our food NEVER came. Eventually we just got up and left"}
{"text":"Chili's is as Chili's does...   If you are a Chili's fan you certainly won't be disappointed by the location in Pottstown.  This location is easy to get to, the food is always hot and fresh, the service is always reasonable and the people are super friendly.  They almost always have some kind of special going on and it is just an all around good place to grab a bite when you don't want to spend a lot of money but still want a good burger, fajita or plate of nachos!  Wifey and I frequent this location and have always been pleased.  At one point Chili's was running a special -- if you check in at a Chili's in Foursquare you get a free chips and salsa.  I did so and asked my server... she had no idea what I was talking about.  But within minutes, she found out and credited us the cost -- easy as pie!"}
{"text":"Oh how i miss this place. food is always awesome and they finally have pretzel bread."}
{"text":"Eh, the server was EXCELLENT, but the food took about 45 minutes to come out. The server did what he could by providing us all you can eat chips and salsa ( which were really good by the way!) When the food finally came out, it was dry! I would have given a one (or zero stars) but like I said the server did try."}
{"text":"Normally we have a good time at chilis. One of my favorite places. Last night I wanted to go there for my bday dinner.  First we ordered steaks, I ordered med rare and got a hockey puck that was so burnt! I was too hungry to return it after waiting sooooo long but it was horrible.   Our server was good but what ruined our evening and made it so I never go back to chilis was the server next to us. A big guy with black glasses that was super miserable   My bf \"hey sir what's the name of the fighter on the tv? I can't see\"  Server \"it doesn't matter cuz the fights shouldn't be on\" he proceeds to then scream at the top of his lungs to the bartender. \"Turn the the fight off!!!! Turn that tv off!!\"  Our jaws were both dropped. He was sooo rude! And he left for about 5 mins and then did it again and then ran behind the bar and turned off all the fights.  Ppl even boo him.   Never in my life did I see something so rude. We even told them to pack our food up Togo to leave. Our server convinced us to stay but did a manager come by?! Nope   Worst bday dinner ever. We didn't even stay for cake we were so ready to just get out"}
{"text":"Plain and simple the portions are tiny and the food SUCKS! Now I remember why I've only been here 2 times in my life. Never again."}
{"text":"This is a good lunch/dinner spot to go to that is not crowded,  has a good happy hour menu,  and a friendly staff. I normally get their Santa Fe chicken salad,  and I am now addicted. I crave it AT LEAST once a week,  and everytime I come here,  I don't need a menu because I know what I'm ordering. This place also has a fast takeout/curbside service. I would recommend if you live in the area or are around this area often for a fair priced decent fulfilling meal!"}
{"text":"The food was good. It's a step up from years ago. The female service was nice. But the water was terrible. It's the worst water I've ever had in my life. When we told our waitress she told us that everyone complains about it but it's filtered and it's just how Arizona water is. I've lived in AZ for over 26 years. I've NEVER had such terrible water. It tasted like  like dirty public pool water with extra chlorine. It leaves a residue on your tongue. I felt sick which is why I just wanted h20 but since my entire party hated it we all got drinks. Which they charged us for. Maybe it's a sloppy sales strategy. But I wouldn't feed that to my dogs. I could taste it through the drinks as well. I'd recommend a different location."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and don't think I'll ever go back. Not sure of my waitress name, but if you're gonna do the \"I don't have to write anything down, I do it all by memory\" thing, you better at least be halfway good at it. We order our food and she doesn't write anything down at all, just \"I got choo\". Forgot our silverware to start off with. Wife asked for no onion topping her potato soup - she got onions. My fajita's were supposed to come with rice and beans for a dollar extra, guess what, forgot the rice and beans. We ordered the chips and salsa, got a plate of broken little pieces of chips. Forgot the straw for my wifes drink. Food was cold. Just not a very good experience."}
{"text":"If this is based on service then it would be 4 stars. My server was friendly and had a family vibe. Unfortunately I came just before 10 and I ordered the two eggs sausage toast and potatoes. The eggs were really salty and my toast was pretty on one side and burnt on the other. The sausage was really salty. I couldn't finish my meal even though I raised to clear my plate I just couldn't. Will I come here again? Maybe... Maybe I'll try the lunch/dinner menu. I would definitely not come back here for breakfast. I could honestly get better at McDonald's."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible.  We were seated at 6:00, but did not get our food for 45 minutes!! The restaurant was not busy either. We had our two little grandsons with us and by the time the food came, they were so impatient and over hungry. When we got the food, it was the worst we have ever had at this establishment. My broccoli was half cooked with no seasoning, the grilled cheese looked like it had sat under a warmer for a long time (and tasted like it) and the fries were terrible.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"The waitress, Kaitlyn, was seriously the best waitress ever. She kept up with our giant order, many drinks, and additional things we wanted to add. I had 4 refills of lemonade last night and not once did I have to ask for one! They don't have yager bombs but she still managed to make one! When she asked my boyfriend for his ID, she must have realized and made a note that he just turned 21 yesterday and came out at the very end of our meal with the whole staff singing happy birthday with some ice cream. She was so sweet and works very hard. Give that girl a raise!  For the food -- everything was a 10/10. Their quesadillas are so good, the chips & salsa/guac were so good I almost got full off of them. Chili's is definitely not like this back home in Cali!"}
{"text":"If great service, excellent food and a great atmosphere constitute a 5 STAR rating well this Chill's gets one!  My server was prompt, friendly but not pushy.  Had the Chicken Enchilada soup which was outstanding.  The Grilled Chicken Salad was also excellent.  Can't wait to go back.  5 STAR all the way!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good. Staff was friendly, drinks were made well and always topped off. Definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"I typically wont write bad reviews, i just wont return but last night was some of the poorest service ive had in a while. I waited to be sat which i dont mind but then waited a good five minutes or so before even being acknowledged by a server then five more minutes before our actual server arrived still with no drinks. I waited a total of fifteen minutes from the time i sat down with no drinks. From the time i sat down until the time i left, which was close to 2 hours because of absolutely how dreadfully slow the service was, all the tables in view were dirty. And stayed dirty. No wonder i have to wait ten minutes to be sat because no one knows how to table turn. And im sorry but id rather not look at peoples tables the whole time im eating. When the food finally arrived our meals were cold and overcooked and barely palatable. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came in on my last night in Vegas and the service was great. We sat outside where it was cold and windy but they were amazing enough to turn on the heaters for us. We had a great time, which is great because I never used to be a Chili's fan growing up."}
{"text":"Thought I would take a few employees here for the last day at my office, mistake number one I guess Monday night should have been an easy day for a restraunt. I waited about 10 minutes after being seated just to get a drink order, ok it happens another 15 minutes to bring drinks back...? Placed  the order 25 minutes after that food started arriving only 5 of us there  in the party food  served in three different drop offs no apology from manager asked to speak with him and he was actually snooty and rude walked away from the conversation as I was explaining what was wrong probably the poorest in the handling of customer service I have ever experienced. The waitress in no way was at fault you can tell the proble,s were due to poor staffing I ensured the waitress it wasn't her fault even tipped her $60 on a $120 tab will never recomend or go back to this restraunt again the manager in question I was advised was actually the store manager Asian gentleman all I can say regarding this experience is WOW"}
{"text":"The 2 for $20 special wasn't a bad deal. The guacamole was just average but the chips were fresh and crisp. I enjoyed my chicken bacon ranch quesadilla. My wife said the mango chicken was just average. A little slow on our service but not terrible. A 3 1/2 star meal."}
{"text":"First let me say my husband and I have visited this Chili's many times, and our experiences usually are good. But last evening my meal was horrible.  We were welcomed by our waitress and ordered our meals.  I ordered the Mango-chili chicken without the spicy sauce on top that I have ordered before.  The waitress stated they were substituting green beans for the broccoli because they ran out.   After a short wait our meals arrived.  I was unable to eat the green beans because they had NOT BEEN COOKED!  Impossible to even chew. I called another waitress over and she took the beans back to the kitchen.  Then I realized that the chicken was covered in the spicy habanero sauce. When the green beans returned I was still unable to eat them. Terrible!  The waitress returned and my husband informed her that their was sauce on the chicken and the green beans were still uncooked.   No manager came to our table or did the waitress offer to deduct the meal.   We should of demanded to talk to the manager or refused to pay for the meal!!!!!"}
{"text":"We asked for table side guacamole and our waiter said \"I'll make it for you then bring it out\" then I said \"no, we want TABLE SIDE GUACAMOLE\" he again said \"trust me on this. .. I'll make it for you then bring it out and I won't charge you the table side price.. we are too backed up in the kitchen.\" I told him to go tell his manager what he told me or I was going to tell him.... judging by the managers reaction when he came to our table... he most likely told all his servers to do this on their shift. Eat at the one on Las Vegas Blvd or go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We just moved down here and twice we have had to resort to Chilis for whatever reason over the past 2 months.  The location from where we came never really had issues in the kitchen but service always seemed to be a pain point so I was hoping for the best.  In both cases, we had the same server, who really is not all that bad other than slight uncomfortable silences after checking in.  However, both times, her food was either raw, cold, or both.  First time, she got some chicken finger things with sauce on the side.  Breading was falling off like rubber and the chicken was still raw!  Tonight, beef and chicken fajitas against my better judgement.  Steak still bleeding and cold in the center, completely raw veggies floating in steam sauce is what it looked like to me.  We sent it back and it was returned sizzling and popping with an added flavor of fiah or shrimp.  I hate Chilis but the wife was a believer back home, now she is convinced this place sucks finally.  This location is the worst Chilis I have had to endure!  Never again."}
{"text":"??The manager HIMSELF let his server serve me the coldest and most stale chips ever... Not so yummy..when I asked for a new fresh batch the manager proceeds to tell me he couldn't and that ALL the chips would taste like that. Who ever is letting the night shift manger run this restaurant needs to be fired right along with him ! *i was here Wednesday at 9:40pm*    Ps. If this is how the manager acts how do you think his employees act ? HORRIBLE SERVICE      Pss. I should've threw my sorry ass margarita at him that tasted like nothing other than a strawberry lemonade"}
{"text":"We eat here way too much.  How do I know?  The waitresses know us and where we like to sit (the bar so we can watch sports of course).  Good menu and you know what type of quality you are going to get.  Good bar selection and I have to admit the baby back ribs are pretty good especially with the Shiner Bock sauce.  My other fav is the Smokehouse burger.  The tacos are also pretty decent.  Great service (but that might be because we are regulars) and good food consistently.  Can't go wrong with that although after working for a food service company I am not a big fan of chains, but this is one I do like"}
{"text":"My wife and I go here pretty regularly. Sure its a large chain restaurant, but their Steak Fajitas and Queso are always great and the quality is pretty reliable. I've always had good luck with the service as well."}
{"text":"They need to train their line cooks how to cook food.  Medium rare does not mean rare and cold.  YUCK."}
{"text":"OK so from my HORRID experiences at all other chilis I've been to it took a lot for me to even give this place a try... Granted no way no how I would order a salad from this place... (Past Chilis salad experiences include having my salad be alive... there was a cockroach/pincher bug in it, and before that an industrial staple in one) So I\"m sure you can imagine me being hesitant.  Anyways my friends wanted to go here, I was in their car... whatever fine... I'll just drink my calories:) I agreed to try the chips and guacamole. They were straight up legit.  I also had some fried jalapenos... yumm All day happy hour on Sundays... sing me up. I'm a sucker for cheap liquor:)  Oh also there is always some sort of entertainment happening... not by their choice more on the line of random ridiculously drunk people. And I'm not one of those people"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating there great service and the food taste great   I've tried their  bacon beef quesadillas10/10 chicken crisper with waffles 10/10 Texas fries with jalapeños 10/10 Sunrise burger 8/10   Presidents margaritas  Mango 7/10  Strawberry 10/10 Original 10/10"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!  I will be brief because I would spend way too much time writing on how bad this place is.  1. When we asked not to be sat at the bathrooms, the hostess rolled her eyes and pointed to a table behind the 1 she wanted to sit us. After saying once again, \"I don't want to sit at the bathrooms please,\" she huffs and throws our menu's at the 3rd booth and walks away. Normally I would have left but it was the only place open on Christmas Eve night so we had to stay.  2. Our waitress, Kris, took her sweet time in getting to our table just so we can order our drinks. I was able to sit down at the table, take my jacket off, get the baby situated, realize the baby needed a diaper change, go and change her diaper, come back and it took her 10 minutes to show up to take our DRINK orders. My husband got a fork where the prong was bent straight up and he had to ask her 5 times for a new fork. She was very slow, fake attitude, and didn't listen to anything we had to say.  3. The food....I would have eaten Moist n Meaty dog food and it would have tasted better. Since I wasn't all that hungry, I ordered a Caesar salad and baked potato soup. The dressing on my salad tasted like somebody poured it on the floor, danced a jig on top of it, and scooped it back up to put on my salad. It even looked bad! Caesar salad dressing should look creamy, kind of a pale tan color....this had a dark tint to it and smelled horrible. My husband also got a Caesar salad and he had the same problem. He ordered a cheeseburger that was a hockey puck. The only thing that was good was the skillet dip, the chips weren't even good! They were from the bottom of the pile, broken in a million tiny pieces, most of them were burnt, and salty as hell. We didn't even finish our meals it was so disgusting.   Since we didn't have a good experience with the hostess (which we found out it was the manager), we didn't even bother complaining about the food or the service. It was not worth the $30.52 at all. Nobody got a tip and we will NEVER go back there again. STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"Very slow service, with a long wait for our food as tables around us who came later were served.  Chipper waitress kept coming by and singing \"food is almost done!\" which became irritating after a white since it obviously wasn't true. When it finally came out, one meal was wrong and had to go back. More waiting . . . . I would skip coming her at peak hours. We came on a Sunday at noon."}
{"text":"This is officially the last time we will be visiting this location. Not because of the food, but the ignorance of the service/server. When is ok to grab a receipt off the table and crumble it up in your face and then walk off in a huff? Some may not think it's a big deal, but I think it's a huge deal and is extremely unprofessional and disrespectful. That little tantrum cost the server a tip. Sorry, but I don't tip disrespectful people. I will however travel out of my way to try a different location with better reviews."}
{"text":"We went to this Chili's after church on Sunday around 1:30 8/24/14.  When we walked  into the restaurant there was a couple in front of us waiting for a table and no host to be found anywhere.  The couple appeared disturbed and the male walked around the restaurant a couple of times trying to locate an employee, and didn't seem like he found anyone.  I was watching him and i did not see anyone that worked there in the entire restaurant at that moment either...odd.  The female said that the host acted like it was an inconvenience for him to clean a table so they could be seated.  When the host finally came back, he tried to seat them, but the seats were too wet for them to sit, so again the male walked around the restaurant to try and locate someone to dry the seats, again, to no avail, so they just left.  This wasn't our experience, but the host did seem annoyed.  He ended up seating us at another table."}
{"text":"I went into the location on Decatur Blvd in the costco parking lot in Las Vegas this evening with my husband. We were in a bit of a hurry and told the bartender right away that we were going to be quick and easy and just wanted chips and salsa and waters. The bartender, Michelle, was extremely friendly, polite, professional.. I couldn't say enough kind words about her. She is truly a spectacular employee to have on your team. Michelle had our chips and waters out in less than a minute and had everything refilled before we were even finished. She was consistently tidying up the bar and tending to all of her other customers while we ate. She was productive, clean, and smiling the entire time. The last time I visited this chilis, I wrote a bad review because the old bartender had literally said 'we are really busy, it's gonna be a while' quite rudely. This time, this bartender won five stars across the board. Thank you for having Michelle!"}
{"text":"I always know when I eat at Chili's I will get not only good food, but also a good value for the money. Recently tried the curbside to go and will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the neighborhood and since we had a coupon for a free appetizer we decided to stop and have an early dinner. There was plenty of parking We got there early, 5 PM, was seated in the back, only a couple of tables from the server's station.. The food was good and hot which is pretty consistent with all the other Chili Restaurants. Server was attentive. My wife had the Southwestern Eggrolls for her dinner and I had the classic Bacon Burger.  Everything was good as usual. When we left, the place was filling up for a Thursday."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for awhile.  Had the classic sirloin 6 oz with sauteed mushrooms and 3 Spicy Garlic & Lime Grilled Shrimp.   When my order came, it was missing the shrimp.  The steak was cooked okay, but it really looked like a 4 oz. I substituted the vegetables with a sorta fruit cocktail. It had mostly tasty tangerines and one other fruit, maybe mango. When my shrimp came, it was the size of three quarters and not worth the extra $3.  My wife and daughter shared the Tostada Chips and Queso followed with the Triple Dipper of Southwestern egg rolls, loaded potato skins and Big Mouth Bites. Those weren't bad at all.  Good place for burgers and appetizers."}
{"text":"Again, for a Thursday evening this place was packed but to our surprise we were seated promptly. The restaurant had a new menu so I tried the Smokehouse Combo: fried chicken and jalapeno cheddar sausage with chili garlic toast, garlic dill pickles, homestyle fries and new roasted corn. My wife ordered the Southwest Egg Roll, which is her favorite, and the Tortilla Soup which she also enjoyed. As for my meal, the good items were the sausage which had the heat and the cheesy flavor, dill pickles which I wish would have been more than just four small slices, and the fries which were not soggy and limp. I also had a coupon for a free appetizer, Southwest Egg roll. Now the bad. The chicken was a small breast which was almost dry and no flavor. The toast felt like a sponge, not even the edges were crisp. The corn was not fresh and was smothered with Southwest spices. We'll, I like my corn with butter, but it was okay, not great. Our server was okay, never really introduced herself or maybe I didn't hear her."}
{"text":"Spent $9 on to go fries.... you'd think they'd be pretty delicious for $9 but never been so disappointed :("}
{"text":"Every time we go into this location it takes about 10 minutes to get greeted then a extra 10 minutes on top of that to have a server come by. We decided to give it another shot last week and again nothing has changed. They aren't a busy store at all. I am a server and am appalled to see how this store is ran. The servers take a long time for any type of service as well as refilling and pre bussing. Lazy.. Wont be back."}
{"text":"I came to this location twice. The 1st time the service was slow, food was under cooked, & just wasn't a pleasant experience. I figured if it was a fluke & gave it another chance a month or so later. Yeah that wasn't the best idea cause the service was even worse & the food, specifically the chicken, tasted like cardboard. NEVER again will I dine at any Chilis"}
{"text":"Went to chills to get take out for dinner since my wife and I like to stay in.Ordered online and got fajitas quesadilla and onion rings.  Got there 10 minutes early and we wait for 10 before anyone spoke to us. Then we were told to pay at the bar. I had an old gift card with 25 dollars and it came out to 24.90. So I just put 25 dollars.  As a former pizza delivery person I don't tip on pick up because they aren't using gas, their own car and are not serving me like a waitress. I always tip 15% minimum and not until I get my food. We sat and waited for awhile then a man on drugs dirtyish as if he was homeless start talking to us in the waiting area. Trying to sell me supplements or join his pyramid scheme I couldn't tell.  I was desperate to get out of there. My food was suppose to be ready at 9:20 and was ready at 9:35. The lady came out while he was mid speech. I took my food and left.  I got home starving, just wanting to eat and touched my 1st tortilla. Cold. Okay don't panic cold tortillas aren't bad. Meat. Cold. Quesadilla, onion rings, everything is cold. I am very angry at this point. I look at my sides my cilantro isn't even enough to be a side and has a black thing in it that resembles a booger.  None of the sauces even touch the halfway mark. So I go online and fill out a complaint form. I wait a day for a reply. None.  I post @chilis on Twitter with photos of my food they tell me to fill out a online complaint form. I reply I did already. I am ignored. When I was stationed in Japan I ate at the base chilis all the time and it was great.  I lived in flagstaff and that chilis was great. The chilis at metro center in Arizona is horrible.  The kicker is this happened on my birthday, thank you chili's. Food is temporary but a memory lasts a lifetime."}
{"text":"Be careful when you order take out from here. They got our order wrong and forgot a few things. The chicken on my grilled chicken salad was ice cold and showed no signs of it ever even touching a grill (was home and eating in 10 minutes). There was no dressing on the salad and none was in the container or in the bag so I had to eat a dry salad. My wife had ordered a vegetarian friendly salad and it had chicken on it. They reluctantly remembered her dressing. They also forgot our chips and salsa. I hope that they start paying more attention to carry out orders or they are likely to lose some customers."}
{"text":"Its been over a year since I had Chili's. I had a taste for some ribs and it really hit the spot."}
{"text":"UGH.   Went here a couple weekends ago for a date night as a fluke because we had a gift card. What a disaster and disappointment.   Disclaimer #1: I don't expect much from chain restaurants in the first place, so keep that in mind with my rating.   Disclaimer #2: I've been to another Chilis location in the recent past. I know what to expect.   Ordered an appetizer sampler, 3 beers, and two entrees - both sizzling fajitas, \"Cadillac style\". $70 bill.   Service was subpar, if I am being generous. Took a long time for our drink orders, longer for our appetizer order and longer yet to place our dinner order. Dining time was over 2.5 hours when we expected to pop in for a quick meal after a long day.   Had to remind the staff of very simple details, such as if you bring us our entrees we need plates and silverware. Also had to remind them of things like \"Hey, we paid you guys an insane amount extra for very tiny sides of rice and beans...where are they?\" Oh excuse me waitress...the fajitas are supposed to come with tortillas. Real popular menu item, figured they know. Good thing we did!  The onion/pepper part of my entree was greasy, and undercooked but still burnt. Onions and peppers are meant to be sautéed, not quickly grilled to a burnt crisp. No brainer for a Mexican restaurant you'd think.   Everything was overly salted. Disgustingly salty.    Will quite literally never go back. No reason to even consider it. Price, service, quality, taste and atmosphere are terrible - aka 0/5"}
{"text":"I was here a few months ago for lunch and the food was pretty good. Service was average. Today was a busy day for my wife and I so I stopped at chili's and ordered 2 dinners for carry out at the bar. I ordered one house salad and two crispy chicken sandwiches with fries. I couldn't believe the salad when I got home. It contained 85% bad, discolored, pieces of salad, pretty disgusting. Both chicken sandwiches had a clump of shredded lettuce that was all brown, mushy, and bad. Each sandwich had one very thin sliced, old and dried tomatoe. I tried to salvage the sandwich by scraping the lettuce off but it had made the bun half it was on too soggy and just not feasible to do. I normally have a beer or drink at the bar while waiting for my food order but this bar tender never Approached me after placing my food order. I can say I sure didn't get any enjoyment from the $30 including tip I paid. It was a total waste. Why isn't there a qualified manager present supervising service employees and providing a little oversight to ensure customers are treated satisfactorily? If nothing else then to prevent service employees gathering together and shooting the bull instead of waiting on customers in a timely and appropriate manner. I think you may agree with me that I'd be a fool to go back there to eat."}
{"text":"Have. Not been  here in a few years, but saw they had changed there menu and figured I give it a try.     I got a burger and it was good.  Nice flavor ,nice bun, and I really liked the frys.  And the service was very good. The  hostess  who sat us was very pleasant and has a great attitude. And our waitress  was  great.   I will be back to try other stuff on there new menu."}
{"text":"We had lunch there today and the service wasn't that good. They weren't busy but it took a while for our server to make contact.  After placing our order, my friend asked for some chips and salsa and that took a while to come. Our server thought we wanted it with our meal. She should've asked. We waited a good 20-25 minutes for our meal and I even ordered the lunch special. When we got our bill, our drinks and chips were comped for the wait. But that wasn't the point. The service could have been better. I really likes the new feature where you can pay at your table."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times while at the airport on layovers.  The first time everything was good, lots of tasty food at a reasonable price. The second time, I ordered the same thing (Mexican chicken bowl) at the same price but it seemed the portion was significantly smaller.    The last visit I ordered the Southwestern Chicken Caesar. The only thing southwestern was the sprinkle of tortilla strips on top and the somewhat-spicy chicken, they forgot the tomatoes. In fact to call it a Caesar salad was a stretch, no bacon (or capers) so basically a bowl of lettuce with dressing, a handful of pre-cooked chopped chicken and a pinch of parmesan and tortilla strips. I've had better salads from the grocery store, for half the price. I ate elsewhere on my next layover."}
{"text":"Ordered TOGO from here a few weeks ago and when I got it home they had forgot both sides to my ribs. We ordered 2 rib meals. I called and the restaurant and she said that we could have a comp meal the next time we ordered.   I believe I spoke with a manager as I gave my name and phone number.  A few weeks later I called to redeem my meal and place an order, but the person I spoke to said they don't do comp meals and would've sent me something in the mail.  I never received anything. I didn't get the name of either person I spoke with but I'll never eat there again. I live in Queen Creek so it's a 30 min drive to pick it up in the first place.  With all the restaurants out there competing I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Our waiter was an odd man. He was the one to seat us and literally the second we sat down he asked what we wanted to order. Really? I mean, yeah it's Chili's and the menu is basic but give us a few. So we asked him to come back in a bit- he was circling back within a minute. Still, we were undecided. So, of course, once we figured out what to order it took our server 10 minutes to come around! And he was lurking over us through most of the meal. It was just a strange experience, and it sort of wrecked the meal. It was like any time we actually needed him he was never around and when we wanted some privacy he was all over us. Makes me realize how the good servers have some innate sense as to when they should drop in to your table.  I had some enchiladas, which weren't bad. My wife ordered a chicken sandwich on pretzel bread- our daughter had the cheese quesedillas. The food was average at best. The sodas were flat and refills non existent."}
{"text":"It was the same good service. nothing really speacial its just another Chillies."}
{"text":"Service was horrible!! Restaurant was VERY dirty! I eat here 5-6 times a month... different one over the valley.... this has been the worst! :("}
{"text":"Decent food, good service, great view of the ramp, very steep prices.  Still, enjoyable meal, captive audience."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this location! We have been many times and are always impressed with the terrific customer service! Our waiters and waitresses are always so outgoing and courteous. I don't know what they are doing to train their employees, but it's working! My husband goes through drinks super fast, and they always bring refills when his glass is about half full, he doesn't even have to ask. We love the 2 entree/1 appetizer for $20 deal they do (it's so much food that we normally have enough to take home for lunch the next day) & they even usually send us home with a bag of fresh chips and salsa when we order that as our appetizer. You can't beat the price and service! Thanks for being awesome, Chili's. (Only one small complaint - the games on the tablets they have at the tables cost a dollar or something to play, and that wasn't explained well the first time we visited. We were a bit surprised at the charge as other restaurants haven't charged us for similar games.)"}
{"text":"i have been to this location several times. this time wasn't so great.  I live over 20 miles away and my disabled son had a doctors apt at 2pm just down the street from this location. so we thought we would stop for lunch.  I left my home at 12:15 and we arrived at the location about 12:50pm. sat down and quickly ordered drinks and then the 2 for $20 in which I ordered the Cajun chicken pasta WITH EXTRA TOPPINGS (and I made sure she knew what I was talking about by stating \"you know the sauce, tomatoes etc?\" she said yes extra toppings. daughter ordered classic burger with fries and our appetizer was the new fried pickles. the pickles came out fast and were very hot. as we got towards the bottom the off tasting set in and to see the BROWN grease pooling in the bottom of the container was enough to know they haven't changed the oil lately.  finally the entrees come and low and behold my pasta is the REGULAR way. after a few minutes I ask the server for more alfredo sauce. I sit there and wait and wait. finally she brings it and by now I ask for a box because I have run out of time. I box my meal ( think I ate about 5 bites) and my daughter is about finished. OH AND BY THE WAY- I HATE those kiosk things. how my daughter managed to charge $2 by playing games to my check I don't know! DONT LET YOUR KIDS PLAY with that machine unless you want additional charges added to your check!  I paid with the kiosk because I couldn't wait on my slow server anymore and the stupid thing did not print out my receipt !i had less than 15 minutes to load up my son and get around the corner.  slowest server I have ever had. I was in a hurry but this is why I ASKED FOR MY ENTREE in a specific way- so I didn't have to ask again later!  the grease apparently got to my daughter, because as soon as I had loaded my son in the car she was at the front of my car and threw up.   I am so disappointed. I usually love Chili's but today wasn't their best by far!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chilis around. I am addicted to their chips & salsa!  Should you eat in they will refill it as much as you want- their chips are so thin & crisp unlike any I have ever had. & like mentioned before bag you up some to take with you.   I always get the Cajun chicken pasta- love it!! I get extra everything in it- I like a lot of sauce on mine & seems they never put enough. The portion is large!   The 2 for $20 is a great deal for dinner! The lunch specials are great prices also.  I do not however like the ribs- the one time I had them they had a false smoke flavor, were dry & the sauce wasn't my taste.   We normally get takeout that way we can sit home in our jammies in front of the tv watching a movie or 2 ordered from online like Netflix etc. (if ordering a steak for pickup have it under cooked so it will be to your liking once home & re-heated)  Also I love the ease of placing my online order to go with my smart phone app, which if you like them on FB or sign up for emails you can get some awesome coupons!!"}
{"text":"Our server was amazing! He was pulling a double and he had more energy than anybody else there last night. He made sure that all of our request were taken care off. He even helped us get a great deal for our food! Food was excellent too! Only give four starts because my silverware was not washed correctly and had food in it which is a big no no for me. Besides that everything was great!"}
{"text":"My fault for ordering poorly, but I wanted something easy to eat. The food was very sad; arrived soggy, looking reheated in a microwave and slightly cold on the inside. The service unfortunately was just as bad. Slow, inattentive and lacking basic standards of sit down food service. I was not offered a beverage until I asked for water after my sad food arrived and was never given napkins or utensils, even after requesting them.    I think any of the other food options in this terminal would have been better."}
{"text":"Let me start with the good - fantastic margarita. Now, what I did not care for. The music was WAY too loud, I guess I am just getting old. The food was WAY too salty (but I did eat it all, salty does not mean it wasn't good). Again, just too old.  I will come back but I would be happier with less volume and salt."}
{"text":"Let me just say this was the worse chilli's I have ever ate. And this comment stems from a second chance after the first nightmare which I went when they first opened. This time around it was slow we was greeted by a young lady at the door who also happen to be our waiter we ordered drinks didn't ask if we wanted to start with a appetizer as soon as we ordered drinks she left for 10minutes came back no drinks asking us are we ready to order or still waiting for drinks I then politely told her we will wait for drinks but I'll like to start on a appetizer she left didn't return until 15 minutes like with appetizer after the bar tender add already dropped our drinks off to us mind you we are sitting on the furthest wall opposite from the bar. When she brought the appetizer she then ask are we ready to order our lunch. We had only took 2 bites of queso and chips so we felt completely rushed so we went ahead and ordered food took at least 30minutes to come out. She sat the food down and walked away then disappeared. Being  that we had sangria we were in need of water but our waitress had disappeared again so another waitress brought us out water. She was gone the rest of our visit she didn't not return until after we finished speaking to the manager . Another disappointment for my mother and I. I was going to order my fiancé a meal Togo I changed my mind and did Car Side to go at Applebee's for him."}
{"text":"My wife and I have had them four times this month and they are no fluke.  I was down on this location from some time ago but whatever changes they have made have been great.  Twice ordering from home and twice in restaurant, the quality of the food has and consistency has been outstanding.  The new fajitas are great and easily enough for two meals.  We thought quality would suffer upon take out and there has been no signs of slipping.  Packed well, hot, and tasty.  Only criticism would be a dirty bar area and it wasn't too busy.  But staff has been great."}
{"text":"This is an average Chili's. I ordered chicken tacos. They weren't very flavorful and the soft shells were a little stale. My wife ordered the bacon ranch quesadilla and it was ok. Service was decent. Nothing special here."}
{"text":"Today we stopped here for lunch on our way to Flagstaff and what a pleasant surprise! We were greeted right away and seated in a booth as requested. Chris our server did an exceptional job!! He was friendly, knowledgeable and made great suggestions!  We split two lunch specials, the sliders and the chicken Tex-Mex bowl. Chris had the kitchen split the orders and brought us each one plate. Super!   The food quality was excellent with perfect lunch portions!! The restaurant was very clean. I don't visit Chili's very often however after today will return in the near future."}
{"text":"We haven't come back since my boyfriend left his wallet. I came to pick it up an hour later since he was at work, and money was missing. Not worth the money it ended up costing."}
{"text":"I typically try to avoid this location. Chili's isn't my favorite but the mister likes the mango chicken or the margarita chicken.   When I go, I usually order the sirloin with mashed potatoes and upgrade a side for asparagus with cherry potatoes.   Tonight, either they were just slammed because partial of the restaurant was under renovations but our order came slower than usual.   Our oldest daughter ordered chicken bites but we were told the kitchen staff ended up burning them so they made her chicken tenders and were going to comp the kiddie meal off the ticket. Pretty decent. We didn't say much but were pleased they took considerations.   My complaint was the salt level on the food. Both our full menu items (sirloin and the mango chicken) Disappointment occurred with my asparagus. I upgraded a side only to not be able to eat any. :(   I'm glad at least they are in the mist of renovation as the entire place needs an overhaul."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my roomies. We were starving so we ordered appetizers and drinks to start. We got the cheese curds and texas cheese fries. Both were very good. So good in fact that we almost didn't need dinner. It felt like the food took forever to come so that may have been part of it. I had a watermelon margarita and it was super yummy. Would have ordered them all night if i wasn't so full.   I ordered a steak and it came with steamed broccoli and skillet potatoes. I prefer the loaded mashed potatoes, but the skillet potatoes weren't bad.   Service was decent and we constantly had drink refills so i cant complain. They have a tablet thing on the table where you can play games. I had clicked on something but didn't actually select a game or play anything, however it did charge me $0.99. Crappy!  We were able to split the check easily the tablet though and pay for our food without having to wait for a check which is a nice bonus. Overall a pretty good experience. Im sure ill be back for those watermelon margaritas!"}
{"text":"We were a little worried when we first walked in - the place was a ghost town and the waiter was not very encouraging  Amazing turnaround in service  The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable as we had a couple of heavy duty vegetarians with us  Overall good experience"}
{"text":"Wow. Where to begin.  Took ten minutes to be greeted by wait staff.   Ordered the \"Crispy\" chicken crispers (that were half cooked) the corn on the cob was cold , fries were soggy as hell . Chicken \"crispers\" can probably be renamed chicken \"chewy's\" since they weren't crispy at all.   Bathrooms were absolutely disgusting  Dined on a Tuesday night at 5:30 restaurant was dead. Wouldn't be surprised if this one closed soon .  Avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"*the only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because of the horrible service by Robert but please read as others are AMAZING!!* My husband and I come to Chili's fairly often because we love the service we get at the bar, especially when Dani's working.  Today, as we are sitting at the bar, waiting for our food, I look up to see a server (Robert) who is asking other tables if they ordered fajitas (which were amazingly delicious by the way - Steak and Shrimp).  By the time I finished putting a chip in my mouth, I lifted my hand and told him, \"I think those are mine\", he then approached me and said, \"You couldn't have told me these were yours??\"    So, first of all - it's not my job to know what the server has in his hand, second, it's not my job to keep track of the server or my order, and let him know where Im sitting.  I have never had this issue before.  I have always had great service.  Im also a person that can take a joke and am aware enough to know when someone is joking, but he was pretty irritated.  Then to top things off, apparently the bartender, Dani, called him over to go over a procedure with him, and his comment back to her was, \"you called me over here to tell me that?\"  That was enough to solidify that he speaks this way and it's his personality.    This won't stop me from going to Chili's because I've been a customer for so long and love most of the staff - Dani and Sheena specifically, but this could effect new customers and does leave a bad overall experience for the customer."}
{"text":"I've been in the restaurant to eat several times as well as ordered out and never really had an issue with service or the food.   But, tonight, my boyfriend and I decided to order some dessert to pick up. We ordered the chocolate chip cookie skillet and the brownie skillet. When my boyfriend picked it up and got it home, the cookie and the brownie were cold, as in pulled out of the fridge. How hard is it to make fresh brownies and cookies? They tasted like very prepackaged and processed stuff you can buy at the store. I don't expect gourmet but it is a restaurant, so I would expect a majority of items to be made fresh. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Always good service, great food usually little to no wait even on Fridays and Saturdays, the only reason it's not 5 stars is the takeout portion sometimes gets orders wrong, and or gives you cold food so if you order take out make sure you double check the order"}
{"text":"Did the $20/2. Chips and salsa good. Wife had vegetarian fajita which she enjoyed.  The pico de gallo was a little heavy on cilantro but overall good food.  I had the Parmesan crusted steak medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  Great cut. Broccoli was a little dry.  Water didn't taste that good. Friendly staff, but new waiter forgot to box up wife's leftover.  He offered to have them cook up a portion for her to take. We accepted."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! There's only a few options in this area for food but the staff is always wonderful no matter what time of day you go in. The booths are very clean.. The food and drinks are great!"}
{"text":"Flight was 4 hours late so we watched the Wild game here. Bartender and servers were super friendly but I paid $24.00 for 2 Stella's and $7.00 for a basket of chips and salsa. My hubby had an omelet and it was typical airport quality."}
{"text":"Would be one star if it wasn't for Gail our server. Let's get it together here people, common sense tells me sitting 2 cops beside a couple enjoying a few adult beverages is an immediate buzz kill. Sending a socially awkward manager around around that ask 2 tables out of six in the area how they are doing...well what's the point? I use term \"manager\" loosely bc he never introduced himself, had no name tag & frankly looked like bum in his stripped shirt. Step it up Chilies...will update next visit"}
{"text":"Sanitation grade was a 91.5 so we left,  we normally check and give the benefit of doubt if it is at least an A but if it's that low then the people working/making your food don't really care enough to ensure your well being.  McDonald's has a better sanitation grade...  Now that's saying something!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a very generous one star because there's no option to give them any less all the food tasted frozen not fresh very unappealing and I had to run the waitress down every single time I wanted a refill will not be back very disappointing"}
{"text":"Definitely a spot to cool down from this Vegas heat.  I have only been to Chili's a handful amount of times, and this is probably the reason why. Service was always slacking whether it was to ask a question or just receive a simple refill. Our waiter/waitress did not hesitate to happily pass us back and forth.   They offer a little touchscreen/tablet for ordering and playing games which is very convenient, especially when you are with kids who cannot seem to calm their loud mouths down.  Must admit, there is not many places where you can have a nice sit down dinner for two and pay around $20. Although, some of the plates do come well underdressed unlike the pictures on the menu and are never really filling either. A quesadilla that I ordered came out looking like a kids meal, and had a salad on a different day which both had that pre grilled/diced frozen chicken. On top of that, make sure you occupy yourself for a about an hour while they take their time catching and prepping our meals.  Overrated from my personal view. Do not expect much high quality of anything here besides the cold refreshing A/C. I'll stick more with the apples and the bees:)"}
{"text":"When leaving Vegas, you usually are in desperate need of a greasy meal and that is why Chili's Too @ The Vegas Airport is AWESOME!   I ordered some sort of burger... It was not memorable so probably not the best of burgers... but I needed fatty, greasy food and that is what it was so it was good enough. If I had to rate the burger by itself, it would probably get a two and I probably wouldn't have even taken the time to write a review but I am here writing a review and that is because our server Val was such a nice, attentive, smiley lady and even though I was sad to leave Vegas, she lifted my spirits.    Val is 5 stars! I ordered a diet coke and she brought me two big mugs of it. She smiled and she let us know how long the food would take to cook. She was just such a nice lady and that is why Chili's Too gets 5 stars.   I feel that great customer service has become a rarity in this world so I'm here to say \"Thanks Val for brightening my day and dining experience with your great smile.\""}
{"text":"Not the best customer service and the food was horrible . I would have been better off with a bag of chips and a candy bar. Orange juice tasted like mountain run off on ice. Waiter seemed uninterested and I had to go to the bar to get a table. I'll avoid next time."}
{"text":"It seems like they are always very busy here when we show up.    Typical Chilis, food is alright, service could be faster but it's standard for a big chain."}
{"text":"Thursday night around 8 PM. We sat at the bar. Tyler (if i remember correctly) was tending.  Two Dos Equis Ambers for us. I got the buffalo chicken ranch sandwich and he got the Smokehouse Burger.  Tyler suggested the burger be topped with a Pretzel Bun. We decided to go crazy and do Pretzel on both.  The bun on the bottom of the burger was a little over toasted (dry-esq), but not worth complaint.  Everything was good overall.  In and out in about 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Food was ok but I experienced better. Burgers have to eaten with fork and knife because a large amount of sauce was all over it and bun turns to slop. I actually was still hungry afterwards. Deserts are limited to cakes at 1000+ calories. Parking lot exit has a huge crater that will swallow up your car."}
{"text":"Moving now to Las Vegas coming from Miami, I decided to become part of chilis family by visiting the restaurant every Saturday night to have dinner with my other half. One of the reason why I come to this particular restaurant is because my server Jessica, she is the best server ever. Extremely professional, well manner and fun. This place wouldn't be the same without her. So now, you may ask why one star, today 8/12/2017 at 12:15am, I ordered the usual, quesadilla explosión salad. When I started eating my salad I found GRASS in between. It was gross!!! I called my server she helped immediately but when the Manager Scott or scooter came to my table he had a nasty attitude like if I wanted something for free. So long story short, the manager asked me, is there something wrong? When I replied, well I found grass in my salad. When scoot or scooter replied to me EAT IT, it's just grass that happened when they cut the salad. Like I said, I wasn't expecting anything for free, just an apology would have made the difference. I did ate part of the salad because I didn't wanted to make an scene, and my server was nice enough that i felt sorry returning the salad and then maybe she had to pay for it. Based on this experience I will not stop coming here, due to the fact that she is the most amazing person and human being. She makes feel like back home (MIAMI). I will expect a response from the general manager Mikey Beals. Behaviors like this from SCOTT or Scooter are not professional at all. He is not dealing with bulgar person. I am well educated to behave in such situations. Once again just an apology would have made a big different...."}
{"text":"Went to this Chilis on Saturday at 8. Only had to wait 5 minutes. Which was the only good part of the time there. I ordered the queso dip with a side of ranch. 10 minutes later the chips arrived but no queso or ranch. Instead there was salsa. The sever said the queso would be out shortly. I reminded her of the ranch. She so oops I forgot it, let me go grab it for you. Another 15 minutes goes by and finally the queso comes out. Again I ask for some ranch.... 5 minutes later it finally comes. During this whole time I am with out a drink. I ended up having a different server get me a drink. Now when the entrees come out mine is literally dropped right infront of me hard enough that it CRACKED THE PLATE!!! The plate itself was greasy and you could see it was wiped with a dirty towel. After this I was not happy. I asked to speak with a manager... No manager ever came. \"They were busy in the kitchen\" we were told. After this experience I will not go back to this Chilis... horrible service and sub par food."}
{"text":"I used to love this Chili's and thought for a long time they differentiated themselves from the other chain restaurants but in recent visits their menu options have changed and there's really nothing on the menu that interests me anymore.  The hostess at lunch is the high point of my recent visits.  She is always friendly and if you are dining alone, she asks if you want a paper to read while you wait.  The wait staff is hit or miss here, like most chain restaurants.  Most are there just for a paycheck and really could care less if they give good service or not.  What a shame.   I stopped coming here because of these reasons.  Maybe if Chili's changes their menu again to appeal to me, I may return but for now, no."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Chili's in a while but they updated their menu and have good drink prices. This particular location has good customer service so far but the food took a while when I only ordered apps."}
{"text":"Waited 10 mins to get seated at 3:00 in the afternoon... like 5 tables were sat so they weren't busy.... ordered our drinks. Took 15mins to be told \"the keg is foaming\" .... like wtf no, you don't know how to pour it honey. I work at a bar, if the keg foams. Why did someone install it incorrectly and why aren't they fixing it?  Pathetic service. Just walked out on that bullshit didn't even order."}
{"text":"Maybe the WORST service ever!! If there was a manager in the restaurant his presence on the floor was NON existent. Would NEVER go back"}
{"text":"Server was nice. Natalie was her name. Food came out cold. When we let our server know she apologized and went to get her Manager. The Manager was a joke! Daniel Was his name. He came to our table and asked what was going on. I explained to him that our food came out cold. He turned towards my husband and said what did you order? Let me go check on it. No apology....What a shame that you have someone like him with absolutely no guest service. He is supposed to set the example.... At least Natalie had awesome customer service. You guys must have changed your Managers. I have never been to any one of you guys restaurants and served luke warm food.He did not even come back to check on our table. It wasn't even busy. Smh he just did not care. Teach your employees that the guest are the ones who keep the business running."}
{"text":"When I was in college I dined at Chili's often - often enough to have sampled almost everything on their menu. I hadn't been in awhile, but all the staples are still there - out-of-control burgers with lots of toppings, the ribs, a few scatterings of fish dishes, one pasta dish, and of course, the appetizers and my favorite - the chicken crispers.   This Chili's was super packed when my boyfriend and I showed up on a Friday night. Luckily, we were able to snag a two-person booth quicker than the said wait-time of 25 minutes (yikes!). Anyway, we were seated and greeted by our waitress who was pleasant, but seemed a bit overrun and busy. However, being a Friday night at Chili's what else is there to expect? I ordered a Stella and a water, while my boyfriend went for a Sam Adams draft.  For some reason there wasn't much on the menu that was enticing me. I thought about going for the ribs, but ended up ordering a new addition to the menu, a twist on the chicken crispers - honey chipotle chicken crispers. Well, this item was somewhat of a let-down. The crispers were much more sweet than I imagined them to be. I was thinking something with a spicy kick, but not so. Of course they gave me a heaping amount of fries and the corn on the cob, which was good.  My boyfriend's fajitas looked much better than my meal. He got the trio, with shrimp, chicken, and steak. I did try a few bites, and the shrimp was a tad over-cooked, but the chicken and steak were very good.  Overall this place is great for families (there was even a person running around making balloon animals) and it's just like any other typical Chili's. I found no huge problems with the service or the food, but it's simply another neighborhood Chili's."}
{"text":"Today, I had THE WORST service experience at Chilis on Stapley and the 60. Usually, we have no problems, but tonight it was exceptionally bad. Customer service? There was none. David (bartender) and his partner were extremely rude. It took forever to bring out our drinks. I had to ask for the same thing multiple times. They never stopped and checked on us to see how we were doing or if needed anything. Also, my food had a hair in it. Gross!!! Food took forever to be re made. Manager did apologize, but our servers had no idea what was going on because they never checked on us. In the end, the girl server tried to be nice but it only came across as fake because it was right before I was about to sign the receipt. Overall, completely terrible. I will never come back there again."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Chips were way too salty. We waited an hour for our food and everything we ordered came out cold. The waitress never came to check on us. We were never asked if we wanted refills on our drinks. The waitress asked how our food was and I replied \"cold\" and she said \"oh good\" and walked away. It took 30 minutes for our dessert to come out. By far the worse service I've ever had. If I could rate them zero stars I would. But shout out to the hostess she was the only one that seemed to do her job right."}
{"text":"Decent food and great management who always make things right when they do go wrong. I like this restaurant. I took one star off because the French fries are not always consistent as are some of the servers."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Chili's in Las Vegas/North Las Vegas. By far, this was the best service I've ever had at any I've been too. Our server, Avi, was extremely helpful, seeing as I have some complicated dietary restariants. She took them all in stride and made this visit excellent.  100%, we will be back."}
{"text":"OK, this is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants & this location is the one I've visited the most.  I'm a big fan of the chicken crispers & usually this is the meal I get. I know it's a really unhealthy meal, especially the ones coated in sauce, but they're just so good. The atmosphere at any Chili's is the same, being a family friendly place that's usually pretty noisy.  This location is always packed during dinner hours, but if you can catch a seat in the bar area, then you can bypass the wait most of the time. The bar area here can get cramped though, especially if you have a group of 4 or more.  I love Chili's even though it's a chain & that I get the same meal every time I go there."}
{"text":"My family only goes to Chiles when we have a gift card because it is simply not worth the money. Almost any other restauraunt serves better food for the same price. One time when we came into this location we were served water that had a ton of bugs frozen into the ice. We told the waitress before walking out and she was apologetic and confirmed our experience. About a year after this incident we got another gift card and decided to give this location another chance. That was a big mistake. I ordered the cheeseburger thinking that it is a simple item that would be difficult to mess up. I was wrong! I couldn't taste the meat or anything else on the burger because each bite that I took tasted entirely like a mouth full of straight dill. I don't want any dill on my burger, let alone such a huge overpowering amount. Dill wasn't even listed on the menu for this burger or I would have NEVER even ordered  it. It is pathetic that somebody who cooked this meal is calling themselves a \"chef.\" The same \"chef\" also served us a plate of fried zucchini that included a bunch of random bits of random items that were apparently thrown into the frier and put on the plate. My wife bit into a piece of fried garlic when we were supposed to be eating a plate of fried zucchini. I will never be back to this location or ANY other Chiles location due to the terrible service we have consistently received here after giving this location a chance every couple of years. I would hope that this restaurant has got better since the few months that I have been here, but I honestly doubt that this place will ever get better. This place should be shut down."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Excepted my service dog with love and attention. Highly recommend coming here, all staff was very very friendly."}
{"text":"Order took over 1 hour for our food. They brought our dessert first before the meal. It happens everytime we come here. Food was burnt and didnt taste good. Beware about leaving tips they will change the amount."}
{"text":"I'm giving away a secret.   They have some strange deal here where you buy a beer and get two free shots. Yes, you read that right. Good shots. Do I want a shot, much less 2, while shopping at Concord Mills mall? No, not really. HOWEVER, this comes in handy during the chaos of the holiday season. It is a ridiculous deal. It should be illegal. It is not. I think you have to order at the bar to get this. I have also heard that the airport Chili's Too has the same ridiculous deal.  Mind you, I cannot get them 5 stars because I refuse to eat the food. It is soooooo gross."}
{"text":"I took my family for dinner last night and it was one of the best experiences we had. It all started with our super awesome server Amanda, who introduced herself to us, was very friendly, helpful and took great care of us. My wife and kids are vegetarian, so she suggested some great options for them from the menu and even off the menu. The food was really good as well. Even the Manager, Tiffany was very helpful and accommodating. We had a great experience, I signed up for the rewards program because I will definitely be going there more often. The only thing which I did not like was that the temperature setting of the air conditioner was too low which made it very cold inside. But that's something they can easily fix if we talk to them. Overall wonderful place and employees. Must try."}
{"text":"Came in alone on a kid less night , to get away. Wanted a quiet dinner with a beer so I sat at the bar. Couples with kids were seating after I ordered on  both sides of me. Why is that allowed at a bar?  I've been turned away with a child at other restaurants for trying to sit at dining tables in those places. Steak ordered medium which says just pink came out red, blood all over the plate. Forks worn down wouldn't stab the food, and took a while to order even tho only couple other at the bar at the time. They were also missing 3 big tvs from the walls at the bar which was part of my reason for coming into the bar by myself. Bar tender said they didn't know what happened to them."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!!! Horrible!!!!! Horrible!!!!!! I placed an order online at 6:45pm and selected pick up time to be 7:30pm. I get there at 7:30pm and the girl at the counter doesn't acknowledge me! Finally 10 minutes later I ask her what's going on with my order and \"she can't find it!\" (Mind you, I just overheard her telling the person before me that they messed up her online order as well). She then tells me to \"Wait!\" while she straightens out the other orders. 20 minutes later she realizes that's my order sitting on the counter. I live 15 minutes away and I'm pretty positive that the food will be rubbery by the time I get home since it's been almost an hour since the order was completed! If I hadn't already paid online and already wasted an hour of wait time to feed my kids, I would've went to TGIF! Their burgers are better anyway!! Very disappointed in the service I got tonight!! Glad it wasn't my husband picking up, who is a Vet here on Veterans Day!"}
{"text":"Chilis is Chilis when it comes to the food selection and prices.  What I wanted to talk about was the service.  I order fajitas which is NBD, but Bae ordered a steak.  They asked him THREE times to cut his steak and check if it was cooked right.  For starters, you should have more faith that your chef knows what medium-rare is.  Secondly, let me cut my steak when I'm ready.  I think they did that so they didn't have to come back to our table for a while, because our server disappeared after he declined to cut the steak the third time.  Of course when he finally did, it was medium-well.  But, OMG, get the toffee brownie sundae.  We got ours to-go because we were stuffed, but it was amazing reheated.  I can only imagine how good it is in a warm skillet."}
{"text":"It took us well over two hours to eat dinner because the kitchen was SO SLOW.  I would be fine with that, except the restaurant was less than half full.  Couldn't quite grasp what the hold up was."}
{"text":"In the interest of being truthful, the only reason I continue to go to this restaurant is because my kid loves it. With that being said, my last two experiences have been pretty poor.  A few weeks back, we had lunch there and I ordered the California club sandwich. The only special request I made is I asked to have the mayo on the side. I only like a little bit and they always put too much on.  Service is normally slow there, but I was prepared for this so no big deal. Unfortunately, when they brought my sandwich it had big sloppy globs of mayo on it.   Tried to get the waitress' attention but she didn't come back for a few minutes. Then by the time she brought the manager over and he offered to make me a new sandwich, we had to leave or be late to our next activity for the day. I scraped off what I could and ate some of the sandwich, but there was so much on there that it didn't do much good.  Tonight my son really wanted Chili's, so off we go. The restaurant was pretty busy so I was surprised when we were seated right away.  We sit about 10 minutes, two waitresses walk by and tell us they will be right with us. 15 minutes later we finally have drinks. (Like I said, service is almost always slow here so I was not upset by this at the time)  We all placed our orders at the same time. I ordered the 6 oz sirloin with grilled avocado, medium. 15 minutes later my husband and son's food comes out. \"Wow, we are getting served really fast!\" I just assumed that she didn't have enough hands for mine and would be right back   10 minutes later I still don't have my food, and the servers are nowhere to be found. Finally our server walks past or table and my husband grabs her, pointing out that I still have not gotten my order. She apologizes and goes back to check on it.   20 more minutes go by and now we are short on time because we have a birthday party to go to. The server finally brings out my food. The steak was not only rare, but it was cold in the middle.   So now my plan for a nice family dinner is ruined, my husband and son are finished with their meals and watching me eat mine, except I can't eat a rare steak. I can't send it back because we are out of time.   Now I work in customer service, so I was calm and polite throughout the whole process. What REALLY finally got to me is that our original server refused to come back to our table. She sent her coworker over to check on us and walked by our table like nothing happened.  The only positive thing is that is did speak to the manager and she was very apologetic. I told her that I was trying to be patient because I knew they were busy, but she said they were properly staffed for the crowd and it shouldn't have happened. We offered to pay for husband and son's meal, but she comped the whole thing.  So I spent almost 2 hours at Chili's and left hungry."}
{"text":"Amazing location on the strip w great view. Plenty of seating w tons of TVs. Our service was a little off but it was late n servers were probably tired. Had the fajitas n they gave me some hard cold cheese n then overcharged us but corrected the error. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great experience - Loyda (Lois) was our server and we were extremely pleased. My wife and I come to this location very often and we're constantly let down with the cleanliness and/or the lack of service but she definitely changed our mind. Fill out their survey at the end and make sure you give her a huge thumbs up because supposedly their schedules depend on that -__- Step your game up Chilis, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard"}
{"text":"Did not have a good experience at this chili's. First, when we sat down two women were cleaning the table behind us and loudly said \"there were two grown a** adults sitting here how can it be this messy\" while grunting and complaining the whole time Then we ordered table side guacamole, first he brought the chips and told us the guacamole would be right out, it probably took 15 more minutes then he brought us a bowl of avocados and the sides and told us to \"have a go at it\", telling us he has never made the guacamole before so we have to do it. Overall the service was horrible, and the food was okay. I definitely would not go back."}
{"text":"Living in Scottsdale there are endless choices of where to get food from. Chili's has a nice menu and reasonable prices. I always order online togo food. They are good about the time estimates and they usually do a good job of quality control to make sure you get what you order.   Last time I ordered I was missing 1/2 of the bun on a bacon cheese burger. It was a major/stuck to the paper mess.   Over all Chilis is an ok deal and very convenient if you like to order online and not have to get out of your car to pick up food."}
{"text":"This Chili's has been a mainstay in our family's dining options ever since our youngest found their ribs.    Tonight we went to celebrate his report card and he of course ordered the ribs.  I ordered the Rib Eye and a side of grilled shrimp.  I have ordered these grilled shrimp before and they are usually large and nice.  The waiter, who announced to us that this was his last night of training, brought us our food, sans the shrimp.  I was told that it was just taking a little longer.    Another 5 minutes later, and they presented me with a plate with 5-6 TINY and I mean TINY shrimp.  Nothing else.  No rice, no skewer, though these were so small they would never had fit on a skewer.  These were popcorn shrimp, and they wanted to charge me $3.75 for half a dozen of them.    When I complained, the other waitress merely smiled and informed us that they had \"switched to the smaller ones\" and that they would take it off the bill.   It is do disappointing to see a restaurant that already charges $2.50 for a glass of tea, cut costs by turning a side item into a total joke."}
{"text":"Took my family of 5 to dinner on Memorial Day. Place was pretty empty. Waiter took our drinks, everything smooth. She finally took our order. Nearly an hour later we still didn't get our food. When she finally appeared I told her to cancel my order and then she said the food was coming up. First my sons food was cold, my food was bland and my husbands order was wrong. When she finally passed by he asked about it. Last time we went he got tenders and these were different. In a condescending tone she said well you got the original this time. At no time when she took the order did she ask what kind he wanted. We paid for our food and left. I don't recommend this chili's at all"}
{"text":"It's Chili's....  We tried their flatbread with the tomatoes and garlic aioli.  It was very good.  Nice and crispy.    Prices are good and staff is friendly.  I like that it has a bar to sit at.  The only negative was all the sodas/club sodas etc at the bar were flat.  The bartender had to go to the server station to get the fizzy water for our drinks."}
{"text":"Dirty floors and food everywhere on the floor.  Even the workers were slipping around.  It was hard to get someone's attention to take my to-go order even though the employees see you (look right through you).  The guy that eventually helped me was nice enough and he did check my order to make sure it was correct before I paid which is why they get the extra star.  I ordered the meat trio thing that I saw on a commercial.  Really bad and pretty inedible.  The meat was thin, tough and fatty.  I ended up throwing it away and making a sandwich.  Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Got a salad and my girl got the nachos .. amazing! The buffalo chicken sandwich I got was so burnt :( I was disappointed. It was a take out order. Everything else was very good though."}
{"text":"This is the best option in D terminal. Food was comparable to non-airport Chilis with lots of non-burger options. They have a electronic pager for the server, so you can reach you server for issues/check and they quickly respond.  Great for a sit down restaurant. A bit expensive (but hey, it is an airport).  Note: rating is based on other airport restaurant not non-airport restaurants, as that would be unfair."}
{"text":"Got there at dinner time, it wasn't really busy for being in the location it was.  Our waiter took awhile to come to the booth, when he did we ordered the chips & salsa along with the waters and that too \"took long to come\", at least 7 minutes.  When he came with the chips, we said we were ready to order, there were 3 of us.  We were alittle pressed for time, so this didn't help  We ordered pretty light as one of us had the Chicken enchilada soup (very good I might ad), the other a chicken quesadilla and the other person taco's.  Like I said it was not busy, we had already finished our chips & salsa dish and infact ordered another...NOTHING came for at least 15 or so minutes possibly more.  We asked numerous people at numerous times and they kept saying it was on its way?????????????  Finally our waiter brought the 2nd order of chips & salsa \"I said you must be the only waiter\", he thought I was attacking him and I was only asking to pretty much GIVE HIM THE EXCUSE...OF WHY THE H...IT TOOK SO LONG,NOW  we're ALL pretty PO'D by this time.  He knew we were upset, said he talked to the Ghost of a Manager, and she tried to appease us with dessert (we did not get any) or we probably would of been there till midnight waiting??  Have alot of time on your agenda when wanting to dine in at this location !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of those places with no drink prices on the menu... $8.89 for a margarita...? $15.79 for fajitas...No sides, no salad, no chips & salsa? Not worth it."}
{"text":"Great place for dessert. I tried shrimp pasta and was good, 7/10. Good place for friends.  Note that sometimes they charge 1.99$ randomly for table entertainment even you don't use the table tablet for games. So, double check on that in the receipt."}
{"text":"A trip to Chili's is always a good time. The menu selection and the service is consistently great!"}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time visiting this location and both times they have messed up my food. This visit I ordered the Caribbean salad without the bell peppers and my sons girlfriend ordered the same salad with the dressing on the side. She never got her dressing and my salad was literally a pile of lettuce with some chicken on the top. I had to ask for the remaining toppings and was told because they like to mix the toppings in the morning I didn't get them, so when I asked to omit one item I basically got none of them. The manager did go back and portion out the items missing while the rest of my party were eating their lunch. Although the servers and manager were nice about the situation I can't believe a cook would look at the same salad going to the same table and think it was ok. Also for some bizarre reason the water tasted like sanitizer and literally burned my mouth after the first sip, GROSS!! My husband went to the car and got my water bottle so I could have safe water to drink. When I informed the server she did bring out a water bottle for myself and husband. Over all it was extremely disappointing!!"}
{"text":"My grandparents and myself have been coming to this Chili's for a long time. We usually get the same meals and they really good.   I always end up getting the oldtimer burger and it always ends up being great.  We usually always get the molten chocolate cake and it's always heavenly.   The severs are amazing and their manager Ricardo is awesome as well!!!"}
{"text":"A good friend of mine from college comes to town every year with his family and we always try to get together when they are here. We always do lunch. I suggested Chili's as I had  been there for the first time in a couple of years a week before. Chili's has changed. Lots of menu items to choose from and the prices are reasonable. There were 4 adults and 2 kids in the party. I had the triple sampler, my friend and his wife have the 2 for $20.00 meals, his mother-in-law had a pasta dish and the kids had the kids meal. Everyone was pleased with their meal. I could not finish mind and we took 4 to go boxes with us. The server was friendly and attentive. There was a wait. We thought the lunch rush would be over by 1:00PM but actually it was pretty busy until 2:00 PM. I waited about 20 minutes but my friends were late so their wait was not very long. (They are always late) I recommend getting there after 2:00 PM during the week unless you are not in a hurry. No one is in a hurry in Vegas unless they are behind the wheel of a car. This location is near my office so I plan to get by there was a late lunch or after work."}
{"text":"We usually don't have any issues with Chili's, have been going to the one in Avondale for awhile now, but since they opened the one up on 75th Ave, we have been here twice.  The first time was at happy hour and it was good enough.  Last night we ordered what we order every time we visit a Chili's and that was chips & salsa, dinner salads, buffalo wings..  Well, my partner and I were sick all night, my stomach is still turning 18 hours later.  So disappointed, called there to tell them and the girl who answered just said oh sorry about that and hung up.  I didn't speak with a manager or if she was, then she didn't care that the food made us sick."}
{"text":"As big chilis fans, we just can't handle how the night went.  We hesitated eating in the bar dining area as the service is always bad.  Tonight was no exception.  Drink was totally wrong, food was cold and the \"is everything ok?\" check in happened 90% the way finished with our meal.   Even went as far as to take a picture of my plate vs the menu picture!  I know it never matches up but tonight's example I had to share!!!!  See pics!!"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch special w/bowl of chili. Received it luke warm. They did heat it up in microwave. Came out nice & hot. Rest of meal came out great. Waitperson was nice and attentive. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Came here this afternoon for one of my favorite places for chicken enchilada soup.  Also had a burger and so did my son, both were good.  This food is nothing special but it's nice to have consistency in these Chili chain restaurants, and the service here has always been good.  My wife is not a fan but she doesn't like chains period.  I wish there were more options in this area but Chili's will do for now.  I like the bar area and they have pretty good happy hour specials too if you need a place for a quick drink to meet some friends."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this Chili's! Service is great and food is even better. I usually sit in the lounge area with a few friends and Anthony is our bartender of choice! He never fails to make us laugh and serve us the best drinks around! I am a big fan of the margarita of the month The Cherry Blossom! Highly recommend you go in and sit at the bar because of their happy hour food deals. Almost every appetizer on the menu is half price if not cheaper and they are full portion sizes for most of them! Thank you for awesome service and a great time!"}
{"text":"I took my three teenagers here to meet my brother for lunch and celebrate May birthdays. We were seated promptly and Ethan was our server.  The restaurant was cool and clean. Drinks were served and refilled in a timely manner. The food and atmosphere was very tasty. Everyone enjoyed their food and drinks. Ethan was funny and helpful when we had questions about the menu. Overall, a good time. We will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service the food was trash compared to other Chili's I've been too, the only good thing was the waitress and It's not her fault that she has to be represented by a trash kitchen staff. The ribs were dry as hell!!!!! Fire the cook and get a new one ASAP."}
{"text":"Had to wait over one hour for food to come out once food came out food was ice cold Manager didn't have the common sense to even say sorry unfortunately his staff is good but he has no leadership poor customer service skills"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service, did not bus my table after eating, all of the servers were sitting with a friend at the table behind us talking loud, I even heard the male bartender telling his friend \"dude I partied so hard on Sunday that I had a dream I did Heroine for the first time and wasn't sure it if was real or a dream\""}
{"text":"Chili's has been one of are favorite places to dine. In fact it's been one of my top picks for years. However, the quality of the food, the taste today seriously was not good .After this visits but especially this last visit Chili's used to be one of my favorite places to dine. In fact it's been one of my top picks .I hope that it was this location just leaving Vegas their menu was not even as it was before .Less to choose from hope this is not the case with all of them ...."}
{"text":"We really enjoy eating at Chili's on the Las Vegas strip it's always super good food and the staff is very friendly very clean quiet never had a bad experience here usually eat here every time we come to Vegas so thanks for all the good food .."}
{"text":"I'm done with Chili's! Used to be the best but not anymore. There last evening, my margarita was way too salty in the mix itself, complained to waitress who said \"oh too bad\" had to ask her to replace it! My Cajun pasta came COLD & DRY, had to send back. My son had a burger who said yes to \"special sauce\" but no tomato when ordering. It came with tomato and no sauce!! Bottom line, service and food not good anymore which seems a pattern with all chili's I've tried in area lately! I'm moving on!!"}
{"text":"My experience at Chili's has an amazing distinction that I can't think of anything they did right.   - When I ordered Iced Tea to drink, the server asked if I wanted lemon. I said no. The Iced Tea was served with lemon anyway. It was only refilled once during the meal, and that was when I asked for a refill after the glass sat empty for a few minutes.  - I ordered chips and salsa, free with a Foursquare coupon. It appeared on the check (as did the coupon), but the chips and salsa was never delivered.  - I ordered a bacon burger without mayo. It was served with mayonnaise.  - At the end of the meal, it took several minutes after removing my plate to ask if I wanted dessert or my check, and then several more minutes to actually deliver the check.   They explained, both to me, as well as to another table that complained when the server shorted them $10 in change, that it was only the server's second day. Apparently she isn't ready, and should either be further trained, better supervised, or should find another job. As for me, this server cost this Chili's a customer... I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"They remodeled a while ago and changed up managers I believe. After all that, and changing their menu around, Chili's is once again a great place to eat and Applebees isn't even close. Granted, Chili's misses out a bit on appetizers but their redesigned chicken fingers and fajitas make it a thumbs up. The servers have improved as well. Give this place a try again and see what you think. Sunday--Happy Hour is all day so some great deals on appetizers."}
{"text":"Pretty good for lunch. It was super busy on a rainy Saturday afternoon. I ordered a Black bean burger w guacamole yummmmmmm!!! Came with seasoned fries which were just OK, the burger was so big you don't need any fries. My friend got a hamburger which she said was good as well. Fast and friendly service, no complaints here."}
{"text":"I got my fat girl life in this here Chili's today. Our waitreses (I can't think of her name) was amazing and very attentive. I made sure to do the survey after I paid and give her and the service high marks. The food was GOOD. That street corn tho!!!"}
{"text":"Chilis is going downhill with their choices. First they get rid of Caesar salads for the fresco salads, then they get rid of a rewards program that actually was good with a program that while adds more places (if you shop those places) but costs twice as much to get any rewards, and now they get rid of the 2 for $20. Instead of the 2 for $20 they have a new 3 for $10.99 which includes an app and a mini molten cake desert. While this is good for singles or good for couples that don't both want off the 2 for $20, this new program is far more expensive. Not only is it $1.98 more expensive off the bat, but under the apps it no longer allows chips and guacamole without a surcharge. It also costs a minimum $2 extra for the sirloin which used to fall under the 2 for $20. If a couple wants this deal, but only wants 1 app, you can't even combine to 2 apps to save the $2 guacamole charge even though they save an entire appetizer price. Also some entrees no longer come with all their sides that they use to (mango chili chicken no longer comes with rice). They do still have the 2 for $35 that covers the old 2 for $20 just with 2 margaritas  (if both are able to drink, ie not working later). Highly unlikely to return to chilis with how their decisions are going. Good budget dining this is not!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Burger Bites that were $10.29 and not worth a penny over $4.99.  They were merely grilled Kastle burgers (or burgers made with store bought dinner rolls that come in a pack from the bread aisle). Maybe I am asking too much but when you ask for sliders you should get a decent made hamburger with a mini hamburger bun.  Also, do not try to use coupons from Retail Me Not, they do not accept them. They are not owned by Chili's.    Undecided whether I am going back, should I have to call and ask if they are owned by Chili's and whether they take coupons when they are so many other places to eat.  Options.....probably not."}
{"text":"What can you say about Chili's.  The food is good no matter what you order.  This is a chain and I have never had a bad meal at this place.   You can feel safe eating here at this location anytime."}
{"text":"Although the food was good and the service was great be aware of those little computers they put on your table. My friend started playing one of the games and he did not realize it was going to charge him $.99. They did take it off the bill but how about a little warning before you charge someone to play games on the thing you put on the table?"}
{"text":"Great food. Clean. Diana was really great & friendly,,, on the ball. There were 20 people with my group & we had separate checks and had no problems. Very accommodating."}
{"text":"I dont make it up to this chili's very often, nor have I been to one in a while. They have a new set of margarits that were great!! I wish they would bring back the buffalo sliders, but the regular sandwich is just as tasty!"}
{"text":"Rather than drone on about the bad things, the good things were:  - The waiter kept the drinks (diet coke) full - The waiter, albeit a bit all over the place, was generally a very nice guy. - The French fries I had with my hamburger were really good.  I've found that I goto chilis when,  - There isn't anyplace else around - My wife makes me(*)  meh...its Chilis. Everyone knows what to expect there and this was the usual experience. Not great but also not bad.   * This was why I was there this evening."}
{"text":"This Chili's location has pretty good service, except if you sit in the bar area. I always feel like the bartender and the waitresses are spread too thin, and service can get a little slow and suffer because of it. Tables are cleared off very slowly, and I've been instructed not to sit down until they are clean. So we are left standing there for quite a while.  Granted it's probably not all their fault if they are scheduled thin to begin with so we don't really hold it against them. We've always been treated nice and they have been very pleasant. The food is generally pretty consistent and we come here often."}
{"text":"Margarita Chicken Salad and the Beef Enchiladas are great!! Alex our waiter was very good and attentive, thanks a lot."}
{"text":"love the food and the service is always good and the kids love the mini pads they let you play on ."}
{"text":"An okay place - not the cleanest and my food here is always cold or not cooked properly. Desserts are the best here!"}
{"text":"Yup just your average neighborhood Chilli's. A vast menu full of Tex mex goodies. My boyfriend and I came on a Friday for their bottomless soup, salad and chips & salsa on a Friday afternoon. You can't go wrong with bottomless for under $8.   The food was average, but good. My favorite soup was the chicken enchilada. I tried the loaded potato as well, but it was waaaay too cheesy for me. The chips & salsa were a must. Super thin crispy chips and delicious salsa, all the yes.   Service wise this location was a bit slow and seemed to be under staffed. Our server when she was around was super friendly though. Overall I'd be back again, decent & cheap food."}
{"text":"If you're not a fan of Chili's bottomless chips & salsa you're lying to yourself. Sometimes some easy, cheap chain restaurant food is all you really want after a long road trip.   A few of us stopped in on a Friday night and were quickly seated. This location looked like it had recently been remodeled to a move modernized look which I was digging. The service was quick and friendly and the food was pretty good.  To start we shared the chips and salsa which is always a must in my book. I had the smoked chicken quesadilla entree, but switched out the chicken for shrimp instead due to my recent pescatarian diet. The portion size was huge and taste was decent, but it was missing some type of much needed sauce for dipping. For a drink I had the pineapple blueberry margarita, very good & refreshing.  Overall it was an enjoyable dinner. Simple & easy."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service!  Sunday evening at 6pm.  The had an entire section closed.  Took 30 minutes after we were seated to get drinks.  No refills.  No silverware!   The waitress brings us 4 forks on a plate.  There were 6 of us.   No napkins.  1 + hour on food and the fries were cold when we got them.   I will not visit this location again."}
{"text":"Dirty floors, seated me (alone) near tables with screaming kids.  Waited 20 minutes so far for a flatbread pizza   Tea is all but tasteless.  Flatbread is goo but greasy. My waiter however was excellent and very gracious"}
{"text":"Getting ready to leave on a flight home the next morning, we would get a small snack and drink at Chili's which was located a block from our hotel.  Have gone to our neighborhood's Chili's which I consider just an average restaurant.  We sat in the bar area.  It was just before 4 pm and the waitress came back and said that it was Happy Hour and the appetizers were $4.99.  We ordered 2 - one flat bread pizza and some kind of nachos.  I was surprise of the size of the plates.  We were totally satisfied.   The service and 2 of the staff we dealt with were so nice.  Can pay electronically from the table which we really liked.  Highly recommend for a snack or bar drink."}
{"text":"This is the worst Chili's that I have ever been to, and I like the chain. I have not had even a single visit without some kind of problem. Including bugs in my food. I highly recommend that this chili's be avoided!! I would give it no stars if I could."}
{"text":"We waiting 20 mins, no one even came to offer us water. We decided to leave and as we were walking out there was  about 4 waitress's chit-chatting. We avoid other restaurants around the area because service sucks, this restaurant is now included in the list!"}
{"text":"we had some apps for lunch they were pretty good I like that little machine at the table dont have to wait for the bill service was good they checked up on us and the food came out fast we always have a great time there"}
{"text":"We have been coming here about once a month for a year and was curious how they rated on Yelp. So I was shocked when I saw 2.5 stars. We have had what I would rate as 4.5-5 star experiences every time we came.  The food is good to great depending on what we order. My wife and I have never had any food item that wasn't at minimum good. They did bring me a glass of tea once, when I actually ordered water, but big deal. Easy fix. I'm guessing the reason for the low ratings are actually a result of this Chillis location not paying their Yelp bill. Yelp bill you may ask? Yes. Pay your membership fee or have your good and great reviews marked as spam and not shown. This is why I usually don't bother with Yelp as it is simply a way to extort money from businesses. So, in order to not have my review marked as spam I am giving the Chillis location 4 stars, if I give them 5 stars Yelp won't publish this review."}
{"text":"We were at the location an hour and a half before happy hour ended, of course bar area was full there was a 25 minute wait, we had 4 kids with us so had to take first available or continue to wait for the bar area as the manager on duty Theresa would only honor happy hour in the bar area, she did offer us to get up from our table we waited on for 25 minutes and continue to wait, that was very thoughtful of her in probably the nicest way she could muster her response without a smile on her face, I believe I barely got my question out before \"no\" came out of her mouth. Not such great customer service from an MOD,  next time you have a 6 person table and you know the customer has waited and spending a decent amount of money on the dinner at least say no with a smile on your face and positive attitude. Our server Aaron on the other hand was great and made the rest of the visit enjoyable, maybe they should trade positions."}
{"text":"Did I just give Chili's four stars?  Yes, I did. And I'd do it again! I'd do it again!  Why?   Because of the El Presidente margarita.   And that's my only reason."}
{"text":"Great service and the waiter was always checking on us never had to look around for service. They use these new computers at your tables to order drinks, food, desserts etc. It was nice being able to press a button and have a drink refill within seconds. You can also pay your bill from the tablet at your table no need to wait for a check and them to return your slip and card to sign. Oh and they hooked it up on chips and salsa to go!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great Chili's location. yhe highest rating I could give any chili's is a three and they get it. Hostesses, waitstaff and manager were extraordinarily committed to making sure they understood what we wanted and that it was perfectly executed. It's worthy of recognition, so I wanted to share it. A very well-run place!"}
{"text":"You pretty much know what you're getting when you eat at Chilis...but my problem was with the service.  I am not a needy patron, but our drinks were never refilled and our waitress was crazy rude! It took forever to get our food and even longer to get the check.  We said we'd never to back, and we haven't! Horrible service!"}
{"text":"Terrible service from this location. No one put in our appetizer order that we immediately gave to one of our 3 servers that was supposedly \"taking care\" of us. After waiting close to 20 minutes, our daughter's meal came out which we ordered with our dinners well after the appetizer. We ordered, onion strings and jalapeños so we knew even with a backed up kitchen, there's no way it would take that long for our appetizer. At this point, we didn't want our dinners sitting under heat lamps for 15 more minutes while they try to make us an appetizer. We had our 3rd server who claimed to also be \"talking care\" of us check on the food situation, and he let us know that one of the servers must have forgotten to enter our appetizer since it wasn't in the system at all.  We made sure to cancel that order. Then the first server, the one who neglected to put our order in correctly in the first place, had the nerve to come tell us that she will make sure that the appetizer does not go on our bill. Like we were going to pay for food we never received. The rest of the food came out, just a couple burgers. It was decent, consistent chili's quality. At least the kitchen was doing their job correctly. Not once during our dinner were we checked on. We even had an EMPTY beer and margarita and we were not offered or asked if we wanted another round or asked how our food was. Plus the server looked so inconvenienced when we asked for the check. We are not picky or rude people, so I really do not understand the horrible service.... I am in the service industry and even waited tables in the past, and I would never even imagine giving a guest as horrible of an experience as we received at this particular Chili's. Save your money, do not go to this location. There are  plenty of other food options near the Chandler mall.  Advice for Chili's: 2-3 servers  for one table is excessive and unnecessary. Someone drops the ball at some point, which clearly happened on this occasion. The guest ends up with a terrible experience which they tell all their friends and Yelp about.... And your 3 servers get to share a NOT so generous tip."}
{"text":"Real bad experiance...feel like its a rip off. They're food is frozen."}
{"text":"Food is very consistent,  executed well.  Restaurant is clean.  Staff is polite and nice.  Price is good for quality."}
{"text":"To start, the A/C was out, but we weren't informed of that until we ordered and were sweating by that time. To follow that, the waiter kept calling me 'buddy' throughout the entire meal, which is patronizing. The seat was ripped open, and the walls were dirty with splattered food. Once the food was served the chicken fajita was uncooked, under seasoned, and flavorless. The big mouth bites were also undercooked, the burgers were pink through the middle. Other than these things, the buffalo chicken wings were excellent, the chips and salsa were to die for, and the smokehouse combo was great!"}
{"text":"Very very typical Chilis.  I've been here quite a few times. If you're looking for something low-calorie, I would not come here.  They have a pretty good selection, and I really loved their onion strings they used to have. There were a few occasions where my fiance and I just went to this location for that appetizer.  The service has been good every time we've been! I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"What a truly terrible experience. Our server was inattentive and slow, our food just plain wretched...who serves fajitas that aren't freaking sizzling? My husband said his crispy chicken tenders seemed like they were microwaved and not fried....  If he had known I was displeased or vice versa, we would have said something then and there, but alas, we didn't know until we were talking after. We chose Chili's as a safe bet.   I guess there's no such thing as safe.   So when Mickey and Mooch - shoot, when Qdoba - is next door, why the heck would you bother with this dump?"}
{"text":"Chilis is the greatest chain restaurant of all time (as well as Cheesecake Factory) and this location is no exception. Nice work Chilis."}
{"text":"Ordered southwestern egg rolls as a take out order.   There is day and night difference between the two franchise chili's locations for the same order. We always go to chili's on university ave and we always used to order egg rolls and they are delicious, so put in the same order.  The same order at paradise valley location was fat egg rolls with sour taste and with no flavor. Just change the chef and learn how to do properly and train the chefs first.  Below are pics for same order u guys decide.  Never going to this location again."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for years, everything's always been good and fresh. As of a  couple years ago I began to think their standards had gone down a little so I started going to their Decatur location and even there it wasn't the greatest.      Within the past 6-7 months we've ordered through a third party for delivery from this location twice, and I've been pleasantly surprised. Everything is how I remember it and I didn't think their food quality had gone down like it had before.       For lunch we ordered the Triple Dipper with mini sliders, southwestern eggs rolls and chicken crispers ($11.99), an order of southwestern eggrolls ($8.69), a basket of garlic toast ($1.99), loaded white queso ($7.49) and their Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers with a side of loaded mashed potatoes and street corn ($10.69).  The order arrived super early and the food was very fresh. Everything tasted like it should have and the quality was there. The only thing I would complain about was their street corn which was another $1.00 extra. It did not have a lot of flavor. They definitely have my returning business again."}
{"text":"I'm a regular of chili's but not this location it was actually my first time there. We went at opening and the waiter forgot our appetizer we had to flag someone anyone down for a drink... It was busy but not that busy.. The service was awful. I'll stick to my regular location from now on."}
{"text":"It's chili's and we been here numerous times, the hostess she sat us down wasn't rude but wasn't what you expect as a hostess I don't even think she smiled. Our waitress was nice, we ordered their new dish of ribs with street corn and bread with jalapeño sausage. The food overall was good. There was a female manager who was really nice and attentive to everyone, I mean she was really on top of things which I think was cool and her staff should follow suit which I can't say they didn't but really had nothing on her. We like the food, we can usually get in and out with no wait so it's kind of like an old reliable for us, so of course we will be back."}
{"text":"My, how I loathe chain restaurants. But sometimes, you are stuck eating at them bc it's a group decision. I ordered the sweet & spicy chicken served with rice and steamed broccoli. This is one of their \"lighter choices\" coming in at 590 calories... there's a reason for that. It's a small meal portion-wise with a noticeably small chicken breast. I easily cleared the plate.   The service here was spotty - took about 2 hrs for 3 of us to be served (no app or dessert). I guess if you're eating out, order something more fun. This leaves you unfulfilled."}
{"text":"Woah, Chili's .  Not your usual.. Called to order ToGo... Customer service on the phone : lackluster.  Decided to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"As casual, mid-level (does that make sense...and/or sound horrible), dining establishments go I don't mind Chili's (it's certainly better than AppleBee's).  I guess the best way to describe Chili's (or at least separate it from the other places that our similar) is that they put a \"Southwest\" twist on typical casual dining food.   I hadn't been to Chili's in a LONG time (I live in San Francisco and I couldn't even tell you the closest one to me), but I used to go every now and then when living in AZ, and even think I had been to this one when Riverview first opened.  Part of the reason I'm giving this Chili's 4 stars is because when I was here with my family recently we had excellent, prompt service. Our waiter was extremely friendly, and even gave us to-go cups for our drinks when we left without even asking him to do so. Also, I don't know if this is a new thing at Chili's, but we were given free chips & salsa like you get at a lot of Mexican restaurants (I noticed if you check in on foursquare this offer is made, but I didn't even bring it up).   As far as the food goes I ordered the honey Chipotle chicken tenders w/fries & corn on the cob and it was good. Everyone who I dined with was satisfied w/there meals as well. It doesn't hurt that the food at Chili's is pretty cheap compared to other places that serve similar food.  I know some people hate on places like Chili's because they're so commercial (and I'll admit...I can be one of them), but this place is pretty legit and I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill .they can't ever seem to get the steaks cooked right. Asked for medium got them medium rare. Ask for the steak on  my fajitas to be well done that also came out medium rare. It's been about 15 min and my replacement fajitas are still not here. No response from the manager no sorry no nothing .the manger on duty was joey"}
{"text":"Ok so, me and my wife have not eaten at this Chili's for quite some time because of past problems with the same location. Anyways we thought we would try it again because we were hungry and on we were close. It was lunch time and we walked in there was literally only 1 bartender/server we saw serving the bar area she had to seat us next to a party of like 12. So we sat down in the dinning room area and our server came out now the guy just seemed rushed I didn't even get his name to be honest but he was also serving the party of 12 he brought us our drinks and we looked at the menu. Well we didn't see him for 15min or so after that we ordered and I ordered a burger med. slowly it got packed for lunch now I saw a manager and 1 other server show up to serve some tables in the dinning room area so in total with the bartender 4 people in the whole packed restraunt. Now as we waited For our food we didn't see our waiter we sat there with empty glasses for 15min or so finally he showed up with refills. After that a female server brought our food out then left, I took a bite of my burger and it was way rare dripping blood. I sat there looking around fornny waiter for 10mins he was running food everywhere didn't even ask us how the meal was or even look in our direction. I finally had to tell at him when he was headed back to the kitchen. He came over and I told him the burger was way under cooked he didn't even apologize grabbed the burger and my fries and said I will get you another. So I sat there another 15min waiting and he came back with just my burger and no fries. He said I will get you some fries I ate my burger which was way over seasoned tasted like eating salt. I never got my fries never saw him again. We just paid on the kiosk and left. Once again a horrible time at this Chili's and we won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't believe I have had such a wonderful time at Chili's before as I did tonight for my husband's birthday!! The food was delightful and the atmosphere exciting, but the best part by far was the excellent service given to us by Kelly, our server. She was so intuitive that I don't think we even had a chance to have needs- she took care of them as they came up! I was very impressed and would come back if just to have the same experience!! Well done Chili's on the winning combo of such amazing food and staff!!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and the bartender Allyssa W did not even acknowledge us she had 4 quests at the bar already taken care of. We had to ask her 3 times for water and her response was I'm working on it. She is one of the worst Service people in the business she should work the back of the house where she doesn't have to deal with the public. We did stay for dinner and had Eric very professional glad to see some people who work there care about doing the right thing...One more thing she had NO drinks to make at service bar."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are amazing and are a must. Queso is delicious as well. The food is reasonably priced and the recent remodel did wonders for the restaurant. The people here are pretty friendly and accommodating. The hamburger here is usually a good choice."}
{"text":"Pleasantly content as we speak.   Visited this Chilis location between connecting flights for lunch and a bevy. The margarita was really good! Thick and frothy, just how I like it. I tried the bacon ranch quesadillas which were also satisfying. A lot of food, definitely a good bang for your buck. Lots of flavour. It can be a bit messy but good none the less!   The service was slow so make sure you leave enough time for yourself."}
{"text":"Not pleased with the service at this location. Sat in the bar area because you can seat yourself. I was with a party of 3, waitress asked the 2 others what they wanted to drink except for me.. Later on I ordered my food \" bacon and ranch quesadilla\" But with no meat ( chicken or beef ) added. The server then said \"so you just want a plain quesadilla then?\" And I said yeah  but with bacon. She then snapped back at me and said \"But you said no meat??\"  I didn't appreciate it and her tone was rude ..  I didn't feel like we received great customer service. I always have some kind of issue at this restaurant. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Honestly I needed a place to watch the playoff game, so I walked into the nearest place showing it. Luckily my girlfriend and I were seated with an outstanding waiter, Vinny. He really gave us the best service we've ever received from chili's. Food was great and hot, he frequently asked if everything was okay or if we needed anything. I can't lie, Chili's is Chili's, I really just wanted to give my man Vinny the recognition he deserves with a little appreciation due to the great service we received. We will definitely be coming back to this Chili's just for the great service Vinny provides."}
{"text":"I was going to write this awesome review about this place but I see that my gf beat me to the punch with her review just below mine.  Thanks Chili's! Always a good time with family and friends."}
{"text":"The only good thing was our waitress she was very attentive even though was obviously overwhelmed with customers. The food was mediocre it was a far cry from the pictures in their menu.  We ordered the half back ribs that was super dry and really small. Next was their house salad that look like it came from a plastic bag and they just served it with the sauce. Probably won't be ordering food next time only drinks."}
{"text":"I wonder where they get such low quality chicken breast...advised the server who said they just changed their supplier again!"}
{"text":"Umm this is chili's so I'm not sure that there's much to say that people woudn't already know. They are all the same, and the employee turnover is probably fast enough to make specific reviews meaningless.   However, I will say the reason that I'm giving this one bonus stars is cause they let my puppy in! It may have had something to do with it being an odd time of day, and pretty empty, but I asked the manager if they could accommodate a dog, and they said yes as long as we sat at a corner table.   Any place that lets my dog in is good in my book"}
{"text":"Awesome experience!! Had a very cool, respectful, server named Pablo who made sure me and my girlfriend were all set, great atmosphere! Everyone was so nice and happy and it just brightened my day alittle more highly recommended !"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last Monday evening.  One member of our party received her order incorrectly.  She wanted fish, but got chicken.  The server took the plate back to the kitchen, and the manager came over to apologize and advised that it would be 8 minutes to correct.  This member of our party was really hungry, and the rest of us had our meals, so she told them to just bring the chicken back, which they did.  The manager, B.J., apologized again and asked if we needed anything else.  About 10 minutes later, he came by our table, apologized again, told us he was going to comp her meal, AND gave her 10 bucks in Chili's gift certificates.  He really went above and beyond to make amends, and we were all very impressed by and appreciative of his professionalism.  Mistakes happen, but service like this is rare.  We will be back.  Thanks again B.J."}
{"text":"Came here this evening and came early at 5 pm so we could be seated right away to make a movie. It was half empty. Plenty of tables and the hostess not even a manager said it would be a 15-20 minute wait. I asked why since there tables open and he ignored the question. I then asked if there weren't enough servers and he said there was. We decided to go to the bar to eat. In addition he told us only the bar was open seating. Not the tables in the bar area. I have been coming a while and the bar seating has always been open. Thankful we had a great bartender named Carly, but this will be my last time here."}
{"text":"We came here last night for a quick bite to eat.  We sat in the bar area. It was during the NBA finals--the bar was understaffed. The menus were filthy.  The tables were not stocked -- no sugar carafe, no salt. My table seemed washed off however it was very sticky. Food was fair. Service was obviously slow/poor due to staffing. Someone in the kitchen area was cleaning a vent on the ceiling, not the appropriate time. So in my opinion, this place needs some management."}
{"text":"5 stars for the server Larisa!!! The two stars are for the two managers who couldn't agree on a Veterans discount.  Manager 1 yes Manager 2 no? Sorry my 100% service connected disability and service to our country isn't good enough for your 10% off!  I don't ever expect a discount, but I will always ask, being on a fixed income I want to be able to not just be able to dine out but also tip for good service and every little bit helps.  So just incase manager 2 is working I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Ordered a steak and mgr tried to convince me this was medium rare as if I needed to be convinced how a steak should be cooked. Won't be back to another Chilis."}
{"text":"I've been to this location only once but the food was great.   We were greeted by the hostess and she sort of seemed like she didn't want to be there though. However we got to choose which area to sit in which was nice (lounge is quieter vs the other area which was slightly noisier). Clean place.   My mum and I ordered the dinner for $22 (what I usually get with a friend or family of mine) and chose the half order texas cheese fries (let's ignore how unhealthy it is and talk about how yummy it is LOL)  and had the Cajun Chicken Grilled Pasta and the Bacon Cheese Ranch Quesadillas.   No ingredients were skimped out and it was delicious. Our server was friendly and sweet as well.   Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered basic Cheeseburger today and added a fried egg.  The sunny side up egg arrived on my burger still \"jiggly\" with translucent white areas.  It looked very unappetizing so I scrapped it off and ate the rest of the mediocre burger.  The fries were only mediocre as well.  Nothing spectacular at all about my lunch today with the exception of the waitress who was on point.  This place should be full at lunch...  I think the food is the reason why there's no wait  :-("}
{"text":"Kylie is so sweet! She is a superstar at customer service she got us everything We needed! As well as Sean who delivered the food! He was very nice and willing to get us anything to make our meal complete! Is was super good, everything was hot and they assisted us perfectly, and I was not disappointed  very good experience!"}
{"text":"It's Chili's I didn't go in with overwhelming expectations but we were hungry and wanted something quick.   Service was very slow, food came out a bit cold.  It felt like it was sitting on the warmer for a while because the food was cold in the middle but the plates where really warm.  This was especially surprising since there were 2 people working our area but only a few other tables had anyone sitting there.  Overall we won't be back, but in all honesty it's not a regular stop for us anyway."}
{"text":"Love their food. Everything comes out quick . Most employees are friendly. Food is fresh . It's a good place for lunch and they have lunch specials Monday through Friday from 11-4pm . From $6 includes entree and a starter! Can't beat it . Wish they had an option for a Caesar salad but they don't . I recommend the bacon avocado chicken sandwich . Only thing I found odd was serving salad on a warm plate? Lol"}
{"text":"Sat down, went 10 minutes without someone stopping by and left. Hostess gave us a half-hearted \"have a nice day\" as we left.   Now waiting at Cheesecake Factory for a table. Haven't been to Chilis in a few years, won't go ever again. Place is just poorly run."}
{"text":"Came here from out of town as we know Chili's and the menu. Our server Aaron was super nice. He knew we had just drove out so he made sure to send us back to our hotel with to go cups when he refilled our drinks. He packed our food to go that we didn't finish and even refilled our chips and salsa for the road. He was very attentive and the restaurant was clean and quiet. If we ever come back this way we'd visit again."}
{"text":"This place deserves 0 stars but I wasn't able to leave a review without giving it 1. DISGUSTING HAIR I bit right into while eating my quesadilla!! It's hard to see in this photo but it was very long and grey and about 4 inches long. I ordered lunch for my entire staff and nobody wanted to eat after they saw this. When our order was ready it took almost an hour for them to bring it out carside which was frustrating because I showed up at my schedule pickup time. Our food was cold when we got it and a couple of my staff got sick after eating theirs. Absolutely disgusting, I will never eat chili's again because of this terrible experience. Steer clear of this location!!!"}
{"text":"Most things about Chili's is meh...  Not bad but meh..  But it's a chain and there is not many ways to mix it up.  The food (fajitas) were good and the chips and salsa were also good.  Nothing bad but nothing stellar also.    Except our waitress!  We had a great experience with her.  Very fast, friendly, personable....  I don't think she will be there long.. She will be on to greater things :)"}
{"text":"Been coming for lava cake and we're lucky to get Rocky every time and he's the best! Great customer service friendly always checks on us really he just goes above and beyond to make sure we have a great experience every time. He is a 5 star employee himself and I think Chili's really lucked out to have him on the team!!"}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly good.  My ribs were tender. The service was good.  Only complaint was the hostess she was on her phone and made us wait before she asked how many.  She doesn't even matter this time, but she can actually set a tone for the way people perceive the restaurant to be that's why she is what we see first.  I wish I remembered her name."}
{"text":"Do better!! 87.5 sanitation inspection! Yuck!! Washing hands is a requirement everywhere"}
{"text":"This was a quick stop while waiting for our plane.  The airport was busy and so was this restaurant.  The staff was a bit overwhelmed and our waitress was not friendly.  Our food was a bit slow, but it tasted fine.  Not many options in the airport terminal, so this was fine."}
{"text":"This place is getting even better! I still wish there were more vegetarian options, especially vegetarian soup. Even though I don't eat meat the burgers looked so good! My friend had an avocado burger and my mouth watered looking at it. I did find a winner in the Margherita Flatbread Salad. Wow was that amazing. It was only 6.99 + 1.00 extra for quinoa. So many natural zesty flavors. Super filling. I was very surprised to find something so delicious and natural at Chilis!"}
{"text":"I don't get it, it's always only this location that I have a problem with: terrible to no service and waiting more than a half hour for our food!  I always try give this location the benefit of the doubt, but not anymore until today. Went in today, we were seated our waitress was fairly quick to get our orders in and after that, it went downhill. We never saw her after our order was taken, a half hour has passed and still nothing, no food and no waitress to at least tell us our food is almost ready. Another ten minutes still nothing and we were literally just about to walk out, and then our waiter finally came out with the food as we were getting up and she saw my face because I was angry and then she starts talking about how good the food was and blah blah. At this point, I did not care what she thought of the food because it was so fake the way she said it. After we got our food...she just disappeared again, this is ridiculous. Terrible and slow service as always at this location."}
{"text":"Okay, so, our family ordered dinner to go. Most of it was just as we'd ordered, but my shrimp quesadilla somehow turned into a broccoli quesadilla (probably my fault for trying to order something not on the menu). We live about 20 mins away and I didn't feel like loading 3 kids back into the car to fix the order, so I called in. The manager Vic was very friendly, very helpful, and genuinely did everything in his power to make things right. There's always a \"human element\" to things, especially food, and it doesn't always turn out exactly how you imagined it would. But, good customer service is always a definite plus when things go wrong! Thank you Vic!"}
{"text":"My flight isn't for another 3 hours so I needed to eat and charge my phone so I saw this chilis and it had a place to charge my phone next to a table   This place has the worst service that I'm writing this review as I'm still sitting in this place ! Their servers need to chose a different Job because they should not be allowed to work as servers ! It's like this place intended to hire the worst people   I was sat down by the hostess and I had to call someone over after being ignored for 15 minutes! The food takes too long and it's not even busy! The server has not come back to check on me   The food is just like any other typical chilis but honestly don't come here go buy yourself a burger or sit down somewhere else if it wasn't because I have so much time to kill I would of missed my flight because of how slow this restaurant operates"}
{"text":"Love Their salads and they have pretty good Mexican food.   I'm not a steak person so no comment on that. But they have good food. Service. Was good and prices are the same as most chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Moving in to the new age, chillis has pioneered a new way of dinning. Service was accommodating but 4 stars because the food could use some life, nothing super special but good enough that you finish your food."}
{"text":"The best part about Chili's is that you know you're gonna have a great experience even before you even enter the building. And once you do step inside, the atmosphere and the greeter will promptly welcome you, further solidifying the great experience you're going to have. The service at this Chili's is always phenomenal. The waiters never miss your table, they are quick to take your orders and any other requests you have, and that all do it with a smile on their face. They treat you like you are the best customer in the world.   Next the past you've all been waiting for. The food. All I have to say is this: you WILL NOT regret coming here. I have had almost every item on the menu and I can tell you that everything is always delicious. There is a lot of care that is put into their food, but their number one, and best, ingredient is love. Every bite you take you can tell that the chefs put their heart and soul into their work. Nothing is cooked half heartedly.  Overall, Chili's is one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had. From the building, to the food, to the servers, the experience is one that you will remember forever. Go to Chili's. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Is Chili's a five star restaurant, decorated with fine furniture, a warm atmosphere, and established as a reputable restaurant? Or is Chili's a local restaurant with charm, a bustling local scene, bursting with culture? Chili's is, in fact, both. Chili's is a blend of that hometown restaurant that only you know about as well as the great experience of a steakhouse. There's nothing better than walking into a Chili's. If you want to have a great time, you're in the right place.  First, restaurant was clean, smelled great, and has music at a reasonable volume. The greeter is always attentive to welcome you in. We were seated quickly, and our server was very friendly and attentive. He quickly took care of us and gave us water (we even had 7 people at our table and he still was on top of it all).  Even better, the food came out quickly, and it was hot off the grill. I personally got the Sunrise Burger, and I can tell you, it was AMAZING. It is by FAR one of the best burgers I've ever had.   Lastly, dessert. I got the molten lava cake. You've probably heard it before. It was DIVINE. Warm, delicious fudge inside a fluffy cake topped with a cool vanilla ice cream scoop. Nothing beats that!  Not to mention it was my 21st birthday. And I can say that it was one of the best birthdays I've had in a LONG time. I couldn't think of anywhere else to spend my birthday other than Chili's! If you're on the fence about trying out Chili's or haven't been in a long time, it is definitely worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Not once have I ever been disappointed by Chili's. Their food is excellent, the service is superb, and the atmosphere is way different than any other restaurant. Whenever you go to Chili's, you can expect to have the best food experience out there.  Now I've been to Chili's before, but this is the first time I've been to one since the big menu cut controversy. Everyone was worried that Chili's was cutting too much, or that they were getting rid of all their good menu options. However, I have to say that they have GREATLY improved what they've kept. Before the food was fantastic, now it is absolutely EXTRAVAGANT. They've decided to focus on what they do best, and they've definitely achieved their goal.   When I walked in, they hostess was quick yo welcome us with the famous, \"Hi! Welcome to Chili's!\" Immediately I was comforted by the warm colors, beautiful lighting, and exciting sports that were playing. We were seated promptly, and the servers were phenomenal! They were on top of everything! Anthony was our server, and he was the absolute best server that I've had. Chili's always has wonderful service, but Anthony went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. I would definitely want him as my server again.   Overall, you WON'T be disappointed when you go to this Chili's. Tip your severs because they put a lot of love into their service. This is a definitely a must go if your tummy needs some good food."}
{"text":"Chili's is an experience and the haters can walk away.   Here's the thing. Chili's is a restaurant where you craft your own experience, and the service is there to make sure it's a good one. Chili's makes sure that you're taken care of, and the way YOU treat your severs and the people around you affect your experience.  That being said, this Chili's restaurant is a little bit different than usual (at least it was for me). The hostess greeted us with the iconic \"Hi, welcome to Chili's!\" I knew that we were gonna have a wonderful experience here right when she said that. She actually said that the restaurant was open seating (this may have been due to the light traffic that night, so it may not be the same for you) and she gave us plenty of options to sit. We sat down and we're given just the right amount of time to figure out what we wanted to drink and eat.   And once our food came out. O.M.G. It was the best tasting food that I've had in a LONG time. Cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. The quality of food that is served at Chili's is always constituent. During that time, our server was always making sure we had everything we needed, and with a smile on her face! She was super nice and super attentive.   Overall, my experience was excellent. I will definitely be going back to this Chili's and all other Chili's."}
{"text":"Recently when I was in the vicinity of the 215 and N. Decatur in the Aliante and Centennial Hills part of the Valley, Chili's served us dinner on June 24 and lunch on September 11.       Chili's is a chillin casual dining chain that serves a variety of food and drinks ranging from steak to what else but chili. On June 24, I ordered the California Turkey Club with French Fries and bottomless Coke whereas on September 11, I ordered the Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger with French Fries and a bottomless Coke. Both meals after tax added up to approximately $20. I was satisfied with both sandwiches. The picture of the California turkey club shows an abundance of turkey meat topped with tomatoes and cheese between two slices of toasted bread next to a bowl of French Fries. This sandwich hit the spot after hiking up in Mount Charleston. As far as the Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger, there was nothing ultimate about it. There were no \"Wow!\" moments that I enjoyed in numerous Las Vegas restaurants that include Fire Rock and Bachi Burger. This is a good cheeseburger topped off with Applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, red onions, jalapeño, spicy buffalo sauce, pickles, lettuce, and honey chipotle sauce.     The first night we went to Chili's it was busy where on a Sunday during an NFL game it was relatively quiet. Both times, the hostess walked us to the same small booth overlooking the TV near the bar. Throughout both meals the service was good. The waitress would volunteer to bring new glasses of Coke to the table. Both times the waitress was polite and never rushed us. Chili's has merged real life service with the virtual world. Every table features a digital tablet where customers can order drinks plus pay the bill. When it turned into the time where what a few minutes ago were sandwiches and French Fries were now crumbs, the Waitress directed us to pay through the digital tablet. I am not a fan of a restaurant directing the customer to have to pay electronically. Credit cards and debit cards are convenient, however, so is paper money. What if the customer doesn't have a credit card? Both times, the waitress never elucidated if option B is paying by cash. Technology is nice as an option but not to be forced down the customers throat. The only thing I want forced down my throat on Chili's is either a California Turkey Club or Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger.      In conclusion I am of the opinion that Chili's is a chillin casual dining chain restaurant. Both times that I dined in this location during the summer I left satisfied and full."}
{"text":"I like Chili's pretty okay. When you give me a list of big-name chain restaurants for dinner it's usually my choice numero uno. This one in particular is hardly ever packed, even on game nights. The menu is as reliable as you come to expect from a chain restaurant. Staff is decent - bar staff is always most responsive. Perhaps because they get tipped heavier and know that communication will be a way to \"up the ante\".  I like the food especially because of the great variety here. You've got everything from sandwiches to large plate entrees and the like with Tex-Mex being the standard theme here. Excellent desserts - the skillet cookie with ice cream to be specific. I get a hankering for one of these from time to time and will literally go here just for a beer (usually a local grab from OMB) and the skillet cookie. I also love the mex-bowls because of the variety of ingredients all mixed up together. Ten-year-old me would've hated that stuff but even then I had their chicken crispers with corn on the cob and loaded mashed potatoes to chow down on. So again, huge variety, regularly changing/updated menu, good bar staff and a relaxing atmosphere. It's perhaps a once-a-month treat for myself when I'm just not feeling like trying something new."}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong with the boneless buffalo wings.  Am I right?"}
{"text":"It's been over 5 years since my last visit to a Chili's, so I honestly had no idea what to expect. My mom recommended we go here for lunch because she loves this place (bizarre to me, but mother knows best). The menu reminded me of what you'd find at a T.G.I. Friday's or Applebee's. Even though it was the day before Thanksgiving, the restaurant was really slow. We had three servers, including a trainee, waiting on us.   Food was average and decently priced. My family are experts on the menu and pick the same thing each time they come, so the ordering was paced to how fast I could make a decision. We weren't rushed by the servers and the timing of the food arriving was almost perfect. I did have to cram the last large bite of the loaded cheese fries appetizer into my mouth to clear enough room on the table though. But eating more cheese fries is something you will never hear me complain about.   If you're looking for a casual American or Tex-Mex restaurant, this might be your place.  The 2 for $20 deal allows two people to get select entrees and share an appetizer. It's in close proximity to the Century III mall and a shopping center, so you can come here for some reasonable priced food after a day of shopping."}
{"text":"Ugh, just like the flu, that fly, flying around and the 3 inches of foam on your beer, you are just glad when all is gone. All the \"F's\". Well, eff this place. We went after years of neglect to this establishment due to the darn chips and salsa that we were talking about and craving. Lesson learned: do not go for only one good reason, the rest were nothing short of bad. Seriously, bad. Like, boneless wings that were so hard, wing sauce that had a very manufactured, chemical like flavor, southwest eggrolls that need to roll over and fall off a cliff instead of enter your mouth (would have rather had a boneless wing in my mouth since it was at least hard, lol) and amazing chips and salsa. Tough call... bad food, and service, great chips and salsa and regular priced somewhat decent-ish drinks and prices (we did not attend during happy hour). I do not know, same famous last words as several years ago \"never again\" :("}
{"text":"I ordered the ribs with a special they had going on about a month ago. The ribs were great and everything that came with my order was good. I have no complaints and our server was excellent as well."}
{"text":"First time at this location and felt like something different tonight. Not really surprised by their average rating. The service we got was pretty poor. We ordered the two for 20 and got the Texas fries, chicken crispers, and Cajun pasta. Aside from the fries nothing was really that good the pasta was whatever and the crispers had too much sauce on them. We got prompt refills on all of our drinks but the problem was nothing got prebussed. We have a 9 month old baby so we need at least 20% of the table to be clear so she can't grab anything and it got to the point where there wasn't even enough room for that. She started out strong but then just kind of disappeared and didn't do anything. We got 2 refills but ended up with 3 big mugs each on the table by the end of the meal.  Overall we won't come back foods not worth the bad service."}
{"text":"We order a egg over easy and the waitlist was stuck and couldn't figure out how to cook the egg... we got up and left worst ever"}
{"text":"Last Saturday night around 7:30 we popped in at the bar thought we would get a few drinks and a bite to eat. With us, 7 people total sitting at the bar. We waited patiently to be greeted with dirty dishes in front of us, waiter was running food , made eye contact with us but continued what he was doing.  No bartender in sight. Then a tall guy in a football jersey comes behind the bar turns his back to us and watches the game. Waiter goes to the POS system and tells the tall guy to get him a bottle of vodka(instead of bussing the dishes in front of us, wipe down the bar tell us some will be with us in a minute), both made eye contact with us and still no acknowledgement. Football jersey guy returns behind bar again back to us watch ing football. After 20 minutes, we got up from the bar pushed our chairs in and then only then did the waiter acknowledged us and said \"So your not going to eat?\" My husband replied \"No were good.\" I get it, its Chilies, but wow cant even get good service at the bar."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and love it, not badly priced and food is always delicious!!! Will continue to make this our date night and family dinner spot."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location the service is terrible even though they assign two waiters per table.  The food is pretty good but I sure wish they would figure out how to train/hire good wait staff."}
{"text":"Arrived and waited for 10 minutes before I grabbed a menu and asked an employee if the guests were supposed to seat themselves.. He responded \"You can\" and walked by with out furthering assisting me."}
{"text":"If you don't want to grab yourself something from one of the fast food places in the food court, pull up a seat at Chili's Too instead, where you can be served by people who don't generally seem interested in working there, pay too much for whatever it is that you are ordering and have all sorts of people watch as you try and enjoy a leisurely meal.  You might be able to tell that this is probably not my favorite place to eat in the mall.  I'd actually rather grab a hot dog from Nathan's Famous.  It's only partially because I worked at Chili's a long time ago.  It's really because I don't like malls in general, and I don't go there to sit and try and enjoy a meal.  Most importantly, I don't want to wait in a line that is - amazingly - always longer than it should be to be treated poorly for overpriced food and leave much unhappier than when I arrived.  In other words, get fast food from elsewhere.  You have lots of choices."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a star just because it reminds me of the Chili's where I used to work many years ago.  The layout is exactly the same.  Lucky for them, because otherwise it would just be mediocre.  The staff is nice enough, but they don't really do much for me otherwise.  I guess that's actually a good thing, what with all the average service we've seen lately - what happened to people actually caring if you were getting good service?  As to the food?  There was a time that I didn't want to set foot in a Chili's, but it's been a long (long) time since I worked there, so I don't mind so much anymore, and the selection is really pretty decent.  We had a good variety.  I can never understand why people charge what they do for a plate of macaroni and cheese on the kid's menu (because they can), but apparently it's pretty decent.  I went for the buffalo chicken fajitas, and it was a solid choice, surprisingly.  Not healthy or anything, but not bad.  Service was speedy, but not overly friendly.  We may not be back anytime soon, but at least it wasn't a completely bad experience!"}
{"text":"First time to this location for early birthday drinks & food. It was mid afternoon so we sat in bar area where we had great service by bartender Jeremy.  Very friendly & checked on us frequently to ensure we had everything & refills as needed. Great job on the cosmos too!"}
{"text":"Service is friendly. Food is the regular Chilis warmed up fare. I'd prefer not to eat this style but was overruled by work friends."}
{"text":"It's just like every other Chili's. Nothing special but I have NOTHING to complain about. I wouldn't tell anyone they HAVE to go here because who seriously hasn't been to a Chili's before. We always get the 2 for $20."}
{"text":"Uhg. I have not gone to Chili's in a few years. The service is poor, food is so-so, and priced a bit high for what you're getting. And recently I tried them again.. they are consistently disappointing. Waited 15 minutes after sitting for drinks. Waited 40 minutes to order. Received food 1hr 15min after sitting. My burger was good but the onion rings were cold and mushy. Will not be back. For the record, I like Fridays, Red Robin, and Applebees."}
{"text":"I ordered a platter of sliders, southwest eggrolls and wings. Everything was pretty acidic. The service was fast, the beer was cold, and it was your Basic Chili's food, so not that great.   One thing I didn't like was how they had just one girl busting her but on seemingly everything, while others were apparently busy with something else. Looked like she needed more help. No one was happy to be working there at all."}
{"text":"Ordered a Caesar Salad, there was BARELY any dressing... (I've made better salads at home then that)  Ordered Strawberry Lemonade, had to ask for more sweetener  Ordered Honey Chipotle Crispers, had to ask for extra sauce. It looked like they just half a**ed tossing it. Some places on the chicken wasn't even covered , it was just dry.  Corn was hard, like it had been sitting and just warmed it up. The ONLY reason they got 2 stars is because of the waitress. She was nice."}
{"text":"This is one of my personal favorites....super-busy on friday nights....but they have  a very lively atmosphere. It always perks me up if I am feeling low. You can never walk out without getting the following 2 things: 1) Shanghai wings...yummmmm 2) Molten Chocolate cake....yummmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Lunch with 2 salads took a total of 30 minutes to be served.  They weren't even busy!  Wait staff wasn't great either."}
{"text":"Had there lunch special yesterday and the potato soup was so good, then came the sandwich and the size was perfect and it was so good. I never had a sandwich like that before; it was more like an individual pizza but no tomato type sauce, it was made with spinach, chicken, cheese, and  other sliced vegetables; it was so! I will definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"Good bar specials. Chicken egg rolls are good with the avocado sauce. Buffalo wings are ok but on the smaller side. Sauce is a little too buttery for me. Chips and salsa are always good to share!"}
{"text":"Well, it started out good but ended bad. We sat at a booth at the bar and the server was very nice. He was very attentive too. But at soon as we placed our order, he disappeared. I don't think it was necessary his fault because I noticed he had a good 7-8 tables. Not fair to him or anyone else.   We needed refills on drinks and never got it. My husband got the soup and salad combo and had to flag him down for more soup. I got the egg rolls and they were good. We also got the white queso and it was not good at all. The guacamole on it was brown so it wasn't fresh. Plus the queso wasn't fully heated so it was super thick and lukewarm. We were still waiting on him because we needed boxes. After waiting over 10 mins I just went to their station and got the boxes myself. Two girls sat behind us and waited a good 15 mins before they were greeted and they finally stopped someone. That server gave them drinks but their original server which was ours never came to them. They finally stopped him and told them how disappointed they were in waiting for so long.   I won't be back. Not worth the hassle. We were there for almost 2 hours!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I eat out about 5 times a week, and we thought this was the loudest restaurant we have ever been in.  One TV in the bar had the bass turned up really loud so that it's thunder drove into the far booths where we sat, and with another TV's sound on, plus the Tears For Fears on the speakers, it was an amazing bombasticity----how do you even decide to have three audio sources going on at the same time and one of them with a subwoofer that plays TV ads along with the programming?!  So....our server asked us three times about desert while we were still eating our main plates-----who on earth is trained to rush your guests like this?!  The food?  One item was quite good we thought, and another was mediocre at best.  There is no reason to return here with all of the other options available...."}
{"text":"It's the typical chain of Chili's however they have a server at lunch named Paige. If you go ask for her and tell her I sent you. She is be far the best server I have ever had and does such a great job! My co-worker and I go here just because of her, the food isn't anything out of the world it is good, but the service ranks this place above many others.  The lunch specials will fill you up as well! The soups are completely awesome!"}
{"text":"The food was good, as you would expect from a Chili's. The biggest reason for the five stars is Christopher and his excellent customer service. Our flight to Austin was delayed by four hours. We ended up with vouchers. It was a bit of a madhouse in Chili's. Christopher managed to get it all done properly.   Unfortunately, it seems to be a rare occasion these days to find someone who is interested in customer service. Christopher covered every base I can possibly think of. It was the outstanding service that earned the five stars. The food, three, maybe four at the max. Customer service itself is worth 1 star at least."}
{"text":"I always get to go food from this location for the family. The to go staff is very helpful and always check your order to make sure it's right.  The down side is the bartender. I sat there for over 15 min waiting on my to go order and was going to order a beer while waiting and the guy never paid any attention. This experience is consistent each time I've been to this location. Your job as a bartender is to sell as much volume as efficiently as possible. Chilis is losing money."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday to have a late lunch. Ordered the steak fajitas and they were....okay. Steak was tad overcooked and along with onions and peppers had an off taste which I assume came from the cast iron serving skillet which probably hadn't been properly seasoned before use. Rice was bland, beans were cooler than everything else, but tasted okay. Only thing that truly saved the experience was the friendly server who made sure I had/got everything I ordered and needed. Otherwise, just another average Chili's in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great food... Good service...  The chicken tortilla soup is amazing, but just about everything on the menu is good."}
{"text":"Food was good service was not great.  Not there when you need them.  Had to get up for silverware and napkins and for more water."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of the Fajitas. Very yummy, beers are always cold and on point. Your typical corporate restraunt chain. Get the same no matter where you go. I always stop in when I'm indecisive on what I want to eat, so my fall back is Chili's.  Yum."}
{"text":"I always forget why I don't come here and then I remember. It's mediocre at best."}
{"text":"This review is for your kitchen staff. Though I can't call them out by name,  i want to recognize them.  I have food allergies and this is so far the only restaurant that I can eat at without getting sick or getting cross-contaminated.  Thank you!  I know very well what steps have to be taken to ensure my food's safety and I want to express my appreciation.  You all have made my life easier and I am in your debt."}
{"text":"Used to love going to Chili's in the past.  And when I was low on cash, I worked part time at this one.  Slang plates and collected some dough.  Thanks for the tips everyone (10 years ago)."}
{"text":"Arrived to sit at the bar.  There were several personnel sitting and standing, talking to each other while the bar was filthy.  I sat down  and someone asked something to the effect of what I would like, to which I replied a clean area.  She took my order and the bean burger arrived about 15 Minutes later with minimal fries.  She dropped it off without asking if I'd like anything else.  I told her a few minutes later I'd like some mustard.  She came back about five minutes later with it.  The burger completely fell apart, but that's the least of my issues.  She not once came by to ask how things were.  I'm still at the bar, she's seen my empty tray and still didn't ask how things were.  Worst experience at a Chili's."}
{"text":"The grass fed burger patty was a good choice, but the toppings are a joke of a portion. It's called the guacamole jalapeño burger, but you'll get maybe 1 tablespoon of guacamole for a full sized burger that can only be smashed as far as to cover 1/4 of the burger as a thin layer with maybe 2 slices of chopped jalapeño. The black bean burger patty was scorched, crispy, and borderline inedible. Not sure why chilis togo does such a poor job, but I know it would be much better if we ate on location, at least I would hope. Regretted this choice for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"This is a nice location. It is very kid friendly and the food is good. Our waitress was so nice and so sweet with the kids. We ordered the ribs and the chicken and waffles and everything tasted yummy. Their molten cake is delicious and one thing I really liked is their kids menu had many options including grilled chicken, fruit, broccoli , corn as opposed to only chicken tenders and fries!"}
{"text":"We sat in the bar, the waitress saw us sit down, never came to the table, finally we went to the bar to see if someone was working that area. The bartender finally sent her over. Crappy service, very slow with drinks and food. Waitress gave no help with ziosk, we WON'T be back! I only gave a star because it made me to leave a post."}
{"text":"We come every Thursday for the best Presidente Margaritas made by Erin. Love the atmosphere and the great food options."}
{"text":"Listen, my husband and I love eating at local, non-chain places, but Chili's is our go to restaurant.  I almost feel guilty about it, but they are consistent. The food is good, the service is almost always fast and friendly,  and it's easy when we want to go out, have an easy meal, and not have any hastle."}
{"text":"I had been to this Chili's with my son and had great food. I came back for the Quesadilla salad. I was with my hubby and he ordered a prime rib bowl. His bowl was very good. He really liked it. My salad was ok but nothing like the one I had on my visit with my son. Half of the salad was overdressed. You could wrong out the lettuce. The other half had not one drop of salad dressing. The chicken also seemed rubbery. I also think the dressing was different than the one I had on my previous visit. The service was good. I just wish my food had been better."}
{"text":"I made an error in one of the names. Her name is Melissa and she is one of the 3 that we so love! We stop in when ever we're passing to our home up in Black Canyon City or if we're coming from a store nearby. The folks I mentioned before are just soooo Great! We even get our usual parking place :) They always treat us well and with total respect. They know what we order and they know what we drink. We love them! We don't go anywhere else in the area. I can't say enough about this Chili's. Even the folks that aren't our server/bartender say HI always. My husband is a Cancer patient. When I get your emails for a free dessert- I make sure he gets it. Thank you all. (SF)"}
{"text":"Sat in the bar  had a sugar free margarita cameo the server was nothing short of amazing. Funny knowledgable and spot on. The food was great have not been in a long time we will come back soon"}
{"text":"I don't eat at chili's too often, but i should because i have never had a bad experience there, but i don't like chains and franchises.  any way stopped there for lunch and had their pick 3 dinner dipper thing and it was great and not too much food, 2 mini burgers (excellent) chicken wings (excellent) and artichoke egg roll thingies (great too).  almost finished it all and very good, great service and pleasant.  anything i can do to stimulate the economy."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to brave the crazy crowds by the outlets on Christmas Eve and went to the nearby Chili's for dinner. Surprisingly, the restaurant was not very busy and we got a great booth in the bar area where we could view the two football games on TV.   Our server, Lee, was amazing! He cheerfully took our order and checked in on us frequently throughout our meal. My husband ordered a burger without cheese and when another server brought it out with cheese, Lee was very apologetic and immediately offered to replace it.  I 100% recommend the spinach queso dip. It comes with a little bit of guac and salsa on the side. The chips are TO DIE FOR (warm, crispy, and just perfectly salty) and Lee surprised us with another bag to take home.   I will definitely be dining here again and asking for Lee as my server."}
{"text":"Maybe this isn't my week because this is the 2nd time in as many days that I've eaten out and encountered substandard help from the staff but this time the customer to staff ratio really made it ludicrous that I'm having to point this out.  I walked into this location around 3pm, aside from me there was 1 customer at the bar and 1 table I was customer # 3. Right when I walked in I went to the restroom to wash up and when I came back I found the hostess stand empty.   As I had walked back to the bathroom there was a pair of the wait staff eating in the back customer table by the bathrooms and exit, don't bother to look up and say hi or anything they just kept on doing their thing.   After leaving the restroom I passed 1 table occupied by a female manager that faced the front door, she was busy in paperwork but also oblivious to the fact that someone was standing there, waiting to be seated only 15 feet directly in front of her, not once did she look up or she would have called someone or taken care of it herself.   From the hostess stand you see directly into the bar area, 1 customer was seated at the bar, 2 employee's were sitting at the booth directly line of sight from the hostess station, they glanced over several times and made no attempt to ask if I needed something.   After 3 minutes (I know this because I was counting 30 second commercials on ESPN) the bartender finally poked her head up and asked me if I needed anything, yes I'd like to be seated and have lunch.   I won't rip her too badly because I sat in her section and she did take care of me well, to the point where I left her a 5 dollar tip, however the fact that 5 front room staff who were only taking care of 4 customers couldn't see it fit to take 10 seconds and do what they are supposed to do almost had me walking out.   The food is basic Chili's, honestly never really had a bad meal there but it's important to point out that even with a manager a few feet away and an empty restaurant, I was left hanging, almost walked out and once that happens, it will be a long time before I come back... there are too many choices in a small area and Chili's is not exactly the best of the best of them."}
{"text":"Super fast service and clean facilities! Located at the heart of The Strip! The prices seem to be a little bit higher than your average Chili's, but nothing too crazy. They provide the same food and drink services that you would expect at a regular Chili's."}
{"text":"Amazing....they don't serve chili!!! Overall the food was okay. I ordered the chicken Tacos. They were so so, wouldn't order them again though."}
{"text":"Don't even consider the skillet queso! I guess my Spanish is rusty,  but i thought queso is cheese.  I am pretty sure there is no cheese in this dish.  It tastes like watered down chili."}
{"text":"This Chili's is always fun ! Great place to watch the game and even though it was packed the service was quick ! I always get the triple dipper but i doubt you can find something you don't like on the menu ! Simple but good ! Southwestern egg rolls are the best !!"}
{"text":"Avoid this location at all costs, disorganized, food takes forever, food comes out disgusting sitting under the heat lamp at best if not cold. Never again!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. They don't even wash off their tables. In less than ten minutes of walking into the restaurant and being seated, we noticed how sticky the table was. My partner rubbed the table down with a napkin and sanitizer, and lord Behold dirt and glitter on the napkin. The table was so dirty that the dirt appeared black on the napkin. If they can't even clean/sanitize the table then what makes you think that they can clean their plates, forks, glasses or anything else at the establishment. We were so disgusted that we walked out. Never will come back to this place. NEVER! I wish I could give it 0 starts because they don't even deserve 1."}
{"text":"Now, I'm all for the second amendment,but at this moment there is a guy throwing back the beer while open carrying a firearm.im glad chilis supports the second amendment,but serving booze to someone open carrying a firearm is stupid on both parties sides."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time ordering the Ancho-Salmon. It was surely delicious for a salmon. Highly recommend the Texas cheese fries for an appetizer. It is our favorite and we always order two! The strawberry lemonade is my favorite drink there, even during the winter when it's cold out.  Our server was super helpful with the ordering because the ribs combo was a little confusing, but it's all good in the end.  Food was delicious and the service was amazing tonight!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to come to for a drink after work or dinner with the  family.  Just across the parking lot from the AMC 30 so it the perfect place to come for dinner and a movie.  The staff is always friendly and just about everything on the menu is good."}
{"text":"It's with disappointment they are lucky I have to give 1 star just to leave a review. We rarely eat here but after leaving Buffalo Wild Wings which is in the same area due to lack of serve and both their restroom and bar tops were a mess. We decide on Chili's. We were seated promptly and they had this kiosk on the table with games and to order drinks, appetizers, and to pay your bill. We ordered a cocktail my husband the famous Presidente Drink myself a beer. His drink salty. We ordered an appetizer guacamole and salsa with chips. Did not look as appealing as the picture and salsa salty. We then ordered a plate of Texas Dry Rub Ribs and Original BBQ Rib with Mash Potatoes broccoli myself Chicken, Steak, and Shrimp Fajitas. Food arrives the dry rub ribs were extremely salty and mash potatoes tasted like from a box my fajitas came out cold and not sizzling as another customers came out steaming and sizzling. The steak was rubbery, chicken not fresh but the shrimp was good. It came with a splash of sour cream, a spoonful of guac little bit of shredded cheese and a spoonful of pico de gallo not enough to eat this plate. Unfortunately the food was just like eating spoon full of salt. And for what we ordered having to pay $62 was not worth the price. When it came time to pay we were charge $1.99 free for using kiosk which no where did it say we had to pay to use. Truly disappointed in our visit and will never go back again!"}
{"text":"SLOW SERVICE!! Since my last review Chili's has gone backwards. We were seated and then it took more than 10minutes before anyone even spoke with us, so we placed both the drink and food order to speeds things up. With hardly anyone in the restaurant it then took over 40 minutes for our food to arrive after we ordered it. At least the food tasted decent."}
{"text":"food was ok, the service good, went for birthday party, ok?"}
{"text":"If you want food poison this is  your place. Dirty place food was poor quality. Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"Went in for an early dinner, sat in the bar area at a table. My server was good but the one sitting at a nearby table in uniform drinking a beer was extremely loud and disrespectful to the guests around her. I can tell you she is having some friends over with a baby this week if anyone wants to go.. The food came out in a timely manner and was fair to good. My NY Strip looked more like a flat steak but was seasoned well. The timing between the pre dinner salad and dinner was a lil short so in order to eat my meat while hot I had to cut my salad short. I have decided not to return for a while and see if they can get some better management. Seeing a staff member in uniform consuming alcohol is not indicative of a family environment nor is it something I wish to have my kids see and think it's ok while grooming their social and personal skills."}
{"text":"WTF happened to Chili's? I used to frequent the one on Mill Ave for lunch because they were fast and the food was usually pretty decent. Don't get me wrong, I'm not talking gourmet or healthy, but it at least tasted decent.   We went to this location for dinner the other night and it was absolutely horrible. The service was incredibly slow, we ordered and it took over an hour  and a game of chase with our waitress to finally get our food. We complained to her about the wait and she offered no apology. When we finally did get our food it was cold.. Not luke warm, but cold. In addition to that, the famous Southwestern Eggrolls were a soggy mess. I rarely complain to a manager but this situation warranted a big complaint.   The manager was nice and gave us 20% off the bill and a free gross dessert to go. We ended up pitching it in the trash, it was completely inedible. Chili's you have officially made the Blacklist."}
{"text":"Didn't like the food at this chilies the portions where way smaller when I ordered the chicken strips looked as if they were half the size and I always order the same thing at chilies. I never had it look the way it did the time I went to this location. when I spoke to the waitress she said that it was fine but I was not happy at All."}
{"text":"Chilis has always been my favorite place to go to but this location is always just subpar compared to the other locations .. we waited at the front for at least 5 minutes while the other server was just staring at us and not saying anything until we got to the bar . Also we ordered the margaritas and they weren't how the margaritas normally are in a margarita glass and they tasted like straight lemonade .. also we asked the manager guy if we could get new chips because the ones that came out were stale and cold and he just said they are all like this .. the actual manager man (Caucasian male heavy thick build) said that to us .. so we proceeded to leave and told him and he said well we can't do anything and antagonized us on the way out .. I just appreciate that if I am paying my money to come and eat and even with all the extras from the other employees including the bartender and we both did nothing but be patient and kind and then still get the treatment we received is ridiculous. The manager was completely out of pocket and rude for how he was talking to women let alone customers too. The service should be all the way through until the doors close and that defines the difference between a thriving restaurant and a soso one ! I hope to anyone who reads this ; just don't go at night time and you will probably not get the same horrible service !"}
{"text":"I used to really love going to this Chili's, we have been coming to this location for about 10+ years, but tonight was probably one of the worst service we have had. Server forgot everything we requested and never checked on us once to the point I had to get up from the table and track him down to ask for refills and extra ranch again. Food was ok, but the service was horrible and manager was no better either. Sad part is they weren't even busy. So disappointed  guess I have to find a new Chili's to go to."}
{"text":"Seemed like this location was under staffed poor waiter was working to many tables by himself. The food was not good only ended up eating just a little bit. Some grouchy waitress you could hear her complaining and yelling in the back and see her attitude when she came out."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Been there twice. Thought maybe the first time was just a bad day. Took two hours to eat lunch. And the place was half empty. I will not go back again"}
{"text":"This is one of my husband and I favorite restaurants. Always good service and good food! We love the boneless buffalo wings"}
{"text":"I had called in an order for pick up food was done very quickly which was nice on my lunch break but when I went to eat my food it all looked old and dry I got the Texas fries and the cheese was burned. I was very upset I was really looking forward to eating this but was very bad. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is the only bar in sight of the gate I always end up at in terminal D.. I've never not been able to get a table, but good luck getting a seat at the bar. Service is horrible here. I've always had to wait at least 10-15 minutes to even be acknowledged by the server. The most recent visit, I was waited on by an older gentleman...he was the worst server I've ever had! He could barely handle the few customers he had. Oh!! Did I mention the prices? I understand it's the airport and prices are at a premium..but I can't get a standard margarita for under $18!! And that doesn't include the tip for the crappy service! I'll be back for my fix to calm down before my flight, but I won't enjoy it.."}
{"text":"We went to this Chili's on Gilbert and crossroads and the service was horrible. No one greeted us at the door. They just said it's a 45 minute wait. There were at least 6 dirty empty tables available in the restaraunt. I asked if my family could sit in the bar, she said yes just stands by a table and someone will come clean it. We stood there for 13 minutes and other people started coming in and there tables got cleaned 1st and there drink orders were taken. So my niece pulled out her sanitizer wipes and cleaned our table. Bonnie the server finally came over, no greeting or thanks for the wait and said \" I'm Bonnie but another server will come take your orders\" WT! So we waited and I believe a new worker came over, she was sort of sweet. She took our food order and after 30 min of waiting, the honey Chipotle chicken strips were under cooked. We sent them back. 15 minutes later they bought a new order over, still under cooked. The Mgr came over, no apology and said \"we checked the temperature and it was fully cooked\" uhmm NO! fried chicken should not be wet and pinkish in color when you bite into it. The batter was wet and it was just gross. They took it off the bill. I left hungry. I would never go back"}
{"text":"Wow! No words. We came in around 830 on a Friday and asked to sit in the bar. After watching 3 staff members try to figure out how to bus a table for 5+ mins another couple(already sitting in the bar) walked over and sat down. Hostess/server said nothing and then to proceed to bus a 2nd table for our party..... Lol yeah right. We walked out and went elsewhere. Amazing! Why is the hostess bussing tables? Serious question."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has any bad reviews, but all I can guess is that they are old and out-dated. I've been to Chili's quite a lot. It isn't my favorite restaurant, but it's usually ok. This place is the exception. First, you're greeted at the door by Vickie. This in itself is reason enough to come here... frequently! Vickie is delightful! I don't care how your day is going, after you interact with this angel, you're going away smiling. Our food came out fast and smoking hot! Every bite, to the very end was hot and the flavor wasn't just dusted on one side, but was carefully and painstaking crafted as though the kitchen staff was working toward their James Beard or Michelin Star! Our server was great too. Never let our drinks get close to the bottom. Even the manager met every table to make sure that everything was perfect. It was. Perfect. If I lived any closer, I'd be a regular here. Actually, maybe I'll move for just that reason!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm about to do this, changed my rating to 4 stars, heck I could even go 4 and 1/2. But the meal I had at this location recently really deserves the upped score.   We met a relative here for dinner and I was so hesitant to even come back because of my last experience, and with Chili's, Applebee's, Friday's in general I would pick any other place to eat if given the choice. But here we were. I was thinking of just getting an appetizer to pick at and then have a late dinner at home, but when I saw the special new steak menu I was intrigued, and there are probably two or three times a year I get a steak craving and it's nice to indulge it.  So, I ordered the parmesan crusted steak with steamed broccoli and the pepper gravy mashed potatoes. Our waitress asked if I wanted mushrooms on the steak and of course I did. I wasn't expecting much, but our food came out and I was blown away. The steak was delicious and the parmesan and mushrooms really gave it so much extra. My mashed potatoes were amazing with that pepper gravy I could have ordered a second helping. Surprisingly they even did the steamed broccoli justice and it was cooked right and seasoned just enough. I think I ate almost every bite on my plate in amazement.   I don't know what they did, new cook, new menu, new attitude, but whatever it is keep it up because I am impressed."}
{"text":"Ate here while waiting for my plane. Server was attentive. Hubby and I split the appetizer sampler and the chips with guacamole and salsa. Guac does not have much flavor. Sliders on the sampler were yummy. Boneless wings were a bit over done. Wasn't a bad place to hang out while waiting for the plane. Outlets are located around the booth seating. Beware of the attack of the fruit flies. Must have killed at least a dozen while sitting there."}
{"text":"Just went here yesterday with my girlfriend.  Took no less than 5 minutes to get a seat on a Tuesday afternoon.  Our server was very attentive from the start.  We received our appetizer really quick,  got our usual chips and salsa which is delicious,  their guacamole is super fresh and tasty.  We also order two Margaritas and goodness these things were super strong,  but good.  I like getting a drink with some kick to it other than feeling like I am not getting my monies worth.   We ordered the bacon and ranch quesadilas and man,  the sauce that came with was phenomenal.  Overall a great experience.  Be sure to get their 35 dollar deal,  appetizer,  2 meals, 2 margs all for 35 dollars.  Worth it just due to the service being great.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Be warned! As soon as you tap on a \"premium app game\" on the tablets provided on the tables, .99 cents will automatically be added to your bill."}
{"text":"We are regulars at Chilis, especially this location. It's pretty much hit or miss with service. Tonight was a miss. It didn't seem too busy, we came in at 8:45pm on a Saturday night. We sat for a while before being approached. A server came by just to tell us that someone would be with us shortly, ok at least done acknowledgement. A few minutes later the same server came by to tell us the exact same thing. Ok....finally our server came, she was pleasant but we didn't see her pretty much the rest of the time. No refills, no check up no check! Luckily Chilis has that automated check out system on the table. We always love the food and especially the Platinum Presidente Margarita, delish! Just wish the service was as consistent as the food.  Can't go without the Queso dip either, I swear I crave that stuff on the daily!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food and drinks:) the chicken crispers were a little chewy but I still enjoyed everything:) I went during lunchtime and happy hour :) (around 3) :)"}
{"text":"Still my favorite place for happy hour specials. Beer starting from $4, and appetizers from $2.99  or $4.99. Its honestly pretty inviting to where if you come in alone and sit at the bar, you won't feel awkward being there by yourself, which I've done a few times. There is a divider over by the bar and lounge area which u must be 21 to sit in, but you can sit right on the opposite side of that divider if you have any kids and still want their happy hour.   I've never personally spoken to a manager but I've noticed how they handle some really annoying customers, and they are able to keep their cool and stay professional, so kudos to them. But all the servers, bartenders, and bus people seem very friendly."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in awhile but man I'm impressed. Their menu has done a full 360. They have a lot more healthy options, seems like the baby back ribs flavors are always changing, I love the idea of table side guacamole."}
{"text":"I prefer Chili's any day than a TGIF or Applebee's. The variety is huge and everyone will win, whether if your a hardcore meat eater, vegetarian, or even if you are on a diet. The flavors for their ribs are always changing, currently they have a beer flavor and a Dr. Pepper flavor. I love their happy hour, which is from 3pm-7pm Mon- Thurs, and Sunday all day, not sure if i'm missing another time slot in between there. For Happy hour they will have appetizers at 4.99 or 2.99, and drinks such as beer starting at $3 and Margaritas starting at $4.50.  Some of my favorite items are their Spinach and Artichoke dip, chips and salsa , chicken crispers, ribs, cinnamon apples, burgers, fries, ranchsauce, chili soup, steak and shrimp fajitas, and molten chocolate cake.   This time i ate the Grilled Sirloin with Grilled Avocado, it is one of the  items from the Healthy choices. Its a 6 oz sirloin or u can upgrade it to 9 oz, it is drizzled with a cilantro sauce, served with cooked cherry tomatoes and garlic and with a salad all on one plate. I always order mines medium rare.   I also got the Skillet queso, which is a mix of ground beef with beans and nacho style cheese. Comes served with chips and salsa. Great chips, they are warm and thin.   And we also got the Molten Chocolate cake. Its chocolate cake with warm chocolate in the middle, ice cream on top with hard shell chocolate."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service! I would love to see them allow more substitutions on the menu."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years. Itused to be a place to meet for lunch on Saturday because there weren't many choices and you could get a margarita. My friend said it had an updated menu with new items and wanted to try it again  We went mid afternoon and it wasn't busy. We sat in a booth and ordered our drinks  We didn't have to wait long and they arrived. Pretty standard but tasted good.  We ordered fresh guacamole withe the chips and salsa. That came quickly,too. It was clearly fresh and good. I was pleasantly surprised  We also got the chicken nachos. That's been on the menu forever. Served warm with fresh lettuce,pico, and sour cream. Old favorite and still good White queso dip was also good There are new items too.  My friend got the chicken margarita bowl. That looked really good. I wish I had gotten that. All fresh. Fresh avocado and fresh looking beans and corn  Again a pleasant surprise  I got the trio fajitas. Shrimp,chicken,and steak. Lots of food. I had to ask for lime but server then brought several pieces. Nothing was over cooked  Nice We had a very nice lunch. Other things on the menu I want to try I will put this chain back on my restaurant go to list"}
{"text":"My experience here was great! The guacamole was amazing. It tasted really fresh. The skillet cookie (dessert) was great. The service was very fast."}
{"text":"We have not been to Chili's in a long time. The Hubs and I have been there twice in the last two weeks. The food was great both times. This is a very, very busy location.  The honey chipolte boneless wings, prime rib tacos, and the queso dip are our new raves.   My husband had his birthday dessert the Salted Caramel Molten and loved it!   We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This Chili's has the best service I have encountered out of all the Chili's restaurants I've been to. The staff are friendly, fast, and efficient. The food is excellent.  Be sure to try the original Baby Back Ribs that made them famous, or the new Southern Smokehouse Bacon Cheeseburger (The bacon is almost as thick as a McDonalds hamburger patty). They also do an all you can eat soup and salad at lunch. Regular size portions of soup & salad, not the mini servings that you'd get at Applebees, and much faster service, well worth the $6.99.  I'm addicted to the blackberry iced tea, so I have to keep going back ;)"}
{"text":"The bomb dot com...   Whenever I feel like having a meal that is above par with fast food yet below a super expensive restaurant I think of chilies :)   The employees are usually always friendly here and pretty quick with taking care of me and my gf.   Love the location cuz it's close to home and I also love their food   Come here with family and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"We had a good time. Friendly service-***** Food- **** Value-***** Over all good experience. Server take care us very good."}
{"text":"We've been going to Chili's for as long as I can remember-  probably a good 15 years or so.  Never again!  They changed (downgraded) their once decent menu, and the service was lackadaisical.  It took forever to get my child a glass of water.  And they brought my rice, and fajita trimmings out way before I actually got my chicken and shrimp.  And the shrimp was undercooked (raw in spots)!  I had to wait about 10 minutes after they brought out my wife's and child's meals to get mine.  And they forgot my shredded cheese, which I had to ask for.  The toffee ice cream dessert was terrible as well, with the toffee tasting anything like good toffee should taste.  The bottom line is that we felt like we were not too welcome there, and much of the staff seemed like they were just 'going through the motions'.  And our bill was close to fifty dollars for a party of 3!  Our recent visit to Chili's totally reminded me of why we've been going to family restaurants and diners more and more lately, and to national chains less and less!  We get much better value, portions, and service at locally owned diners, at less than half the price one would pay at a national chain!  And now they have these stupid, electronic things on the tables which just take up precious space, and makes a smaller table top (as in the ones by the bar) feel much too crowded!"}
{"text":"Called in a quick order to-go and came in for a drink to wait. My receipt says my bartender was \"brown brown\" so I will go with that. She was really sweet, made me a great Deep Eddy lemonade and made sure my to-go order was correct-- even opened it to show me. I appreciate the little things... I appreciated her and her sweet disposition."}
{"text":"Long time customer BUT, Not Now!  The lady at the front Argued with me because I wanted a Booth by myself instead of sitting at the bar!?!   There were booths available, I know! I can see them!  I told her several times I wanted a booth.  She continued to argue with me..   I said Forget it!  I'm going to another restaurant!   I WILL NEVER BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever experienced by a waiter. Cameron, the bartender, saw what was going on and came and took care of us. He saw it took 18 minutes to get our  initial drinks. (only got them because Cameron brought them to us) Ordered appetizer and it was never rang in. Cameron finally rang it in for us. Ordered a second round of drinks and they were never rang in, 30 minutes later Cameron came over. A table of 4, sat at the same time, had boxes with left-overs before we even had our appetizer. So disappointed in the inconsistency.  If it wasn't for Cameron, I would have walked out. this was not a good experience.."}
{"text":"Vegas Football Happy Hour for Sunday Football!!!  We ordered our own personal buffet of appetizers and all were awesome! Our Apps were the Cheese Fries, Spinach Dip, Buffalo Wings and Onion Straws. We also had two double margaritas and four Baily's with coffee. Our total was $68.00.   The service at the bar was great. Our bartender was very nice.  My only complaint?? Their televisions are placed along the walls rather than above the bar. It makes it hard to sit at the bar and enjoy a game since their TVs are only about 32\".  Great Specials for Sunday Football."}
{"text":"Worst service I've had. I usually enjoy chili's but this visit was so poor I probably won't be returning to this location. Timing was also an issue, it took 35 mins for our appetizer alone to get to our table, imagine how long it took for them to place the actual order. Poor experience over all"}
{"text":"This is the worst dining experience I have had in at least a dozen years. The service was so completely inept that it might as well have been absent.  We ordered the all-you-can-eat salad and soup for a quick lunch. We also ordered a chips and salsa. Our \"server\"informed us later that the chips and salsa were out of stock. How is that possible! Worse yet he left that charge on the bill. This is just the beginning.  Not once did the server come back to see if we wanted to have a drink refill or additional soup. It took us almost two hours to have this \"quick\" lunch and get our check, after having the out of stock chips and salsa removed from the bill, for us to leave. This used to be one of out favorite places.   We will not be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I go here quite often and try to get in early, like between 5-6 because it is always super busy later on in the evening. Thats a good sign in my book! They have made a mistake once or twice, but are always willing to fix the problem cheerfully. Will continue to frequent here."}
{"text":"The food was horrible. We came in at 8pm and there was no one in the restaurant. The steak was not cooked and the meat tasted like gum. It did not taste fresh and everything was cold. The servers were nice but I mean, the food was horrendous."}
{"text":"I don't expect much from Chili's and I eat there once or twice a month. However tonight I ordered a flat bread and it was terrible. It was soggy and undercooked and I had to send it back. The bartender was apologetic and offered to give me something else, but didn't take it off the bill. Definitely disappointed."}
{"text":"Yeah, I know it's a chain restaurant with average food and average \"everything\"...  Usually I wouldn't even review it, because they are all the same but this was decidedly worse. I eat at Chili's, Applebee's, TGIF's, etc... occasionally and I am never really impressed, but mostly satisfied because like all chains, you usually know what you are getting and have expectations that are average.    This was below par.. I was the first customer for lunch. The server/bartender was \"phony\" friendly, and the whole staff was talking loudly about their personal lives and generally being obnoxious.   Soup was as expected... Then the burger came out..... Working in a restaurant 9 years definitely made it evident that the meat was precooked, and left in the fridge overnight or longer and then was attempted to be cooked again.  It was actually hard on the outside and pure rubber inside.  The bun was grilled and black charcoal burned on one end... I almost never send food back, but this was inedible.  They made another one and the manager said they had the grill turned too high... Not true but I know they couldn't tell me the truth... Haha"}
{"text":"Friday night, 530pm, don't usually come to chilis but had a gift card. Was pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious. I had one green chili enchilada and one red beef enchilada. My husband had steak fajitas. Both our dishes came with rice and black beans. The rice was bland but the beans and our dishes were delicious. We also both had the new strawberry limeade and it was also delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice to visit now and then, food is consistent and new offerings often.  Reasonable service and cold beer."}
{"text":"Horrible experience food was terrible wouldn't feed it to my dog! Steak over cooked over charged just piss poor"}
{"text":"It has been a year since we were last at chili's because of prior experiences but I was really craving their nachos. We had a great experience this time! Are waitress was attentive the food was perfectly timed and all tasted great! No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Decent food however the restaurant is always disheveled. Napkins on the floor, tables not cleared quickly, and the bathroom usually looks like a small tornado whipped through. Other than some soggy bread on occasion the food is OK. Waitstaff seem friendly enough but also often disheveled as well."}
{"text":"Right around the corner so it is unfortunate food is so poor.  Service was improved the last time but 3 bad experiences overall lead us to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ok service but they over cooked my burger to ultimate dryness. They turned the cheese to a solid chunk. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Amazing Experience The Food was Great well prepared and look very Good Jason was and amazing Server  and Carylon was fantastic  ansd Jasmine the host  is the best staff they have here in Tempe"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was great.  Waiter kept checking on us. First time we have eaten at this location.  My family and I enjoyed our meal.  And will be back.  The atmosphere was inviting and pleasant."}
{"text":"Giving three stars may be a bit generous. Today, I ordered carside to-go. My husband got an appetizer and I ordered my entree (enchiladas) plus broccoli & mashed potatoes. We arrived at chili's exactly 5 minutes past the time we were given to pick up. My home is not even a 5 minute drive. The food was cold. Not Luke warm, cold, when we got it home. On top of that, the broccoli that I ordered as a side (with seasoned salt-I might add) was not only missing the seasoned salt but was not cooked. Not even remotely close to cooked.  But my first complaint, although the lesser important would have to be that (my husband I both worked at chili's in the past in Las Vegas.) we were not greeted at carside pickup. The man didn't even acknowledge that we were in the car. When I said hello he nodded. He then handed me the drinks and shoved the food into my car, and with no other words, (not even a response to my thank you) he walked off."}
{"text":"I normally don't post reviews because I'm the type of person who is easily pleased. But I am now because this is the first time I've walked out of a restaurant for not getting served. The staff seemed nice enough when they asked why we were leaving but the fact that they approached us for the first time in the 10-15 we sat waiting for someone to approach us to take our order was unacceptable."}
{"text":"If I could give lower than 1 star I would. A guest and I came in for dinner, it wasn't all that busy. The boy who was serving us was not helpful in the least. We ended up waiting over an hour for our food to come out (and I had to remind him). A family of 8 came in after us..and they got their meals served before us. I was furious at this point. The manager comes over in complete defense mode..defending the boy server..he forgot to put our order in. When our food finally comes out.. my order is wrong. I proceed to tell the manager..she said that she'd be right back with the correct side. I'm waiting..and waiting.. 20 minutes go by and I see her walking around with her staff laughing. Never brought me what I needed. The food was horrific. The staff is inconsistent. The manager is rude..a poor excuse of a manager if you ask me. I will never go back here. And I don't recommend anyone to waist their money here."}
{"text":"Service and food was good. New black cherry  lemonade was meh. I'll stick with strawberry next time."}
{"text":"It's Chili's.  It's what you expect, but if you've never been there, let me give you the run down.  I always order the chips and salsa.  Chips are fresh, thin and usually warm, if they are not ask for new ones.  The salsa is flavorful without being overwhelming with heat.  I will more than likely order the boneless Buffalo wings - you get a fair amount and again the flavor is there with the overpowering heat.  The burgers are good, quality beef with a fresh bun.  They have steak fries.  I'm a fan of small fries but don't hate these.  Great Happy Hour deals.  The place is usually clean and I really like sitting in the bar with the friendly staff and many TV's to watch."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, standard chain restaurant food, but acceptable. The service here is always above average and professional.  The ribs are pretty tasty and try the loaded boneless wings."}
{"text":"We have gotten take out from this location a few times and it's always missing things or put in the wrong boxes with the wrong sides, etc. One time we ordered queso to go and it looked and tasted more like refried beans than queso. It was absolutely disgusting. We recently decided to dine in and watch football on a Sunday though, hoping for a better experience. Unfortunately, we had no such luck. The bartender, Jarrod, was offensive, rude and belligerent the entire time. He made some borderline racist comments, tried WAY too hard to be funny but just came off as an ass instead, cussed repeatedly and put down customers and their sports teams to their faces. Jarrod definitely wasn't the type of employee I imagine Chili's hiring and putting up with and believe they would be just as shocked at his behavior behind the bar as we were. In fact, the overall organization and service at this establishment is an embarrassment to Chili's and should be evaluated. In the mean time, if you're looking for quality food, cooked to your specification, go somewhere else, or drive to the litchfield Park Chili's instead. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"It stinks in this place,  not food stink, but dirty smelly, wet rug stink. Went in for lunch, had a drink walked out..  The smell was that bad.  Yuk!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying it's a Chili's, it in no way is fancy, mind blowing , or amazing.  The wife and I go to this location pretty regularly it's our local spot , cheap date night ( 2 for 35 ) close to home.   This location is clean , and we'll staffed. The waiting staff is better than most chain restaurants, they are quick and thoughtful. Staff regularly comes by and asks how we are doing , they remember my wife and I and really make it feel like a neighborhood family style restaurant.  The food , it's not bad can honestly say never had a bad meal at this location , food is always hot and tasty. I am a big fan of the Cajun chicken pasta , and Texas cheese fries. We normally do the 2 for $35 , you get 2 margaritas,  a starter , 2 meals , and a desert. It's a great deal.   So all in all its good , we keep going back and we will probably continue to."}
{"text":"Although the meal was good, the service was lacking. Our waitress was also tending bar and that was the problem. We were sitting at a high table in the bar and took way to long to get our bill to us."}
{"text":"Usually the service here is great! But tonight's visit left something to be desired... The server came by 1 time to give us a free refill...that was it... Not a once did he come by to see if we were doing ok, maybe they were short handed, I don't know. But we would probably sit where we normally do in the restaurant side... As we sat in the bar side tonight, maybe that was the difference??)"}
{"text":"So, I was hanging out with a friend on this side of town and we decided to grab some food, and we ended up here, at Chili's on a Sunday afternoon.  For starters, the place wasn't to busy, which was greati. After reviewing the menu, I realized they had happy hour specials all day long in Sunday. Bonus!  They had a nice but small selection of alcoholic beverages to choose from, but since I was driving, I had to pass on those. Notated that in the future, I can come here any given sunday and get some food and booze for cheap!  I went with the buffalo wings and the free happy hour chips, and my friend got the triple plate where you could sample a few things, which he liked. It actually looked really good!  Drinks were always topped off and full, along with the few other requests that we had, like extra ranch dressing and some napkins.    The service was pretty good, but I felt a bit rushed at the end.  The server was polite and all, but he asked us like 3 times of we were done. Um, yes, and no, I don't want my food cleared right away! He gave us our bill and we sat there for a bit. I mean, it wasn't busy so there wasn't a wait or anything and I don't know what his hurry was.   Since I'm stuffed beyond words, I would say it was actually a really nice experience overall.  They had a few different games on the TV's throughout the bar, so that was a nice distraction during our lunch/dinner.  Overall, not a half bad experience. What a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon, and I really enjoyed my time here."}
{"text":"The service is VERY slow. 15 minutes to receive the drinks. 45 minutes to receive the dinner. She only checked up on us once. The dinners were good though. the salad was on the wilty side."}
{"text":"This restaurant is hit or miss with customer service.   The waiters and waitresses need to be keeping there eye out for the dirty plates, silverware and glasses.   It's pathetic when a customer has to ask for a clean item.  Yes your tip will suffer a little.  The other issue they continually have is serving warm salad on a warm plate.   A salad should be crisp and served on a cold chilled plate.   The fajitas came out not sizzling!!! There's a problem with that.  The meat should be at least warm.  I notice there ratings continue to drop.  We are going to just drive out of our way to the one on Power road North of the 60 freeway."}
{"text":"We are at Chilis today. We were seated promptly by hostess at south side of restaurant.  The table was dirty with dead flies on the table and dead flies in the window seal.  The booth seats had food on them.  The menus are dirty with sticky food residue on them. The back of the kiosk had red sticky substance on it.   I called hostess back over and asked if we could get the table cleaned. She got a rag and wiped the table done, leaving dead-flies in our window.   The waiter was friendly and prompt with our orders. The salads came out on warm plates.  The salads tasted good.  This location is hit or miss with chilled plates and clean tables."}
{"text":"Revoke my foodie card, but I happen to love Chili's.  The free chips and salsa during Happy Hour in the bar, plus some chipotle bbq wings and skillet queso always hit the spot for me.  Plus when my midwestern family comes to visit, they don't want any food they don't recognize (grooooan) so Chili's is a safe bet.  This location is fast and friendly, but there's no wifi -- and it cost them a whole star from me.  Applebee's is the same price and quality, so why do they offer free wifi and Chili's won't?  I guess they don't want us hanging out there any longer than we have to eat and run.  Turn them tables, folks!"}
{"text":"Food is always good. I always sit in the bar area and beware, it's always freezing. I like it cold but holy crap you shiver when you eat, even in the summer!"}
{"text":"Not a very good Chili's location. Chips and salsa were over cooked. Sunrise burger: patty was over cooked and the egg was raw."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Have not been there for a while. Usually I would give then a 3 or 4 star. But not this time.  We where seated promptly and that is the last positive thing that was done. Server finally came about five minutes later and took our drink order. Ten  minutes later drinks finally came. He then disappeared. We waited over 15 minutes and he never showed up. I went to the dinning room host to ask where the server was. Another five minutes he came and took our order. We waited and waited for our food to come and the server was no where to be found. Finally I got up again and he was taking another order right behind me. Now we have been in the restaurant for over 45 minutes. He finally brought the food. You could tell it had been sitting in the heat lamp for quite a while.  He never came back to see if we needed refills or anything else.  The food usually quite good. My wife and daughter had no complaints but mine, I had steak fajitas. The steak was as tough as nails. I did not want to have it replaced as It could have taken  another half hour. The toppings that come with them is a joke. There was so little salsa it could not be even a spoon full. After this experience needless to say the tip was what the server deserved. I probably will return but if the service is not improved I  will just not go there I will try the new Red Robing just down the street."}
{"text":"Food: it's the usual food that you would find at a Chili's, crappy, tasteless and lacking of nutrition. But it's the airport, is there anything better?  Service: S. U. C. K. Y. I don't even think the server wanted to be there.   Value: Not worth it.   I think that's the best I can do to not make you waste time in this place."}
{"text":"We ordered using the Chili's app at 725pm The app said our order would be ready at 755. We arrived at the restaurant at 750, parked in the \"to go\" waiting for our curbside delivery. At 805 we went in to check on if maybe our order was put in wrong or we selected the wrong delivery . There were other to go customers in line as well. None of our orders were even started. We waited an additional 10 minutes, got our order without even an apology. When we got home, we noticed our order was wrong- nothing critical- but still not accurate. The food wasn't that great either."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday lunch after church. I was with a 9year old, so having the new tablet with games at each table on it kept her occupied, which was nice. They were busy so our server was a little distant, and hard to get a hold of. That was a bit annoying, but the food is always good here in my opinion. Of course I will always be back, because I love the food :)"}
{"text":"Stopped into this Chili's for a quick dinner on a Sat night. They had been advertising their fajitas in ads and mentioned that they would be larger than they used to be  and would come to your table sizzling in a skillet.  Sounded good, so we ordered the one with three meats, which was about $17. It took almost 30 min to come out of the kitchen and not only was it not sizzling but the meat wasn't even that hot when it arrived at our table. The worst part is that the restaurant was half empty! I used to work at a few restaurants and when the food comes out of the kitchen and is barely warm it means their servers aren't running out the food like they should. The secret to restaurants always serving fresh, hot meals is having \"runners\" constantly bringing food out of the kitchen. This reflects poorly on the management at this location! So does the 2.5 star average rating on Yelp!  To make matters worse, the fajitas arrived at our table with a very small plate that had the sour cream, guac, pico and cheese. There was a tiny amount of each and not enough for the huge skillet full of meat, peppers and onions. When I asked the server for more he said it would be an additional $2!   Needless to say, I was VERY disappointed in this Chili's and wouldn't recommend it to anyone! On The Border is a few miles away on Power Rd and they do a WAY better job with their fajitas!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Ordered the honey chipotle chicken crispers & waffles. Service was good. Food was very tasty. Loved the food I ordered & fills you up which is good."}
{"text":"Baby back rub were terrible.  Service at call ahead pickup was awful.  It took 10 minutes to find my order in the computer after they had my food."}
{"text":"I posted this on Facebook on 02/19/2016 : Let me share my experience what happened this week alone . I place a order To Go. I go to pick it up, I admit I was not happy of what my order looked like. It looked nothing like the pics I saw on line, not even close. The problem this one rude ass, smart ass little staffer who I had one bad experience before. She brings me my order, I was not happy , ready to leave without taking or paying for my order and as I was ready to walk out the door, this little girl says loud enough for me to hear with my back turned with such malice, rudeness and hate in her voice \" Hmmm you are never happy anyway every time you come here anyway hhmm \". I turned around in shock and honestly could not believe my ears. I was already walking away and she started to fight with me. I said \"Excuse me , I would like to speak with a manager please \". She got some chubby looking I tried to explain why I was upset ( for what she said to me as I was again already walking away. ) Bottom line as the end, she lied through her teeth about me and had the nerve to bring in my husband , who was not even with me at the time, in to the conversation. WTF !!!! She said again with a attitude \" You are always upset, that is why your husband came to pick it up the last time \". Are you kidding me !!!!!! Manager did NOTHING ! He allowed her to disrespect me like this. He DID NOTHING . He did not take ownership for this girl's unprofessional attitude and just plain rudeness. This girl clearly does not know what Customer Service is. I reached out to Chilli's Corp office, finally got a call today from some dude in Texas , I got no where with him,. This fool already made up his mind that he took the worker's side !! WTF !!! He all but stated he would not take any action against the worker or manager. It's me who is the problem not the worker. Chilli's You lost a valued , loyal customer forever . I BANNED YOU. I WILL NEVER , EVER GO TO ANTHER'S CHILI'S EVER AGAIN. You allow the staff there to treat customers like #hit and get away with it. YOU SUCK . Management needs to take ownership of the mistreatment of customers like myself. Like I said I was already walking away when this clearly unhappy, ugly girl said what she said to me behind my back & then she brings my husband in to the conversation, he was not even with me. I expected and wanted a apology from her, the manager at this Chili's ( 75th Ave & Encanto in Phx, AZ ) refused to have her do it. He needs to man up and take ownership. People be aware ...Just saying . Chili's Management DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS at all who pay good money to eat and drink at Chili's. I left there and went straight across to Olive Garden who treated me like family, they hooked us up. They know how to treat people. I should have known better . #Chilisneedstodoalotbetter #customersfirst"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I we love it here! We order the mango chicken and the hickory smoked sirloin!!"}
{"text":"We used to eat at this Chili's location regularly but it started to go downhill so we stopped. We decided to try to again about two months and go and have either ate in or got take out at least 7/8 times since and every time it's been spot on and delicious! It's back to what it used to be. The chicken enchilada soup is amazing as usual! The fajitas are also great. The original chicken crispers are as good as they were years ago! My boyfriend usually gets a burger and is always satisfied. If you stopped going like us, I'd recommend you give it another try!"}
{"text":"Simply put slow service, ribs were cold, fries were super salty. Not impressed but the honey mustard is on point."}
{"text":"Typical tex-mex chain restaurant. Average food at reasonable prices. Service was good."}
{"text":"Generally, I like Chili's. I don't know if the problem is with this particular location, or if the chain is on the decline.  For one thing, I won't order delivery through Grub Hub from this location any longer. They refuse even the simplest of requests.  Second, apparently no one really cooks at this Chili's. Everything is premeasured, prepackaged, pre-everything, so you can't say, no onions please. Too bad. It comes with onions.  I do not normally write reviews for mediocre restaurants, but tonight took the cake. Went in at 10:20 after a long day at the office. A kid was screaming at the top of his lungs. I asked not to be seated next to the screaming child. I was told that was the only place available, because all the other sections were closed.  I looked around an empty restaurant with a table that held a screaming child, and asked why I couldn't be seated at one of the many empty tables in the place. According to the host, it doesn't work that way.  So I turned around and left and went to Applebee's. Where there was also a screaming child. But at Applebee's, they had the great good sense to recognize that as annoying to other diners; they managed to find a quiet table - without my having to ask.  Tipping point: Chili's has lost my business."}
{"text":"We arrived for lunch around 11:30. The place only had 3 other tables with customers, very small groups. There were 4 adults, 2 children, 1 baby in our group. Our waitress was very quick to ask us what we would like to drink. Our drinks were served promptly, however after that our prompt waitress disappeared for over 10 minutes before seeing if we were ready to order. We placed our order and waited over a 1/2 hour before the two kids meals were brought out, and to top it off the food was not hot. We then waited another 20 minutes for the 4 adult meals. The fry's were cold and the chicken tortilla soup was not very good. How we can not blame our waitress for the slow preparation of our food as she was very attentive after we ordered by keeping us filled on chips and salsa while we waited and waited. Food was about a 3 1/2 star waitress 4 and wait time a 0."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent Chili's. The food at all Chili's locations are the same so you know what you're getting going into this. We came around 2pm with a large party of 7. I was happy to find that we didn't have to wait at all to be seated.  I had the chips and salsa for an appetizer and the Buffalo Ranch Chicken Sandwich for my appetizer. All the food I had was good. Service was also prompt. Our waiter checked on us often and was quick with refills. I would come back to this location if I was wanting Chili's again in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered on line curb side to go. The app said that the order did not go through. But the credit card company said the payment was made. When we checked on the order it had not gone through. Someone named Rachel was rude and non communicative to us. So we asked for the manager and Chris was excellent. We got it straightened out but it was a big hassle. Thanks to him we are eating our lunch and not screaming at stupid staff people at Chili's."}
{"text":"Basically going to be writing a review for the table near me as they flagged down their waitress with both of their arms flying in the air, and she just walked passed them. They have a system where you can literally order, push a button for refills, and pay for the check on a little tablet that is placed on each table. Therefore, service was literally nonexistent, and servers are getting paid to just bring out food. The food tasted average. It's what expected of a chain."}
{"text":"Very poor service.  Waited 15 minutes and finally had to ask for a waiter to take our drink order.  Assumed it would take another 15 plus minutes to get the waiter to return so we also placed our food order.  Noticed other patrons around us not happy with the service they were getting.  Once the food was brought out there some errors in what we ordered.  One meal had beef when chicken was ordered.  Half the chips were soaked with salsa.    Now at the end of our meal, staff are smoking outside the Order Out door with the door held open."}
{"text":"When we walked in no one greeted us nor the group in front of us!  Actually no one was even out on the floor at all.  We actually thought they had a meeting going in the back or something smh.  Finally someone came out, made eye contact with us and then proceeded to sweep the floor!  Eventually that same person came over to us and said \"how many?\" No (sorry about the wait) or nothing just a monotone \"how many?\"    So he sat us and we waited for the server and waited and waited and waited.  We decided just to leave! We then started reading reviews of the place in the car and notice that they had a ton of negative reviews from African Americans but great reviews from whites. See for yourself...."}
{"text":"Got wings and salads to go a few evenings back. Food was so good went back two days later and was just as happy as the first time. Was really surprised as take out food so often gets real soggy by the time you get it home. Was well packed, so no soggy food. Their molten chocolate cake is the best!"}
{"text":"I couldn't do one of the surveys on the machine because ours broke, but I wanted to take the time to give a about out to our waitress. Julz was fantastic and very friendly. Really enjoyed the atmosphere and food. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Good meal here as well. Good value on Chili oldtimer burger.  I like their chips and salsa. Carribean salad is good. Sometimes we split the burger and salad. We like the Presidential margarita with rum substituted. Good take out operation as well."}
{"text":"Rarely, if ever, disappointed in this Chili's.  Good food, fast service, and everything you expect from this well-known chain.  Never too crowded and rarely a wait, ever.  I take off one whole star because it is FREEZING in this place and not just one time.  Every time I eat here, I freeze.  I and friends on several occasions have gone to our cars and gotten sweaters and coats.  Also, the partner servers are kind of silly.  Just give me one person so that they will actually remember what I asked for.  It makes it a super causal dining experience having multiple waiters.  Last night, had a delicious Raspberry Presidente Margarita and they left the shaker with quite a large drink..... all for under $8.  I'm sold by that."}
{"text":"I usually HATE these kinds of chain restaurants but the service here has always been so amazing that I have no choice but to give them 4 stars~ I like doing the 2 for $20 deal with my man and we always get the guacamole and chips as an appetizer. The chips are so thin & yummy! I do believe that they have a happy hour as well so maybe I'll check them out for that!"}
{"text":"It's Chili's, what can you say?  Staff is friendly and lunch specials are great."}
{"text":"A little better than an Applebee's or Fridays but basically the same restaurant. I like the new additions to the menu and they have really stepped it up with the new burger options they have. A good spot to stop by for a burger and beer. We will visit this location again in the future."}
{"text":"I don't know what chilis has done with their menu but it is barely one step above mcdonalds. Horrible service, forever to get drinks, waitress ignored us and food is terrible. Will never go to chilis again. Worst ribs I have ever had.  I don't know what sickly pig they cut them from but they probably shouldn't have been consumed by humans."}
{"text":"I was missing the Chili's back in Massachusetts where I used to live so I decided to go and see how this certain one was. I was a bit disappointed for sure. I love that the beer comes out in chilled mugs, but they don't have the temperature right here since I got frozen bits at the top of my beer. I also am really missing the awesome blossom and was sad to see that it was not on this menu. My friend and I got the  2 for $20 dinner. I got the margarita chicken which was just meh and my friend got the Cajun chicken pasta, which besides the good chicken, not that great. As an appetizer we got the Texas fries and those were the best thing we had all night. I may come back and get what I used to get back home, the steak fajitas. Maybe."}
{"text":"Not too sure why all the bad reviews.   I love this place.  Steak fajitas is always a must for me.  And not to mention the Coronarita as a perfect match.   Hee hee.   Kids meals are only 4.99!  They have a screen on your table for you to reorder drinks that has unlimited games you or the kids can play while you wait for only 99 cents.  You can even use it to pay your bill!"}
{"text":"The food was actually good.  What I didn't like was how freakin' slow the service was.  I met up with a friend for lunch and it took almost an hour and half even though we ordered right away and ate quickly.   They have some really decent lunch combos so I would go back just for that, and also let our server know we only have an hour!  My friend ordered an avocado chicken sandwich that looked really good.  He said it was awesome except that it was supposed to come with fries and he got maybe 8 total fries.  It really looked like someone had been eating them before we got the food.  I ordered a lunch combo that came with a side salad and chicken fajitas.  Nothing special but they weren't bad.  It's an ok lunch spot."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food was better than expected, with two IPAs on draft and a few local beer options."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this specific location 2 stars. My family and I were very excited to come here and try their legendary chicken crispers and Cajun pasta. In that regard, the chicken crispers were pretty good but it was very greasy and the Cajun pasta upon arrival was cold to the touch. When I told my waiter it seemed that he would be very accommodating and said they'd remake it. But, when it came back it was very obviously just reheated. I work in the food industry so I understand that usually when they take it back they reheat it but I was expecting it to be remade, because he said they would. Nonetheless, he was very kind to take it off the bill. Overall, the workers NEED TO WORK ON THEIR COMMUNICATION, SPECIFICALLY SERVER TO COOK!! My younger sister ordered corn on the Cobb instead of fries but when it was brought out, it was still fries. I will not be going back to this location but I won't write off all Chili's, I hope they improve."}
{"text":"We were seated and ordered drinks tight away. Then no one came to ask about our food order. We were not in a big hurry but after 25 minutes our waiter Will never even looked at us. We finally got a new waiter to respond to us and got food ordered. It took us over an hour to eat and at no time did any one in management talk to us or make any adjustments to our bill."}
{"text":"I eat at Chili's all the time.  While I prefer supporting small, local businesses - when you have difficult personalities/eaters in play - sometimes it is easier to just go to a \"known\" restaurant so people don't get their panties in a bunch.  Chili's seems to go one of two ways - GREAT, or awful.  This experience was pretty great!  We stopped in for lunch on a whim (between meetings for work) and ordered a couple of lunch specials.  Let me tell you, I paid fast food prices for an AMAZING half BLT, great fries, and a side salad.  My co-worker ordered the flat bread and got a side salad as well.  The food was HOT, it was well-presented, tasty, and did I mention it was priced well?  :)  The only \"issue\" that arose was our drinks didn't get refilled in the most timely manner, but they did get refilled.  I am pretty good about keeping a \"reserve\" but some people I dine with aren't.  I was really surprised, given the location, that the restaurant was clean, the staff were all pleasant, and that the food was so good.  If you are afraid to eat in this neck of the woods, this Chili's is a good bet!"}
{"text":"Chili's used to be one of my favorite restaurants for a beer ribs or some relaxed atmosphere, we'll all of that being said chilli's is now the epitome of a Dennie's lesser and I quote because I just herd it here \"ghetto fabulous restaurant \"and in my opinion the fabulous has left the building along with the rib's, fajita's decent glass of tea that doesn't smell fishy, thanks chilli's for the coupons to get me to come back and remember why I don't come here anymore!"}
{"text":"I probably won't be back here.  We had to grab our own silverware from a bucket, our waitress was always quick to bring food then leave immediately. We had to somewhat yell to get her attention last night. When my salad was bad, she didnt offer a different dish, but took it quickly and said they'll remake it. It took twenty minutes to do this, which is when my boyfriend was done eating. Though i appreciate it was remade, we weren't offered a discount or dessert on the house or anything.  We got boxes, paid at the table and left very disappointed in the experience."}
{"text":"Inconsistent. Close to home so I would occasionally order pickup or delivery. My last order arrived with no sides and totally incomplete. I obviously notified postmates but also called the restaurant as I ordered $40 worth of food and for example got a burger, bun and patty only no toppings no fries. Fried pickles had no ranch when ordered extra. Honey chipotle tenders also had no fries. Spoke to a manager that told me I could bring back the food in an annoyed tone or she could mail me something for next time. When giving my address clearly was not writing it down and it's now been 3 weeks and nothing has came. I gave a chance and plenty of time. Another customer lost. I'd give zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch at Chili's. It was busy but we were sat quickly because our party was small. We both had a cheeseburger and fries. They brought our food out pretty fast was good and reasonably priced. .. .. will come back again... waitress was great too!"}
{"text":"We ordered Nacho's which came out soggy with overcooked toppings. The Guacamole was brown which we refused, they said it was the last one from an earlier time? Really? The staff were very friendly which is why 2 stars and not 1 star. The manager gave a free order to go which was nice of her, but they took 20 minutes to come out and still soggy. Not the best item for carryout after 20 minutes on a good day. The place was clean, the staff were nice. My suggestion would be to order a burger or something else."}
{"text":"Was sat at a table in the dining area where we proceeded to wait well over 15 minutes. We were not greeted by a server, winked at, waved at, or anything. All of the tables surrounding us were dirty. Our drink orders were never taken and service was awful. This was at 8 pm, well past dinner rush hour. Poor service and this isn't the first time."}
{"text":"I want to thank Angela our server for her great service and honesty!  After having a few drinks lol .I unfortunately forgot my wallet that had alot of cash and everything thing else that is a pain in the ass to replace. It was several hours later I realized I left my wallet there we made it back in the nick of time before closing and the manager Eric had it safe and sound in the office !! Thank you so much!  We will see you again and ask for Angie as our server"}
{"text":"We came here for a hearty meal after giving blood and did the 2 for $20. The food was delicious, and we were greeted with quick and great customer service. Savanna was our server and Dustin also helped carry our food over. They were so delightful - Savanna was so pleasant and always made sure we were being taken care of and had exactly what we needed even before we needed it. I HIGHLY recommend this Chili's as we had a great experience! (:"}
{"text":"I used to love Chili's - the fajitas were always sizzling hot and fresh. The past few times we had gone - the food was not great and the service was slow. It seems like they change up the salsa every month, so nothing is the same. Rice is the same way - it changes per month - you never know what you are going to get.  It seems like drinks have also gotten weaker - but the prices keep creeping up. The servers seem to be thrown around in various jobs, which then affect the way they keep up with actually serving the customers. Not sure what is going on - I think they need a better management style."}
{"text":"I recently dined here at the Paradise Valley Chili's location and was so pleasantly surprised by my entire dining experience! It looked to me like there was a new updated look to the entire restaurant.  (I had been there last year) My husband and I stayed for over an hour and the flavorful food came out to us hot and quickly!  I think our server's name was Melissa. Cute smile and very friendly! We will definitely make this our regular stop now, especially after shopping at the mall. Not just because of the food and decor and service, but it was extremely clean, and that's important to me. Thanks Chili's. See you soon!"}
{"text":"I will never return to this chilis again!!! Valerie our waitress was by far the worst and I have never been so insulted in my life by anyone like her . I told her that she wasn't very attentive to our table and we needed the soup warmer the wings were under cooked and my chicken on my salad wasn't cooked good and her response was well your kids were screaming !!! Btw my daughter cried once because she dropped her crayon she's 1!! I guess chilis isn't family friendly !"}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here frequently with my husband and kids! I love the food, and my kids love the tablets lol I've been waited on by a lot of different servers but my favorite is Greg. He goes above and beyond what anyone needs to do. He always makes our visits here great! This is the only restaurant that I can say I've never had a bad experience at, no matter how busy it is or difficult the order might be. Some of your other locations could definitely benefit from whatever you are doing here. Thanks for being awesome!"}
{"text":"Wait time should be changed to an hour to 1.5 hr. The sevice is terrible. People can't clean the tables and a lot of the staff just stands around doing nothing."}
{"text":"Had the 2 for $20.00 deal. Ordered the fried cheese sticks. How stupid to serve 7 sticks for 2 people.  Make it 6 or 8 . The wait staff works as \"teams\". What a dumb idea. There are small interactive tv devices on each table. All orders can be placed with these devices.  The wait staff is only needed to carry the food from the kitchen to the tables. Need extra napkins? Forget it.  Caution the charge for playing a game on this device is 99 cents. The baby back ribs are totally tasteless. The sweet potato fries did come out without salt,as I requested. The silverware is spotted and dirty.Skip the desserts, over priced and devoid of flavor. This is my second trip to this restaurant. ..my first and last. Do yourself a big favor and go to Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"They've really gone down hill with food quality. I have no idea what they do with their chicken,  ie fajitas,  margarita grilled chicken,  and other grilled chicken meals. They taste like plastic or rubber, premade possibly frozen. Definitely not fresh cooked to order.  Its so bad we will never go back."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was okay. We sat in the bar section on a Saturday night. It was super loud, and made us feel like we were in a sports bar.  The 2 for 20 meal is awesome and filled us both up! Beside the blaring TVs, it was freezing! Wearing a jacket, and jeans. Super uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Melissa our bartender was on point. So happy to see such a friendly face and superb service. Melissa sets the bar high when it comes to customer service. Our food was excellent, prompt and delicious. Thanks for being our neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"Last Thursday (around 6pm) I went to Chilis with my roommates for dinner as we were celebrating our end to the semester! We are all in customer service. I work retail/bartend and one of the two is currently a waitress.   I haven't received such poor service in a long time. My waitress had an assistant who did all of her work. We were ignored and never greeted or asked how we were doing.  We counted how many times the waitress and the assistant walked passed our table while we had dishes piling up and empty water glasses. 4 total before I flagged the HOSTESS down to retrieve our waitress so we could get the check. They forgot to bring out a side of one of the dishes, they didn't bring condiments when we politely asked.   When the waitress did come over to abruptly fill our water glasses or to bring the late dish of mashed potatos it was never kind. We felt like we were being ignored and that we were annoying the waitress.   The three of us are early twenties. So we understand having waiters treat us differently because they assume we don't tip. Though this is the first time in all of my life I have left a $0 tip. If I like my service I'll provide above and beyond gratitude.   I understand things get hectic in a restaraunt and the staff that night could have be understaffed. But that is no reason for the employees to not be polite to their customers. We would have been okay with an apology for slow service or a warning that things will be nuts. We didn't get that much respect.   I would provide the name of my waitress. Though that would mean I actually got one. If I could provide less than 1/5 Stars I would. But I think the $0 tips from my roommates and I and the poor surveys we left on their \"anti-customer service monitors\" they leave on the table.  I will not be returning to this Chilis.  P.s. Food was amazing. Restaraunt was clean.  P.p.s. This was my first terrible experience at this specific restaurant. I have gone and ate at the bar before and have had great experience with their service. If you choose to done at this location avoid the section by the bathrooms that's where we got discarded."}
{"text":"Slow Service! This is a usually spot for us, the last 2 times we have been here we have waited over an hour for our food after ordering. The wait staff just keeps saying its coming out now, no manager ever comes to check on the table to see how service is. To say the least until this place gets better service we will find a new usual place to eat."}
{"text":"Food was good. Chips were crushed and salsa tasted like pickles but everything else was great. I love the game system on the tables. Perfect way to keep kids busy while waiting for food. Server Nate was excellent."}
{"text":"Typical Chili's quality food but horrible service. After waiting for 10 minutes we flagged down the manager to place our order. Restaurant was not busy and plenty of staff, just disorganized. They were real attentive for most of the meal, (except for the server), but when it came time to leave we waited for quite awhile to get a to go box, only after we went to the hostess stand to ask for one. Should have looked at the Yelp reviews prior to going in. Recently moved to the neighborhood but won't be back. An hour and a half for a quick bite to eat in a restaurant that was 25% full and fully staffed was not in our plans."}
{"text":"I'm not even back to the car yet and I'm writing this review. Very motivated. We stopped here driving back to Atlanta from a trip to NY. Stopped for a quick, easy dinner. I'm not even going to bother going into huge, long paragraphs for this awful place. My wife ordered a salad with grilled shrimp. The shrimp were raw. Completely raw. Sent it back. Came back, still waaaaay undercooked. She's diabetic and already took insulin so she had to eat. They didn't bother having the manager come by. Nothing. Just, \"well, enjoy your ride home!\"  Awful place. Just awful. There are PLENTY of other restaurant that deserve your business in this same shopping center. We are now eating a good meal at Moe's across the parking lot. If I could give this Chili's location negative three stars, I would."}
{"text":"Jenn working in the bar is the greatest thing that has happen to this location! She has the best customer service I've ever had! She is a genuine, caring server going out of her way to make sure you have all you need! Also her margarita is amazing! And to top it off she has manners! I just appreciate the service I received from her! I'll drive straight passes any Chili's location to have Jenn take care of me!"}
{"text":"This is your regular Chili's.  The wait on the weekend in the evenings is average 20-40 minutes. The food is decent, haven't had anything bad, and their Ribs are always delicious. Service was prompt and polite.  It is by a mall and is one of the more convenient places to get to, but I would probably lean towards somewhere else as I prefer more exotic foods.  Great place for kids however."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!! The service was great but the Santa Fe Chicken salad dressing was way too spicy, our mouths were on fire. What is the staffs problem, we had been to Chili's before at other locations and had a wonderful experience, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Worst Chili's ever. No service. Don't order to go. They will ignore you. Worst experience ever. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"One star because it's the less I can give them the worst service ever I came to celebrate my birthday with my family we were 5 and sit for about 5 minutes and  2 employees saw innumerable times they didn't even greet us ... none of them!!!! Then another couple came in and they didn't lost a second to greet them they kept ignoring us how you do this really !!!????? So we decided to walked out and they still ignored us worst service ever!!!!!! Not even greet your costumer never NEVER COMING BACK ( and I really loved this place to choose it for my birthday)....."}
{"text":"Poor service once again, several empty tables, so it's not that busy where we should be ignored by our waiter.  When my drink is empty I consider it a bad thing.  My son' drink was emptied half way through his meal, we would have ordered him more but we never saw the waiter.  Steve was in attentive and as we finished out meal all four if our glasses were empty.  I'm sorry that's not good in my book.  He didn't offer dessert he asked if we were all finished.  I think we found another restaurant to mark off our list.  Food was good though!"}
{"text":"Just left Chilis on Chandler Blvd. I ordered the fajitas. Do not order.  The entire skillet was onions and green peppers.  There were 4 little slices of chicken and even smaller slices of steak.  When I asked the waiter,  he said the meat was cut thick and it was the same amount. I am extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good atmosphere, good drinks, good prices, but best of all, they have a good clean bathroom..woohoo!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't review this place when I was there two months ago. Fortunately for me, I was just passing through the area and will never be back to this Chili's location.   I had driven about 13 hours from the twin cities area and stopped in Macedonia on the way to New York. Stayed in a nearby hotel and this restaurant fit the bill for a quick normal dinner I could have with my young daughter before going to sleep. I ordered a salad, soup and a beer. My daughter got the kids menu Mac and cheese, which is supposedly just Kraft brand. We've eaten at Chili's dozens of times at home and figured we would be fine here. We were wrong.   Her mac and cheese was undercooked with crunchy noodles. She wouldn't eat it. She just had fries for dinner as a result. My soup was the only edible part of the meal. My salad had filthy bits of lettuce that hadn't been washed.   My beer... this is the really insane part. I asked for a recommendation of whatever they had on tap, a short glass, not a tall. I am very beer friendly and just wanted a small one after the brutal drive of the day. What I was brought was a tall mug of a beer I don't recall the name of. The girl who dropped it off was not the server who took our order and that's fine, seems to be a normal thing. Not an issue. Notable however because she tried to present this beer to me as a gift after I said I had just ordered a short. She told me they would just have to pour it out so I may as well have it and enjoy it. So I naturally thought \"why not?\"  THE KICKER:  I went to take a sip of this enormous gift of beer and it had SOMEONE ELSE'S LIPSTICK on the rim. Like a full bottom lip print in lipstick. This girl didn't return. Our server didn't return. I flagged down the first person I could find and had it switched out. The girl came by and asked where the beer was, she said \"oh they didn't let you keep it?\"  So I told her it had been sampled by someone wearing freaking lipstick already and before I had even finished my sentence she was walking away. She seemed put out that this scheme didn't work and I returned the used beer. So nasty.   So the meal overall totally sucked and if I lived in Macedonia I would never eat here.  My kid still talks about Ohio two months after the trip, namely the grossness of this Chili's experience."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot. Well managed establishment( John Meredith is a fantastic operator!! ). Service is always attentive and friendly. Krista S might just be my favorite bartender in PV!! Really good beer selection and the new slimmed down menu is perfect!!"}
{"text":"My family had dinner at Chili's today. We had the BEST service from Desha, but unfortunately can't say the same thing about the food! I ordered the ribeye cooked medium, and a \"well done\" steak is what was served. Desha apologized and offered a new steak cooked to the requested temperature. The new steak be boxed to go, and once I got home and cut into the steak, it was  RAW. I called Chilies, spoke to a manager named Troy, he was VERY CONDESCENDING, RUDE AND INCONSIDERATE. We will be looking for another neighborhood restaurant. Applebees here we come!!!"}
{"text":"Location is good.  Surrounded by at least 6 hotels and an easy walk for guests Decor is the same as any other chili's.  Fairly busy the night I stopped in, bit it was after the dinner rush.  Server forgot to ask of I wanted a glass of water.  The salads are good.  Try the Caribbean salad.  First time for me and will definitely order it again. As I was eating, the server placed the check on the end of the table, as if that was a clue.  Did mot ask me of I wanted another drink or care for something else.  Service in  this franchises/ chain needs work.  Better service, better tips, increase revenue. Restaurant was clean and the food served promptly."}
{"text":"This place is jacked up. Then brunt the Salomon. My mom's big supper everything was cold. With loaded fries where cold.  Sons food was the only one right. This is my 3rd try at this place Because it's close to home.  Oh well 3rd time shame on me.  The people next to me food was messed up also.."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad, but anything pleasurable about my Chili's experience is usually cloaked by extremely slow service.  Their pizzas are yummy, but let's be honest-- you could go somewhere far better in the Arboretum."}
{"text":"Blame it on the World Series - but the Husband and I found ourselves frequenting our local Chili's a lot as of late.  I loved being able to pull up to the bar/counter and watch the baseball game on the main TV, despite it being Sunday or Monday night football.  (Even the casinos' sports books featured the football games over the Worlds Series!)  Sure, the other TVs showed football but the sound was on the baseball game.  (And this is a dream for the Husband!)   Another big plus is that this is a completely smoke free environment.  Yes, even though it's a state law that you can't smoke where food is served, many local bars still do it.  So I definitely appreciate that you cannot light up anywhere in this restaurant.  During football season, happy hour is in full swing which means discounted food and drinks.  I'm loving their Bottomless Tostada Chips (and the baby was loving it too at one point).  I used to love Chevy's version of chips and salsa, but I love Chili's version more.  Other appetizers we've tried were the Skillet Queso, which is a meat and cheese dip and best enjoyed when it's hot.  The Husband also had their Boneless Buffalo Wings with bleu cheese dressing.   One of their great deals would be the Bottomless Express Lunch.  It's AYCE soup, salad, and chips and salsa; and you can change your soup options so you're not stuck with just one kind.  The salad option is either a house salad or their Caesars salad.  Soup choices include Chicken and Green Chile Soup, Sweet Corn Soup, Chicken Enchilada Soup, and their Soup of the Day.  For 50 cents more, you can include their Terlingua Chili into the mix.  For $2 more, it becomes the Bottomless Express Dinner!  Sitting at the bar/counter - it's definitely a leisurely meal and the bartenders aren't rushing you, which is something we appreciate.  We can still grab a table in the bar area and get plenty of attention from the waitstaff, especially when you're getting refills on your salad and soup.  And talk about family-friendly, this place is the spot.  Every night we've been there, we've seen tons of families littered all over this place.  Huge tables and lots of high chairs readily available.  Looks like we'll continue being regulars now!"}
{"text":"Ladies night here before a movie! Just sat in the bar and had some appy's and a few margaritas! Food was good and came out quick the waitress was very attentive to all of our needs."}
{"text":"So last week was my first time to any Chili's restaurant and it just so happened to be in Vegas. I was a little worried because of the reviews but gave them the benefit of the doubt and chanced it.  Good service (became great after she received her big tip) and you can't go wrong with the food and prices. Husband and I took the 2 for $20 - choose an appetizer to share and an entree for each person. We thought because it was only $20 that portions were going to be smaller than if you were to purchase them separately but it wasn't the case at all. You can honestly get full on the appetizer. The Chili's near our home is always too crowded, week nights and all, because military personnel and their family go off base to have dinner there which is why we have never tried it before. We would definitely go back there again on our next vacation!"}
{"text":"This is going to be short.  Went here this past Sunday.....Everyone enjoyed their food.  Service was just ok.  The floor was dirty.  The menus had food on them.  They need to take time to clean them."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Lava cake & fruit tarts are frozen. Their To Go service is always inconsistent. They don't double-check your order before handing it to customers."}
{"text":"We haven't been here in a long time so it was due :). Sat down with no wait. Our waiter was friendly and swift. I didn't what I wanted so he took my son's ahead of time. He was hungry. He ordered crispy chicken strips with mandarin oranges. He loved it ( he ate so fast sorry no pics) and this was off the kids menu. I finally ordered a new pairing choice of two items- chicken enchilada and soft taco with black beans and rice. It was yummy. They have updated their menu and there is so much to choose from. My son enjoys the games on their mini kiosk."}
{"text":"this check in is for about 6 months ago. I went in with my family and I could tell right off the back that our server was #1 new, #2 overwhelmed & #3 had no eye contact (which tells me a lot about a person). He started off by not knowing menu. Then about the order. No checking on us when the ordering was taking forever. BUT.....when the food DID come there was no soup.....which I did say in the first place that we would like our soups 1st. The worst thing about it was that we didn't get our soups, at all. He told us the reason we didn't get them was because they were out of soups and then later, they were defrosting!!! 30 minutes later, after we get our food????????? I'm a server for over 25 years now. I started out in a mom and pop in Chicago and now YEARS later in banquets......So seriously his BS only pissed me off more!! I didn't even tried to hear it. I request ( from the hostess to get me) another server right away. A nice server came over and I told I was curious on the soups for the day and he said what they were and I asked how long it would take to get one if I ordered one at a table right now. He looked at me as the question was weird (which I get. it was odd) after telling him that I felt as though another server was giving me a lie about the soups, he told me that he would send over the manager to me. I was greeted by the manager at my table after about 5 minutes. He was extremely nice and I told him my concerns about the experience I was having with this server. He tried to back the server and his horrible excuses, but then after I added that he never came back to my table and told me that the soup wasn't available or defrosted and never got my fries at all, changed the managers responds. He then went to the kitchen and brought out each one of the soups.....then I was pissed more because then it was clear to me that the server was lying and the manager felt it was easier to back the server then tell the truth that he forgot or even had too many tables. The manager asked if I wanted any of the soups and tried to give the fries for free. I'm telling ya disappointment all over the place!!! I think they did give me some sort of discount but seriously I could give a care about the money, (which I did express to the manager) if about the service....lying about being backed up??? really??? anywho, not going back....cant even tell ya how far back this probably goes.....hiring, training, management, and so on and so on.  but for the cooks....two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good here. They are a chain place so like most but maybe slightly above the average. Food is decent although could be improved. One major complaint the last time we were there in the bar section in a booth, the bartender seemed to slam the empty bottles in the trash as hard as possible, so made us a little jumpy every time it was done. Bad when it's way louder than the music."}
{"text":"I'm just not a fan of Chili's. Arrived on a Sunday afternoon and the place was hoppin. Got a table for 3 in less than 10 minutes. The restaurant was very loud, crowded, and looked trashed. Service was very slow and the food came out even slower. Those are the cons.  On the bright side, our waitress was really friendly. The classic margatita was only $5.00 and was delicious. I got the shrimp tacos and found them to be really good considering I'm at a Chili's. The shrimp tacos were not spicy as advertised, but they were tasty. I wasn't expecting large, succulent shrimp and I was right, but still tasty. Again, this is taking the fact that I'm eating at Chili's so I have lower food expectations.  My mom got the raspberry margarita and found it to be too sweet. They also served it with a sugar coated rim instead of salt, they just shouldn't do that anymore.   My vegetarian husband ordered the smokehouse burger without the bacon with a black bean patty instead. The burger looked really tasty and moist. You are substitute any burger with a black bean patty if you are looking for a healthier option.  Ended our meal with a chocolate chip cookie a la mode. The cookie is served in a mini skillet and was cooked perfectly so it's warm and a little gooey. I don't like my cookies crunchy if being served with ice cream.   If I ever go back to Chili's, I wouldn't go on a Sunday afternoon. I would also order a classic margarita and the chocolate chip cookie dessert. If I were starving, I would get the shrimp tacos again."}
{"text":"Love everything on their lighter choice menu- I've literally tried every item. Hubby loves their burgers and chips and salsa. Also the presidente marg is the best! The only complaint is their tap water is really bad."}
{"text":"Ribs were excellent as was the quesadilla explosion salad-great salad dressings. I would stick with the original bnq sauce, the other 3 aren't that great. Excellent customer service!  I also recommend doing their points system, our meal tonight was free!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service.  Ado like very much their food. The menu is huge so much to choose from. I had a steak topped with avocado with dried tomato and salad and could not resist the cheese cake just yummy."}
{"text":"My daughter and two grandchildren and myself had dinner tonight. My daughter & my 10 yr old granddaughter had the baby back ribs. They were NOT baby back ribs. The meat was dry and tough. The server explained to us that they were baby back ribs, but bigger, therefore more meat. My daughter told her that the quantity was not as important as the quality. Why did they do away with the REAL baby back ribs?? I told our server & manager that we would find another restaurant with REAL baby back ribs. Too bad because my granddaughter & daughter loved them."}
{"text":"The restaurant is filthy, the bottomless chips and salsa are pointless when server doesn't come back. Food is subpar at best.  The way in which the servers \"clean\" is disgusting. The floor is filled with food swept under the booths. Cleaning with a napkin isn't his things come clean! Gross!"}
{"text":"I actually like the newer menu. The tex mex was the way for chills to go. The beef enchiladas are great! Of course the southwestern egg rolls are a must."}
{"text":"Came with a party of 20. Our food took forever to come out in fact mine and my children's food did not come out till after everyone was done eating. It took forever for refills as well. The staff was very apologetic about the orders getting mixed up. The place was clean bathroom and all. Although the food came late every dish was prepared correctly. In the end the whole meal for the whole party was comped."}
{"text":"I've previously reviewed a place in Barstow ca that served the worst coffee in the world.  But after stopping at this chilis for breakfast on my way out of town, I'm reconsidering who should have that honor.    I obtained calories and caffeine from my meal here.  That's really all I can say that's positive here.    I've been to my share of greasy spoons and airport holes in walls, so it's not like I had crazy expectations here. I love my greasy eggs and simple brewed coffee, but this was just unacceptable.   Food: bacon lukewarm and chewy.  Toast burnt on one side raw on the other.  Also cold.  Eggs under cooked.   Service: surly. 5 minutes after my food was delivered I asked for silverware and was sneered at.  Ditto for salt and hot sauce, which were eventually thrown on the table.    Coffee: out of this world bad.  Lukewarm brown dishwater approximates the flavor.    I really don't like given negative reviews, but please avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????  ????????1???????????????????????????  ????????????????????????  ??????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Horrible experience from the moment I walked in. The restaurant was slow yet the waitress took forever to take our order and lacked quality service. When the food came to the table my plate was dirty, full of debris and appeared very unappetizing. When we asked to bring the concerns to the managers attention the manager simply felt that replateing my food into another plate would solve the issue. When I did eat the food it was warm not hot and felt as though it had been microwaved. Lastly, the icing on the cake is the fact that I was charged $0.99 for table top entertainment without notice or consent. This was my second time there and will be my last. Do not go eat here, stay far away and cook at home because it will be 100x better."}
{"text":"When we sat down the section was so filthy, the host was very unpleasant & rude. The silverware was not polished & the food was not cooked to the right temperature... the plate was hot but the actual food was not. So disappointed I had to pay full price but I will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend, and found everything lacking. The food was ok, my Chicken Tacos were VERY soggy, and friends Quesadilla was just ok, no flavor.  Our server was running literally the whole time, which is odd because they just were not that busy. The little computer on the table to pay with was confusing, although it divided our check for us.  The only good thing was the Watermelon Lemonade. Oh Sweet Lord in Heaven, it had refills and I hit up every passerby for more till I felt my kidneys floating. Bathroom is very clean, and I could then fit more Watermelon Lemonade in. :D  All the staff seemed to pitch in, usually a plus, but having ten people grabbing things off the table started to feel more like being mugged than waited on.  I didn't try dessert, 10 lbs away from goal weight, but I did get a to go glass. Heh. Yup, Watermelon Lemonade to go. It's a seasonal item so hurry in when you want an air conditioned place to visit and something to drink."}
{"text":"This Chili's has always had good service but tonight it was great.  Four of us went to dinner around 5:30pm and waited about 5 minutes for a table.  As soon as we were seated our waiter, Sean, took our drink orders.  He was back in a few minutes and even had our beer.  He asked if we needed more time and we said yes.  When we had decided, he was there immediately.  He took our orders and was off.  We had order a flat bread with chipolte chicken as an appetizer.  Sean showed up with a basket of chips and salsa.  He said the kitchen was taking too long and for us to enjoy these, on the house, while we waited.  In a few mintues our appetizer was delivered.  When dinner arrived, Sean was there to make sure everyone was happy and got what they ordered.  He asked us several times if we needed anything without being bothersome.  He asked if one of us needed a drink refill instead of just delivering it.  I noticed that he was taking care of 6 four seat tables and 4 six person booths.  The food was hot and tasty from the ribs to the chicken to the shrimp.  The food was good but Sean's wait service made this a very enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Appetizer took 35 min to get.. How I know? I checked when I checked in on yelp cause my stomach was growling! The place was pretty busy on a Thursday night. I like that I don't really have to dressed or put on makeup to go here. The margaritas are delicious. Food.. So so. I ordered the dinner special for 2. 1 app, 2 entrees and 1 dessert for $35 bucks.  Not too bad. First time I've ordered a steak in a long time they I haven't eaten. They put butter all over it which made it very unhealthy for me. I don't think I would really est here again. Maybe just for some soup, salad, drinks and apps. The food just looked and tasted plasticky to me."}
{"text":"We came here right before our flight back home. We were seated fast and our server came fast as well. Our server was Brent and are so glad we had him as a server. He was very helpful with our order by providing us with suggestions. He was very kind, attentive and would go out of his way to make our dining experience pleasant. Brent is a great addition to your team! If I lived in Las Vegas I would request him every time I would eat there. Food was delicious and portions were rather larger than most Chilis I have been to. Will be back again when I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Overall I'm always pleased with this Chillis. I've never had any issues with cleanliness until my latest visit. It was pretty trashed. The floors looked like they haven't been swept all day. My feet were literally on trash and food the whole time.  I usually get to go orders so I don't spend a lot of time in the dining room. Maybe it was a bad night  The food is always great. My order was wrong this time but it was fixed right away - no problem.  My waiter seemed out of it as well. He brought me the wrong ticket and admitted it had been a long night.   Overall it was ok. Will I be back?   Of course.  -----------------------------------------------------  Service is terrible. I've held off on reviewing my last couple of visits. Original order was wrong again but I'm used to that. Took 20 minutes to get it corrected. No offer discount, no comp, no manager. In my last review I said I'd come back. I'm a loyal customer. I've hit duke here a couple of times on Yelp. I'm not coming back. I've had all I can take."}
{"text":"Chilis is always consistent in taste.  Very good for a restaurant that is a chain... Just tried the margarita flatbread today.  It was a light meal but delish!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you want Mexican, you got it.  If you want Asian, ditto.  If you want Italian, that's amore'.  I can't think of a better place to get a burger!  If you want to be healthier, they got that too!  P.S. the black bean burger is divine as well as da bomb!"}
{"text":"I have never really eaten at chili's, but I just moved to this area and figured why not give It a go.. So just to start off I came in and there were 2 hosts standing by the door. I asked for a table for 2 and they just looked at me like I was bothering them and then when they brought me to my table they just slammed the menus down and walked away. I was quickly greeted by a guy named Drew? I pretty much asked him to decide what I wanted to order since there was so many choices, I put a lot of faith into this man. He suggested the honey chipotle crispers, and oh my god am I glad he did. They were the perfect combination of sweet and spicy and the chicken itself was delicious. The manager made her way over and she was very sweet, her name was JC I think, I'm horrible with names. Over all my experience was decent and if I was to return I would make sure to return and sit with the same server Drew. He deserves my 20 % tip!!!"}
{"text":"Have come here a few times for dinner & happy hour. Always get great service & yummy food. Drinks are alway good too."}
{"text":"Well I love the triple play and the Chicken fingers here. But I know the quality and service is low but it is good for chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Chili's in a while. I usually love it, but this past Sunday my Mom and I went and it was bad! From the service to the food. All of it not good!  We started off with the bottomless chips and salsa. This was the only good thing about the experience. I also checked in on Foursquare and noticed I got a free bottomless chips and salsa with check-in I asked our waitress about it. She had no clue about it at all. She even said that she had never seen it before and had me read her off the coupon code. The chips were surprisingly light and very tasty and the salsa was pretty fresh.   For lunch I decided to have their new Bacon Avocado Chicken Sandwich. It came on a pretzel  bun, with tiny bits of sauteed onion, very none existent cilantro pesto mayo and fries. It looked really pretty and looked like it was going to be really yummy. Alas, I was wrong. So very tasteless! The whole thing just had no flavor and needed some serious sauce. I tasted none of the mayo at all. Even the fries tasted bad.   My Mom ordered the Southern Smokehouse Bacon Burger. Again, it looked really yummy and was huge, but was flavorless. She also said it was mushy in the middle and the ancho-chilie BBQ sauce was not on there at all!  When the sever brought us our food we asked for a couple of sides of ranch for our fries. She said no problem. I ate half of my sandwich and had given up on the ranch and was using ketchup before we finally got our ranch. Both of our fries were cold by the time it came and then it wasn't even our server that brought it to us!   Chili's you disappointed me. From your servers to your food: meh! I feel I totally wasted my money and time! I should have just gone to Rachel's Kitchen where I know the food has taste and is yummy!"}
{"text":"Friends don't let friends eat at (most) chain restaurants. I should have known better.  My boyfriend and I were super hungry, and we wanted to spend a little time out enjoying the evening. We had a $25 GC for Chili's and thought this to be a good time to use it. (Hey, being broke really sucks!) We walked in and were cheerfully greeted by the hostess. Once we were seated, we waited quite awhile for the server to come and take our drink order. By the time he arrived, we already knew what we wanted.   He seemed rushed and impatient. That made me feel anxious and embarrassed, and I don't like that feeling when I am going to eat....or basically ever. We went with the appetizer and two entrees for $20. We chose the onion strings and jalapenos. You can't go wrong with fried onions, right? Wrong. Super wrong. They were really salty and peppery, and it was hard to finish them. In fact, we didn't even get a chance. The waiter took the leftovers without even asking if we were finished!   A long long wait went between our appetizer and our entree. We ended up ordering the 5-cheese pizzas. They eventually arrived, and they looked good. They were lukewarm though, and we were missing ranch that we had asked for multiple times.   So we waited an eternity to get ranch. This pizza desperately needed the ranch to make it palatable. Seriously. It was that bad.   The server kept taking ages to come back and pay attention to our needs. I ordered a Blue Moon, and it took super long for that to come to the table too. I needed a drink after going through what we went through for this meal! Oh, but he didn't even ask to see my I.D. Some people might think that's cool, but I am extremely bothered when I.D. checking is not strongly enforced. I could have easily been an underage girl, in fact, a lot of people think I am! I thought this was extremely irresponsible and dangerous behavior, and it's not something I would expect from ANY establishment!   Other complaints include the fact that what is vegetarian and not vegetarian on their menu is rather ambiguous. Did you know that their seasoned tomatoes are seasoned with some kind of animal-protein based seasoning? What is that about? Gross.   I really dislike leaving bad reviews, but our experience here was just so awful. I felt bad for the server because he seemed like he was having a hard time, but everything kept getting worse, and it is extremely unacceptable.   I will not return to this Chili's, nor will I go to any other Chili's in the future."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with work. Some of us needed to leave so we ordered to go. Took forever!! And was not that good. Server wasn't very nice."}
{"text":"I secretly love Chili's.  There, I said it.  I'm not proud.  It's an obnoxious chain, but it's the obnoxious chain I default to when my friends want to go to a chain restaurant.  And okay, the Southwestern Eggrolls are delicious.  I've been to this location many times, and I've always gotten pretty good service.  This is a reliable stop if you're out on Prospect and need something quick and relatively inexpensive."}
{"text":"Lots of miss and one hit( food)! My tacos were very good but the service sucks badly! It took Shannon 10 min to noticed me when she was serving a table behind me. She probably passed by me 2 times before saying hi! I was at least expecting: I'll be right there with you when she saw me. I hate when I go to these places and ppl ignore me!! I ordered a bud light n took her over 10 min to deliver it to the table. Very slow service! I really don't understand why cuz I got there 930pm n the place wasn't that busy. With so many bad reviews I don't understand why these ppl don't get retrained?? That way the business can get better reviews. All the complaints are the same ( customer service) ! Teach these ppl how to say hi, bye and thank you!"}
{"text":"Ordered ahead of time for a Togo order, they said it would be ready for pick up in 10-15 minutes. Got here 20-25 minutes after calling and they hadn't even started putting our meal together. Super frustrating. But I always love chili's food, so I guess a 3 star will have to do."}
{"text":"I came by last night with a few friends, I was starving & really wanted a drink after a long day at work. The waitress took 15min to even acknowledge us & when she did this she only asked if we seated  ourselves or if someone sat us!?!? We then asked if they had drink specials she crossed her arms and said NO but if we moved to the bar booths we could get specials.. umm ok.. once we moved the other waitress told us the had no drink specials at that time that's when we realized the 1st waitress just did not want to wait on us. Good thing the 2nd lady was so so nice & checked up on us to make sure everything was ok."}
{"text":"On Las Vegas boulevard, a place for tourists at best. The food was so so, not that fresh and took forever to get our meal. The Ribeye was fat and had not taste. The salad was saggy and damped. On the good side, the service is always great and friendly. The Management should do a better quality control on the food preparation and freshness."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review for this location and add a star. It is a world of difference when you have the right people wait on you and managers who care. As I mentioned in my previous post, this place can be either awesome or they miss it by a lot. The most recent visit we had Shannon as our waitress. We were thrilled and had a great experience. We were also able to talk to Tiffany, a manager, and she was super apologetic about the previous experience. She told us that is not how that should have been handled. We are regulars at this Chilis and go in once or twice per week. I would highly recommend this location and either Shannon or Taylor as servers. I upped this place to five stars because of the experience we typically get here, and it is well deserved. One other note Chilis has a new rewards program that is fantastic, you earn rewards quickly and in the first month of being a member we have gotten a free entree, 2 free kids meals and an appetizer. We go more than most but it is definitely a great program."}
{"text":"It's delight, when chain restaurant decides to shift, and refine their value, and care for their clients experience.  It had been very long time since I had been to chilli's.   The new fresh menu, and server re-training, was well over due.  It was quite pleasing to not only get fresh tasty food, but also prompt and wonderful service.  Keep it up."}
{"text":"Was at the chilis for over 2 hours and nothing seemed to go as planned. Everything thing took 2 times longer than need. The wrong flat bread was brought out, and the French fries were never brought out. The food was cold and we were over charged for the fajitas. Been here before and it's always hit or miss, but this goes down as the worse experience. Nothing was comped which after that many mistakes you would think something would have been comped. Will never return."}
{"text":"THIS WILL BE LONG!!A friend and I visited this location after a long work night. We rushed to get there and was immediately sat upon walking in (This is the reason why one star was given). I love the presidential margaritas and I was craving them along with fajitas. We happen to see the advertisement for a 2 for $35 meal and it included the yummy margarita, appetizer, 2 entrees and desert as well AMAZING DEAL and my fajitas was on there I only had one question (whenever the server shows up). After only 8 minutes or so the server showed up she was super nice I believe her name was Boons at least that's what was on the receipt. So my question for her was how much extra would it be to have only shrimp fajitas (I only eat seafood and my friend is a veggie as well) Boons wasn't completely sure but she stated that she thought it was about $2 and that was fine for me. My friend was not sure what to get at this moment (it was her first time and possibly last time). I tell Boons go ahead and start our apps and for sure the margaritas and we will place the order my friend also requested a water. The time is now 10:12 we new they closed at 11 we just wanted to eat a little but mainly drink and take our food Togo. Soooooo we are sitting and sitting but we had some things to talk about but then I happened to look at my phone and notice that it was now about 1030 no drinks no apps no WATER!!!! I happened to glance to my left and notice how filthy the place was I mean there was literally trash EVERYWHERE DISGUSTING!!!! I tell my friend this place is a mess and I'm leaving in 5minutes!! I normally do not glance at other diners when I'm in. A restaurant but for some reason the trash in the floor had me starting to look everywhere and where the heck are my MARGARITAS?! Anyway there's Boons getting rubbed up and down by I'm assuming her boyfriend he was grabbing alllllllllll places on her and they are just kissing and having a full make out section. I happened to catch eye contact with him and I'm assuming he says something and she soon appeared with the margaritas and appetizer (CHEESE FRIES ARE AMAZING, no bacon of course lol) and apparently no side plates come with apps.We then place the rest of our order and I request that WATER AGAIN for my friend. It's now about 1040 no water but a lot of sex Ed well until she decided to finish out the other tables that were there. A group of 4 people came in after us received drinks food and service far better than we did!!! Suddenly a girl out of no where appears with the water I now want a water too since obviously I'm not going to get another 2 margaritas I pictured myself having. YES I SUCKED DOWN THAT MARGARITA QUICK hey I was in a mission.. Anyway another mako it section has now moved closer to us because as Boons begins to work on the computer her love shows up behind her and they go at it again!!!!!!!!!! Now I'm furious and ready to go I begin mumbling loudly about the I professionalism that is not happening! Soon the session breaks up and out comes the food!! Yay it's only 1050 now. Boons places the meal down I have a fajita and tortillas not the side of beans and rice I requested not the two sides of avocado we ordered; she then states that she will be right back with those items at that time I request a plate so that I can eat my fajitas on it instead of off the skillet as well as a water she returns with everything but the side plate! I then nibble a little because im upset and annoyed by the dirty staff and restaurant. My friend finishes her meal !!Boons has not checked on us at all!! Eventually she pops up I'm like can we put that desert order in please and get a couple boxes! She brings the boxes the desert was shortly after and then I asked for togos for the desert as well. My friend runs to the bathroom when the check was presented once she returns we pay and was out of there. The restaurant was now completely empty chairs were pushed to the door the parking lot was dark and empty!  The service SUCKED BUT THE FOOD WAS GREAT AS USUAL!! Where the heck was the managers???????????? Won't be back for a looooong time!!!"}
{"text":"You really try to be positive and optimistic in your reviews , eager to just leave bursting words of excitement but Chili's kicked all that hope and optimism out of you .  The service here will always be subpar, wait just plain old HORRIBLE.    I can't waste money on dysfunctional attitudes anymore . My last visit to this location and probably any Chili's chain ever again . Not like they care , right ."}
{"text":"I haven't had a reason to use my Yelp account until Saturday night. This most recent experience at Chili's is one that has caused me to not want to dine at a Chili's for a long time.   Here's the story. We arrived at 6:30 and were told that the wait would be approximately 20 minutes. After 30 minutes passed, we went inside and asked the hostess how much longer it would be, and she said it would be around 15 more minutes, but she shouldn't verify it. She mentioned that most of the larger parties were taking, \"Longer than we expected.\". So we continued to wait. After 45 minutes passed, we went inside and asked for water, since there was no space to sit or stand with a party of 5, which we had. During this time, I should also mention that we noticed two different parties that arrived after us be seated, eat, and leave before we even got seated. They were smaller parties of course, but I still do not validate that as an excuse. Finally after 1 hour and 6 minutes we were seated.   If there was one highlight of our meal, it was our waitress; unfortunately they were wearing avocado-desgined shirts that night, and none of us remembered hearing her name. It would've been nice to mention the best aspect of our night, if only we received her name. Regardless, we received 3 orders of chips for free, as per the request of the manager (Robert). At this time Robert explained to us that he did not expect this amount of traffic tonight, and that he was deeply sorry for our wait. He also told us that he would offer us a free desert from our troubles.  When we got the food, it was also not up to the standards that I had expected from Chili's over the years; I should mention that we waited an additional 45 minutes to receive our food. Our french fries on the Old-timer Burger were cold, and the Enchilada that we received was not up to standards. It was disappointing to say the least. At this point, we wanted to ask if we could at least have our deserts comped, since the night was already 2 hours and 45 minutes long. Even our waitress told us that, \"We only usually comp one desert, but I can check with my manager to see what we can do.\" Our 3 deserts were comped, but having resistance to ask for a comped desert, not a meal, was the, \"Icing on the Cake\" if you will. We did not end up finishing our desert and leaving Chilis until 9:40 that night.  This experience was so distasteful, and it is unfortunate too from our perspective of Chili's; our family greatly enjoys going to Chili's, and for one of us is their favorite restaurant to dine at. This experience has soured even her, and she does not want to return to a Chili's for a long time, if ever again after our wait and overall service. One of us believed that the entire meal should've been comped, due to our entire 3 hour experience. As for myself, I have no desire to return to this particular Chili's, and if I do even return to one, it will be in a very long time. I will forever have a distrust of Chili's wait times and service after this experience. Overall, very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"The food is is wonderful, hot and fast and the staff gave us the most impeccable service I've ever had at a restaurant. 10/10 experience and the best Chili's I've gone to"}
{"text":"The place was dirty when we came in on a Sunday evening at 6 pm. They weren't busy and had lazy enough staff to not recover. Our waitress had some sort of psychological problem where she talked to herself, wiped an over flowing beverage on her pant leg and allowed bland Luke warm food out of the kitchen. She didn't know how to service our one year old who was with us.   Even another tabled complained about the food, the bathroom and the waitress.  This location has really slacked off since the last few times I've pardoned this establishment in the last few years. I'm done visiting this location.     One star for effort.  Another star for your past greatness."}
{"text":"Worst location I have ever been to. The service was so bad that I should've gotten McDonald's. The waiter had an attitude and was so rude to everyone..... Why work there if you hate your job as a server!? My turkey burger was so hard that when you banged a knife on it it was soooo loud like knocking against cardboard.;  The chicken wings were cold, and whenever I asked the waiter to fill my water he would be like \"uh what do you want\" WTF IS WRONG WITH THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Horrible  service.      Understaffed to save money.     Plan on a long wait, during even with the restaurant half empty"}
{"text":"Service was average on a Saturday Night Football.  Not much activity here on this past Christmas weekend. The bartender kept leaving the bar to serve tables so it took me a few extra minutes to order another drink @ the bar. The bartender was really nice and helpful.  I've never seen this before at a bar but they had this strip of ice running across the bar where you can set your cup to chill on. That blew my mind!  See you guys next time on the next episode!"}
{"text":"this place is ridiculous. my family of 5 waited for 10minutes before we even saw a hostess to ask us 'how many?' then said there was (of course!) a wait.  we were the only people waiting to be seated and there were numerous tables open in all their areas. they had an hour before closing.   there was a male server that had the nerve to tell me there was a 30 minute wait, probably so we can just leave.  he wasn't very friendly either.   FYI, we left. there was another party that came in after us that left due to the BS wait just for a hostess. never will come here again.  please manager, teach your servers etiquette."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I would give zero stars if possible!!! Worst service EVER!! First customers in the door at 11am and waited over an hour for our food and ended up just taking it home!! I couldn't even eat my chicken sandwich because it was so disgusting!! The manager did refund my lunch with out me asking which was nice but needless to say I will not be back!!"}
{"text":"So I ordered this shitty ass Big mouth bites, and instead of getting four shitty ass individual hamburgers I got 1 hamburger cut up into 4 shitty ass quarter pieces, not to mention I threw up after I got done eating my shitty ass food. The only good part about this shitty ass Chili's was the waitress. Will I ever eat at this Chili's again? No, would I recommend this Chili's? Hell to the fucking NO. This is a god awful Chili's."}
{"text":"This is the worst Chili's I've ever been to.  When we arrived, it was before 6:00PM and we were seated right away because there were about 1/2 dozen tables seated in the dining room.  Our server came over and took our drink order and we also ordered an appetizer of the Skillet Queso.  She brought our drinks and asked if we were ready to order.  It was a new menu and we had an appetizer coming, so I wasn't in a hurry.  She checked on us a couple of times and we were finally ready after about 10 minutes.  We placed our dinner orders and waited.  Other tables were being seated and our server was busy.  After another 10 minutes our server was still busy delivering drinks and chips to other tables and then she disappeared.  I called over to our table a young man who had been walking around with a television remote and asked if he could check on our Queso.  He disappeared and after about 5 more minutes, our server came back with drink refills.  I asked her if she would cancel our appetizer because our meals should be coming out very soon.  She said OK and went into the back.  Then the young man came out with a skillet that was half full of Queso and we informed him that because it took so long, we had cancelled it.  He apologized and took it back to the kitchen.  20 minutes later, our meals arrived.  My meal was warm, my wife's was OK and my sons was blistering hot.  The server checked on us and I asked why everything had taken so long.  She said that she didn't know and offered to have the manager come to the table.  I said that would be nice.  The same \"young man\" who had been walking around with the television remote (and ignoring customers) came to our table.  He said that he is \"one of the managers\" and that he is new to this location.  While we were waiting, I had looked up the Yelp! reviews on this location.  I asked him if he had seen them and he said that he did not.  I told him how I had received bad service 8 months ago and it took me this long to come back.  I told him that based on my previous visit and this one, we would never come back.  He apologized but did not offer any explanation on why it took so long (to maybe let us know that our experience was unusual) or any invitation to try again.  I didn't want or expect anything for free, just an attempt to get us to try them again.  An offer to come back, ask for him and he would make sure that we had a good experience would have been enough to get us to come back.  Nope.  He was complacent to accept our complaint and move on.  I'm sure that there was something on TV that we were taking him away from."}
{"text":"AMBIANCE: 3 - It's a Chili's. It looks like a Chili's. You know, I never expect anything from these types of places, but they look average! Then again, the McDonald's \"breakfast nook lounge\" as I like to call it, looks fancier.   SERVICE: 4 - I thought the service was really good. Our waitress was sweet and kind. She had a lot of personality and was really friendly!   FOOD: 2 - I'll be honest, we only came here because we had a gift card. But that doesn't change the fact that the food was just okay. I've definitely had better burgers. The one thing that the strangest was that I asked for my burger to be cooked medium, and it was cooked medium well. Now, I'm not mad and I never get mad at these types of tiny things, but I've actually never had that happen to me before!"}
{"text":"I have been consistently let down by Chilis, and I continue to give them second chances.. But probably not anymore. My husband and I ordered pick up- and I paid 1.00 extra for onion rings with my meal. I received 3 1/2 onions (and that is being generous). Everytime we order take out from Chilis, we want it to be as good as when you go into the restaurant but it continuously lets us down. After spending 25 dollars on two meals, and only receiving the bare minimum food (some we paid extra to get), this is only getting 2 stars. Please don't go here, or don't order take out- it's a waste of money.   ***im currently updating my review and dropping it to one star simply because the restaurant had the decency to reply to my comment. The problem with this is that the BS link given doesn't even work/exist.. No help there- thanks but no thanks. Don't go here... Terrible"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Fast service! Conveniently close to my home. Take out service is quick and always hot! Servers are very friendly. Very clean restaurant. Restrooms clean. Hostess seat you quickly. Drinks always at table quick. I love the margarita chicken the best! A+"}
{"text":"I'm sad. Ordered our food to go. No sauces provided, the kids chicken strips toast like breaded chicken jerky - inedible, not safe to give a kid - unable to chew and not choke. Missing French fries and they only provided two tortillas for our fajitas. No lettuce for our fajitas. Big bummer."}
{"text":"Went with my.family Friday night. Our drinks were wrong, she forgot our waters, side of ranch, didnt check on us. My sisters steak was way over coockrd but by the time the waitress returned it, we were all ready to leave. Its obvious our food was sitting in the window for some time.  I dont expect a great meal at this place. I only expect OK but this experience was simply terrible."}
{"text":"Food was good. Unfortunately the kitchen sent out a bacon cheese burger when we'd ordered the BBQ smokehouse burger. The floors were sticky.  Like someone used dirty water to mop the floors rather than use clean water with cleaner in it.  The front desk person was nowhere to be seen for almost two minutes.   When she did show up she acted like she was on drugs.  No going here again."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review. My wife and I went there tonight (excited for some Chili's).  Boy were we surprised when we got there. We waited for a table which seemed odd, but when we overheard that they ran out of silverware, we understood. As we were being seated, the hostess and a waitress argued about who was going to sit us because we didn't look like good tippers. We were sat in the back, by the cold door, and away from everyone. Ten min after sitting there, the waiter came to the table to tell us that the fryer is down and that it's so bad there that we should leave. Got it buddy...we left. Horrible experience and the staff should be ashamed of themselves. You don't treat customers like that. Don't ever go to this Chili's."}
{"text":"This is only based on the restaurant's location and hours. The location is not very good (unless you go to the college it is located at perhaps). I went here thinking it would be a regular Chili's but it is in fact a special campus location with unusual hours. It was annoying to get to and park, and the place was closed anyway. Beware the different hours in summer! It's not open during normal meal times and the hours here and on their website don't reflect the summer hours so it is probably a good idea to confirm that it's open before wasting your time (and money on parking) going down there."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Chili's restaurants many times all over the country, and this is the worst experience I have had. The food just wasn't very good, the service was mediocre, and the atmosphere was not pleasant. They didn't even get the molten lava cake right, which has never happened to me before. The cake was seriously overcooked and it really just ruined it (this is especially sad since the molten is what I look forward to most at Chili's)."}
{"text":"Ate here for our anniversary (5/13/2014).  Ordered: 2 for $35 Chips and guacamole 2 Mango margaritas 10/10 Original iron steak 9/10, could have been a little bloodier Pork/ch fajitas 10/10 The chocolate cake with icecream. 10/10  I believe Ashlee was our waitress, if not sorry. She was great. The margarita recommendation was awesome. The guacamole was fresh, and the chips just fried. Splitting the pork and chicken for my wives fajita was her suggestion. (she couldn't make her mind up). The steak was flavored just right.   The new touch system tablet at the table is a great convenience. You can reorder, play unlimited games for a $1, get drinks and dessert, and close out your bill on it.  Ambience is great and the restaurant side, clean. On the bar side, has TVs with sports for a cool hang out.   We had no wait time, table tops were clean. Saw hardly any waiting times at the door or for food. We will be back to sit at the bar and try some of thier other drink specials."}
{"text":"I did an  online order for it to go order. I gave them a few extra minutes since it was a weekend. The pick up time is at 2:15 and the directions were to text the words I'm here when I arrive. I did everything I was supposed to do, pre-paid for my order including a tip. I still had to wait 10 minutes in the parking lot for my food to be brought out to my car. My food was lukewarm at best. I went inside and asked for the tip to be refunded to my credit card. The manager print me a receipt saying he reversed the entire order but did not reverse it for the full amount. He left out the tip. When I questioned this he offered me a half baked explanation and \"promised\" me it would come off my card correctly. I now have $40 tied up with this restaurant while I wait to see what happens tomorrow. For one order. I know what WILL happen tomorrow. I will be on the phone with my bank making sure that I get the entire amount of my purchase refunded correctly. And from now on I will go across the street to Friday's restaurant for my to go orders."}
{"text":"I typically do not eat at chain restaurants because id rather support a local business but my friend wanted to eat here after doing some shopping. We planned on visiting the mall close to this location as well upon finishing our meal here and this was a better option then some of the fast food restaurants located in this strip mall. We were seated a bit later than expected. A few tables were needed to be cleaned before being able to be sat and it was actually quite busy here. Our server was pleasant and our food came out in a timely manner. My friends sister had ordered mango tea and it was lacking in flavor and also very watered down. The server brought more mango server but was still lacking tea flavor like it was brewed weak. We started with spinach and artichoke dip as an app before deciding on the 2 for $22 which seemed like a good option but the appetizer they give you is quite small. I'm not sure if it's served that small normally. Had we known we would ordered the 2 for $22 we wouldn't have orders the artichoke dip. It was too much food. I had fajitas and she orders the Cajun pasta that comes with chicken and added shrimp. The server explained it was a .50 charge to add the shrimp. When we got the bill it was a $2.50 charge. That's fine but she didn't explain correctly. The garlic bread that came with the pasta was hard as a rock and my fajitas were served mainly with bell peppers and onions. The meat to veggie ratio was very off IMO. A reason why a don't typically enjoy coming to chain restaurants. I probably won't be coming back not because the food or service is terrible I just would rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Thank you, Chili's Tyvola!   I was traveling and starving.  I refused to stop at the exit with all the restaurants, hours before and I found myself starving a while outside of Charlotte. I knew I'd be staying at a Tyvola hotel, and the yelp app showed me that I was close to a Chili's.  They took my order- moments before closing- and thanks to the staff here, I got to have dinner.   The food was exactly what you'd expect- which was good- but they get some extra stars for being so accommodating. Thanks again, if it weren't for you, I'd have had Slim Jims and Lay's for dinner."}
{"text":"We got here with a party of five we were told we were only going to wait only 15 minutes for us to be seated it's taking 45 minutes and then the girl says that she doesn't know what time it's going to wait to sitdown my family it's the worst service I have ever had! I do not recommend this Chili's to anybody in the Chandler area it's best to drive to another restaurant or just go across street to the keg steakhouse"}
{"text":"This review is for the YYC Chili's in Concourse D, the open pub with some booth seating.  I do like the atmosphere because it's always buzzing with people and it also makes for great passersby and TV watching.    My issue this past weekend was the service.  I sat at the bar for at least five minutes before I was acknowledged.  I ordered a beverage as I didn't have enough time to eat.  I was asked if a can was okay and I requested a frosted glass, which is what they serve other beverages in.  I was a little disappointed that she put the can and glass in front of me to deal with it.  It's not that I'm too good to help myself, but I thought the service would be a bit better than that.  Upon paying, the server tipped herself with my cash and then didn't talk to me again.  Alllllrighty then.  Being that I saw other customers receiving better service, I wondered if my server had an issue with me or just wasn't loving her job that day.    This won't stop me from going back because I've not had a notably poor experience before.  Maybe I shouldn't sit at the bar?"}
{"text":"I don't often give a one star rating...but based on my experiences, this place deserves it.  I've been here multiple times and the food has always been poor quality.  This last time, I tried to give it one more shot and, let's just say, I should've known better.  Firstly, the food was awful. I really hate to complain, but I was given grilled chicken that a) looked and tasted as if it had been microwaved, and b) was cold.  I sent the chicken back and when the new plate was brought it was better, however it was almost 45 minutes later and my family had finished eating.  Additionally, my daughters chicken strips were just as bad.  Needless to say, we did not finish our food and for a 3 person meal (2 adults and one kids meal) payed almost $50.  I can think of 1000 different places that I'd rather spend the money, and will do so in the future.    In summary, Chile's is way overpriced and the food is appalling.  Go to McDonald's for a better meal."}
{"text":"The food here is almost always good but I wish I could say the same about the service. Because of the bad service, we have skipped going there many times. We got tired of having to call & talk to the manager about our poor service.  Also, I love their blackberry tea but it is very inconsistent. Sometimes it is sweet while bitter others.  So, I'd give the food 4-5 stars but 1-2 for service.  8/7/15-update. Family ate here about 4:30 pm. Not very busy yet took a while for food to show up. 3 of the meals we ordered were \"Mexican\" dishes & seemed way spicier than normal. Waitress seemed as if she had better places to be.   Usually enjoy the food but as dirty as the restaurant is, not sure we'll be returning anytime soon. Dirty floors, window sills, and tables. Here's a picture of the \"crack\" between our tables. Gross."}
{"text":"The staff is so nice and attentive, the food is beyond delicious and doesn't take forever to come out, everything is clean, and the prices are nice. Definitely my go-to for a casual/spontaneous date. Absolutely recommended"}
{"text":"The watermelon margarita was very good! Just saying, Lol ... Had dinner here to celebrate my grandsons birthday. First time at this location. Quite busy during the dinner hours as expected. Food and service was good and food was brought out fast and hot like i like it ..."}
{"text":"This place is sloooooowwww as molasses!!!! So i looked at yelp and guess what? Everyone thought the same thing. I wonder why."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the service provided by our waitress was awesome. the food was overpriced for what we got. salad and hamburger cost us over 30$. sadly it's not a place i think i will come back to. service in the kitchen was slow as well."}
{"text":"So I ordered curbside pick up at 12 o'clock today I went to the place and my order is set for 3 o'clock I  checked in at 2:50  a Gentlemen Walks out and tells me oh we're going to Bag it now So I wait and I wait and I wait at the 20 minute passes I'm like what is going on so I walk inside and the manager gives me a mean look she said did your order online did you check in I said yeah I showed her the app she walks to the back and finds my food and she says I didn't know you don't check in I said I definitely check in because I was greeted outside so i told her the employee name from his chilies tag she calls me a lair I'm like what and she holds my food hostage because it's my fault I rushed them for the food I'm wow rushed? I placed my order at 12??? How am I rushing you she folds her arms and shooed me out what a dirty manager what a dirty place the food was ok oh btw i was the only one in the parking lot and on the app it has a check in function and you have to put in your car model and color so you can't tell me I don't know because I'm the only one in the lot and in the curbside pickup lane"}
{"text":"The service is always good, and normally the food is by all means good, but not great.  However, I ordered the queso dip and it couldn't have been any more undesirable.  It seemed to be more bean dip than queso."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go food is amazing and drinks are even better. Went here to grab a quick bite and the environment was so good ending up staying for hours. Will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"Always a great place for a quick bite! Service at this location is always amazing, but Jenae is the absolute best! Plenty of healthy options available,  or plenty of ways to indulge!"}
{"text":"I really really like Chili's. I think they have some amazing food! With that being said, it took about 10 minutes for the server to acknowledge our presence. When he finally talked to us it seemed like he had no interest in actually talking us. It felt a little awkward being there. When we got our round of drinks, it didn't taste that great. I was willing to pay for it but he offered to get me a different drink. When the bill was presented, it showed a charge for the drinks. I didn't bother telling him he forgot because he didn't pay much attention to us in the first place. I'm willing to give this place another go, with hopefully a better experience."}
{"text":"Horrible. Last week placed a togo order and had to wait 20 minutes after my pickup time. Thought I'd give another chance, order on time but the chicken on my sandwich was only half on each bun.  I will never go back. Chipotle right next store is always spot on and the money worth it."}
{"text":"I love this chili's! My husband and I had several wonderful experiences here, staff is super friendly, and their steak is amazing! We love their points system where you can earn a free appetizer or a meal. It's crazy busy at times, and other times it isnt, just depends. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"After a long day of flying I decided to get Chilis To Go. HUGE MISTAKE. It started with them not being able to find my order because they had my name wrong & it went downhill from there. When I got home I found my soup was not in the bag. I opened the box for my entree & the pictures listed was what I found. Never again. Very expensive & the food is terrible."}
{"text":"Tried the new Chilis on University today, place was clean and looks great and the servers were friendly and smiled but I ordered a skillet queso as an appetizer and it was absolutely inedible, tasted like somebody dumped a whole shaker of salt in it. Told the server that it was horrible but got charged for it anyway."}
{"text":"Our server was very nice, had a great sense of humor.  That is the 2 stars for tonight.  Went in to satisfy my Fajita craving, Chili's has always had the best Fajitas ever.  Not anymore.  What is a pickled jalapeño ? Is there anything wrong with sour cream that it needs Cumin added?  I was so disappointed & worse than that, as a previous reviewer mentioned, the water tasted moldy!  Both of us went home feeling hungry."}
{"text":"We went later in the evening so we were seated pretty fast. Had the queso dip and salads. Food was good but service was really slow."}
{"text":"We always end up at Chili's when we can't think of anywhere else to go.  It's just that kind of place.  This location is just okay.  Sometimes the service is decent, other times it's slow.    For a while, Chili's had veggie tacos.  Man, I loved those things.  Now they are gone, and I am sad.    Still, I like their spicy sausage soup (whatever its real name is) and their black beans.  I'm sure we'll be back the next time we can't think of anything else to eat."}
{"text":"Chili's....it is what it is, and my review reflects this....  We typically come here at least 3 or 4 times a year, at least one time being for a birthday party and ribs.  They have ALWAYS treated us well, the food is decent, service is friendly, the the Chili's experience is perfect for a fun, bit loud, and silly birthday party.  The staff are fun, and oh-so-patient.  Hint...free brownie-ice cream treat on birthdays and with movie ticket stubs.  DANGER...sweet but, hard to resist.  The other times we're here it's for lunch during errands.  We usually sit at a hi-top in the bar to avoid the wait.  The waits can be long during peak periods but, they handle them well.  It's a fun place to watch games, good visibility of televisions in the bar and they're really nice about switching channels.  I've always had decent service here, too.  The food...the food is Chili's.  It's not fine dining, and not meant to be.  It's a hell of a lot better than Perkins or Red Robin.  They do a nice Tex-Mex/American blend menu, with a lot of good healthy choice options.  They're also not afraid to do tangy, hot, and flavorful.  If you can't find something you like on the huge menu, you're just too darn picky and don't go out to eat with me.  My only complaint is the place can be dirty.  To be fair, that's a bit inevitable with such a popular and busy location.  The staff do run around cleaning and are attentive but, on more than one occasion, I've had a dirty booth or table.  So, for that, 4 of 5 stars.  I'd give them 4.5 if it was an option."}
{"text":"I went to eat today with my husband and we sat in the bar area. Cassi was our server. She was outstanding, Very on top of things, and kept our table clean throughout the meal. She is a great server and has a great personality. She takes time to talk to each guest, yet stays on top of things. She also  makes us feel very welcome and remembered who we where from the last time we came. . We have gone to eat at this location  several time and usually eat in the restaurant area. But since the past 2 times we have decided to eat in the bar, and Cassi has waited on us both times. Now she will become our regular server. :)  Thank you for making our vist on to remember.  Oh and the food was outstanding, hot, fresh, and very fast for a 3 day weekend."}
{"text":"We go to this location often. However,  the last 2 times we've done carry out.  First carry experience wasn't great.  We barely got any food and my husband had to request them to give us more. It was about the size of a child's happy meal.  We thought okay maybe they're just really busy because when we dine in for service our portions are great. Nope. We were wrong.  We tried carry out a second time and the exact same thing happened. First the gentlemen told us it would be a 20 minute wait. That 20 minute wait turned into a 45 minute wait.  Secondly I ordered my normal chicken crispers on the 2 for $20 deal.  Both sides I asked for fries and I kid you not they gave me 7 fries total. FOR BOTH SIDES. My husband again had to request the cook to give us NORMAL portions. I honestly rather would have gone to the McDonald's next to it. At least I'm guaranteed to get a good size portion and I'm not waiting 45 minutes for chicken and French fries. Really really disappointed in the customer service here."}
{"text":"Who charges over $8 for a margarita and only puts in 1.25 ounces of tequila???? CHILI'S!!!!!!!!!  I ask the bartender because the last time we came I did their table survey and mentioned how weak their drinks were. So tonight before I ordered tonight I ask.  Guess I will be drinking water tonight!"}
{"text":"Worst chillis ever. Went with my 8 friends. No one liked this chillis. Poor service. Poor burger and bad drinks"}
{"text":"....where do I start?...well first off it was super busy...and I think that's when you can really tell the quality of an establishment! ....now for my complaints...my side salad came on a dirty plate...there was cork in the wine...the chicken...quesadillas and fries were cold...there were also two extra items on our bill...as we where finishing management was asking servers \"who wants to leave?\" ...I'm assuming because it was slowing down...but what he should have be doing is walking the floor asking how the food and service was...but clearly his priorities are not in order!!"}
{"text":"I love their thin tortilla chips & salsa & ordered their ribs and they were actually pretty good...it had been a while since I had last ordered them but they are actually better than I remember...we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Called in for a \"pick up\" order.   The girl answered and I ordered a: Guaqamole Burger with a Black Bean Patty (I don't eat meat) and NO Cheese or Sour Cream, but to ADD Tomato (this is important).  I get there and I pay, When I get the food I open the box to take a quick peak to make sure I didn't get some sort of Bacon Cheeseburger by mistake or something.   When I do this the girl makes a comment and said \"are you making sure I got the order correct or something?\".   I get all the way home and when I go to dive in to the burger I notice there's NO tomato. So I call back to let the girl know and she IMMIDIATELY went in to \"defense mode\".   She says \"well I specifically asked them to put it on myself so it's on there\" and when I assured her there was NOT any tomato because I was LOOKING at the burger she says   \"well if you want to drive all the way back I guess I can give you an extra slice of tomato? I mean what do you want me to do?\"  She then asked me if I wanted to speak with a manager, I said yes.  Put me on hold and finally the manager came on the line and when I explained to him the situation and what the girl said on the phone he says:  \"well that's unacceptable, thanks for calling in have a nice night\"  No resolve, No apology just quick to brush the issue aside. Forget about the tomatoes at this point it's the fact that My mother chose to get me a gift card to this specific establishment only for her money to go towards an experience like this.  I will never go back to this location because clearly not only do they make the mistake, and they DON'T make it right, you get attacked when you try to bring it to their attention.   If the skinny red head with the pixie cut is your server, just walk right back out the door and find somewhere else to eat because you will be in for a bad experience."}
{"text":"Came here for valentines day dinner with a friend. The wait time for a table was not long. But our waiter took forever to take our order. He passed out table about 9 times but never took our order. When the food finally did come my friends order was completely wrong. We complained and they offered to fix it but we were on a time restraint. I got the Parmesan crusted fish which was good but not great. I felt like the fish needed a little more crust. It just had crust on one side of the fish and chipotle sauce on one side also. It was plain. The rice was good and so was the broccoli. Overall it was an okay experience. My friend was really frustrated since she was really hungry.  Might come back"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Chili's in over 15 years.  I consider it a step above Denny's.  My teenage son had recently gone with another family a few weeks prior.  We had a special occasion and let him pick the restaurant.    He picked Chili's.  It's been a really long time, I'll go with his choice.  We sat down at 6:45.  We ordered.  We watched other people come in after and get their food.  We asked the waitress and she said something about it is on the ticket and should be out.  7:25 food came.  40 minutes on a Wednesday night.  For my first visit in 15 years, nothing is changing my opinion.  I had the smokehouse burger.  Flavorful?  Burnt.  What did it taste like?  A burnt burger.    My young son got mac and cheese.  It is just blue box Kraft.  I hope this didn't take them 40 minutes.  My son who picked the restaurant wanted the same thing he had last time.  Some chicken strips called crispers.  He thought they were much more spicy than before.  So much, he didn't eat them.    My wife had a small steak.  Eh.    Nothing went well.  It was really 1 star, I just feel sorry for them.   Also get those darn video game consoles off the table.  I need my kids to focus on eating not asking about video games.  I cannot recommend this place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my tacos came out cold as ice (literally). The plate was extremely hot.   Not sure if they microwave their food?  I took one bite, returned them and left."}
{"text":"Super busy on a Saturday night our server was slammed. Ordered 2 margaritas and an order of queso with chips for an appetizer. The queso was terrible because the menu described it as cheese with seasoned beef. Quite frankly the queso was an overly salty bean dip that looked like congealed beef gravy. Blech! To our server's credit he made it right and swapped out a spinach artichoke dip for us.  I had the Memphis dry rub ribs which were really good and nicely seasoned with a peppery, brown sugar and paprika mix. They were served hot and the sauce had a nice tang to it. My husband had the mixed fajitas with chicken and shrimp. It was pretty darn good as well with our daughter getting a cheeseburger, mandarin oranges and a chocolate milk.  I don't like the new table top screens that you can pay your bill with. It looks like a tablet with a stand. Not a problem unless you have a savvy preschooler that attempts to order dessert and another round of margaritas. Yeah, not so great on that point. The tablet ended up pushed to the far side of the table.  Our server was great in getting us napkins and removing the hideous bean dip. He did explain that Chili's was going to some pains due to getting rid of their bussers and expeditors which means the server has to do it all and it really detracts from service overall. Overall our experience was a 3, 3 1/2 star rating due to the service and the ribs pulling the numbers higher but Chili's needs to yank their 'queso' that is truly a bean dip and nothing more."}
{"text":"My husband took there today for a early Mother's Day lunch. Wen got the $10.99 specail, and it was great!!! We got a half slab ribs, fries, salad and a house salad, and molten cake, and I was very happy with this. Great Early Mother's Day meal"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar, and our experience didn't exactly start off well. My menu was very sticky, and there was trash and leftover food all around the bar from previous diners. I asked for a drink menu, and I was told I had to use the tablet. I told the bartender that I would prefer not to use it, because everything looked dirty. He rolled his eyes at me and huffed and puffed as he started cleaning the bar area. So I waited 10 minutes until he came back to again take our drink order. I ordered and the bartender insulted my selection. I was tempted to leave then and there, but we stayed. The food was good, and the portions are decent. Prices are adorable. The only thing that would keep me from going back was the lack of cleanliness. I would always recommend Chili's to anyone, because I love their food menu! However, this one I would pass on."}
{"text":"Awful experience here tonight.  Long wait for mediocre food at best.  The tea tasted like dishwater.  I've been to other Chili's locations and had excellent service and food.  My husband ordered ribs which are an up charge and was given 4 ribs.  My fajitas were burnt and bland.  The manager couldn't even be bothered to come over to our table when we asked multiple times for him to do so.  Save your money and eat elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Good food and service.  If Terry or Des is on - you are in luck."}
{"text":"Had party of 9 today, great lunch experience! We can pick any restaurant to have our Sunday meal at, but it all comes down to the SERVICE. Our waitress, Alix (and all her helpers!) were ON POINT! Our food was brought out hot, our cups were never empty, our used plates were cleared quickly & even the Manager (didn't get his name) came over a few times to check in on us. The Manager even took the time to thank us, in a sincere manner, for choosing their place to spend time at! So nice!! We will return to this Chili's again! Kudos guys, great customer service for sure!!"}
{"text":"A lot of people tend to stay away from chain style restaurants but we are on the other hand try to embrace them when we see or hear they have menu changes... or when trying new things with the kiddos is a failed attempt late on a Saturday night!!!   We were mainly drawn because of the EL Presidente Margaritas and the kids desire for corndogs. After I put down a few margaritas I decided to try their new smokehouse menu similar to a barbecue style menu. Ended up getting 2 meat combo (ribs and the chicken tenders) along with Texas toast, French fries and New roasted street corn.  Unfortunately we had a longer than expected wait for our food due to the busy environment. The part I liked is that the manager came to us without us asking and let us know that our food was slightly behind schedule. She offered us a quick appetizer like chips and salsa to help but we were good. We appreciated the customer service more than anything.   Overall the food was good the only thing I was not a big fan of was the street corn with my combo meal"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times and been very satisfied with the service and the food. I always order appetizer southern rolls my favorite."}
{"text":"Chili's is usually our go to spot for a nice quick meal and maragritas which are awesome.  Our last visit however was pretty disappointing.  We ordered our usual, cajun chicken  pasta.  When we got our meal, which was a longer wait than usual, it tasted very salty!  So we asked the server for a side of alfredo sauce.  It took them even longer just for a side of sauce.  Finally when we got the sauce, put it on our food, it was cold!  So we just gave up on our meal and asked for our check, also advising our server that the food was super salty, and that the sauce was cold and we were not happy with what we were served.  She asked if we wanted anything else, of course we said no since we were already turned off.  She just gave us our check, didn't offer a discount or apology or anything!  So it was like she didn't care that we were not happy with our service.  That type of service was just unexpected but I guess it just wasn't the servers day."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Tavia helped me last Saturday when I came in. What a sweetheart!!  My Mom recently passed away and I was on my way home from her house, after we packed up all of her belongings to sell her home.  Very sad.  Am so glad I made a quick decision to stop for a bite at Chilis that night. Tavia made my night!  Very nice, so genuine and absolutely wonderful. She was very kind and honestly she really lifted my spirits. PLUS, of course my food was fabulous, as always. Chilis is always a fantastic place to eat at.  Delicious meals every time, warm, cozy atmosphere and awesome employees, like Tavia, and that makes a great restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Ate here tonight and had the best service I've ever had anywhere! Zoe was such a fun and smart server. We keep coming back and always call to see if Zoe is working and only come when she's working because she's so great. The food was amazing and so well priced. THANKS ZOE! You rock."}
{"text":"I went to Chili's Bar and Grill in Macedonia yesterday for my birthday with my family. The appetizers were great! Our entrees came out nice and hot. I always get the Crispy Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers. The wait for our food was short. We had a nice waiter who was even willing to change the closest t.v. to a basketball game my family and I wanted to watch.   I really like this restaurant."}
{"text":"Probably my first review of a major chain restaurant...meeting some family here, so didn't have a choice of location lol.  Been years since I have been to a Chili's, so can't say how it fares across board, but it is decent food at good prices here.  Probably more on the cheap end actually with those 2 for $20 deals.  Went with the baby backs, the more tangy sauce....the ribs were pretty tender, fairly easy to pull apart off the bone.  A good rib, just not a great rib.  I am getting spoiled with these more spendy BBQ places in town.  Tried the burger, again, decent but not great.  Same thing, becoming jaded with all the exceptional burger spots in town.  Had the jalapeno fries or whatever they call them as our app.  Not bad, wish they layered the cheese and goodies though, since all the fries on the bottom go naked.  Service was a little slow, but we had a big group, so I chalk it up to that.  Won't really ding them for that in our case.  Overall, this will be a good Chili's to attend, if you want Chili's.  Otherwise, keep searching Yelp for better craving reducers!"}
{"text":"We always sit at the bar.  The bartenders are always lovely.   Its Chilli's - we go out of laziness mostly.   The drinks are good,  the food....is Chilli's.  I usually eat an appetizer as a meal and am annoying by asking them not to put all the unhealthy crap on things just so I don't feel like I'm at a McDonald's on crack."}
{"text":"Okay I'm not very big on Chili's style restraunts.  But having said that, I had a pretty good time there on Saturday. Bryan (the bartendar), and Brad (the manager) do a good job over there.  They treat everyone like regulars and make sure you have every thing you need to enjoy your visit. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Has anyone been to this Chili's lately. No. Good, you are not missing anything. Went there with my son and had a hamburger. And seriously, the hamburger was so greasy that it seeped into the bun, which turned into a glob. So disgusting. Spoke with the manager and he gave me a 5 dollar gift certificate. Yahoo...NOT! As hard as he tried to be nice about the whole thing, I think he was a bit agitated that I was cutting into his football game. Ugh!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service from Savannah and Christian! Love the changing and evolving menu at Chilis too. The new fresh pickles are so tasty!!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Other than cold beer and good chips & salsa, there's not much to like here. I think they need a new manager or better management training."}
{"text":"They were great. We had a large group in for lunch. The servers were super nice. The food was standard Chills fare. For the price I think we all got more food than we could eat."}
{"text":"Everything was alright the only thing I really wanted was the chicken tortilla soup in which our waiter forgot and didn't bring  but it is Friday so maybe next time"}
{"text":"So this was a bad idea... I saw the low star rating and thought ah it can't be that bad. We did not even make it past starters . We got the trio starter sampler - the cheese curds had a crazy amount of seasoning dumped on top of them - along with all the burnt bits from the fryer- the southwest chicken egg rolls were soggy and had little bits of burnt bits in it ... the manager of course was polite but wanted to explain to me why this happen, like it was just a part of life and ok ?? We left, they did not charge us for the uneaten food which was good but we still had to rush off to our next event with no dinner."}
{"text":"This was an ok experience.  There was nothing bad, but nothing exciting either.  I went at lunchtime and was seated promptly.  The server came right away and was nice.    The food was alright.  It didn't taste bad or come out cold, the quality is just a little lacking. Maybe some freshness could spice up the menu."}
{"text":"Located near Gate C50, Chili's maintains its easy going menu and ambiance. Service is good, menu rather economical for an airport restaurant and plenty of space.  I tried the Santa Fe Chicken Salad which comes with crisp tortilla chips, mexican salsa, guacamole, greens and a garlic bread. Everything was fresh. Had standard Mojito or rather a Snu-jito as they have it on the menu.  Servers were nice ladies so asked if I was enjoying my meal and promptly served up the drink, food and of course, the bill.  No regrets!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night and got sat right away. It's wasn't crazy busy like every other place so that's a plus. Service here is really nice and attentive. They have their new kiosk where you're able to order a few selected items off their menu and you can pay your bill on it too. VERY convenient if your server ever got really busy and you were in a hurry to leave. My boyfriend did have an issue with their 6 oz steak, for some reason this one was a bit chewy but our server apologized and without any hesitation took the whole plate and suggested we try it again. They cooked it on the fly and was out in literally 5 minutes and the steak was 100% better and the broccoli and mashed potatoes were amazing. Don't be discouraged with their steaks the server explained that they are one of the most popular items and if it's chewy then you probably were just one of the unfortunate ones that got a bad part of the cut."}
{"text":"Consistently bad food.  Bad like as in it seems like it's been sitting around for hours!  Waiters everywhere but still bad service. And they always sit us next to the table with the kid that can't sit down when most of the place is empty."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night and it took over 1.5 hours   We were seated right away and then nothing for 15 minutes.  The hostess actually came back and took our drink order and another 10 minutes our drinks were delivered.  Finally an actual waitress came and took our order.  Food took at least 20 minutes to come out   I ordered the buffalo chicken salad and my husband the trio fajitas. The salad was yummy. The steak and chicken were good for the fajitas but the shrimp was gross   Normally we like chili's but this experience was horrible"}
{"text":"Great waitress!! She was super friendly and got our orders right and quick to us. The blackberry margaritas we had were DELICIOUS!!!  The queso yum yum yummy!!  Great experience overall!!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service.  Took 20 mins to get chips n salsa.  I ordered a bowl of soup for an appetizer 35 mins later still don't have it.  Been here 50 mins...... Still no food  Maybe poorly managed Maybe understaffed  Maybe not coming back"}
{"text":"The food is so delicious! And the servers in the bar are so nice!"}
{"text":"Had really good service for lunch, one of our regular favorite spots. Rebecca was great, always had drinks and food came out fast."}
{"text":"Came in was a little busy (Tuesday night) waited a few minutes for the hostess to \"wipe down\" a table. ..when sat the table still had food on it.  Server was extremely slow. ..& 75% of the time another server was checking on us, dropping food, even our check.  ...stupid, you need more personable servers.  & my food was over-cooked & burnt ..  I only give it 2 stars because their new berry cake dessert is amazing ...     *Update went during lunch -3:30-4 pm, had an amazing server. He really paid attention to the table.! & our two little ones, I think I rather the lunch service than dinner (rude, & always missing servers) so I'll change to 4 stars :p"}
{"text":"We come here at least 1x a week and had had little to no issues. They do get very busy on weekends and it could be a long wait. This is my husbands favorite restraunt!! Always delicious food!!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience ordering online.  My order was not correct, when I explained what I ordered, Sarah, the bartender, didn't want to look at my order, which I pulled up on my phone - she just walked away.  When she came back with one of the burgers, she tells me they didn't make the other one correct either.  I asked to speak to a manager.  He comes out - blames it on the online ordering system (which I agree, is terrible), never apologizes. I told him I'm mad that I pre-tipped when I prepaid online.  Didn't offer refund or anything - just asks if there is anything else he can do to make my order correct.  Will be a long time before I give them my business again!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Honey-Chipotle Chicken Crispers. They were OK, but practically swimming in the sauce, which was overly sweet. And my draft Sierra Nevada did not taste right for some reason. Other than that, service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I hardly ever go to chain restaurants but went to this dump for a friend. The seats had crumbs on them and table was sticky, I did ask to have it wiped off after we were sat.  It took a little over 15 minutes to get a drink from the bar. I could see the girl supposed to be tending bar on her phone, but not making drinks. Manager's sitting at a small booth chatting and texting. Do people here want to make money?   No problems with the food thankfully. It was on par with Denny's.   Good place to buy a gift card for someone you dislike."}
{"text":"I work nearby and we eat at this location about 3 times a month. Today, we ordered  takeout.   I don't know who was working in the kitchen, or if they ran out of takeout boxes. When I order a meal... chicken crisper today, I don't expect all components to have their own box.  When you order for an office of 6-10 people, and 1/2 of us have 3 little boxes per person???    I do understand that sometimes things happen. Maybe you DID run out of containers. You think maybe you could COMMUNICATE that? You think MAYBE you could put some plates in, so I could eat my lunch like normal instead of these little white boxes?    I don't expect much from big chain restaurants. Guess you haven't done anything to change my mind."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give zero stars I would. Simply put, this Chili's SUCKS!!!   Very slow service, indifferent attitudes from the staff, and when you bring a problem to the managements attention they could care less.  Chili's food, company wide, has been going down hill for a long time. However, poor service and indifferent employee attitudes is a direct reflection on the management.  There are too many great dining choices in the North Hills. Please heed my warning and do not waste your money here.  My family and I will NEVER return!"}
{"text":"Completely over it. Every time we go here there is a problem - never with the server but always with the lack of proper staffing. This time our server was the bartender who was clearly overworked. She took our order for drinks and our appetizer but then after that became so slammed with other bar customers and other customers drink orders that coming back for our entree order was clearly forgotten. After we got our appetizer (which clearly sat under the heat lamp too long) we opted to leave instead of waiting around any longer. As we were paying we noticed the bartender venting to the manager about the lack of staffing and needing help- who instead of helping her gave her a very uncomfortably looking hug and walked away. Clearly management needs better training on personal boundaries and how to help employees so they don't walk out or quit. This will be the last time we make an effort to go to this Chili's- which is a shame due to the closeness of where we live."}
{"text":"Gad dinner at this place on wednesday around 830p, they wete not busy took 10 min to get helped ordered wings 30 minutes went by no food so i asked bar why so slow in food.. terrible will never eat there sgain"}
{"text":"Ehhh, Chili's is adequate if not astonishing.   I last came to this West Mifflin Chili's franchise in 2003. Then unemployed, I was being treated to lunch by my sympathetic mother and bought Metallica's St. Anger fresh from the factory with what little cash I had on hand at The Exchange in nearby Century Square...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejYUoNfDgUY  It turned out that I liked St. Anger a bit more than my meal.   Last night, Kay discovered a gift card for Chili's in the abyss of her satchel. To the wilds of West Mifflin we headed to redeem it only to wait 20 minutes for a table amongst suburban families and Harley-Davidson aficionados.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-H3LS2m3b0  The salsa we were given was more like a cold, spicy soup. The tortilla chips were akin to eggshells, falling apart in the salsa and the dismal mud of the Skillet Queso, a dull quagmire of cheese, beans, and tiny morsels of beef.   Kay wanted no part of the guacamole, so to quell my superfood craving, I ordered the Avocado Burger...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI6Ab3ZCMSY  Cooked to a medium-rare as per my specifications, the patty, humid, thick, and perfectly fine in every way,  came inside a whole wheat bun with Swiss cheese, avocado slices, and an \"avocado-ranch\" to make it a bit more intriguing than the standard bacon-cheeseburger.   The thick fries were a bit too starchy and mushy on the insides. Am I who I think I am? A discerning fan of spuds dunked in hot oil?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o22qU9-Lxuw  Hey, it's my favorite track off the record. I had to find a way to work it into the review somehow.   Onto dessert...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58-AndGTKy0  Something tells me the Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie is Chili's best dessert. Call it a hunch, something I can't quite point at?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRfKfBSWRp0  A warm cookie dough with nuts, coconut shreds, hot fudge, caramel, and vanilla ice cream is an easy crowd-pleaser considering every other such restaurant has a similar item on their menus. Hot-n-gooey met cold-n-creamy, married, and had a respectable child.   That's Chili's: Respectable and not much more, and like the album St. Anger, I like the place more now than I did 9 summers ago. They are what Mad Mex would become if Bob Rock got a hold of them.   P.S. Chili's used to have an onion blossom appetizer on their menu once, didn't they? If so, would that make it Mustaine or Newsted? Can we expect a new band or side-project? Will it defect to another restaurant like Jason did with Voivod?  P.P.S. Shamefully, two of the waitresses came off like Lars and James, tyrannizing another poor server as if she was Kirk. Ours was more on the Robert Trujillo side; she was new and just stayed out of it. Nonetheless, it was uncalled for. Tense, awkward, and painful to witness,  it certainly hindered the enjoyment of our dinner a notch."}
{"text":"Terrible food. I had the chicken crispers. All I could taste was the oil. Either the oil was old or they were re-cooked. One person had the babyback ribs (which Chili's is known for). I don't believe they were babyback ribs. Flavorless with little meat.  Third member had margarita chicken that was dried out and tough. A manager apologized and offered replacements. We declined and paid the bill and left. Won't be back and wouldn't recommend this place unless you go for the drinks."}
{"text":"Lunch is busy here so get ready to wait a little. The host is with a smile and you see that everyone are working. The food is comfort food you can't go wrong with it.  I love the unlimited soup and salad here. Tasty and hot :)  Night time is a more relaxed time here to come have a quick and relaxed dinner."}
{"text":"I came at a busy hour, 4:00 ish and my server was very rude. He spoke to me like I was dumb and I felt very disrespected. I ordered my food without bacon because bacon was in the description (not eating pork is a personal choice of mine) and he brought my food out with bacon, I didn't say anything, I just picked it off but what if i was allergic?? They don't care. And when I asked about the military discount, (I served in the US Navy) he rolled his eyes and said \"yeah we have it but that doesn't include your alcohol.\" When it was time to pay, I waited 20+ minutes for him to pick up the check and when he did, he snatched it from my hands. This establishment needs to work on their customer service and treat service members with respect. Will not be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Seriously, don't come to this location.   We actually really enjoy the food, but have yet to receive anything close to acceptable service.   Tonight we came in, as we had vouchers from our last visit. Our last visit was the single most  offensive dining experience I've ever had. The waiter was racist, and told us how he gives up any tables that might be Hispanic, because, and I'm quoting here, \"I don't speak Mexican, and it's too confusing.\" Like, seriously? Then he continued on with the racism train and did a ridiculously stereotypical Asian accent. Like South Park bad. I told management and was given a voucher. Ok, fine second chance time.  Tonight was not much better. True there was no racism, thankfully, but that waiter is still employed. So that's cool. Good to know that Chili's supports racist assholes. Service was pretty awful. Appetizer came out after the food, a personal pet peeve of mine, and that's about when our server dropped off the face of the earth. Finally found out he was out back smoking. He could have at least brought us the beverages he promised 5 minutes before he disappeared before vanishing for an extra 20. Finally got another server, who seemed awesome, to bring us our beverages. So thanks random waiter for being better than anyone who's actually served us there.  Will not be returning to this location a third time."}
{"text":"The same people who say they've never been to a Chilis are probably the same people who've never seen Star Wars. Freaky group.  So since we all know what to expect it seems the food has gone downhill lately.  It was never The French Laundry to begin with but always reliable, affordable goods.  Now the food is not as fresh and pricier. I know Americans can rival the dinosaurs in body mass but they cut the portion size!  They can at least give those with no regard for cardiac consequences the choice of smaller portions.  I know change can be good but Chilis changed why I went there."}
{"text":"Once past security your options are very limited. So, we decided to grab something at Chili's! Starting with the person seating you at the front entrance the staff was tragic! They really could care less that you are there. The menu's we were given  were beyond disgusting as they were sticky and covered with all sorts of who knows what! I ordered a bloody Mary after we were seated and at 15 minutes it had yet to arrive and the place was not even full, so this seemed extreme! I decided the waiter had forgot. Well from where we were seated at about 20 minutes after ordering I see him go over to the bartender and order the bloody Mary. Two minutes later he walks the drink over to our table and says, \"sorry for the delay, the bar is really backed up\"! LOL! Please!!! The really sad part is this dump is probably always busy  as there are very few other dining options in this gate. As the place is located in an airport their business I am sure has very little repeat customers, so what do they care!  Next time in the Vegas airport I will be sure to find a different option for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the 2 for $35.00 Valentine's Day special. 2 Presidente Margarita's. Brought them in their own shaker got almost 3 glass fulls.  Enjoyed the Panko Onion Rings for our app., entrees were grilled chicken fajitas and the 6 oz. sirloin"}
{"text":"I love Chili's,  but this location is odd.  Great bartenders, but food is so-so.  Recommend the guacamole!  Table service is just okay.  Kind of disappointed:/"}
{"text":"Called in a Togo order I ordered the 6oz sirloin with grilled shrimp I asked for the are steak to be rare and paid a $ more do a salad. They told me it would be 15-20 min when I arrived at the restaurant I was completely ignored everyone I asked said just a minute well after 30 min they finally brought out my order I paid and left not checking if my order was correct I didn't get any shrimp my steak was close to well done no silver wear  never again this isn't the first time never again"}
{"text":"Went yesterday (Friday) for my birthday. Was seated quickly and even was able to choose which booth we wanted.   Our server Brian was awesome. He kept our drinks topped off and made sure we were never in need of anything. Originally we ordered the Queso Skillet and Chips and an order of fried onion rings. Both arrived fairly quickly yet both needed to be returned just as quickly. The chips were so salty it came with a side of High Blood Pressure. The Queso was subpar. Tasted as if it had been sitting all night. The onion rings were so overly cooked and burnt that my husband refused to have them remake them. We did choose to have them swap out the original Queso for White Spinach Queso and it was actually one of the best appetizers I've tasted in awhile. They really did regain themselves with that one.   In addition to my appetizer we ordered two kids meals that weren't bad for the price and hubby and I split a Mix and Match Trio platter with an extra order of shrimp. The hubby said his steak was really tender, seasoned well, and cooked to perfection. The vegetables were charred very nicely without being over cooked or mushy. The warm tortilla shells were a pleasant contrast to the cool creaminess of the sour cream and guacamole. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the hint of spicy was just right.   I had the Triple Berry Margarita on the rocks. Another awesome for Chili's. So much so that I had to order another! They weren't skimpy on the alcohol nor was the flavor over bearing.   Sometime during our meal my husband was able to sneak away and let the staff know it was my birthday because halfway through the meal they came out with a vanilla scoop ice cream topped with hot fudge. Pretty basic since the hubby said the lady next to us who also had a birthday was brought a slice of fudge cake. But hey, it's free and unexpected so I was happy! Especially since I had no room for dessert and my girls ate it anyway   Other than having to return our original appetizers, our dinner and waiter was awesome! Price wasn't too expensive. They applied the 10% military discount to all items except alcohol so it allowed for a nice tip for our waiter. We usually add the 10% we get off on top of their normal tip. I know he was happy."}
{"text":"Excellent service, just went for dinner with the family,  probably the best service even though it was fairly busy,  food was excellent and out server Desiree was great"}
{"text":"I started this review on the little receipt machine Chili's is starting to get their customers to use when it's time to pay. Unfortunately, the machine decided to suddenly kick me out, so I'm posting the review here instead.  Our visit to Chili's was fantastic. We had been in LA in October and saw TV commercials for the first time in years. Surprise surprise, Chili's is blasting commercials about their new baby back ribs all. The. Time.  Fast forward to today, and we're deciding on grub. Ribs come to mind, and so we head to Chili's. Now, Chili's in general has never really been on my list of places to go for food... It's not that anything is notably wrong or bad... It's just that for the most part, Chili's has been a heavy hitting contender on my mediocre list.  Today was an exception... Today, we had Adriana as our server. She was AMAZING! Courteous, fast, and knowledgeable about the menu, and she was ALWAYS smiling! People don't often realize, but a smile makes a big difference in how people perceive you! She always seemed to be right on time with refills, without interrupting our flow of conversation.  She's definitely the reason we'll be returning to Chili's. Thanks Adriana! You are a rock star!"}
{"text":"I eat here regularly and have always had a great experience. The staff is great and the food is really good. We always eat from the 2 for $20 menu which includes an appetizer. You pay on a computer at your rather than having to wait on your waiter. I recommend this restaurant to couples."}
{"text":"The food is so!!!! Good.  Steak is amazing! Everything is really  Tasty and delicious. The Texas fries  Are incredible also. It's our new family FAVORITE  dinner location. The ribs are pretty good too."}
{"text":"This has always been our go to restaurants, because out of all of them we could count on great food and great service.  This time something was just \"a little off \". The Chips & Spinach n Artichoke Dip seemed different, not at all what I am used to. Not good, not bad, just \"different\", and it's usually amazing!  The fall off the bone ribs weren't falling off the bones (our ribs at home are MUCH Better!) and the atmosphere was unusually quiet, too quiet and I felt out of place.  Maybe it's the time of day..?  We usually go at night and will only go for dinner from now on. We've always been satisfied in the past and I'm hoping there hasn't been a change in ownership that is to blame.."}
{"text":"Good food however a little slow in the bar as far as service. Need a couple more servers sitting for about 10 min now and no server..... Come on now pull your selves together...."}
{"text":"Good food good happy hour... service was great I was surprised to see the managers actually cleaning when slow.  Nice job !!"}
{"text":"We had a GREAT experience here today! The hostess and waitress were extremely nice and helpful! We will return again soon!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!! The waitress was quite disinterested in our questions or concerns.  The food took forever to come from the kitchen and it was cold and unappealing!!! I ordered the shrimp tacos, the cabbage was limp and the avocado slices were actually just a few chunks of browning avocado. The shrimp appeared to be a weird pinkish color with an even worse texture. The rice was dry and tasteless. The black beans were edible."}
{"text":"I really like this Chilis. We have had the same server several times, June, who was just so friendly and efficient! The food always comes out perfect and we rarely have had to wait for a table. I've had a couple of other good servers, one young kid who has ear plugs and another young blonde girl. I wish I could remember their names! We had a new employee help us once and we did wait an obnoxious amount of time for our food, I know they usually tag team for tables, so I don't know why the other person wasn't helping him, but the new kid was so sweet and very apologetic so it made up for the wait. Anyway, I recommend this Chilis, it seems really well run in comparison to the other ones I have been to."}
{"text":"Where to begin! Sent back a salad twice because of raw shrimp! The waitress was very sweet and nice. The place. Hmm. We had mosquitoes swarming over and under the table. ( or were they fruit flies? Not sure they stung!). I honestly don't think the manager cared that a dish was sent back twice for the same reason!! Never showed up to speak to us. The waitress took it off the bill."}
{"text":"Well it has been years since I have eaten here and I cant believe what I just spent 50 dollars on.  The servers and staff were kind and doing their jobs... but the food was completely awful.  We got the guacamole burger. steak fajitas and my kid got the mac and cheese.  It was as if they went to smiths and purchased a bunch of canned and packaged processed food and stuck it in the microwave.   The steak was burnt like charcoal and has zero taste other than char.  The bell peppers were in giant undercooked hard chunks.  The onions were in big inch thick chunks.  It was as if it was cut by a 5 year old.  There was no seasoning on anything.  All the food had no taste.  The cheese was bagged crap cheese with anti caking agents and the beans tasted like wet aluminum.  The tortillas were like the bread like junky ones you get at a grocery store.  The salsa was so bland I would have rather had tostitos to be honest.     And now to the burger... all the salt that was earmarked for our entire table was put on her burger.... How can you even mess up a burger..??  A child could make a better burger....  My kids mac and cheese was supposed to be kraft... and it was... except it was pretty much the sticky microwaved 3 days later version and had zero cheese taste.  His oranges were the same exact del monte kind you get for a dollar at walmart.  Why is this place always so busy?  How can people pay 17 dollars to eat canned and low quality processed junk food?  The only thing decent was the chips...after i put salt on them.. why did i even eat here?   Take the same money and go to macaroni grill or something...   2 stars simply because the service was good."}
{"text":"Chilli's is always a tasty spot to be, this location specifically was not too bad.  We walked in and sat at the bar, I'd say at least two employees seen us and no one said anything.  Which is cool, I understand that restaurants get busy and all but some type of acknowledgement would have been nice.  Other than that, the taco were very good and hit the spot before an event I had to attend."}
{"text":"To start off, our server was great. The kids meals were fine. But, we had chicken fajita meat that looked like it had been grilled on 1 side. What happened to the blackened chicken? The onions almost tasted bitter. Maybe it sat in the \"sizzle sauce\" to long. I know, it's a Chili's. But it is still money."}
{"text":"Chili's is changing their menu...for the better!  They had surprising new selections & healthier side dishes.  My husband got a cheeseburger with fries, he thought it was pretty good.  I tried their shrimp tacos with a side of quinoa wheat berry & sweet corn on the cob...AMAZING!  I definitely would order it again and go back soon. Only problem is the service and cleanliness of the restaurant...very slow and they can do so much better."}
{"text":"Best chicken tenders ever, but you have to ask for the original way and dunk hem in honey mustard. Their fries and corn on the cob are also good."}
{"text":"the top self fish tacos are to die for I eat there at least once a month I also love their baby back ribs but my new favorite are the tacos."}
{"text":"We walked up to the hostess and had to wait for her to come back to reality because she kept staring off into nothing ahead of her. She led us to a table and just placed our menus on the table and left, not a word. OK. It took us a few minutes to look over the menu then placed them down on the table indicating that we're ready to order. (Mind you that we still haven't been acknowledged by anyone, especially our mystery waiter-- did they even exist?!) We flagged down the waiter across the way (short, bald guy) and tried to ask him who our waiter was, but before we could even get to mid-sentence he keeps waltzing by and says over his shoulder, \"She's coming. She's coming.\" OK. Thanks? A few more minutes go by and still nothing (Note: They were NOT that busy!); we had to try to refrain from showing our annoyance because we didn't want anyone messing with our [pending] food order. Finally, we just WALKED OUT... WTF??? I used to work in the service industry and this entire place was a POS from the start!!! All those negative reviews about this place seem more legit to me now!"}
{"text":"I've been to many locations and this one was okay. The food didn't seem to be as good and the staff seemed to be unsure of what they were supposed to do. It was bizarre how different the atmosphere was from other Chilis ."}
{"text":"Showed up last night to have dinner. It was probably about 730pm. There was no one at the front greeting people. We waited and waited for someone to show up but no one came so we ended up leaving and going to dinner somewhere else. It was busy with people dinning but no one even acknowledged us. I'm giving 3 stars because we've been there before and it was good service."}
{"text":"I came to this location on Valentines Day, with my daughter. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The managers were there to greet us at the door, and proceeded to stop by each table twice throughout the meal to make sure everything went well. Our server was great and attentive. Food was great! Out of all Chilis locations that I have been to, this was by far the best experience."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and Brian was amazing.  He was nice, professional and took care of us!  He was so attentive and we got our drinks quickly and he was so friendly!  Our food was so good!  Ask for Brian if you go in there."}
{"text":"So my friends came in for lunch because we were in the mood for something tasty and quick other than jus basic fast food. We all had burgers. They were all so delish! And flavorful! Stephanie was our waiter and she was a good waitress . She refilled our drinks at least 7 times good thing they have free refills! We'll definiteley be back!"}
{"text":"My server was Dani. She was awesome! She smiled the whole time and was extremely friendly. She suggested my meal and that is what I ordered.  So good on her for making my trip to Chili's enjoyable.   It was still just Chili's food though. Not sure I like the new menu. The shiner bock burger was great. Why did they get rid of it?"}
{"text":"It was close and I was hungry with a lot of work to do back at the hotel. The greeter seated me quickly. The waiter really didn't want to give me the time of day. There was a co-waitress, she just dumped my food on the table and ran off. I had to flag down the waiter and take another tables napkins. He must have been Guessing that my food wasn't greasy at this Chili's.  The food was OK. Could have used Ketchup but good luck getting that."}
{"text":"I have always tried to love Chili's but something always goes wrong here, whether it's forgetting an order, over charging me, or not getting a refill after multiple times asking. I came in with my party on a weekend night and wait time was between 10 to 15 minutes.   After we got seated we waited about 10 minutes to get our waters. Then we waited another 10 minutes before we were ready to place our order. Our server was really nice and as busy as he seemed with his other tables I seen the effort in him trying to ensure we were getting in and out quick with our food. It took 20 minutes for our food to come out and I ordered the Honey Garlic Steak & Shrimp with broccoli and mash potatoes, plus a side of fries. Portioning was a 2/5, the shrimp and steak was super small - of course it didn't look like how it would in the menu. Presentation was 3/5, steamed broccoli was very hard, mash potatoes had melted cheese on top but it was dried up, and hard. Taste was 3/5, mash potatoes and broccolis were dried and hard, shrimp simply just tasted like salt, and the steak was okay. My side of fries were forgotten so I had to wait another 10 minutes for it to come out. It was frustrating but in the mean time I needed a drink refill so I either way I had to wait, and put my eating on hold.   Price for mine and my fiancè's plate plus a drink was about $30 including tax and without tip. If you want to split tabs then do it on their pad that they have at the table, it makes things more convenient for a large group. Our server was probably only the best part about my experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Every single time I've came in my waitress is amazing and the food is spot on. We had Adam tonight and I've never had better service. Definitely the best chilis I've ever been to! The lava cake dessert is amazing btw"}
{"text":"Personally when I ate here my experience was as it is at every chili's I've ever been to.. tasty... reliable.. and incredibly unhealthy. I'm off topic here but how depressing is it that most of their salads have over 1000 calories? Damnit you can't even try to eat healthy here."}
{"text":"I went to Chili's on North Decatur Boulevard in the Costco Center approximately 4 days ago. Quite possibly, it's the worst dining experience I've ever had. From the wait staff being extremely rude, no silverware or napkins. Waited 45 minutes to have the server say she could only bring my wife and my son's food because mine wasn't done yet and they couldn't bring them all together because the warming area in  the kitchen was broken. My son's broccoli was ice cold as well as  the french fries. My wife said her food was okay but she's not one to complain. I finally got my burger which took 55 minutes  to receive. It was okay it was a little cool, fries were cold. Complained to the manager and the manager's response was \" I'm not the manager here I'm only filling in and I know our kitchen is having  major issues tonight \". The manager did take off about half the bill which in my opinion should have been the entire bill. He also gave us $10 in coupons to come back which I never will step foot in that restaurant again. The last time I went to that Chili's was approximately 6 years ago, had a very bad experience six years ago I promised I would never go back and did, and this is what happened. Would give it a zero-star but the system will not allow me to do that.  This restaurant is a complete joke. Strongly advise to stay far away from it. Dave L  Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Came here with my buddy Wilson and sister Joyce for dinner and their Black Cherry Lemonade was delicious!  So delicious I drank two!  I'm quite confident they used real cherries because it facilitated a bowel movement like no other.....everything came out black!  No kidding either!  This location was clean, the service was quite fast, and the waitress was friendly, attentive and kind.  The food was pretty standard, it tasted just like the other Chili's location I been to.  We ordered a steak fajita, some chips with this cheesy bean dip, and a loaded potato soup.    Overall a good experience and a fun night, be sure to try the Black Cherry Lemonade, just limit yourself to one, you'll thank me later for this tip."}
{"text":"Been here many times, and every time I needed to do a two almost immediately after the meal.  My body just doesn't like this place or their food.    I tried many different items from this place, from their quesadillas, pizzas, fresh mex bowl, burgers, all the way to their baby back, baby back, baby back ribs.  All were super tasty and all didn't stay too long in the belly.  The ribs lasted the longest with a record of 16 minutes and 35 seconds.   This location has always been clean and inviting, the staff has always been friendly and polite and funny.  The service has always been moderate to slow.  Never been fast, but they always been busy too.    Overall this location is good and I don't see why I wouldn't come back!"}
{"text":"Not sure what is going on at this location as it's gone from decent to terrible within the past year. We have lived here for 6 years now and have frequented this location hundreds of times. I have always like chili's so after having one bad experience after the next, I am finally done! The service has been terribly slow, the food has gotten really bad. On our last two visits during lunch (not busy either time) we waited over 40 minutes for our food. On both occasions the food was cold! The server apologized as she even said we shouldn't have to wait that long. She told us she was going to send the manager over. He offered to get is something else. Why would I want to wait another 40 minutes. Then he doesn't offer anything. Really?? Worst Chili's ever! Don't waste your time and money here!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!  Little girl pulled fire alarm and the manager could not turn it off. Everyone clapped when he finally shut it off ten minutes later.  Our kiosk would not work so I could not order dessert . I had to get my own box from the counter. I had to sign myself into the waiting list.  My wife's Cajun pasta was cold. So they remade it. They didn't make it right so she had to rereorder. My point is chiles has become apples bees."}
{"text":"This place fails to realize that it is in an airport terminal.  This is the third time I've tried to get food here, but as always, was told it would be 25-30 minutes at the 2go counter.   This is an unacceptable time to wait for food at an airport.   And, it was at 2pm which was not a busy time.    Rude lady at the to-go counter as well, so  went elsewhere and had my food within a few minutes.  I can understand a bit of a longer experience if one wishes to sit down in the restaurant,  but an airport to-go service needs to at least attempt to show efficiency.  10 mins or less is reasonable.   25-30 is not.   Today was my last attempt.   I'll gladly take my business to other restaurants who seem to understand their location and the associated time constraints that their patrons experience with traveling."}
{"text":"Bar Review only!  Mon-thursday: all day happy hour on beers and well drinks.  Free chips and salsa in bar area...  Sign up online with Chili's to get coupons.  We had to buy a entree, but got an appetizer for free.  Also got good service in the bar area."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service ,Manager James came out and spoke to me and my family I thought  that was fantastic fast and good service and our server was amazing and she was very sweet : ) keep up the great work u guys ! Thank u for your awesome service"}
{"text":"Not sure why the majority of reviews are negative since I've never had an issue coming here over the years. Most recently got the 2 for $22 deal. Both half rack of ribs entrees were excellent with the House BBQ sauce. Meat fell right off the bones and fries were fresh from the fryer. Server was friendly and responsive when we asked for a refill on our drinks as well as chips and salsa appetizer. One time I did come for late night half-price apps and service was pretty slow but nothing that would keep me from coming again. The Ziosk machines are awesome so we could pay and tip right at the table."}
{"text":"Wish they would bring back fried cheese sticks abd fried apples! Finally got app to work! Yea!"}
{"text":"We live a couple blocks from Chili's, and have been regular customers for a number of years now. The menu is very deversified and those choices are outstanding! Our visit today was very enjoyable, and our hostess Wendy did a great job in spite of how busy it was. Her professionalism, promptness, and service is second to none, and we have frequented many restaurants. Thank you Wendy!! Manager:  Please pass this five star review to Wendy. Thank you.... Mike L.  Tramonto"}
{"text":"Always great experience with my favorite bartender Amy! Most days I come to chili's just to visit her."}
{"text":"We have gone to this chain many many times before, never an issue until last night.  Our server Angie was a disappointment. She took a good 15mins before she even came over to greet us and take our drink order. She insisted on taking our drink order first and then once we had our drinks she would take our order. Little did we know it would take another 10mins for them to arrive. We did not see her wait on anyone else, so why the lateness??? Who knows?   We waited a good 45 mins for our food, during that time no drink refills were offered. We asked different servers twice, nothing. We asked the hostess for napkins when she was nearby seating others, she said she would and we never saw her again. Finally when our food arrive we asked Angie for drinks and napkins. It still took another 10mins. At this time we told her she should be asking other servers for help if was overwhelmed...... her reply \"I did but they were busy too\"   I don't think that's true as there were empty tables around us.... servers cleaning and clearing tables.   We spent two hours there, two hours too long. The only reason I gave them 3 stars was because of the food. The food was fine, it's the service that really disappointed us and ruin our dinner. Never again will we be back to this particular Chili's.  A little note to Angie: after your initial late arrival, we could careless about your personal life. That will not make up for the 15mins we had been waiting for you to take our order. Just apologize and take the order."}
{"text":"Don't do it! Go somewhere else!!!!! My daughter had a hair in her quesadilla, our chicken crispers tasted like fish, and even the fries were old. They offer nothing to make it right, only took the quesadilla off the bill."}
{"text":"Went by to try out the new Texas style ribs. Lots of meat but it looked like my wife's Baby Back ribs were bigger and even weighed more. Guess I will go back to the Baby Backs. The corn on the cob was great. Got the chips and guacamole to start and could have stopped with that as there was so much good guacamole."}
{"text":"This location is now closed. It looks like it is being converted into a Kay Jewelers and there's nothing indicating they'll be opening another Chili's there.  Sorry to see it go! I love Chili's."}
{"text":"I always have a great dining experience when Cameo is our server. She busts her butt all day to make sure you are comfortable. As for the food it's average for this type of restaurant. I enjoy the 2 for $20 deal because you get an appetizer and two entrees.   Tonight's experience was interesting. We were seated immediately by a waiter. A group of four women with too much perfume sat next to our table. We asked our waiter to move and he really didn't pay attention to us. I stood up because I couldn't take that strong perfume smell diffusing throughout the room... all I could taste was the perfume! I walked to the bar area and told the hostess the situation and she cleared a table for us A.S.A.P; it worked out that Cameo was working that area and became our new waitress. That guy, who's name I didn't get, was rather rude to us and didn't seem to care.  B.T.W: Cameo is a great waitress. She works hard for little in return! We appreciate the over-the-top service you provided."}
{"text":"I have been complaining about how dirty this specific toilet has been for over a year. Every time I go here, this is even worse. The rest of the building is just as filthy and the manager just makes excuses. Dirt hanging from the rafters in the dining room, but I didn't take a picture. I don't even want to know what the kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"The service at our visit during lunch was terrible. Took my entire lunch break to get our food, I had to box it up and eat at my desk back at work. Refills were ignored, had to hunt down a waitress for a box. The restaurant smelled like urine. This isn't the first time, this location has been notorious for bad service for years now. This was the last shot, never going back. The food isn't good enough to deal with their crappy waitresses."}
{"text":"Awesome chilis. Best one we've been to. Their food is always spot on. The steak is always perfect, food is always hot and service is always fast. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I had a horrid experience, 100% accredited to our server, Tara.  I went to eat at 12pm today for lunch with some coworkers. We actually frequent this restaurant. We were greeted by the hostess and immediately sat. However, we waited well over 15 mins for our server to greet us. Only by request did she make her initial appearance.  When she finally came over, she was short, curt, and her demeanor stated she hated her job. No apology by her or a manager was offered for her late arrival. She ordered our food and brought it out promptly, but no check back to see if \"things were ok.\" She dropped the checks and snatched them from my hand as I paid. Perhaps because I was so irritated that this may be an exaggeration but I'll stick with that.  Overall, for me, the food is the \"finisher\" on my \"great experience\" at any restaurant. The server is the one that MAKES IT. For me, Tara was an absolute nightmare. Maybe she had a bad day, maybe there are issues going on, or maybe she just sucks. Regardless, she ruined our experience and if I had time to speak to a manager I would have but we were already running late to return for work.  So in short, don't get Tara as your server."}
{"text":"I've had really good service here over the past few times I've eaten here. This time was no exception. I ordered the Caribbean salad with grilled chicken. My wife got the triple dipper.  My salad was DELICIOUS! The chicken was juicy and blended well with the ingredients of the salad. This was my first time ordering this because I'm a creature of habit and always get the crispers.  Go check it out. Hopefully your visit will be as good as mine was."}
{"text":"When i arrived a waiter took our drink orders, i didn't see him again until he came out of the back with other workers to celebrate a customer's birthday. We waited patiently still, then another waiter came and took our drink orders. By this time, we had already been there over 20 minutes so we were ready to order. I ordered the original chicken crispers with a double order of the southwest mac and cheese and my wife had the southwest eggrolls. After the food arrived, my wife's eggrolls were burnt and my double southwest mac and cheese was mostly all cheese with very few noodles. Our waiter did not check on us throughout the meal and i never received a refill on my drink. The only time we saw him again was when i paid at the table and we were getting ready to walk out."}
{"text":"I ate here at 9pm thursday. I had a server her name is Jordan she was really nice. Thenmanager that night was really nice too."}
{"text":"I would give this location nothing less than a 5 star review! The service is by far some of the best service i have gotten at a chilis location in a long time. The past few times I have visited this location I had AMAZING service from Shannon! She always is warm and welcoming and she goes over and above to make my dining experience 110%. I will definitely be revisiting this location all because of the great experience! Great job Shannon!!!"}
{"text":"So your family is in town and they do not approve of anything \"Fixe.\"  You are pretty sure you think that they think that means you are doing \"the drugs.\"  You are going to Chili's, pal.  That's what these guys are here for -- a place everyone can nod at while you eat your fries and listen to how Aunt Ethel's goiter is doing.  The good thing about Chili's is that everything is very well-priced;  three people can get entrees and a giant starter for $40.  Good thing your Uncle who doesn't know you always sends you these gift cards for Chili's!   Perhaps he always knew you needed them;  because as you're there on these holiday eats,  nodding about Ethel's thyroid problems, you know that you certainly didn't want to directly pay for this to happen to you.  Did I mention there's a person whose sole job is to make balloon animal hats?  And that they are actually very attentive with drink refills?  Instant extra star."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised that the Chicken Chipotle bowl was really good. It had grilled chicken, tortilla chip pieces, like rice, corn and black bean salad, shredded cheese, veggies, including avocado slices. The fries and queso I ordered were good, too. The queso has a chili bean feel to it."}
{"text":"The bartender was friendly and attentive but not annoying. The food was good and served in a timely manner. There were numerous TV screens with good picture quality for us to watch the MLB home run derby on.  We took advantage of their 2 for $20 deal that gives us an appetizer to split and an entree each. I was pleasantly surprised that the entrees were full portions and not downsized for the promo. Nice place overall."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I was not greeted when I walked in the door and stood there for a long time before a bartender came to seat me. Even though there was almost nobody in the restaurant, it took almost 30 minutes to get my food, which is kind of ridiculous for a restaurant that is supposed to be fast paced dining. I ordered the buffalo chicken salad and asked for no cheese. When it came, finally, there was crumbled feta cheese all over it! They returned it and made me a new one, but I found a couple pieces of the cheese still in the salad. I think they just scooped off the top and gave me the same lettuce! And on top of that, the lettuce was wilted! I ordered the Presidente Margarita and I didn't get it for 10 minutes, which again is ridiculous because there was almost nobody in the restaurant. The margarita was good... salad was merely okay...I will never come back."}
{"text":"Craptacular service. The wait was long, my son wanted to go as an acknowledgment for a academic achievement. Waited over 30 mins when told 20 mins for a table. Take us to uncleaned table and now have to wait for it to be cleaned. Ordered 2 for $35, wanted a salad instead of potatoes or fries...$2 extra. Fine no problem even though on the menu it is a 60 cent difference. Got our meals, the salad was mixed greens only tossed in some oil...eeeww. No other veggies where on plate even though I was suppose to receive some; nope just steak and oily salad. The waiter was inattentive and unapproachable. He forgot drinks, had to flag down for refills and remind him about a dessert we ordered. We got their presidente margaritas which we have had before many times...totally mixer and water..no alcohol in these.  I have been to chili's many times and would not recommend this one. I don't expect five star service at chili's but I do expect some type of service and decent food, this establishment was none of that."}
{"text":"Easy to make To Go orders via online.  After placing the order, their website generated a timeline for pickup which was 20 minutes.  Upon arriving on time, I was promptly greeted and paid.  Unfortunately, it took another 15 minutes to get my order.  When I took my order home which was a 5 minute drive from the restaurant, I noticed everything was cold.  French fries tasted stale, the chicken pasta was hardened as well as the cheese fries, mac and cheese was not even at room temp, and the beans tasted cold.  Overall, my family and I were fairly disappointed.  I spent over $60 and not what we expected.  I don't recommend their To Go option.  I would try their dine in option next time...at least we can send it back."}
{"text":"I've had way too much Chili's in my life. I keep coming back though, because my husband really likes Chili's. *sigh* The Chili's located off the Decatur and 215 is our most frequented Chili's seeing that it's closest to home. I'm a fan of the improvements Chili's has been making - they've really been stepping up their game. The restaurant here has been remodeled and looks more trendy, the presentation of the food has also been upgraded, a rewards system has been introduced, and a tablet at each table allows diners to order drinks and desserts and even pay their check. Chili's used to email coupons out like crazy but has ceased the coupon disbursement ever since the rewards system was launched. :(   I pretty much get the same thing every time I come to Chili's. You guessed it, it's the black bean vegetarian burger! I get the Guacamole burger and customize the hell out of it, i. e., annoy the shit of our waitress. The fries are always awesome at Chili's. Dessert is meh.  Service is mostly good here and we always eat in the bar area at a booth.  PRO TIP: Come on Sundays for all day Happy Hour and eat in the bar to get FREE chips and salsa!   Worth a Return Visit? It's inevitable. My guy loves Chili's.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #142"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. We asked another server for help and got blown off. Shortly after, the wrong  drinks were sent to the table."}
{"text":"Happy Hour apps in the bar ALL DAY SUNDAY--- lots of full size choices for $3, $4, and $5.  Food was quick.  Ability to pay the bill on the tablet at the table was a really convenient feature.  Service was friendly and kept drinks refilled."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Chili's in years, mainly due to my dietary restrictions. Went today with a group of coworkers and I was pleased with the visit. We started off with chips and salsa. The chips are homemade and they were quite tasty as was the salsa. For lunch I ordered the salmon with rice and broccoli. It was pretty good. No one got dessert as we were all stuffed. Service was attentive. Our server was on top of our every request."}
{"text":"Getting any food to-go from chili's is a waste of time. It would be nice if they switched their togo containers from styrofoam to aluminum or something that holds in the heat. It doesn't matter what time I pick up my togo or how quickly I eat it, it is always lower than room temperature. Especially the margarita chicken. It's practically ice cold. And they ALWAYS forget honey mustard. Which wouldn't be annoying except we get charged for it but it's not worth getting back in the car just to pick that up. Extreme disappointment."}
{"text":"We came here for Chicken Fajitas one night when we couldn't figure out what to eat , wanted to stay on the Strip and didn't want to spend $100's.  Our waitress was very friendly and quick.  Food is your basic Chili's.   I guess more of a happy hour drink spot, but it is what it is."}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience at this Chili's. The service was slow, the restaurant was dirty, and the food was okay to say the least. Our server was weak and didn't check on us after we got our food. Our drinks needed to be refill but she was never to refill it. I will never visit this Chili's again."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here last night. We were seated promptly and our server took our order right away. We each had the baby back ribs. Both our orders were burned and the server never came back to check on us. It was the manager who finally came over and we sent our ribs back and he did refill our drinks. Not a very good experience."}
{"text":"We went back to Chili's for a third time for their Ribeye Steak special and mashed potatoes.  Awesome!!!  This is the Chili's located in the Outlet Mall Shopping Center - South End of the LV Strip, next door to I-HOP.  We *really* like MINDY our server!  Second time we've had her and I recommend you ASK for Mindy if you go to this Chili's!  She is *always* on her \"A\" game and friendly and stays on top of things!  It's nice to go to a restaurant and even though it's been a couple months since you were there last....you see the server is *still* there making people smile and hustling her \"you know what\" off to provide exceptional customer service.  GREAT JOB MINDY!!!  I hope your Manager see's this YELP review and you get some well deserved recognition! Keep up the awesome job!   :-)   James Roth II"}
{"text":"The greater who sat out table was not friendly at all. Was alot more welcoming to the white family in front of us. Our server was on top of it. Our drinks were never empty. She was very friendly. Our food was okeay but our fries were cold when they came out and waited quite a while for our food to come out for an empty restaurant. When we told the waiter that they were cold she offered to bring new ones out. But by the time we got them we are already full from a mill. I like chili but we will not  be coming back"}
{"text":"My friend and I came out for a girls night on Friday around 7pm. We stat our self in the bar \"self seat\". Took about 5min for use to be greeted by our server. He wasint rude, but wasint exactly friendly either. We asked for suggestions on drinks he had none to offer. When asking about certain drinks the only answered he had to offer was I don't know I don't like that type of drink. Didint really have any suggestions about the menus either. My friend went with one of there penne pasta. She though it was okeay. I went with the unlimited chips salsa soup and salad. For the soup I ordered the chicken enchilada it was absolutely delicious I actually had two bowls. The fresca saled was just as equally as yummy but I would recommend having some vegetables on it not just cheese and. I finished the salsa pretty quick I asked my server for another salsa and it never came. I also asked for another Margarita and that never came out as well. The last soup I ordered was the potato,.... yuck bad choices. How are sold dining experience we probably won't install or server on other servers. For example I never got silverware. Our check was all messed up so we asked them to split it. When are check came out it definitely was not split. We had to track down another server to do it for us. When waiting for a check it took over 20 minutes this is absolutely ridiculous. Upon leaving the restaurant I need Italy got sick to my stomach and started puking in their parking lot. I'm pretty sure it was food poisoning from that potato soup because something was very very off about it. So basically I just paid $20 to pick up my home now very very disappointed in the quality of food and your lack of service. . I love Chili's in iDine here often I'm really disappointed that you guys were up to par. If I do decide to come back I definitely won't sit in the bar maybe then the service will be adequate and more attentive."}
{"text":"Shameeka was great! She went above and beyond to answer all my questions and make sure I was take care. The service was fast and friendly! I ordered Togo for a lunch special. Just a double burger and salad! It makes such a difference when you get happy employees!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely terrible ribs tasted like they were frozen and then reheated also had the Cajun chicken pasta tasted like kraft Mac and cheese with some dry chicken on top we will not be back to this one"}
{"text":"Food is fine (Chilis is Chilis) and service when sitting in the restaurant to dine-in has never been a problem. It's the takeout I have had issues with. For some reason this Chilis will not accept phone orders within a half hour of closing. I once called at 9:32 (they close at 10) and was told I could not place an order. I had just gotten out of work and wanted to pick up food on my way home. I was told I was more than welcome to come in person and order food to go. I explained I wouldn't get there until 9:50 and again was told that was my only option. So I drove there and had to place an order and sit and wait for it. I watched a guy come in and sit down at the bar and order food (to stay and eat there) at 9:59 but apparently me calling in an order at 9:32 was not acceptable. No where on their website does it state this \"rule\" about when you can place to go orders so I'm not sure how that is good business. I was so annoyed and probably will order from the Applebees across the street next time instead."}
{"text":"Every once in a while you come across efficient, quality customer service. It's not so common with takeout. Now tonight 12/30  7:40 I'm doing a delivery pick up for Grub Hub and for 20 minutes I watched lady here go the extra mile with every single customer. Not Just the delivery guys but also the regular customers.   Making sure to describe how to make serve warmed up and how she separated sauces as requested. This is good old fashion watching out for the customer. By far the most efficient and courteous takeout I've seen. Kudos. Impressing takeout customers brings in more business to the restaurant. I have to come back for myself.  This gal is a keeper Chili's!"}
{"text":"Could have been better.  The server was great ( Jessica ). She was incredible.  This would have been four stars but the lack of wifi in 2016 is an automatic two star deduction.  My gas station has wifi.  McDonald's has wifi."}
{"text":"Customer service is horrendous. I ordered take out, called to see if my food was ready and asked if they would mind bringing my food out, because I have a sleeping baby and sleeping toddler in the car, I got hung up on. Called back, and a different guy said \"we can't do that.\" So I woke up both of my kids and carried a car seat in just to get take out, when I walked in, no apology just put the receipt down, said \"sign here\" and walked away. Not even a thank you.  It sure why he was mad, he's not the one carrying two sleeping babies.   I obviously don't expect some people to do that, but it's disappointing how unhelpful people are.  Help moms out people!!!!"}
{"text":"food was delicious and out in a timely manner and the service was actually very good i definitely was impressed only complaint is the prices but otherwise perfect"}
{"text":"Really disappointed from our visit last night.  We arrived and were seated immediately near the bar and the waitress was swamped.  It looked like she was managing the entire section by herself which she did well.  The real downfall of the visit was the extremely long wait for food.  The waitress brought over chips and salsa to keep us happy on the house which I was very happy about since our appetizer that we ordered took 30 minutes to arrive.(fried pickles)  The wife ordered fajitas and I ordered the new crusted sirlon.  Her fajitas came out about an hour after we arrived and I had to wait another 10 minutes for my steak.  Steak comes out well done when I ordered rare.  On the second attempt it came out perfect but it was a classic sirlon not the new ancho chili crusted(disappointment).  It also did not come with fries or the dipping sauce.  Not sure if the cook was new or what but after an hour and a half to receive my food I was not about to complain and wait any longer.  Might be time to try a new place as excited as I was to go."}
{"text":"Service was just bad, food came 40 minutes after ordering and the 2 stars are for another server trying to help and the Manager being genuinely helpful. She was very attentive offered to give my 9 month pregnant sister something while she waited. My sister declined You can just tell our oder sat for a while, fajita was not sizzling and the hamburgers bottom buns were soggy. Just a super disappointing all around experience.BUT my sister's remake food came  fast I have never been to this one but it's close to my house and I'll probably try again with football season on the way. My sister's come here often and say it's never been like this"}
{"text":"I actually had a bad to-go experience.. They sent my boyfriend home with the wrong food... I went back angrily, requesting a refund. In addition to my refund, the manager insisted on giving me my right food. I thought it was very nice of them to do that. The only thing I think Chili's could improve on is when they have a To-Go order, SHOW THE GUEST THEIR FOOD BEFORE THEY LEAVE... yikes. But still satisfied with how it ended up"}
{"text":"It was what I expected. We ordered the 10 for me special and added the toppings to fajitas as an up charge. Food was decent but the service was SLOW. Now you pay at the table on a Table-side tablet. Our waitress failed to mention that was how we pay our bill so we waited a very long time before we were informed. My lunch turned into a 2 hour ordeal. The atmosphere was nice, decor looked great but the place was dead. I would come back but only if I had more time for lunch."}
{"text":"I was sitting there over an hour. The hostess, who has the worse sense of customer service, keeps saying 20mins and then she just didn't seem to know anything. This has been a complete waste of my time. I decided to just go up the street to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Server 5 stars!!  Food ugh omg salty salty salty. Greasy chicken tenders. Broccoli tasted like the bathroom smells. Mashed potatoes just gross.  Just close all the chillis already.   Our server was the best ever."}
{"text":"This location truly underwhelms.  They always take the longest time with to go orders, literally forever! I called and they told me 20 minutes...well that turned into an hour or more.  This is the third time we've had this experience at this location, I understand weekends are busy but an hour! I ran errands and showed up 30 minutes after I called and when I arrived it still wasn't ready.  I had time to go next door and run another errand and when I returned still no food.  Do better please! This location is the worst"}
{"text":"Had the half ribs full lunch plate. Place was dead for a Wednesday. Only two servers on, so service was slow, except that my ribs came out while I was half through my salad (fries got cold) and dessert sat on the table all the time I was eating my ribs. Place needs help. No refill on drink until after dessert. No management presence. No one asked me how it was except the server. Better experience at other locations."}
{"text":"R Donovan  Patio seating and view is phenomenal!!! Excellent service and management. Our server was on point and the new burgers were fantastic!!! Manager stopped at our table, I think his name was Todd, was personable and genuinely concerned about our meal and service!  Only negative feedback I would say is the restaurant is hard to locate being on the second level."}
{"text":"The restaurant being on the second level was difficult to find! Once we got in we were greeted with a sincere welcome and asked to sit on the patio.  What a phenomenal view and atmosphere! Our server was fantastic and the manager visited our table to make sure our service and meals were great! We had the new burgers and they were phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Host Tia was very rude and unprofessional. When we arrived we were told that our party would need to wait 20 minutes to be seated then when we went to ask how much longer after waiting 25 minutes to be told very rudely and with much attitude from Tia that we would need to wait an additional 30 minutes after each group that came after us got to sit down before we had..while trying to ask her why we hadn't been seated when everyone else has she went to the back of the room and we watched her go to her manager Mia and complain about us asking why we haven't been seated yet. We waited an additional 15 minutes and the manager had not came to speak to us about the situation. We love chili's but we will never give our business again they obviously don't hire based off customer service skills."}
{"text":"Got a to go order and to find out they forgot to give honey mustard with our chicken crispers and be sour cream or salsa with the  quesadilla. Thought it would come with it."}
{"text":"Ali, our server, was by far the most personable, friendly server we've ever had the pleasure of being served by.  My boyfriend and I both work in the customer-service industry, at the managerial level, and would hire Ali on to our employee teams in a heartbeat.  Keep up the excellent service, Ali.  Your hard work and customer-first attitude will get you places.  Chili's has an immensely valuable asset on their team.  Thank you again, Ali! -Cassandra & Rob"}
{"text":"The Texas cheese fries and Margarita Grilled Chicken are my favorites here. Taste of the food here at this outlet has always been good and consistent. The staff have been polite and friendly  all the time. The location is opposite an AMC which is a big PLUS. Wish to visit this place again."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here on our way home from cleveland. The hostess's were so nice, they did mention they weren't sure what was wrong with the kitchen and why we had to wait. Our wait was only about 10 minutes, which is totally fine,  but I found it strange they said there was something wrong with the kitchen. The waitress seemed a little flustered, she said we didn't have any silverware yet because there was none prepared and she have to go prepare some, but she was very polite. My son's grilled cheese looked more like a plain cheese sandwich. I ordered the Honey-Chipotle Chicken & Waffles, which was tasty but lacked a lot of sauce so the waffles were rather dry. Overall the food was decent, service was decent, but I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This location has really turned it around. I'd had a horrible experience here when I moved back to Charlotte and stopped going to Chilis all together, but stopped by a few months ago and WOW. I've been back a few times since...but I'm still afraid to try other Chilis for fear this might be the only one to make a change. Only complaint is that they always seem to forget the fries when I do a take out order."}
{"text":"A pretty decent place that's everyone knows by now. Just leaving a tip to check in so you get the free chips and salsa."}
{"text":"You know that feeling when you walk in somewhere and you should just turn around and walk out, we should've listened ourselves!  We went to Chili's because red Robin had a long wait.  Once we set down we noticed the table next to us was dirty (not bussed from the previous guests). And it was never cleaned the entire time of our meal plus a couple other tables around us.  The place was it really even that busy.  The backsplash on our table look like someone at sneezed on three weeks previously.  The food was slow but once I got to us it tasted okay.  Because of the cleanliness of the place I didn't want to touch that little computer kiosk they put at your table.    Even if the zombie apocalypse happens and Chili's is the last restaurant in town we will not go back there ever again."}
{"text":"Ryan usually is our server! I love the chips and salsa and queso dip. It is not too expensive. There is never a wait and it is always clean."}
{"text":"Food was good we did the 2 for $20...but service was annoying.  Our waiter said that we would have her and 2 other waiters helping.  We didn't care but nobody else came over to our table and our original waitress took forever to bring us ranch and fill up my water.  My glass was completely empty I had to ask a different waiter to fill it because I was waiting like 10 minutes."}
{"text":"We live down the road and only had 1 good service experience.  Even setting at the bar its not good. Went for lunch today ordered a beer on tap about 18 min in looking around for my beer see a half glass of foam. Ok so kegs out infact waitress comes over and says the kegs out. Then i saw the mannager mia take the foam swish it like 2 diff glasses what a weird way to deal with foam right! She then tops the foamy glass off and tried to serve it . I stoped the waitress and said please miss if thats my beer i dont want it now were in about 15 min here.. waitres ask is some thing wrong i explane thats the beer she floated the keg on and she tried to save the foam and serve it to me. I just explaned no thank u ive seen it back and forth in glasses and just kind of weird shit going on up there with it.. Asked for the manager a 2nd time the manager is the lady pouring and serving the beer... as im getting up because we see her trying to pour another beer i simply stoped her said no thank you im not drinking a beer from you after you gave me trash she said no i didnt... i jave sat and watched this take place with my own eyes... then on the way out the door someone in our party said she was trying to cool the foam off a half glass of foamy beer she was determined to not pour out a half glass of beer to tight so you can imagine what dind if short cyts they are takeing with our food.. will not be back and contacting corprate"}
{"text":"I haven't been back to a Chili's in a long time and when we were given a gift card after moving to Pittsburgh we decided to use it. Their service was really nice, but their food was lacking. My husband and I shared their fajitas for 2 and were given the wrong kind of protein, we asked for pork, chicken, and beef. We were given shrimp instead of chicken so they replaced it with the chicken. The waitress let us have the shrimp, but decided to not eat them since they seemed a little under cooked. Also when our sides to the fajitas were served we noted that the beans were cold, and had to flag down the waitress to heat them up.   I will say that their pork was really good as well as their beef, their guacamole was tasty but could use more lime.   The ambiance was nice and the place was clean. But overall despite the friendly service, we were not very impressed with their food."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location in a long time and it's been completely renovated. Love the new design of the restaurant. Also, they've added the tablets that allow you to swipe your card right there at the table. Excellent improvement. Our server was very friendly, fast, and efficient. Never had to request a refill because she was on top of it from the moment we were seated."}
{"text":"This Chili's offers up some of THE worst customer service I've ever experienced. It's a chain with decent food but the service makes it such an undesirable spot.   Often times there is no one to greet us when we arrive. We waited a while tonight to be seated.   We've had issues with two meals in a row and the manager NEVER addresses the issue or attempts to correct it. On one occasion, during a lunch break, my husband ordered a burger without mustard. It came out with mustard once. When he gave it back the first time, they returned the same burger and bun with the mustard literally scraped off. The second time, it arrived with new lettuce, same bun, same burger. The third time, new bun; same burger with mustard scraped off. What's so hard to understand about \"I really don't like mustard, may I please have a new burger?\" Manager never came over, and by the time all this went down my husband had to go back to work. He was starving and the only resolution was to take the burger off the bill.   The most recent time we ordered pre-dinner salads and the meals came out without them, and also without my side. I think it was the manager who was running the food and, when we told him we ordered salads his only response was, \"Oh, do you still want them or I can take them off the bill.\"   Two stars because they have a pretty decent 2 for $20 menu that includes an appetizer and two entrees. I love the margarita grilled chicken. When we're not doing the 2 for $20 dinner, my husband loves the quesadilla explosion salad. The food is reliably good and the prices are decent but the service ruins the ENTIRE experience. I won't return for a while."}
{"text":"This is the one of those places that I crave, I go, they deliver and I'm happy until the next time I crave it.    The service is always very accommodating as I'm forever asking for substitutions, and please leave this out, and please add this, blah blah.  They have great cocktails (I love the pomegranate margarita!), excellent appetizers, and awesome entrees, many with a delicious tex-mex flare.  Also, seriously, they may have the best desserts of any of the chains.  I always leave here stuffed and remain full and satisfied for a LONG time."}
{"text":"wow what bad service, i pointed to my table not led to the table, waited 10 mins for the waitress..,after she acted like my son & i wasn't even there while other patrons recieved much friendlier/attentive service.., well maybe we were \"minorities\""}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  Used the waitlist feature and were shown to our table.  Chili's in every location is reliable.  And thanks for bringing back the southwest egg rolls."}
{"text":"The service was unmatched. The place wasn't crowded and we all know Chili's, it was a great time. I would like to say that Jandi knew what she was doing at the bar, thoroughly experienced. I had a minor complaint and Tom the manager was able to satisfy our experience with no worries. I would recommend the place to everyone."}
{"text":"I hate to give two stars but I had to. This is my 2nd time here in the last week. Today we sat at the bar and ordered the 2 for $20 deal. The bartender was quick to take our drink orders and our order. We got our appetizer in a timely manner. But when our food came out- I had a problem. Me being a server- I would never drop a plate to a customer that didn't look up to par. If I noticed something wrong with the plate I would either go back and ask the cooks to change food item or just tell the costumer that we're out of this specific item and apologize. I ordered the mango salsa tilapia. But when she placed plate in front of me- I immediately noticed my avocados were brown and black and not green. When she came back I asked if the avocados were grilled and she replied nO. So I asked well can I get new avocados. She said that she doesn't know why they were like that but all the avocados in the back were coming out like that.  I don't think they should be serving the avocados at all then. She came back out with 3 slices of avocados that looked better than what they were before so I appreciate the effort. Service was great. Drinks were filled and everything but today is was poor quality on judgement on the food. Just had to let them know!"}
{"text":"Pleasant service coupled with hot food delivered in a timely manner. I ordered steak. The restaurant accommodated my low carb choice by swapping extra broccoli for the mash.  Anna provided smiling service. And I was able to watch two games that were of interest to me."}
{"text":"Wow what happened to chilies service??? Came in at 2:00pm sat at the bar to a very unfriendly bartender. Tried to engage in conversation and she (cupcake) was not having it. When I ordered chips with our beer she gave the look like really???  How do servers with that kind of attitude make any money?  It will be awhile before we return"}
{"text":"I ordered the (new to the menu) Cajun Chicken Flat bread.  The chicken tasted exactly like Frito's Chili Cheese Corn Chips.  It didn't taste Cajun at all to me and the flavor didn't go with the Pico De Gallo.  After removing the processed chicken, it was really good.  I would order the flat bread again but next time I would go for the meatless Margherita. The service was a five star this time!"}
{"text":"Went for girlfriends birthday.  We got seated fairly quickly for a Friday night about 7pm.  The problem started right away after that.  Waited, waited, waited, ten minutes and finally had a waitress come by and say she would be right with us.  Waited, waited, watched same waitress now having conversation with another waiter then start clearing an empty table, taking the dirty dishes to the kitchen.  DONE!  We left!"}
{"text":"Slow slow slow.. The food is the same at every location.  Go here for lunch  and expect to get in an out and return to work.  Suggest everyone just say no."}
{"text":"Maybe it's too much volume for the lunch crowd...waited 35 mins for food--shrimp came out cold, pizza burnt.  Hostess while cleaning another table flung the remnant food to the ground and our table. I mean, I get it. But it was a comical trip to say the least.  We try this chilis every few years thinking it will change...and maybe it will! :/ with all that said, servers were pleasant and while hurried they were still attentive :)"}
{"text":"Waited for 45 minutes while tables sat open. When brought to the attention of the hostess she couldn't find my name and claimed a bunch of names disappeared. She was ridiculously slow in cleaning the tables and just doing her job. Our waitress was good considering she had to deal with upset customers (we never hold issues like this against wait staff). Management was no where to be found. The only reason we stayed is because it was a fundraiser for our daughter's school."}
{"text":"Wish you could give zero stars. Walked in to 4 tables on bar side dirty. Stood waiting for 12 minutes before acknowledge. Then was told wait was going to be 20-30 minutes. Several seats not used and no one cleaning tables. Remember now why I don't come here."}
{"text":"Nothing special about our experience to be honest. Waited 10 minutes to be seated, my date ordered a vegetarian dish and they had to remake it because they found traces of bacon (which they told us on there own) the manager walked up to apologize and let us know why his food was taking so long to order. I had a salad and a glass of wine lol I was disappointed because they didnt offer any discount as a good will gesture or a dessert item or something. Im also not a problem starter so I wasnt going to bring it up or argue with anyone about it. It would have been a nice, above and beyond customer service act which would have gotten them 4 or 5 stars despite the issues we had but unfortunately Im going to have to stick with my 3 stars."}
{"text":"What is wrong with the picture that 1/2 the place is not open to seating. You have tables in the other 1/2 and we have a 10 minute wait????"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. The Kitchen was a mess gross. The floors cluttered with a chips food.  My burger was so greasy not well done.  The Servers dropped food on the floor in their work stations never picked it up. They were fighting over tables. The Hostess had her zipper of her pants open looked like she rolled out of bed.  Disgusting will never be back.  Have been sick since we ate at Chili's today.."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at this location and it will probably be my last.  I wasn't impressed at all with the food or the service.  Right after my daughter and I were seated and given our menus, our waiter came over to take our drink order....Can I look at the menu first? The waiter walked away for a few seconds and returned to our table to take our order, she literally stood over me as I looked over the menu. She did the same thing when it was time to order our food. I was annoyed! Our food finally arrived and it wasn't that great. I ordered the Chipotle Fresh Mex Bowl....I've had better! I guess I was comparing it to Chipotle.  I should have known something was wrong because I had a hard time deciding on what to order from the menu.  At least the Strawberry Lemonade was delicious!"}
{"text":"Awful service, they will not allow you to sit at the bar to wait for a table. Never in my life have I heard such a crazy rule."}
{"text":"Just picked up nachos to go.  They were way over \"cooked\".   The chips were almost burnt.   Next time, if there is one, I'll check my food before I leave.  Who wants to drive back to the restaurant when you have an issue."}
{"text":"Good food. Bad service. Do not appreciate having food brought to my table by some kid wearing a sweatshirt with the hood up over his head and earbuds in his ears. Professionalism has to start somewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent service, but the food wasn't terrific. My friend and I selected the 2 for $20 special. Pretty good deal for an appetizer and an entree. However you both must select the same appetizer. There is a good selection. I was talked into onion rings. They were ok. I just don't really like fried food. Next time will be my choice.You could pick your own entree. I ordered the steak. It was delicious and cooked just like I ordered. Came with al dente broccoli and mashed potatoes. Potatoes were like glue but our very nice waiter took them back and replaced them immediately with yummy fries. My friend ordered the quesadillas that she has had before and loved them. They looked delicious. She had a huge plate full with enough for another meal.  All in all this is a nice clean place. The menu is huge so I will be back to try something else."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a 2 star rating, one is for my stupidity of expecting something from a chain.   I sat at the empty bar hoping to be in and out.. Wrong. I kept seeing the bartender texting while trying to hide from her boss, hide it from the customer too.  I drank my water immediately, I should have savored it because she never refilled it.  I ate a small portion of my meal and had to ask for the check, she never asked if it was ok or not.. Very mediocre but come on how can you not make a decent soft taco?  Next time I'll definitely eat at nordstrom cafe.. Sad you get better food and service at a store!"}
{"text":"Had a less than great experience last night.  Was told there would be two servers - only had one and he appeared new.  He was attentive, quick with refills, and made great food suggestions.  The only awareness we had of his \"partner\" server was hearing her rattle off a list of his duties before he could go home.  Chips and salsa were excellent, drinks were great.  I ordered the long time favorite Chicken Crispers.  Even the name says \"Crisp\", right?  I got soggy, rubber chicken pieces.  This is where the server lost me.  When I brought this his attention, he said they are tempura batter and thats how they are supposed to be.  Okay, so the tens years I have been having delicious, crispy, fresh chicken - those times it was all made wrong.  My bad!  Would have shared this with management but no one was around at all!"}
{"text":"I eat at many Chili's while traveling on business across the country.   By far this is the worse Chili's I've ever had the misfortune to eat at.  Not only because of today's visit but based on past visits as well.  I don't expect great service when going to places like this but I do expect at least a minimal amount.  On today's visit the food was so so.  When my fajitas came out they did not provide the shells and sides.   I waited five minutes and had to remind the staff before I got those.   Because I got the 2x fajitas, I later asked for more shells.   The server said she was on it but in reality probably forgot the second she left my table.   They never came.    I'll not be coming back to this place.  From piss poor service to uncooked burgers the risk is too high.   I was taken for $45 and shutter to think of the great food I could have made at home with that money!"}
{"text":"Service needs improvement and it's extremely noisy but willing to put up with it because the ribs are the best. Just be prepared for the sensory overload."}
{"text":"My friend and I had lunch here for his birthday. We got the 20$ special, and they charged 46$. We had a beer each. Who knew 2 beers were so expensive. so, not fun getting robbed, we would have left a great tip anyways, but since they felt they had to steal it, I don't think either one of us would be back at this loc. Anyways even if they were giving meals away, but who knows. Nahhh, probably not. The food was hot though, and tasty. Had to wait forever for wait staff."}
{"text":"Bleh. This is one of the worst Chili's experiences I've had and it was just super bleh. Nothing terrible. Service wasn't awful, food wasn't awful, but just so mediocre. I would definitely drive to a different location, won't go back to this one again."}
{"text":"I really was not too thrilled about this place. The new remodeling looked nice. Food was typical chain restaurant microwave quality. Had the pretzel appetizer and it was pretty bad; the cheese sauce was on par with the two week old sauce you see at 7-11. When we entered there was no one at the host stand. We waited approximately 7 minutes before anyone even came to seat us. In fact we almost walked out. Wait staff understaffed. Also its on LVB so they have tourist prices."}
{"text":"They don't put the price on their drinks and the margarita was 15 dollars. Service was slow, food was okay."}
{"text":"We had a big lunch and just wanted some appetizers.  I think the menu got a little longer since last time I went to Chili's.  It was a cold night so everyone ordered the Chicken Enchilada Soup.  This soup way too salty for my taste.  Apps were the typical bar food.  The service was really lacking that night.  There are so many nicer restaurants around this area.  I usually enjoy Chili's restaurant, but this one was at the bottom of my list."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed in the turn Chili's has taken lately. We used to come here pretty regularly but the last two times I have eaten here have put me off the place probably forever.  The last time I was here my date ordered something that came with sour cream and I ordered boneless buffalo wings. In his sour cream and in my wings we found pickles, and my wings had shredded cheese on them (almost like they had been taken from a different plate...). I decided to give them a second chance tonight with my dad and my daughter. He and I ordered a triple dipper with burgers, boneless wings, and egg rolls, and we ordered chicken crispers for my daughter. When the waitress brought our food she forgot plates which was no big deal as she brought one for my dad quickly and I just ate over the tray. However my daughter's chicken tenders were soggy and slimy with grease, and our buffalo wings were in a similar state. We sent back my daughters chicken, but we were told they are always like that, which is both disturbing and gross! The new tenders she was brought out were better, and we enjoyed most of our triple dipper so we ordered dessert. The skillet cookie we ordered took over 25 minutes to come out. Our waitress was nice enough to take it off the bill without being asked, and I don't believe that any of the issues tonight were her fault. Unfortunately two nights of bad food are enough for me to find a different place to frequent."}
{"text":"Don't touch the Ziosk !!!!  You will be charged$1.99 for everything you do.  Our waitress got it taken off but very disappointed we had to go through the process.  Food was good, service was good,  Ziosk was bad!"}
{"text":"I've always liked Chili's for the most part.  They have one hell of a menu - lots of variety.  Something for everyone I think.  Service is usually decent.  The place is kept clean and they are good at engaging you when you walk in.  They have made things right when things were wrong without issue a few times so I appreciate that.   So here is the good news - pretty good burgers (not a bad one yet) and the deserts are great that I've had (the molten chocolate cake and the skillet chocolate chip cookie are my recommends).  The chips (freshly made) and salsa has always been a great starter.   I've been to this location a lot over the years; proximity plays a part in that.  Downside - we have had a really nasty steak, bad bad ribs and the Fajitas have been hit or miss (especially when you order it with the steak).  So I won't even order them anymore here.  My friend calls their chicken, Chili's chicken - and that's not exactly a good thing, as my last experience I understood what she meant.  Sorry Chili's - Just my experience.  I'm game for chips/salsa, a bacon burger and desert here!"}
{"text":"love Chili's!!! The staff is great.  We go there almost once a week.  They do have a military discount (10 or 15%).  The staff is quick and I have not had a bad experience.  Sometimes there is a crowd on the weekends so there may be a wait, but if everyone is over 21 the booths in the bar (and the bar itself) are first come first serve, so you can wait for a table to finish then hop in.  We usually sit in the bar.  Great for lunch or dinner!!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty food, but the pricing can be a little too much sometimes.  The service at the location is fair and the restaurant is one I'll be returning to in the near future."}
{"text":"I had been craving chilis for awhile. Came here and they took great care of us! Sundays have happy hour all day! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Food was really good. but most of all our server Erica was amazing.  attentive and courteous.  she made out lunch amazing.  the food was fresh and delicious. again outstanding service that was really appreciated.  thank you. we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Good food & service for the price range. Recommend to go on Sundays for their bar specials."}
{"text":"Well to start, it's Chili's, you know what they serve up. I've been to this location on several occasion and have always left satisfied. The greeting, service & food have always been what you should expect from this chain. Pretty good happy hour specials as well! Cheers!"}
{"text":"This Chili's is always very helpful and provides great customer care! I was organizing an event at work and needed to have food brought in. The manager really took the time to make sure that I had a great experience and was very patient as I chose what I would like to have. I even needed it brought to the office and we are right around the corner; they offered to bring it by! The food was a hit with the attendees and we will certainly be ordering from them again for our next event!"}
{"text":"Update:  I called the establishment yesterday thinking a Yelp review without even talking to somebody in charge (other than the floor manager who offered me a bowl of soup as compensation) was warranted.  The phone call did not go well.  The manager (or someone who stated they were the manager) stated to me the restaurant was very busy that day (?? I saw maybe 10 tables with customers) and my lunch was very complicated to prepare.  (Grilled Chipotle Shrimp salad?)  I stated the manager offered me a bowl of soup to compensate and I was told that was customary as Chili's was not at fault for this situation.    I actually felt bad for leaving the server a bad tip over this but no more.  Uh yep..... again... NEVER going to this place again.  Good luck with their future."}
{"text":"Lucky me Chillies has a new happy hour menu. $3 domestic draft Sundays and Monday bar only. Yay! And the coldest bar in town. Yeah that's frost under the glass!"}
{"text":"Ok that's twice!!!!! We go inside and wait for about 5-10 minutes and NO host/hostess in site. So done with this specific location!!!!!!! Stay away from here there is NO customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was good and we were seated and served quickly. The food was as expected. They have changed the menu since the last time I was there. There are a lot of fancy things to eat. I was hoping for a simple grilled chicken salad which is no longer on the menu. Good selection and overall would return for a simple lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped on for dinner after a long day of outlet shopping with my fiancée.  We both ordered ices tea, I had the blackberry, fiancée had the mango. They were both very good. For a appetizer we had chips, salsa and guacamole. It was all good. For dinner I had the BBQ chicken enchiladas with been chillis, my fiancée had the chicken enchiladas with sour cream. Both entree came with black beans and rice. The food was served nice and hot. Everything tastes great, portions were nice, service was ok. I say ok because we were never offered drink refills. Other than that, it was fine. One more small criticism, the place could use a little cleaning (especially the front door windows)."}
{"text":"I tend to support local businesses more, but frequent Chili's because I enjoy the food and have friends who work at Chili's.  The food has been pretty much consistent throughout the years.  Unfortunately, this location must have been the worst Chili's experience ever.  The bartender and the guy working in the bar area were unfriendly and impersonable.  It was a busy night, I understand that.  But the energy at this restaurant was strange, almost unfriendly...uncaring.  As if the staff didn't like each other.  I'm not sure if you're trying to promote an unfriendly sports bar atmosphere that only caters to men with snooty servers, or if you just missed the target on what a friendly family restaurant should be.  Both bartender and waiter lacked enthusiasm and personality.  I noticed only one regular at the bar, if that.  I can understand why.  Generally, there are regulars all the time at other Chili's locations and their bartenders actually interact with their customers.  The other staff members know the customers as well.  The staff interact with each other and seem to enjoy working at Chili's.  No, not this place.  Not this bartender.  I guess his name was Cory, according to the receipt.  I wouldn't know for sure because he never actually said hi to me or introduced himself.  It took about 15 mins for the manager to bring out queso.  15 mins.  I wasn't drinking very fast, but I finished my first beer before I got the queso.  Odd.  Everything was so slow.  The another customer next to me also said the bartender was inattentive and he waited 30 mins for a refill of his soda.  I also noticed his food took awhile to come out.  At least the lack of service was consistent.  I hardly ever complete their surveys, but I made sure I did this time."}
{"text":"This might be one of the saddest Chili's I've ever been to.   Very somber mood.  I'm used to Chili's being loud and vibrant, not like this.   Its really you bad because the food was very good.  I ordered the small sirloin rare, and it was cooked perfectly! I hated the presentation of the good though.   With what I ordered, 6oz sirloin, veggies and the cheesy mashes potatoes,  I feel everything should have been one plate.   I sat at the bar and there was a decent lineup of sports on the tv's.  Just too quiet though!  The bartender,  Amber, was very good.  Friendly and made sure my steak was cooked properly.   This is the closest Chili's to my house just wish it was more exciting!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the restaurants with the worst tasting foods I've been to, and I've been to iHop. The food is either way too salty or has no flavor whatsoever. Don't even get me started with the service, don't get your hopes up that the waiter will come check on you. The only time he came was to grab our orders and he wasn't even the one to bring them. Our table packed up with plates and cups that weren't even refilled once. We got attitude when trying to grab the waiter to even get us any water as I was dying from thirst from the salty steak."}
{"text":"I haven't tried Chili's in a while, so when it was suggested, it was knowing that they have a new menu.   The last time we tried it, we were in Texas and we had burgers, they were great!   Today, we started off with an appetizer, we had the nachos, they were smothered with goodness!  Loved them.  For entree I had the grilled chicken sandwich.  This was a sesame seed bun, apple smoked bacon, chicken served with ff and honey mustard dressing.  Very tender, good flavors.  Great  sandwich."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for dinner, it had been a while since we had tried a Chili's, the last one may have been in Texas.  Today, I ordered the fajitas triple play, which included beef, chicken, and shrimp.  It was put on top of grilled onions and green peppers.  They served it with a small plate shredded cheese, sour cream, pico de gallo and guacamole.  This was disappointing because it was so little, just about a spoonful each.  When they bought out my plate, the shrimp was missing and our server said it was coming, by the time I had eaten everything else, they brought out the shrimp.  It was good, but I would have enjoyed it with my meal!  I must admit this was an \"okay\" meal, not something I would recommend, but if had no other choice, would eat it over perhaps something else."}
{"text":"I don't really eat at Chili's... But tonight we had to go and pay close attention to everything. Can't tell you why, but we had to. The place was nearly deserted on a mid-week evening around 8:30 or so. As per usual, if you've walked into one Chili's (or Applebee's, O'Charley's, Outback, Olive Garden, etc) you've walked into all of them. Nothing surprising there.  They sat us down and browsed through their menu. Shitty beer selection but I already knew that. So, I ordered water and a Sam Adams Boston Lager for Becky and I to split (since, you know, we still had kids to go back home to).  The waitress was nice and serviceable.  Their menu had the usual fare. We didn't browse a whole lot. They had some special where you get two entrees and an appetizer for $20. Of all the things available from that sub-menu that sounded appealing were the fried shrimp, which I ordered with french fries and cole slaw, and the 6-oz. sirloin, which Becky ordered with a baked potato and steamed broccoli. For the appetizer we chose the corn guacamole.  The appetizer came out pretty quickly and it was a very nice  portion I must say. It did not taste like it came from some reconstituted power and the only true complaint, as far as flavor, was that it needed cilantro. Aside form that, it was ok. Not entire sure why they called it \"corn\" guacamole as there was hardly any to speak of.  The Chips... wow.. those things are a joke and they should be ashamed to call themselves tortilla chips. Doritos have better tortilla chips than this crap. They were paper-thing and broke every time you tried to scoop some guacamole or salsa out. They didn't taste horrible... but you couldn't dip them into anything. The salsa was ok as well. Nice and roasty but no heat.  Then our entrees came. Becky got the better deal out of this fiasco. Her sirloin was nicely cooked medium-rare, her baked potato was pretty standard, topped with the usual goodies and the broccoli was nice and crunchy. Everything on her plate was pretty nice and tasted good.  I, on the other hand, got a miserable 8 shrimp on a mountain of soggy fries. They tasted ok, the shrimp did, but I was not happy with the portion I was given. 10% shrimp 85$ fries and 5% of my plate's real estate went to two ramekins with marinara sauce and sour cream. I barely touched my fries, the marinara was pretty bland and disgusting. It's kinda hard to screw up sour cream from a tub, so that was ok but overall my dinner just sucked. The cole slaw was pretty standard but pretty bland as well.  My plate was a prime example of why we don't go to chain, casual-dining places. They just suck. Definitely won't be going back to ANY Chili's unless I have to."}
{"text":"Chili's \"  what can I say.. The foods good, prices are average for grill and bar type restaurant . My wife and I enjoy sitting in the lounge area most of the time because of the fact you can just grab a high top table without waiting.  I've been going to this location for a few years now, food always good. The problem is, even when their not busy your sitting there waiting for someone to come over as much for 5 to 10 minutes.  I've seen people get up and walk on more than one occasion for lack of service.  Where's the floor mgr of this place .  The servers are friendly enough when their there but they pull more disappearing acts than Houdini.   This has been a consistent problem at this location. (bar area)  They just recently did an inside and outside makeover which really looks great and chic (New York style)  really cool!!  Ok\"  Iam being nit picky here, but they took the high top table in the far corner And  replaced it with Handicap table, although I totally agree with the need for handicap tables , I cannot understand the placement of this one.  I've seen handicap patrons trying to maneuver through the high tops trying to get to this table.  Like an obstacle course.    Wouldn't it make more sense to locate this table to the entrance of the lounge for easier access for the handicap, for safety reasons?"}
{"text":"My 6yr old daughter loves this place. The molten lava desert and the tablet like device on the table where u can plays games. This is a good family restaurant. Today my wife found a hair in our food. My head is shaved, the wife's is long and black and my daughter's is longer and brown so it wasn't ours. I have a very weak stomach for hair in my food. I sent the appetizer with the hair in it back and my plate too. I had only eaten one bite thank god. I did have to suffer thru the dinner and my daughter eating desert, I forced myself to eat a bite of ice cream cause my daughter really wanted me to. They had the audacity to charge me for my entree even though I had only one bite of it. This will be our last trip to chiles, we can take our iPad with us and my daughter can find another favorite desert."}
{"text":"I just finished the Chicken Crispers with fries and a Caesar salad.  I honestly want to throw up.  I would have done better licking lint off the carpet.    Like a previous review noted, the Crispers are the soggiest things ever.  I am fairly certain they do soak their chicken in water because they were that wet.  Not moist and tender, but actually wet like they just got out of the swimming pool.  The fries were lukewarm and the salad was drenched.    The waitress, if anything was overly attentive and asked me what I wanted upon sitting down (please, give me five minutes to glaze over your extensive menu), and then asked me something like 3 more times (maybe 2 minute intervals) before I picked out what I thought were going to be chicken tenders.    The coating was really thick and not crispy and if you tried to pick it off it was all gummy and stuck to your fingers.  They had another version of these that were \"extra crispy\" which probably would have just been normal.  Either way, I am feeling absolutely ill and wish that I had been smart enough to check the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this place before venturing inside.  What a terrible way to start a flight..."}
{"text":"Chilis must be doing very well to ba able to turn away customers. I sat at the bar, chose what I wanted, changed my mind, took a picture of a drink my wife likes, talked to the guy next to me and never got served (~15 min). This place was not busy either. The waitress served the guy I was talking to, looked at me, AND WALKED AWAY.  As I'm collecting my things to go a waiter finally asked if I'd like a drink...not bloody likely!!  It's a shame too, I like the Chilis in the Edmonton airport."}
{"text":"Been to Chili's a handful of times and for the most part the food is always consistent which is good!  We usually get the 2 for $20 deal - me with the chicken margarita or Chicken crispers (honey chipotle) with corn/slaw or fries and the other half usually gets the classic bacon burger (it's huge)....we usually get the chips & corn grilled guacamole.  For this price it's a deal for sure!! We always are full and satisfied. One thing (varies by location) is service can be hit or miss.  This location is pretty good but stay away from the Summerlin location...horrible servers!!  Extra star for the Oreo molten lava cake with ice cream...it is absolutely delish!!!"}
{"text":"Can be a bit slow depending on when you go. Food is hit or miss and wait staff is,also hit or miss."}
{"text":"The customer service was fine but what's up with the \"grilled\" chicken? It's more like \"microwaved frozen\" chicken. BLAH! I'm trying to upload a pic I took as proof, I don't see an option. Anyway, I'm not impressed with Chili's like I was back in the day. C'mon Chili's!! GRILL the chicken if your going to call it that!"}
{"text":"WOW! Don't go here, long wait and my whole family felt ill after. The management is horrible and have no idea what customer service is! The food was less than what it should have been probably because half of it sat around while the other half was cooking! POOR MANAGEMENT and POOR food service all and all this is exactly why I dislike chain shacks that call themselves casual dining, this is slop and there is no dining about it!"}
{"text":"A smaller Chili's stuffed into the food court at Concord Mills mall, my wife, daughter, granddaughter and I stopped in for a bite to eat while out Christmas shopping. The food here is fair at best and not worth the price. I got a Buffalo chicken sandwich which was a breaded, formed chicken patty, not a grilled chicken breast, with very little bleu cheese or buffalo sauce and neither one had much flavor that I paid $8 for with a side of fries which was better than the sandwich. My wife was not informed the soup she ordered they were out of until she ordered even though it was still on the menu. She settle for a grilled chicken salad which said was just ok. My granddaughters mac and cheese looked like, and according to my daughter, tasted like a 50 cent box of Kraft mac and cheese from the grocery store and they charged $5 for that with a vegetable side! My daughter said her chicken enchilada soup was good, but a small bowl of soup with a small side salad was $8. . It was not that busy for us to have to wait over 30 minutes for our food and service was just ok. The wait, food quality and service was no where near worth the $38 we paid. If you choose any other place in the food court to eat, you would come out better than eating here."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner: baby back ribs (always great), fajitas (sizzling good), & fish tacos (family favorite). Nate was an attentive & kind server."}
{"text":"It's tradition of my bestfriend and I to go here once of month. The food varies, it's ether a hit or miss sometimes. Hands down you have to always get the South Western Eggrolls. The staff is always pleasant and the bar area has these sweet legit arcade game tablet that also acts like the bill for fast and convenient paying."}
{"text":"I went on my lunch break with a few coworkers, when we walked in we were left standing at the hostess station for about 3 minutes with no one acknowledging us. One of my coworkers went and ask the bartender should we seat ourselves, she said no and came over a few minutes later to seat us. Our waiter Keith came by to take our drink order, in an attempt to avoid rushing I explained we were on an hour break and wanted to make sure the kitchen would be able to accommodate our time restraints. I requested to place my food order along with my drink order. Keith seemed annoyed, and made it uncomfortable at first. Anyway the food arrived really fast, and was decent. We were able to dine in and make it back to work with time to spare. The food was fine but I still wouldn't go back to this location, I like to spend my money where I feel welcomed. My first instinct was to leave when we were left standing at the hostess station and against my better judgment I stayed. Won't make that mistake again."}
{"text":"Ate here the other night and it was ok. Food was pretty good but the service was lacking a bit. It was 2 adults and 4 children so I know we weren't a servers ideal table but it took about 7 minutes for a server to even acknowledge that we were sitting there. Then after that it still took her a few minutes to get our drink order. I understand being busy but it literally takes 5 seconds to say hi there I'll be with you in a moment. That probably would have helped change the whole tone of the visit honestly. The server was nice once she got to us and did her job. She could have been a little more attentive but she got the job done. Oh and when dessert was brought out the appetizer was still in the middle of the table. Pre-bussing is one of my biggest pet peeves when out to eat. You can tell when a table is finished with something and if you're not then ask if they need a box for it. If they don't then they tell you that you may take it from the table.  This visit certainly won't deter me from visiting again but just wanted to give a heads up since a manager wasn't ever seen on the floor to bring to their attention."}
{"text":"Waitress never checked on me and never refilled drink. Stale tortilla chips but the standard Chili's salsa was good. Carnitas tacos came out cold, bland and hardly any meat.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Food was exceptional...not to mention the mudslide.  Amy was our bartender and did a terrific job getting our food in a timely manner. Keep up the good work Amy."}
{"text":"Came here a couple nights ago and we had a pleasant experience. No wait, was seated quickly and server was nice. Food was on point and we even had dessert, try the blondie! We even got to color a chili and they said they would put it up on the wall, haha.   Taking away one star because we had to ask twice for a to-go box. But other than that it was a good trip to Chili's. :)"}
{"text":"Went here with my daughter while visiting her from out of state.   I had eaten a late brunch while traveling,  so I had a glass of water and watched her eat.   She got the salmon,  and it looked wonderful.   She said it was!  She liked the seasoning and the fact that it was lightly crusted on the bottom.   Our server was attentive without being intrusive.   We sat outside and enjoyed a lovely breeze--and a view of the fountain.     A couple of women sat down on the deck area and were smoking.   A manager-type asked them to stop within 10 minutes or so.   I appreciated that.  There was a sign that said NO SMOKING, so either they were illiterate or they thought it didn't apply to them!"}
{"text":"Chilis is honestly one of my favorite sit down restaurants. I LOVE their Texas cheese fries, those things are to die for. Have tried several of their entrees and have never been disappointed. Staff is friendly and don't bother you too much and don't disappear for long periods of time. A great place to sit down, relax, and enjoy great food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for food while running errands. Service in the lounge was very quick, the food arrived hot (once I'd made up my mind, lol!) & tasted yummy. I had the triple appetizer plate of sliders, cheese bites & Southwestern egg rolls, while hubby had the fajita trio of steak, carnitas & shrimp. The shrimp were mildly spicy & tasted really good. My meal was beyond filling & we left stuffed. The fun part (for me, anyway) was using the Ziosk to pay the bill. Costs to play games, but, hey,  I'll take the tech where I can get it!  Will be back."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying I love Chili's.  That being said, I had an awful experience at this particular location.  First, there was a drunk guy wandering around causing a scene in there and it took a while for anyone to ask him to leave.  Mind you this was at 11:30 AM.  This would not have ruined my experience, because I know stuff happens.  Then the waiter walks up and calls us kids... I'm almost 30.  Then the real kicker was when the food finally came and my rice still had the bag on it that they re-heat it in.  This grossed me out.  I do not want to know what sort of pre-packaging my food comes in.  Then when I told the waiter, it sort of seemed like this happens all the time.  So either way, I've been back there, but not happily."}
{"text":"I went to chili's on the 4th of july we wanted to get some food before we watched fireworks we went about an hour before. a guy introduced himself and said him and another girl were going to be our servers. he took our drink order, My boyfriend ordered a margarita and I ordered iced tea he asked if I wanted lemon I said yes please. A good 5 minutes went by and a girl brought over our drinks, my tea had no lemon. She asked if we were ready to order we said yes. My boyfriend ordered a burger with bacon cooked well done, with no lettuce. & I ordered soup/salad and she told me I couldn't order that its only a daytime thing. she was very rude. So I then changed my mind to a buffalo chicken salad. she then asked my boyfriend im sorry what was your order. Really?.......  I asked for chips and salsa to come out first. So as time goes on... Never got lemon for my tea, a couple sits next to us gets there drinks in 2 minutes and there appetizer hits their table and then 10 minutes later there food hits the table. So now we had been there for at least 15-20 minutes and our chips and salsa hadn't even came out.. yet the table next to us is almost ready to leave. Every time we would ask the lady for something she was rude... short. and you could tell she was trying to avoid us. So by now I was frustrated, my boyfriend stopped the server and asked for our bill. we wanted to pay for the drinks and go. at this point we did not want to stay. she made us feel very uncomfortable. she didn't ask why... or is everything okay? she just walked away went and grabbed the bill with everything on it and then took his credit card. My boyfriend got up and found a manager and explained the situation said we don't mind paying for our drinks but we don't want the food anymore it had been 30 minutes and still no sign of chips and salsa.....  he apologized and comped everything, which was nice. but im very disappointed in Chili's, not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. Very poor service. Our waiter wasn't attentive at all. We had to ask 3 times for silverware after our meal was served. Someone else finally brought it.  The original Baby Back ribs were very dry & hardly any meat on them. We were friendly with our waiter when he would show up, he never came by to see if we needed anything or to say thank you.  We will not be returning there."}
{"text":"Horrible seating. Arrived with my group of 4. There are six open booths and the hostess refuses to seat us because \"it will back up the kitchen.\". OK, I get that. They are short staffed. However, 9 people (3 different groups) walked past the 10 people waiting for a table and walked up to the bar. Yes, they all ordered food and have their drinks in hand and good ordered. I'm still waiting for my table. Manager wouldn't come out to speak to me. Do not come here. I'm not even hungry now. Brutal."}
{"text":"Even on a very busy Friday evening we were seated fairly quickly. The waitstaff were all friendly & honest. The Texas fries appetizer came with too many jalapeños but they were easy to remove. The sirloin was done just the way I like it. The skillet potatoes were good but too much broccoli. The meal didn't come with any bread which was disappointing but the waiter did offer a slice of toast. All in all it was a pleasant meal!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and the waiters were friendly and nice. The computerized payment system was VERY difficult & did not work properly. While friendly, the waiters had to be repeatedly asked for napkins, water, chips and they brought well done steak for my friend when she ordered medium, they placed wrong entrees in front of us. The checks has to be corrected several times. There were many empty tables so not sure what was up with the waitstaff."}
{"text":"Great place to eat I enjoy the variety of menu items . Southwestern style this might be a chain but one of the pnes that I like alot. The service is always great here and not much of wait to be seated. The atmosphere is great too if you want something different try Chilis !!!"}
{"text":"It's Chili's you've been to one you've been to them all.  If you sit by the bar you get free chips and salsa.  ALSO, if you ask, they have the full calorie menu so you can see all the items and the corresponding calories. If you are trying to eat healthy.  They also have skinny girl margaritas 100 calories each."}
{"text":"Eaten here at least a half dozen times between flights.  For airport food it is good, more on the mediocre side on normal standards.  The win for this place is the service and the speed they get you fed and out the door which is nice if you have only 45 min to an hour free. My wife and I were sat, made our order and ate within 30mins.  Staff are always friendly and attentive, no complaints with this place during any meals there."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the area, always amazing food, always good service. Chips and salsa is an amazing appetizer and mango arnold palmer to drink, yes please. Can't go wrong at this Chili's. Always clean and always plenty of parking with plenty of other stores and dessert places around for after dinner."}
{"text":"For the past month we have made this a after soccer game dinner routine since my daughter's games were at 3:15PM so we are there around 4:30-4:45PM.  The staff are WONDERFUL.  We got great service from the greeter to the Waiters and their helpers and the food was delicious.  We like that it is kid-friendly with a very impressive kids menu but also has the food and drinks for the adults too.  I only gave 4 stars since three of visits were in the evening and I would have given 5 stars but this past Saturday we had an early game and the server at lunch time had no personality what-so-ever.  Luckily they had a balloon guy working the tables and that was perfect to entertain our daughter. The next two Saturday games are early so I am keeping my fingers crossed we will get a waiter with a better personality."}
{"text":"Ordered take out here last week. The food looked thrown together. I get it's take out and most people wont go back after they've left but still it looked thrown together like whoever prepared the meals didn't care what the finished product looked like. I eat at chili's a lot but never ordered take out here. The portions looked smaller than if you dined in and ordered it. I won't be ordering take out here again but i will be dining in here still. I love chili's and obviously the food but don't expect to get the best service when ordering take out."}
{"text":"First of all, I ordered a California turkey club. It came with turkey and bacon. No tomato , lettuce or avocado (despite the menu obviously stating it did) then it had regular mayo instead of the basil pesto mayonnaise. Perfect. They also told us they were waiting on fresh fries and gave us fries 5-10 minutes after we received our food. Waited a ridiculous amount of time to begin with and everyone's food kind of just sucked. There was another table who was yelling about how much the service sucked and how wrong their food was."}
{"text":"Ok so we eat here a lot. We think the quality & choice of the food is good and the food is definitely flavorful. Today the service was good, but we can't understand why they charge $1 extra for a \"premium\" side. They were out of sweet potato fries completely and their broccoli is never cooked all the way, so we needed substitutes. Anyway, the waiter didn't explain it clearly. Obviously, Chilis caters to a younger population, but we are customers, too. We don't expect too much & we don't like feeling gypped."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got a gift card for Chili's and so we went to this location; I'd never been to one before, and I got what I expected: mediocre food. I really can't say much about it, it was so forgettable. The chips were really the only thing I liked, but you have to basically arm bar the waitress for more- even though it's suppose to be endless.  I got some kind of enchilada thing... and really it was a thing, not very flavorful, not very good. The sauce was bland. Actually, everything was bland."}
{"text":"Service was great food was awful they just switched to infrared ovens so if you liked the old fried food to bad. Stay away from the shrimp tacos yuck!"}
{"text":"It was late and we had good service still. Tasty food, kind people, and Dr Pepper ribs are glorious. Guacamole was pretty darn tasty too!"}
{"text":"Chilis never fails. The food was great and the service was good. I didn't have to ask for one thing and the drinks were refilled with out asking. We went back on 7-30-16 and it was even better than before. The bar staff was amazing and food was fresh off the grill. You can't beat Chili's"}
{"text":"Ordered online for pick up, even added a $5 tip for no reason. Said ready in 30 minutes. I get there and am told they don't have any ribs to fill part of my order. I asked why didn't they call me and the woman said they tried and the number was not valid. SERIOUSLY? So I order a burger to round out my order. I live 2.3 miles away, get home and the fries were cold. This is only the 3rd time ever ordering/eating at this location since moving to the area almost 6 years ago and this b.s. is exactly why."}
{"text":"Took at 30-40 minutes to get our food after we ordered it. Service was slow. There's a reason we don't come here often, but had to use up a gift card."}
{"text":"I eat at this chili's all the time! I actually get the same stuff every single time. Cajun chicken pasta with an extra 4 ounces of chicken, extra parmesan,  green onion, tomatoes and Cajun spice all on the side. I also get the cheesecake here with extra strawberry puree on the side as well.  The cheesecake here to be honest is the best cheesecake I've had that is inexpensive as well. Im a sucker for cheesecake. Especially if its with strawberries. Its really good stuff!"}
{"text":"Cane in today around 230-4pm to have chats with my friend and co worker also in service industry.  We said CHEAT DAY..so we ordered like one of every starter.   Sara are server was so awesome, funny, speedy and we had a great time!!!!  The Dip was cold and wings very undercooked but the brownie and pretzels on point.   Thanks Sara for making a every day chain restaurant a great great meal!!!!  Even on a grey cold RAINNY Sunday."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a good experience. The wait on Saturday night was longer than expected, but we didn't mind to much. Shortly after being seated, we looked at the menus and ordered. Our waitress was nice enough and the food was great! Parking was easy to find, and restroom was clean."}
{"text":"My food tasted ok until the lady in front of me found not 1 but 2 hairs in her food. Now I'm pretty good at reading faces and she looked like she was being very honest. I was so grossed out I couldn't eat anymore! I loved our server and hate that the experience was not great. My husband's quesadilla explosion salad had chunks of chicken that looked like they weren't even grilled. Just blah blahhhh.   Oh, and for the record...I had to go to this chain because I lost a bet (Duke lost vs UNC) but I generally have enjoyed chilis in the past!"}
{"text":"We arrived, waited 10 mins at the door and were ignored by staff so we sat ourselves.  We were ordered out of the dining area and told to wait outside until we could be re-sat (as that section of the dining area was \"closed\").  There were 3 tables being used in the whole place and after waiting another 10 mins, watching 4 staff do nothing, we left. What a joke."}
{"text":"So it's been a while since I've been to this particular chain the last being in New Jersey couple years back when I was not impressed, since that time they have improved. I ordered the grilled shrimp and half a rack of Memphis styled ribs neither of which had any grill marks on them, My drink was supposed to be a tropical concoction but was so sour I could not help but pulled the sour face with each sip. The very best thing on my order that night was dessert...my larva cake rocked, I'm not saying the food wasn't tasty but there was nothing to pull me back at least not for another couple years."}
{"text":"Generally, my overall experience and food was about a 3-star outing. However, I really expected it to be terrible. I remember going to Chili's YEARS ago and just thinking it was the absolute worst ever, so this was my first visit in about 5-6 years. I was actually pleasantly surprised - the guacamole appetizer appeared to actually be made out of avocados and not of whatever Subway uses. The black bean burger was really tasty, and the fries were surprisingly good, too. I don't know if I'd choose to come here if I didn't have a giftcard (which we did for this past visit), but it was overall, a very pleasant meal!"}
{"text":"Come here for the awesome service. I Always ask for Danny the bartender. Food comes out in very satisfactory time."}
{"text":"I was staying at a nearby hotel and needed food after a long trip so I went to the first place I saw. Food was good,service was acceptable and I was able to relax and unwind. I sat at the bar with company and felt very welcomed by the bar staff. I always have phone battery issues so I was happy that the bartender happily offered to charge my phone while I ate. Overall 3-stars due to the wait and drinks."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Stood at the door for almost 15 min.  Had a manager and a waiter walk past me and my roommate without even acknowledging that we were standing there.  A simple \"hello\" and \"we'll be right with you\" goes a long way."}
{"text":"Chilis is always just Chilis no matter how you try to spin it. The food is okay, it fills your need to for some grub but never leaves you saying oh my goodness I just cant wait to come back and sit under the gigantic Chili...   Really the stars I am plopping down on this one are all because the service was great. The waiter we had was on top of the strawberry lemonade and waters at our table and this always keeps me happy when my drink is full. I received my side of Honey mustard and I did not have to ask for a bill.   I wish I had more to say, or some extravagant suspenseful story to tell but well.... the only thing spicy about this review was the pepper on my fries."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Chili's restaurant.  The welcome was friendly and seated immediately.  Food order as well as drink order was taken and delivered with a smile and efficiently.  No problems with the order and food was hot and delicious.  For a chain restaurant the service and food and drinks were exceptional.  Although it was my first time here I would most definitely return."}
{"text":"Arrived at 9:15, 45 minutes prior to closing. Greeted by someone who asked if a host has helped us yet. We had not seen anyone. About 3 minutes later, a host comes up and asked how many. We said 5. He then looked at his watch, hesitated, said we could sit in the bar area. Then he realized we had a child with us after seeing our hesitation in our faces, which our faces were more discontent that he was displaying such a problem with seating us so \"close\" to closing. He then said he had to ask his manager if it was ok to seat us in the dining room. Seriously. We walked out. Can't believe the customer service. This guy should not be the host."}
{"text":"After our team builder, we decided to come have lunch at Chili's.  While not my favorite place in the world, my meal was actually really tasty today!    I went with one of their lunch combos (M-F, 11am-4pm) which comes with a starter, and an entree for only $7.00!  I had the baked potato soup for my starter, and the Double Burger for my entree.  Here is how they were............  Baked Potato Soup-  This was tasty, but a bit skimp on the potatoes.  The other ingredients were fine though.  It was super creamy and cheesy with bacon and onions etc.  It was a good starter.  Double Burger-  This was a double cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato and mustard.  Simple and to the point, and it was gosh darn delicious!  The bun on this thing was killer!  One of the better hamburger buns I have ever tasted.  It kind of had the texture of a pretzel bun, and tasted delicious!  The patties were decent sized (I would say the burger was at least 1/3 pound) and the cheese was melted perfectly.  The lettuce and tomato gave me my veggies for the day lol, and the mustard added just enough tang.  The burger also came with a decent mound of hot and crispy french fries.  I was shocked at how much I liked this meal.  For $9.50 out the door with tip?  Shoot!  Sign me up again!  Our server was on point (refills on drinks were prompt, she split everything into separate checks, and was pretty friendly, too!) and the group we went with made it a very enjoyable lunch.  I don't ever crave Chili's, but if/when we come back, I would definitely order this exact same thing again.  It was good!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.  I'm usually not the biggest fan of chain type places like Chili's, Applebees, Olive Garden etc, but I was pleasantly surprised by the lunch we had here the other day.  We had a gift card and some free kids meal coupons to burn, so we decided to stop here and check it out (we hadn't been here since moving to Surprise 3 years ago).    Food wise, we went with their 2 for $22.00 deal.  I got the half rack of ribs with fries, and my wife got their bacon burger.  My son had the chicken strips kids meal and we ordered my daughter a chicken pasta dish (She is only one, and has like 4 teeth, but she is a fucking garbage can...she will eat anything and can put the food away!).  We got chips and salsa for the appetizer that was included in the 2 for $22.00.    The chips and salsa were very good!  Their chips are so thin!  You can mow down a grip of them!  Everyone enjoyed them and we wound up getting a refill of them.  As far as the main meals, my son loved his chicken strips (I even snuck a bite and they were delicious!), my daughter housed her pasta dish, and my wife liked her burger.  My wife is a \"well done\" type of person and the burger came out medium/well.  Not a total buzzkill, but she only ate half of it and gave me the other half.  It was a damn tasty burger!  Would definitely get it again.  As far as my meal, the ribs were decent.  They were a bit dry (even with the sauce), but tasted alright.  I really liked the fries that came with them.  It was a pretty solid meal.  I liked it more than I thought I would have.  Sounds like a great meal and everyone enjoyed their food, right?  Why only 3.5 stars?  A couple of things.  Our waitress, while nice, was a bit out of it.  She dropped off drinks with no straws, was a bit slow to check on us, and disappeared for quite awhile during our meal.  She was nice and all, I think just overwhelmed with other tables or something.  They have tablets on the tables with games and videos and such.  My son was playing with it to keep himself busy.  When the check came, there was a charge for \"In table entertainment\" $1.99.  Not a big deal, as $1.99 is well worth keeping a 3 year old busy for an hour, but I never saw anything on the home page of these tablets that stated there was a charge for anything.  They should be very clear on something like that and maybe even make you put in your credit card to utilize those features instead of just tacking it on the bill where someone could easily miss it and/or not know what it was.  I probably could have talked with the manager to get it removed, but it wasn't that big of a deal.  Small potatoes in a big field, but it still was a little bit \"sneaky\".    Would I come back?  Yes!  With the gift card and free kids meals, our bill came out to only $10.00 including tip.  Money well spent for a tasty meal out with the family."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Chili's in years. In comparison to Apple Bee's the decor and looks of the interior of the restaurant are more updated. The place seemed clean and had a good feel to it. I had a salad and it my open it was way to wet. Almost soggy to say the least. The service was fast and friendly. Overall nothing to brag home about."}
{"text":"Could have been better. Disappointed in staff. Received wet sticking menus. Needed to request extra napkins twice.food was delicious. Ladies room needed help. Enough said."}
{"text":"So, I got here and was told it would be 1.5 hours before I could be served. Seriously?? I won't be coming back to this location. Should have mentioned that there was no waiting list because they were telling everyone that it would be 1.5 hours. There were empty tables. It was strange."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what it is, but even though I go to Chili's knowing the food is mediocre, I still walk out disappointed. I ordered a steak medium rare and it came out extremely well done, and my margarita was really quite gross. I'm also not at all a fan of paying at a little computer at the table... It seems extremely tacky to have to slide my card and figure out how to run a gift card at a sit-down restaurant. I will say my server was quite friendly but I just don't know if I'll ever come back."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and the curbside to go is great for our lunch orders.  Great menu choices and combos and you are never left hungry."}
{"text":"Took 5 minutes before anyone realized I was sitting at the bar!  It was busy but a bartender in front of me was busy doing something else, certainly not asking me if I wanted anything!  When a different bartender gal came out from the back she asked and got me a beer very quick.  Cold and good, but over $6 !!!!  Damn!  I got a menu with the beer and she never came back fit my order.  I finished the beer and left!"}
{"text":"There are some many restaurants in the area, I let my friend choose.  The good of the experience.  The soup and salad meal was tasty and the right price.  They came with chips and salsa, my preggo friend adored.  The not so good: our waiter was very slow.  It took him time to come up to me and get my drink order.  It took longer to get our food.  He completely disappeared and I practically had to chase after him to get the check.    I haven't been to Chili's since they closed the one on Green Valley near Sunset (my 'hood), and now I remember why we go elsewhere."}
{"text":"2.5 for service 3 for food  The food is typical Chili's.  I honestly can't complain.  What I will mention my distaste over is the SLOOOOOOW service we received.  We arrived at just before noon.  It was not that busy and it never really got overly busy for what I  would expect would be a busy lunch rush.  Ok so we were a party of 8 at lunch time but we didn't order anything out of the ordinary, some quesadillas, a couple of burgers a few sandwiches and some salads.  We were so famished by the time we got our meals we ate quickly. Also by the time we got our checks and they processed the cards that was another PROOOOOOCESSS. We had an hour for lunch and we were more than 15 min late to our meeting next door at Bass Pro. I have been to other places like Chili's for lunch and I have been in and out within about 45 min.    If you are not in a hurry and in the area consider them but there is plenty of other places to consider near by."}
{"text":"Had a really great experience at this Chilis. The servers go above and beyond to please their customers. Love that you can order dessert at the kiosk. Also, our server Jess was the best!!"}
{"text":"this is absolute balls!! its crazy that I love Chilis yet this specific restaraunt had THE WORST service ever...Not because we waited a long while, Not that the waitress wasn't a sweety, Not that the food & drinks weren't good BUT because my friend's water glass had brown stains on the inside after she'd already been drinking it, they also brought out the entree & appetizers came out at the same time OH and those plates were dirty as well. the worst part however was another friend dinning with us had lukewarm food with a side of hair YES I said hair in her food........ NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"So we came in at 9pm and stood by the hostess stand for 5 minutes without getting greeted. So then we went and sat ourselves at a bar booth.  Waited another 10 minutes for someone to come to the table...  no one did. We just had to get up and walk out."}
{"text":"This place is very consistent ... Consistently terrible service that is ! They are never that busy as on Saturdays when we go there it's about 330-4pm before actual dinner time . Cherish your first drink because if you are able to Get a refill it's definitely going to take awhile to get . Ask for something such as extra dressing and if you see it before your meal is over , consider it a WIN . Their food is usually good . I would suggest using bite squad and having it delivered . Not worth the aggravation of going there , paying $72 for a meal and leaving irritated ."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Chili's in years and now I know why. The food was ok, but I was treated pretty badly and I just had a to go order. The girl who was \"manning\" the to go orders was extremely condescending. I had an e gift card and when presented to her. She stated that she needs to speak with her manager. She also proceeded to move my food away from me as if I was going to steal it! Wth??? I have $10 to pay for that sandwich..I assure you! I'm sorry if you are not familiar with an e gift card! Just the lack of professionalism and treating me like a criminal makes me not want to come back to this place! Wow! I tend to not go to chain restaurants because of this reason. They wonder why they are losing business. This is why! Hire a nicer staff!!!"}
{"text":"There was a wait while the host cleared tables so he could seat other guests. Many uncleared tables. When he seated us, I asked the host if their bussers did not show up. He said there are no bussers. the servers are expected to clear the tables. Not sure how they're supposed to get it all done. They need more employees. Nachos were not hot. Were lukewarm. Place did not seem very clean."}
{"text":"So.....I came here on Veteran's Day for the free meal.....I had never been to a Chili's before, and after taking a look at the menu, I decided to get the lunch combo which comes with either a soup or salad and the item. The server recommended the enchilada soup and it is both a good and bad thing he did. Good because it was very, bad because now I know how good it is and will want to come here everyday for the soup. The combo I decided on was the bacon chicken ranch quesadilla. It was pretty good.... to be honest I could only eat half of it because the soup was very filling.... I could totally just eat a couple bowls of the soup. Overall, the service was great, and I will most likely be coming back here."}
{"text":"I don't usually seek out chain Restaurants but with a $25 dollar gift card suddenly the idea struck a chord.  I also heard that there have been some positive changes made to encourage more folks to give it revisit. Well from what I gather the menu shortened with better food choices that appeal to \"the foodie generation\".  They have more burger specialties, more Mexican additions.  I think they hit the mark.  We had chicken and shrimp fajitas rice and beans.  It was presented very traditional with sizzling pan presented beautifully,.  Chicken and shrimp were tender, seared with the usual compliments of peppers and onions.  The rice was one of the tastiest I have had and the beans were the black ones with a hint of spice.  Very good.  Chips are thin and very good, salsa so so.  All in all I commend them for the changes and bringing Chili's up a notch."}
{"text":"I've always had a hard time at Chili's. The menu just wasn't my jam and I feel like everything has corn in it.  Tonight, I kept it simple and ordered the Oldtimer with Cheese.  THIS was a great burger. Everything about it was perfect. Juicy patty, well seasoned. Sturdy bun, no sogginess. But what really set it off is the pickles. OH DAMN THE PICKLES! They served slices of garlic dill pickles on the sandwich and on the side. I even snuck a few slivers of garlic on the burger. This added so much WOW factor to an already great sandwich.  The fries were excellent and I devoured the Loaded Baked Potato soup. I also felt like it was a good value. Burger, drink, soup, tip... around $15. Our server was nice. Polite, engaged with my 3 yr old niece who was intent on ordering her own food. Quick service, great with refills. Friendly and patient.   I'll be back, if not for anything else but those pickles."}
{"text":"I seem to be let down every time I make an attempt to go. I ordered he bacon burger and I feel like I could have got the same thing for half the price at a Wendy's. We sat for about 5 minutes just looking at our food because we were not given silverware or napkins. It's not quite summertime here in AZ yet the AC was blasting and it was freezing at 9:00 pm. The table behind us had their poor little kids in coats ."}
{"text":"There is a reason that Chili's is always busy! Decent food at low prices! I do not come here expecting cutting edge cooking techniques, good food and friendly staff is why! I cannot think of a time I had a bad meal at a Chili's, and that's saying something. Keep on keeping on Chili's!!"}
{"text":"Tonight my bf and I came back from a long day at Sam Boyd Stadium and we wanted to eat somewhere familiar so we could get in and get out then into bed. We were seated by the host... We waited 20 mins and no one came to say hi or take our drink order. I decided to get up and talk to someone about our lack of service and that person just happened to be Ryan. He wasn't our server, but he apologized and took our order right away. He brought our drinks promptly and even asked if we wanted an appetizer free of charge while we waited. Although we declined, we truly appreciated that he offered. When we were paying, we realized that he didn't charge us for our drinks! Ryan is the reason I'm rating 5 stars...talk about amazing customer service! He definitely turned our experience into a great one. Thank you, Ryan!"}
{"text":"A chain restaurant with average food those I ldo love their ribs.  The staff there was awesome!  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Damg, I should have read my previous review before I came here.  Note to self might be worth it to upgrade my cellphone so I can do apps and avoid these situations lol  Same as before took about 10 minutes to be acknowledge and another 10 before I got my tea.  Ordered the ribey (med well), skillet mashed potatoes and the brocolli (to honor GHW Bush, lol).  They steak came as ordered and hot.  I got some tepid fries but he corrected it (ended up passing on the cold stale fries) and the mashed was ok.  I did not know you could over cook brocolli it was way DRY and looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp all day.  Server never came back to check to check up on me after the mix up our the brocolli  would have been gone too.  So the service was about the same as last time.  So 2 bad visits in a row less than a year apart.  I say go eat at the Long Horn Steakhouse on the other side of the complex!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying it should be 3.5 stars. Now, Chili's is not normally my first choice when I think about eating out. However, I've been there most recently for lunch two times now and I'm impressed with their lunch menu deals. They offer great specials at lunch time that provide you a solid amount of food for an extremely reasonable price.   What's even better about Chili's now is that you can pay your tab right at your table without even flagging down your server. There's a mini tablet like device on the table for customer browsing on dishes and it allows you to pay right then and there at your own discretion.   I recommend Chili's for lunch when with a big group. They accommodate wonderfully."}
{"text":"2 weeks later no response from the corporate office was told the area manager would contact me and hasn't. Do yourself a favor there are many other places to eat in the area go to any of them!"}
{"text":"Terrible Service Terrible Food, Terrible Management. Just pathetic, 1 hour before they close they treat you as if they are already closed, Saturday at 10 pm we arrive and got cold old and dried up food, by the way they closed at 11 pm, but made sure we knew they had nothing left basically, So Now I know I have NO MONEY for them to pay for their Dried up tortillas, cold food and nasty chips and salsa. NEVER GO HERE unless you want to be disappointed, 3 times in a row, now I decided it is time to write a review. POOR MANAGER interaction as she acted as if she does not care, Server does not care and the cook cannot cook. 03/18/17 CLOSE this dive down. Get serious or get out of the community......Oh By the way I left the $20 in coupons on the table that were sent by corporate because nothing will get me back here, I could have kept the but it was not about money, it was about this dirty, nasty place who does not care, even if it was $200 I would not use it. NO WAY!!!! This place is degrading to a consumer, bad bad bad service, ignorant lost management. You should send in a spotter several times a day for a couple days, you will understand then BRINKER"}
{"text":"After going to the movies we wanted to have a little dinner and decided to go to the Chill's across the road. We had to wait longer than the hostess estimated. We had a great server and good food all around. As we were presented the bill the manager came over and made a completely unexpected discount for our  longer than usual wait. Wow how great was that. Good customer service with good food and service."}
{"text":"Went to this location on a very busy night during President's Day weekend. The server was a true professional despite the chaos. We were thirsty and he did not skimp on the delivery of fresh glasses of water and soda. We got our food promptly and there were no issues with the cooking at all (the fries were perfect!). Thanks for an awesome visit! I would definitely go back to this location again."}
{"text":"First time back in a while and the service still hasn't changed. Slow, not attentive to our table and just always makes excuses with why this and why that happened. I've been a server, you make money if u pay attention to your tables.  I wish corporate would read their reviews and do a staff overhaul, they might have more returning customers."}
{"text":"I ordered my food online and they forgot the BACON! They also forgot the condiments on the side for my side items. They also messed up on the sauce I requested.  Also, I was not satisfied with my food, baby back ribs and the chicken crispers. The food was cold. Overall, just a disappointment."}
{"text":"First time at Chili's and probably my last... The food was okay but not amazing, definitely cheap prices. The service needs a lot of work as well as their management. Messed up our order multiple times and no apologies for it... You'd think as a manager you'd want to make sure people eating at your restaurant get great customer service... (not the case here). Also waited almost 25 minutes for our first refill when multiple servers passed by our table seeing 6+ empty glasses... Not impressed what so ever with this restaurant, SMH."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for lunch since we had a gift card. It's a very mediocre restaurant with inferior food. You can tell it's very institutional.  I ordered the chicken avocado sandwich. The presentation was nice but the chicken was gross. It tasted like a big piece of mechanically pressed and processed chicken.  Yuck.  Fresh out of the freezer to the grill where I think it wasn't cooked enough. It was very chewy and the texture was awful. The restaurant was dirty and just did not appeal to me. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered take out last night... Food was hot and made to order.. The service was wonderful and the waiter that gave me extra ranch when I came back in with an Aussie accent.....So cute!! I'll be back to this location."}
{"text":"Dirty restaurant. We were all disappointed with this Chilies because some chilies are very nice and clean. And Our service was slow. Now we know why the restaurant was almost empty at 12:30"}
{"text":"K, C & I stopped by after C's last performance in Pinocchio. We chose this location because we knew the manager and we hadn't seen him in a while. We soon found out that he had been transferred to the location by Superstition Springs Mall. Funny thing is, that location was closer to where C's performance was than this one in Gilbert. Oops. But since we were already there we continued on.  Our last visit to a Chili's, about a week ago at the one in Mesa Riverview, was just passable at best. We were certainly hoping for a better all-around experience, and we got one. We were seated right away as we arrived closer to 10pm on a Saturday night. Our host was pleasant, explained the Ziosk machine and told us our server would be with us shortly. Our server was Matthew. He was great. Matt took our drink and appetizer order and we perused the menu to decide on what else to order.   We started with the Guacamole and chips ($5.29). I think for the money, this is really a superior appetizer. The chips and guacamole are usually very tasty however on this occasion, the guacamole seemed old. It wasn't the beautiful vibrant green it is normally. The flavor was fine but the appearance was a bit lacking. This app also comes with a side of salsa so those who don't like avocado can still enjoy some chips and salsa.  Since we were informed last week at the Mesa Chili's that they no longer had the grilled chicken breast on the kids menu, C ordered the Cheesy Burger Bites ($5.29). These little sliders were nicely seasoned and cooked to medium although the little buns were a bit over toasted. C ordered the corn kernels as his side and it was nice to see the ramekin filled to the top. Winner winner kid's slider dinner.  K ordered the Soup and House Salad combo ($6.49). She got a nice bowl of Tortilla soup. Other than the overkill pile of tortilla strips on top, she said the soup was hot, seasoned nicely and was quite flavorful. The house salad was fresh with shredded cheese, sliced tomatoes, a couple of croutons, red onion rings and cucumber slices. No complaints from K.  I ordered the Sante Fe Chicken Salad ($10.19). I think this salad has changed a bit over the years but currently it's lettuce topped with tortilla strips, grilled seasoned chicken, pico de gallo and cilantro. The chicken was not overcooked and the lettuce was fresh. Overall, not bad but certainly could use a bit more ooomph, like shredded cheese, drained black beans or even some Hatch green chili's. It is called the \"Sante Fe\" after all!  Great service, so so Guacamole app, good kids meal, great soup & salad combo, average chicken salad. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"As I've previously said, we usually come to this location instead of the one by Chandler Mall but I think after this visit, we'll give our Chandler Mall location another try. K & I, C and Grandma C decided to hit up Chili's for dinner. Our server was Vincent. I liked Vincent. He came across as an old school server. He knew his stuff, was pleasant, stopped by our table when needed, was never intrusive and was on his game. Nice job.  Now, I would like to point out that I don't put much star value on the service at any restaurant, maybe one star. Why? Because if I go someplace and have awesome food but crappy service I can always go back and ask for a different server. I'm there for the food. Yes, service IS part of the whole experience. But since there's 5 stars to hand out I'm not going to waste more than a star on a variable that I can change the next time I'm there. So, I'll step off my soapbox now. When C ordered his usual Grilled Chicken off the kids menu, Vincent explained that they had a new kids menu and the grilled Chicken was no longer available. We checked out the \"New\" Kids menu and C decided on the Kids Grilled Dippers ($5.19). Basically Chicken strips, or the old grilled chicken but cut into strips. The chicken was a bit overdone which made it a tad dry. C got the usual side of Corn Kernels which this time they barely filled the ramekin half full. No bueno. K & I did the 2 for $20 deal. We both got Fajitas. Mine were all pork and K's were half pork half chicken. Both sizzling plates were not sizzling very much and honestly, they were both mostly a plate full of sautéed sliced green bell peppers and onions with a little pile of meat on top. Not a very good presentation and not worth the $10 each plate cost. They also stopped using the metal condiment tower that in the past came with the fajitas. 9 or so little metal ramekins filled with the condiments for your fajitas. Not no more. Now the sides are brought out with the tortillas in larger ramekins but there are fewer of them. Bummer. Grandma C got the Crispy Crispers ($10.19) with fries. She said they were as good as they have been in the past, no complaints from her. Grandma C & K both got flavored tea ($2.69 ea.) and C got Strawberry Lemonade ($2.89). Good server, overcooked chicken strips, lousy side portion of kernels, $20 for basically two plates of sautéed bell peppers & onions. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"K, C and I stopped in on a Thursday night, about 7. We got sat right away. The dining room was pretty busy but it was clean. Our server was Judi. She was awesome. In fact, K and I commented and told the female manager that the entire experience was great. What ever she and her management crew were doing was working, at least from our perspective.   K and I had one of our usual's, the two for $20. We both got Chicken and Pork Fajitas. Each order came out sizzling, had a good portion of protein vs green bell pepper slices and onions. The chicken was not over cooked, the pork was tasty and really one of the best fajita efforts we've had in awhile. You get an app with the 2 for $20 deal so we chose the chips and Guacamole. The Guac was fresh and you get a very nice portion. Winner winner 2 for $20 dinner.  C got the Big Mouth Bites ($9.69). Basically 4 sliders. C ordered them Medium and they came out pretty darn close. At least they were far from the hockey pucks we've experienced before at places that serve these mini burgers. The french fries that came with his dinner were done right, not overly salted and cooked properly. Nice.  Great experience. Great Food. Clean Facility. 5 Stars.  I want to note here that giving Chili's a 5 Star rating was very difficult. We dine at Chili's a lot. Not just this location but the one in Gilbert and Mesa. The thing is there is NOTHING that they could have done to make this experience better. Finally."}
{"text":"C rehearses for his improv troupe on Mondays. After K and I picked him up he wanted to go to Chili's. This location is on our way home so instead of driving up to the one by Chandler Fashion Center we stopped here. Big mistake.  Our server was Matthew A. Well, he was one of 3 that he told us would be helping us. I don't remember the others names BUT when a server tells you that 3 people will be taking care of you service should be phenomenal? It was far from it. It was S L O W plus we had an incident. Our entire meal took just under 2 hours. We were sat at 7:15 and we paid our bill at 9:06.  First, the food. K and C ordered the 2 for $20 deal. This deal starts out with an app and we chose the chips and Guacamole. Probably the best part of our entire meal.  K ordered the Chicken and Pork Fajitas. Her dinner came out far from sizzling and the food was floating, literally, on the skillet. It's protein, bell pepper and onion strips. Where did all this liquid come from. She sent it back.  Her replacement skillet came out super hot, sizzling, and there was a good amount of protein vs veg. No liquid either.  C ordered the Bacon Burger, medium. The patty was properly seasoned and  cooked properly as was the bacon. This was a replacement burger as I will explain below.  I ordered the 3 for me deal. You get 3 items for $10. It's a very good deal price wise. I started out with a nice little side salad. All of the items in the salad seemed fresh enough. I ordered the Pork Fajitas. My skillet did not have the liquid problem that K's did but the amount of food on the skillet was pathetic. It appeared that someone had already eaten half of the food and then brought the rest out to me. Also, mine was not sizzling either. I sent mine back as well. The replacement skillet was sizzling and the portion size appropriate. Although I do feel as though the kitchen cooked up half a batch, tossed my original order in the pan to warm up and then tossed it all back on a super hot skillet. No Bueno.   My little 3 for me deal also came with a small portion of the Molten Lava cake. I'm not a dessert eater but K and C enjoyed it.  So, why the 1 Star. When the server brought our tray of food our fajitas came separately. They were placed in front of K and I and when the server lifted the side items that came with the Fajitas off the tray, C's burger plate flew off the tray. Yep, on the floor, on me, on K. Grease, Catsup, stuff... Matthew apologized and a replacement burger as well as our replacement Fajitas were brought out as quickly as they could be. However, what was not fine was how the situation was handled. It wasn't. Now I have to pull out my restaurant consulting cap and explain something. Any time something is spilled on a guest, REGARDLESS of what it is, a manager should be brought to the table to discuss the situation with said guest. No manager came. My clothes and K's clothes had grease spots on them. And, to add insult to injury, our bill came and everything was on it. Now granted, I'm not expecting to eat for free but some sort of future use gift card or discount for our cleaning bill or to just acknowledge that Chili's and Matthew were sorry for our experience would have been a nice gesture. We did not want to spend 2 hours, on a school night, eating at Chili's nor walk away with soiled clothing. The food we ended up eating was fine, but the damage had already been done.  Lousy management and Server Training. Great Pricing on Deals. Good Food. 1 Star."}
{"text":"We just flew in and stopped at this Chili's as it was close to our hotel and based on the fact that most everything was closed. In spite of the fact that half of the restaurant was empty and full of dirty tables, the greeter told us there was nowhere to sit ... At 10pm. She was very rude. This restaurant was filthy with garbage on the floor and dirty restrooms. As I walked by the kitchen area, it was more of the same. Just disgusting.   On the positive side, our server was great and focused in spite of the fact that he had been working since 9:30am. It is clear this store is running way too lean on people. The food was reasonable. I just wonder about the conditions it was prepared in. We won't likely be back."}
{"text":"I love Chilis! This location is my favorite. They never mess up my food and with the email club I joined with them I always have a coupon. Food is always so good and a good deal."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from this location. I ordered a steak with a grilled shrimp topper. I was deathly ill for several days. That's the last time I'll ever eat at any Chili's. The waiter suggested that I order the topper, which should have sent off alarm bells. Never ever again!"}
{"text":"The staff is usually pretty tentative and kind, however the restaurant isn't being kept up nicely and cleanly. We sat at the bar and None of the hand washing sinks were used once. In fact (see photos) the sinks were full of other stuff as if they were being used for storage. Absolutely disgusting and unprofessional. I will probably not be back to this location until they start taking cleanliness seriously. The health department needs to take a look........"}
{"text":"We ordered the white queso, forgot to tell them without hair.... It was left on the bill... We will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Worst Chili's I've been too. The staff not only refused to serve me, they were also extremely rude about it. Lazy staff who did not want to clean tables to seat me, but were accommodating to those who followed."}
{"text":"I frequently visit this location with my family. The last 3 times the food was good, our servers were friendly (although not particularly chatty), and we received our orders quickly. The last 3 times, though, we've also been greeted (if you could call it a greeting) and seated by the same hostess, and she (shorter girl with big, high bun) was awfully unpleasant. For example: tonight when we entered she just looked, grabbed menus and hardly asked, \"2?\" while motioning us over to a booth. She then sat us and walked away without another word. Later, I almost bumped into her on our way out and she just kept walking and muttered, \"bye\".  While I don't expect spectacular service from a Chili's, the hostess' poor attitude is a big turn-off"}
{"text":"My mom and I had lunch here recently after shopping at the nearby outlet mall. It was right at lunch time so the place was busy.  We had too wait a few minutes for a table but it was not too bad.  We ended up in the bar area at a high-top table which was fine.    At first, our waitress was fine, attentive, took our drink and food order quickly.  Then later, we had to track someone else down to get our final bill.  We did try to use the automated table top machines but we had the wrong one on our table.  The other waitress did figure it out and we finally got our bill, way longer than it should have taken.  I had the chicken and shrimp fajitas.  They were tasty but the onions could have been cooked a lot longer.  They were practically raw.  And you want that charred onion taste with fajitas.  My mom had a BBQ burger.  She said it was just okay.  She has had better.  So not sure we will come here again as there are lots of other options around the outlets."}
{"text":"ok, so the hostess is the first person to greet you huh??  nope...she was behind the scenes doing whatever for the first 4 minutes of standing there.  then she asked how many and said she would be right back...10 minutes later she comes back to a growing crowd of people...takes their names (not ours), but then escorts to our seats.  The waiters were really good, but we almost left...plenty of other places."}
{"text":"Busy place...won't allow baby sling at end of table. Ribs...I sent them back. Hardly any meat on the rib and presentation damaging. 6 ribs on a white plate with some potatoes I cast iron skillet. Definately not worth $$. Manager kindly exchanged my food for another item...explaining rib was lean so that's why they were so small...should be in the description...if you want ribs...go to real rib joint."}
{"text":"Stranded in CU for Snowmageddon 2014.  Chili's was the only place open.  The team worked hard to serve hungry people in understaffed mode.  Special cudos to Caren for working hard to please a busy bar area."}
{"text":"Of all the \"like\" restaurants (IE: TGI Fridays, Ground Round, Etc) I find the food and atmosphere at chili's to be the best and most different. A few of us stopped by after a movie and needed a cold beer as quickly as possible. I ordered the Asian chicken tenders with an Asian ranch dipping sauce. Wings are something chili's does well. Their sliders are phenomenal as well. Not much else to say except IMO Chili's does it right."}
{"text":"Southwest eggrolls!... need I say more.  The service is at this location is great.  They're in the process of remodeling so the bar will definitely be a place to come back and visit once they're done. Because of the side of town is on,  this location is never too busy."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the best time to come and enjoy the deals and chat with a real cutie bartender; Chritina."}
{"text":"Poor service. Considering this Chilis is located on the strip you would expect good service. Wrong. Upon arrival, the place was practically empty and still there was over a 15 minute wait to be seated. The server took forever to take the order, and took even longer to bring it out. I love chilis, but the service at this location was a bad experience."}
{"text":"It's always slow everyone I have come. Around 6 tables and waited around 45 min for food."}
{"text":"I really love it when I enjoy a good meal, great attentive service. All of which I did not receive here.The total cost of my meal was $13.27. I ate there on Sept. 8, 2015, while waiting for my phone that was being worked on at T-Mobile. I chose to sit at the bar, thinking my service would be a little faster, since I was pressed for time, knowing T-Mobile was going to close in 30 minutes.  I ordered a chicken sandwich with chips and salsa. I was not able to finish the sandwich, since it was extremely salty. The chips and salsa weren't bad, so that became my meal. My server, (a guy), never asked me if I enjoyed my meal, or  was everything ok. It seemed like forever trying to get his attention, so I could have a bill. So my rating for this short bad experience is as such. No, I won't be back, even if someone else is paying. You've got some work to do my friends."}
{"text":"If you're looking for sub standard food, steak not cooked right the first time and when you send it back it comes the exact same way, service that doesn't write down what you want as sides or takes forever for drink refills than this is the place to be.   I understand that this is a chain resteraunt and the level of giving a crap about your customers is low but I'm still spending money..."}
{"text":"Well. Overall I do like this place. They have good food and reasonable prices. However, I wouldn't order any steaks. I do know they are not a steak house and they prove it. First, they cook steaks on a flat top not an open grill which just leaves to sit and cook in its own juices, second, they go by temperature of the meat to tell them when it's done not the feel which is ok if you make sure that the temperature is consistent through out the meat. I have been to a couple of chilis and both the same result. I order medium and it ends up where most of the stake is almost still raw, purple, not just link with blood, raw.   I was told that medium is mostly pink and pointed to the menu that states medium is \"light pink with no traces of red\" so obviously the cooks don't understand the different temperature of meat.   If you order a steak tear it a part. Don't just cut into the center because that will not give you the whole story..."}
{"text":"Update #2: ordered burgers for take out. I ordered the Southern Smokehouse Burger- VERY GOOD! applewood smoked bacon, sharp cheddar cheese, house-made garlic dill pickles, spiced panko onion rings, lettuce, tomato & Chili's Signature sauce (that was smartly delivered on the side in a cup!) It's best to get all those flavors and layers into one bite if you can manage it, because they all intermingle in a very delicious way."}
{"text":"Chili's used to be my go to place for ribs and margaritas until they changed their menu up on me! It would still be my weekly go to if they still ha the blackberry margaritas and the Memphis dry rub ribs!! Bring them back and I will be there weekly again lol"}
{"text":"Went to have lunch on Veterans Day. We were immediately greeted by friendly staff and the manager came out specifically to shake the hand of a veteran in my party and thanked him for his service. Very respectful and so appreciated. We didn't expect any special Veterans Day deals but they had a special Veterans menu, entree was free for all Veterans!  Nice surprise!  Manager ended up taking off both our meals. The bean burger was excellent as always!  Thank you for the great service and good food!"}
{"text":"Seated quickly and greeted warmly. We always know what to expect at Chili's.  Our server, Hailey, was an absolute sweetheart. She was very attentive and patient with our boys.   We had our classic favorites: crispy honey chipotle chicken tenders, cajun shrimp pasta, kids' corn dog meal and a sirloin for the pre-teen.  Food was prepared as described.   There was a malfunction with the ziosk and it did not allow hubby to redeem his points. A manager quickly rectified the situation."}
{"text":"Weird customer service almost rude, from our greeter to our server, service was mediocre at best. Food  is overpriced and wasn't good , this was our first time in a chili's, we received a gift card for xmas , long story short we won't return ."}
{"text":"When walking the strip looking for food that doesn't require a loan to procure Chili's to the rescue. Service is great, patio view is outstanding and the beers aren't $7.50+.   If you are into people watching ask to sit on the patio, great view of the Aria."}
{"text":"Compliments all around... hostess, waiter, bussers, kitchen & cooks...let's not forget the FOOD. Trio Fajita, rib eye steak and onion  rings...hands down!"}
{"text":"Food is as throwaway as any other Chili's, so skipping that. 3 stars is for them having the correct brand of energy drinks I wanted in the cooler. Sure, it took forever for them to ring me up (maybe not forever - not like I missed a flight and am still there waiting), but it did take unusually and excessively long, not to mention charging me a price that would normally get me about 3 cans in anywhere not either a sports stadium or airport. Still, I was glad they had not only the right flavor, but that the cans were clean, unlike a certain place in Salt Lake City's airport."}
{"text":"I decided to get a bite to eat after shopping and the place was practically empty.  The server was great and I only ordered the soup and salad because they didn't have the shrimp tacos or Mac n cheese. Was told their menu varies from the traditional Chili's menu."}
{"text":"I can't complain!  My family ended up here after a busy day of running errand and it was a mid Saturday afternoon.  Despite the crowd we got a table right away and the waitstaff was very attentive.  I never waited for my glass to be refilled (a biggie for me) and my children were served fast, with friendly service.  When my kids are happy, I am happy!  Our order was brought out fast and everything was correct.  We never wanted for anything.  Extra napkins were brought out without being asked and when I dropped my fork I had another one by the time I picked up the one I dropped.  The restrooms were clean and neat.  Nothing out of order.  Worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Overpriced airport drinks (but that was expected).  The waiter was friendly though.  'nuff said"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Ordered a 3 course meal, at a set price. My entree came first and when I asked about my salad they brought it out 5 minutes later. My salad was hot like it was sitting under a warmer. The waitress apologized and the manager also came over and apologized. We finished our meal and 10 minutes later we paid our bill at the kiosk because the waitress wasn't around. We finally got a hold of the waitress because our receipt didn't print and also asked for our dessert to go because she never brought it. She said they don't bring it unless you ask for it.  We told her this isn't the first chilis we have been to and the waitress is always attentive to the patrons and do not need to be reminded about when to bring the food out. She disputed the  process with me and basically told me the other waitresses were not suppose to do that. This was the worst experience ever, we will NOT return to this location ever and also not recommended this Chili's to anyone."}
{"text":"We did the 2 for $20 deal, we had the Texas Cheese Fries which were greasy, cheesy and delicious for our appetizer. I had the margarita like chicken and my fiancé had the chicken fingers, fries and corn on the cob. The service was quick and we were in and out in less then an hour."}
{"text":"We love going to Chili's. The place is very kid friendly and has no problem making accomodations for the kids like food substitutes or changing drinks. The staff is also very kid friendly. We love the food and the fact that they have a cheap appetizer in chips and salsa which our kids also enjoy and doesn't rack up the bill."}
{"text":"It's Chili's. Pretty much been to one, been to them all. My group agreed to come here simply because it was about a 5 minute walk from our hotel. However this one had some sort of discord. There was a 10-15 minute wait, ok cool. Even though we can clearly see there is 4 tables available. Already been busted. Whatever. Maybe there is a queue? No. We're just sitting here because you can make us? Ok.  So, while we waited, we browsed through the menu and knew exactly what we were ordering. Then the hostess went outside and spoke to someone. There was a couple that was outside giving directions to someone to get here. That was the hold up?! So, we couldn't just sit at one of the OTHER tables? Whatever. We were about to leave when they decided to seat us. Our waiter came by and greeted us, then told us to give him a minute and he disappeared into the kitchen. He reemerged with a plate and served a table, then came back. He asked if we were ready and we placed our orders. I asked for boned in hot wings, and was told there were no wings of any kind. I was upset because that's what I had my heart set on. He told me to hold on and went into the kitchen. He quickly came out and told me there was boneless available. Ok, that's cool. He got the rest of the orders and we had to stop him before he left because he didn't get our drink orders. We waited for about 20 minutes before he stopped back at the table to drop off chips and salsa. And came back 20 minutes later to serve our food. We waited for a total of 40 minutes for some hot wings, a burger with fries, two salads, and a soup. My wings were pretty good, but not 40 minutes good. We ate and then our waiter came back to ask about splitting the check. Before we could say anything, he suggested 2 checks. No. We all said we wanted it separate. He still said 2 checks. No. 4. 2? 4!!!!! Then he finally got it. We debated on leaving a tip, but decided not to be one of those people. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst chilis I have ever been to. This is the second time they forgot something on my pick up order. And both times it happened to be the side I paid extra for. On top of that they gave my the wrong sauce for my chicken. I will never be going back here again."}
{"text":"Chilis is Chilis.  The food is ok, not great, not bad, just ok.   This location has reviews at both extremes and most of it revolves around the service and not the food.  The honey had a pasta dish that was properly prepared.  I had a Craft Burger that was tasty.   The fries could have been warmer but they were still decent.    First impressions leave a lot to be desired. The small trash can near the doors was overflowing with trash.  Considering how nice the rest of the plaza is, it really stood out.  The reason for the 4 stars was our server.  He was the bartender and it was a slow Sunday night and he did everything right.  If all of the servers acted like Afonso, this place would be slammed all the time."}
{"text":"Went here for with some friends for husbands birthday, Happy Hour all days on Sundays....NEED I SAY MORE?  We sat at a table in the bar area and had two 2 for $20 meals, incredible value for 4 people to eat more than we could handle with left overs for $40!  Waitress was fun and joked back with us, excellent time had by all."}
{"text":"I've been to this Chili's a couple of times prior. We were seated immediately and we were waited on by Christopher. Our server was very friendly. At first, it seemed somewhat slow, but then progressed. We ordered the Southwestern Eggrolls--a family favorite. For dinner, I had the Sirloin with Grilled Avocado. I'm not a huge tomato or mixed greens fan, so that was left to the side. The steak; however, was delicious! I would definitely get this again. Chili's is always changing their menu, but they consistently have great food. This location is very clean and the food is great! Will be back!"}
{"text":"We often go to enjoy the happy hour specials, but even the 2 for $20 meal deal is good. Free chips and salsa and good cold beer keep us coming back. The only issue I had on most recent visit was because I ordered a house margarita that tasted awful. So bad in fact I could not finish it...that must be bad! We love the Texas Cheese Fries and the chips are delish. Next time I will be sticking to the ice cold beer!"}
{"text":"Worst service!!! My husband and I were there for 2 hours and all we had was soup and salad... yes, that is all. Couldn't get a refill on our drinks, couldn't get one on our soup either. But about a half hour after our soup was delivered she said oh let me grab your salad. At that point there was no need. I am pretty sure the waitress was named Tia. Avoid her section her service sucks and so does her attitude."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch!  The free wifi was definitely a plus.  Our waitress had a few tables, but she made it a point to make sure we were ok.  I tasted the burger bites for the first the first time and was extremely pleased!   Why hadn't I tried these sooner?!  Overall, it was a pretty good lunch at a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Chili's, a blast from the past. I have always passed right by this place when visiting The Arboretum, but decided, \"why not\", to give it a try. I arrived a little after 12:00pm on Sunday afternoon and requested a booth, which I received. Once seated I was greeted for my drink order and asked if I would like chips, absolutely! The chips were SO fresh and I truly enjoyed the salsa. My margarita arrived, delish! After reviewing the menu I asked the waitress for her thoughts between two dishes and she highly recommended the fajitas. I ordered the chicken fajitas with the side of rice and beans, for an extra $.99. Note: Won't bother with the rice and beans next time. As for the fajitas, they arrived, not sizzling and a little blah, as you can see from my first photo. I requested they re cook the chicken and veggies, well done, and they were amazing, see 2nd photo. I ate the entire dish, while I continued to enjoy the chips, and got some to to :-). So, I was torn on my review, but my reasoning for 3 stars at this point: 1st visit in years, second, the hostess seemed to be monitoring the tables consistently, which made me feel rushed. I know restaurants expect a good turnaround, especially at lunch, however, I was not sitting there talking. I ordered a second drink and continued to eat, until I was ready to go. I do hope to get back soon, try something different and update my review.  Overall, I am glad I stop at Chiki's and look forward to giving them another shot or two."}
{"text":"The service here is really slow but the staff were very helpful. Food was also great but the steak was very chewy, the fries were amazing too. I would definitely have the strawberry lemonade, would 10/10 recommend. Yum"}
{"text":"A year or two ago, Chili's updated their menu. And in doing so, eliminated the best burger from any chain, and maybe any burger joint, the Ground Peppercorn Burger. But today, the staff informed me that even though it is not on the menu, they still will make items from the old menu, and I was able to order one. It was every bit as good as I remember. The staff here is excellent, food preparation was very good. The only downside is that the interior is a bit dated, and they don't have wi-fi(if you need such a thing)."}
{"text":"Consistently underwhelming in every way possible.  I suggest that if you hope to get any kind of regular service that you do NOT sit in the bar area.  I'm even having a difficult time coming up with a review because this place is just so blah.  This place generally has slow service, mediocre food at best, and sometimes dirty tables.  Anything you buy here can be found prepared better somewhere else.  Try writing a comment to corporate HQ and marvel at the generic reply you get back.  Tell them you think the music was too loud.  Tough luck.  Tell them you don't think that the kind of music they play on a busy Friday night is appropriate for families.  They'll tell you it's piped in from corporate and they have no control.  Make ANY suggestion and see if anything ever changes.  Yet myself and hundreds of other knuckleheads will be told there will be a 25-30 minute wait for this rudimentary dogchow, and we wait each and every time.  I only go here because my daughter likes it.  Guess I have to be the mean daddy and say no.  What's the definition of insanity?  Trying the same thing over and over again, expecting different results."}
{"text":"Great experience. Came here on a Friday night with my baby girl, and Rich took care of us. He was very personable and attentive. Quesadilla explosion salad was on point as always and my daughters kids pizza was so good!"}
{"text":"For the past 8months we've had nothing but negative experiences yet we keep going back hoping management has changed,after this last visit it's clear that it has not. The wait time is Always an issue,it took 30mins just for our drinks,my son's milk was completely forgotten about until he was close to finish with his meal yet she still charged for it. The customer service Is horrible here,the manager,Martin was very accommodating with even doing something as simple as doing separate checks,I've never been to a restaurant where they literally do nothing to try and correct issues or can not even seperate checks. They lost our business for good as well as the business from our family and friends who have also noticed the Awful service at this location. They need to change and soon if they plan on staying in business that's for sure."}
{"text":"I would never say, \"Hey, let's eat at Chili's tonight!\" It's really not my cup of tea. However, props to the company for the thorough allergen menu(s). We stopped by for lunch on a Sunday and were able to confidently get our 10 y/o a bacon cheeseburger and fries with no worries. Service was attentive and friendly. Utensils were spotty and some pieces a bit dirty, like they'd been overloaded in the dishwasher. While the kid downed his burger, we had salads ... that each cost more than the burger. Overpriced little chicken salads! :) Will we be back? In a pinch, sure. But for chain restaurants with allergen menus, I prefer Red Robin."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews for this location before walking in made me want to turn around and leave. SO glad we decided to go. We walked in the door, and within 30 seconds were greeted, and sat. Our server, Pablo, came up a few minutes after and greeted us with a smile. Drinks came quick, and the food was delivered at the right times. Salad first, appetizer next, and food not to far behind. My boyfriend had the full rack mix and match combo, which was delicious. I have the classic 6 oz sirloin, and which was a little more red than I ordered, but absolutely delicious. Every single person who came to our table was friendly, and made the experience better. A person who looked to be the manager also stopped by. The atmosphere was buzzing. People laughing, and servers joining in on the fun. I'm not sure what happened for this place to receive so many negative reviews, but we were impressed. Overall, we had a great date night, and glad we picked Chilis. THANK YOU Pablo, and the staff of this restaurant for making this a great experience!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of most chili's establishments; however, I am no fan of this establishment.  I will not be back.  Food was not good.  Was literally disgusting.  Dirty tables everywhere.  It was obvious our server was on some sort of narcotic.  I think all the servers are on drugs.  They were all constantly dropping things, refilling wrong drinks, getting orders wrong.  Place is a complete and utter disaster."}
{"text":"One of our favourite spots. Only downside is they run out of product too often. Most of the servers are great!"}
{"text":"Wow, really not familliar with Chilis. Went and had the two for $20 special. Sat in the bar and service was average. The food was wonderful. Some of the best combination fajitas I have ever eaten. It was an additional $2 to make my fajitas combination chicken/steak. Very worth it. Great food."}
{"text":"Love their margarita selection!  Service was awesome and I love that they have a card machine at your table, at least in the bar they did.  I counted, and I think there were only like 9 seats at the actual bar here, and then some tables a few booths in the bar.  And obviously many more seat in the restaurant part.  Our food was good, we both had chicken sandwiches.  That entree hasn't changed much since I worked at a Chili's in Seattle back in the 90s.  Their presentation has changed a lot though.  Gone are the cheesy crappy cheap plastic baskets and now the food comes on a nice white plate with a stainless steel crate for the fries.  I will say, for $50 though the dinner didn't fill me up.  I wish they had bottomless fries like Red Robin, or at least gave a bigger portion.  I think there are probably like 16 fries or something.  Kinda cheap for that.  But drinks were good.  Not a great TV set up in the bar so if you're trying to watch sports probably head to Bambinos or Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"I went to this chilis last night with an old friend for dinner... but I accidentally kind of ate dinner at Liberty Market before I went (oops....curse their delicious yet filling coffee and desserts!). So my friend and I just shared some chips and salsa and a chicken jalapeno quesadilla. So our waiter was on his first day and made some mistakes.... brought out the wrong type of quesadillas and didn't fill the water when he should of, but I don't fault him and he apologized profusely (too much... ha). The quesadillas just weren't good though. I go to the chili's by ASU a lot, and the food is generally fine, it is what it is, but it's convenient and good. The food last night was not good. The chicken tasted weird and half of the pieces were crispy and the other half were soggy....So a meh for this place.... I'd probably give it another shot if someone wanted to go here, maybe it was just an off night."}
{"text":"Not normally a fan of Chillies but my parents like it so I don't pass up free food. Food is normally alright  which is fine with me. Service is ALWAYS slow at this particular one especially in the open seating bar. Takes forever to get a server let alone the food, they seemed understaffed and may benefit more from putting a few more people on. This is not just a one time thing either, this has happened on 2 or 3 occasions over the past few months when we go in. Not sure how dining service is but just know if you're going to the open seating bar area that the service will be crazy slow and you may need to free up your schedule."}
{"text":"Great location with a friendly staff. I was in the area for an appointment and decided to pop in for happy hour. I've always loved Chili's and this location is my favorite. Our bartender Krista was amazing. She was all smiles and really attentive. She made great suggestions and made sure we had what we needed. It's kind of a drive for me, but with their great happy hour and staff like Krista, It's well worth the drive! (And they have table top trivia!)"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch before my flight back to the Big Apple.  It was actually a nice experience.   My server was friendly.   She kept my glass of seltzer full (although it cost $3.49!)  Food-wise, my wings were good. Very spicy , but I like that.  I had some burger bites and they were pretty decent too.  However, they suffer from the scourge of all tiny burgers in that they are too easily cooked well done.   Overall, this is a decent spot for a bite.  If you're in a hurry,you might want to pass it by, though, as the food took some time to come out."}
{"text":"Today I came here alone and this feels like a different restaurant. It's a Monday on a cold day so it's slow here at 5pm.  The waitress shows me the screen and shows me how to use it. From the screen I can see some stuff but not all, and the prices are not shown so I go to the menu. The waitress is great but because it is slow, she checks with me every 1-2 min to see if I'm ready.I order a skillet queso right away. What came was a fry pan with some orange/brown sauce with little lumps of meat (?). I though this was a mistake and after I had tasted it to see if I wanted it (yuck) I called the waitress over and told her it wasn't Queso and I didn't want it. She said it was how they made it. I told her it was like no other Queso I've ever had, I didn't like it and she took it back, although they did charge me for the chips and salsa which I didn't order.  After She then checked with me 3 more times to get me to order so I ordered a burger, that's as far as I had gotten in looking over the menu. The burger was out right away and I asked for a little mayo. I get that just in case the meat is dry. This was a very dry burger. I had trouble because the knife was dirty and I asked for another and it too was dirty so I used a fork because it looked clean. The fries that came with the burger were cold and dedicated and I didn't eat them. I can't believe how bad the food quality   has gotten here. I think this may be the last time for this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for airport breakfast sporting a migraine headache. Disappointing on all counts. 6 choices for breakfast--breakfast burrito, omelette variations, 1 classic breakfast. Coffee $3.39 a cup, served with coffee grounds and one of those flimsy plastic stir sticks. I ask for a spoon, one never appears. This is a restaurant--did someone steal the spoons?? Ordered a veggie frittata sans cheese. This is TexMex but that doesn't mean you spice food up so much your mouth is still burning 10 minutes later. Service was marginal. Not stopping in again."}
{"text":"The food is never a disappointment and the staff are very friendly. The compliant that I have is that a lot of the staff didn't know english :/ I was bothered that they didn't understand what I asked for. It took me five times to ask for a coke. The seating isn't very comfortable and I had screaming kids behind me so it didn't make for a good visit."}
{"text":"Well I wish I could give more stars because our waitress Dani was actually pretty awesome. She was attentive and seemed as if she legitimately cared.    When we arrived inside the establishment wasn't busy at all and the hostess was no where to be found.  We waited a few minutes and I even noticed that there were cards on the counter in front of us that had the managers cards on them. I grabbed one of each so I could email both the managers letting them know about the quality of the hostess.    The hostess finally arrives from over from the left back where the wait staff was at; near where we were actually seated and she spent a lot of time there during our visit. She was nice and friendly though;  once she did interact with us.    We had plenty of time before our waitress arrived to look over the entire menu and we knew what we were going to order once she arrived because we sat for almost ten minutes before she did arrived. When she arrived she was actually a great waitress and we were very impressed with her.   When she brought out the food my salad looked great but as I took a few bites in, the damn lettuce was old and slimy. Really freaking gross.  They took the salad off the bill thank god.  The salad also had a small quesadilla which was cold, I'm not sure if it's suppose to be cold or not but really who likes old cold melted cheese?? Not this girl??? But I never did ask because the salad was Awful.    My sons chicken bites were hot and fresh but were covered in tons of breading. I'm sure this comes frozen and premade so I suppose that this isnt the restaurants fault.   My husbands dishes looked great; margarita grilled chicken. He said it really lacked flavored. The chili lime rice tasted like bland stale rice.    I should have gone to skinny fats."}
{"text":"Chili's is basically my favorite place to go when I want to have a burger/wings and/or go out with family and/or celebrate something. There's a lotta fancy restaurants I used to wanna go to for my birthday or anniversary,  etc.  And they all had a couple of things in common: they were all expensive, you had to reserve in advance to get a table you want, and I  never felt comfortable ( the last one is probably just all me ). Anyway, I almost always had a disappointing experience with either getting a table that was in a high traffic zone or just feeling like the food just isn't worth the money.    Then,  I finally came to my senses and realized the solution was there staring me in the face all along!!  Chili's!  So now,  whether it is my birthday,  whether I got a promotion,  whether it's my anniversary or whether I win the lottery,  I will always go to Chili's to celebrate.    I came to this location earlier this week to celebrate my anniversary. I didn't have to make a reservation.  I got to wear shorts and a t-shirt and sit in a comfortable booth. I had wings and a burger and they were amazing. They were worth every penny.  Best of all,  I felt like I belonged there!   Pictures are posted.  I highly recommend the Alex burger and the bone-in wings!!"}
{"text":"OK, I don't like to write about franchises because they are all cookie cutter and have standards, but this takes the cake and has to be said.  I am a big fan of Chili's until recently.  Their new look is a huge upgrade from nasty tiled tables they had which you can see the dirt in the grout making it disgusting to eat off of to the new contemporary clean look.  So the story goes: I don't like their small changes to the menu, removing some of the items such as all the pitas was a huge disappointment IMO.  The quality of the staff has gone down hill quite a bit for the past few months here. As I walk in they seem to really push for eating in the bar area as to opposed to the dining. Even with kids as families walk in they push for the bar area. Probably not the best atmosphere to little Susie or Mikey to hang around a bunch of screaming drunks yelling at 2 week old sports games.  Upon my arrival I was greeted nicely, pushed for seating in the dining area and it was not to busy...the host said 10 - 15 minute wait, I asked if he needed my name and he said \"No\". This got me worried that as more parties arrive that i would be forgotten. Almost premonition I guess. 30 minutes roll by. So enough we just decide to go into the bar area. Only seats available are in the corners. So I choose the highest traffic area. We sit...and wait...5 minutes...still no drinks. A group of girls enter and sit at the other corner. We try to flag down a waitress who at the bar seems to be laughing and talking...but not to guests...to fellow bartenders. This is why I don't like sitting in the bar in restaurants. low staffed and low quality unless your actually at the bar benches.   After being distracted with a light conversation with my wife, I look over and notice that the girls that sat down after us already have drinks.   This was the last straw, got up and left. I was tempted to reach out the manager but was to hungry as 50 minutes passed by.    Overall: I will not be going to Chili's any time soon as we used to be weekly patrons of the the establishment. They changed the look for a nice quality experience but fail to deliver on the experience."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my intention anytime I go out to eat is not write bad mean reviews. I try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt.    That being said. This was horrible all around. It wasn't like food was great and service bad. Both were equally terrible.   First my family walks in. The restaurant wasn't packed but not dead either. Four employees see us but don't come up to greet us, so we wait and wait and wait. 10 minutes go by nothing. I finally say to my husband \"let's just go\" as the hostess finally comes up. I'm nice so I do not say anything. We ask for a high chair. The hostess looks like we ask for something she couldn't do. So I ask instead for a booster seat. That she can get for our son.    Finally we get to our table. Our waitress comes up. Super unfriendly. I can tell she wants us gone even before we order. We order our sons meal and an appetizer. The app was burnt. I ask her opinion btw 2 dishes. She doesn't have one. Ok fine I order my meal big mistake my tortillas taste like rubber. My husband says the same about his meal.   I know you get what you pay for but come on Chilis. I'm not asking for a lot. Friendly decent service and hot food."}
{"text":"It's a Chili's.... at an airport.... so obviously I wasn't expecting much, but I'll give 4 stars because I am in a good mood and was pleasantly surprised with the breakfast burrito. It has some tasty breakfast potatoes, which were clearly steak fries seasoned and cut up into bite size pieces.. but hey, they were good! The guacamole was tasty, and included in the price, not extra (looking at you Chipotle). I feel like it was a great, solid breakfast before heading onto a 3 hour flight."}
{"text":"Food was good, waiter was friendly and doing his best, but he had too many tables, bar was seriously short staffed."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place used to always be a go to for a beer and game at the bar.  Good margaritas this location had a great bartender and the two for dinner special is amazing   What more can you ask for good food good drinks all for a reasonable price"}
{"text":"After spending the day on the Strip my wife wanted to eat dinner at Chili's because the food, while simple, is consistent and you know what you're getting. Unfortunately, the service at this Chili's location is very poor. It took over 1/2 hour to get 2 appetizers sent out, and over 20 minutes for desert. And this was on a slow Tuesday night! That's just unacceptable. We're disappointed that Chili's would allow their standards to get so low as to accept this type of service from one of their locations. We won't be back to this location, ever, and we'll have to re-think our view of Chili's as a safe decision for a good meal."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed in the menu cut they made. I went there tonight and after looking at the menu we decided to walk out. They cut the menu by 40% and the prices went up. We ended up going to Texas Road House where we got steak and two sides, (baked potato, Salad) it was so good plus extra rolls and apple butter to take home. Sorry but Chili's lost a customer today. Their menu is burgers, fajitas and ribs..."}
{"text":"EFF this location! My Gawd... Burger King has better waiters than this location, and that's saying something, because Burger King doesn't have waiters.   I've been to this specific location about 10 times and I freakin' loathe it. My sister asks, \"Rachel, what do you have against Chili's?\" I have nothing against Chili's, it's just this Chili's, along with the one off of Eastern in Henderson that makes a vein pop out of my forehead in rage. The service is horrific. Seriously, what's with this \"helper\" bs that Chili's has started? It's ridiculous because neither waiter asks you if you need anything; they just assume the other one has it covered, so you receive no service, rather than twice the service.   I went here today, 2/13/11 for lunch with my sister and cousin. Our waitress, Ashlie, and her helper who never introduced herself or checked on us (black, pregnant lady) was good at first. I always order the unlimited soup and salad and every time I ask for my salad to come out with the chips, because I never eat the chips, it comes out after the chips are empty. Without fail, the waiters have NEVER given me my salad along with the chips, except today. Wow. Amazing! Jesus must be coming back soon or something because this NEVER happens.   Well I guess Jesus sent out a rain check for his second coming because after that, the service went downhill. Our waitress ignored us the entire time. She'd ask other tables if they needed anything, but would breeze past our table, clearly avoiding us. Did we want drinks to refresh our palates? Well, we were SOL because Ashlie was for dang sure not going to get us more drinks. She took my sister's cup to \"get her a refill\" and never brought it back, let alone came back to our table, so my sister went the rest of the meal without a drink. We were never able to flag down our waitress or her helper to remedy the situation.   While eating, some waitress was complaining about how messy this Chili's was, and asked my sister to move the chair next to her so she could sweep under it. Ummmm... we're eating, how about coming back after we're done eating to sweep the floor? Just a thought.   When it was time to go, or more, it obviously was time to go because Ashlie threw down the check and walked off telling us \"no hurry,\" it took 15 minutes to get my cousin's debit card back. My cousin had a full plate of chicken crispers and fries and Ashlie piled a bunch of empty salad plates on top of the plate full of food, said she was going to go take it to the kitchen and process the check. Funny. We might have wanted a to-go box, but I guess as the waitress it's safer to assume and just toss it all out, rather than ask the customer what they wanted. She went back to the kitchen, and chatted with other waitresses in the entrance of the kitchen, then was lounging on the hostess podium while chatting with the helper server. She walked past my sister, threw my sister the side eye, put her pointer finger in the air and said, \"hold on\" and breezed on past our table to wait on another table. GEEZE, just give us the debit card back! She plunked it down and walked off. My sister made sure to write a big, fat \"NONE\" on the tip line.   I'm sick of waiters thinking that young customers means no tip. Actually, no service means no tip. Her tip went from a few bucks, to one buck, to NONE real quick. EFF THIS LOCATION!!!"}
{"text":"This Chili's used to be CRAP when Magnus Magnusson was the manager (you don't forget a name like that.) Luckily, when the management changed, so did all the staff. They got rid of that stupid \"partner\" waiter thing, thank God.   The food tastes like any other Chili's and of course, like all Chili's, their prices have steadily gone up."}
{"text":"Came here recently with my boyfriend because I had a $25 gift card. Rather than getting our usual 2 for 20 meal we got the 2 for 35 that came with two margaritas, an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. Tequila isn't really my thing but the raspberry gold margarita wasn't half bad. I was just always under the impression that salt is put on the rim...not sugar. Still gave a nice punch nonetheless.  The appetizer we got was the deep friend shredded onion and jalapeño slices with (ranch?) dip. We were surprised that the pieces of onion were so tiny...Seemed more like a garnish than an appetizer. It was huge though, and we just munched one around 80% of it before our entrees came. The seasoning was also very strong, which tasted good before the salt got to me.  I came in with the intention of trying something new, but we both got our usual entrees - ribs and steak. My rare steak was tender and juicy as always, with a touch of butter on top. The loaded mash was flavorful and creamy and the broccoli was cooked to the perfect level of firmness. I saved my garlic toast to take to go but left it there... ):   The dessert was a chocolate chip cookie skillet, which had more chocolate than cookie. We opted out of the chocolate fudge and it was still too sweet. Satisfied my chocolate chip cookie craving though.  All in all, it was a pleasant dining experience because of the gift card paying for most of our meal and the attentive waitress that regularly checked up on us. She did forget to bring the extra BBQ sauce we requested but was easily reminded to.   Our usual entrees were pretty good as always but everything else was average."}
{"text":"I typically don't review \"chain\" restaurant, but I want to say that the service was good (I forgot her name, we sat at a booth in the bar area) this Saturday and foods were good and of great value as well. GRANTED, the only complaint I have (and it seems to be quite common to all locations), is that everything looks and feels sticky. I wish someone can just scrub the heck out of the tables and floors and chairs.   We went to Chili's mainly because they have a Cheap Bites menu that's served all day on Sundays (and we sat at the bar area because I dont' know if this is only for bar patrons). They are also avaliable during the week as \"happy hour\" deal and \"late night\" after 9pm. $4.99 and you get pretty much a full size order. My favorite item on the $4.99 menu is Santa Fe Chicken Salad. The portion is insane, plenty to share. I asked for honey-lime dressing instead of ranch.  While I'm not a big chain diner, I do find Chili's to have good food for great price. $25 to feed 4 people is a good deal!"}
{"text":"My burger sliders were good, fries were hot and service was ok. My wife had a chicken/lime salad, but the avocados were brown and ugly looking. Told server, he took away and that was it. I completed the survey on the computer on the table, it asked did you have a problem, I wrote what the problem was and the next screen said \"submit\". Should have said, what was done about it or something like that. We normally like this location and it wasn't very busy."}
{"text":"I am not normally impressed by chain places, but the entire visit was good today. Had the $10 special, salad, burger and desert.  Our server was very helpful and the place was clean and spacious."}
{"text":"It's a Chili's, an unexpected lunch stop for me today.  I intended to stuff myself at the chinese buffet right up the road, but they decided to fancy it up with crablegs for new year and I simply didn't feel like spending that much money for lunch.  I was hungry, my 1 hour is clicking away, and I pulled into Chili's.  I went for their lunch combo, and for some reason I just wasn't feeling sandwiches.  Instead I got the $8 combo with cajun chicken pasta with a side of soup (chicken enchilada).  The soup was good... I'm a big soup person.  It's similar to a tortilla soup.  The plating was pretty, pasta on one side of the long white plate, a thick slice of garlic toast and the soup on the other end (the one day I forgot my cellphone/camera).  The pasta on the other hand was oh-so-salty.  This is coming from a sodium addict.  Chicken slices were dry.  Pasta chewy.  But I somehow wasn't disappointed, because this is somewhat expected.  Service was great, my waitress was prompt & responsive & polite.  The atmosphere was nice & quiet; I got to read my book.  It was surprisingly relaxing of a lunch."}
{"text":"I have to say it's one of the best Chilis I've been to. I've dined at a few and was not a fan. Today the food was good and service was great!!!"}
{"text":"Came here last night after having to walk out of Heart And Soul Cafe...  honestly, we were ripe for the picking.  Having waited an hour with no food there, you could have given us a rusty bumper with cheese and we would have been happy.  But no.... we ordered the sirloin (which was our first mistake).  When we asked if the kitchen could put some blue cheese crumbles on the steak after it was done, the server looked at us like we had three heads.  She came back out to tell us that the cooks had never heard of it - really?  You've never heard of blue cheese on a steak?  Please.  I ordered the six ouncer and I got maybe two bites out of it...  all sinewy-gross lines.  It was ordered as medium and it about mooed at me - blood everywhere on the plate.  Service was tolerable - had to wait a while to get the check (which is a HUGE pet peeve of ours).  I did not have it in me to talk to the manager... just wanted to go home.  I cut up the leftover steak for my dog's breakfast this morning - it looked like it should have been considered 'waste'.  Horrible.  After a salad, two glasses of wine and two steak dinners, our pockets are $82 lighter.  So not worth it.....   I'll never order anything but a burger IF we decide to come back."}
{"text":"Upon entering we were told there would be a 15 to 20 minute wait, even though there were several empty tables throughout the restaurant. We were then offered a booth in the bar area. I questioned if that would be appropriate with a child. The hostess didn't see the point, but since we had already waited I decided to take the booth. There seemed to be only one waitress for this area which seemed to make waiting inedible. She was nice enough and we enjoyed her humor. Once our orders were taken for food, it seemed to again take awhile before we finally were able to eat. Our waitress brought our meals after an almost 30 minute wait and then seemed to disappear again, leaving us without drinks for quite sometime. Once we were able to get refills, she  was kind enough to bring us to go cups. The meal process took longer than it should have and I probably won't frequently this particular location. It seemed they get more of the tourist type being in front of the outlet malls and just down the street from the Strip."}
{"text":"I go here quite a bit with my fiancé and the reason I'm giving this place four star is because of Amber. She sets the bar very high for every other server that works here. However the other servers we've had ha e been a little slow and take a while to get things going for you. If you can and go here on the weekend I recommend getting a seat in the bar side and request Amber."}
{"text":"We actually eat here fairly regularly so you think I would rate it higher, but when I really think about it, it could be a lot better. I think we mostly end up here for the chips and salsa, lol!  The positives:  The \"endless\" chips and salsa are pretty yummy.  The margaritas are usually really good  I like the new pretzel stick appetizer they have  Most of the servers we have had have been friendly and attentive  The negatives:  The FOOD! Really that is the only thing, but this is a restaurant. I have pretty much given up on trying to get a good meal here. I have tried a million and one things and while parts of it are sometimes good, I have never gotten a consistently good meal. The margarita chicken is good, but the sides suck and seem old and stale. Same with the burger, decent but the fries are usually bad. The kids meals are TERRIBLE, to the point I never even pick this as a place to take the kids for dinner anymore.   Usually if I come here, its the hubby and me for lunch.  When we come we generally get the chips and salsa endless lunch with soup and salad, but lately even the soup and salad kind of sucks.   With all that said, will I be back there at some point enjoying a margarita, chips and salsa and pretzel sticks? Yep. But if I want an actual dinner or lunch, not just a salty (in a good way), carb fest, I would pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped for a quick late afternoon lunch. The place was pretty empty and service was great. She got the \"featured\" item -the chicken and waffles plus fries and I got the choose two from the lunch menu -black beans, rice & a cheese enchilada plus a side salad. We started with the buffalo fried cauliflower -enough for 2+ to share. I've never tried this before anywhere else so I can't compare it to anything but it was battered fried cauliflower with a side of buffalo sauce. It was good but since they were battered fried one could eat so many.  My meal was great -my usual go to here. Since I don't eat meat my friend said her meal was great and was a huge portion enough for 2. I noticed they have updated their menu and have some new items too.  Like I said the service was good probably more workers than customers so our drinks were always filled and our waiter checked on us regularly."}
{"text":"One of the main reasons why I like eating here is that my fiancé and I can find things for both of us to eat. I can get meat free dishes and he can get meat dishes unlike other chain restaurants - Applebee's = sad face --they have little to no meat free dishes not even a damn veggie burger? Ugh. But that's besides the point.  :(  Now back to the awesomeness of Chili's...   I usually chow down on the bottomless chips & salsa, soup and salad. It's on the lunch menu but you can get it for dinner for a few dollars more. I always get the potato soup without the bacon and a house salad. They have new sides on the menu - I also ordered the asparagus and tomatoes and it was great.  The soup is awesome - always hot with chunks of potatoes and topped with cheese, the salad is always fresh and the chips are thin (a good thing) brought to you warm and enough for the whole table to share.  Don't be shy asking for more soup (try the different flavors even) or salad they are happy to get you more.   In past visits I've had the black bean burger which is awesome too. I've tried the margherita flatbread and I will never make that mistake again. It wasn't worth the price and the flavor was not to my liking.  The service is always good -friendly servers - no problems - now they have the newish tablet thingys at the table to pay for your meal, order more drinks, see the menu, play games etc. It's nice to pay the check when we are ready but we end up turning it around - it's a little distracting personally.  Chili's has something for everyone and sign up for the email club and get coupons for free apps and desserts!"}
{"text":"Last week on Tuesday, March 27th at around 2pm my sister in law and I along with our small children went into chilis to eat lunch. Our waitress whom I can't remember the name of because she never introduced herself to begin with was very inattentive. She had short dark hair and was working closer to the bar area. Every table around us was taken care of before we were, refills took forever, we had to find another waitress to get us a refill after all, and we had to literally chase her down to get our boxes for food that took over 40 minutes to get to us in the first place. As moms of small children we don't go out to eat often because it's such a task most of the time, so it was a very disappointing visit and we won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I came to Chili's with another couple for Sunday lunch. We were seated immediately. Our waiter was prompt about getting our beverages. He told us about the specials they had for that day. My wife and I decided to share an appetizer and a main course. We started with the smoked wings and a side of BBQ sauce. they were tender, juicy, and had a sweet smoky flavor. The BBQ sauce was sweet and tangy and worked well with the wings. there were 8 wings. There were 8 wings, just enough to share with another person. A short time later we got the main course. We split the mix and match fajita trio. the meats we chose were chicken, shrimp, and steak. This was served sizzling hot with sliced bell peppers & caramelized onions, topped with chipotle-garlic butter & chopped cilantro. It came with a side of tortillas, sour cream, guacamole, and salsa. the meat was juicy and flavorful. There was enough that we split the meal and were satisfied. Our waiter kept our beverages full the whole time. They have a kiosk to pay the bill with. Our check and the other couple's were combined leaving us confused how to split it. We used cash and had to have the waiter cash out for us.  We would come back for lunch again if the opportunity arises."}
{"text":"This Chili's is similar to the rest. The service is good most of the time, the food is good all the time, and the burgers are good every time. The price is comparable to most franchise chains. Thanks to a gift card my wife and I came in this store. I immediately browsed the burgers settling on the Ultimate Bacon Burger. This is a burger with double bacon, cheddar, pickles, lettuce, red onion, tomato, jalapeño aioli, spicy Buffalo sauce & honey chipotle sauce, all grilled to perfection and served with home fries. The burger was good, the service ok. We don't go to Chili's often but when we do it's an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Not a great first impression.  Of course, I stopped in here hoping to grab a quick breakfast before my flight.  The place was not busy and I was looking to sit at the bar.  There were no open stools, so the hostess sat me right near the bar and told me my server would be right with me.  I sat there for close to 15 minutes and was never approached or even acknowledged.  I ended up walking out, still hungry and waiting by my gate until my flight boarded.  That is unacceptable! The place seemed to be fully staffed, yet they just let people walk in and out.  There are other options in the airport and I will avoid this place the next time I fly out."}
{"text":"This isn't the type of place I usually eat. I'm more of a mom and pop, unique dining or fine dining person. However after a marathon Christmas shopping spree you can beat a $20 meal for 2 people at Happy Hour!  The place was packed so it took a while for our food and drinks to arrive, but it was no big deal. Our server was very nice, the margaritas were actually strong which surprised me and the food was A-OK.   Apparently there is an upside down picture in every Chili's but I did not see it and I even did a loop around the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food: - Steak fajitas (3 portions), comes with rice and beans. I substituted extra rice for the beans. Tasty and consistent! I split it with my 9 year old but 2 portions would have been enough.  - chicken and waffles, not sure if hubby liked it. It had a lot of sauce and seemed over the top. Probably just ok since he didn't say anything   Service:  we had great lunch service from Samantha. She was happy and friendly and checked on us frequently and was on time with drink refills.   Ambiance: People seem to complain about cleanliness, but it was clean when we were there (although early 12pm lunch).   Parking:  Convenient and plentiful near McDonald's."}
{"text":"Waitress was fine. Kept our drinks full. she said they are out of burgers and bacon since it is Sunday. Chicken quesadilla is pasturized process chicken food. Bummer. My plate was dirty. I notified waitress about dried food all over my plate, who notified manager and they  handled it.  probably won't go back but they did rectify the situation."}
{"text":"I have a  food allergy and specifically asked my server Jules to make sure the condiments where on the side when I ordered my burger.  Everything came out great and like most restaurants my server was busy and couldn't be found.  I took into consideration that my order was correct and I had no worries. I've never had issue at this chili's ever. Until tonight!! I took one bite of my burger and something was off.. I proceeded to eat the bite I took. While examining my burger after biting into it. Low and behold the sauce was on the burger. You guessed it I'm allergic to what's in the sauce. I wasn't really happy with the service and with myself for not double checking the food I ordered.  I have to leave because of my allergic reaction.. my wife handled the situation and not an apology from management or from the server.  Very very disappointed because I am in the food industry and I would have made every attempt to make sure the order was correct. I would of apologized emphatically for my mistake and would of smoothed things over with the customer. I will be calling corporate in the morning to complain."}
{"text":"For a chain operation, Chili's has been run pretty well for years.  I like their recent facelift - they didn't change their look so much as to render it unrecognizable from their original look, but it looks more modern and is well-executed.  The menu is vast and pretty much anyone can find something they like.  The service at this particular location has been excellent for our lunch crew, across a number of visits.  Not spectacular, but never disappoints."}
{"text":"12-14-2016 First time at Chili's.  If this is suppose to be predominately upscale Mexican restaurant-YUK!  Salads and dressings are very good and the wait staff very friendly hence 2 stars). We also had cheese enchiladas (totally tasteless-have no idea what kind of cheese it was), the lime rice-way, way too much lime-almost bitter, black beans were flat tasting, beef tacos tasteless, and chicken enchiladas were also bland. I know they offer other food but Mexican was the majority.  We would prefer a greasy spoon authentic Mexican restaurant than overpriced bland crap."}
{"text":"Our server Shaffer made our experience an amazing one! He was super nice, very attentive, food came out hot and looking delicious as always. He's one of the best servers I've had here at this Chilis on the strip and we come quite a bit since we are locals. I also am in the industry and I give him 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Gr8 family chain restaurant w/huge menu.  Faux Tex Mex, burgers, chile and soups, salad and ribs are the good items.  Good service, cheap prices and nice beverages.  However, Chile bowls are small, place is loud and calories dense.  Nice low fat menu finally."}
{"text":"I am normally not a big fan of chain locations like this. I came here based on my friends votes. But the food was tolerable and the service was friendly enough. So nothing to complain about, but nothing to brag about either."}
{"text":"The best happy hour prices in town. All brand new TV's at the bar."}
{"text":"We like chilis for the quick service and chips and salsa. This plCe had fast service that was on top of fresh chips and drink refills. Newer food menu was good. We tried a new burger and a chicken burger and both were great. We will be back."}
{"text":"Not happy to park and get entire family out to walk up to the front door to find out they were closed due to hot water heater was broke. I understand things happen but what a pain. We went a few miles further east and south of the 60 and found a better newer chilis"}
{"text":"Our first time at chili's Started off on a sour note. Parked in the handicapped slot and went in.  Nobody acknowledged our presence for five minutes.   When we were finally acknowledged asked if we were picking up an order. No need a table for two. Was instructed to go around the corner and the host will assist you.  Ah I'm with a handicapped person who has trouble walking.   Why can't you seat us??  So I just picked a table and sat.  Our waitress Christina was fantastic.  Thank you Christina!!!!! She turned it around for us."}
{"text":"First the service was average! We waited a bit to long to order and get our food! The food was average for Chilis, but when my wife and daughter got the steak they order, wow rediculous!! Now why I see why it is 2 meals for 10dls. The steak looked like two stones, horribly over cooked and looked like a piece of frog so small. I guess that's what to expect when u get the 2 for 20dl meal, not worth it at all!!"}
{"text":"We were seated right away in a booth as we requested. We had two servers who were attentive and nice. Food came out quickly, it was hot and tasted good. The restaurant was clean and staff friendly."}
{"text":"Chili's in the food court at Concord Mills. It's open and exposed, which is nice. As you enjoy their limited menu, you can people watch and still catch some sports on the TV. It's the same Chili's service, even if they don't have everything that a regular Chili's might have.  I went with the Chipotle chicken bowl, which had plenty of tastiness in there with sliced grilled chicken, avocado, lettuce and spiced rice. Quite good and quite filling. I'd have this again.  The gal who served us did a great job of keeping our drinks refilled, even if we didn't have beer or cocktails. And for $2.39 for a Diet Coke and $2.39 for a club soda, darned right we'll have three of them."}
{"text":"Chain restaurant ribs, I should be ashamed of myself. They were okay, but certainly not nearly as good as any of the other great BBQ places in the Queen City. But when it's late and you're tired and you're not choosing the restaurant, they're A-OK.  Service was okay. She got the beers taken care of and the check brought out properly. The others in my party enjoyed their meals - the food was hot and it was tasty.  I have no complaints."}
{"text":"It's Chilis - nothing to rave about. Inside decor is nice. Restaurant is clean. Food was that mediocre hit or miss quality that you come to expect from a big, neighborhood chain restaurant.   One thing my wife and I did find exceptionally annoying, though, was our waitress. She paid almost no attention to our table and, when she did, she tried to cram in as many of her duties at once. For instance, halfway through our meal, both of us still eating and with forks in hand, she asks, \"Can I get you some boxes to go? Will you be having any dessert?\" We told her that we weren't sure about either yet as we were still mid-meal but that we'd let her know. However, she never checked back with us and we didn't see her again until 15 minutes after we had both finished entirely when she brought the check.   Also, we received only one water refill the entire time (pre-meal) in which she spilled water all over the table filling my glass and then said to me, \"I'll bring you some extra napkins so you can soak that up.\" Huh? ME clean that up??   Based on our experience, I think the other reviewers complaints about service are legit. Don't imagine we'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Food was typical Chili's which is what you expect when you go there, but terrible service, sat at the bar and the bartender was never behind the bar the entire time we had lunch. Never refilled out tea and had to ask for a beer. Then had to flag someone for our check. Restaurant had a horrible cleaned my smell as well. Choose someplace different, Chili's just isn't the same for a quick bite and a beer."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed in Chili's now they did away with the cheese enchiladas and put chicken in it's place. The wait staff was great got us our orders right away and kept our drinks full.  My sister was pleased with her meal while like I said for a semi vegetarian the menu disappointed me. But took home most of my meal and it was delicious"}
{"text":"When in for lunch and was greeted very politely by the front and and waiter.  I like their cheese enchiladas , Because they are because they are spicy and can make two additional meals."}
{"text":"My family met at Chili's for a late lunch.  Many of the tables were filled.  Our server was attentive, even as she had other tables.  I ordered the shrimp tacos and as a shrimp lover, they were delicious!  The combination of spicy chile-lime sauce and house-made pico de gallo and sliced avocados made me a new fan of Chili's!  The only issue during the visit where the people at neighboring tables.  I won't go into details...it's a free country."}
{"text":"I like eating here for the soup.  But this time the service was horrible. They kept my daughter waiting for her chicken tenders, REALLY???  Our food was cold by the time she got her food, then they only gave us a discount."}
{"text":"They drastically cut the menu and that sucks. I liked the more options and had to settle on something I didn't really want and end up not earing half of it. The kiosk machines are a pain in the butt to use. Server was nice but all over the place."}
{"text":"1 star.  Only because I can't give it 0 stars.   Sat for 15 minutes, nobody greeted us.  We left...  Smelled funny, clearly understaffed, many tables were empty with dirty dishes."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this location dining in. The service was fine and my server was excellent  with my two kids. The food was good and the drinks were awesome. However, two days later I attempted to order over the phone to go and received the worst service of my life. The first attendant answered the phone with such an attitude I was tempted to ask to speak to someone else. I asked to order the special I received in store and was told I could order that same special to go. Then the attendant passed the phone to another person who immediately told me that I could not place the same order I was just told I could place. I explained that I was just told that I could place the order and she replied that she could get someone else to take my order but that they would tell me the same thing. She then hung up the phone. The worst to-go service I've ever received. I was very disappointed because I had just had such a great experience at this location. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Driving around we ask ourselves where can we get a good steak and not break the bank and we thought Chili's! In the past I've had great ribeyes from this place but tonight it was a major fail. The rib eye had no juice, I even made a comment it seemed as if it was fake meat. It also had this big blob of butter on it but it was a garlic butter that thru off the whole plate. The whole thing tasted like the jar of garlic was old n turning ranced...you ever buy a big jar of garlic from Costco and you can't use it fast enough and its starts tasting funny..exactly how dinner tasted. Major disappointment . Now, I got offered a new steak after everyone was done eating and my dinner was already ruined. Chili's let me down as a faithful go to and lost a customer probably for a very long time."}
{"text":"*military discount*  Went tonight 7-11-15 for dinner around 7pm. Our server was Aviunna. My friend and I did the 2 for $20 menu. We shared chips and salsa and she had the quesadilla and I had the chicken pasta. I love Chili's tortilla chips because they are thin and crispy and always served hot.  They have bottled root beer here and it was so good! It was a good experience, exactly what you'd expect from a restaurant like Chili's. Keep up the good work :D"}
{"text":"Do not go here or any chilis. I ordered take out they forgot half my order and the food was old and dry. Highly pissed calling corporate."}
{"text":"What can I say... It's Chili's.  I was hungry and was looking for a place to watch the MSU game and text friends that we're doing the same.  Thinking I'd just grab a bite here before moving on, I went into the bar and plopped into a booth.  A quick scan of the TVs revealed that they did have the game on, so I ordered the Margarita Grilled Chicken along with a pomegranate Margarita (see the theme here).  Food came out and it was great and the drink was strong and yummy.  I was worried I was going to be rushed to leave when the bill came, but to my surprise that never happened and I felt comfortable watching the rest of the game there."}
{"text":"Was greeted by a woman at the door and then greeted nicely by host and hostess inside.  The hostess took us to our booth.  We could not sit down due to wet seats(they had been recently wiped clean by the bus boy).  Waiters and waitresses were busy so by a minute or two the table across left and we grabbed extra napkins to wipe our seats and sat down.  First up Terlingua Chili.   The  chili has a lot of peppers in it but tasted more sour than hot.    The ribeye steak was choice but tasted better than the prime steak which I ordered at Larsen's.  Maybe due to it being marbled and the fat content.  The loaded mashed potatoes were good albeit a bit pasty.  The broccoli was really good and crisp.   The waiter was very friendly as were the people at the doors.   Music was at a good volume.  Lots of older people dine here.  The prices are fair.   Due to the quality of the choice steak and the friendly people and the prices I would give it 4 stars.  However the food could be better.   Also the details in the service need attention (dry seats after cleaned)"}
{"text":"Really great food with a little flare and lots of flavor. We had loads of fun with the trivia game console the table. The steaks, flatbreads and salads are awesome. We had quick service, an excellent waiter, delicious meals, and a great time playing trivia. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ordered a 2 for 20 deal and my grilled chicken pasta was good however cannot say the same for the chicken bacon ranch quesadilllas. There was barely any cheese and what was there was dried up and a couple tiny  pieces of bacon. We come here often and we were dissapointed and felt ripped off. Not only to say we called in our order, got there 25 minutes later and still waited 10 mins. Seemed like they forgot our order and didn't say anything that's why the quesadilla was horrible."}
{"text":"Our server was good. The food was nothing exciting. I haven't been impressed by a Chili's in quite a while. Our salsa and chips were very tasty, but the salsa was so thin, that nothing stayed on the chip. It was like spicy red water. The lunch specials are a good deal though."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and it was very good and we had a very good waitress. Had the dinner for 2 of house salad and chicken and bacon quesadilla very very good. We will be back."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place a zero I could. For the food that is. Service is okay. But most of the time when you walk in the tables are dirty and servers are just walking past them like they don't see it. My food was horrendous, I ordered the sunny side burger or something and my egg was over hard (I ordered it over easy), my burger was so over cooked but I decided to give it a try anyways. I had to spit it out. The patty was falling apart and the bun was so greasy. So, I sent it back and ordered a whole other burger AND HAD THE SAME ISSUE!?!?!?!?!? This time I ordered the jalapeño burger and the server warned me it would be spicy and it had no flavor??? Sent that one back as well. This isn't the first time I've had nasty food there either."}
{"text":"I've always gone to this particular location for large gatherings of my friends. I've eaten at this location so many times over the past several years that I've lost count. I keep returning because the food is always spectacular and what is expected, the service is always pleasant and on time, and even if there's a wait for a table, our experiences have always been delightful and we've really enjoyed the food. The place always appears to be very clean and of course, I really like that!"}
{"text":"I'm generally not a fan of restaurant chains--more of a local ingredients gal--however, Chili's is a solid, comforting option on long workdays or to meet up with pals. The margaritas, presidente and chambord 1800, are soothing escapes. The fajitas, in their sizzly goodness, are a tasty way to fill your belly. And, of course, the soup and salad combo (at around $6) cannot be beat with a giant stick. Chicken enchilada soup paired with a house salad with guacamole ranch. Seriously, mmm. Second fave is the black bean burger . . . wait, the tilapia . . . no, the buffalo salad. You feel me. The key reason for my review is to commend Danielle at the takeout counter. When I called, she was polite, thorough and charming. I was even more impressed how she handled the order, specifically that she double checked the to-go bag for all the dressings, utensils and even tortilla shreds (soup garnish). She is a reflection of what service should be, and it was awesome to be reminded that whatever your calling, you should take it to the nth degree. Hop off the 202 and enjoy."}
{"text":"Filthy! What is it with restaurants not deep cleaning the high chairs? My kids highchair had smashed food on the seat strap that I unfortunately had to touch to latch her in and the highchair itself was greasy. Menus were greasy and the tablet (yes, before my little one started to play with it), was greasy.   Food was ok, not thrilled about the menu cuts/changes. Southwest eggrolls used to be stuffed with filling, not much of anything inside them anymore. Minimum wage went up so yes, Chili's is definitely one of the restaurants who raised their prices as well as reduced portion size dramatically! $17 for an appitizer-sized plate of fajitas. Tiny dallop of slightly brown, bland guacamole, only enough to spread evenly on two of the four fajitas. Not impressed, won't be back. Used to be one of my favorite restaurants. Bummer."}
{"text":"4:30 my comment to my husband as I checked in to Chili's on Yelp, \"how can a Chili's only have 2.5 Stars?\" The indifference and \"dirty tables\" that the 2 hostesses were not willing to clean to accommodate a customers, is where I would say the 2.5 Stars starts. Chili's isn't fine dining, but standard fare that you can typically count on it being good. The disinterested lazy wait staff lost our interest before we Evan \"chose our own\" table in the bar. We walked out - Chili's should NEVER be below 3 Stars. The disinterested, lazy staff that \"welcomes\" you to the restaurant  is a reason this one is and we didn't even get to the food. SMH"}
{"text":"No host at entrance, server took 10 min to take drink order. Food took 50 min and my kids fries took another 20 to get to the table. Food was not hot. Server never cleared our table of extra plates or cups. Didn't receive any napkins or utensils until I asked took another 10 min."}
{"text":"We ate at Chili's on Nov 22nd, 2016. We arrived in time for Happy hour. I was expecting some reasonably priced beers and api's but was disappointed. No real deals to be had compared to Kona Grill or Pita Jungle. Food and service was slightly above average.  On all tables they have electronic screens for looking at the food and drink menus...you can also pay for your bill with a quick swipe of your card. .....be careful because the Ziosk charges to play games, yes really! What a dumb idea!!!!! as if people aren't already too consumed with their portable electronic devices, Chili's decided to install screens at all their tables so that guests will even be more distracted and have less conversation than before. Dumb, dumb, dumb.....you won't be seeing me at another Chili's..."}
{"text":"This location was horrible! I usually really enjoy Chili's but this was a horrible experience starting with the service. The to go area was closed, no one would take out to go order, when I finally asked a waiter to ring us up, they acted like it was a huge favor. The food was horrible, compared to what I usually eat at chilis. We ordered the smoked wings, half of which looked like they were underdone. They were more fried then smoked, and had a plastic after taste. We also got the egg rolls, which were also underdone... they were not crispy on the outside, but looked like they were frozen and then heated in the microwave. This was below the standard of chilis!!!!"}
{"text":"We were forced to stop somewhere for dinner when driving back home, and this happened to be the only chain on the side of the road. I'm just glad it was a Chili's since that is one of the few chains that I don't mind going to when the need arises.  We hopped in at around 7pm on a Sunday and were seated immediately. The waitress came right over to take our orders but seemed a bit sad that we didn't order alcoholic drinks. Sorry we were in the middle of a several hour car ride where drinking isn't the smartest idea!   My wife ordered the shrimp tacos and they were pretty tasty. The shrimp was cooked nicely so it had that little bit of firmness on the outside, and the sauce that it was served with was a good, and a tad spicy. I ordered the babyback ribs smoothered in their beer-infused bbq sauce. Chili's ribs are the best ribs I've ever had at a chain restaurant and these were no different. They were succulent and tender and down-right delicious. I also enjoyed the sauce which was sweet yet had a bit of a bite to it. I also had the mashed potatoes and they were nothing to right home about...just dry, tasteless lumps.   Is Chili's my ideal dinner location? Heck no, but it was the best option on that stretch of 74. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again, but if I ever find myself heading back home from the in-laws again and this place happens to come up around supper time, I won't hesitate to stop in again."}
{"text":"Great food and service excellant very pleased i like ice tea great flavor Staff was super couldnt beat the service"}
{"text":"Service was very slow tonight, we got a table right away, but food was not coming out of the kitchen. Drink refills very hard to come by."}
{"text":"I have to say that this was the worst food that we have ever had at this franchise. Our server was attentive and on top of things. We never had to ask for anything. However the food was horrible. We decided to grab a quick bite after running errands with our little one. The food was just bad. We live in the area but we will never go back.    I also hate when cleaning products are left out on tables next to you while you eat..... For the entire time."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times and they are always on the ball whether it be lunch or supper.  We were crunched for time as my husband had to go to work.  They brought out our supper and appetizer quickly.  Try the cajun chicken pasta.  Absolutely one of my favorites...along with the southwest eggrolls."}
{"text":"There was more than 1/2 hour wait for a simple salad and soup order plus a child's menu pizza. The \"bottomless\" salad never had an offer of a refill.   The server was nice but it was a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Great food as usual. Gave 4 stars because service could have been better. Server only came back once after we paid because I had to flag her down for a box. My girls had kids meals and they loved them. Hubby has the sunrise burger (amazing) and I had Chicken Avocado Bacon sandwich (so good - too much for 1 person). We will be back just hope the next server is more attentive."}
{"text":"Even with a party of six, we were accommodated quickly. The waitress and support staff were attentive, friendly and kind. Special requests were taken in stride and splitting check was easy at the table kiosk.   Will be back again and again ..."}
{"text":"We received the worst service I have ever gotten at any restaurant.  first off, they were slow, it was 4:30pm when we got there.  the hostess was told by the waitress to wait to seat us until she caught up....really?  we were seated after 10 minutes.  we ordered water, an appetizer and a child's item for our 5yr old son.  We were there to support our local church fundraiser.  Our waitress, who I didn't get her name (heavy set African American ) did not come back to check on us.  I had to flag down another waitress to ask for dip.  no water refills.  our waitress did come by to let us know to checkout on the table top device.  which we could not do since we were paying cash.  we continued to wait to see if she would bring us a receipt, nope.  so we once again had to flag down the other waitress and give her our cash to pay our bill.  she brought back our change.  The service unfortunately was so bad we will not come back to this location.  aweful.  this woman should not be a waitress. anywhere."}
{"text":"Very helpful and friendly staff. Me and my friends got great service. Good food. Even a picky eater like me can find something on the menu."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here often bc we can't get enough of those fajitas! And usually the service is meh and drinks are slightly watered down but whatever we look young enough that it's expected. However, last night, our server, Sarah blew us away! She was immediately so warm and inviting. Even tho she was busy we never felt rushed or ignored. And when I asked if the bartender could make a drink that wasn't on the menu she made it happen. It's not often that I find great service. And even less that I would post about it but Sarah B deserves some recognition. She really made our dining experience wonderful."}
{"text":"The only reason I went there was because IHOP was far and I was starving. I walk in the restaurant and the guy that was sitting people was rude so I just told him I would sit at the bar.I order boneless chicken wings and a california chicken flatbread pizza the food was okay. I got to my hotel room feeling sick. I will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Every single time I have gone here they have under cooked my food (noticeably) and sent me home sick. The wings are the worst. Taste like they dip them quickly in till they \"think\" they're cooked.  It must be in their cooking because this isn't the only location. Its a great place to get a nice cleaning. If you catch my drift."}
{"text":"They are friendly, but not very clean. The bar was so slow, but the counter was dirty when we arrived and stayed that way. We sat in a booth and watched the staff just ignore it for the 45 mins it took to dine.  We probably should have left instead of eating there. But our food was decent and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"The experience we had here the other night was abhorrent. It took *literally* 45 minutes before our waiter would come to table. I kept having to flag down the hostess for service and she kept saying she'd go get the waiter over and over and nothing. Finally he shows up 45 mins later seemingly on something. He was very agitated and anxious, twitching and sweating. We ordered drinks. Beer glass was HALF empty when brought to us and the beer was room temperature. So we asked for a different one and it never came and neither did the waiter ever come back. So we were then left with no choice but to get up and leave. What a waste of time. 1 hour sitting at Chili's to flag down service that would never come. What an embarrassing reflection on their company. Never returning."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars I would. This was our FIRST time here. The snotty hostess was the first to greet us. She sat us and we sat there for about 15 minutes... no one even came over. My husband had to ask her where our server was (mind you, it's a Monday night and the place is dead), and the hostess told him HE was coming. A few seconds later a woman server started walking towards us... as we were getting up to leave. She looked utterly shocked that we were leaving. Upon leaving my husband asked the hostess why not offer us drinks during the wait... she says \"I'm not allowed\"... lol, okay. He asks for the corporate number to which the manager says they no longer have a number for them. Well, we left... and and won't be returning. Two thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Went on Superbowl Sunday, was treated very well. Had the presidential margarita and a long island. Food was yum as well"}
{"text":"Service was good but the chefs cant cook for shit. The chicken was barely cooked and my dad ordered a medium rare steak that came out raw."}
{"text":"We arrived at 8:30pm we were seated right away. There was probably 10-12 table's occupied and at least 6-8employees. Are server was there quite fast but he was the only server for the family side we ordered are drinks and came back and spilled it on me. Then he came back TOO take are order. We ordered the 2 for 22 and one cheese burger meal. For are appetizers we got the flower tortilla chips with guacamole and salsa the chips left a bad after tast like they were frayed in old oil. Then we got are meals I had the beacon burger and the waiter didn't even ask how I wanted it cooked so it was well done hard like a hockey puck. It came with fries the were cooked in same oil. The wife order the chicken crispers fried in same oil AGAIN after taste. She also got corn on the cob not bad. Her meal came with the same horrible fries. My mother in law ordered a cheese burger over cooked andvwaiter did not ask how she wanted her burger cooked came well done. She also got the fries. We asked for manger and he said he would take off the fried food off the bill since we did not eat it and offered us free desert. Well come TOO it he charge us for one and gave us two then when we got the bill it was still 30.00 and I still have that taste in my mouth shame on you guys should have comped the meal and told us TOO come back TOO try the place AGAIN. Hated It"}
{"text":"Bartender: Fred (barely slinging drinks, more paying attention to the hockey game)  4 beers, 3rd beer the guy gives me a glass with lipstick and other smudges of grime on it) To my admission, I didn't notice until 4 or 5 sips in and try to be discreet about this clown giving a beer in a dirty glass.   Fred, we're not asking you to sling quality/signature mixed drinks.  Obviously beers in a clean glass is a tall task for this old fella.    ***Steer clear***"}
{"text":"Poor service. I sat at the bar and watched as many as four servers getting there own drinks. I had no trouble getting a beer and a menu. Everything went down hill from there. Ordering food was not very easy. Soup and salad should be easy yes? Nope first was told it was extra after four pm even though I waited since 3:45 for a bar tender. Ok fine get my food no salad dressing. I could go on and on but you get the picture. I was a every weekend customer stopped last year. See you next year."}
{"text":"So between AppleBee's, TGIFridays, and Chili's.. Chili's takes the ball with this one.  They added a Margarita Meal Deal for $35 which consists of their regular dinner for 2 options, but now they've added on margaritas! They give you the option to upgrade to their presidente margarita which I suggest you do because it is uh-maz-ing.   The main reason why me and my boyfriend love Chili's is primarily for their texas cheese fries. The combination of fries, cheese, bacon bits, and jalapeños that makes our mouth salivate. As for my entree, I almost always opt for their chicken cajun pasta.  This meal deal also includes strawberry cheese cake which speaks for itself so need I say more?  All in all, I would definitely choose Chili's over AppleBee's and TGIFridays anyway."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my steak and chicken fajitas and happy hour all day on a Sunday is awesome. $3.5 house Chardonnay."}
{"text":"I too am sorry to say that this used to be one of our favorite places to eat ( 1-2 times a week), but tonight was the last straw.  This is now the third time we left disgusted.The service was so horrendously bad that we left before receiving our main dish. (Main dish was a salad and an appetizer). Our waitress blamed it on the \"bathroom situation\". WTH! An hour and a half with no food.  We were hungry so we tried wait it out, but had to leave when she said it would be another 20 mins. Totally Unexceptable. Will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Obviously chilling waiting for a flight. The food at chillis is kinda standard boring American food, but I must say the service was spot on the girl (who was also pregnant) that was serving us was very attentive and was great at making good food suggestions! Basically if your stuck in an airport terminal it will do in a pinch!"}
{"text":"whomp whomp. ordered chips & salsa and other appetizers to-go over the phone for a game night I was hosting. I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  So 20 minutes later, I came to pick it up and was told by a server that she would check on my food. she never came back to even tell me if the food was ready or not. I could see food in a to-go bag on the counter that looked like it could be my food.  I waited 10+ minutes and just left.  they never called to follow up so obviously they don't care too much.  The reason I'm giving two stars is because I have ordered to-go on other occasions and gotten (slightly) better service."}
{"text":"If you're hungry there aren't many choices at this end of the terminal.  I ordered a cheeseburger and fries and got a small tub of pickles with it.  It was filling but small for $14.10, but sufficient.  There are a few plugs for charging as well at the booths.  I did feel rushed along though."}
{"text":"Restaurant review Lunch combo time 6-7-8, quite inexpensive but I can't say that I was particularly enthralled by the food. I was shocked to see people take a few bites of their food and just leave it. It must have been that bad I guess. I ended up with the loaded baked potato soup that was somehow cold... Bacon Avocado Chicken Sandwich followed which I was shocked to see that it was half size for the lunch special. Very thinly cut avocado. All and all this was a below par meal. On top of that our server was not all too friendly trying to upsell drinks which we did not want. She came twice once to drop the food off and once again to bring us the bill.   Pro: lunch combo for cheap  Cons: below average food, I had cold soup...  Hidden gem:  Dinner promo 2 for 20 deal Sign up for email alert to deals and coupons, birthday free dessert"}
{"text":"Good service but very disappointed with the food at this chilis, I got chicken tenders and they were more like half cooked pieces of chicken/ some sort of weird  meat and breading that was salty, soggy and fell off when I tried to eat. Our waiter was really nice but for 10 dollars the plate of food I got was ridiculous and the only thing I ended up eating was corn on the cob and some fries. Don't get the chicken crispers (my friend had a really good salad though)"}
{"text":"Do NOT go to this Chili's location. The service has been consistently HORRIBLE.   A couple of weeks ago my boyfriend and I tried to call in an order. The guy answered and left us on hold so we decided to go ahead and head that way while we were on hold. Well....we were LITERALLY on hold for 17 mins and were STILL on hold when we got there.   We walked in and not a single soul greeted us. The same waitress looked at us and didnt say anything 3 different times. So...we sat down and waited on someone to greet us. A guy finally came over and asked if someone had assisted us yet. We asked for a manager. (Before the guy came over...another couple with their kid came in and stood there and NO ONE greeted them either. we told them we had been waiting 10 mins and no one greeted us so they walked out.)  The manager finally came over and we showed her the phone screen (yes, we were still on hold). She apologized and cooked our food for us and gave it to us free, drink included.  Ok so we went again this past Tuesday evening and it wasn't very crowded. My boyfriend placed the order again and asked to subsitute shrimp for broccoli in our pasta because we are vegetarians. We got there, 5 mins after they said our food would be ready and it still wasn't ready. We got our food and left (shouldve listened to my intuition telling me to check the food). Got to the house....our pasta was dry as hell and the \"steamed\" broccoli was raw broccoli sitting on top of our pasta. NEVER AGAIN. I'm disgusted with this place. The 2 stars was only because the first time they messed up the manager cooked the food very well."}
{"text":"I came in for a dessert and coffee with kahlua. My boyfriend ordered a margarita and chips and salsa. The chips and salsa never showed up. The coffee came out bitter, and tasted extremely burnt. I advised my server who reassured me she had made a fresh pot. I chose to forgo the coffee. The manager then came out and offered to water down my coffee since it was so black.  I couldn't believe that I was offered water to dilute my coffee! I haven't been to chilis in many years and now I remember why."}
{"text":"I don't know why this chili's location has mediocre reviews.  I have had nothing but good experiences here.  Great, helpful staff.  All the food I have ever ordered here has always been delicious."}
{"text":"Airport restaurant food... never too impressive and just like this restaurant. They are just trying to pump out the bar and food.  Service took a little long. I ordered the Margarita Grilled Chicken which was a low calorie item, didn't  want to feel bloated on the plane. Food quality was below average, the chopped tomato on top of the chicken was really cold so when I bit into it I thought the chicken was raw. The chicken was really small. Way more rice than meat. Flavour, there wasn't  much to it but make sure you squeeze the lime into it to add it some acidic taste or else it is bland."}
{"text":"Went for dinner, first received a plastic mug of soda that had mold around the top where the plastic was cracked. Sent it back and had to get someone other than our waiter to have the waiter bring my replacement soda 15 minutes later. Then we ordered endless enchiladas, 1st order came out after about 15 minutes reordered a second time and waited almost 30 minutes. Saw our waiter twice during our stay. Manager said they were short on help because one girl had to leave because of a family emergency. Sounds like this place depends on this one person to run smoothly."}
{"text":"Food was disgusting my loaded potatoes with my ribs were dried and cold. Fries were too salty I do not recommend this place. I am very upset."}
{"text":"Meehh...this place is aiight. Came here for happy hour only to be disappointed by their limited selection. Even the beers are are scarce. If I were you, I would walk across the lot and go to Fridays. At least they have IPA there."}
{"text":"Chili's:  Cleaning your bowels with gringo Tex-Mex since 1975.  My brother, Simon W., is making me write a review so here I am.  What can I say about Chili's?  Well starters, Simon's Black Cherry Lemonade was indeed delicious.  It tasted like a liquefied Pixie Stick.  I didn't have his artificial coloring problem though [read his review(s) if you want to read about going number two] but then again, I mainly drank water that night.    I got the Skillet Queso appetizer to share with the table but if I were honest, I ate like 90% of it.  If you were to melt some Velveeta, mix in a can of chili, add a little lime, sprinkle in some cumin, throw in some chili powder, and add a dash of cayenne pepper, you would have Skillet Queso.  They do serve it with some decent salsa and some Cantina style chips so it becomes highly addicting with each salty cheesy bite.  My brother got the loaded potato soup which looked more like cheese in a bowl and Wilson got the fajitas.  Who can go wrong with fajitas?  Anyways, this Chili's is pretty much like the rest.  The place was clean, the service was alright, and we paid at that at-table kiosk thing.  Chili's is an A-OK place!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable and filling dishes. If you're looking for foods that will blow your socks off then you're in the wrong place. Good for a quick bite except the wait can be a bit frustrating on the weekend so try to come on another day if you want quick!"}
{"text":"This Chilis used to be one of my favorite places to go eat, the food & service used to be on point but our last few trips here have been less than satisfying. For one, the place was a wreck- dirty tables everywhere, napkins on the floor, etc. Waited 15 mins for a table, probably because they were all dirty. Our waiter was nice, but couldn't get our order right. The table next to us ended up getting up and leaving. Very disappointed in this place now"}
{"text":"So they forgot the avocado on my chicken bacon avocado sandwich. And what is with this split your check pay at the table kiosk nonsense? Sooo annoying. Chili's sucks this is why I haven't been to one in almost a decade and why I probably won't come back to one for another decade."}
{"text":"Chili's was one of my choices for my birthday week and they did not disappoint for this visit. We tried their 3 for $10 deal. I enjoyed both my appetizer and entree. I ordered the Loaded Baked Potato soup and Cajun Chicken Pasta. I was skeptical with the pasta because the name sounded like a fish I had in a CA Chili's. Well this was delicious. Oh can't forget the garlic bread. It was just right. I can't forget our server. April is the best. She is friendly and attentive. Very good experience. I didn't give 5 stars because we were sitting very close to the kitchen and had the smell of \"something burnt\" coming our way. Food and service was great."}
{"text":"My wife and I come to this Chili's location often.  It is a great place for Happy Hour, make sure you sit in the bar area for their specials.  The staff here is amazing, we've probably been 20+ times and haven't had a bad experience.  It's a fun place, this is our go to when we are struggling on a decision for dinner.  We eat out all of the time so we come here a lot!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Chili's for years and couldn't remember why.  Got a gift card and decided to try it again. Tried the smothered prime rib burrito, which is a new menu item.  The burrito was 80% rice, with a small amount of meat. The enchilada sauce on top was not good enough to save the day.  The wife got some kind of smoked chicken stuffed quesadilla.  It came with no salsa or hot sauce and was very bland.  Add two soft drinks and tip and this was over $30.  I could have done better at Taco Bell for less than  $10.  Now I  remember why it's been years since I've been to Chili's."}
{"text":"I ordered the wild berry iced tea and mango...juice? The result is it sucks! The juice tastes sour and a little bitter. I could bearly find out my drink is actually fruit tea except for the color. Apart from that, the waiter made us feel like he wants us to leave as soon as possible cuz we just ordered two drinks at midnight. He kept asking us if we want to order more and before I ask him for the bill he just put it on our table."}
{"text":"Was already annoyed with my day. Was explaining it to the other two people in my party, eventually it turned into a rant.  The Restaurant was not very busy but there was a family seated behind us, well they asked to be moved over my loud voice, which is completely understandable. What killed it for me was the \"talking to\" I was given by some other waitress because the family had asked to be moved. 9pm on a Sunday and I can't speak my mind at the table, no. I couldn't have fathomed being more angry when I left than when I had came in.   How was food?  It was alright at best.  How was the service?  Slow as hell for how slow the restaurant was.  Did I leave a tip? Only because one of my party members is a server.   Will I go back? No  Will i recommend this location to anyone? No  The only lesson to be learned here is don't let another server talk to your table negatively, it could cost you your tip."}
{"text":"We sat at our table for over 15 and never got so much as a hello from a server.... So we left!"}
{"text":"It was the little guys choice today and he wanted Chilis. Mainly for the games they have at the table. Its 1.99 and there are a ton of games. Service ( I cannot remember her name!! Ugh...sounds like Candace, Chalice, Carla, Chandra, Charlize????) But it was great, I thought. We got our app fast, which were the cheese curds and the lunch specials were awesome. I had the mini burgers on soft buns with onions and pickles (I didn't like the pickles) and it came with fries and a cup of soup. Soup was loaded baked potato and was hot and delicious. E got the mac n cheese kids meal. It came with choice of drink and side. He got mandarin oranges. It was just Kraft mac n cheese but he loved it. We had a great time, service was great and food was decent enough. We may come back!"}
{"text":"It took a while to seat my party of 6..  but once that happened our server Sean was fantastic. He apologized for the wait and got our drink/food orders in right away. He was so friendly and helpful even when my food came over with something I didn't like (I am a picky eater and my food came with tomatoes). He got it switched out for me right away! I've never had a bad experience at this chili's... I don't know where all the bad reviews come from."}
{"text":"We go out a lot and most of the time it's good but I think lately customer service has dropped. Maridith the manager here did horrible as customer service as well. We had the rewards before with your phone number and I get coupons every month for free chips and salsa but it's never at the time I am going or I delete the e mail. And I asked the server about the ones I found online and she said nope this won't work because it has to have a bar code but you know management can always over ride this. We spent some time finding one with a bar code. And could not so we asked for Maridith and she came over. Not helpful at all. Just said how the new systems for the rewards has changed and if I can't find my account to create a new account. And went on why how this is because the old system only gave you so long to use your points anyways and they's why we should create a new account. Still not working with us to figure out how to get the free chips and salsa. Anyways we complained after just saying hey that's bad customer service and she did it say much but sorry and I ased about where I can review and she said oh it was on the thing on your table where you paid. Really come on.... waitress never asked us if we were thirsty again we only had seen her to order and get our food. And I had to find her to get the bill"}
{"text":"I go here all the time because my picky eater friend loves to eat here.  She always gets the same two dishes and I just join her.    The Old Time Burger:  Just a normal burger, but the fries are seasoned nicely.  Great for a picky friend.    Sirloin Steak:  I enjoy this as well. I had this in medium rare, and I did not get sick.  The seasoning on it makes it tasty and my picky friend likes it.    Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie:  So sweet that it makes one of my sensitive teeth have pain, but man it's delicious.  Margherita Flatbread:  I was not a fan of this.  It tasted unhealthy and the flat bread had a texture I did not enjoy.    Brownie Sundae:  It's just normal.  Ice cream and a brownie.  Molten Chocolate Cake: Very sweet, but good.  Due to it's sweetness, I can only handle eating about 6 bites. I recommend sharing it with a friend.  Here is a little tip:  If you sign in with foursquare, sometimes you can get a free appetizer or nachos. :)"}
{"text":"Only eat here if you have 3 hours. It took 20 minutes to see a server and we ordered immediately. 45 minutes into the wait for a burger, I asked them to box the order so we could board our flight. Most of the order was wrong, all of it was cold, and no one apologized. For an airport location, I would expect service in under an hour. Not the case here."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices. Decent variety of menu options. Clean, comfortable atmosphere. Can earn some Plenti points to boot.   Love the skillet chocolate chip cookie!"}
{"text":"My kid and I came here for dinner. We were seated immediately and drink orders came quickly. My son got exactly what he wanted, pepperoni pizza, corn on the cob, and Diet Coke. He was extremely happy with it, ate everything (which he usually doesn't do). I ordered the 6oz sirloin, skillet mashed potatoes, fries, and Diet Coke, which all tasted pretty good.  The reason I gave three out of five stars is because the steak was very well done rather than medium, which is what I asked for, and I was never once offered a refill despite finishing my drink about halfway through my meal. Additionally, the bill was $21.25, I gave $30, and my change was exactly $8. My waitress rounded 25¢ up to the nearest dollar and gave me the remainder after that. Not cool. Of course I planned to tip, and I DID, but she shouldn't hold back the better part of a dollar based on the expectation of a tip. Let me make up my mind about exactly how much to leave.  All in all, an okay experience with disappointing moments."}
{"text":"Weekday lunch special. Turkey club and southwest chicken tortilla soup. Both were adequate. Grapefruit margarita was nasty and it was $9.00 for non premium tequila. Shame on me, would not have ordered if I paid more attention. Hubby had the 2 bites and chill again nothing special but filling  Service was good and quick enough"}
{"text":"Went for lunch had the 1/2 order Texas Cheese Fries they were served in a cast iron skillet topped with bacon and jalapeño. Excellent choice  my Husband had a huge Turkey avocado sandwich and he loved it . The waitress was fast friendly and refilled our drinks efficiently . Very happy experience. We did use the game play on the table and were surprised they charged us 1.99 live and learn . All and all a great time"}
{"text":"I like the food but theres a bartender in the middle of the day always seems irritated to be working and this kind of ruins the experience for me... yes, its a chain restaurant I get it... but at least pretend to be happy to be working. Other than that I've had pretty good service."}
{"text":"I am giving them three stars, only because our visits in the past weren't that bad.  Our most recent visit however, was terrible.  Our food took FOREVER and when we finally got it, my husband's burger, which was ordered \"well done,\" was raw in the middle.  After waiting over an hour to get our food, he sent it back and refused any type of replacement item as offered by the manager.  Simply terrible service and food quality this time around.  We did visit the Henderson location the week after and overall the quality of food and service was better than this one, but I am sad to say that I think Chili's will be placed at the bottom of our options list going forward; despite the Manager's best effort to help with comps."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while can't believe I've never checked in. It's the kind of restaurant you can go in normal wear and eat fresh food. The wait staff is nice and I have also felt with the Togo side of it too. I hardly have to wait on my food. I prefer to sit on the bar side where setting is more relax. Prices are not bad. Haven't had one bad experience. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Love coming here! Wanted to say thank you for always having your amazing bartender Shannon making us feel at home.  Great service and fun deals"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have had Chili's many times in the past and have always had great service and awesome food. Well tonight we had Ok service and very low quality food. The French fries that came with my husbands Boss burger which was mediocre and was lacking flavor tasted stale. I order the chicken and shrimp fajitas and chicken tasted like previously frozen processed chicken the shrimp also very rubbery so I ordered a plain old cheeseburger. The burger came out first without fries because they were not done yet and the burger was raw on the inside. I was so disappointed with the meal and will not plan on going back for some time. At least not to this location."}
{"text":"They clearly don't care about their customers. We used to frequent this location often a few years ago and everything was great. I'm not sure if management changed or where it started going downhill as far as service. Last visit was a few weeks ago, not only did it take a good 30 minutes for our drinks (it wasn't even busy and our appetizers came first)... we did a Postmates tonight and even spelling it out for them they didn't get our order right. Not sure how much easier we could've made it for them but definitely not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Pretty surprised by how their new Mexican food offerings were. Very tasty sour cream enchilada. I thought it'd be served with a red sauce and topped with sour cream but it was served with a yummy creamy cheese sauce. It wasn't too gloppy with cheese, either. Shredded chicken, citrus lime rice and black beans were flavorful and good, too.  I was disappointed by how few items are available gluten-free. Even their corn chips are blended with gluten flour. I took a risk and ordered the enchilada & taco nonetheless and hope I won't be sick later from it!  There are plenty of main dish and side dish options on the kids menu. My daughter's side of fresh pineapple was inedible, though - just way too unripe. The waitress happily provided an alternative side at no extra charge."}
{"text":"Waited extremely to long for a server. Everyone just walked by never even attempted to approach the table.Then finally got seen by a server,waited even longer for 2 waters and a kids soda.Not coming back.You guys SUCK."}
{"text":"Do not get a drink from here unless its half off $$$  they literally give you ALL ice and when you let the manager know she says its standard policy. . Be ready to pay $8.99. For a tall glass of ice with a splash of juice . If u complain they might take 1/2. Off the tab but they will not remake it. She offerd to add some sour juice.. i gave a 2.  Star only because my food was some what good."}
{"text":"Been eating here since there's not much restaurant in North Las Vegas.  However, after eating lunch here  few days ago with my girls I don't think we will return.  We ordered appetizers and we asked for small plates so we could share the Texas cheese fries. When the waitress brought the small plates, we noticed they were filthy!  There were dried food crumbs on both the top and bottom of the plates (ewww)!  It was so disgusting because it looks like the plates weren't wash well.  So we asked for another set.  Then when I opened the sets of utensils , I noticed dried food in between the forks. Yuck!  By this time I have lost my appetite.  To top that the waitress that served our entrees was unfriendly and just shoved the plates on the table even though we had no room in front of us!  How rude is that?!  She should've taken our small plates since we were done with the appetizer.  It seems like she was unhappy with her job or something!  We were very disappointed and will not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"It would have been nice to get alcohol in our margaritas. Had the chicken fajitas.  Very bad. If its not a Mexican restaurant don't order mexican food. Very true here.  The staff were very attentive."}
{"text":"Walked into here just before 2pm and every table in the bar area dirty.  Had to wait 15 minutes for a table in the restaurant.  No wait staff on Cinco de mayo. Only special is Margarita and dos xx draft. Place is freezing cold.  They still do free chips and salsa in the bar area only. I guess if there is a place to sit. Lol.  The California chicken flat bread was good. And the triple dipper was filling also. . Over all not very excited to go back.  Ready to leave @330 and still have dirty tables in the restaurant that have been dirty since we walked in.The bill took 45 minutes to correct ."}
{"text":"Newly remodeled and much brighter inside. The service was friendly and helpful.  The chips, salsa,  and guacamole were tasty. We both got the mex bowl without chicken, cheese, or sauce. The menu is not very vegetarian/vegan friendly so that keeps me from giving 5 stars."}
{"text":"Way too much fat, saturated and trans, in the burger.  Fries tasted funny.  What was in that cooking oil?  Redneck atmosphere."}
{"text":"First off Thank you for some vegetarian options on your menu. Blank bean burger & Cheese enchiladas are just a few. Also TV screens. Nba Nfl are my faves. The Gson is kept entertained with the game console. It allows me & his mom to drink & chat lol. Margaritas are pricey as if we were on the strip."}
{"text":"I wasn't even going to write a review. I actually never do. However..in the 17 minutes I've been waiting for my vodka tonic I decided to let loose. We came in bc it's across the street from our hotel. Margarita tasted like chemicals. Thursday night 9pm..maybe 30 people here. We've had 3 waitresses and it kinda smells like a frat house. I won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"The services was decent.  The food was terrible.  We ordered the cheese fries app and the cheese was so hard that it broke the fries when we tried to eat it..."}
{"text":"This place is pathetic.  It was as if our server was annoyed that we were there at all.  I've never seen it take so long to get my first beer.  Hello?!  Hint: the people who eat and drink tend to have higher tabs, and higher tips!  Food was mediocre and not quite the same as regular Chilis.  Menu was abridged as well.  I thought I was eating on one tier above the sketchy fast food places in the terminal but apparently this place is no better... they just have alcohol and a server that you have to tip."}
{"text":"Bartender service is friendly.  All day drinks happy hour prices is nice.  Free chips and salsa during afternoon happy hour is good.  Other than that, it's like any Chili's.  Don't mind spending my free gift cards here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was a laid backand inviting.There was plenty of room in the bar area.  There were two people at the bar even though it wasn't packed.  The parking was great as well.  The staff checked on me twice within a five minute period.  Happy Hour is from 3-7 Monday thru Thursday and 9 to close.  Fridays 3-7 and Sundays all day... Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Ordered a cup of the chili and the steak fajitas.  The quality was consistent with other Chili's I've eaten at in the past.  Nothing spectacular but then nothing terrible either.  The atmosphere is typical of the chain, and kept clean enough.  The only downside was the waiter.  He messed up the drink order by bringing a Corona instead of the Blue Moon and included the up sell beans and rice, which I had told him I didn't want at time of order.  Both mistakes seemed to be intended to get the ticket price up to increase his tip."}
{"text":"It's Chili's which means it tips out at three stars, but in this ones case it is small with slow service. Better to wait in line at Burgatory..."}
{"text":"Been here for lunch a few times.  Today was exceptionally disappointing.  We asked to be seated in a location with a little more privacy, suggesting a table.  After the hostess seats us, we wait for 5 mins while servers buzz around all the other tables.  My friend decides to go up to the hostess area to let them know we'd actually like to get served in this century.  We order the 'Bottomless Soup & Salad'.  It comes with bland tortilla chips & some decent pureed salsa.  The tortilla & baked potato soups are cream based, so it's pretty rich.  The house salads are ok but nothing to brag about.    The best thing about this place was our assigned server Jeff.  He was extremely apologetic about the 'rocky start' as he called it.  Our food came out within minutes of placing our order & I think he checked on us @ least 6 times.  We really appreciated his effort despite the food quality."}
{"text":"I like this Chili's! It's close to home and they make some really good cheese burgers. Margarita's aren't bad either. The downfall here is the staff can be a slow at times and the location is a little small so it gets packed really fast. They could also use a better beer selection."}
{"text":"Since joining Yelp, I've been asking myself: am I a bad person? It must be true, because I actually sort of really like most chain restaurants.  Hmph.   Anyway, I was in the mood for steak but didn't want to pay a ridiculous amount, so a friend and I decided on Chili's. Maybe the service is lacking on weekends, but it was great on this Wednesday evening. We actually had 3 different servers checking on us, and hardly had to wait at all for anything.  We started with the soft pretzels. I didn't care for the queso but my friend really liked it. I had the sirloin with loaded mashed potatoes and broccoli. The broccoli was a little to salty/seasoned, but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Friend had the Cajun Pasta, which was delicious, but came out a little cold.  I also had some kind of tropical martini, I think. I can't remember the name, but it was tasty and on the strong side (mmm).  We split the Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie. Amazing.  Each table has a ziosk, where you can look at the menu, pay with a card, figure out the tip, and play games (there is a fee for the games!). I hope this doesn't eliminate restaurant jobs, but I really liked it...  Friend would probably give a lower rating because his pasta was a little cold. But I'm the one writing the review, so I say 5 stars. Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Always have enjoyed eating at Chili's but this location was not up to par. Ordered pick up for the margarita grilled chicken and when I returned to my office to eat it was surprised to find only 1/2 the regular portion in the box. -3 stars for value in my book. Will not be ordering pick up from here again."}
{"text":"went here after a movie. there were only a number of customers seated but yet it took a while to get our food; we only ordered appetizers by the way. we had the buffalo fried cauliflower, fresh guacamole with chips, and the margharita flatbread.   the fried cauliflower was actually good. i guess this is new in their menu. the guacomole is a miss. it felt lacking so we put a bit of lemon, salt, and black pepper on it to make it in to our liking. the flatbread tasted good but a bit burnt on the side."}
{"text":"I don't know why this restaurant has only 3 stars at the moment, but I've been to Chilli's in Maryland & this is the best location I've been to!   We have always had great service & the servers are all very nice & helpful.   The chips & salsa are the best.....EVER!   Try the smothered chicken burrito- it's DELICIOUS!! And it heats up really nice as well!   The grilled chicken sandwich is also good & always a safe bet!   The chocolate molten cake is so good- we brought it home & we wished we had one for each of us! Haha!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  The best chips and salsa in town.  The service was very good.  One of our favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Great service great food delicious choices and you can get a type of alcoholic drink but no alcohol which is delicious. I will definitely recommend to others and let them know how deliciously the food is."}
{"text":"Expect mediocore airport quality service and food choices. It's been a long time since I've been to Chili's and so I'm not sure if this is what one would normally expect from Chili's nowadays, but I remember my experience being quite different in the past. Service is moderately slow (so don't come if you are in a hurry for your flight). Menu is much more limited than as stated on Yelp. Food is expensive and they are chincy. I got all of 4 pieces of sliced (shouldn't it be shredded?) chicken breast on my nachos and a small dollop of guacamole, each for about $2 extra a piece. Music is irritating and loud. I haven't received the bill yet for my nachos and margarita but I'm thinking $30-35 not including tip. BUT this is in an airport and so considering the alternatives....this isn't bad. (If you look at the other Yelp reviews for McCarran, you'll notice similar low ratings for most of the restaurants). On the bright side, there is a full bar with 4 TVs, they let you stay a long time at your table without hurrying you, the service is not attentive but not neglectful either (I got a nice bowl of salsa when I asked for it), and  the seasoning on the freshly fried tortilla chips is TDF (is that an acceptable and understandable abbreviation?). Margarita is so-so which really sums up my experience here...."}
{"text":"My family and I frequent Chili's because kids like the food and I often have rewards.  There is 1 waitress who is the worst.  Her attitude is terrible.  We went yesterday for dinner there was 2 kids and 6 adults.  Our drinks take about 15-minutes to arrive to the table first off.  Then I get my food and one of the other waitresses accidentally puts her key in my soup, no big deal, I'll get a new one.  No, it's the waitresses, smart comment of, \"What's wrong with her soup?\"  In a bitchy tone, I tell her,\"her keys were in my soup.\"  My son squirts the ketchup and he gets some in his eye, yah I know, 6-year-olds.... anyways, I get up to get napkins because none were brought to the table.  What does the waitress say right behind me?  \"I was getting the napkins.\"  Yah well guess what lady, you're one ketchup squirt in the eye late for the napkins.  Did I complain?  Nope, that wouldn't change her bitchy attitude.  We had the same waitress the day before I gave birth and guess what?  She was still bitchy, probably in her nature to be bitchy, but I'm not paying for bitchy attitude, I'm paying for food and service.    2-stars given on the waitress, I like Chili's food, no complaints there."}
{"text":"Had the chicken, steak, & shrimp fajitas and it was DELICIOUS! DH fell in love with the spicy shrimp tacos. Server (Mandy) was quick, attentive, and friendly. We come here for the table-side guacamole and we'll be back again to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"For a place on LV Blvd this place is nice, even for locals. The service was great plus the food came pretty fast. I have been there a few times too during happy hour. Out of the 10+ times I have been there I have nothing bad to say at all. I also love paying at the table without having to deal with the servers.   Tip - Tell the server what you want and let them put it together for you. They always have specials and combination deals. They will be more than willing to help."}
{"text":"Normally, I wouldn't take the time to review a place like Chili's. We all know by now how unoriginal and uninspiring their menu is, and that Chili's is the Denny's of late night grub. Well, having said this, the reason that I'm reviewing Chili's today is to tell you about an interesting thing that happened to my bf and I when we visited this Chili's not too long ago.   First, shame on us for resorting to eating here, but it was a cold winter night and we didn't want to venture too far from home. There food is so forgettable that I honestly can't even remember what we had, I just remember that it wasn't that great. I think we had some sort of sliders and maybe some taco's that we took a few bites of and quickly got sick of.   The real reason that I am writing however, is to tell about a lame thing that happened to us when we visited (even lamer than the food). My boy and I were cuddling in a booth, his arm was around my shoulder and my hand was on his thigh. We were talking to each other and laughing to ourselves quietly, nothing out of the ordinary if you ask me. We had ordered a dessert and were eating that when all of a sudden the manager of the joint comes up to our booth and says, \"How's the dessert, let's keep it a family restaurant\". Before we could even respond, he was gone and we just turned to each other with a bewildered look for the next 5 minutes. We couldn't figure out what we had done, and the more we thought about it the madder we got. It's not like we were having sex on the table or touching each other inappropriately in the restaurant. We were simply sitting close to each other cuddling and eating our dessert. We were so mad that we blew out of that joint and left our unfinished dessert on the table. We have never been back and we probably never will since we do not want to eat in a place that reprimands you for cuddling and having a good time. If a family restaurant is anything like Chili's, then I never want to eat in a family restaurant again!  Keep it a family restaurant my ass, there's probably more drug deals that go on there than anywhere in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Chilis I've ever been to. Service is so-so. But in general employees are friendly. But at this place it's more of a shock if your food is actually good than it is bad. At yesterday's visit our queso was so thick it broke the chips. My little ones Mac and cheese was so overly microwaved it was stuck together in clumps and looked almost burnt. Bottom line if your going to pick a chain restaurant head across the street to Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"FREEZING in this restaurant. they have eliminated SO MANY appetizers.  my pretzel sticks were over cooked.  service is slow & there is almost no one here. probably won't return.  go to Applebee's instead."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've been to Chili's. I couldn't pass up the free flatbread coupon from Facebook recently, and it was amazing! I had the chicken, salsa, bacon, tomato, avocado flatbread and it was huge. I even got chips n salsa from the manager becuase the flatbread took a while. I would return to try another flatbread for sure!"}
{"text":"Got the 2 for $22.00 deal which was good. I have been here many times no problem this time the problem was the waitress. I don't know if she was new but.  We barely sat and she asked what we wanted to drink before we even looked at the drink menu. We got the nachos and had to ask for little dishes. I ordered the ribs she did not go over the sauces or the sides. She brings our meal and walks away and comes back not even 2 minutes and ask us if it was ok. She than continued to come every few minutes. Other than her the food was good"}
{"text":"This is a pretty busy location right off of Independence.  Went here on a Friday night and the hostess seemed a little lost and confused, but we managed to get a table right away (for 7pm).  I would call that early on a Friday, but still...  Our server came by and greeted us and took our orders.  Seemed like a lot of people were celebrating birthdays because we kept hearing the Chili's version of Happy Birthday being sung every 5 mins.  I guess that is why the food took forever to come out.  I wouldn't have minded, but I had the cajun pasta and it was.. okay - some of the pasta was overcooked.  Overall, not the best Chili's experience... maybe it was just a bad night.  This is one of those times where service really effected the food experience for me."}
{"text":"If you've been to one, you've been to them all. Though I will say, avoid this place at all costs on the weekend, it's a madhouse."}
{"text":"the food was good ...the service was great ....being in the biz the team work ....I never wanted .....but I wish my server hadn't put our check down so fast felt a bit rushed ....I will return definatly )"}
{"text":"Chili's really bailed us out on Christmas Eve. Our family of 36 people had reservations for Charleston's that evening. We arrived and Charleston's did not have our reservations. My son-in-law called Chili's, which was next door, and their manager was happy to accommodate us.  We walked over to Chili's and were so pleased to see that we were all able to be seated in the same area.  The good was very good and the waitstaff incredible!  We thank you, Chili's, for helping us all be together in Christmas Eve.  I think the manager's name was Vince. He was gracious and absolutely the best!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fun, friendly,  family atmosphere.  We have been here several times and the staff is very attentive,  good food and great service. We used the online reservation for a table and were able to get seated quickly. The server was great, my kids spilled a drink and he was right there to help clean it up. The manager delivered our food and checked on a several times to make sure things were okay. We will definitely be back and earn rewards while we were there. Sign up for the reward system and you can earn coupons and special awards for future visits."}
{"text":"I had a party of 7 to include two small kids.  Allie was our waitress and she was hands down the best server I've ever had in any establishment I've ever been to.  She was very attentive and super patient.  Brought drinks without asking if we wanted refills, was just an all around sweetheart!  Will be back because of her!"}
{"text":"Great spot to enjoy a reasonably priced meal and drink while waiting for your flight.  Food was fresh - enjoyed a burger and fries."}
{"text":"My roommate and I went here for lunch on a Sunday because our first choice was too crowded. It ended up being a great plan B. We got chips and salsa to start. My roommate got a burger and I got some tacos. The tacos were a new item on the menu. They had shrimp, pork, and chicken. You also had the option to mix and match. I went with two shrimp and a pork. The tacos were decent. The shrimp were called \"spicy shrimp\" but there was only one bite that I had that was spicy. Not sure what was in that mouthful but it was definitely spicy!! The food was decent but it felt like it was on the pricier side for a chain restaurant.   The new tablet on your table system is pretty cool. You can order a round of drinks right from your table without having to wait for your server to come back. They have tons of free games to play with your friends or keep the kiddos entertained. AND  you can pay your bill right at the table. You can even split it however many ways you want to right at the table. It's pretty awesome."}
{"text":"I come here often with co-workers as it is right down the street from out office... so it is an easy location to get to.    I am part of the Chili's email club which usually gives us a free appetizer. And it is quite easy to use, not coupon to print, you can use a QR code provided in the email.   The service is a usually pretty good, and the food is a chain restaurant, so it is pretty predictable as to what you are getting.   Overall, this is a very convenient, clean, and friendly location!"}
{"text":"So I've been to this location 3 times now and only once was decent...the first time it was super busy so I have it pass...the second time was good...food and service but nothing special...this last time...yea never again...was in the bar area for a drink and some appetizers...service was weak to put it nicely...waited 8-10 minutes to order and then waited 30 minutes for food...which had very obviously been sitting under a heat lamp...they did try to fix the order but really if the waitress wasn't so busy chatting with the table behind us then maybe the order wouldn't have needed to be fixed...even the fixed order wasn't that great. All in all I don't think I will be back..."}
{"text":"I like this location, but the speed during lunch leaves something to be desired.  Not a great place to eat if you have to be back at work - I'd recommend their to-go option instead.  Love coming here at night, I can't resist their chips and salsa!  Another must-try is the Grilled Shrimp Tacos. YUM!  If you're watching calories, they also have a lighter options section of the menu, and the Grilled Chicken Salad is great.  I've never had a problem substituting different sides from what is listed in the menu, so be sure to check out all of your options before ordering!"}
{"text":"When we walked in, we didn't even get greeted. The girl at the front was just staring at us expecting us to say something to her. So I did. Took about 20 minutes to sit down. Not too long. But then, service was super slow. It took forever to get our order taken as well as quite a while to bring us our food. The pasta was okay. But the mac and cheese was delicious. What killed me at the end of the night was the dessert. I love love love eating dessert and was so excited for the cookie with ice cream since our dinners were just okay and service was slow. Buuuuuut, the cookie was hard as a rock and the ice cream didn't taste that good. Wouldn't choose as somewhere to eat. Probably won't come back unless someone else wanted to go. Then I would know what to expect and suggest dessert somewhere else."}
{"text":"The commercials for 2 for $20 run incessantly, so we decided to stop in after a major shopping excursion to see what all of the fuss was about. However, when we finally got there, it was after 9PM...which meant that it was Happy Hour! Hence, we opted to order a variety of smaller dishes instead of going the 2 for $20 route.  Our visit started off on a bit of a rocky note. We sat down and ordered Happy Hour food and beverages, but the waitress soon returned to tell us that we couldn't order Happy Hour foods unless we were sitting in the bar area. I was both amused and annoyed by this; I've been to fancy, highly regarded establishments like Fat Cats, Lava Lounge, and the Bistro on Lincoln Park and been able to eat Happy Hour anywhere in the restaurant, and a nearly empty chain restaurant requires me to sit in the bar area in order to eat Happy Hour? Super, super lame.   The bar area was well designed, though. The TVs are hung low and tuned to a variety of different channels (I could have lived without the Fox News though, but that's just me) and it was nice to have a wide variety of viewing options. I felt surprisingly comfortable and relaxed and I could see myself hanging out there for hours watching sports while snacking on some nachos.  The food, though, left a bit to be desired. Pretty much all of our food was decent, but nothing was unique. My sliders were quite dry and they were assembled in a rather haphazard manner. It almost seemed like they were intentionally assembled in a manner that would minimize flavor. I would have asked them to be made medium rare, but I never had that option. I'm the last person in the world to complain about salt, but the fries were overly salty as well. I can't imagine how someone who carefully monitors their salt intake would feel! Also, our margarita was a bit small.   I can see myself going here again if I'm not up for eating something extraordinary or unique."}
{"text":"Poor customer service.   My co-workers and I came for lunch.  The soup was lukewarm - the cheese on top would not melt, which she sent it back.  We ordered the same lunch entree which included 4 quesadillas and fries.  My entree came out with 3 quesadillas.  When I questioned the manager he said \"oh that's the lunch portion\" however my co-workers had 4.  The manager then went back to the kitchen and came back with 1 quesadilla and then said it \"fell off the plate\".  Disgusting!  Where did you get the 4th quesadilla....he said he grabbed it off another plate!!!  This is the poorest customer service and service recovery that I've ever experienced.  I would not recommend this Chilis."}
{"text":"Over the years I have noticed that Chillis Bar and Grill food has gone downhill. They have changed their menu and got rid of some of my favorites. Service in this location was good, my husband and I were noticed by the employees and our server was attentive. Although, I can't give the food a better rating, we ordered our appetizer, I had a sirloin steak and my husband ordered the steak/shrimp fajitas, I had a taste of his dish. Even my molten lava cake wasn't as great as it used to be. The service made up for the  bland food.."}
{"text":"Tami, our server was unable or unwilling to provide a well-thought wine pairing so my dining partner asked to see the sommelier and was informed none such gentleman was on staff.   Ordered a Long Island Iced Tea instead and was unable to procure a label listing on the types and ages of the liquors used in its preparation. The ice seemed to have been made with unfiltered 'tap' water although, to be fair, I did not have it tested as the circumstance prohibited such thoroughness.  I ordered Big Mouth Bites hamburger sandwiches which were small. I did receive four of them on my plate and that hinted to me that plate size was dictating burger size. Since this menu item promised four hamburgers instead of a lesser quantity, it appears the proprietors opted to make them smaller rather than to increase the plate size.   I did not complain, I simply ordered more burgers and made sure that each was of a suitable size. The Hatch burger had canned chile peppers on it and it was the best of the lot. I took a lot of food home in a styrofoam container but discarded them into my neighbor's yard because the items aged poorly in the trunk of my car.  I considered disgorging and ordering a pizza but opted to let the meal stand as eaten and watched television. I spent this part of my evening alone which I attribute to my choice of restaurant or possibly my decision to speak with my mouth full. At times, smallish pieces of food were expelled onto the tabletop. My passion; my curse."}
{"text":"i came here tuesday 4/26 around 930pm for the email I received for $6 margaritas which was an awesome deal.. patron margaritas were included in the deal.. (yayyyyyy) only the bar area was open & that was right up our alleys.. the bartender/server seemed like he hated his job & wasn't friendly at all.. seemed like anything we asked for irritated him.. the 3 stars are for the margaritas & food.. Texas cheese fries were made to perfection & came out pretty quickly.. I'd return but ask for a different server if i sat in the bar again."}
{"text":"our food was BOMB DIGGITY. this was by far the best applebees experience i have ever had !! our waiter nolan was was great!!!"}
{"text":"Literally WHENEVER I go here the service is amazing!   See, I've only really started eating out places recently. That problem is that I've had trouble actually finding a place that I like. Some places have food that's too salty, some too bland, overseasoning is sort of rare- but it does happen! Chili's is the only chain resteruant I can go to knowing that I'll recieve quality service and food at a modest price!"}
{"text":"Chain restaurants exist for a reason. They are supposed to provide a consistent experience for a diner every time. That can be a very good thing. Chili's is a fine choice for a dinner with friends as long as you don't choose this location. It's like a bad reality show that is out of control. I was waiting for Gordon Ramsay to come in and kick a table over.   We went here for dinner before the traditional dinner rush started.  I suppose we should take some responsibility for not leaving during the long wait period it took for anyone to come to the table after we were seated. The next clue would have been when the server could not tell us what red wine choices they offer (it turns out the grand total is three). The next issue was getting salad and apps out in the correct order. I know; we ignored the clues and plunged ahead to our own dining demise.   My personal failure was to order a steak here. I should have known anything beyond a burger was a pipe dream. My medium rare steak came out medium well at best. I am not sure from personal experience what the consistency of the Beggin Strips that I buy for my dog are but this steak was certainly a contender when considering the chewy aspect. I asked for a replacement. The replacement came out inedible as well. The excuse for everything? A new cook.   All of the wait times here were unacceptable. The worst was the long wait to pay which is a personal hot button issue for me. When I looked at the check, I noticed that both steaks (which had gone unconsumed) were on the bill. They were eventually removed and that added more time to the wait. The drive thru at (insert restaurant name here) would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch last week with some work folks and the overall experience was very nice. For a chain restaurant, it isn't too bad at all!  We were greeted and seated right away. There were two folks taking care of as one of them was in training. She was doing a great job for being new on the job.   The food was really tasty. I went with a chicken salad. It came with grilled chicken on top and the chicken was excellent! Very flavorful and a nice portion. The others I was dining with seemed to enjoy their plates as well and we all left happy and full.   The pricing on the menu is very reasonable so this is an easy choice for lunch or dinner if you're looking for something filling that won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been to a Chili's in years before tonight. Came with a group tonight for a friend's birthday. Overall, it was a great time!   It was crazy busy inside. Lots of people waiting for tables but we had made a reservation. There were 12 of us at out table and we had one server - Ron.   Ron was awesome! He was running his tail off keeping us taken care of as well as his several other tables.   The food and drinks were all pretty darn good. The Tito's punch was fantastic! Dangerously delicious. The street corn was awesome. The chicken and avocado tacos were perfectly sized and definitely hit the spot.   Ron brought us two lava cake desserts to share amongst the table with birthday candles which was the perfect end to the meal.   Overall, it was a good experience and I think our server was fantastic. Kudos to Ron. Thanks for dealing with our large, multi-check, rambunctious group."}
{"text":"I have been to maybe over 25 different Chili's locations all over CA and NV. From my experience, some of the locations have decent service and some have very poor service. Many of the locations that have poor service staff their restaurant with \"hot chicks\" who have bad attitudes, but their good looks seem to keep the customers coming. I have been to some locations where I had to wait 10 minutes for a host to even put my name on the list, and I have also been to some locations where I never saw my server one time after she took our orders. So, I was not expecting much when I came to this Chili's near Aliante Station. I've lived in Vegas long enough to know that even the 5-star restaurants have bad service due to 1/2 the people here being jaded and sick of being alive. Well, I was very shocked to see how great the service was here. The host, and servers had very good social skills, were very friendly, and had great work ethics. I don't think I had one problem here at all.  Of course I left a giant tip."}

{"text":"Used curbside pick up for the 1st time. Not great. Nachos were soggy and seem to have been made a hour before pick up time. We were actually exactly on time for pick up but still had poor quality food."}
{"text":"We ate here on 1/4/18 and had a group of 9. Our server James was amazing! He didn't write down any of our orders, and let me tell you we ordered a lot with special requests and appetizers and drinks and he got everything 100%. The food came quickly, the kids were served first so they were happy and all of our food came at once. The food was delicious too. My husband and I were able to share the chicken fajitas and we still had half the plate left over. We also each got a side salad. Amazing service, amazing food. We will be returning."}
{"text":"I like this place. People are great. I love their ribs and I love their salmon. Their burgers are.good, to."}
{"text":"This is my second experience at Chili's. I wasn't very hungry, so I decided to try a small loaded potato soup. It was amazing, so fresh and tasty. The service was very quick too. The host at the door is welcoming everybody like in a 5 star restaurant. Excellent experience!"}
{"text":"We just had a wonderful time there tonight. Fast service at the bar ( ask for Jessica), great happy hour prices for food and drinks. They had the best guacamole sauce I have ever tried. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I used to come here for lunch after church every Sunday with my parents, but it's become very apparent that the lenders of this chain are trying too hard to modernize the place and make it more inviting. I came here with my girlfriend recently for a quick lunch date, only to find out that not one thing about this place is like it used to be. Their famous Cajun Pasta is practically hidden in their menu, instead of advertised like it used to be. The menu is all about their, again, famous baby back ribs and burgers and fajitas. My girlfriend and I decided to try their burgers because they were advertised very nicely, as well as some cheese curds for an appetizer. The drinks were a riot. We had ordered an Arnold Palmer and a mango iced tea. The mango syrup and iced tea were extremely layer, my girlfriend had to mix at it for a good ten minutes with her straw to make the drink bearable, and as for the Arnold Palmer, it was incredibly too sweet. There's a problem when your drinks get brought over and you can visually see the difference in color where the syrup is floating in the middle of the glass. The cheese curds was mozzarella, not even actual cheese curds, they were practically just bite sized mozzarella sticks. They were extremely salty and oily. The worst part was that they were better than the burgers we got. It took over an hour of waiting for two burgers. When our burgers came, they were just appalling. The yolk on the egg from my burger was already burst and had spilt out all over the plate, there was an excessive amount of oil, so much that at some point when my girlfriend took a bite of the bun, she had to run to the bathroom to puke it out because it tasted soggy and of just oil and grease. The one thing about the burger that was good was the meat, it was a cooked perfectly, it's a shame that the presentation and lack of care for their food destroyed the patty.

{"text":"I'm usually happy with food from Chili's (from what I remember).  This was the first time going to the Surprise location, and the meat was way overcooked.  Our waitress, Vicky, was very good and said she brought it to the attention of the GM but they offered no solution.  We did, however ask to change from the 2 pc to 3 pc dinner; when she brought the fresh piece of chicken, it was very good.  I again mentioned the ribs were like jerky; very dry and overcooked and the original piece of chicken was overcooked.  I gave ample opportunities to make me a happy customer and management didn't feel the need to visit my table or replace any of the overcooked meat.  Lesson learned, good or bad, I feel reviews are necessary to help businesses with customer service."}
{"text":"The food was good and came out quick. It's everything you would expect from a Chili's restaurant. The server was nice and the restaurant was clean looking. I would go again if I come out that way again."}
{"text":"My husband loves the Chicken Enchilada soup and the bottomless chips and salsa here. To recover from a cold and rainy weekend we decided to have a light dinner. After sitting at our booth without acknowledgement from any waitstaff someone finally approached out table. We finally ordered. He ordered the above with a Coke, I ordered a bowl of Loaded Potato Soup with a Mango Iced Tea. Our son ordered the kids Cheeseburger Bites with a bottle of root beer. Drinks took another 10 minutes and were delivered with our chips. Food came out about 10 after that.   My rating isn't based on the food, it was tasty  as always, and on par with your average Chili's. The 2 stars is based on service. After dropping off our drinks we never saw our waitress again. A random server brought out our food, which had already started to cool. Another minute and our soups would have been cold. Our waitress never returned to give us drink refills, never returned to see if our food was ok, never returned to see if we needed anything else. We saw her twice. Once when she finally initially greeted us and took our order since after sitting 15 minutes. Once when she dropped off our drinks and bottomless chips. (good thing we didn't need more chips. $7.99 for a basket of chips and a small cup of salsa)  I know we only ordered soup but our bill was still $29 without the tip.   Thank goodness for the check yourself out kiosk on the table or we probably would still be waiting for our waitress to find her way back to our table.  Next time we are in the mood for soup we will go across the street to Panera!"}
{"text":"Just had chilis to go, we ordered the shrimp and chicken fajitas a sweet and smokey burger and a full order of Texas cheese fries. Oh and bag of tortilla chips. Everything was good. Probably be much better if it wasn't take out."}
{"text":"I LOOOVVEE this place lol. Always excellent customer service and fantastic food. I especially love their Lighter Choices dishes on their menu. Also, a MUST try is their Quesadilla Explosion Salad. OMG its definitely an explosion because ITS THE BOOMBB! Forever one of my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Chili's is my go-to place when I don't want to spend a lot of money and I am not in the mood to get gussied up for a nice dinner.  That said, Chili's has raised their prices so many times in the last couple years that it makes me wonder \"Why do I ever go to Chili's?\"  I could spend less money at My Big Fat Greek Express or Cornish Pasty Company (or similar places) and be a lot more satisfied.    The one thing that keeps me coming back to Chili's, other than its proximity to the Chandler mall, is the chicken enchilada soup.  I also like their salsa.  The thing of it is, I have copycat recipes for both of those items that are spot on so... once again... why do I go to Chili's?"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for dinner before one of our shows and it was decent food but nothing amazing. The flatbread here was amazing and delicious! I'm a fan of the crunchy garlicy bread with the sauce they use. We also ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta over Alfredo sauce and the pasta was creamy but not flavorful. It tasted like the sauce was out of a can and not fresh. The Cajun Chicken was well seasoned and grilled. Our waiter was nice and friendly and even split our pasta dish in 2 seperate plates for us. This is not the most upscale place so my expectations weren't too high. I would only go back for the flatbread."}
{"text":"So I would say this place is nothing fancy just plaid old American food. We ordered there Cajun Chicken Alfredo Pasta which was okay but effeminately shareable. The sauce on the pasta was creamy and tangy but not that great. I did enjoy the grilled cajun chicken strips on top. It also came with some garlic bread which looked like it was the frozen kind just heated up. Our server was friendly and split our entree into two plates without even asking since me and my husband were sharing. We had also ordered the flatbread which was warm and delicious! It came with a drizzle of some cream sauce with garlic, cheese and basil. MMMM! I would only return here for the flatbread. Not too sure about there entrees though since I haven't tried them."}
{"text":"This is our favorite location, we've always had wonderful and attentive service and the food has been great. It's Chili's we don't expect a five course meal but it's a great spot to catch dinner or lunch. The bar drinks are inexpensive and usually pretty yummy, the bathrooms are kept clean and if you have any problem the managers are very quickly at your table to address it."}
{"text":"Had a pretty good visit. Our waitress was super nice and food was ok. Will likely come back"}
{"text":"Super friendly service at this location.  I wish the food matched up with the service.   I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich was nice until I took my second bite and it was raw inside.  While my server was nice enough to offer me another choice, I would have thought the manager would come out to apologize and offer a free or complimentary something.  Had I not looked at the product, I may have eaten raw chicken.    I ordered the quesadilla in its place. It was ok but the top of the quesadilla was separating.  Not typical.  Maybe not enough cheese?  Like I said, super nice service but product quality and food safety is a negative star!!"}
{"text":"I usually head here after work because I really enjoy the cheesecake. It fits my macros though lol. Anyways I always get the cajun chicken pasta with an extra 4 ounces of chicken. There were a couple times I paid for extra chicken but they didn't give me extra chicken :/ im a pretty understanding guy so I just dropped it. Next time I will check my order be for heading out.   Brennan (or Brandon the guy from Hawaii) he is awesome! Has great hospitality! Very nice guy! Keep it up buddy!"}
{"text":"I came to this location tonight for dinner with my boyfriend and the food was questionable without a doubt. I remember the crispy chicken being crispy and golden however we were serve doughy undercooked chicken. I ordered the fajitas and was given once again undercooked onions and bell peppers. I asked for them to be cooked a little more and almost 25 minutes later was given a plate scorching hot with burned peppers and meat. Even my rice was burned to the plate. I don't blame my server she was sweet and nice and my shitty food was not her fault, I just think the cooks in the kitchen should pay more attention to the food they dish out."}
{"text":"Got to love those flatbreads! Shame they stop doing fish tacos though. For that I am only giving it 3 stars. Do stop in often. Always pleasant staff and good service.   Update on service. Walk out twice due to bartender completely ignoring me. Once waited 5 minutes without an acknowledgment that I was there. Clearly the to go customers has priority.   This happened not once but twice. Doug the bartender should be fired. Will never go back there again. Bar service sucks."}
{"text":"Negative stars!! Didn't even make it in...waited to be seated for a while while the restaurant was 3/4 empty. Didn't see anyone working except the bar tender attending to a few people in the bar. Walked out!  I don't know how they stay open."}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time and I have to give it 5 stars. The dining room was clean, service was great, food was good and the prices were on point. We will definitely be back.  We had fully loaded boneless wings to start and they were out of this world. I had a loaded fajita with chicken, steak and shrimp (I probably won't get the steak again though). My husband had the guacamole burger with fries. We tried each other's food and everything was very good.  I signed up for their rewards program on the table app and I can't wait to start earning more!"}
{"text":"Had the Santa Fe salad.  Man, was it good!"}
{"text":"So, in general, this place was decent, clean, and the food was okay. Not great, but okay. I think my complaints are aimed more at the franchise than anything else - Chili's is just not what it was. Chili's used to be an American food restaurant with a southwest flare. Now, they have scrapped most of the American classics and are trying to be more of a Mexican food place... but not ENOUGH of one. No crispy taco shells, no refried beans. Only soft flour tortillas and more black beans than you can shake a stick at.  Which is fine... unless you are gluten intolerant and allergic to black beans.  And that leads me to another thing - stop telling me how you're burgers are hand made and cooked fresh and everything is certified organic. If you really want to impress me, have more gluten free options. Seriously, I don't care if you use free range chickens, if you are breading them with flour, that's kind of a no-go, and not very fair for large groups where you are bound to have people with dietary restrictions. Everything here has bread-ish stuff with a side of black beans. Sigh. I miss the old shrimp and potatoes with broccoli. Now, again, this is a franchise thing. Our server was nice, the table clean, and the food... fair enough. Just saying."}
{"text":"I don't know WHAT is going on in this kitchen any more. This location used to be my family's favorite, my Grandmother used to love the salmon so much she used to have us pick it up from take out every Friday. Lately, though, the food has been going downhill badly. We've not ordered from them for a couple of months, hoping things would improve, but they haven't. Tonight, I tried to order chicken crispers online, but was then given a notice that this location no longer serves  them. Fine, I ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta, asking that there be NO spice, extra tomatoes, and extra Alfredo sauce. My sister ordered a chicken salad,  my mother ordered the salmon with a side salad, and my Grandmother ordered the salmon with broccoli and rice. Only my Grandmother's order was correct.  My mother's salad was nothing but weedy looking lettuce on top of a sprinkle of cheese - what the heck is that? Where were the tomatoes? It was a weird inedible joke.  For my pasta, they apparently not only ignored my no-spice request, but they both cooked the pitiful and grisly chicken in it, and then dumped it in great chunks all over everything. Good thing I asked for extra Alfredo, because I had to wash it off. This is the third time they've messed up that spice. Perhaps the website should say this location can't not put the spice on. The worst, though, was my sister's salad. Apparently the Cajun spice had really gone overboard, because they also cooked her chicken in it, and also covered her plain chicken salad in it. It was absolutely disgusting. Also, when I went in to pick up the food, I could see right in to their kitchen. Funny, I wasn't allowed to order them, but before my eyes, I watched them make up two plates of chicken crispers.  Terrible service, food always screwed up, we're so done with this location."}
{"text":"Do not come here if you want fast service. A few teammates and I came here for a quick bite to eat, and we only had an hour. At 5:00 in the afternoon on a Sunday, it was pretty dead and we expected to get in and out quickly. After being seated, our waiter was no where to be seen. After 10 minutes, I was forced to notify the hostess that we had not been greeted by anyone yet. It took another 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive (2 sodas and a water), and they were not even correct. When our food came out, I was served an entire salad when I specifically said a side salad with my steak. After realizing his mistake when inputting the order (because he didn't write it down), my correct order was put in. By the time my steak was served to me, my friends had already finished and I had no choice but to box the whole thing up because of our time constraint. It took FOREVER to get our checks, and after looking at mine, they charged me for the steak meal AND the salad meal! I paid in cash to hopefully speed the process up because it was already past our hour time limit. When the waiter came back, he told me there wasn't any change left in the drawer and that he had to get the manager to go in the safe to get more change for the register. At this point, I told him to just keep the change and we were out of there. Forever."}
{"text":"Chili's is my place. It always satisfies and it's friendly to my wallet. The chips and salsa are a must but it's hard to put them down so come meal time, I get full fast! The Presidente Margarita is bomb.com. The Chili's on Sardis road doesn't get too crowded when we visit so we are seated immediately and I love it. My fiancé and I are regular here."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Ok food. We kept pressing the call button for our check for 15 minutes and our server was too busy chatting with another customer. We asked another waiter to please bring us our check and he did not help us. Our server was bald, not sure of his name. He needs to learn how to take care of his tables, if he can't handle just two that is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Chili's is a great spot to hangout & enjoy great food and drinks. This spot definitely can get packed on weekends due to ASU being nearby but their service is great. They have delicious fajitas and yummy drinks (both alcoholic & non-alcoholic). Its definitely great also, because it is family friendly. Good spot to chill!"}
{"text":"Went here last night after seeing multiple ads on the tv of the new $10 three course meal. I love sweets so what really made me want to go was the mini molten cake!   When we walked in we were greeted right away and sat at the bar. The waiter came by and quickly asked us what we wanted to drink. We just sat down and couldn't decide so asked for some waters. Not too long after that our waiter came back to ask us if we were ready to order. I asked for another quick minute as we were debating on whether it would be better to get the deal we saw on TV or the 2 for $22. Well that minute turned into 20 minutes which my husband had to flag our waiter down and tell him we were finally ready to place our order. Which was kind of odd to me since he literally sat us down and came to us twice before.   We ended up just going for the 2 for $22 since it was bigger portions according to my husband. I got the half rack of ribs , he got some chicken pasta dish, and we chose the guacamole and salsa for the appetizer.   The chips were piled high on the plate when they came and the salsa looked a bit watery. To me it kinda tasted like the tostito salsa you buy at the grocery store but the guacamole was okay.  The ribs were okay a little burnt in some areas and the pasta was cheesy. What really disappointed me was that I heard another waiter tell the new table across from us that there were options for sauces for the baby back ribs. I was surprised there were other options like honey Chipotle to pick from and I have no idea why our waiter neglected to mention those options to me when I ordered my dinner.   We ended up getting the molten cake for dessert because my husband knows I love chocolate. It wasn't as I remembered but it was still good."}
