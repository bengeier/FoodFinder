{"text":"Completely unorganized. While I was there to buy sweets.another person jumps in line and the person in store did not bother to tell him that I came first. Instead he just served him as if nothing happened.I left the place. Until they start behave and respect customers I won't and will not recommend him to ally friends."}
{"text":"Now, most of the pastries on offer consist of the same basic blocks (phyllo + honey + nuts), but my sister and I swear by their swar as being the perfect ratio of syrup to pastry in the perfect form. Biting into the ring of pastry allows for a sudden burst of syrup on the tongue as the crisp texture of phyllo and butter mingle in each bite. All unified by the taste of crunchy and buttery pistachio. Heaven with a cup of tea - orange pekoe in particular.  Pistachio and date mammouls are excellent. Chabyate & karabiges are on offer as well. The pastry for the wardeh is made on-site.  See blog for photos!"}
{"text":"quality went down since the last time I visited...Baklawa king in Mississauga is 10 times better"}
{"text":"Our second trip to this hidden gem, has not disappointed. Clean, small bakery with display cases  filled  with Middle Eastern sweets!  We came to get a variety of treats to bring to a BBQ and we left with a chocolate sample that was so flavourful and filled with  nuts! Our first trip, we also had some sweets thrown in to try and keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Best kenafa in GTA!!!! Clean place and reasonable prices. I wish they make more variety...."}
{"text":"After reading such positive reviews on Yelp, my mom (lover of middle eastern sweets) and I definitely had to give Patisserie Royale a try.   Upon walking into the shop, we were greeted by a comfortably clean and modern interior with a small sitting area with meter-high stools. The sweets counter was filled with an assortment of delicate looking baklava, petite fours, Kanafeh and other Lebanese delicacies. We opted for a walnut baklava, date ma'amoul, and some other pastries topped with chopped pistachios. Unfortunately it is with regret I know not the name of the latter. The baklava was so light and flakey and surprisingly not overly sweet! It was moist yet at the same time not soggy or drenched in syrup. The kanafeh I enjoyed more than mom did. It had sweet floral notes and was delicious warm. The date ma'amoul was filled with sweet dates and had an exterior of a crumbly and light cookie \"crust\".   I struggled with giving this place 5 stars as what was missing was some black coffee or tea to go with the pastries. They did have an assortment of juices and pop, but some hot beverages would really complete the whole experience!   Overall, the sweets truly did not disappoint! We left with a box in hand and a plan to go back to buy some more as gifts."}
{"text":"Fantastic dessert. Flavourful. Service was good and owner was friendly to my child who got a free cookie."}
{"text":"Baklava heaven!  Made with sugar water, the baklava here is crispy, sweet, and decadent. They have different types depending on the nuts that you fancy.  The selection here can't be beat for Lebanese sweets! I love visiting here and the staff are very helpful.   Pistachio everything. So yummy! :D"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Middle Eastern bakery in Toronto, and I have been to many of the top ones. The most striking thing about their desserts is that they are made up of high-quality ingredients, they are not overly sweet and have a nice flavour.  The way I found them was interesting too. We were in the Leslieville area, and felt like having coffee. So we walked into Hailed coffee shop. They had some nice looking desserts and we were feeling like desserts after a nice meal. So we tasted some, and we were floored by the flavours bursting in the mouth. While leaving we asked them where did they get their sweets from, and they mentioned about Patisserie Royale. I immediately knew that I'll be paying them a visit very soon.  Last Tuesday, I bought a box containing Bazarek, Borma, Swar and Wardeh and it was gone by Thursday. I'm gonna go there again this week. The best ever."}
{"text":"Best Kanafeh in Toronto! Rates alongside Anatolian's (near Thorncliffe Park). But in addition to Kanafeh, excellent Baklava and Mammoul.  Extremely nice and friendly folks!"}
{"text":"I came here specifically to try their kanafe and it was pretty good, but I can't compare it to anything else. The man behind the counter was very sweet. I ended up purchasing 3 pieces of all of their Baklava's with pistachios because it's one of my favourite nuts.   The Balaurieh was neither bad nor good, it was a unique flavour combination with the pistachios and rose water. It was great to try, but I don't think I would get it again. The Swar was my favourite one closely followed by Wardeh and finally their Baklava with Pistachios. I should also mention that I am not the biggest sweet tooth so I preferred the less sweet desserts."}
{"text":"This place is a winner when it comes to desserts from the region they represent. I have had a bit of exposure to desserts from this area but am not familiar with some of  the non main stream offerings (more on that later).  The place is airy and clean in a non descriptive collection of stores and is located in the back so get your directions down before venturing here. There was pouring rain when I walked in and shop was somewhat empty. I immediately eyed the Kanafeh as it was recommended by a YDB as one of the best in the city. I have not had this dessert before so wasn't sure what to expect as hadn't had a chance to read up about it either. They asked whether I wanted it warmed up for eating which is good as I wouldn't have known that was proper way to consume it.  I was expecting a rush of sugar which is synonymous with desserts from that region. I was pleasantly surprised as the cheese base mellowed out the sweet. Interesting texture and lingering taste of rose essence. An off beat dessert IMO and worth a try if you don't prefer the overly sweet desserts. I was visiting guests after so I ordered a variety of baklava (mainly pistachio based) for all to try. Hmmm some of these were decent and some overly dry or sweet and didn't hit the spot. I have had better versions of baklava which were home made. Depending on one's penchant for baklava they might do it for you.  I saw some frozen items as well (take home and bake) and nice variety of haloomi cheese. Decent selection of biscuits as well. 4 Stars IMO for the Kanafeh alone."}
{"text":"Amazing Lebanese sweets! Everything is fresh and tastes fantastic. The owners freely give samples and are genuinely lovely people. Will be coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"These baklavas are great. They are not overly sweet, unlike most places I've been.   Even though the price of each type varies per pound, they charge a buck a piece if you get  just a handful.   Store is towards the end of the parking lot (when entering from Kennedy)."}
{"text":"I think I found my go-to baklava place.  Patisserie Royale serves a wide variety of baklava as well as delicious Lebanese desserts using only select ingredients. They people working there are very proud of what they do and are confident that they make the best baklava in Toronto - it's definitely the best I've had!  You can select different types of baklava for $30/kg and ends up being around a $1/baklava as others have mentioned. Not that pricy. The baklava from Patisserie Royale have a stronger note of orange blossom and rose water - very floral. My mom loved them and devoured the box I brought home. Each type of baklava has a different texture as well. I thought that they are much more delicate than the ones that I have tried in the past.  I also enjoyed a mafroukeh because I read that there are not many places in Toronto that make them. Soft cheese, pistachios, rosewater sounded right up my alley so I decided to get a small container of it to try at the place (there are bar stools there). It is $22/kg and ended up being around $5 for a small styrofoam box. It has the same rosewater fragrance as the baklava but with the extra cheese component. It's not your typical ripened cheese so you don't even taste the cheesiness at all. A delectable dessert. I hope to try the kanafeh next time!  P.S. it's really hard to find at the end of a small strip of plaza"}
{"text":"Hands down the best baklava I've had! The guys are extremely helpful! They even let me taste things before purchasing. The knafeh is my new favourite thing!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhmazing baklava in entire GTA and I swear by this. I live in west end, but never mind the 30 km drive to buy this. Their each item is literally piece of heaven. It is Sooooo damn good that I wanna cry."}
{"text":"ok I don't know the name of it but my favourite one was made from semolina and it looked more of sandwiched square with yummy sweet stuff inside.  I would go back for that and to try this Kanafeh which was recommended in another review.    And after reading some reviews I am curious to the competition in MIssissauga!!    Their baklava was nice and crispy but I thought it lacked flavour.  I liked the sweets except the baklava."}
{"text":"Easily the best baklava in Toronto. I read an article on blogto that ranked this place the best for baklava in the city so I had to check it out. As soon as I walked into the bakery I knew I was going to be in for a treat, the smell alone was intoxicating. I am of middle-eastern decent so I know what  authentic baklava tastes like and this place is on point! They sell the stuff by the kilo, you can get one type or an assortment, I opted for 1 assorted kilo.   The baklava is made fresh and infused with orange blossom. The phylo pastry is flaky, the nuts are crunchy and the syrup is deliciously sweet, leading to an explosion of flavours and textures in your mouth. My favourite of the assortment is the \"asabeh\" but each of the different types was very well done and they virtually melt in your mouth.  This place also has other middle-eastern desserts, most notably knafeh (which sells out quick apparently so you have to get there early to get some). They also make cookies and other baked goods. This is a grab and go place, and I did not notice if they have seating or not (I was too giddy). It is located in a run down strip mall in Scarborough and is truly a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Oh the sweet aroma of this cute and lovely shop. I ordered a variety of treats to try. I could not even control my excitement and started eating as soon as I got into the car. Each piece was absolutely amazing.  Very friendly staff as well making it a 5 star experience.  Definitely returning when  in the country."}
{"text":"I was looking up a dessert location nearby on Yelp and found this place. Patisserie Royale serves Middle Eastern pastry and when I saw photos of kanafeh on Yelp, I knew I had to come here!!   When I walked in with my friend, I didn't see kanafeh in the pastry case and was somewhat disappointed but when I asked, a worker showed me that they have it hidden behind the pastry case. I was super excited to order it!! The worker asked if it was our first visit and I said \"yes!\" and he offered me and my friend a free sample of the kanafeh that he kindly warmed up for us--what a welcome!!   Biting into the kanafeh was just.. indescribable! The sweet flavour of the dessert infused with rose water and the stringiness of the cheese... I am salivating just trying to describe this!   I ordered other pastries along with the kanafeh and each are delicious! The pastries average about $1 a piece, which is extremely reasonable, especially since the quality of the pastries are quite high!!   They also have a small seating area by the window that allowed me to gobble a piece of pastry before I head home--love it!  I highly recommend this location!! I plan to be back some time to get more kanafeh!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best baklava I've had in Toronto!  Every piece is so delicately made and melts in your mouth with just the perfect amount of sweetness.  I usually get a mix of the different baklava and pay by weight. It's pricey about ($30/kg) but absolutely worth the treat.  If you're in the mood to try desserts other than Baklava , I would also recommend the Kanafeh (cheese pastry) and ask for it to be warm so the cheese becomes stringy. I also really like the mafrouka which is a rose water semolina based dessert with cream and pistachios. Not overly sweet and oh so good!"}
{"text":"No need to go into the details as to why this place gets a 5 star. Hands down BEST LEBANESE SWEETS in Toronto, Ontario, Canada... Heck even North America.   They never disappoint. The quality and taste of everything (yes, I've tried it all) is exceptional. The variety of fresh, flaky baklawa. The petit four is a melt in your mouth, buttery, orgasmic experience.   Don't bother going anywhere else. Seriously."}
{"text":"I just might have found my baklava fix in the east! But the best is still in the west. At least in my humble opinion.  It was a snowy April afternoon that I stopped by this swanky place. Nicely decorated unlike most of it's kind (sorry, if I've offended anyone). One lonely man stands behind the counter a little perplexed as to why a Chinese man is in his store. And all the while we looked at each other in confusion because I was confused at why he was confused.... he handed me a baklava. I hesitantly devoured it and asked for more...  Our exchange was brief and I was out the door in minutes with my box of goodies. I couldn't wait so I devoured a few in the car. It was.... good. Fantastic texture; light, airy and crispy! Those nutty flavours fill your taste buds and lingers a little. And with the tiniest hint of honey at the end, almost unnoticeable. I did however notice the overwhelming sweetness these little buggers provided.  This is definitely in the upper echelon of baklava's I've had over the years. I wouldn't dare say this is the best as there's a clear winner today and it's the King out West. Texture wise these guys are superior. Somehow the baklava is lighter and crispier but it's that seductive, unwavering, lingering honey aftertaste that I am after. One only the King has given me so far. The way I see it is this, Patisserie is a thrill ride when you bite into it and like a rollercoaster it ends rather quick. While the King is like the coaster that gives you the light-headiness long after the ride."}
{"text":"I have to review this place! We've been going here for the last 4 years and have been loyal since we first ordered their heavenly baklavas.  Everything is fresh, pure and so rich. You can really taste the quality in their craftsmanship and ingredients, they don't skimp out with cheap imitation butter.  Tip: if you are after real Palestinian knafeh- this is the spot but call ahead to reserve your order because they sell out almost always on the weekend.  Service is great as well! The family is humble and easy to work with (we always reserve large quantities of knafeh on the really busy days)!"}
{"text":"I found an old Globe&Mail clipping mentioning this spot and had to check it out.  I was so happy I did.  It's in a small corner strip mall so keep your eyes open when going to the spot.   I would NOT consider this spot in Scarborough... its only a few minutes off of the DVP.  The family owners are AMAZING!  I wasn't familiar with any of the pastries and the young man spent the time to explain the different varieties and helped me make a variety of pastries. He was so knowledgeable and even explained how the quality and source of the different nuts alters the taste.    I brought 2 boxes for a dinner party and they were devoured immediately.  Everyone was able to find a favourite-- did I mention that none of us are actually middle eastern... so this was a great treat.  Everything tasted fresh and sweet and the perfect balance of moistness.  The pricing is incredibly reasonable!    Cross the DVP onto Eglington and get ready for...finally.... so passionate patisseries that can impress anyone with taste buds!"}
{"text":"Really good baklava and exceptionally friendly service. When you walk in you're engulfed by the sweet aromas  of baked goods. Smells sweet and buttery. Large assortment of pastries in a cute and clean environment. The baklava melts in your mouth and is sweetened to perfection. Just to scale, I'm someone who gets \"no sugar\" or \"little sugar\" in my BBT orders, so when I say this baklava is sweetened to perfection, I mean the sweetness isn't overpowering.   I want to add that I'm a customer with several food allergies (including peanuts, eggs, and some tree nuts), and my questions were answered knowledgeably. They helped me pick out pastries I could have.   If you have an egg, peanut, and/or almond allergy, you might be safe here! None of their baklava contain egg or peanuts, and only one of them contains almonds. The rest are walnut, cashew, and pistachio.   Nothing negative about coming here. I'll be coming here regularly :-)"}
{"text":"The best baklava in Toronto, period. I usually get an assortment for dinner parties or special occasions, with a couple extra wardeh for me personally. :)"}
{"text":"Baklava here tastes better than Serranos. A little expensive but great texture and taste. The young man holding down the counter is a delight."}
{"text":"Love it.  People who work there are really nice. Love Halawat aljabn the best ever... keep it up guys"}
{"text":"I found out about Patisserie Royale's relocation, after reading an article in the TO Star.  Through this article, I also found out that they had kanafeh in pita ($5) and this semolina-based dessert, Mafroukeh.  (I've only found the kanafeh sandwich in one other place, Arz.)  Prior to this new location at Ellesmere/Kennedy, they were at Lawrence/Vic Park.  Somewhat shady area, unit was definitely out-of-date, and it was located in a rundown strip mall.  This new unit is more upscale, elegant (marble tiled), with heavy Euro-influence.  If you wanted to enjoy your pastries on-site, a few stools were available.   Kanafeh in Pita - Alright.  Maybe it wasn't warmed up enough in micro, but it was better the first time I had it.  I had a few bites and will save the rest up for breakfast, will warm up for longer in the AM, enjoying with some coffee.  Mafroukeh (by weight) - Yummm.  Really good!  I'd recommend this one as I don't see it available at other baklava places.  Customer service was quite nice.  They offered me a sample when I inquired about their mafroukeh, BUT that also enticed me to actually purchase a piece!  Various baklava - Price is by weight, it's approx. $1/pc.  To be honest, I prefer the taste at my usual place in Mississauga.  If I were in the area, I wouldn't hesitate to stop by for the pita/mafroukeh.  Would be nice if they had some caffeinated beverages as an option.  Aside from the drinks in the fridge, I never saw any other drink options."}
{"text":"OMG, sooo good!  With each bite, I felt as though I died and went to baklava heaven!  I know this doesn't say much, but out of Paramount, Baklawa King, Adonis, Arz, not to mention Costco/Rabba (ha ha!), Patisserie Royale had the best baklava - including kanafeh!  Nothing was overly sweet, dripping in syrup, and everything was fresh tasting, nicely infused with subtle flavour.  No stale stuff here!  I can't vouch for the mammouls 'cause I tend to stick strictly to the baklavas.  Got a box of approx. 11 pieces for $10, so not too bad.  Kanafeh was $5 for a nice sized square piece.  Man behind counter seemed really sweet.  Since they're all the same to me, but slightly different shapes and maybe different nuts, I just asked him for $10 worth of assorted baklava.  I think that's the way to do it for those of you who don't know what's what!  So please don't let the rundown plaza or interior fool you.  Just listen to these reviews...and your tastebuds.  P.S.  Before I was served, man was packaging up gift baskets of baklava!  What a wonderful housewarming/bday/other present, hint hint!"}
{"text":"I know ... I keep reviewing the same places over again.  Why not?  If a place is tried and true, keep going with it.  Went there today and again ---exquisite.  The mamoul filled with dates was divine.  It was almost as good as the ones I used to make when I was young and had the energy to bake.  The taste of the rose water was subtle, but in the background, the semolina dough, just perfect.  Love this place.  They also have graibe (shortbread) but I resisted the temptation.  Tried a cheese-filled basbousa which was gorgeous (sweet and delectable) ..."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I haven't written a review for this place yet. This is a little family-owned Lebanese pastry shop that is honestly a hidden gem.   The second you walk inside, you see an array of petit-four pastries that are commonly seen and a staple of Lebanese cuisine. The shop is clean and the service is great.   I've tried a few of the baklava style pastries here and they are fantastic. But this review is in honour of the most delicious piece of cheesy heaven. They sell something called Halawet el-jibn, which on their website they call sweet cheese. It's the most amazing dessert you'll ever try, especially if you love cheese. But it's not just any cheese.. there's a mix of different cheeses with semolina, then topped with pistachios and rose water. Honestly, I'm drooling as I type this and as I'm eating it!   The great thing about this dessert is that you can have it in a \"cake\" shape like I did (look at the picture I posted). Or, you could get it rolled into small pieces perfect for parties. However, you have to call ahead (about 24 hours) and ask them to roll it and they'll place it for you on a cute plate ready to be served.   I highly recommend this place and will most definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"As a self proclaimed baklawa expert I felt it imperative to impart some knowledge.     It's all about the layers...real baklawa is labour intensive, brushing a bit of butter on each thin sheet and then layering layer by layer.   This gives it the light but crunchy bite we all love.   Cheap baklawa is chewy because they will stack and layer multiple layers resulting in a chewy soggy baklawa.  So look for the flaky crisp layers people.  Class dismissed"}
{"text":"Omg sweet pure baklava ecstasy. 26$/kg.  light dainty pastries. Not overly hosed down with honey like other places. Help I can't stop eating them :("}
{"text":"Bak-LOVE-a!! I am currently smitten by this patisserie. My workplace is just steps away and I'm so glad I checked them out! They make the best baklava in TO, no question about it. They have many kinds-- pistachio, almond, cashew, walnut and they come in different pretty shapes. The filo is very flaky and not soggy on the underside even after a day or two. The filling is nutty with that hint of rose and just the right amount of syrup. Each piece is perfection! They also have a huge variety of other interesting sweets which I would like to try soon. What calories? Is there such a thing?!"}
{"text":"I last visited this establishment at their old location (Pharmacy and Lawrence). Their new one now has a smaller, more decorative interior.  No loss in quality though as their sweets are just as amazing as before. I ordered a dozen assorted; baklava (one with walnuts, the other with pistachios), assabeh (with almonds), wardeh (pistachios), and borma (pistachios) for $13 in total. They are best to be consumed the same day you get them (still good after spending the night in the fridge, but the ones I had that day were great). The filo pastry is delicate on top and crumbles as soon as you bite into it. It is not soggy from the honey. The ground nuts on the bottom are drenched in honey but in small bites it is not too sweet at all. All of their products are high quality and Patisserie Royale is my favourite place for baklava."}
{"text":"Legitimately the best Middle Eastern sweets shop you'll ever visit, anywhere. I live in California where there are an abundance of Arab bakeries and none of them can compare to Patisserie Royale - I've also been to the Middle East many times and Turkey and still, this place has everyone beat. I cry a little whenever I eat a ma'mool or baklawa because I know I won't be able to have it again until I visit Toronto :(.   My favorite things are the pistachio ma'mool and the walnut baklawa, but you could literally close your eyes and point to any of the sweets and you'll be in heaven!"}
{"text":"Yelpers don't lie!  Went on based on others recommendation and boy was the baklava good!  Got 6 assorted pieces which came to $5.  Loved most of them.  Everyone is right on when they say it's not drowning in sweetness in fact it's just right.  Plaza is a little scuzzy but hey don't judge a book by its cover!"}
{"text":"Best baklavas I've ever had! Seriously, pretty impressive quality. It really worth driving from Toronto to their shop. The pastry is crunchy, very fresh and very aromatic. Not too much syrup, as you would usually see around, what makes it even more special."}
{"text":"The bestestest baklava EVER!!! Can't stop eating! It's soft as well as crispy...very tender inside and deliciously fresh tasting. We went all the way from Oakville to get the baklavas and it was so worth it. I am hooked and I will be their loyal costumer forever!!! If you haven't been there even once then you are missing out.   Very nice staff! The staff who helped us was very friendly. When he heard we have never been there before, he asked us to sample a piece..well, initially I was getting half kg but after sampling I got a full kilo. DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Pâtisserie Royale is a hidden gem at Kennedy and Ellesmere. I just discovered this place while scrolling thru yelp and I knew I had to take a visit.  The shop is fairly small but there is such a variety of sweets that they have. Everything was decadent.  I ordered a few baklava to taste and everything tasted so fresh!!"}
