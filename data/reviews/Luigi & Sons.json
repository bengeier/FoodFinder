{"text":"Great spaghetti. When my wife and I want to have a good authentic Italian meal, we go to Luigi's."}
{"text":"Looking for an authentic Italian restaurant?  Reasonable prices?  A cool Italian-style atmosphere?  If that's not enough to entice you to eat at Luigi & Sons, then maybe their Fettuccine & Baby Clam white sauce will lure you in. I love pasta with white clam sauce, and they serve the very best that I've ever had!  They're not stingy with the clams either!  Go ahead and try their Antipasto salad while you're there.  This creation contains lettuce, tomato, a bit of pickled carrots/cauliflower, green & black olives, as well as ham, salami, capicola & provolone cheese rolled together and cut into pinwheel slices which cover the top of the salad.  This is served with their own homemade red-wine vinaigrette.   That salad not only tastes awesome, it also looks pretty cool too.  You can get it in two sizes: \"for one\" or \"for two.\"   They have a wide variety of appetizers and the Sausage Stuffed Mushrooms are pretty tasty.  Honestly, everything that I've ever had at Luigi & Sons is great; it's the VERY BEST AUTHENTIC ITALIAN restaurant that I've been to. They also have sub sandwiches, but I haven't tried them.    Not to be overlooked is the fact that, when I was there, their health grade was 98!!  :)   Suh-weet!"}
