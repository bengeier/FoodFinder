{"text":"You come in because you see they've got chorizo there, and then you're surprised by how many different types there are available. Then you go \"oh, they've got empanadas - I'll grab one to go\" and when you eat it, you'll be happy you got it.   But you probably didn't realize how much you missed here. Did you notice the great marbling and ageing on the steaks (although can be South American cuts, so not that familiar looking)? Did you consider the other non-empanada hot table items?   It's easy to pass over this place, but it's worth to give it that second look to realize there's lots of quality here at a reasonable price - just like the rest of Kensington Market."}
{"text":"Mmmm Empanadas! I had a fantastic Humita empanada for lunch today, it was great.  There is also a large selection of Chorizo here and several products from South America.  Run by very nice people."}
{"text":"They have a good selection of tasty chorizo as well as great tasting snacks upfront. Most chorizos are priced at 8$ a lb and you have a variety of selection based on the spice level that youre looking for. A must visit if you're in the Kengsington area."}
{"text":"I grabbed two empanadas the pastry was dry, tough and dense. The filling was sparse and not very tasty. I didn't go in the store and try anything else, I will have to next time."}
{"text":"great place for a quick snack. Empanadas are fine but Egg and Chicken together is just weird. The pulled pork on fried plantain is one of the best things I have eaten in this city. for $4. Go for that"}
{"text":"Delicious chorizo and sausages. Have to try more flavours but I had one with Rosemary that was delicious. Try the bacon as well, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My 2 experiences at Segovia have been great.  1) Their chorizo stew is amazing!  2) they sell empanada wrappers. The guy working there took the time to explain how to prepare them. He was so helpful and nice. I look forward to trying to make my own empanadas."}
{"text":"I almost always stop by this place when I'm in Toronto for some Colombian empanadas or feijoada brasileira.  It's relatively cheap and inexpensive South American food (looks like mostly Chilean, Peruvian, Colombian, and Brazilian).  They also have meats as well."}
{"text":"I haven't tried a lot of Latin American food and I was pleasantly surprised. Dirt cheap food and super delicious.   Anyways, like a lot of stores on Kensington, it can be easy to miss. This is a meat store in the back with a front for selling food. No tables. I'm really sick of seeing so many hot dog stands in Toronto. I think Latin American food would make an excellent street food.   We ordered 2 empanadas (mozzarella and humita), a Brazilian chicken ball, and a small empanada. It came out to be about $12 after tax and it managed to fill the 2 of us.   The empanadas are decent in size for their price. The stuffing for humita was nice. I love spinach and vegetables in general. Mozzarella was awesome (cheese is never bad). The chicken ball was shockingly filling. Not sure what was inside exactly but I think it was chicken and cheese. MmmmmMM. It filled me up in just a few bites.  I would come again."}
{"text":"Although Sanagan's get all the fame for being visible and right at the intersection of Kensington and Baldwin, Segovia is also a place for meat but you probably wouldn't know it from their street presence and first impression of their store front.  On the west side of Augusta between Baldwin and College is this store but on their sidewalk portion in front of their entrance is a street service type of extra bit... yes that's how I explained it.  It doesn't seem to have anything to do with being a butcher either.    The first thing I see are such things as empanadas, pastries, churros and things like that.  Kensington has so many places that serve these type of food items and Segovia is yet another one that does.  While I didn't get any meat (no meat purchased that day) we did pick up a few snacks and let me tell you the grilled cheese empanada is quite filling."}
{"text":"How have I not written a review for here? It's stunning for small bites. I've had a number of their empanadas and they're all amazing. Shout outs to the cheese one and the dessert one. Mmmmm. As you go deeper in, they also have a ton of different chorizo varieties, including one that is very, very green. Wanted to try it, but didn't have the cold storage to handle it then. Another day!"}
{"text":"The best place for sausages in Toronto. Such a wide variety of chorizo - spicy and not so, whatever your taste. The butcher is really nice. The chorizo are generous size and reasonably priced. Closed on Mondays, I believe."}
{"text":"excellent place, exactly what I thought it would be. It is a small dirty spoon/butcher place. I went here with my friend who came from Belo Horizonte (brazil) 3 months ago. Empanadas are what they eat there for fast food, and many things in here reminded him of home.  They have a very wide selection of  stuff you might find in a food stand in south america, we had empanadas, a chicken ball, and a brazilian dessert cookie. I liked everything we had here and my buddy said it was made just like they did back home.   Prices are cheap, most things are well under $5 and the sizes of the things are fair.  The service was very good as well, there are no seats but the guy working the counter had no problem with us standing by the front while we ate, very friendly and down to earth atmosphere.  It's a great place for some quick south American food, fills you up real cheap and here they make it like it is meant to be made.  I rate this place 4 stars, I gave them 5 stars because they have a poster of Trudeau that says in Spanish \"Trudeau: in Latino's hearts forever!\"  old schools liberals know whats up."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of chorizos paired with a short menu of down-home latin comfort foods. The colombian chorizo is a clear winner, and I always stop to get a piping hot coxinha or humita on the go. An essential part of the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Great selection of real chorizos always fresh and tasty, and of course a bunch of familiar Latino meat cuts. This is the only place where I've found uncooked \"cueritos\" (pork rinds).  The empanadas are a great meal on the go since there's no seating at the store. The owner and his mom (really) will serve you in English and Spanish always willing to help out with any recipe or question."}
{"text":"This little deli is tucked in Kensington market & rarely has a wait. I have no idea why besides the fact that most people don't realize they serve cooked food.  The sausage I had was great value at $5 and very filling. Tremendous flavour and worth getting if you like to try different types of foods different days.  I'd have it again."}
{"text":"My hubby and I were introduced to this meat shop/ food place last year and we like it. Being a vegetarian, the only thing I have tried here is the 'Corn mashed' served with tomato salsa and sauces you can add. I really enjoy this dish thorough every time I eat it. My hubby loves his empanadas as well.   Would recommend to friends/ family. I am giving it 3 stars mainly because there's no proper place to sit especially if you have a little one with you or during winter months ( too cold to stand outside and eat). Staff seem just okay, older lady there doesn't really smile much."}
{"text":"Wish we had more places like this in Hawaii! Fresh sausages that are yummy! Very reasonable prices too. Their sausage selection is wayyy better than the hipster meat place down the street (which will remain unnamed for now)."}
{"text":"Awesome place to buy chorizo.  They have numerous varieties such as Columbian, Guatemalan, Spinach etc etc...  I am spoiled from buying any other sausage, once you have tried this.  This place is a little bit pricey, but I have no problem paying a little extra for these!"}
{"text":"The empanadas are not as good as the chilean across the street, but the chorizo is amazing and fresh!"}
{"text":"Amazing empanadas and other Latin American products, I bring my son and he loves eating all the delicious products they have! Not a place to sit down though ;-( but truly delicious."}
