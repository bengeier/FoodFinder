{"text":"I had gotten out of the habit of eating sushi since moving to Arizona 4 years ago.  Everything underwhelmed, so I'd save it for trips to California or back home.  Well, I found a place that may make sushi a regular part of the rotation once again.  Sushi Nakano is a traditional Japanese-style sushi spot.  It's cozy with a 3-4 tables and sushi counter.  The fish was the most fresh I have had in Arizona.  The owner, Leo, really made the four of us feel at home.  Highly recommend for those people seeking an intimate sushi experience that's about the quality of the fish and craft of sushi."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place opened up. It's easily my favorite sushi restaurant in the Valley. I had a few days off from work and ended up going three days in a row for lunch. I asked for omakase each time and was never disappointed. From the ankimo to the striped bass to the yellowtail, everything was fresh and delicious. The service was great and the staff friendly. My only \"complaint\" is that it's in Chandler (I live in Scottsdale) so it's a farther drive for me, but that's probably a good thing otherwise I would be going every day. Five stars."}
{"text":"So good!  The quality is amazing, very similar to my experiences in Tokyo.  The service is top notch and the food is well worth it.  100% recommended.  Great wine, whiskey, and shochu collection too.  Can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Solid. Fresh and presentation sets it above other Japanese restaurants.  It is small so get here early.  Only complaint is the lighting is a little funky but it does remind me of small restaurants in Asia.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This may be the second or third review between Goog, Yelp, and the others. That is how you know it is nothing short of phenomenal. My wife and I had the Rising Sun and Vegas rolls on top of the Habaki(spelling) rolls and the Tuna Belly.....That tuna belly was so damn good that I turned my head away from my wife to hide my smile so she would not be influenced by how FANTASTIC it was until she produced her own. We then both let out the cliche, \"oh my god!\" with our mouths still full.  We are from the Washington D.C. area where there are many authentic sushi venues to choose from and this place is above those without question. The tempura for the Vegas Roll was fresh out of the fryer, still steaming. The presentation far above what you see from other popular (westernized) sushi establishments in the area."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Arizona! We drove over an hour to visit this amazing restaurant. The drive was so worth it! Quality was first class, the Chef Leo has the skill and will to do great things. Keep doing what you are doing!"}
{"text":"Not much for leaving reviews but this little place is cool. Food was awesome, staff and chefs were friendly . Seems legit."}
{"text":"TLDR; Felt uninvited and ultimately ignored. Do not come here if you want absolutely no service from the get go.  Last night I had walked in and stood by their \"please wait to be seated sign\" and went ungreeted for two minutes. Every employee has seen me stand there. Yes, including the sushi chefs. Not one \"hello\" or \"we'll be with you in just a minute\".  Finally a male server greeted me. I asked how long a wait of 7 would be. I was told the arrangement would be awkward because it is such a small space. I said that's ok. The server told me it would be about a 20 minute wait. So we went outside to wait in clear view.  About 15 minutes into waiting for our table, the guests that we were waiting on to leave for us to be able to have seats had left. They had finished cleaning the area. We waited another 15 minutes. We looked back inside. Made eye contact. Got ignored. Finally someone from our party went in to check in on our situation.  Got the run around of we weren't sure if you'd like this seating arrangement. They could've gone outside and asked us. We were already extremely annoyed by their lack of hospitality, effort, and service. We decided to leave rather than suffer through terrible service and not be able to enjoy our meal. Honestly, will not be coming back. We felt ignored and uninvited. We were extremely disappointed as we were looking to eat at a sushi place which had more authentic choices. Highly not recommended."}
{"text":"Really great Japanese restaurant. We came into try the sushi, it was fresh, very tasteful, presentation was best I have experienced in Phoenix. We tried the uni... phenomenal, maguro... great taste and tender not stringy like other sushi locations. The tamago, Futa Maki, cumber roll just the BEST!!!  Very clean, friendly, and professional restaurant.   We will be back for many more events!!  Thank you Nakano."}
{"text":"A lot smaller than I expected but glad we got there early enough to beat the crowd. The service was excellent...and might I say easy on the eyes too. LOL. The food was excellent,  fresh,  and beautifully presented. We had the kama collar for an appetizer and it was huge! The sushi was melt-in-your-mouth fresh, as was the chirashi and katsu. Very good! I will be back next year!"}
{"text":"Leo you knocked it out. The unique fish you had plus the artistic presentation was so impressive. The food was excellent and your staff was so efficient and pleasant. A must go to restaurant."}
{"text":"YESSS!!!! Finally!!! A legit sushi place in the East Valley! Outstanding, authentic sushi. The nigiri with HOUSE MADE SOY SAUCE was incredible...salmon, yellowtail and snapper. Worth the trip alone. Also try the eggplant miso (nasu miso) appetizer...so tasty. Everyone was super nice and the place is cute too. Tiny joint by Trader Joe's in Ahwatukee. Can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"Came to Sushi Nakano while on a business trip in Phoenix from LA.   Leo the head chef served us omakase style dinner with a mix between nigiri and traditional Japanese kitchen food that was just as good as the sushi in LA and Japan!   Rare find to find good fish and good chefs in the desert!"}
{"text":"I am kind of a sushi maniac and was having a big craving for it while in Chandler for work. This place did not disappoint. Had lunch here two days in a row, it was that good. Sushi in the desert is almost a contradiction, but it was very fresh and delicately prepared with an artful eye. You know the place is great when they don't drown the fish in sauces, but instead let it speak for itself. Fresh, ground wasabi root (which most places don't even carry) and a great selection of items. Order the Amaebi. Best, BEST, fried heads I've ever eaten. I devoured everything, so this was the only picture I took. Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We have been looking forward to their opening since we saw an article that they were coming! What an absolute treasure in the Tuke! This will be a destination that makes more folks drive down the I10 to Chandler Blvd! Delicious sushi and sashimi with the highest quality fish I've had in a while."}
{"text":"We couldn't have anything raw, but the rolls we had were very good.  Could actually taste the salmon in the Las Vegas for once.   I think they're still settling in with service, etc... didn't get drink refills offered.  Will be back.  Nice to have a small, more upscale option near home."}
{"text":"I am so ecstatic that I came across this restaurant. Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale is my favorite sushi place in Arizona and I was thrilled to learn that Sushi Nakano is owned by the son of Hiro himself. There are a lot of similarities with Hiro and Sushi Nakano, with the prices slightly cheaper at Nakano.  I ordered the seaweed and squid salad which were delicious. I also had the calamari which unfortunately was extremely overcooked that day. In addition, I had a spicy salmon roll, salmon skin hand roll, maguro sashimi (big eye tuna) and aji (spanish mackerel) and they were all top notch.   Sushi Nakano is a great addition to Ahwatukee. It is unfortunate that they didn't open on my side of town because I would definitely pay them a visit a couple of times a week."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today, for lunch. I have been looking for a good sushi place since moving here from the North East a few months ago.  This place is small but don't let that fool you, it's fantastic! Everything was fresh and well prepared. Miso soup, tuna sashimi, 3 different rolls, calamari & pot stickers.... all were great! Best around here, and I've been to a lot of other places."}
{"text":"Wow.    Even that is not enough to explain the ultimate bliss that met my tastebuds tonight. If you have ever been to one of Japan's highest rating sushi restaurant, you can never forget the feeling of that salmon sashimi melting its heavenly taste onto your taste receptors. The taste, the feeling, the power...... this. Was. What. I. Was. Waiting. For. I can't seem to find the right description of how amazing the flavors they bring to your table, you just need to try it and experience it.  The restaurant is small and cozy. The interaction between the dining and the sushi chef is comfortable. I don't feel awkward. The guys behind the bar are very friendly and are open to share how to experience the most out of your meal. It's not just making you sushi, it's an art for them, and they take great pride of it.  Highly recommend to any sushi lovers that are dying to have succulent tasting sashimi. They also serve real wasabi upon request. AND DO NOT MIX IT WITH YOUR SOY SAUCE!!!!! Per Chef's request :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today and was very pleased. Great menu with tons of options. So many appetizers it would be fun to come back with a few friends and just get a bunch to try. A variety of price points was nice to see. $11 lunch bento box for a quick stop off that won't break the bank, or choose from a variety of sushi at different price points when ready for a nice meal out. We did a chef's choice plate and loved it. Leo built us a delicious and beautiful arrangement, making sure to explain what everything was and how to eat each item to maximize the flavor. Excited to go back again."}
{"text":"Have mercy. This place is killing it. Came in today with a friend who quickly became a regular before my 1st time in. We ordered chef's choice. We love doing this because there is always something new to try or an tried and true delivered in a new and exciting way. Leo Nakano, chef and owner, hooked us up with the freshest most delicious surprises. No use in telling you what to order, because when you come here, you're going to get what is fresh. It's intimate and clean and welcoming. Staff so friendly and on top of it. A little delight worth mentioning is the back of the menu that offers tips on how traditional Japanese sushi was originally intended to be eaten. So interesting to read and learn all the ways we've unknowingly Americanized sushi. Will absolutely return every chance I get.  Domo arigatou, Chef Nakano!"}
{"text":"Holy crap!!!!!! So glad you guys are in Chandler. I recommend going with the \"Omakase \", you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious - but pricey.  Super pricey for our tastes.  And I get it - for good quality fish you are going to pay a pretty penny.  But unless we win the lottery this place will be a rarely visited joint."}
{"text":"The best sushi I have eaten to date. Excellent preparation and super fresh. Service was well paced. I highly recommend this place and will be back soon"}
{"text":"Haven't had a go to sushi place in Ahwatukee since Sushi Eye. Now I do! Great service and preparation!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Always a a little skeptical with trying a new sushi restaurant but this one does not disappoint, this is the real deal Japanese sushi restaurant . Fish was amazing and super fresh and the chefs are awesome!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner with the wife and sat at sushi bar. Despite the crowd, we were seated quickly.   Simply put, this is the best sushi spot on this side of town. Possibly anywhere in town. Used to love Sushi J / J's Kaiso, but since Jay disappeared, I haven't really had a go-to spot. This is going to be it.   We did omakase and just asked that it was mostly nigiri. I can't say that there was one piece I didn't like. They have fresh wasabi root here which makes everything so much better. We asked for a toro hand roll and it was absolutely outstanding. To finish the meal off, they served us a quail egg unagi piece that was so rich and buttery.   We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I stopped to try Nakano for lunch - The fish is wonderfully fresh.  Portions are small and prices very high!  It was clean and service was good.  For their lunch menu: I suggest that they increase portion sizes a little and drop the pricing down by 15-20% and then they would have a hit!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi . Tuna melted in my mouth . Owner was warm and friendly . Thrilled to have a great sushi restaurant nearby . No happy hour but would return because the sushi was so fresh ."}
{"text":"The food is a 5... excellent sushi, all very fresh.  Toro melted in mouth, flying fish, salmon, golden eye... all very good.  Skip the rolls and go for the fish.  I gave a 4 instead of a 5 for two reasons.  The space is small and tight.  I think the restaurant could do a lot better with the decor.  The walls are bare with just a few wooden blinds curiously covering wall area, not windows.  Furniture is cheap, not at all warm, and uncomfortable.  If a meal is going to cost 80 or 90 bucks, you must do better here.  The service was good at first but when a couple of parties came in at the same time, the 2 wait staff could not handle the rush (just 2 parties).  We had to ask for the check 3 times.  We will definitely go again because of the fish, but I hope the owner reads this message, makes a few tweaks and goes to the 5 he can be!!"}
{"text":"Great sashimi, and sushi. The bento lunch specials are excellent! Great selection, pick 2 items and priced right. Been to his fathers Japanese Restaurant - Hiro Sushi, both are fantastic!!"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi restaurant I've been to in a long time! An incredible, modest little environment with delicious food and friendly service, the owner is always working and interacting with guest showing just how passionate he is about what he does. Tends to be pretty busy but the wait is never long and definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Prawn head fried slightly which is very good.  The rest of Nigiri taste normal comparing to Asia,  but I guess they are good in this area"}
{"text":"If you're from the burb of 'Tukes, lets just say you're used to driving to get to places. So you can imagine all the buzz when a new restaurant opens in town. High hopes and high expectations. Luckily, Sushi Nakano lived up to those.   Hidden in an unseemingly local strip mall, Sushi Nakano is a diamond in the rough. Although it's interior is minimalist and small, it still emanates a nice kind of cozy, intimate atmosphere. The staff is friendly and attentive, and the chefs are engaging.   They offer a solid selection of nigiri. We had the salmon, hamachi, unagi and uni. All were quite flavorful, excellent amount of rice to fish and presented elegantly. We both agreed the uni was ok - definitely not the best we've had- and the hamachi really took the spotlight that night. So much so that we had to get a second order. Although I am not so much a roll person, the two orders we ordered were unique and delicious - a nice mix of different textures like crunchy rice to deep smokey flavors. The presentation was just as wonderful as the food. Each dish seemed carefully and beautifully constructed.   What I love most about Sushi Nakano is that it is unpretentious, good sushi, and incorporates creativity in its rolls without loading up on the cream cheese and unagi sauces. It's fairly priced, too...it was about $30-40 per person and I think even then we ordered too much (I left feeling very full). I will definitely be returning back quite often, and I hope it will bring people actually coming to our little, growing neighborhood."}
{"text":"Amazing! Service spot on! Sushi chefs, true artists. The sashimi is so fresh it melted in our mouth! I love the cozy setting and the friendly welcoming and saying good by!"}
{"text":"Great sushi. New place, open for a month. Knowledgeable chiefs. Veggie roll very tasty. Unagi perfect. Sakura roll wonderful. Good menu selection and better things to come I'm sure. Best of luck!"}
{"text":"We went to this place today to try their sushi. It just opened up and has great reviews on their sushi. We love sushi and been to many Japanese restaurant in town. This location was perfect for me since I live nearby. The space is very modern and bit small. The price of the sushi is bit higher than other places. We ordered salmon, clam, scallop, uni, yellow- tale, tamago(egg), shrimp tempura, few more. The shrimp tempura came out first and it was very tasty. The sushi chef showed us the unopened(shelled) uni which gave us high expectation of fresh uni. We are the big fan of fresh uni. We started with the other sushi and the uni came out after. The scallop, tamago, yellow-tale and other sushi were very fresh and tasty. It melted as it goes into my mouth. It was bit smaller size than the other sushi place but the quality was good. It looked like they know about their sushi and felt like the sushi were made as authentic Japanese style. At last, the four pieces of uni came out. I was bit disappointed by its color, the fresh uni has great color to it but it did not have that. I know that there are different types of uni, so I had to try before I judge its uni. Unfortunately, the uni tasted very \"fishy\" which should not happen if it was fresh uni. Even though they just opened up the shell, it was not fresh. The fresh uni supposed to taste fresh and rich and creamy with bit of good slimy-ness. Bit disappointed since the uni is my wife's favorite sushi. I might go back again since it was good experience overall but I know I will not try uni."}
{"text":"This intimate sushi restaurant is a hidden gem in Ahwatukee. The sashimi was delectable and presentation was top notch. I will be coming back here many times for sure!"}
{"text":"One of best sushi experience I've ever had. The quality is amazing. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place is very authentic. A little crammed but it's not trying to be RA. It's the real deal when it comes to quality sushi. Tried Toro for the first time here, will never forget the amazing quality"}
{"text":"Amazing my new favorite sushi place. The bento box was very generous and tasty best tempura and teriyaki chicken I've had!!! Las Vegas roll yummy!:-)"}
{"text":"We got there right as they we closing for lunch, but they still welcomed us in and provided us with amazing service. My husband is vegetarian and had plenty of options. The food was delicious. I will return and highly recommend it to anybody looking for authentic sushi."}
{"text":"Top 3 best and most quality sushi places in Phoenix. Fresh fish, trained chefs. A bit small inside but so worth it."}
{"text":"This review is based off of their service alone, which is a huge disappointment. 8:00 PM, we walked in and asked for a table of 7. Understanding this is a small restaurant, we expected a wait and a was informed of a 20mins wait.  We were the only party waiting in line. 8:15PM, 2 parties left and there were enough seats to take us in. 8:30PM, we were not informed about the availability so I went in and ask for an update. When I first walked in, the chef told his staff that they are closing at 9PM. So one of the servers came over and told me that he could have had us seated earlier but wasn't sure it we were okay of being seperated into 2 groups?  I would have not been upset if the server was being honest about not wanting to seat people after 8 ish. If they are going to Make excuses it should have been a better  one. At this point we decided to not dine in with them and left."}
{"text":"This is one of my first \"fancy\" sushi experiences. I'm no sushi connoisseur, usually the fanciest I get is getting the sashimi plate and only eating mostly the salmon. I was nice getting the Omakase or the chef's choice and letting someone else decide, so im forced to try new things. The fish was very fresh and there was a good spectrum of flavor in sushi terms. The only concern was some of the nigri was too heavy handed on the wasabi. This is definitely an experience for a special occasion, the price at the end of the night was pretty hefty since you don't really know what you're gonna get until you get the check; abeit it was cheaper than ordering everything a la carte."}
{"text":"I do have certain places I go to for sushi BUT this place didn't disappoint in my opinion.. if u are looking more then sushi this place isn't for you.. they have few items like bento boxes, soba noodles, typical appetizers but other than that it's pretty sushi which I like.. i took my boyfriend forever to try something that's raw but after our Seattle trip he does enjoy salmon and spicy salmon roll.. this place is small and the few table they do have fills up pretty quickly..the only thing I didn't like is the that the calamari came in with this sauce.. my boyfriend didn't really care to much about the sauce, we kinda wished the sauce came on the side and not drenched the calamari"}
{"text":"This place looks like another pop up, strip mall, business, but inside is some of the best sushi I've ever had"}
{"text":"I can't say if the premium sushi rolls were good, because they were too pricey (about 25% higher than other comparable sushi restaurants).  I had a very basic sushi roll, Negihami, which tasted good, but nothing special.  If they want to create more business, they will need to lower their prices."}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi! So fresh and tasty. Owner Leo Nakano has done an amazing job bringing traditional sushi to Phoenix. His restaurant has a great atmosphere that is very welcoming to customers. I look forward to many repeat visits to Sushi Nakano."}
{"text":"I highly highly highly recommend this restaurant! It is worth the wait. The fish is fresh plus Leo and all the other sushi chefs are fun to talk to if you're sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"This place is very different from all other competing sushi restaurants. It was very intimate and not rushed at all. I almost believe it made the sushi taste even better! The establishment is very clean and very very very small about 4 small tables and 20 sushi bar seats. The owner is very talented and his presentation is executed beautifully. The sushi tasted very fresh and delicious. I didn't get to try any of the rolls but they sounded amazing.   I hope this place is around for a really long time."}
{"text":"I love a good local sushi spot and Sushi Nakano did not disappoint! From the second we walked in the door we were treated like regular. Our server was so sweet and helpful and the other staff very friendly!   We had the shrimp tempura to start, and while it was fried, it was light and tasty! For rolls we had the Hanabi, it was super fresh and wonderful flavor, little spice balanced out by avocado. Last but not least, the most beautiful roll I have ever seen, the spicy ribbon roll, pictured here. It was almost too pretty to eat!  We finished with Mochi ice cream, green tea and vanilla for the perfect dinner!   If you are looking for a local sushi spot, with amazing food, and super friendly staff and atmosphere look no further!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting, everything was outstanding! Sushi was fresh, service was great! We even arrived 20 minutes prior to closing and we're welcomed with open arms! My husband asked for a custom sushi roll, they were more than happy to accommodate! We will be back for sure! May have found our new sushi spot in Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"Our first time in and it didn't disappoint!! The sushi is amazing and plated beautifully!! The fish is incredibly fresh. It's family owned. So so so good!! We will definitely be going back many more times."}
{"text":"Me and my roommate are thrilled that we finally have an amazing sushi place in the area. Everything was so fresh! The tuna melted in my mouth, and thanks to their recommendation, Spanish mackerel is a new favorite! Service was friendly, and Leo was engaging in between sushi chef duties. Definitely trust him with chef's choice! It all takes me back to my visit to Japan. Will definitely be visiting again!!"}
{"text":"The service was OK the food wasn't bad but very expensive the restaurants dirty it's only been open for a couple of months the floor in the women's bathroom not good"}
{"text":"We were here early with friends and family. Great presentation and great taste. Our experience was fun and enjoyable. Highly recommend people to try."}
{"text":"Best sushi anywhere. Have to get there early to get one of a handful of tables. Love the Geisha Roll!"}
{"text":"Ahwatukee got a new sushi place!  It's tiny and I have a feeling it's more of an omakase type place but they did have a nice lunch menu.   I had the spicy tuna bowl (donburri?) and it was good. I can't remember what Dan or Sarah H had, probably a lot of salmon. I can't say it was outstanding, but it was definitely good and I'll eat here again."}
{"text":"We came to check out the new place. It is super tiny but it is really good. Best miso I've tried in Phx. Not very quick service but the personnel is nice and food is gooooood!!!!  I got a reply from the owner! That's why I am upgrading to 5 stars! The service was NOT subpar just a little slow but still he took the time to reply. GREAT PLACE FOR GREAT SUSHI AND GREAT PEOPLE!!!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting my family in town and saw this cute Japanese restaurant opened up and decided to give it a try with my sister. We sat at the sushi bar and both my sister and I were feeling adventurous so we decided to ask for the chef's pick to have our chef picks whatever for us. We're definitely surprised and pleased with our decision! All the dishes were like an art display! Not only the dishes were pleasing to the eyes but they pleasing to my taste buds too!!! The quality of the sashimi here are very good!  The servers here are super nice and attentive too! They're very friendly and made sure we're always taken care of. My sister and I had a great time and we enjoyed our meal a lot!!! Overall we had a fantastic experience so I definitely would recommend it to my friends AND will make sure I come back next time when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"When you first walk into this place, you're warmly greeted by everyone.  It's a very cozy set up, perfect for groups of 2-4 people with modern decor.  We ordered gyoza, edemame, miso soup, spicy tuna roll, sakura roll and geisha roll.  Omg....the sushi was amazing!  Like melt in your mouth amazing.    We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great sushi in Ahwatukee!  Monk fish liver, uni and all of the dishes we love. Leo is an artist and the Omakase was amazing!  Our new favorite place!"}
