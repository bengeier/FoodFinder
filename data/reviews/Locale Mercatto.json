{"text":"I went here on Monday night for dinner. Here's the good and the bad:

Good: The menu is diversified with pasta, pizza, chicken, red meat, fish entrees. I ordered the margarita pizza and it was awesome! The setting is modern. They also have tables outside. The servers are very attentive.

Bad: The lamb skewers(appetizer) I ordered came completely undercooked. I tried a few of the better cooked pieces. The meat was hard. They mixed in a ton of fatty pieces. Booo! Also, a lot of their meals contain pork products although it is not impossible to find menu items without them. The staff caters to special requests if you want to leave things out of your meal.

I think the key is to order what you know here. So it is a conditional 4 star. :)"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a girlfriend on a rainy night and was seated right away. Undercooked pasta (not Al dente), just undercooked. Sauce and meatball was very well flavored so maybe ask over the pasta to be cooked longer. Salad with pumpkin seeds and avocado oil was refreshing. Seafood crostone was not well seasoned and not worth the price. Clod steak was cooked correctly but came out cold. Not someplace I would recommend."}
{"text":"The other day I had a catch up dinner with one of the bffs that I haven't seen for a while. At first we wanted to go to The Gaberdine for some comfort food, but it was so packed we ended up coming here to Mercatto. Not too bad a fall back plan, I ended up finding a new favourite dessert here! (don't worry, I'll get to this later =] )

The menu is printed right on the place mat, and consists of 4 main cateogries: 
Appetizers, Pizzas, Pastas, and Entrees. 


Table Bread

The meal started off with some complimentary bread. Warm and toasty, with a pat of butter; just perfect!


\"Fritto Misto\" ($12) -shrimp, calamari, crispy chickpeas, smoked ketchup

Jess is a big fan of calimari, she orders it every time we go out! I didn't mind it though, and I enjoyed the lightly battered array of seafood that the Fritto Mistro came with. The smoky ketchup was a nice addition, but surprisingly enough my favourite part of this was the fried chickpeas. So crunchy and good!


\"Arugula\" ($8)-apples, walnuts, lemon vinigrette, pecorino

We thought we'd keep our digestive systems in order by ordering a plate of greens to go along with our carbohydrate heavy Italian meal. I suggested the Argula salad because I love apples in salads. Not overly drenched in salad dressing, and a sprinkle of cheese.


\"Spagehtti\" ($16) -pork meatballs, tomato, smoked provolone

Whenever I visit an Italian restaurant, I try to order something I can't make at home. But I guess sometimes it pays off to stick to the classics. The pork meatballs in this Spaghetti was delicious. It tasted freshly made with lean meat, and none of that other preserved junk. While I really liked the meatballs, I found the spaghetti to be lacking sauce. As a result, it was dry and bland.


\"Diavola Pizze\" ($15) -spicy sopressata, tomato, mozzerella, basil

This was a  nice thin crust pizza, but was not very memorable for me. I did like the spicy sopressata that gave a kick to the otherwise plain pizza, but nothing too special. It also very quickly became unappetizingly tough and chewy after it cooled. Make sure you eat this promptly!


\"Tiramisu\" ($7) -italian cookies, espresso, mascarpone

We were quite full, but decided it wouldn't be a meal without dessert!  I had envisioned the Tiramisu to be in cake form, so was surprised when it came in this small little glass jar. It is filled with balls of cake soaked in coffee and  mascarpone cheese. I really liked the cheese filling which was thick, creamy, and smooth. The cake balls, not so much. I found there was too much coffee, and so the cake was a little soggier than I would've liked. Still quite good though.


\"Torta\" ($6) -lemon cake, blueberries, whipped

This second dessert we ordered I liked much better than the Tiramisu. It really surprised me how much I liked it because I generally don't like anything with lemon (It just makes me feel like I'm eating dish detergent!) But this, was just heavenly. A moist buttery cake that is not as heavy as pound cake, but light enough to melt in your mouth along side the generous heaping of whipped cream. The light hint of lemon went well with the sugared blueberries. My new favourite lemon dessert!


Overall, this was a nice place to grab some casual classic Italian fare. You're not going to get anything too fancy here, but nothing sub-par either. Expect the ordinary. I think the only thing I would come back for, is that lemon Torta!"}
{"text":"So here is my second review of Mercatto. I was disappointed the first time and sad to say, was disappointed yet again. 

After promises from friends that it has changed, it is exactly the same.

I brought a visiting physician friend from Calgary. We just missed the lunch rush which was great as we had a lot of catching up to do. I ordered one of 5 salads posted and was told by our server that it was no longer available. After asking for my second choice, that too was sold out. When asked what was available I was advised that they could make me a mismash of items that are left. What did I get? Honestly, literally a can of opened chickpeas, a few pieces of brocolli and some kidney beans. No dressing was offered, no flavouring, etc. 

My friends pizza was just okay. Lacked any flavour. It was just a tomato pizza with no depth. 

Mercatto, you have dupped me for the last time. Honestly, venutre 1 or 2 blocks in either direction and you can find far more better fare."}
{"text":"Generally good substitute for the Toronto Street location and way better than some other popular Italian establishments downtown (read:  T_R_O_I).  

The service was definitely not arrogant as at T_R_O_I, but also not as good as the Toronto location.  The waiter we had was a little too laid back, failing to check up on us and notice us when we wanted something.  He also failed to tell us about the specials on the chalkboard which wasn't too bad for us since we were seated close by, but would be annoying for those seated farther back.  

The food and particularly the pasta was excellent.  I ordered the fettucine with 1/2 lobster, not expecting it to be REALLY served with 1/2 a lobster.  That, in itself got my attention.  Pasta was well done, al dente and flavourful.  And 1/2 a lobster!  Wow, can't stop thinking about that 1/2 a lobster!

The dessert was also yummy.  I had the caramel-something-or-other which was a creamy caramel pudding in a cup.  Very smooth and velvety.  Yum.  My friends had the lava chocolate cake in a ramekin.  Looked wonderful.  

Great place for the price.  I would definitely go back, although my first choice would still be the Toronto St. location where I've had many great experiences."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch! Excellent food and service. A real gem in the financial district! I sat at the bar and the service was great. Nice people. The octopus appetizer was great! Highly recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Ah...can you say...bland. Either they've changed the cooking crew or they're taking the anti-salt thing a bit too seriously. Call me crazy but I thought it should be an automatic reflex to salt the pasta water before you cook it, especially if you're going with the no sauce option. Well, they didn't and it resulted in a meal of waterlogged cardboard. The saving grace...a great cup of cappuccino. Maybe it was an off day. I prefer their take out deal better. +ives: great cappuccinos, take-out -ives: crowded, lower hypertension inducing meals."}
{"text":"Great service but I have to agree with other users that the food was subpar. Both entrees came very salty but the pasta was very bland. The calamari app was great though so perhaps it's just the pasta chef who dumped excessive amount of salt. Service was good but food came on slow. Most people are here on lunch so faster food service would definitely help."}
{"text":"Way too noisy at dinner time. My recorder showed an average of over 90 dBa, too loud for a safe work place (a Ministry of Labour issue) and TOTALLY unacceptable if you cared to talk to your fellow diners. The food was nice and average. The service was friendly and competent. 

Will we go back? Never. I care about talking over food, not to shout and do lip reading! 

A few thousand dollars would pay for a sound absorbing ceiling - but who cares?

I do and I will vote with my feet, seeking a quieter restaurant next time."}
{"text":"I tend to visit Mercatto for business lunches as it is located right across the street from my office. While service can be a bit uneven (I've been rushed and I've been ignored), generally I find the restaurant is good. 

My favorite items on the menu are the gnocchi, the pizzas and the cheese and charcuterie platters. This location also has an incredibly pressurized wine bar; this means that they can offer dozens of wine by the glass as they are all kept fresh within the pressurized enclosure behind the bar. 

Great for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here for lunch today and although it was very busy, we were able to get a table right away. Service throughout the entire meal was great and the food came out in a timely manner. Both the meals were cooked perfectly and although the one meal was different than anticipated, both were delicious. By the end we were quite full, however decided to finish the meal off with dessert. We chose the chocolate cheesecake, and I would definitely recommend this dessert to any dessert lovers. No complaints from either of us and we will certainly return to this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"We had the grilled calamari and the carbonara. They taste pretty good but the portion is a bit on the smaller side of things. The place itself is good with candle lights for added ambiance, service was good too with attentive servers constantly ensuring that your glass is always filled with water."}
{"text":"Had lunch here a few weeks ago.  Reservations were made at 11:45 a.m. to avoid the lunch time crowd, which was perfect.  Service was good, even though it was busy.

I had the margherita pizza, which was a very good size - I would say larger than a usual personal pizza.  The crust was thin and crunchy.  Good ratio of cheese to tomato sauce and a good sprinking of fresh basil.  It was nice and light.  

Price to be expected for downtown Toronto, but nothing outrageous for lunch.  I would go back and order something different, as I saw lots of plates being delivered to other tables with wonderful looking pastas.

It s a bustling place at lunch, filled with the business crowd.  Overall a good experience and I would recommend this spot."}
{"text":"My partner and I visited Mercatto on a Thursday night at 8pm for dinner. It was completely dead, only a few other tables were occupied, which is always a worrying sign. I knew that the reviews said it was great for lunch though, so we decided to eat anyways. 

The food was great, I had the pappardelle duck ragu, it was a nice red sauce with a lot of meat, good size, not a massive serving but definitely filling, my boyfriend enjoyed the margherita pizza, saying that the cheese was very good. 

We also each had a cocktail, nothing fancy but nice, and dessert, they are quite big and rich for dessert, so we should have shared, I had the budino and he had the tiramisu and a dessert wine, everything tasted very good. It was just over $90 all together without tip.

Service was also great, but they were definitely not busy so that was to be expected.

Definitely heading there again!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely casual dinner at mercatto last night. It was exactly as it describes on its website. The service was excellent and the atmosphere lovely. I had the shrimp linguine which was delicious and just the right portion size. My husband had the pepperoni pizza which was very tasty. 
They also accommodated a stroller without question."}
{"text":"it was an excellent time. Our order was lost on the first go but how the manager handled it was fantastic. Our server also apologized and ensured that the rest of our night was excellent. The food was great and despite the little mistake, it was a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"I was heading to Terroni, but having spotted this place and having eaten at the one on Toronto Street for lunch a few days ago, i thought \"why not\"?  It was about 9.15pm on a Friday night and the place was more than half full.  I was \"greeted\" almost begrudgingly.  The waitress seated me, commenting that they would serve me as long as I didn't take hours.  

I was not offered any specials, nor could they decide who would serve me as I was asked by 3 separate wait staff what I wanted, twice after one had just taken my order.  

I really wanted a glass of white wine but they have a very limited selection with many more reds by the glass so I had an excellent glass of Sicilian Shiraz.  

First course I had griddled squid with a smoked paprika chic pea (garbanzo bean) stew, with a shaved salad and coriander.  With those flavours I expected fireworks, but the squid was overcooked (or had been over chilled), the stew dull and lacking in flavour and the salad a cold nondescript nonentity.  Dull, dull, dull.  The addition of \"fresh black pepper\" made it no better and without salt on the table to season it, it was woefully under seasoned

The bread was the worst.  This is an Italian restaurant, yet it serves limp, damp, cold bread.  GET A NEW BAKER or bake it yourself, or griddle the bread, or do SOMETHING, it is awful.  I even commented on this politely to one of the waiters who shrugged and said \"yes, it's awful, isn't it?\".  

I rarely have pizza but tonight I did. It arrived when I was eating my starter.  Great, what am I supposed to do, cram both in my mouth at once?  Was this a hint that the staff that were gyrating behind the bar to the mind-numbing music wanted rid of me?  

The pizza was flabby.  The crust just a little too thick.  The spicy sausage had been all placed in lumps, so it was dull in places and unseasoned and then you got a mouthful of salt and chilli from too much of the sausage.  Not good, not good at all.  The toppings on a pizza are not art, they are flavouring.  

So, all in all, I wish I had not bothered."}
{"text":"Located conveniently at Bay/Adelaide, this little Italian restaurant is a great spot for lunch in the financial district.

The menu changes regularly and they often have specials. They also have a take away window where things such as veal on a bun can be ordered (not on the menu), but can be ordered if you're in the know. (You're welcome!).

This time around I had the butternut squash soup - which was really fantastic. So delicious!  I also had the gnocci which was served with a tomato and ground lamb sauce with fresh parm. Also very tasty but the portion was too substantial for me to handle at lunch. Ate about half!

The downside is that it's incredibly loud in their over the lunch hour. It's convenient for a business lunch and the food is quite good, but I found myself having to yell over the hum and to speak to the server in largely (obnoxious) hand gestures.

Make a reservation if you're coming for lunch with more than 2 people, or planning to arrive after 12:00. It's rammed."}
{"text":"Style pseudo-italien chic pour travailleurs du secteur financier de Toronto : agréable, menu varié, très bon service mais bruyant et pas forcément le plus confortable. C'est pratique essentiellement."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place situated in the heart of the Toronto financial district. It is packed with bankers and tourists alike which makes it an interesting place to be in. Make reservations as there is a risk of not finding a spot during lunch.
I went with my buddy during our lunch break and were thoroughly impressed. Great service, very attentive and knowledgeable. I had the Agnello pizza which was incredible - nicely done, decent portion to get full but not sick full (perfect for lunch). My friend had the pasta (forgot which one) but loved it. And he is a relatively picky eater.
Prices are actually not bad for the location, but still on the larger side. The place is still a bit on the crowded side (small tables which makes it difficult to maneuver) but it is a great recommendation and will gladly return."}
{"text":"I've been here countless times for work-related cocktail and dinner events. It's an excellent space for booking large groups in an environment that's professional but not too casual to talk shop with colleagues. It's totally packed during the lunch hour because it caters to the Bay St. crowd. Expect suits and to overhear all sorts of networking and professional banter.

The menu has changed recently. The portions have become larger and frankly, the quality of the pasta has gone down to pub-fare. I really miss their mushroom truffle oil pasta and handmade pasta. They always have great wine pairings and the desserts are worth saving space for. The Toronto Street location is also good.

Must save room for the delicious salted caramel copetto dessert!"}
{"text":"Food was just OK to me. I ordered the Arctic char and while it tasted alright and the presentation was nice, it also seem to have been drowned in oil and butter. Portions were quite small, and the environment was sort of meh as well. We were seated near the door and I could definitely feel the freezing draft every time someone entered or left. The waitress came to check up on us once during the meal but didn't offer any other service (recommendations, refills, etc.). Probably would not come here again - not worth the price tag."}
{"text":"I've only ever come to the Bay Street location of this restaurant. I enjoy it for what it is, though I suspect that I might like the other locations a bit more. The food is tasty and decently priced. I went there for lunch one day while my boyfriend had a meeting. I stretched my lunch out for an hour or two with wine, a salad, a main and then dessert with a cappuccino. The wait staff was somewhat friendly but could probably tell that I was a single diner so it seemed they left me alone more than they might have generally. This was ok most of the time though there were a few times that I wanted to get water refilled and no one seemed to be paying any attention to me. 

Pizza is great, nice thin crust, the gnocchi is good as well. Excellent cappuccinos and the wine selection is decent. It has a nice ambiance and I would say that for someone who is going to be downtown at lunch, this is a good place to go. I love the big windows looking out to the street and the chandeliers. Oh, and the gelato is really really good!"}
{"text":"Wanted to buy dinner to my buddy on July 5. His birthday was on July 3. As his wife was at a function nearby, we were with the baby in her stroller. Him, his brother and myself, strolled into Mercatto on Bay south of Queen and were warmly welcomed by the staff. I think they thought another sequel to \"Three Men and a Baby\" was being shot nearby. But no, we were just hungry.
 A high chair was provided and we had a pleasant meal in this quiet  and relaxing joint.

We shared appetizers.An extremely fresh and tasty burrata($12, worth every bite) and a grilled calamari($12). I love calamari and this grilled specimen was so good. Firm yet tender, tasty not fishy and well seasoned.  Of course, those who know me are aware I am a recent convert to the joys of the Tentacle , and now they know I am a zealot. Which is why I had to order as my main the spaghetti chitarra with octopus(19.00). I was blown away by the taste of this dish: a combination of  octopus, tomato pesto, olives and anchovy. Toss in al dente square spaghetti alla chitarra and you simply get greatness on a plate. 
One of my dining companions had the costatine($25), a truly great beef short rib dish served with baby potatoes, green pea pesto and carrots: Beef and potatoes, italian style! It was apparently delicious. The other had his ear pulled in when he heard about the Orechiette($17) and was truly happy with this delicious ear-shaped pasta concoction: braised lamb neck, rapini, chili, mint, pecorino. A good combo.

Wines were had by the glass.An excellent Pinot Grigio($11), an Amarone ($17) and a Pirro Varone ($16). Mercatto has extensive all-italian wine list and the by the glass selection varies and changes from one Mercatto location to the other.They also have a great liqueur selection and a great range of Amari (bitters) such as the Punch Abruzzo and the Ciao Ciao Amaro (both $8). A decent double espresso($3.50) and desserts of caramel coppetta( a combination of vanilla gelato, salted peanuts, and caramel) and torta di formaggio(cheesecake) (each $7) topped off this meal nicely. 
Colin was our server.He was attentive, pleasant and patient with my friend's 1-year old daughter.

Mercatto may be a mini-chain, but the quality of its service, the choice available and the freshness of ingredients used has nothing to envy to some higher-end Italian restaurants and the prices are moderate. Overall, a great choice for lunch or dinner when in the core. Try them, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight with a group of 6.

Pros:
- easy resos and accommodating for last minute +1
- good atmosphere, good music and romantic lighting
- service was good - no attitude/issues when asked to split bills. 

Cons:
- Nothing special about the cocktails - i wasn't a big fan. Mojito was a little weird (no mint leaves and not too much flavor.. and Ceaser was totally average.
- Entrees were okay. I had the saffron risotto. It was a \"seafood\" risotto but my clams/mussels were all dried up and were paper thin mush.
- Tried the chocolate \"cake\" - was more like a chocolate brownie.. super dense and super sweet.

Perhaps I made poor decisions when picking off the menu but overall not impressed and probably won't return. Food was good but would probably spend the money at another resto downtown."}
{"text":"Being a visitor to Toronto, I asked people where I should eat.  When I arrived at those locations, I asked the servers what to eat.  Why should I, coming from Seattle, assume that I know what food is best?

This is one restaurant that was not recommended (I think people forgot about it because there was a scaffolding covering the entire place).  Rather, as I walked by several times, wonderful aromas tickled my nose and made my stomach growl.  After three days of walking by, I finally went in.

I was seated (alone) and was served several samples of beer.  The server was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to recommend several menu items.  I settled on a pizza (which is rare) and trusted my server's judgment as to which brew would best accompany my selection.

The pizza was simply delightful.  Thin crust, easy on the sauce, light on the cheese, and topped with sausage and basil.  The beer complemented the pizza perfectly.

I loved my experience at Mercatto!"}
{"text":"Really nice, casual bistro feel.  Quick and easy spot for a light lunch.  Food could be improved.

The shrimp and avocado appetizer could be improved upon - the shrimp was very fresh but it lacked flavor.

The grilled octopus was delicious - nicely charred and savory with the chickpeas and tomato sauce.

The pizza with mushrooms also could be improved upon - the crusty was undercooked and had none of that nice, smoky flavor it should have.
The mushroom pasta looked really good - lots of mixed mushrooms and very moist."}
{"text":"WHERE IS THE DARN ENTRANCE?! 

Came here with a group to celebrate a friend's birthday and was seated upstairs which was nice and lonely. Nothing really appealed to me because they seemed like common Italian dishes with inflated prices. I ended up ordering the orecchiette pugliese (with fennel sausage, rapini and peperoncini; $16.95). The portion was small, pasta a bit too oily and the rapini bitterness was overwhelming. Wasn't too impressed. Friend got a tiramisu and I had a bite, way too much mascarpone...where were the lady fingers! Pick me up? Put me down! 

A the start of the meal, they give you these packaged bread sticks in vases which taste like nothing, with a balsamic vinegar + olive oil dip but it is quite impossible to get any of the vinegar which is trapped below the olive oil. The menu also has fine print saying there is complimentary bread upon request which I thought was the oddest thing and since I love bread, I asked for it! Anddd sadly, it wasn't that great. 

At the end of the dinner, none of us found our meals very good...we all went to buy food afterwards, yikes. There was also a 18% gratuity which was extremely steep, especially since we got very little service. 

One positive point is that the decor is quite nice inside."}
{"text":"We were able to get reservations for 8 people for 6pm on a Friday night, something that we had trouble doing at other venues downtown (including other Mercattos). 

The service was good, and I really appreciated them splitting our bill for us, since we were all paying on cards, and since we ordered very differently, and thus splitting wouldn't have been fair. (Says the girl who probably ordered the most of anyone at the table.)

I shared the charcuterie plate. I do love me my cured meats, but this one didn't wow. I wouldn't recommend it. I then ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and the budino for dessert. The food was fine, but nothing blew me away, although the budino was my favourite of the night. Salted caramel people. The answer is always salted caramel.

Also, the restaurant was quite cold, and many of us had to throw on extra layers to keep warm. No one likes to be shivering through dinner, especially if they are still shivering after a plate of pasta and a glass of red wine (typical warmer upers). 

1/2 app, 1 pasta, 1 glass of wine, 1 dessert = $45 with tax and tip
Note: 18% gratuity added automatically for groups"}
{"text":"Too fancy of a menu with duck, goat cheese etc. The lasagna was the only normal thing and tasted excellent. The second time I ordered a thick pasta in tomato sauce which didn't taste very good. Not a place I would go back to for the food at all. Much better Italian places at a stone throwing distance. The service was excellent so they have that going for them."}
{"text":"This place was packed with the lunch crowd and I guess is geared towards this crowd i.e. quick service and turnover. We were not their ideal client as we intended to spend some time here in celebration mode :) 
We started out with appetizers of fritto misto and fungi and olives
For the mains we got goat cheese ravioli and prosciutto pizza (minus the prosciutto :)  
and for the celebration a bottle of Bisol Colmei Prosecco. 
The fried appetizer was OK and the dipping sauce could use a bit of a kick. The olives and fungi were a hit and thoroughly enjoyed by all the diners.
The mains arrived quickly as well. I just tasted the ravioli and pizza. The ravioli was actually quite good the pizza was ho hum with a soggy center and not the thin crisp finish one craves in an Italian style pizza. 
The Prossecco was very good and I will go as far as saying pick one up when you see it.
Service though quick was inconsistent as the server was new and a bit overwhelmed. 
Overall for the price we paid it was decent (one can pay a lot more for a lot worse Italian food) 
3 Stars."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this restaurant. We liked it so much we went back the next day. Staff is amazing and the food is even better. Pizza is amazing and so is the beet salad - both are perfect for sharing."}
{"text":"Love their meat platters. A better variety than other Italian restaurants I've been to. Their pastas are also delicious and flavourful."}
{"text":"Nice pizza /snack place, pleasant ambiance and not too formal. Fast friendly service. Their pizza Zucca is amazing! 4 stars for overall value"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on Tuesday. Had the gnocchi and it was quite good. Service was very fast. We got in around 11:55 and finished eating by 12:20. My boss had a pizza which he couldn't finish.

Overall it was very good but still a bit over-priced due to the location. Plus it gets quite loud during lunch time."}
{"text":"I have been to both the mercatto in the Eatons center, and this mercatto as well. I prefer this one, it is a bit smaller and doesn't have the same mall crowd as the Eatons center location. 

I really enjoyed my dinner here, from the awesome charcuterie board, to the tasty pizza, yummy cappuchinos and a GREAT bottle of wine. 

I really noticed the quality of ingredients used in the food at mercatto, which is one thing they really seem to understand. If you want a reasonable priced lunch/dinner, give mercatto a try and I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went here for my friends birthday recently and have to say, I was totally underwhelmed!  The place itself is visually attractive which is probably where it scores most of it's points.  The music was off for a while and it was much nicer and not as loud as when the music was on.  We could actually talk to each other without raising our voices.

We were a group of around 11.  It wasn't a crazy busy night, but it wasn't dead either.  We sat at a high table with stools which I have to say were so uncomfortable.  

Our server was incredibly unhelpful, slow, and unfriendly.  When I arrived she didn't offer me a drink. Someone in our party had requested bread for the table and we had to ask twice before it was brought after a really long time.  I asked her a question about one of the dishes when she FINALLY came to take the order, and she just started writing it down, then I asked her about another dish and she asked me if I wanted both or that one instead. I finally gave up on asking her questions.  I ordered the Margarita pizza and asked her to make sure it wasn't burnt or charred.  She didn't smile once.  

The one good thing she did was brought the bills out before the food came out since we were in a rush and it going to take a bit since there were separate bills.  One person got charged for a salad which had never been brought out. They charge 18% for groups, which I would usually say absolutely, but honestly if we had more time I definitely would not have wanted to pay 18% for the service that we got. 

My friend ordered a couple apps for the table.  The one with the cheese and grapes was good, the fried artichoke I think it was, was pretty tasteless and just a heap of fried stuff.  The pizza when it finally came out was burnt on the bottom although the top was pretty good.  The taste was rather bland and there was a lot of tomato sauce, a little bit of cheese and 3 pieces of basil.  It wasn't horrible but I definitely wouldn't recommend it. 

All in all, I would unlikely go back to this place.  With mediocre food, and lousy service it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Came across this place by chance using my phone app while in Toronto for a few days. Delightful experience in every way. Quick service, extremely pleasant staff and really delicious food. Sure wish there was a branch of this place back home in New York... Will be back in Toronto in a few months, already looking forward to a second meal at Locale Mercatto."}
{"text":"I dined here for a business lunch yesterday. Glad we had reservations because the restaurant became full very quickly at 12pm. Although the kitchen turned out our dishes very quickly, the service was lacking throughout the entire meal. We were not greeted by our waiter or asked if we wanted to order drinks. He showed up after 15 minutes asking if we were ready to order food and we never saw our waiter again until he brought us the bill.

Despite the terrible service, the flavour of the food was spot on. I ordered the rigatoni with brisket and pork Bolognese. My pasta was a little more al dente than I like, but the sauce more than made up for it. Overall, this is a convenient location next to my office with great food. I will dine here again."}
{"text":"I heard this is one of the places you need to go in Toronto but to be honest there are so many better restaurant to go. Food does not meet expectations at all."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but hate the service. 

Been a few times. If you get there early (i.e. at or before 11:30am) you'l get great seating, and hopefully get served in a decent timely manner. 

Otherwise you either wait a million years at the door, which doesn't have much of a waiting area, and exteremely difficult when its winter and you don't want to be pushed ouside; or you wait forever at your table. 
I went once with a big group of work folks, and we waited more than an hour for our food. They said it was because they had a sudden influx of take out/delivery orders. I asked for the manager and explained that they should prioritize their waiting in person customers.  After much frustration we got our food and my orichette was overcooked and hard.  They did give me another one on the house. 

Again, the food is GREAT. Just need to find the right time to go."}
{"text":"Stopped into Mercatto after a recommendation from a client in Toronto.  Fantastic Italian food.  Although not the cheapest lunch in the city, they use incredibly fresh ingredients that make a huge difference in italian food (fresh vegetables, meat, and pasta).   I had a ricotta-stuffed gnocci dish which was great.  One of the better italian dishes I've had in a long time.  

The bustling restaurant is packed at around 12 during the work week, but for good reason.   If you're going by yourself or with 1 other person ask to sit at the bar, because you don't have to wait on line and  you are served quickly."}
{"text":"I came for dinner after being turned away from another restaurant in the area. I was a bit worried based on some of the reviews and the general emptiness of the place but I was happy with my meal.

I came in and was seated at the bar, as requested. The bartender was very friendly and nice. The service was outstanding and I could not have asked for more. I got a half bottle of their cabernet. This is why I did not rate five stars. I suppose as an American, I have a particular taste for strong, full-bodied, dry reds. The Italian cab tasted like pinot noir and not particularly great pinot at that. 

I got the calamari and then the steak for dinner. The calamari was fried perfectly, the batter was crispy and the inside was soft. The shishito peppers and lemon created some depth without being overly strong. The steak was prepared perfectly as well, a true medium and the meat was marbled and delicious. The roasted garlic and Brussel sprouts were more like a garnish but added some flavor. 

I was disappointed tiramisu was not on the dinner menu but I got some sort of caramel custard with cherries and almonds and I overlooked it. I would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"The ambience is trendy, modern, and slightly hipster(?). Water is replenished frequently, and the wait staff is knowledgable and friendly. The food is mostly very good. I say mostly because my father's risotto was undercooked. The mushrooms and flavors were palatable, yet the fact that that the risotto was undercooked was a major error in my book. Some other dishes ordered: Margherita pizza-very good-light and flavorful, Handmade ravioli with brown butter sauce-delicious and full of flavor and exciting textures, and the Spaghetti-fresh and better than most. Overall, if you don't mind noise and dim lighting, this is a nice little restaurant that should please most customers."}
{"text":"This was my first experience eating at Mercatto. I noticed immediately that the service was exceptional! From the hostess to our waiter, the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.

For lunch my friend and I enjoyed the following dishes; Antipasti Grande, Diavola and the Costatine.

The Antipasti Grande is an antipastos dish with a variety of cheeses and meats. The waiter was well versed with the items on the plate and the time between ordering and receiving the dish was prompt. The dish was delicious but pricey at $26. 

The Diavola is a spicy meat pizza. Unfortunately the pizza was lukewarm and lacked in flavor. The price of the pizza was $17 and I expected a much more favorable pizza for this price.

Lastly we had the Costantine which is a pasta dish with beef. The dish was enjoyable but was a bit heavy on the salt and to light on the quantity. For $10-$15, I would give this a four or five star but not for $26. On a positive note, the service was exceptional as our server did split the portion into two smaller dishes for my friend and I to enjoy.

If I could give Mercatto a 3-1/2 star I would and if the prices were more reasonable I would definitely give them a 4 star, but unfortunately they have to settle with a 3 star.

Service is always important but it is the food that makes me come back for more :)"}
{"text":"I've always wanted try this place since the interior looked similar to Cluney's in the distillery district. I went on a weekday and it was chill. Service was a little slow but we didn't mind it. We had the burger with fries and the perciatelli. Both was good but the fries had pockets of salt! Super salty + the fries themselves were slightly over fried (on extreme high heat OR old oil) The flavour was okay but the presentation for both was underwhelming. It was a normal experience since Italian is such a common cuisine, there was no wow factor like Gusto101 or Taverna Mercatto. Not enough character to the food. It was just okay."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it was packed! Looking around the food looked nice and we decided to order a pizza to share for lunch. The service was pretty average and the lamb sausage pizza wasn't very tasty at all. It was just some base, sauce and a few leaves with a tiny bit of lamb mince. It was also very noisy and we could hardly hear each other across the table."}
{"text":"I Decided to come her for a nice Valentine's lunch.  Since I've passed this place so many times, enough was enough.  The ambience and decor very much feels like a more rustic mercatto/ mercado. HOwever it took us some time to finally get our waiter, waitress, i suppose due to lunch time crowds.  Nonetheless the food was great, not SPECTACULAR, however found the 50z wine quite over priced
Here's the break down:

Appetizer:
Crostini: foraged mushrooms w mozarella & balsamico
4/5

Main:
Zucca: butternut squash, spinach, fortina, walnuts 
3/5

I may come back for dinner just to get a better idea, but its NOTHING OUT OF THIS WORLD, but a cute place to bring a date."}
{"text":"Do you like onion and garlic breath?
Do you like undercooked risotto?
Do you like mussels that tastes fishy and like they've been sitting in the fridge for too long?

Then get the seafood risotto. 

If you're not a fan of the aforementioned (like me), stay away from seafood risotto. It was just plain bad. The onion and garlic lingered for hours. The risotto was hard to the bite. From watching lots of Hell's Kitchen, I get that risotto is hard to get right but for $26, I expected more. The seafood was also far from fresh. 

Apart from the risotto, the service was great and I dig the decor and the open style kitchen.

We ordered our food earlier in the day because my dining group had another activities planned in the evening and were short on time. The food was ready when we showed up even though our party was not. Mercatto was very accommodating of our request. 

Can't comment on the other food but that everything is on the expensive side and the quality is not there. I might give Mercatto another try, perhaps the other items are better, but until then, the risotto gets a 2.5."}
{"text":"Their pastas were decent.....sandwiches are okay...especially for lunch.    The prices are a tad high for a normal lunch, but nice with a bunch of girl friends.  

The reason why they get a 2, is the service is horrible.   Our server seemed like she was having a really bad day....not once did she smile, and it took a long time before we could get anyone's attention....and that's hard, we are like 5 hungry asian girls from Hong Kong. 

Anyways....if you want a quick lunch, this place isn't for your.  If you want decent service, this isn't the place either.    But I mean...if you wait long enough, had all the time in the world to wait for your food, the food is okay....not the best I've ever had, definitely kind of expensive for the price.....but it's decent.     Keep in mind pasta portions are kind of small (we tiny asian girls commented that we could've eaten 3 of the same plates)....if you prefer larger portions, get the sandwich with shoestring fries.

Let's just say if I had to recommend a good lunch place for business this wouldn't be it.   I can name a dozen of other places in less then 20 seconds that would top this one."}
{"text":"Mercatto is a nice, upscale lunch destination for when you're looking for a change from the usual Bay Street food court fare.  It's a beautiful restaurant with crystal chandeliers, modern touches, and reliable service.
My personal favourite menu item is the pesto tagliatelle, though it's a bit oily for my taste (even when I requested minimal oil). I will forgive the oil because everything else in it is quite delicious, especially the sundried tomatoes- they're only partially sundried, making them extra tasty.  Any of Mercatto's pizzas are also a great bet, and I hear they offer some pretty decent take-out sandwiches at lunch, though I've never tried them myself.
2 warnings: 
1) this place is insanely busy at lunchtime- expect to wait for a table. Dinner is much quieter.
2) be prepared to bring the smell of garlic back to your office, because it will stick to your clothes!"}
{"text":"Great meal tonight. 

Consistently create good food.  I had two apps for dinner. the calamari was cooked but could have stood about 30 more seconds in the fryer to have the batter be a touch crispier. The other was the meatballs/ will order again without hesitation. 

Also had a dessert of chocolate cheesecake-almond biscotti crust, a raspberry compote and a dollop of cream. It was beautifully presented and delicious. 

The service was great, staff attentive but not overly cloying."}
{"text":"I came here for a late lunch - missing out on the gorgeous suits of Bay st - before setting up our signature campaign over on Nathan Philip Square.

We had the lay of the land and selected a booth at the far end. I ordered the prosciutto pizza and shared the calamari with a colleague. The calamari came with the lemon and the chili sauce to the sauce. Luckily, my colleague also likes lemon and I squirted the lemon on the dish. That is sufficient for me. I am not interested in the chili sauce dip. I thought the calamari served their purpose.

The prosciutto pizza reminded me of a more \"artisan\" prosciutto pizza from Il Sogno's. It's shape, prosciutto, arugula and cheese portions were carefully placed in a disarrayed fashion. In the end, I ate it all. It was good.

Before leaving, we used the washroom. I found the washroom a bit of a disappointment. Poorly lit and with no napkins to dry your hands."}
{"text":"I've seen several versions of this restaurant around Toronto, but haven't been to one until today. Located in the Financial District, you'll be dining with swanky bankers, business men/women with briefcases, and really good looking people dressed in really good looking suits. It was pretty packed for lunch, so be sure to make a reservation.

I've gone today with a friend for a lunch date as it was nearby and didn't look too shabby. Actually that was one of the best traits of the place.

DIAVOLA: spicy sopressata, fior di latte, san marzano / 17

Actually really good pizza. I don't doubt it's antipasti, but in my opinion, the pizza had a lot of flavour and sauce that sticks to your face but it just tastes so good (warning for dates!!). It was also actually spicy, and I'm the type of person that chugs away at least a half of a Tabasco bottle for a meal (Nando's is one of my favourite places). *Almost* as good as Pizzeria Libretto for roughly the same price and in downtown Toronto. 

TORTIGLIONI: crispy pork belly, red onion, capers, tomato / 16

Not too much of a pasta fan, but it's decent here. Good meat to pasta proportions. However a bit on the salty and dry side for both the pasta and the pork. It was more \"scratchy\" than crispy, but it was okay. 

I guess the only issue I had with this place was the service. Our waters weren't even filled within the first half an hour and we were sitting NEXT to the water post! The servers also took a while to finally notice us to take our orders. I understand that it is a bit busy, especially at lunch time, but it would be nice to be acknowledged that someone would be coming our way. The servers weren't necessarily rude, but a smile here and there wouldn't of hurt anybody.

Overall, decent place. But I probably wouldn't try another one of the chain, considering there are so many other options."}
{"text":"I've had Mercatto many times previously and have thought it was ok. But my last trip was terrible. I ordered spaghetti and it was over cooked and dry. How can an Italian restaurant screw up spaghetti?

I think Mercatto is serving very standard Italian fare and getting away with it because of their great location!

P.S. I've been to other locations but in my opinion - this one is the worst. Eaton centre and Toronto Street locations are a LOT better."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Solid Italian wine options. Loved the pecorino romano with shishito peppers and the orchiette pasta and the canoli. Little pricey but tasty!"}
{"text":"Booked a lunch meeting at this location. The restaurant is very noisy (has zero sound insulation).  Waiting staff were friendly and efficient. I had the Ravioli and my guest had the shrimp pasta. The tomato based ravioli sauce was extremely watery and tasteless. Overall the food quality was sub par. If you don't have a starter, you will leave hungry. Average per head was $28 without alcohol.  I do not recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"It was a busy Tuesday lunch hour.  My friend and I were deciding where to go in the last week considering that we hadn't seen each other for quite some time.  He works in the Financial District, and I work in the hospital (Discovery District area).  Considering that I lacked meetings around the lunch time period, I decided to hop onto the TTC, meet up with him at his workplace and walk on over to Mercatto.  (Not only that, we were thinking of a good place to eat - sit-in restaurant - but would take reservations; hence why we avoided going to Terroni). 

He never went to Mercatto, so I quickly OpenTabled it, and ended up eating there.

We were quickly seated considering that we had reservations.  Our waiter came to greet us quickly and brought us bread in less than 5 minutes.  I ordered the orecchiette and my friend ordered the garganelli.  About 15-20 minutes in, we got our food.  The server was great in telling us that if we were in a rush, getting pizza wouldn't be the best idea (my friend wanted pizza; but he had a meeting around 1 PM).  The food was delicious - but I think I would've enjoyed it much more if I wasn't so rushed during lunch.  What can you do - it was a power lunch!

(Side note: my friend and I ended up accidentally switching our lunches around without even knowing -- both lunches were so good that we didn't realize this occurrence until 4-5 hours later).  

It was a tad noisy, but this is where you go for power lunches in the Financial District.  They were fast and quick to come with the food, so I can't complain.  I liked the ambiance at the Toronto St. and the one closer to mine; but it's definitely the community of people (and timing!) of when you go."}
{"text":"The location is pretty good. Right on Bay Street. The food was good too.

We decided to combine two small plates each instead of one main course so that we could try multiple dishes. I had the Octopus and seafood dish which I cannot find on their website now. It was quite flavourful. My friend had POLPETTE wild boar meatballs, and FUNGHI warm porcini mushroom salad, arugula, spinach pecorino. She seemed happy too.

For dessert, we had PANETTONE BREAD PUDDING salted caramel, mascarpone gelato. It was okay. 

All in all, a good meal."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out this place. We came here in a group of 4. We were a little on the rush as we had tickets to a movie right after, so we only ordered 4 main dishes. Two of us ordered the CAPPELLACCI (duck, truffle sugo, honey mushrooms $24), another ordered the RIGATONI (short rib and brisket bolognese $18) and another ordered the TAGLIERINI DI MARE (lobster, shrimp, fennel pangrattato $27). We all agreed that flavour was just okay, nothing really stood out. And we also all agreed that the portion was a little small for the price charged. The portion for the Cappellacci looked like it was for kid. We all left there still hungry and had to order extra food at the movie. I don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"This place gets BUSY during the lunch hour so you'd best make reservations. Arrive after 12 without a reservation and you'll likely have to wait for a table.

In terms of the food, the menu offerings aren't that special. More or less your standard Italian dishes. I opted for a pizza, which unfortunately came out seriously overcooked and pretty much burnt. The crust was crunchy with some nice big black bubbles all over the place. Honestly, no responsible, self-respecting kitchen would even allow this to be sent out.

One of my companions had to send a dish back for other reasons and the service was quite accommodating, so 1 star for that. Being the sucker I am, I just soldier'd through my abysmal pizza and decided to Yelp about it afterwards to vent.

Other than that, I did find the service to be a touch slow and a bit spotty in terms of attentiveness. Part of that may be due to the volume of customers at the time, so kudos to our server for doing her best, but there's an issue that needs to be addressed here by restaurant management. 

Note that this location will be closed until early June 2016 for renovations."}
{"text":"Has been developing into a much better spot since it opened. 

Decent food (the burger and the steak tartare are quite the stars), decent beer (and rotating micro brews) beer selection, and many other menu options. 

A bit pricey but great for a business lunch"}
{"text":"They have some good vegetarian options though perhaps not as appealing as they could be. I had the spaghetti with a tomato sauce and buffala di mozarella. The pasta was perfectly cooked (thank goodness) and the sauce was spectacular. Now what I didn't get was the blob of cheese just there in the centre of my pasta dish. It was stretchy and slightly cold and just had no place in the dish. I never though I'd say this but, the cheese ruined what was the perfect dish. 

The service was quick and easy, we had to ask for bread which was a little annoying and the waitress kept giving one of the other diners suggestions WITH ham even though he asked for recommendations that didn't have it. 

Overall, I think that the restaurant is great and it has potential to be fantastic. For now I say \"A-OK\""}
{"text":"They recently changed their concept, to be honest liked it better before but nonetheless it's a great lunch spot and never uncomfortably packed.  Had the tuna pasta dish, to be honest it was a little too salty and fishy for my taste.  
The pizzas are always good and a safe bet."}
{"text":"I wanted to take a moment to thank you, Mercatto, and more specifically John and our server, Andrew. But the real \"thank you\" goes to Andrew.  We had a delightful experience at Mercatto on Friday, the 21st of December.  Andrew was unpretentious and charming and attentive.  A rare combination in this industry!  He was never pushy, always informative, and often funny.  He was there when we wanted him to be and not nagging about when he wasn't needed.  It is a bit of a tight-rope walk to attend to guests, be there when needed and know when to give some space.  I have worked as a server for more years than I care to admit, and I was most impressed.  I was pleased with the food, the pace, the environment, the music selection, the volume of the music, the cleanliness, the professionalism--the whole experience.  

Andrew was not visibly frustrated that our party, in its entirety, didn't arrive sharply at 6pm.  He was not irritated when some of our guests only ordered water to drink.  Nor was he ruffled by the myriad of questions that I asked about the menu.  A job well done, through and through, and when I'm next in Mercatto, I will surely request Andrew's section.  

Happy Holidays to all.  Thank you for making our small holiday party as enjoyable as it was.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is a lot worse than I remember....

I used to come here before they changed everything up. It was the perfect Italian lunch spot - excellent location, solid food, great service. But it seems that Locale Mercatto is now a shell of its former self.

For starters, and as others have mentioned, the entrance is hard to find. 

The menu is a lot worse. They no longer do pizzas. They do panini sandwiches but if you ask me, that's practically a write-off when you go to an Italian restaurant.

They used to bring fresh bread to your table, they no longer do this. They even used to offer fresh parmesan with their pastas; you guessed it, they no longer do this either.

I chose to eat the Spaghetti di Mare. It was okay, a little blander than expected. In fact, if you compare the picture of my dish to other reviewers, mine looks much drier and less creamy. 

Where it really went downhill was when a couple friends ordered the dish consisting of salmon and rice. It was lukewarm at best, so we asked a server if it was supposed to be hot. She said yes, so we let her know that it wasn't. She offered to have the kitchen remake it, but instead, they seemed to just throw the food in a pan, mushing everything together, breaking down the salmon. Not a big deal since we're not ones to complain, but it seemed unprofessional to get re-served a dish that looked the way it did (see picture). Plus, we really didn't need the added attitude from the other server (2 people were serving us).

Simply put, avoid this place."}
{"text":"I headed to Mercatto for dinner, to catch up with an old friend. The restaurant was busy, but mercifully not too loud. They were also playing some great music - \"Home\" by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros was a standout track.

I had the gnocchi with duck ragu, which was brilliant. It's cooked with peas, a vegetable I normally hate, but even they were absolutely delicious. My friend had a solid prosciutto pizza, and we shared a chocolate and salty caramel pudding that was also quite good - although it could have used more of the rich caramel. The evening was topped off with a perfect, foamy cappuccino. 

I can't comment on the lunch rush, but I'd certainly recommend Mercatto for dinner."}
{"text":"So i think i hate Mercatto's now. Completely. 
After having gone to every single Mercatto's location now (always a damned work thing), i am convinced this is the worst location out of them all. The two times i have gone, they have really shown poor cooking abilities with the food.
The pasta is always undercooked, the rissotto is watery, the scallops are burnt instead of seared, i don't even know where to begin. Just don't go."}
{"text":"VIBE 
The Bay St. location is going to be filled with a lot of suits but after 9-5 and on weekends (yes, now open weekends!) it's a more diverse crowd. 
The staff here are fantastic. They know what they're doing. 

WE ATE/DRANK
I've been going to this location for years for lunch and back then they always served an amazing array of pastas, pizzas and great paninis + mini salad combos. I can't comment on it now as I no longer work in the area. 

On this particular occasion, we had the charcuterie and it was fantastic. You can get a chef's selection and were able to try out this creamy blue cheese that did not over power.  What's also interesting about this location (not sure about the others) is that they sell wines they're no longer using or discontinuing at discounted prices. So we got a bottle we normally wouldn't get to and had a great and tipsy experience. High Five on a great idea. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
I'm always a fan of original locations (see my review on Indigo Yonge and Eg) but I fear that despite our great experience this one time that on the regular it's not as good as it was. I'm not sure if it has to do with the expansion of the restaurant into a chain. That said, I've had a lot of good lunch memories here."}
{"text":"That's right, five stars.

Italian food is my favourite genre, and I'm highly critical of Italian restaurants.  This place exceeded my expectations both in terms of service and food.  

I had the ricotta ravioli, and the flavours were perfectly blended.  Cheese that was flavourful but not overwhelming, and just the right quantity and blend of spice & olive oil.  The texture was a pleasure as well - clearly freshly made pasta.  

The service was excellent - I note that other reviewers have not had the same experience.  I went on a Thursday night & was seated immediately.  The waiter was attentive & even brought us two wine samples when we were unable to decide on a wine.  

I will certainly be back here!"}
{"text":"Mercatto is a fairly generic Italian restaurant chain.  This outpost in the Financial District is just right for bankers and tourists alike, especially for lunch.

The menu has all the options you would expect--antipasti, pizza, pasta, etc.  Did I say pizza?!!  Look no further in the menu!  8-10 kinds!  The margherita, zucca (with butternut squash and spinach), siciliano and diavola to name a few.  I have tried the margherita and zucca.  All pizzas here are thin crust (not super thin though).  The bread is excellent, the sauce less so.  And they use great cheese.  I can finish their pizza in about 10-15 minutes but can likely not have anything else on the menu.  An honorable mention also for their friendly service with a smile.

Go to Mercatto.  Ignore everything but the pizzas.  Rinse and repeat.  Your tubby self will thank me for the advice."}
{"text":"It's been years since I last dined here and I literally walked past the resto.   They have changed the name to Locale Mercatto and also the entrance to the restaurant.  If you didn't have a magnifying glass with you, you will probably miss the Mercatto sign which is right underneath the huge Locale sign. 

I loved my seafood spaghetti! The sauce was a creamy texture made from fennel seeds! I thought that very unique and it tasted amazing.  What I didn't like was the service.  I had to wait 15 mins for the server to give me a glass of water. When our pasta arrived, we weren't offered any fresh pepper or Parmesan, I had to ask for it.  In terms of the price, my seafood pasta cost $25 which is average however the food portion was pretty small. I never finish my pasta but I did here."}
{"text":"Went during lunch hour, place was packed but thankfully we had reservations. Place is very nice. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Food came relatively quickly.

But that's where the awesomeness stopped and mediocrity began the moment the food came into my mouth. Saw the reviews of the pasta and being a pasta snob I didn't want any from a chain so I went with a safe option... their burger/fries.... talk about whiffing on that one. 

Asked for Medium rare, got rare. Fine, I can deal with that but what I can't deal with is bland meat and basically just eating calories. Food should be enjoyable to eat, this wasn't. It was a sad burger. Fries were OK.

Asked for an Amaretto Sour and it was decent.

Not sure why this place is packed, overall we all felt our meals were mediocre."}
{"text":"Decent but not great. You can definitely do better for Italian food in this price category (hello Terroni), but the food is decent. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here and the place is loud, but you won't feel like you got ripped off either"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place the other night while looking for a different restaurant and boy am I glad we decided to stop and feed my Italian food craving. This is the 2nd Mercator location I've been to and again, I am impressed. 

I'll start off by saying that their kitchen was almost closed, but they seated us anyway and still provided us service with a full smile on their face and a great sense of humour. 

SERVICE: 5/5 seated promptly and attentive without being overbearing. Knowledgeable with menu and wine pairing. Very helpful with selections on menu.

ATMOSPHERE: 5/5 Ambience was great, Crowd was smart business casual. 

DRINK: 4/5 standard wine list and beer selection 

FOOD: 4/5 would go back just for the prosciutto appetizer a salad and glass of wine. The gnocchi fritti went so well with fresh shaved prosciutto and shaved parmigiana ..  The pasta however could use a bit more work in terms of flavour and temperature .. I was expecting a little more flavour from the duck ravioli, however the honey mushrooms were delicious. Their lasagna was delicious too, however, the sauce was a bit cold on the plate and it is vegetarian- probably our fault for not checking first.. but it was still good nonetheless.

I would defiantly return just to have that appetizer though.. and to try the other menu items.

Great job Locale Mercatto and staff!"}
{"text":"Yet again I was craving some Italian and have wanted to check this place out for a while. Going on a -15 Friday night was a good idea because the place was not very packed (about half full at most), so you would get good service and hot food.

I would compare Mercatto to Terroni, only has a much different vibe to it. Mind you, I'm only taking the Queen W place as the comparison, but I found Mercatto to be much more urban and marche like. What the heck did I say? More urban in the sense that it was modern looking and the waiters were very easy going as our waiter was dressed in jeans and t-shirt. Very pleasant staff. Marche like? well the inside was wooden tables and chairs in a hollowed out industrial type frame. I can see this place being really noisy when it is packed. There would be lots of echo.

The food is comparable to Terroni (but I liked Terroni), only not as much selection. I am sure that there would be a little something for everyone to try. I enjoyed their Antipasti Misti, which included 2 choices of deli meat, cheese, and antipasto.

What really stood out for me was the way they served wine. It basically works like fountain pop if you are ordering just a single glass. I know this sounds nasty but it would take to long to explain here. I was also impressed that a lad came in by himself and was talking with the waitress about a selection of wine. She brought to him 4 glasses with about 1-2oz in them to try. The guy selected his wine and when she went to get him a glass full she said, and you can finish all those up.

Don't necessarily expect your socks to be knocked off, but this is a place everyone can enjoy"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch today, on her recommendation. As she's vegan, she's had to know exactly where she can go to get a good bite to eat. 

We both had the spaghetti. The waiter was very accommodating to my friend's diet, knowing exactly what needed to be removed from her dish as soon as vegan was mentioned. This is not always the case, and can be quite a hassle. 

Both dishes arrived promptly, though we had to ask for bread, which was a bit odd. The spaghetti was sublime. Much nicer than I expected. The tomato sauce had some nice hints to it, and the generous helping of cheese underneath was an unexpected, but perfect addition. While at first I thought the portion small, I found myself satisfied by the end. 

While the food and service was excellent, I do have to rate the experience four stars due to the seating. Friday lunch is understandably a busy time. While we did not have long to wait (~10 min), the table we were given was small, and jutted out from the main dining area. In fact, we were right next to the small crowd of people waiting for their own table! It made for a very cramped and uncomfortable experience. My advice to Mercatto is to remove that table entirely. I'd much rather way the extra 5 minutes for a table with a little more peace and quiet. 

Otherwise, a very delicious lunch! Avoid the table by the entrance, and you'll have a satisfying experience."}
{"text":"Ive been to Mercatto many times before... this was the worst, unfortunately.
It was myself and 2 other friends. We came primarily for nibbles and drinks. We ordered, wine, beer, and an assortment of shared plates: margherita pizza, cheese antipasto, and their gnudi app. The gnudi was delicious! but jeez small. we each got 1 ball. small little delicious ricotta goodness...but definately too small. 
the cheese antipasto was okay...small again but whatever. we asked for bread. twice. the waitress didnt seem enthused by this request as she obviously ignored it the first time. The second time she just gave us a dirty look and walked away. Another person returned with cold brea dna olive oil. Dude...if the breads cold atleast put some balsamic with that oil. the oil wasnt even good. it had an old taste to it. 
the pizza was okay...notghing fancy. 90.00 for everything. wouldnt come back after such rude service. Its just bread! lol jeez. 

Note: the other times I did come i enjoyed the food, esp. the pasta's very much and the service was always helpful and friendly. Also - they have a rpetty cool wine system by the bar. sittign there and ordering a few different glasses is always fun."}
{"text":"Yum, yum! Great service, lovely food. Interesting salads, appetizers and entrees! I would go back if I could!!"}
{"text":"Went during lunch hour it was very busy. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. That's where the awesomeness stopped and mediocrity began food was bad: bland steak and overpriced mushrooms. No steak sauce - wow. We were placed at the bar where water was slowly dripping on us from condensation from a pipe above us. They did comp us for the meal for our sides and drinks. Unfortunately, it didn't take the taste of vapid food out of my mouth. Won't go again."}
{"text":"Someone's got some catching up to do - this is certainly no Mercatto on Toronto Street (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/mercatto-toronto#hrid:BfmxobTP-54pUWJpReGw9w). 

Our server either didn't know how OR didn't have the upper body strength to properly grate parmagiano reggiano, which was a little awkward. 

Menu is different from location to location and a bit more limited here than at the Toronto restaurant. I ordered the Ravioli stuffed with ricotta and herbs with brown butter sage ($14). I saw evidence of sage on my plate but other than that this dish wasn't at all flavourful, and I wouldn't order it again or urge anyone else to. My Italian bf makes it better.

Decor is very beautiful and vibrant; from the outside you'd be tempted to walk in blindly based on how fun the atmosphere looks. I noticed there were specials on a chalkboard after I had already ordered - information that our server certainly should have shared with us? A shame because they all looked much more enticing to me than what I saw on the regular menu."}
{"text":"Terrible. Only came here once for lunch and order the gnocchi.

I was drawn by the duck, but was a bit disappointed. Was not very appetizing. * sad *"}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that I think Mercatto is slightly overpriced and a bit too noisy, we had a great meal and great experience. They accommodated my mom and sister's gluten free needs, and kept us updated about when our table would be ready (we waited quite a bit for a table, but we had 6 people over the lunch hour so it was to be expected.) 

I had the margarita pizza, which was fantastic. Everyone else enjoyed their meals too."}
{"text":"Really classy decor inside, not too loud can talk to like 10 people, the service was good, and the food really good! The carbonara was awesome because the pancetta was a bit seared so each bite was divine, got their cocktail pink drink that's not too sweet not too bitter it was just right and good another girl at my table tried mine and ordered one herself, and the connolo dessert was a very nice flavour and again not too sweet it was smooth. Definitely recommend!"}
