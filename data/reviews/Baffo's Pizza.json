{"text":"had dinner here because of \"You Gotta Eat Here\"  very disappointed.  The caprese salad was bland;  no flavour:  bad quality tomatoes, the cheese tasted like wax.  For an Italian restaurant you'd expect the tomatoes, cheese and olive oil to taste at least good.  Then had the sea food pasta in a tomato cream sauce, not good.  It was drowning in the cream sauce, so it over powered the sea food.  It was also serve in a angular bowl that made it hard for eating.  I first asked for smoked salmon and soft shell crab which were promoted in the TV show, they didnt have any I was really counting on those.

All in all Olive Garden is better.  Better value better flavour.  I dont know what that guy in YOu Gotta Eat here saw in this restaurant.  We drove all the way from Etobicoke just eat at this place."}
{"text":"Great pizza has made this place a keeper. Best pizza for miles. Nice atmosphere upstairs and a takeout downstairs. Patio has noisy kitchen fan so we don't use it."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere.  Pizza was fantastic.  Beer sampler was great. The sweet Calzone dessert we tried was not so good however.  All three of us thought it was an odd over-sweet tasting paste oozing out from an odd-tasting baked calzone crust.  Will try another dessert next time."}
{"text":"Baffo's has done a great job with this establishment, food was excellent, server was not great, and prices were fair. Mark B in the kitchen is the best!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on a show on Food network. The guy went there for pizza and pasta and they featured (as far as i remember) Lobster pizza, lobster Pasta, and the Famous Banana split pizza. 

We wanted to try it out so we drove from Downtown toronto. 

We were 5 and on a saturday night, took about 20 min to sit down.  We ordered three pizzas (including the lobster one) and one pasta (Salmon and Caviar)
the pizzas were good, but nothing extraordinary. The lobster pizza was average. None of us was terribly impressed. The Salmon pasta was very good, i couldnt taste the caviar though. maybe it was more for the presentation as there was a dallop on there. I guess the cream sauce drowned the flavor. 

Then we ordered the banana Split pizza, which comes with Brownies, pineapple nuts and whipped cream on top.  That was something. Pretty good. unique dessert pizza. Must try."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim after hearing about this place from a friend and was pleasantly surprised. 
Great menu choices, and very fast service. Started with the pasta fagioli which was very rich sand tasty. Better than homemade. 
Bread was very fresh and hot. 
Mediterranean seafood pasta was a perfect portion size. The mussels and clams were very fresh and tender. Shrimp and scallop was cooked perfectly. I've had seafood pastas where the seafood is tough and over cooked but not at this place. 
The only reason for not giving 5 stars really had nothing to do with the food but because the server didn't seem very enthusiastic or friendly."}
{"text":"Service really good
Tried the Lobster Calzone and the bread is delicious BUT the taste of the lobster i don't know where it went :s.. 
I recommend this place because of its pasta and pizzas, no lobsters please"}
{"text":"Featured on the food network's \"you gotta eat here\" (sort of Canada's version of diners drive ins and dives), I went in to Baffos with expectations of guy fieti proportions. 
Unfortunely, I said expectations were not met. 
It was just good. 
Decent, pizza, pasta and other Italian fare. 
My calzone was supposed to have Italian sausage and churizzo, but only teeny bits were present. Disappointing...
Excellent calamari though, I must say.  Best I've had anywhere 
The atmosphere is warm and inviting, and our server was polite and attentive.
Would definitely choose this place over a chain restaurant for a casual family dinner out, but I won't be a regular."}
{"text":"In case you decide to make a trip out...This place has closed their doors for good."}
