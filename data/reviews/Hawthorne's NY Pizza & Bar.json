{"text":"My wife and I have been to this Hawthorne's a few times, and though they've always been good, our first visit was noteworthy for being perfectly executed.  Excellent service: the waitstaff has a good knowledge of the menu and is able to answer questions and make recommendations when you're not sure about your selection. Consistently quick with bringing food to the table, clearing dishes, and taking drink orders. Great waitstaff are great for NOT being noteworthy, they just make the meal progress and everything happens at the right time, with very little fuss.  The pies are excellent, try the special-white (ricotta, pesto, sundried tomatoes), and the plate of meatballs as an appetizer. The food has been consistently better than most other pizza places in the area.  The beer selection is good, with a couple options on the list for beer-snobs, and not unreasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have 1 more data point for takeout a couple weeks ago.  The garlic knots were not burned, and did have some oil but were indeed 'light oil' as requested.  I request light oil because by the time you get full-oil knots home they are often soggy and not enjoyable.  full-oil works ok in a restaurant where it just goes to the table.  The pizza was also excellent: not burned.  So great job!  Thanks!    This whole process through Yelp worked; where I wrote a review, the restaurant saw it and made a change; now things are good again.  I'm kind of excited about this :)."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 150 times and every time has been a 5 star experience. Big shout out to Tim and Sadie who exemplify what high-end service should be."}
{"text":"Love this place. Pizza, pasta, stromboli, wings, garlic knots......can't go wrong with any of them."}
{"text":"Lunch slice and salad with blue cheese. Pizza was bbq chicken and my extra anchovies. Good thin crust pizza, but chicken must have run when anchovies were added. Salad was fresh and good. Blue cheese dressing is a 4 out of 10.  Gorgonzola pasta with chicken is delicious. Must try! Served with Penne pasta. I might have preferred thin spaghetti. Expensive. Waiter is faster than a speeding bullet taking the order. Give me someone my speed that knows the food. Price:$$"}
{"text":"Usually eat at the Carmel Rd or 7th St locations. Both are very good. Never had a meal I didn't enjoy.  Tried the Mint Hill location and had the worst Sicilian pizza experience.  Ordered from the road and took it home. Pizza was awful. Tried to contact manager but no one was responsive.  Update: Marketing Manager did follow up and offered to make up for the bad meal. Greatly appreciated.  Again, the food at the other Hawthorne's restaurants is very good. Best NY style pizza in Charlotte. My review is for this location only!"}
{"text":"Worst calzone ever (and calzones are my favorite thing to order at pizza places, so I've had a lot before)! Crust is sloppily folded over the ingredients inside and there was barely any ricotta to be found in the ingredients. You typically find calzones pinched together at the edges so as to create a baked \"pocket\" of ingredients, but this one was not. Do NOT, absolutely do not, order one with spinach in it because, unlike normal pizza locations, they use frozen spinach instead of fresh spinach leaves. It made my entire calzone taste absolutely terrible.   Super disappointed in this experience!"}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to visit Hawthorne's Pizza again recently and must say the food and experience was absolutely wonderful! ! I ordered the wings which were nice and flavorful on the outside and moist in the inside, in fact they were probably some of the best wings Ive had. The kids enjoyed their meals and the service was excellent. Thank you Hawthorne's pizza for listening to your customer feedback and we will certainly be back!!"}
{"text":"Finding good pizza in the south is a tough task. Though i dont think this is it. I do think that they make a pretty good pizza. Their sauce is something to be desired. But overall a decent pizza. They also have some standard amricanized italian dishes that are tastey and hit the spot but again nothing special. Depending on the time and day families are rampant, and can be tough to be seated on weekends. Prices are right above that borderline cheap but good range."}
{"text":"Good food for a decent value. I would give the fifth star if they had better wings...or hot sauce."}
{"text":"Stopped by to have some snacks with friends had not been here in awhile and the food was amazing! Julia behind the bar took excellent care of us and the mussels were to die for! So yummy! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"From what I've seen, the Italian food seems to be pretty good but being on a diet, I order salads.  Do not waste your money on a salad here.  I got a simple side salad with shrimp.  The greens were partly brown, tomatoes were literally soggy and the six tiny shrimp still had the tails on them.  I wasted ten dollars on this 'meal.'  The service was good but again, third bad experience with salads.  I 've gone here because of the convenience but from now will run through a fast food chain before going back to Hawthorne's."}
{"text":"I ordered the bar pie and was surprised. It was actually quite good. The crust was thin and perfectly crisp. The cheese was of excellent quality. However, the sauce was unremarkable. I literally do not remember it. Don't mistake me though, I would still order pizza from Hawthorne's again and would recommend it. The sauce wasn't bad, just not a standout.  A highlight though were the waffle fries - delicious, brown & crispy but still tender on the inside. I could've made a meal out of fries and a salad. Others in my party ordered the lobster ravioli pasta dish and while they raved over the flavors, the small number of ravioli put a damper on their enjoyment. Overall, this was a solid dining experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most disgusting attempt at Italian food I've ever tried and I've eaten Dominos.   As a person who grew up on long island and Brooklyn, I know what it's supposed to taste like.   After waiting an hour when told 20 minutes the pizza was ice cold and the dough tasted like a Pillsbury special not fresh. The sauce tasted like out had half a pound of sugar in it.   The Caprese salad had mozzerella cheese that's days old and has no flavor and was sent with a balsamic vinaigrette instead of vinegar and that was after I dug it out under the massive pile of cilantro used to cover up the poor attempt at food. The manager then attempted to tell me it was basil but backed off when I told her I grow basil and know the difference. Basil is right, cilantro is wrong.  The mozzerella sticks weren't even cooked, literally bit into a frozen center as if it was either frozen or in the fridge all day.   When I cornered them as to the age of the food, there was no debate.   Really pathetic. Manager ended up refunding the entire order.   Stick with Due Amici, the manager may be a jerk but they know how to do Italian right."}
{"text":"more of a thank you than a review. hawthorne's hosted my daughter's post-season soccer party and were outstanding in every way - the food was great as usual but the staff were outstanding. I can't imagine trying to wrangle 30+ people (most under the age of 7) flawlessly, but they made it look easy. my sincere thanks to the managers, Julia and Dana as well as to our server, Amanda... I'll continue to recommend hawthorne's to any and all that want a great neighborhood pizza place."}
{"text":"First and foremost ... GARLIC KNOTS A-MA-ZING!!! I loved them! We had the God Father, New Yorker, salad, and torts. All great! I'm craving those knots now though. Service was 4/5 stars but not bad. They need to pre-bus more. If you have a free hand take a dirty plate. That's just Common sense. If you don't your lazy. Other than that minor annoyance all good. ;)"}
{"text":"Good menu, reasonably priced. A couple of good selections, as far as wine (but check the freshness) Out in the middle of nowhere with lots of construction. Forget the GPS for now"}
{"text":"I had a craving, so I stopped to see if they had slices available at around 430pm and was told they did not which I totally understood.   Then I asked if I could order for takeout.  I was shown the door that I needed to exit back into the cold air to walk to another door to place my order.   If I had been able to place my order on the spot I would have had a drink at the bar while I waited.   As it was, I went out the door and talked myself out of the pizza I had planned on ordering, got in my car and left.  :("}
{"text":"I stopped by one night ordering the Manicotti, this was to be my last meal before having my wisdom teeth extracted. Disappointed is not even the word. I received 3 pasta rolls in a tin that indicated prior to my opening it that I was going to receive a large portion, there was no sauce. I don't think I'll be going here again. I ordered a pizza from the a while back and for the price I paid for both meals and the disappointment I had when eating them just doesn't Warrent a third try from me."}
{"text":"would give 4.5 stars if possible  Side salad Grilled chicken sandwich w/ house balsamic  Elizabeth pizza   We have been a few times and the pizza is always good, this time we also tried a sandwich and side salad, both exceeded expectations.  The house balsamic is fantastic which made both the salad and sandwich terrific, pizza was very good as always.  Attentive service, awesome lunch, looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Hawthorne's Pizza for years.  To say the pizza is good here is an understatement.  I've always loved the pizza and different pasta dishes, the waiters have always been friendly and given good service.   I've recently moved back to the neighborhood and I'm going to all of my favorite spots again.  Hawthorne's what's happened?  The food is good, but your service has fallen flat.  I waited after a few visits to review you, thinking maybe you guys had an off day.  But after three recent visits your waiters seem uninterested.   Pros:   YOUR FOOD is AMMMAZING ....I'll be back no doubt! Not so pros:  Your service - I'm disappointed - three times now.  I want the Hawthorne's I remember!"}
{"text":"Hawthorne's pizza was fairly decent, but *very* greasy (I think they used cheaper cheddar cheese mixed with the mozzarella).  Much more expensive than I'd expected!  Service was polite and timely, though.  I probably won't order from them again."}
{"text":"I'm yet to find anything on the menu I don't like, but the Pizza is top notch.  Wings, deserts, and salads are also fantastic.  My Thursday is not complete unless it includes a fresh pie from Hawthornes!"}
{"text":"We have had the best experience  eating at hawthorns.  The staff is fantastic and fun, the beer selection is great the food is ok, but I look for the atmosphere.  We have fun knowing that Blair and Jenna and Cory are going to be around on he weekends.  We met Blair 6 years ago and what a great server and friend she as turned out to be.  It is nice to walk into a restaurant and everyone knows your name(cheers) and it's a great place to relax.  I would highly recommend Hawthorns on Ridge road for a great time and remember to ask for Blair because she is the best!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places. But due to the fruit flies we will not be coming back. I brought this to the managers attention. There response was that they are trying to take care of it. Not good. Also the bathroom didn't have hot water at all after running for two minutes. This is not a very good sign just saying after being a local for 36 year's."}
{"text":"I came here after having a bad experience the first time. I decided to give them another chance, and the 2nd time around was a lot better! I ordered their fried chicken sandwich, and it was very good. They homemake the bread, and that makes the sandwich so much better than just a standard bun. The service was good too. I'll probably be returning in the future with hopes that the service stays good and doesn't go back to how it was the first time I came."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Also had the garlic knots which were also good. Beer was cold. Service was good. I can't speak about the prices because my sister's new boyfriend picked up the tab...Score!!!"}
{"text":"Hawthorne's has several spots in the Queen City--but on my first visit to the Ballantyne location I was greeting with superb customer service, with the GM even sitting in my booth and asking if we were enjoying everything. I am a sucker for great customer service. Regarding the food, I sampled a few items from chili to sandwiches to pizza and everything was pretty good. Ironically one of my favorite dishes was a non pizza item..it was an italian sandwich. I think the patio is ripe for spring/summer nights and the bar (of which I indulged in a Tito's vodka lemonade) is great for game watching (if you're into that kind of thing) and tasty drinks."}
{"text":"My mom and I ate at Hawthornes for lunch today.  WOW!  She had the turkey club with side salad and commented it was the best she'd ever eaten.  I had the marinated chicken breast sandwich with side salad.  Unbelievable flavor for a salad, so crisp and delicious.  Bread seemed to be homemade - absolutely out of this world.  We got the beer battered onions rings as an appetizer. As a native Charlottean, I didn't think it was possible for anyone to beat South 21 onion rings. Hawthornes may have done it!  Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't comment on the incredible staff.  EVERYONE was so nice and pleasant.  Rare to find in today's world."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about and very pricy for what you get.  Food is certainly not bad.  I still go once in a blue moon."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere! They are very friendly here and the food I amazing. Customer service is excellent. And yes! Those garlic knots are where it's at!! Definitely recommend this for a great meal with any friend!"}
{"text":"I waited an hour beyond the \"pick up\" time.  The manager then gave me a coupon to save $5 off my next $20 purchase....really?  (She turned to the cashier and asked him if there were \"any other customers I need to diffuse?\"  I was shocked since I hadn't complained.   When I finally got home with my pizzas, I learned they were made wrong.  Major fail!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great. Service is always really good. It's incredible family friendly (kids can walk up to watch pizzas being made and get a ball of pizza dough to play with). Veggie pizza actually has real vegetables on it and there are always good beer specials. Garlic knots are fantastic too."}
{"text":"Food is great, but the bartender was a moron. I paid my 25 dollar tab with a 20 dollar gift card and a 20 dollar bill, and he kept my cash and gave me the 15 dollar remainder on a the gift card. When I asked him why he did that, he said it was too late to fix the transaction. Dumb."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and great service. The environment is very welcoming and friendly, and their food is just outstanding. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for an outstanding meal at an affordable cost."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!!  Crappy dough pizza is subpar calzone was no good. Decent beers but expensive...  Go somewhere else :("}
{"text":"Philly cheesesteak is great. Simple but delicious and the staff is incredibility polite. Normally I would say this if it was just me and my wife eating out, but this review is with a group of eight. Normally when I eat with large groups the food is extremely hit or miss.   Cooks don't know how to time food to come out properly and wait staff doesn't remember everything. Not this time! Everyone really loved their meals and nothing was wrong."}
{"text":"Great drinks and great food.  Tuesday is trivia and if you come for lunch you can usually make it back to work within an hour if your drive is less than 15 min"}
{"text":"Great slice of the day lunch with a good fresh salad. Tried the balsamic blue cheese dressing on the salad, & it was very tasty. Great service by Lisa. First time here, & I'll come back if I get back this way."}
{"text":"The Greek pizza is to die for! SO, good.   Parking is a bit of an issue,but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but for the SECOND time they ran out of beer. The manager on Duty, JT was very unsympathetic not apologetic at all. He didn't even offer a solution. Will NOT come back for a celebration EVER again.  Party of 6 tonight party of 10 last time. HEADING TO THE HILL!!!"}
{"text":"I had a decent lunch here today, but it's the kind of place I'll go to again only if someone is really insistent or we happen to be right in the area. The service was a little less than decent. Our server disappeared for great lengths of time, and somehow we managed to run out of drinks ever time. We had french fries, but there was no ketchup on the table. We waited nearly 10 minutes for the server to stop by and check on the food that someone else had dropped off, and only then could we get the ketchup we needed. The sandwich was good, but the pizza we ordered was fantastically greasy. It was an orange gloss on the top of the slice that dripped off into a thick pool all over the plate when the slice was picked up. Everyone was friendly, but as slow as the restaurant was it seemed like we spent a lot of time waiting for assistance. Finally, and an issue that probably doesn't bother everyone, there are also some decor issues. There are patches all over the place, which results in yellow walls with white spots everywhere. If it was just a couple spots, it wouldn't be a thing, but with so many patches in so many places, it just makes you wonder when the work is going to get started. The red walls aren't patched, so I'm guessing those aren't going to be resolved. Not a huge deal, but I don't want to sit at lunch and look at a messy wall."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  Food is okay.  It is close to NY Style, but is not dead on.  No where is.  The crowd is the ambience in here.  Service is subpar in my opinion.  You get the sense that you have to be a regular regular to get proper service.  I will still visit it, hoping to one day be in the \"in-crowd\""}
{"text":"In my opinion, the pizza at Hawthorne's isn't anything special. I usually order green pepper and mushroom, and it's just...ok. The green peppers are chopped up pretty small and usually in a single pile in the middle, so if I want toppings in each bite I have to manually spread them out.   However - the garlic knots here are TO DIE FOR. They are huge, and come out piping hot, drenched in olive oil and garlic, and baked just right - a tiny bit crisp in the outer crust and very soft inside."}
{"text":"Solid little restaurant in Mint Hill. Nice outdoor seating and a spacious interior dining room. Fare is pizza, pasta, salads and sandwiches. Good prices and good food. They also have wifi and a full bar."}
{"text":"Good place and friendly service. Carter was great. Management and Carter checked in with everyone all the time. Wait was long because they drop a pizza and remade it. However coming and explaining it gave it a personal touch."}
{"text":"Great Stromboli (Buffalo Stromboli) and nice beer selection.    I enjoy going there."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed in the lack of attention from the staff and mistakes on orders. I also don't see how this place can justify a lunch for three people at the rate of nearly $70. I will not be a frequent flyer here."}
{"text":"Good pizza and great for families! ! im pretty picky with pizza and will say when its hot and fresh out of the oven its good stuff. My favorite dish is the muscles appetizer....and the warm spinach salad too"}
{"text":"Had a disappointing Sunday dinner at Hawthorne's Mint Hill.  We started with an order of calamari to share.  Tasted fresh but was a very small portion, certainly not worth $10.  We ordered eggplant parm which was very good.  The other order was shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta.  A very small portion of pasta.  Was the amount of a side dish.  What at first looked like a good serving of shrimp was found to be each shrimp cut up into pieces.  There was maybe 3 medium shrimp, not a good value for $14.  Giving a 3rd star because the service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Friend I ate here to grab a bite to eat before going to get drinks.  We went around 7:30 on Tuesday and had no problem getting seated. I've always wanted to eat here, for I've herd great things about this place for years. I had the Italian sausage & pepperoni Stromboli & my friend had a 9' Greek pizza. The wait for our food wasn't long and it tasted absolutely delicious ! We were satisfied & full & both were pretty okay with the bill. I definitely will be coming back, specifically to get some pizza."}
{"text":"The food is good and is kid friendly. Parking is a bit of a pain as there are only a few spots in the front. Service could have been a bit better as I never received a refill of my drink til I asked for a to go cup. Good pizza though."}
{"text":"Good pizza, I also like that they use the \"level up\" app. I saved $10 on my order."}
{"text":"Wow...we haven't been back in a while and let me say that this place has gone down hill.... First the manager rolled our sever under the bus when our app took so long to come out. That blew us away, why would you blame the server who works for tips and now her table thinks she screwed up. Well that for sure would affect her tips... Next a restaurant that does not have sweet tea in the south? What restaurant does not have sweet tea? I guess since the change in management is really affecting this location. I asked for garlic powder and they brought a salt shaker the was not even half full, turns out that was all the garlic powder they had in the whole restaurant!!! Wow that's poor management.They charge for specialty pizza and it is so thin that you can't get it off the pan they serve it on without it falling apart. I guess if they are going to survive they need to change there management staff and turn this place around. Not sure we will be back and those of you who do go be very cautious......  You have been warned....!!!!"}
{"text":"This place really frustrates me. The food is pretty good and they have a full bar, but the service is erratic, and the noise level is just plain unacceptable. Why are there always screaming children running wild in this place? I guess parents think a restaurant that serves pizza is automatically geared for kids. Can't blame the place for that, but all the hard surfaces only amplify the din...and then there are all those TVs, at least 3, which is a lot for a pretty small place. Even my friend who is an elementary school teacher couldn't handle the noise!"}
{"text":"We eat at Hawthorne's every weekend and have never had a bad meal.  Lindsey is usually our waitress and does a fantastic job!  It would be nice if they would get Birdsong Jalapeno Pale Ale though, then it'd be perfect!"}
{"text":"Pretty good wings. I'm sure they'd be better after smoking some chronic. I fux witcha!!"}
{"text":"Meh, is the best way to describe it. Just moved into the area and I ordered two large pizzas and it was almost thirty dollars! I don't mind paying that for two pizzas but they honestly were not that good. I am not picky about pizza by any means but ill have to differ in this case. The atmosphere of the place is actually quite enjoyable and have not had the privilege of getting a few beers there."}
{"text":"We ate here last Saturday. It was a great time. The server was friendly, excited about his job and the restaurant. We ordered a large pepperoni and the sausage meatball onion mushroom pizza. It was great. Not the best pizza in town but good. The garlic knots was the winner at our table. They were huge and covered in garlic. Definitely the small order was plenty. The best part was Magic Barry. He is there ever Saturday night. At first we felt bad that we had no money to tip him but he graciously told us not to worry. That the restaurant pays him to be there every Saturday night. The kids loved him and he spent so much time doing magic tricks at our table. It was awesome. The girls can't wait to go back just for him... :-)"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for the warmer weather.  I drive by this location so much, yet never stopped in.  On a Sunday, my friends and I were in the Plaza Midwood area and wanted pizza.  A friend recommended a place with a patio, and I thought to check this place.    We had the mussels and garlic bread, which was excellent.  Mussels were clean and all opened!  It is my pet peeve when I get unopened mussels.  We had their Tuscan salad, which was perfect especially with our wine.  There was some homemade croutons in the salad, which were my favorite.  The pizza was hands-down one of the best in Charlotte.  Thin and crispy with an excellent base.  The slices on the large pie were truly that of a large pie.  We did a classic cheese with meatballs (SLICED heavenly meatballs, not that crumbly stuff) and a spinach pizza with just the right amount of garlic.  Waitstaff was friendly and warm.  It was causal, but upbeat.  Saw many having a good time at work, while really making sure all their tables were happy.   I can't wait to come back.  I saw some garlic knots go out, and from the looks of it, probably a good snack."}
{"text":"Really wanted to give no stars but not possible.    We have been enjoying Hawthorne's Mint Hill for years.  Yes it has it's ups and downs but tonight was a huge down and a deal breaker.  We \"talked\" two other couples to join us there tonight and it was an experience from hell.   We were the last couple to arrive and after 15 minutes we were curtly asked for our drink preference.     She returned and asked if we would. Ike an appetizer.  no thank you we will wait for our drink orders and with that she went off to say that she had customers on the other side of the restaurant plus outside etc. etc. with a major attitude.   Asked what my problem was and I then said please manager or another waitress.  We are all senior citizens and this has never happened before .    All 6 at the table said they would never return.    A mgr never came to the table but Kayla was replaced with a very attentive and nice waitress. The restaurant was not busy........we left at 8:00 and probably 6 people in the restaurant...I guess that speaks volumes."}
{"text":"The NY style pizza is always good. However, I would add less oil and make the bread a bit thinner. Overall not bad, needs improvement, but the best NY style pizza in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is an \"all around great restaurant\". My favorite item on the menu is the lasagna. The staff and managers always seem eager to please. They even give discounts for active and retired military which I thought was great. Very clean and the patio area is an added plus to enjoy especially this time of year. If you have dogs your welcome on the patio our waitress even brought water for our dog when she brought the drinks to the table. If you want great friendly service ask for Nicki."}
{"text":"Pretty good, my husband got a huge pizza and delicious. I had a 10\" gluten free, the crust was a very thin almost cracker like. Not my preference but it was fresh and tasted good enough. No reaction from cross contamination which is always a huge plus!"}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened to this place. Teenage server who doesn't give a single care, rarely shows up, didn't bring silverware but puts salad in front of you like you can do something with it, 15 minutes for drink to show up, grilled bacon cheese sandwich was bland but decent... at least the fries were good and warm. Place wasn't even remotely busy. Just felt like amateur night for a restaurant. Sad thing is this was the first time back in at least a couple years of which I never went back before this because of the same reasons. Le sigh"}
{"text":"Finally tried Hawthorne's last week after waiting a couple of years post-Mellow Mushroom.  Yawn -- really nondescript taste (though a couple of the topping combinations were quite interesting -- including pulled pork on their take on the Hawaiian pizza -- nicely done!).  No reason to pick this place when Brooklyn's is just over at Rea and Colony."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great selection of beer and great service by Kayla; she's the best server in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Good food -- lousy customer service.  You can find good pizza elsewhere without the headache."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte. The reasons: 1. Generous toppings 2. Flavorful, robust sauce. 3. Gooey, delicious cheese. 4. Creative menu. 5. Fantastic specials.  6. Terrific service. 7. Awesome locations. 8. Good beer & specials.  9. An A+ to-go system. 10. Consistent excellence."}
{"text":"We got take out tonight so I can't comment on the experience in the restaurant but the staff that handles the take out were very friendly and quick.  Got the Elizabeth pizza and it was great.  Great soft, doughy crust.  Just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I go there. The veal parm dish is very good at a reasonable price. Their pizza is great but it always tastes better when you eat it there. Good beer selection and a good place to sit outside and enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"Pizza is good. The pasta is fair. My husband and I eat here once a month. It's a bit pricey.  He gets the \"angel hair\" pasta but it definitely looks more like spaghetti noodles. Pasta isn't anything special. I like the BBQ chicken pizza or sandwiches. Service is decent"}
{"text":"Perhaps being an out-of-towner has something to do with my review, but I have to say this wasn't the greatest pizza. I'm from Atlanta and was looking for a good, solid pizza. We were led to believe this place was the \"best pizza in Charlotte\". If it is truly the best pizza in Charlotte, then maybe Charlotte just isn't a great city for pizza. The crust wasn't anything special (and kinda hard...), the toppings were sparse, the sauce was \"meh\". One thing I did appreciate was the mid day specials. You can't beat $2.50 for a pint and $12 for an entire pizza."}
{"text":"I don't know who told them that was New York style pizza. Chewy crust, not an enjoyable Pizza at all."}
{"text":"Hawthorne's has the best pizza in Charlotte. The quality of ingredients is great and you don't feel sick after stuffing your face with this pizza. I have tried just about every pizza place there is to try in Charlotte and this is the ONLY place worth eating!  The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is that I only recommend it for take out. The pizza tastes better in take out than when you eat in. The atmosphere and the service inside the restaurant leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"I went to Hawthorne's for lunch with coworkers for a birthday celebration. The restaurant is tidy and well-kept. They offer a full bar and televisions for sports entertainment. The service was good and the food was tasty. I typically do not frequent pizza spots, but this one is suitable for a casual social gathering/outing."}
{"text":"I went in late last night, around 10:30pm on a search for my style pizza. I am happy to say I was not disappointed with my choice. Large pepperoni pizza, garlic knots, mozzarella sticks, and tiramisu. Everything was hot and fresh and really good. Except the tiramisu, it was out of this world ! It was absolutely the best I have ever had. Ever. I will be returning. Garlic knots swimming in butter and chunks of garlic, great pizza prices and heavenly tiramisu; so happy to have found you Hawthornes!"}
{"text":"Ordered here twice.   First time I ordered a pizza since I heard people rave about the pizza and have being brought up in NY for 20 years, decided to give it a try. Unfortunately I used the postmates service to deliver my pizza, was not so good, AT ALL. Was highly disappointed. Will try again, though.   I ordered the fried cheesecake and the plate of cannolis tonight and the fried cheese cake is to DIE FOR! Cannolis are DEF worth a try as well!"}
{"text":"Hawthorne's is great! I would definitely recommend dining in instead of takeout because their food is really only good when you eat in. I have tried a lot of their specialty pizzas and basically everyone of them is good, I really like the pesto pizza. They also have great salads, appetizers, and sandwiches. The atmosphere is cool and the service is also great. It's also a really good place for groups of people!"}
{"text":"Having lived in NYC for 6 years, I am skeptical of any place claiming to have a \"NY Pizza\". I don't normally write scathing reviews, and I'll keep this short. The bartender was rude and dismissive, the bourbon was overpriced, the pizza tasted o.k., but made me sick the next day."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to going here as it was a bit closer to our house but was completely let down. Sorry to say that we wasn't impressed at all with our visit. The beer selection was very lacking as in they pretty much didn't have many locals to choose from. Service was o.k. but our waitress seemed to be more inclined to here boyfriend which was sitting right behind us. Lots of giggles and over reacting to whatever he was doing in his booth. She was also kinda pushy with taking our order. We'll just strike it up to just being very young.  We ordered the Caribbean Chicken Wings for the appetizer and have to say that if I didn't know any better I would swear that was the same sauce that goes on Sesame Chicken at a Chinese Restaurant. I even made the statement to our waitress that if they added some hot peppers to the sauce that they could call it General Tso's Chicken Wings. The wings themselves were over cooked. I assume that they pre-cook them and then throw them back into the oil when an order comes in. I could be wrong but it would explain why they were over cooked and dry inside. Kinda like chewing leather. We also ordered the Vegi-Sicilian Pizza and added white onions and kalamata olives. The toppings were great though lacking in the sauce department. Could have used a bit more sauce. The crust was horrific. Dry to the bone. Was like eating toast. each bite would turn to powder in your mouth. What a shame too. We will go back to Hawthorns Pizza but we will have to stick with the one on 7th street in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Went in on Saturday night with friends. Service was fast and friendly.  Tried their version of bang bang shrimp and it was delish. A bit more spicy than the other places but nice size serving. Plenty for the three of us.  Wings are always good. Keep wanting to go back on Sunday night for half price bottles of wine.  Great place to visit with friends over good food and drink"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service! Waited 15 min for my soda. Not busy! I l left! No one bother to ask if I needed anything"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a second chance. The first time around, I was charged close to $9 for a buffalo chicken salad that had a few SMALL pcs of chicken and a bunch of lettuce. This time, I ordered penne vodka, almost $11. when I get home and open up the foil container, I could SEE the bottom of the container! It was about two small cups worth of pasta. This is unconscionable. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times to grab a quick bite and a few beers. Never disappointed! cant say ive had there pizza so ill review that at another time. love the chicken club! service is always good.  Saw a couple gentlemen next to me get wings and they looked delicious! Try the chilli cheese dip its good (the chips are thick not the cheap greasy thin crap)"}
{"text":"This is my local watering hole where I venture several times a week.   Good place to meet up for drinks after work or unwind during the weekend.  The Pizza is some of best in town & the pasta and sandwiches are solid also.  Staff is friendly and I've not had any issue with service.  During dinner times (6:30-8) when I see typically wait but seating is not bad anytime before or after.    This is not a sports bar its a family restaurant that as TVs that play sports on limited number of channels (not in HD either (one of my only gripes of the place).  If you want pizza this is place to visit or have beer on patio during nice weather."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken Caesar salad. The LUNCH portion cost me $12.89. I could've gotten a bigger and better salad at Chick Fil A! it brought 4 pieces of chicken strips a ton of lettuce abd a few croutons. Very disappointed! EXTREMELY OVER PRICED! NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"We had pizza here for the first time and the food was delicious! The GM was there and came by our table several times just striking up conversation about the game on TV. He knows exactly how to be a customer focused manager. The BBQ chicken pizza was so, so good."}
{"text":"Perfect ..... again.  Consistency counts and this place has it.  Love."}
{"text":"Came to spot for the first time with my wife, love the atmosphere and the customer service. Would highly recommend this for anyone from single to and entire group. A must place to try."}
{"text":"Hawthorne's a great little pizza place in Elizabeth.  It's a good place to stop for lunch since you can get options by the slice.  There's a pretty affordable slice/salad/drink combo.  They have standard pizza topping options and a few adventurous choices as well.  I really liked the Luau  - which included pulled pork and pineapple!  Additionally they have a homemade ranch dressing that is pretty tasty.  There is a nice outdoor patio along with an indoor seating area and a bar area.  I'll definitely be back to enjoy Hawthorne's!"}
{"text":"Love having Hawthorne's in the area! There aren't too many places to get a good beer around here, and the bar is great. They've turned into my go-to pickup place. I've had so many problems ordering pizza from Pizza Hut and Dominoes around here that it's been great to order on their app and pickup in 15 minutes. The pizza is obviously far, far superior as well."}
{"text":"Visiting the area and found this place through Yelp. It was delicious! We would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Love this Hawthorne's! We live across the street and eat here often. We've tried pizza, calzones, pasta, sandwiches - all awesome! Love their new menu, and the service is great."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and I have no complaints about the service or food. Well, I take that back. Tonight we ordered garlic knots as an appetizer and there was so much garlic on them, I first thought they were a plate of biscuits and gravy. We didn't want to bother our server, so we just scraped it off, but I was surprised the kitchen even sent them out to us like that! Now, don't get me wrong, the knots themselves were great. The bread was wonderfully baked, just way, way, WAY too much garlic (even for garlic lovers like us). Our entrees, however, were perfect! Our waiter, a tall African American guy with glasses, was top notch! If you get him when you come here, you definitely won't he disappointed! I like this restaurant overall, just wish they'd chill on the garlic!"}
{"text":"They forgot my ordered. And I had to wait another 30 minutes. They didn't say anything to me"}
{"text":"I have had their calzones before and thought they were good but we decided to try the pizza tonight.. A large pizza with pep, sausage, onions, mushrooms was $18. The pizza was fair - lots of grease and the crust was too chewy for me!"}
{"text":"Service was great...food priced good for portions. Bartender, got it!!"}
{"text":"It would literally be impossible for a restaurant to screw up a to go order more often than this Hawthornes location. I live within walking distance, so my friends nad I order (or make that used to order) Hawthornes all the time.   I'm not kidding around when I say THEY SCREWED UP 5 OUT OF 5 OF MY LAST ORDERS!!!!!!  Perhaps it makes me an idiot for keep going back, but the staff is nice, so I tend to give them the benefit of the doubt, but that ship has sailed. Last order there was a piece of paper in my cannoli. Time before that I asked for the pasta sauce on the side, they left it out completely. Order before that they didn't give me ranch or blue cheese for my wings even though I said it on the phone, and then asked AGAIN  when I picked it up if it was in the bag. Time before that ordered a salad for my boss at work along with some other stuff and there was no dressing. (It's too far to drive back, so I had to go back out and get her fast food.)  The other day I was there they of course left something out, so I walked back. The manager knows they screw up my orders a lot, just because I'm constantly having to come back and complain something is wrong. So she offers me $10 off my next order.... She said to just come back and say the female manager told me to take $10 off my order. So I did, AND THE PERSON ON THE PHONE REFUSED TO GIVE ME THE DISCOUNT!   I don't care if this place was so close it was in the kitchen of my house, I'm never ever ever eating at this craphole again.    Seriously this place is the single worst restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life in regards to getting your order right. It is seriously mind blowing how bad they are. AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great wait staff. The pizza is delicious. Conveniently located. Wide variety of beverages. Awesome that they give teachers a discount."}
{"text":"Very mixed feelings about this place. The only saving grace and the reason I will possibly go back is that the pizza tasted great. And the tiramisu was good and a decent portion.   Bad points: Overpriced. Me and my husband and toddler spent $70 (that includes a 20% tip) for dinner and that is just with soft drinks (we don't drink alcohol).   Kids mac and cheese: for $7 I was expecting some really good mac and cheese (menu said it was home made). It was literally undercooked penne noodles with velveeta sauce on top (velveeta actually tastes better). I had to cut up each individual noodle (maybe they were out of the ones they normally use) to feed it to my toddler. She ate it because she eats anything but it didn't taste very good and wasn't worth the price.   Don't get your dessert \"to go\": my husbands brownie was so tiny that we thought it was a joke. Perhaps the portion is larger if you eat it there? And the ice cream included with it literally came in a tiny to-go butter container. The amount of ice cream wouldn't even cover a teaspoon. I avoided seeing what they charged for it to not get angry.   Strange refill procedure: I was out of lemonade so the server dumped lemonade from another cup (not a pitcher or fresh cup) into mine which filled it like hallway.... very strange. Was it from a cup of a customer who didn't finish theirs? And why did I only get half of a refill? Very sketchy.  All in all, the pizza was good but way too many complaints to justify spending $70.  Maybe you pay for the atmosphere and beer and drink selection, but if you aren't into that then I say go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a beer and share a pizza.  The service is friendly, and there's a good selection of draft beers.    This is more of a family place than a bar, and there are usually a ton of kids running around.  There's a good patio area to hang out in, which is great in the summer.    The antipasta salad is great!"}
{"text":"Love their special white pizza. Always have had a great experience, can get a bit loud as the dining room echoes."}
{"text":"With all the other good pizza places nearby, I think I'll pass on Hawthorne's in the future.  The service was weird and we weren't overly impressed.  The anti-pasta salad was good for a starter.  I got a calzone for my meal and it was so flavorless.  I guess I should have added a topping or two to have some taste, but I am used to plain calzones being delicious.  It was a total waste of calories.  The people I went with got a specialty pizza that they weren't so thrilled about either."}
{"text":"The food here is always delicious(my favorite is the elizabeth pizza), but besides having good food, the staff here is awesome! After picking up a to go order, my car decided to not start. The manager was so friendly and helpful! After helping me jump my car, I was able to go home and eat my delicious pizza. Between the food and hospitality,  it cant be beat!"}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to the Elizabeth neighborhood of Charlotte and to Hawthorne's New York Pizza and Bar.   Elizabeth is named after Anne Elizabeth Watts, the only Charlotte neighborhood named for a woman. You can read more about the history here.   Dora here. Don't let this picture deceive you. We arrived right at eleven, and by the time we left, both inside and out was jammed. Hawthorne's appears to be a popular place for locals as many people walked here.  The garlic cheese bread appetizer was cheesy with just the right amount of garlic. It came out fast, the cheese bubbling and gooey, and browned to perfection.   Dora here. This cheesy bread reminded me of our favorite pizza place in Florida. We always divided it up into equal portions because our son ravaged it. Same thing happened this time, but with our grandson. A sure sign that it was a winner. :)  We wanted to pace ourselves, so we ordered the 9\" Meat Eaters pizza, and we were glad we did.  This pizza was loaded with meat (pepperoni, Italian sausage, beef, ham, bacon) and mozzarella. In each bite, I tasted all of the different meat flavors, and they all worked together. One thing we noticed, unlike other meat pies which tend to be greasy and heavy, this pizza was light with no greasy aftereffects.   Dora here. I really wanted to order the Sicilian, but that only comes in GIANT size, so since we were ordering cheesy bread and dessert, I compromised on this. Not my favorite pizza, but it was good. I appreciated that it wasn't heavy on the sauce or spice.   Check out the Cannoli Plate, three mini cannolis.   Dora here. We first sampled cannolis in Sicily, and loved them! Since then, we've tried the US versions, and none of them have come close to what we experienced overseas. Not that we're food snobs, but buttercream filling..really? Yuck! Hawthorne's cannolis tasted like the real deal, ricotta and cream cheese goodness in a fried pastry! Three minis were just the right size to cap off our meal. Well, Little Man didn't think so. :)   We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.  What's your favorite pizza hangout?

{"text":"It isn't truly NY style pizza, but it's decent. I've tried the Gorgonzola Salad and enjoyed it. Nice patio, yet parking is limited. For me, it's a lunch special kind of place or place to unwind with friends.  There's better pizza around."}
{"text":"Not truly NY-style, but okay in a hurry and has ample parking."}
{"text":"I have been eating in and ordering out from Hawthornes for years.... but I think it's time to find another 'favorite pizza' place.  Both the quality and the amount of ingredients have literally been getting smaller and smaller ..... ordered my usual pizza a few days ago and when I got it home.... there was hardly any cheese on it... it wasn't as 'juicey' as normal and the ingredients stopped about an inch and a half from the rim. If i wanted bread, I would have ordered bread ... I think the problem lies with each pizza maker.... the last 2 of 3 times the pizza was sub par..the taste was just not there like usual...... I am really disappointed."}
{"text":"Favorite place in the Elizabeth area! Everything is so good! Try the queso dip or fried jalapenos for starters."}
{"text":"I always order a plain pie - its the best way to gauge how good a pizza place really is. All the flavors were there, so close to tri-state quality. But the one aspect many of the parlors down here seem to fall short on is the lack of sauce.  However, this was definitely very good and I will return for more. Hoping they take my advice and add an extra cup or so of sauce to the recipe."}
{"text":"First time we ate here in the fall of 2010 we weren't blown away by the pizza. We have since been back a number of times and it has been much better and we now look forward to eating here. Easy place to bring kids. We have 4 kids and our server was great with them. Their salads are really good. Fried calamari is okay. They started slow for us but we are now fans."}
{"text":"There isn't a ton to eat in this area, so I go here A LOT. The servers are great, but the people who work take out are FANTASTIC. I've never had a bad experience and they are always smiling and so helpful. Love this place."}
{"text":"Hawthorne's Huntersville. Food poisoning... cramps, vomiting and more. I should have realized when I got sick the first time... the menu is in the trash. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pizza in town! The Crew is the pizza that I almost always get. Fantastic! Great location in the Elizabeth Neighborhood area. Nice outdoor seating and the part of the front-end of the restaurant opens up when the weather is nice. My kids love the pizza there as well. They can even go up and watch the pizza being made. The pizza guy always gives them a ball of dough to play with too! That is their favorite thing and it keeps them occupied too. Great bar area to hang out with friends. Really good place to meet with a group of people. Service is usually good and friendly with attentiveness issues every now and then when it's busy. Very small front parking lot, so parking can be a pain at times. Gotta try The Crew!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate here today.  We ordered a large pepperoni and cheese pizza.  I was excited because I have driven by this place many times and it looks cool from the front.  When we received our pizza it was extremely greasy.  I did not want to say anything though because I didn't want my fiancé to not eat it.  So I toughed out the first slice.  Before I was about to eat my next slice she said \"we need more napkins, this pizza is extremely greasy\".  I agreed so I went to the front and got more napkins.  On the way back to my table I glanced at another pizza with pepperoni on it at the table beside us and noticed it wasn't as greasy.  When I got back to our table my fiancé dabbed about 5 napkins full of grease.  Then I looked at my plate and it was covered in grease.  I came clean, I told my fiancé that this pizza is way too greasy.  I said I checked the table behind me, they have a similar order and their pizza is no were near as greasy as ours.  I worked at Speedy's Pizza in Sylva NC for three years and never once saw a pizza made that greasy.  I told her we have to say something.  So we flagged our waitress down and told her and she got the manager.  When the manager came to the table, where there were noticeably 5 disgusting napkins and grease everywhere, and asked us what the problem was?  We said look at our pizza, it is covered in grease.  She said; \"obviously you have not tried our pepperonis\".  And my fiancé said \"look, I have never seen a pizza this greasy in my life\".  I decided to cut in because I felt the conversation was getting ridiculous.  I just asked that she comp our pizza and we will pay for all the other items we ordered.  The manager became emotional and took offense to this.  She kept asking if she could make us a cheese pizza.  I didn't want to go through all of that I wanted to leave by now and she said; \"never have I had a customer not let me make it right\".  But she said it really loud and it embarrassed the hell out of us. To make matters worse, in the back this waitress made 2 comments.  The first one was, \"I ate that pizza they sent back and it was amazing!!\"  The second was \"I'm going to send back 3 perfectly good 18 inch pizzas today from pain in the ass customers just to see what happens\"  Me and my fiancé were embarrassed.  Look, I worked in that industry.  I know it's a hard job.  I always said once I get out of the industry I will look back on my experience there and tip well and be polite to cooks and waitstaff.  I always do that.  However, I am not going to get diarrhea and be sick all night and pay 16 some odd dollars for a pizza to appease these people.  The pizza was not edible.  The manager did comp us our entire meal and gave us a free cheese pizza.  In all honesty, it was a back handed deal.  She was upset with us, they were talking about us noticeably loud in the back and she wanted to make a point.  Look, we didn't like the greasy pizza OK?  No love lost, we don't want any problems.  We did accept the pizza which is probably covered in spit.  I just wanted to say, upon further review, this cheese pizza taste like computer paper.  So there, I still don't like it.  Don't eat here."}
{"text":"The pizza is good and reasonably priced but everything else is over priced and just so so.  Had the spinach salad last night and added blackened shrimp and the cost was $16.  Way over priced , small portion and not good at all!!  Most of the spinach was wilted and the shrimp were mushy and not fresh tasting at all.    The server noticed that I had eaten very little and asked if it was ok and when I said no and it was wilted she only said it was because of the dressing but made no offer to correct the situation.   I definitely will not be returning.  It's ok to mess up a dish but do something to make it right!!    Thank you for responding to my review on Yelp.  We were there on Saturday evening, June 17th between 7:00 and 8:00 PM.   The server was good so I was very surprised at her at her lack of concern over the fact we barely touched the salad and seemed to only make an excuse for the quality. Regardless of the quality of the salad, I do think it is extremely overpriced for what was actually served.  Thank you for following up, I did try to email you at letusknow@hawthornes.com but it was returned as undeliverable."}
{"text":"AlwYs a good family dinner option. We live nearby and enjoy this place. Fabulous pizzas, really tasty with toppings cut perfectly and they are huge slices!!"}
{"text":"I just had food delivered via postmates. I was pretty excited because I had been craving blackened chicken Alfredo. I was quite sad when I opened the container and saw chicken that didn't look blackened, just looked as it had been cooked on a dirty grill. I threw the chicken away and gave the pasta a try. I was expecting Alfredo sauce, but's it's more of a carbonara sauce. There's either pieces of ham or bacon in it, which I wasn't expecting. On top of that, it's watered down. Almost as if the noodles weren't drained after boiling just pulled out and throw in. I've eaten here many times and never had an issue. Hopefully, next time, it will be better"}
{"text":"I live down the street and visit this location often for takeout and sometimes to eat in.  Great patio and bar area.  The pizza is always solid.  I normally order the Elizabeth Special pizza.  For salads the chopped is great if you like green olives.  I prefer the Hawthorne salad with those awesome and sweet pecans.  A great pizza join that I am happy to have in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I AM A HUGE FAN OF THIS PLACE,,,,,, I found this place about 4 years ago while driving around after class and boy o' boy am i glad i did. Please don't let the name fool you they do have more than pizza and bar food, I got there often and i love the garlic knots with the chopped garlic pieces, I like to dip that in any pasta i get. Yummm........ Some times on Friday they have specials with are very budge friendly and so are the drinks. Its a cool place to go when you're out with the girls or they guys.... so check them out"}
{"text":"I've been around the Charlotte pizza scene now and I have decided Hawthorne's is my favorite pizza in Charlotte.  I haven't had enough true NY pizza to compare this, but I can say NY or not, it is good.    The best part is the outside patio right on the main strip in Elizabeth with plenty of opportunities for people watching.    I need to venture off the pizza menu as they have a full pasta menu, but the pizza is just so good that I seem to have to order it every time I'm here."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience.  Restaurant was empty and yet we waited forever for pizzas that were brought out luke warm.  Had to wait for new pizzas that were only slightly hotter and no adjustment was made to the check.  We won't be back and it's a shame because we've always liked this place."}
{"text":"Currently the roads in front are under construction. This makes it a challenge to get here. You almost have to have your heart set on it Italian to make the effort. If you cross on to 8th st from 7th   Penne Alfredo (side portion) big enough for 1- Excellent!!!! I've had better but was happy with it.  Penne ala Vodka minus the pruchetta + shrimp - My friend loved it!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today and was impressed. I didn't have the pizza but had one of the best wraps I have ever eaten. It was the veggie wrap with fried eggplant, mushrooms, tomato, cheese, and horseradish mayo. It was the lunch special and came with a side salad tossed in balsamic vinaigrette. The dressing was way too oily for my taste so I wouldn't recommend that. The portion was very large for lunch and brought the other half of the wrap home for dinner. Service was fine. Maybe next time I'll try the pizza but it will be hard to order that over the delicious wrap!"}
{"text":"Service was good.  Atmosphere is perfectly casual.  My husband said his sandwich and fries were great.  But my pizza was not good at all. I was starving, and I didn't even eat half.  The crust was hard and dense with no flavor.  There was too much cheese, even with the request for light cheese.  For a place with pizza in the name, I expected better.  I'd love to see them revamp their pizza dough.  Until then, I can't waste time or calories here."}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian food with fast friendly service! I enjoy their meat ravioli , which has flavors of basil and oregano with a savory marinara sauce. The salads are delicious too and their garlic knots are out of this world carbolicious goodness! The chicken marsala is tasty too. They have good beer specials and i tried the founders pumpkin spice beer that is amazing in October!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Moved from NJ so high expectations for Italian and was not disappointed!  Pizzas pastas entrees and salads are all good.  The only negative is parking (especially for take out) but won't dock a star because there's not much you can do about that."}
{"text":"We returned to Hawthorne's on a Sunday night and sat at a hightop near the bar area.  Instead of their delicious pizza, we decided to try their pastas for a change.   I went with the Gorgonzola Pasta with Sausage.  All I can say is:  WOW.  The pasta was so rich, creamy, and gorgonzola-y, it was simply amazing.  I literally could not get enough of it and could not stop eating it, despite feeling full after about 2/3 of it.  I had to finish it, savoring every bite.  The salty sausage was a great balance to the rich, cheesy taste of the sauce.  (My mouth is watering now just writing about it.)  So, the next time we go to Hawthorne's, I'm going to have the dilemma of choosing between this fantastic pasta dish again or go with one of their top-notch NY Style pizzas.   Note:  we were surprised at how many kids were in the restaurant for a Sunday night and asked our server if it was because of a \"kids eat free\" thing.  He said no, that it's always like that on the weekends.  Interesting."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of all the locally owned Hawthorne's around charlotte and this one is just as good as all the rest. The pizza and wings are delicious and the service is always fast and friendly.   The only downside I would have to remark on this particular location has to do with the bar area. It' has concrete floors and floor to ceiling windows so it can get exceptionally noisy in there on game days and especially if you have some over zealous sports fans parked at the bar.   The noise level at the bar aside, if you are in the mood for some great pizza and/or wings check it out for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and this is a pretty solid place to go for pizza and pasta. I wouldn't say it's \"super great awesome\" but definitely good. The beers are moderately priced as well as the food but the service has always been top notch. I've had their pizza which is delicious, pasta (also very good) but I'd say their best food is probably their chicken wings. I haven't sampled the flavors just yet because I seem to be stuck on the Bold'n Tangy ones but its never does me wrong. Also, the chili queso dip is quite a treat as well but if you order it for a app just be careful not to fill up on it because it can almost be a meal for two by itself."}
{"text":"OK, we have huge portions and a great atmosphere to just hang out with friends and family, which are key ingredients for a great night out.  I really enjoy their Sicilian pizza and the Aloha pizza, both are adventures in flavor.  They have something for just about any taste and preference, and it's great for the whole family."}
{"text":"Awesome garlic knots, meat ravioli and great staff. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I've given this place about three or four tries now, and what sticks with me is the spinach pizza experience. First time around, I order a small spinach pizza for pickup, simple. I get a large piece of flat bread with a small area of tomato sauce and cheese in the middle and approximately ten leaves of spinach. But hey, every restaurant can have a bad day.   I try again another day, and this time, I tell them on the phone: DOUBLE spinach, please! When I pick it up, I have a flat piece of chewy bread with a medium area of cheese, NO tomato sauce and FIVE leaves of spinach. Considering their pizza prices are outrageous (9 dollars for a really very small pizza and about 19 for a large that is not really impressively large at all) I really think I will be better off in the future with good frozen pizzas, or entirely home-made pizza if I have the time.  I have also tried pasta there, which was better than the pizza but extremely heavy, pretty salty and also pricy.  EDIT: I gave it another chance. Someone told me the sandwiches there were great, and hey, I tried the grilled chicken bruschetta sandwich and it really was great. Except when the bill came. I had asked if I could substitute broccoli for the fries it came with as a side, and the waitress said yes. What she didn't mention is that although broccoli, according to the sides menu, is cheaper than fries, the substitution added two dollars onto the bill. Geez."}
{"text":"This place blew me away with how delicious it was. I've been to two other Hawthornes locations before and while one was pretty good the other was horrible. This location was splendid though. Ordered a dozen garlic knots as an appetizer that were buttery and delicious, a big pepperoni pizza for the meal, perfectly cooked and a yummy, gooey, brownie with ice cream for dessert. Absolutely worth a drive down here."}
{"text":"Chicken Marsala is terrific.  ...Generous portion...even for take out.  The side serving is mashed potatoes....delicious...great comfort food selection....comes with broccoli so consider it healthy.  Wait staff very friendly and  courteous.  After only two visits,  greeted me by name.  Of course that's a nice touch."}
{"text":"Called at the last minute to order a pizza on the way home. They couldn't have been any friendlier. Upon pickup the staff could not have been nicer if they tried. I had to wait a few minutes and was offered water or anything else I might like. Usually places tell you to sit in the corner. Once I got home, the pizza was perfect - probably the best in the area and being from up North that says a lot. We will be back a few times a week I bet. Finally found our pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing and their homemade balsamic dressing is the best in town! I like it for dipping my pizza crust as well on on a Tuscan salad."}
{"text":"Hawthorne's probably has my favorite \"chill factor\" of all pizza places in Charlotte. I love the patio but even inside it's pretty comfortable.  Generally the service is pretty friendly/funny and attentive.   Their wide variety of pizzas generally will please most people (though my husband really doesn't like their crust because of blandness). I don't mind the regular crust but I regret to admit that their gluten-free crust is offensive. I like their white pies and chicken + spinach/garlic.  Their pasta dishes aren't bad and they also offer eggplant parm which though it's vegetable based is far from healthy! :) I used to like their knots but I think they're not moist enough now. or maybe I'm just getting grumpier. My favorite two things about Hawthorne's? The craveworthy cannoli for dessert and their Twitter account. Huh? All I have to do is tweet to @HawthornesPizza and easy peasy, within 2-3 tweets they deliver whatever you want ultra pronto! Now that's service and for some reason seemed way easier than ordering on the phone!  One time they knew I had surgery and couldn't leave the house and gave me an extra special treat. If you're not as lazy as that, they have a convenient To-Go counter next door closer to the back parking lot."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Charlotte! They also have great selection of salads. Their buffalo chicken calzone is also really yummy. I've been going here for years!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty average pizza place, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to dine here as nothing really stood out to me. I opted for a slice of pepperoni and it and honestly it wasn't any better than what you'd expect from a mall food court. Service was pretty standard. I did like that they had a separate section for takeout. Overall it was ok."}
{"text":"It's aight.  I've had pizza and italian here before.  It serves its purpose.  You'l leave filling full and fulfilled, but not blown away.  But, I'd come here over a national chain any day (this is a local chain)."}
{"text":"Update to my original review -   The owner, John, was gracious enough to give me a gift card to apologize for my negative experience. He clearly takes pride in his business and wants to provide a good customer experience. I haven't tried the food yet, but his kind gesture definitely deserves acknowledgment."}
{"text":"Great pizza & family friendly place. My kids love the outdoor patio. Friendly service & the manager is very involved. Good stuff."}
{"text":"First of all if you want the best pizza in Charlotte go to any of their many locations and get their pizza whole or by the slice.   Second I just finished hosting an event for my corporate team for about 175 people Bram and his family/team went above and beyond the catering call of duty helping me with odds and ends that the venue didn't assist with. Plus their by the pan menu is to die for and gives you a great bang for your buck. I work for a company that due to religious background many of our employees have very strict dietary restrictions and they accommodated for us perfectly. I have never worked with a caterer who put their best effort and love into their food and service the way that Hawthorne's did and I highly recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant, I had the Elizabeth Pizza is was very good!, I also ordered wings they were fantastic. You won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"So this was my second visit and they DID NOT disappoint!!!   My first time dining for lunch, I ordered the 2 NY slices from the lunch menu! Cooked to perfection! I also loved the garlic knots and had a bite of my co-workers cookie for dessert! It was everything!!!!!  This time around I enjoyed a side salad with a NY slice, again off the lunch menu. So filling and for only $7.95. Oh and it comes with a drink. And again we shared the cookie. I keep meaning to snap a pic but we end up devouring it before any pics can be captured lol ! You must try it !! MUST!!!   Our server was polite and friendly and the restrooms were clean and tidy! They also have an awesome mirror located near the restroom that was made for selfies!!    I'm so excited they are building a Hawthorne's close to my home in university because today I saw that kids eat free on Tuesday!!! AWESOME SAUCE !!!"}
{"text":"the food is always delicious and the staff so friendly. the location and atmosphere are added bonuses"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I like the ambiance; the restaurant was clean, and you'd be hard pressed to find a harder working server.  The food was poor.  The chicken cutlet parmigiana dinners that my Wife & I had were off in a thousand ways:  - Sauce was a little thin, and way too sweet.  - Poultry quality could've been better.  - Chicken was deep fried, instead of pan fried, and, along with the breading/seasoning, the meal tasted like a cheap spicy chicken nugget covered with sauce.  - A small slice of garlic bread was served with the entree, instead of a customary loaf of bread served before/with dinner.  Seldom do I find myself speaking poorly of a restaurant...in fact, this is my first critical review of a restaurant on Yelp."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Charlotte. I've been multiple times for both lunch and dinner. I haven't had anything on the menu that wasn't good or that I wouldn't order again.   My orders rotate between the cheese pizza, eggplant wrap, gorgonzola salad or wild mushroom ravioli. For lunch I normally sit at the bar and order a slice or a salad. Bartenders are attentive and usually will chat up an interesting conversation.   Staff is always friendly, food comes out hot and fast. The only thing I wish they did different was serve pizza by the slice all day long - it's only an option at lunch. Sometimes after work I would love to go in and grab a slice and a beer instead of ordering a whole pie - but if that's my only negative, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food is inconsistent.  Inside temp was way too hot for a summer day.  Cannot enjoy meal when I am sweating"}
{"text":"Awesome!! First time visiting this location.  It was wonderful.   Food was great as well as service. A group of us shared garlic knots always A++.  We had a few pizzas and different pastas among us.  Cajan pasta was awesome.  It's got chicken, shrimp and sausage in it. Yummm.  The manager Justin even continued to check and make sure we enjoyed everything.  I was a very happy birthday girl with my visit to this location. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great service!  Almost missed the Monday special ($1 pizza and $2.50 drafts), but they went ahead and served us anyway.  We also noshed on meatballs and broccoli - all I can say is all of the food was deceivingly delicious.  I woud normally never, ever order plain cheese pizza but for a buck you literally cannot go wrong, but in this case it was AWESOME too.  We have had the meatballs and broccolli before (both things I would have never ordered on my own, my wife wanted them) and in both cases, AWESOME again! Here's where they don't get 5 stars.  They DO have a couple of local beers on tap, but of the couple that they do, they are very safe and tame choices.  The rest of the beer menu is large brewery junk beer.  Whoever is in charge of beer for Hawthornes should be fired immediately.  It should not take a rocket scientist to realize they are behind the curve.  I hope they correct this oversight sometime soon, because while the food is great I probably won't be back until they are serving better beers."}
{"text":"Consistently good service and food. The restraurant has seen a much needed makeover in the last year as well. There is rarely a wait on what would be expected busy evenings too!"}
{"text":"Service and food was great. There were a good bit of options on the menu, including some unique picks. (Pulled Pork on Hawaiian Pizza) I hesitate to give it 5 Stars because it isn't the \"best\" pizza place I've ever been to, but still a great experience, overall."}
{"text":"Since becoming pregnant all I can stomach on a regular basis is pizza and this place has been steady in the rotation. We almost always eat there and have always had good, friendly, efficient service.   Have tried several of the apps and they are very good. Typically get a salad and small pizza and it always seems to hit the spot. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is b/c I was told they couldn't make a calzone without ricotta and that just seems strange to me and when this baby mom is not in the mood for ricotta- this simply will not do."}
{"text":"My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised how terrific our meal was here! We started with the tomato and mozzarella salad and it was the best we ever had. I had the three cheese tortellini and Lisa had the gluten free penne pomodora. They were both wonderful. Matt P our waiter recommended the fried cheesecake and we loved it. The ice cream on it has a creamy frosting taste that was perfect. Matt P provided outstanding service the whole time. We will be back soon and often! All service folks were happy and smiling and the overall experience was a \"10\""}
{"text":"I split a large Hawaiian pizza with a friend at Hawthorne's a few weeks ago.  I got way more than I asked for.  On my pizza were a plethora of toppings including pineapple, ham, bacon, Italian sausage, onions, and barbecue.  Though it still tasted great and was very filling, I was concerned that I would be charged a fortune for my \"supreme\" Hawaiian pie.  After receiving the split bill, my order came in at well under $10, with no charge for the infinite number of toppings I received.  The leftovers made for a great lunch the following day, too! Very pleased with the service and pizza here."}
{"text":"What I like about Hawthorne's is its consistancy- I know when I go here what I'm getting is the pizza the best I've ever had NO but its still good - the wings are pretty good as well.  They have a lot to offer on the menu and good beers on draft.  The patio is awesome and as long as they don't put you next to a bunch of unsupervised children you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"Hawthorne's is by far one of the easiest calls for an afternoon group dining adventure. I have plenty of close friends with one thing in common: they all have droves of children. Kids can kick, scream, stomp, and cry their way to the dinner table, but the tears dry up when pizza is thrown into the mix. What kid doesn't want pizza?   This place is magnificent for kids. Plenty of games for them to \"think\" they are playing without actually shelling out any quarters for. The make-line window for the kids to watch is brilliant. A small platform with steps up to the glass lets kids watch to their heart's content.   As for the adults, plenty of draft, and local, brews and delicious pizza. The Sicilian is one of my favorites. Deep(er) dish pizza with a mix of meats and veggies. Throw on some of their buffalo sauce and you've got a flavorful party where all of your taste buds are invited.   Service is always snappy, patio is always hoppin' and the food is dependable. Thanks, Hawthorne's. You guys know what you're doing. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this independent restaurant and was happily surprised with our visit today.  We were greeted by a smiling host and I noticed how clean of a restaurant it is even at 1pm on a Saturday.  Our waitress Lauren was very friendly and knowledgable to the menu.  Our \"Crew\" pizza was piping hot and full of flavor.  Service from start to finish spot on.  We were even told by multiple staff to enjoy our day upon exiting.  Overall a very enjoyable experience.  My only caveat is the parking; I never had liked the layout."}
{"text":"We love Hawthorne's pizza! We usually just get a large NY style pepperoni to bring home and it never disappoints. I had a personal pizza during a dine-in experience once and it was delicious, too. Maybe a little pricey, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian restaurant with multiple locations. The anti pasta salad is outstanding and the pasta is authentic to a true NY eatery."}
{"text":"Had the Garlic knots as an appetizer and an 9 inch Bbq chicken pizza. Both were delicious! One of the best pizzas I've ever had. If it's hard to choose from the great appetizers, I'd recommend the Garlic knots! The waitress was extremely friendly and polite. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"It was delicious compared to the other big name pizza places here. I still have so many more places to try but I will go back here again. It was jam packed on Friday night so go early. Very family friendly with tons of seating inside and out.  Adding this to my fav list for now!"}
{"text":"There are a few different locations which I have not yet been able to frequent but this venue seems to have it together- good location, great atmosphere, and great food. Although right around the corner from another (authentic) Italian joint, Due Amici's, I usually tend to make it out here in the event I'd like to have a brew or two with some well crafted Italian food. This location is good for either a dine-in or take-out order.  The menu is decent. There is some variety, but I think they could always use a few more items. The salads are a little overpriced for what they give you, but if you are a fan of garlic knots, you really need to try theirs! They are VERY good.   For those dining-in, the interior is impressive and much resembles that of a sports bar. Not quite an upscale venue, but great atmosphere nonetheless. Italian + brews + football = good times had by all."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I'm a \"Northerner\" now (wait, but does living in DC actually count?), but I found this place to be delightful and cheap.    Came here in a party of five and we ordered two large pizzas to share - the white pizza and a supreme.  Beers on draft were $3.  $3!  Is it always like that in Charlotte?  And if it is, does anyone need a strategy consultant?    The pizzas were delightful - great thin crust, and it was just really good.  I don't really know how else to describe it except to say that like pornography, you know it (good pizza) when you see (eat) it, and see (eat) it I did.    Jacobellis v. Ohio anyone?  Anyone?"}
{"text":"I got a calzone to take out and they burned the first one, noticed, and replaced it with a discount for the inconvenience whichI appreciate. Better than some of the pizza I've had in Charlotte, but as a Chicago native nothing can compare."}
{"text":"Haven't met anyone that doesn't like Hawthorne's Pizza.  Located at the corner of 7th and Hawthorne, it seems like this place has grown into an essential component of the neighborhood.  Especially due to the fact that Hawthorne's has a lot of family and kid-centered nights and specials.  Here's your guide to Hawthorne's...  Parking:  There is a parking lot exclusively for Hawthorne's patrons.  Even with the lot however, parking can be an issue at times.  Obviously more so during peak hours like Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings, nothing crazy, but just be warned...  Food:  Where do I start?  How about with the Carlos Sweet Wings - 7/$7.75.  I absolutely love this flavor, very unique, similar to a bar-b-lo flavor, but with more \"bar\", than \"lo\"  The calamari is excellent - some of the best, crispy, crunchy, tender, calamari I've ever eaten - the marinara sauce simply enhances your taste experience.  What about the Mussels Fra-Diablo?!  The sauce/broth they are served in works perfectly - I can inhale every last mussel within seconds!    As for the pie - the Buffalo Wing and BBQ Chicken pizzas stand out for me, I'm usually reluctant to order these styles/flavors of pizzas, but at Hawthorne's they know how to do the chicken pizzas better than any place else.  I've had most of their pastas and can vouch for them all - I like the Shrimp Scamp & Broccoli (but I ask for fettucini pasta not angel hair).  What stands out most about the pastas is that you can add whatever meat - chicken, meatballs, sausage or shrimp to any pasta. So there's def a lot of flexibility and possibilities with the pastas.    Service:  No complaints.  Service is good.  Never had any issues either seated at a table in the dining area or at the bar.   Relaxed family atmosphere, tasty food, friendly service, perfect location,  whats not to like?"}
{"text":"Good Food, but....  Listen, I like Hawthorne's.  I started my relationship with Hawthorne's @ the 7th street location, and was elated to discover there was a closer location to my residence in a shopping plaza off of Prosperity Church Rd, in north Charlotte.  I've been to this particular Hawthorne's location over 20 times in the past 4 years, and I can say I've never had a bad meal there.  Although, I can't go so far to say the food is excellent, just good.  Menu highlights include the following:  *Wings - the wings are one of the best kept secrets in Charlotte.  I like to go with the Carlo's Sweet Wings, which are some of the best and unique tasting wings in Charlotte.  You simply won't find wings in this area with a taste that compares to these wings,   *Calamari - the calamari is great.  The diablo sauce, which is like a marinara sauce, is served warm and is somewhat spicy.  It perfectly compliments the tender, fried, calamari.  Don't forget to unleash the lemon juice over the calamari before eating. *Chicken Parm - the Chicken Parmesan is a step above your standard chicken parm and is served with a healthy serving of sauce and angel hair pasta *The Carlo's Chicken Sandwhich - One of the best chicken sandwiches in all of Charlotte.  Served with a balsamic vingerette on the side, and waffle fries. I like to add avocado for a $1 extra. *The Pastas - All of the pastas served at Hawthorne's are good, some better than others depending on your personal tastes.  Also keep in mind that you can add chicken to any pasta for an additional fee.  The service at Hawthorne's is always first class.  The waitresses are always on top of things.  They are quick, efficient, and never keep you there longer than you need to be.  They are always more than willing to bring you a side of ranch or more marinara if you need.  I have always received just what I ordered, exactly how I ordered it.    MY ONE, and ONLY complaint about Hawthorne's is that it can be a bit pricey.  The calamari will run you in excess of $10 (for not a very big portion).  All of the pastas seem to be about $1.50-$3.00 more expensive than what they should be.  I hate to sound like a penny-pincher, but this just isn't the place to go if you are on a budget.   Despite the prices, Hawthorne's has consistently good food, excellent service and I will continue to be a patron of this establishment in the future."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious pizza! Our family goes here often and we can always find something everyone loves."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this location during my lunch break from classes, and second time with server Camille. The pizza has been great both times, but beware if you like ranch as much as I, it's $0.75 each additional cup and they are quite small. The food was prepared quickly, which is great due to the fact I had to be back in class within the hour. The prices are decent and I love the fact that they offer a \"by the slice\" option during lunch hours.   On to the server, Camille seems to lack a certain je ne sais quoi that every server should have, I don't know if it's due to the fact that she is just very straightforward or if she just does not enjoy her job but she comes off as slightly rude and nonchalant. Honestly, her attitude is enough to deter me from eating inside and to order to-go the next time I visit this Hawthorne's location, or request a different server."}
{"text":"We were touring Charlotte and in the mood for some new York style pizza. We found Hawthorne s Pizza to a place that we will be returning. The place looks like a converted garage and done with class.  We were greeted by a hostess at the door and seated in a booth for the 4 of us. Started out with some beers and iced tea. Beer was cold. Iced tea was a little weak. Ordered Crispy Cajun Shrimp on a bed of Cole slaw. Very tasty and would order again. We also ordered Long Island Wings. Kind of a mix between hot and sweet. The table liked the but honestly I like my wings a little hotter. I always judge the quality of the pizza with no toppings. Toppings tend to compensate for other shortcomings so we ordered a plain pie. Took about 20 minutes. The crust is thin and not too greasy on the surface. Mozzarella appears to be skim mozzarella, (which I prefer) vs whole milk.  All in all the pizza was delicious and is the closest to New York pizza. Stop by and try the t out."}
{"text":"Good food and pretty solid service. I love that they bring the kids some pizza dough to play with - definitely kept the 2y/o happy. I've had both the buffalo wrap and the Stromboli - both were really good. Prices were a little higher than I would have expected for the quantity of food, but hey, they have to make a living, right?"}
{"text":"Love having great northern pizza here in the south! Never had bad food here. The staff is always awesome too!"}
{"text":"I love Hawthornes! The food is priced appropriately. Kids menu is a coloring sheet (with two crayons provided). They also give the kids pizza dough to play with while the food is cooking. My boys ordered cheese pizza (round, individual size pizza). I had a calzone. Food was great"}
{"text":"As stated in a few of the other reviews, there is road work directly beside of the restaurant, so parking is rather limited. However, I got quite lucky and snagged a front row spot! (Always a promising omen to any outing..) The restaurant has a great little patio outside and plenty of casual indoor seating as well.   My friend and I ordered Garlic Knots and split both a small White Pizza and a small Pepperoni Pizza. The garlic knots were nothing short of incredible. That garlic butter?! Amazeballs. Just as we were finishing up our knots, the pizza arrived. It was cooked to perfection and both were great flavor combinations.  In addition to the lucky parking and delicious food, our waitress was positively delightful. She was wizard-like in anticipating our every need without hovering or being irritating in any way. She was knowledgable, sweet, and on-top-of-it in every way!"}
{"text":"Great night at Hawthorne's!! Had the portobello and spinach pasta,  super choice! Sat on the porch,  was a great night with a beautiful breeze. the drinks were super too!! not a mojito fan but the attentive management brought me the best mojito ever...made with fresh mint too! Thank you to our server and management for a great night!!"}
{"text":"This is my second favorite pizza & cannoli place in Charlotte, and it's a very tight race between 1st & 2nd. I'm a bit of a pizza snob having grown up on delicious pizza on Long Island. Amalfi's is my fav so I was disappointed when we moved to the south end of town and didn't know of any good pizza joints. Enter Hawthorne's on 7th. This is my go-to place for pizza and cannoli when I'm not in the University area."}
{"text":"I have always liked this place.  The pizza is great and also their lasagna!!  I like to come during lunch and they always have lunch specials."}
{"text":"Very good souce on pizza and chicken parmesan is perfect . friendly staff i like here is  casual place to go on week day"}
{"text":"We went and sat there for 15 min and no one ever came to the table. There were 3 people continuously walking by us we were the only people in the restaurant and we eventually just got up and left."}
{"text":"$3.50 Pints on Monday is a bonus, the pizza is average to above average but expensive with most pies in the $22.95 range for a large.  They offer Italian fare as well with a large assortment of Pastas and Baked specialties including Lasagna, Chicken Parm and Eggplant Parm. I was in the mood for Eggplant Rolotini which sounded good but ended up being presented as a plate of gooey cheese, which some people like, but completely covered up the flavor of the fried eggplant.  I would suggest that what I did get from the eggplant was that it was over breaded.  The sauce was good with chunks of tomatoes.    Service was good and the beer specials will bring me back but skipping the baked dishes next time.  Food: 2 Sporks Service:  4 Sporks Atmosphere: 3.5 Sporks  Local Beer: 3 Sporks Value: 2 Sporks"}
{"text":"Love this place! I love new York style pizza and this place does it well. My favorite is the Sicilian, worth the price, enough to take home. I also enjoy a personal pizza just for me. Mozzarella sticks were good and beer selection is always on point. they have good specials during the week like kids eat free on Tuesday. Only downside, their buffalo chicken pizza does not do it for me :( I tried it twice and I just feel like it doesn't have that kick of spice and flavor that I love out of buffalo chicken pizzas. I'll only have it again if I need my labor induced since it apparently it does the trick! :D"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon after hearing rave reviews. Nice space inside got a decent seat. Had a chicken and spinach calzone that was pretty good. Service was top notch here. Only thing negative I can say was that there were kids running all over the place, but it's all good. I was young once"}
{"text":"My lunch buddy and I were searching for something.... affordable. He eats out all the time and we came here before but I didn't eat anything.   It was pretty empty for lunch and thought I would get pizza... considering the name but I was craving fries and what better to get with fries, than a sandwich.   For a pizza joint (they have other food, yes) their sandwich was pretty good. The Bacon chicken ranch sandwich was really good. The bread was like a thick garlic knot without the garlic, but was lightly seasoned. The chicken was seasoned well. The lettuce and tomato were fresh. The cheese, ranch and Bacon added the saltiness and creaminess to the sandwich. It was pretty tasty and filling. My homie agreed.   The fries were decent.   Service was good. She came the minimum times I expect, so definitely no complaints there. $10 for all of that, I'll go back."}
{"text":"Have been going to Hawthorne's ever since the first one opened in Elizabeth. The Adams' are great guys who run a great local business. This location is closer to our home now and have been here many times. Never a bad experience - one of our favorite pizza joints in town."}
{"text":"I love the food. Best pizza in town. Try the Hawthorne's special white pizza."}
{"text":"Hawthorne's is pricey for the quality of food. It is a nice restaurant always clean and there servers are nice, but slow and they always forget something. I have been here several times and as it is one of 6 Pizza places in a 5 mile radius I think for the price they should be spectacular and they just aren't. The side salad which is 4.50 is smaller and has greens 2 cucumbers, sliced tomatoes, and onion they give you a tablespoon of dressing so you always have to ask for more. The chicken Parmesan is frozen and deep fried, served with Marinara sauce on angel hair nothing exciting going on here 13.95. And the pizza is just ok again, not amazing Elizabeth Special Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Mushrooms, Bell Peppers, White Onions And Mozzarella Cheese. 9\" 10.95. I wish I had something great to say, but I just don't."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. We ordered half veggie and half ultimate spinach pizza. The spinach pizza was awesome but veggies was just ok. I felt like the broccoli on the pizza was burnt which gave it a weird taste. They did have a great selection of beer and the patio is great to have a casual dinner."}
{"text":"This place is really a solid 3.5 stars.  Decent italian food and the pizza isn't bad either.  It is more of a tuscan style pizza which is great and the food is good.  Nothing exceptional, just solid all around food.  ALso, the amount you get for your money isn't too bad.  I always left here needing a wheelbarrow to leave, but thats because I over order.   All in all, just a solid place to grab some italian food if you don't feel like going somewhere \"classy\" so to speak."}
{"text":"Very adequate restaurant that gets enough things right that I can't not recommend this location for families. That being said, the wait staff is hit or miss, with random long wait times on food and drink if dining in.  The menu is an assortment of fairly standard dishes, so nothing stands out as a \"signature\" or \"must get\" dish...That's not a bad thing though, as there also isn't any particular item that isn't tasty. The ingredients that seem to go into each meal, feel and taste like something you could pluck from your own pantry."}
{"text":"Like others, I've lived in NYC & Chicago so trying to find the pizza place in CLT that will just hit the spot.  Hawthorne has great thin slices.  I love deep dish & would love if they had deep dish version.  The pizza is similar to NYC the large slices that for a single girl are easily considered a meal.  The service was spot on.  We'll give this another go & try the garlic knots."}
{"text":"had the greek salad w shrimp and veg pizza...found them both tasty and savory although my salad could have used more tomatoes"}
{"text":"So you're in the mood for pizza huh? Well this a good, just over average pizza joint. The service is usually pretty on point. A great spot to meet up with friends just before going out on the town. The wings here are better than some of their competitor's. And like most pizza joints, they have great pasta dishes too. Come, relax, be full."}
{"text":"This location has gone, in my book, from five star best pizza in CLT only a few years ago, to three star pretty mediocre very quickly, I am sad to report. Why?  Pizza itself seems different; namely, the crust. Have they started using different ingredients in the crust?  Not sure, but it is starting to taste a bit off - you can taste that problem even more easily when you reheat the pizza. Noticed it for the first time perhaps a year ago.   Other issues?  Some staff at this location are very friendly; others look at groups with little kids (to wit, us) and seem to overtly groan- and then aren't that friendly to deal with. But, I guess if you're a waiter, kids are a pain: they can be noisy, make a mess, and don't usually spend a lot ok booze. However, since it seems to hold itself out as kid friendly, they could prepare their staff better for the possibility of families showing up.   And, in a town with some pricey pizza places (yes Wolfman, I am looking at you), Hawthorne's seems a little costly for what it is (regular NY pizza).   Still, we continue to eat here often and I hope they sort out whatever that issue is with the crust - it would start to creep back to four stars if they did!  And it would be great if they delivered."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Started out with Chili Queso Dip. The chips they brought with it must have been from the bottom of the bag. All about the size of a quarter or less. Difficult to dip when they are that small. Then had the pizza of the day. (Taco) When ordering I asked if it had onions on it. Waiter said it did but could be made without. When I went to eat it, I found onions on it. I told the waiter, he took it back to the kitchen, and brought it back to me. He asked me to show him where the onions were. When I pointed them out, he told me it was lettuce. I'm no Chef, but I know the difference between onion and lettuce. I told him I couldn't eat it, and he took it away. No offer for something else, nor did he take it off the bill. I had my departments Christmas party here last year, and was planning it again this year. We will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and wings. The pizza was def a hit! I do recommend this place and they have a full size arcade inside. Great place to bring the kids or to simply sit down and have done drinks. The service us friendly."}
{"text":"I love the Ballantyne Hawthorne's and this store is on my way home from work, I thought I would give it a try.    This location, situated in a strip center at the corner of Quail Hollow and Carmel is easy enough to find, and get into and out of no matter which direction you'll go when leaving.  Parking was ample.  Arriving around 5:30 on a Friday evening, there were only a couple of other tables sat.  The staff, dressed all in black, was standing around in groups.  Both young men standing at the host stand had their backs to the door and I had to make myself known.  The restaurant is loud, just from the hum of business.  I then saw a gentleman with balloons strung around his waist making balloon creations.  You know what else carries balloons?  Clowns.  I hate clowns.  And while trying to enjoy my dinner, balloon squeaks and eventual pops was really not what I was looking forward to as a way to end my work week.  Tables that were sat after me got wait service before I did.  I was regretting my decision to not just head to the Ballantyne location.  Because of the lack of crumb snatchers in the restaurant, the balloon dude then made some for the stagnant wait staff. But the food would be great, right?  Yeah!  The food: Mozzarella sticks ($6.95):  6 small sticks served with marinara.  Thick coating on the sticks that tasted a little bland, but you don't want to overpower the cheese.  Marinara was tasty.  Not worth $7, but fine. 9\" white pizza ($9):  I love white pizza and it is usually really good or really bad - this was good.  It hit the table smoking hot, cut into 4 pieces on a small pizza pan with a pizza serving spatula.  The crust was thin and crispy.   Diet Coke to drink (yay Coke products) and it was kept full by my quiet waiter.    I was too full for dessert, but it looked like there were some good choices.  I watch Hawthorne's Facebook page and they do a lot of work with the community and with kids eating free on Tuesdays and a balloon guy, they are definitely family friendly.  LOTS of people came in and out with takeout orders, so it stayed steady for business.    The food was a 4, the overall experience was a 3 though - I'll continue to support Hawthorne's and their great pizza at the Ballantyne location."}
{"text":"Hawthorne's is known for their buffalo chicken pizza that induces labor in expectant moms. In the past 12 months 134 \"mother to be\" have gone into labor 24 hours after eating the inducer pizza."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Hawthorne's.  It's the perfect place for a meal in the springtime because of their massive patio.  The salads were fresh and the pizza was great.  You get a lot for your money.  Also, while I didn't get a chance to try the garlic knots, they looked awesome! I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday nite and it was crowded but we were seated right away.  I cannot say enough good things about our waitress Brittany. She was so professional and attentive!   We got the Cajun shrimp for an appetizer and then the Elizabeth Pizza.  The shrimp were breaded and spicy and were in a bed of slaw.  The pizza was excellent, just as good as the pizza we recently got in NYC that was supposed to be the best.  We don't often venture up into mint hill but we will return."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Hawthorne's! Adam Mark is a great bartender! He went over the specials and the experiencewas great! I enjoyed the slice of the day which was the crew pizza! Management was great and I will definantly be back!"}
{"text":"Hawthorne's is like the superhero of pizza shops.  Mild mannered and family friendly during the day and primed to party at night. If you want to know what their pizza is like, look at the name of the joint.  It is NY style pizza.  This is the stuff that you see diet conscious people either picking up their slice and letting the grease drip off of or are dabbing it with a paper napkin.  I say let it stay. They also have a solid italian menu beyond just pizza with great pasta dishes.  You can't go wrong with baked ziti. Their pizza by the slice is part of their very reasonable lunch menu, but it also makes a return on the late night menu.  And trust me, sometimes you just need a slice after 11pm.   One such reason would be their Monday night special...  $1.50 drafts.  Now, usually when someone runs such a special, you look at the taps and read the names of watered down domestics.  Not here.  This is your New Castle, your Guinness, your Blue Moon, et cetera.  All of which taste good in the evening air out on the patio. The service is great and if Johnny V. is behind the bar, its a guaranteed good time."}
{"text":"What has happened to Hawthorne's?? Been pretty loyal customers for several years however we have noticed a huge decline in service and quality of food. Several weeks ago we went and were served cold food. In fact one dish was lacking ingredients mentioned on the menu.  On Friday night we arrived around 7pm and asked for a table outside for 7 people. The hostess told us it would be at least 30 minutes which was fine since we were happy to wait in the bar until we were called. About 15 minutes later the hostess arrived and said our table was ready. She then led us to a table in the back of the restaurant. I asked about the table outside and she said that we would need to wait at least another 45 minutes.  We sat down and waited and were recognized within a few minutes. Our order was taken and our appetizers arrived quickly and we ordered our next round of drinks and we placed our   order for dinner and then waited at least 20 minutes before she came back. She did not have our drinks but wanted to check on us, we again mentioned our drinks. Around 10 minutes later another waiter noticed our empty drinks and asked us is we needed any thing - we mentioned our drinks, He brought us our drinks a few minutes later. Our food arrived except for my salad and part of the meal of my friend (wings). The waitress said it would be a few minutes. 15 minutes later my salad arrived along with his wings. I noticed that on my salad Instead of croutons they had placed pieces of untoasted bread. The waitress never came back except to bring our bill which included the salad and the wings. I asked the manager to come over - I told him of our experience and disappointment. He mumbled, grabbed our checks and walked away. He did take off the salad and the wings. Overall the experience left us disappointed. We were glad to see The Char Bar setting up a location next door. Offering similar food at a similar price point - at least we will have anther alternative."}
{"text":"This is an average New York pizza shop located in Charlotte.   I say that because, as a function of scarcity, it gets 4-stars... there simply aren't any other pizza shops that compete in Charlotte. That being said, it'll be standard fare in New York.  Pizza:  Since moving here three years ago, Hawthornes is the only pizza in Charlotte that does pizza the way I'm used to it. No, that's not the RIGHT way necessarily, just that it's the closest I've had to NY pizza since moving.  Food:  The other dishes are 3/5 for the most part, but the pizza is comfort enough for me.  It's definite Italian American (ie. calzones, chicken parm, etc.) and it does that reasonably well.  Staff: Most are kind and helpful, one or two will leave you wishing for a bit more.  Drinks:  All tap beers are 2.75 T-S and 1.50 on Mondays.  Great spot for Pizza and Beer.  They have to go service but do not deliver."}
{"text":"Good food and a staff that excels!   Hawthorne's has several locations but I have only dined at the one in Mint Hill.  I have always found it to be clean, friendly, and prompt.  The menu has a nice variety.  I have sampled several of their pasta dishes, a couple of the sandwiches, and of course their pizza.  I have always found the food to be full of flavor and freshly prepared.    The bar is full service and has a decent selection of craft beers, even some locals ones show up, which I think is really great.  ( I have a big dedication to local business.)  The bar is an especially nice to watch the game, though there are huge TVs throughout the restaurant.    The real star of this place, in my opinion, is their staff.  Ellen (our usual waitress) is one of the most thoughtful waitresses I've ever seen.  If she has a well deserved night off, we ask for Fernando.  Yet another great waiter who makes your dining experience very enjoyable.  The staff as a whole works together and that, too, is a nice experience.  To me, dining here feels like hanging out with some friends.  Add some good food and what more can you ask for?  Check them out, you won't regret it.    Also.. if for some reason you feel something needs attention, please ask for a manager.  I have talked to a couple of the managers here and they really do want to make sure everyone is happy."}
{"text":"The University location of Hawthorne's NY Pizza is the only one of the three I have been to, but after this trip, I may have to check out the other two as well.  I am somewhat of a pizza fan, the kind of person who thinks the only bad pizza is the one not in front of me.  Located in a shopping area beside Dilworth Coffeehouse (which, oddly enough, is nowhere near Dilworth) the restaurant is decent-sized, with a small patio area containing roughly 7 or 8 tables.   A handful of flat-screen tvs float above the bar inside...basically, the normal acoutrements you would expect from a pizza restaurant.  Now to the good part: the pizza. After seriously considering the Buffalo Chicken pizza, I settled on the Chicken Parmesan pizza instead. Good choice. Wow, one of the best pizzas I've had!  To top it off, the couple of Bacardi and Cokes I ordered were sufficiently stout.  Add in a friendly wait staff and you have a good recipe for a relaxing, if low-key, pizza joint with at least one excellent item on the menu!"}
{"text":"We live in the area and eat here about once per week. The pizza is good, the atmosphere is great and we have never had a problem with the service (except for my comment below). The manager frequently comes out to check on things. Our favorites include the calamari, cheese sticks, and greek pizza. They also have a good beer selection. During football season, we love to come here and watch games.   I will still give them 5 stars but there is one hostess who just looks at us whenever we come into the restaurant. We have to tell her that we would like a table for two. It seems like it would be better customer service to say hello to customers and ask them if they would like a table, rather than waiting for them to ask you. Other than her, all of the other employees are great."}
{"text":"The service was great for my pick-up order, every staff member I interacted with was very pleasant, including a host holding the door open for me as I left -- chivalry isn't dead!   However, my pizza was a little disappointing. I ordered the Chicken Bacon Ranch on gluten-free crust and I thought there was a little too much ranch. I did like the gf crust though, so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"My last visit the quality had gone down and the pizza was not something I would go back for.  I long praised their consistency between stores, but after having a very blah pizza at one of their South Charlotte stores, I revoke my praise :("}
{"text":"Pizza was good - pepperoni and mushrooms.  They were out of the NoDa beer I wanted.  The service was better than average.  I will go back.  Great place for kids too. The side salad was good also."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I've been here many times and while the service is always just average, the food is pretty good.  However, yesterday I ordered crab cake sandwich, which was the special.  The crab cake was so burnt it looked like a flattened hockey puck.  I'm not sure how something like that ever got out of the kitchen.    What was even more disappointing was the reaction of the manager.  After I sent it back I ordered the queso dip.  After a lengthy wait, the manager brought the dip and just sat it on the table.  Didn't even speak a word.  It will be a while before I return."}
{"text":"Food looked marvelous, could have a bit more flavor. We wouldn't mind coming back and trying different items."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite pizza places in Charlotte until I discovered Tony's in Ballantyne and Libretto's, but I still love the location and it is perfect for meeting friends for a beer or glass of wine and sharing a pie.  The garlic knots are still pretty tasty and frickin HUGE! The staff is super friendly and very accomadating.  Even though their pizza is not #1 in my heart their pasta dishes are absolutely delicious.  I love love loved teh sauce for the gueyere penne and I substituted the suggested chicken or sausage with shrimp yummmmm.  The lasagna made me never want to make my own at home again!  I think the pizza has plenty of cheese and good taste they just need a crisper crust.  I have not visited any other locations and I do not feel the desire to.  The location in Elizabeth is pretty great all around."}
{"text":"My sandwich was great and the french fries and the service was great also. My wife said her pizza was not good I agree it was not great. I would definitely go back there again and the only reason it doesn't get five stars is because the pizza crust was a little hard and cardboard like."}
{"text":"So far the company is excellent but Hawthorns so far has great sweet tea. It isn't the overly sweet sugar water that other places serve. I ordered the homemade potato chips. We also had seven of the Caribbean wings as appetizers. Both were very tasty. For lunch we ordered two 9\" pizzas a meatlovers and a spinach & garlic. Both were excellent and we had leftovers. The dessert was a shared piece of New York cheesecake with raspberry coulis. It was excellent as well. Our server was April was great. She was polite & professional & she gave us honest opinions of the different sauces on the wings. I look forward to dining there again."}
{"text":"We beat the lunch crowd and were seated inside. The fans froze us and we opted to move outside. Excellent decision, the patio was perfect before the hot hot heat (not the band) arrived . Our server was excellent and was extremely patient as we went back and forth over what pizzas we wanted to try. Not to mention he was on top of our drink refills every time.  i glanced through some Yelp reviews before heading here and happened to remember someone saying the Garlic Knots were \"TO DIE FOR\". i don't know if i'd die for a garlic knot, however these garlic knots were delish. Meat lovers pizza was the specialty slice of the day and was pretty good. Spinach pizza was so-so, kind of plain (as i expected as the ingredients were spinach and cheese, but told the wife to try it since i was getting my own slices). We wouldn't get the spinach pizza  It didn't wow me enough to add to the list of repeat restaurants, but not a bad place."}
{"text":"Great food, affordable, two small pizzas were $9 a piece and I can't remember the price of the beer. $4 or so. Outside was full so we had to sit inside and there were a lot of kids. I don't know if this is the norm. Everything was great, would've been a 5 star review but the waiter was strange and rude. Don't remember his name. I'd recommend this place and just pray you don't get him."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte hands down. Gourmet ingredients with reasonable prices when people come into Charlotte I always take them here!"}
{"text":"This Yelp application is quite quirky, but I want to update my review to say that this has to date, been the most consistent, the most reliable, and the best place I've been able to have a great lunch or dinner to date.   I have never had a bad dish yet, and I've eaten pretty much everything on their menu over the past couple of years. Now I will say tonight I tried something new. And that was the mussles.   There were a lot of mussles that were closed, but all I had to do was politely ask the waitress if this was kind of normal for this dish? I really didn't know.  She had the manager over in the blink of an eye. He apologized and, even though quite honestly, I didn't require a replacement dish, they went ahead and proactively said - you know what?  that's not right and we're going to make it right and they gave me a replacement set of mussels.   It's just another example of how awesome Hawthornes is. I'm not kidding folks how many places would do that? And I kind of felt bad because I really didn't want to replace the whole darn dish.  I didn't ask for it, and I'm not one to complain quite honestly, but they are on top of every single experience - positive or negative - that you have. So kind of this was not a surprise. I'm just pleasantly surprised I guess I should say.  I don't know folks, the food is fantastic but I'm going to tell you if something is not up to snuff and you're respectful about it - they are right on top of it and they address it.   Honestly this is my favorite place to be any day of the week but the fact that they went over and above, even though I wasn't asking them to? They've got my business, they will always have my business.   I'll give him five stars, every dish without a doubt, and let me tell you I've posted a lot of reviews on Yelp and on Google and I've never had a bad dish yet at Hawthornes.   All I'm saying is....if you want a stand up, great meal, great service (we love and adore Dana!!) this place is the place to be."}
{"text":"I just recently moved within walking distance to hawthornes and really wanted to like it. I was hoping that I could have a neighbor hood pizza joint to enjoy. Unfortunately I have tried it twice and both times it has fallen short. First time I ordered a pizza and buffalo chicken Stromboli. The pizza was decent although a little soggy and I asked for crispy. The buffalo chicken Stromboli on the other hand was just bread. It had very little flavor and even less chicken. I have been working in restaurants for tears now and never like to complain but I actually felt the need to call them about the Stromboli. I was told the manager would call me the next day and when the day came and went I called her. I believe her name is Michelle. I was told she would leave a gift certificate so we could try it again. So tonight we tried and ordered a Cajun chicken Philly. When we went to pick it up they had no idea we were suppose to have a credit which was frustrating but we left with the Philly. And again I am not impressed with the food, and this time the customer service as well. We had high hopes but keep getting let down. Oh well just one place to cross off the list."}
{"text":"NOT GOOD!! Not authentic NY pizza what-so-ever. First of all, they only serve slices at lunch. WTF!? You can't claim to be NY pizza and not serve slices. That's how the pizza gets so crispy is being baked by the slice. Never mind that, the pizza is actually very mediocre. On a good day, it's only marginally better than Papa John's.  The service is usually very poor and slow. The employees usually congregate behind the bar and chit chat while you need basic things like napkins or drink refills.  The ambiance is generally kind of sad, usually pretty empty and dark. No surprise there! My final complaint about this place is its overpriced / priced unfairly.  For example, a large cheese pizza is $14, but a single topping is $3. So two toppings almost equal an entire pizza? Meanwhile you can get any of their signature pizzas with 6+ toppings for $21.  The pasta portions are incredibly small for how much you're paying.  The wings are breaded! Are you serious!? Who the heck breads wings!? Oh, I get it, it makes them look bigger and more filling.  I will be sure to steer other away from this place!"}
{"text":"We have just discovered not only the best, most authentic Italian food outside of Italy, but the best value as well. This is a guaranteed 5 star meal with 5 star service at the most reasonable prices We have tried the lasagna, chicken Parmesan, manicotti and garlic knots. You will not be disappointed. The chef wins awards for his chili. This staff genuinely wants to send you home happy."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  Delicious food every time.  The Tuscan Salad is one of my favorite dishes, and get the pesto pizza with pepperoni on it.  YUM!"}
{"text":"The food is very good but I have a major problem with a place that wants to charge 75 cents for an extra side of dressing when I just spent $40 with them. When you order 12 wings and they only want to give to 2 small cups of dressing. Wings without dressing are no good and I should not have to pay extra to have enough dressing for my wings. For these reason alone I will take my business to another establishment."}
{"text":"I love pizza and I love beer. It's my opinion that they are wonderfully made for each other. Not so at Hawthorn's.  The beer options are limited and the pizza is nothing special. It was a Friday night, about 7:30, we had a few appetizers to start the night and none were that good. The calamari was bland, garlic knots were warm and a bit tough. Since the pizza is the main attraction, I expected so much more. We had four different styles and the only one worth having a second piece was the meat pizza. If the pizza was the only criteria to judge this restaurant on it would still loose, unfortunately for them the service wasn't any better than the food. The atmosphere is extremely loud so be ready to yell across your table or wave flags to get someone's attention. Sad to say, when I come back to the area I'll go back to Wolfman Pizza!!  Never again to Hawthornes!!"}
{"text":"This was the closest \"bar\" or pizza spot for me to watch the Panthers game. I've had hawthornes pizza before and remembered it being a little better but it was still good. The garlic knots were hands down my favorite item I ordered ! They are huge and the marinara sauce was amazing. I could've just ate the knots and sauce and been happy."}
{"text":"Garlic knots were really good , I tried their shrimp appetizers, can't complain about them and I also loved their waffle fries with cheese, only downside is that they stop serving slices after lunch but they have half off appetizers afterwards."}
{"text":"I absolute love this place. I ask my fiancé almost once a week if he wants to eat here. The pasta is delicious and the salads are great. The antipasto salad is my favorite. We haven't gotten pizza yet but I'm sure it's delicious. The sauces are great! The staff is super friendly as well."}
{"text":"Never been to the original location, but frequent the Mint Hill location. Overall the place is great. They are known for their pizza, which is great, but they also have good sandwiches and the queso dip is awesome. Service is also good. If the prices were a little lower it would be exceptional."}
{"text":"Pizza is good and the wings are great- just over priced. Which is a bummer cause it tastes really good!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza. I just recently tried it and brough home 2 types of pizza. The decor at this place is very cool and would be a fun place to take a group of friends. The bartender had an attitude, but since it was my first time I'm letting it slide; oh yeah- THEY HAVE FIREFLY- :)"}
{"text":"I built my own 9\" pizza. Having lived in the Northeast, this \"pizza\" was a disgrace to NY and to pizzas everywhere. The dough was soggy and tasted like a piece of bread that has been left outside in the rain for 2 days. The pie itself tasted as if the chef put mushrooms, green peppers, and onions in a blender and poured them onto the watery dough with cheese. Definitely worst pizza i ever had"}
{"text":"Ya know how you work at some restaurants and then absolutely refuse to go back because you just don't want the food anymore? It's disgusting, you ate too much of it, whatever... THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH HAWTHORNES! I worked here YEARS ago as a student at CPCC and I still look forward to my 8\" cheese pie with loads of parmesan cheese! The garlic knots are to die for and I just can't say enough great things about Hawthorne's. Love the atmosphere, love the drink specials and the pizza is always perfect. Plus a lot of the people that worked there years ago are still there and they're all great company. I always love going back!"}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood and got the barbecue chicken pizza - it was just the right amount of sweet. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Go there on a Tuesday and a slice is 1$. They don't serve slices after 2pm. Staff was pretty friendly. Had to wait a while. Pizza is super greasy but I'm from NJ so it wasn't a problem. Nice environment."}
{"text":"Hawthrones was exactly what I needed after a day at the US White Water Center! The drinks were cheap and delicious, the garlic knots were AMAZING and the pizza was so tasty. I would have liked the pizza to have a little less grease but that's a personal preference and I will absolutely be back again!"}
{"text":"I went here for a family lunch and was pleasantly pleased. We ordered a pizza half veggie and the other half cheese and I was in Pizza heaven. The service was fantastic and they have beautiful outdoor patio seating. If you haven't been here check them out!! Not to mention they have cool beer specials!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a Calzone with 2 additional toppings; spinach and red onions. The spinach was horrible, it tasted frozen and it had no seasoning. For the price I would have expected much better. I also had the Caribbean wings and they gave me 6 instead of the 7 they charged me for. The wings weren't even good, I ate 2 and then gave the rest away. I will not order from them again. Overpriced and the food is not good!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Charlotte. We love the large New York Style pies. They truly remind me of the pizza back up north.  For a predominately pizza place, their other entrees are impressively good too! I really love their large entree salads. My husband and I will often get an antipasto salad as well as a pizza.   Last time I was there I also had their gluten free penne pasta. it was delicious! The upcharge for the specialty pasta was a tad high ($4) but it was worth it to me to not get the terrible stomach ache after.  The beer selection is good too. And they have a few ciders and wines. They even have a covered patio so you can bring your pup on a leash with you, even when it's raining.   One thing we also like about this place is the convenience of the separate \"To Go\" section. No awkward waiting in line or standing by the bar in the middle of a busy restaurant. Which I appreciate."}
{"text":"I left a review 2 months ago & was asked to contact them via email. I still haven't received a response. Annoying considering the fact that I took time out of my day to write the email. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"If you're hungry for some authentic-ish New York style pizza then give this place a try. Huge portions, decent pricing for what you get, & uber tastiness. We had the Meat Eaters Pie which had a generous portion of the 5 main meats, and it wasn't too greasy. We also had the garlic knots which are fist sized & covered in garlic oil & bits of crush cloves, super yum. Highly recommended, highly."}
{"text":"So delicious! Came for the \"inducer\" pizza. While it was so good my princess decided she wasn't coming out for any pizza lol. We also had spinach and artichoke dip which was perfect."}
{"text":"By Charlotte standards, Hawthorne's has good New York style pizza. I'm a fan of most of their pizza toppings and flavors, but I especially like the Elizabeth Special, which includes pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and cheese.   Hawthorne's is a good place to meet friends for some pizza and a beer.  I also really like the outdoor patio, especially on a nice summer day."}
{"text":"We love Hawthorne's! It's a terrific neighborhood spot and consistently delivers. From the moment you walk in the door, be prepared to be greeted by the host staff (sometimes by name!) and good service by energetic staff. The takeout crew is very friendly and although sometimes very busy, always take time to make sure your order is correct. We recommend this restaurant to everyone in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Soooo was 36 weeks pregnant, had the inducer pizza at around 9pm just for fun and I started having contractions at midnight and had our baby girl the next day!!! Manager was amazing, telling us all the success stories and whatnot. Will be back for our next pregnancy. BTW pizza was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great little place close to home.  We went with the dinners since it was \"Prince Spaghetti Night\" (every Wednesday) and were pleasantly awarded with some great pasta dishes.  It's hard to mess up Baked Ziti, but it's also hard to make it \"Wow\".  Hawthorne's did just that.  The right amount of sauce, cheeses, and pasta make for a great dish all around.  The service was top-notch without any need to ask for re-fills.  Their beer selection was decent, and the prices were well within the competitive range.  The do have a $1.50 draft night on Monday, which will get me thinkin' about heading out for Monday Night Football.  Speaking of...they do have several large televisions on each wall that would make for watching the game quite easy in a great atmosphere. Noosh!"}
{"text":"The pizza was great and the servers were happy it was like they wanted to come to work and the pizza I got was sweet sausage and basil and the basil was fresh and tested home grown. The pizza was fast and with two people trying to eat it all we couldn't I would come back here and the pizza is really affordable"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service. We were in Charlotte visiting from California and I love Italian food and I loved everything I ordered!! Their buffalo chicken pizza was very good and omg their baked ziti with meatballs was delicious. My kids are picky pizza eaters and we ordered a 18inch pepperoni cheese and they ate everything! Would deff return here every time we are in Charlotte"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick munch & a couple beers.  We were greeted by Megan at the bar & she made our experience FANTASTIC!!!!  Very friendly, knowledgable & took great pride in the establishment and her work.  The chili queso is delicious and a variety of good beers."}
{"text":"First time at this location for lunch today. Not too busy. Selections on the menu were plenty. Prices fair. We were fortunate to have a lovey waitress (wish I remember her name) blond hair braces who took amazing care of us. She was on top of it. Drinks always full and real nice to our small baby. Will definitely return and highly recommend."}
{"text":"I felt very happy after the friendly staff served up a hot pizza to our table. The three of us were very impressed with the food and the service . Ofcourse behind the bar was on point as usual with Sam at the helm. Great pizza! Thanks for bringing this resteraunt to Mint Hill. I would say 5 stars but the food is a tad bit pricey . I would come more often if the prices were a bit lower."}
{"text":"THE best pizza in Charlotte/Uptown area. We live a block away, so that is what brought us there initially. It is a regular 2 X a week stop for us now. We always sit at the bar. The staff are very welcoming, remember what we drink, ask how we are, etc....They \"get it\" in regards to service. It is a very chill, relaxed place and that is what I like. The house salad is very fresh, balsamic dressing too. The pizza is what keeps me coming back. We have never had anything but salad and pizza and we will continue to come back. Great pizza, awesome location and even better staff! Especially at the bar! The patio rocks, too!"}
{"text":"Painter Smurf and I decided to check out Hawthorne's for lunch today.... And for you New Yorkers... Welcome home, big floppy style pizza, with a crispy crust and fresh toppings.  They also offer a great wine list, cocktail selection, and bar setting if that's your thing. I had the cheeseburger pizza, and the tomatoes were to fresh, sweet and juicy, that I had to catch the juice with my napkin whenever I took a bite. The staff greeted me quickly, and I didn't have to wait long for a waiter even though it was lunch time. For a quick lunch I'd recommend Hawthorne's any day of the week. :-)"}
{"text":"this place is near my house. it has become my hangout not only because it is cliose but the food is great.$2.50 draft beers on mondays."}
{"text":"We just ate here this evening. We were promptly greeted & seated. We got the garlic knots, which is a MUST HAVE! Oh my heavens, talk about delicious!! My mom & I split the manicotti, which was the best manicotti we have ever had (and we are pasta lovers, with lots of experience). My fiancé had a calzone which was also very yummy & fresh! My favorite part of this experience was overhearing Dave, the manager giving a newer hostess feedback on her performance. He was so pleasant, and let her know what a great job she was doing. It was SO nice to overhear that because you just don't hear that much anymore. We will definitely be back, and highly recommend this place! It's also very Family / kid friendly!"}
{"text":"I love trying new places and I haven't been here to eat yet. I literally pass this place everyday on and from work.  The staff was very friendly as soon as I came into the door! I told them I felt lazy cooking tonight so they told me some popular dishes. They told me the chicken Parmesan was super good and the price wasn't bad.  I'm super excited to have it! I love chicken Parmesan   The wait wasn't that long and the parking was great. Felt great inside, nice vibes and chill music playing. Staff even offered me a drink while I was waiting on my food.   UPDATE!  Get the Chicken parm"}
{"text":"It really pains me to have to write this re-review. But I feel if I don't I would be doing a disservice to all Charlotte Yelpers who may find themselves in the same horrible, horrible, dining experience I had this afternoon.  I used to LOVE this place. I used to suggest it to all my friends, raving about the great NY style pizza, great atmosphere, and great service. Today I feel like I ate at a completely different restaurant.   Hostess was very sweet, cleaning off a table for us outside. We were sat, and then we sat. and sat. and sat. No one came over to even acknowledge us. After finally tracking down our waitress, we placed our drink orders and and ordered Mozz sticks app. About 10 min went by. Then 15, and I started wondering if they were brewing my beer behind the bar. As i sat there waiting for our drinks for about 20 min, I started noticing a few weird things about our waitress \"New Lisa\" as it said on our receipt. She was honestly acting like she had taken something the night before, or that morning who knows, and it was still in her system for sure. Seemed like she was just wandering around lost, every table she had was constantly asking for refills, their check, etc.... There was something way more wrong there than her just being \"new\".   When our food finally made it, she couldn't even remember who had ordered what out of all 2 OF US AT THE TABLE. And to top it all off the food was disgusting. Mozz sticks were obviously frozen,sauce had no flavor. I got chick parm stromboli, it came out soggy, somewhat cold, and just gross. My wife got the meat ravioli, she said they were ok, probably frozen as well,but the sauce they were buried in was pretty unbearable. I remember fresh ingredients from this place, no more.....  I don't know if something major has gone on here in the past 6 months or so, but I will never be back after this experience. When you have 2 full plates of food left sitting on the table, I literally took 2 bites, and no one says anything it speaks miles about the apathy of this restaurant., staff, & ownership.  Knowing its the same ownership group of  some other local favorites of mine, I will not be supporting any of their food until the issues are addressed and big changes are made. I will make sure everyone I know who has eaten at this restaurant is well aware of the type of service and food this establishment offers.  Excuse me while I morn the loss of one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I ordered an Italian sandwich cold...  I cannot tell you if there Italian sandwich cold is any good or not- I did not receive an Italian nor was it cold!  I had trouble placing the order and had to correct the order taker twice.  Someone else picked it up for me and I warned them about the confusion with the order- and asked that she have them confirm when she arrived.  She did i fact check ask them to check it - they opened and told her it was an Italian no salami cold with fries... It wasn't!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place in hopefully an up and coming area of town. Pretty cool patio that will be great to take advantage of on a summer evening (also dog friendly). The Pizza was amazing and no complaints about the service as well. My only suggestion would be some shade on the patio. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza bar in the Prosperity Church Road area. I enjoy the pizza but I also really enjoy the wings( Long Island flavor ). My running group meets here after our weekly run for a beer. This is also a place that's great to take your kids."}
{"text":"Buffalo wing style pizza .... Of coarse when you hear this you think it will taste marvelous. But please be advised it was the worst pizza I had in my life. Literally I had to take it to go just so I could show my friends and roommate how nasty it tasted! Walmart microwave pizza would of been better"}
{"text":"My recommendation for anyone eating at Hawthorne's is to order a large pizza and split it with office buddies. Their large cheese pizza is some of the closest you'll get to authentic big, floppy New York style stuff in Charlotte.  I'm not crazy about the rest of their menu, and the service I've gotten the few times I've been in has been spotty at best; however, the deliciousness of the large, plain cheese pizzas make up for all of it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this pizza. Crisp, yet chewy crust, fresh tasting toppings, and real cheese oozing hot from the oven. The meats seem very real and less processed then other pizza joints, so don't order  pepperoni and expect it to be a dry, healthful pizza. It's going to be lusciously moist and slightly greasy. Their sausage &  pepperoni Sicilian takes a little while longer to make, but showcases the quality if their crust even better than the original.   If I had kids, I would totally buy their \"year's worth of pizza\" deal and make every Friday night dinner pizza night. I like it that much -- eating it once a week would be completely ok with me. Alas, I have no kids and am generally drinking somewhere on Fridays. I've only been there late at night, so I've yet to encounter the hordes of children said to down the dining room each evening. However, their bar staff is friendly and their beer pours are on point."}
{"text":"Good pizza, family-friendly, and good service. Of course there's no comparison to authentic NY pizza , but it was good. Our waitress Lindsay was extremely knowledgeable with the menu and was a great waitress. That was our family's favorite part of dinner. Thanks so much Lindsay! You're awesome! We will ask for you next time."}
{"text":"We've only had pizza and beer at Hawthorne's and I can say they were as good if not better than friends told us. Growing up in the north a pizza person tends compare any and all pizza to that. Or maybe I'm the only only who does so, that said we'll be back. Our service was attentive but not over bearing, server was extremely kind and friendly. Our pizza had just the right amount of sauce vs cheese, as well as toppings for those who do toppings. The best pizza is cheese only if left to me, therefore the sauce must be good. I honestly have nothing other than great things to say about Hawthorne's, I'm certain we will be back when on that side of town!! The best news ever.......I just realized there is a Hawthorne's very close by!! They offer several draft as well as bottle beer, the draft was ice cold, the best way to enjoy a great pizza!! Thanks Hawthorne's for having great pizza!!"}
{"text":"Was here Sunday for hangover pizza with the boyfriend.  It was full for a rare rainy day in Charlotte - keep in mind this is very FAMILY oriented during the day.  So we were surrounded by kids which are cute when they are not yelling and chasing each other around the restaurant.  There is a little platform for the kiddies to walk up and watch the pizza makers - which is adorable for about five seconds.  If you cant stand the idea of lots of kids just eat in the bar...really it isnt bad!  We got the side salad for $3.95 which is more than enough to split between two people (the balsamic vinaigrette is just fine here).  And we got the 18 inch Crew pizza which is very good - crust is crispy, the pizza is thin and comes with slices of meatballs, italian sausage and banana peppers.  Everything was very good!  I think our total bill was $24 before tip (no drinks) so that is reasonable enough for me!    Service has always been spotty here unless you are sitting at the bar.  I would definitely recommend getting some sort of app if you are ordering a whole pizza cause a whole pizza definitely takes time to make and cook so you may starve waiting unless you have something to nibble on!   I am from NY so I am a harsh judge.  I have had a lot of 'good' NY style pizza in Charlotte....Hawthorne is definitely A-OK.  PS - The best thing about Hawthorne's is the take-out wing they put in where my cute dry-cleaning lady used to be.  I have been picking up pizzas here before and either someone was a no-show or some order got scewed up and they have asked me if i wanted the rejected pie for free - why yes of course who can resist extra pizza???  Very good karma-creator!"}
{"text":"I've been told that Hawthorne's pizza is the best in the uptown area. However, I was not impressed. There are better options for pizza in Charlotte.   It's good, just not THAT good."}
{"text":"Premium prices but not premium food. Mozzetta sticks are exactly like freezer grocery store.  Pizza is 9\" $11 and it has no \"speciality\" feel at all.      Price for food balance is not fair."}
{"text":"Been to Hawthorne's a couple of times. Full disclosure, I'm not a pizza fanatic. I like it from time to time but I don't search it out. The pizza here is good, but honestly my palette is not sophisticated enough to appreciate what everyone else is talking about. I think it's good. I go here frequently - because it's close to my house and it's decent.   That's all I have to say about that..."}
{"text":"I eat at this location about 3 times a month.  Their pizza is good but I am a huge fan of their Eggplan Rollatini and their Linguine in White Clam sauce!  Relaxed atmosphere, friendly people, good beer and wine and good food!  Check it out if you have the chance."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the experience at the \"Original\" Hawthornes.   We had the garlic knots (smothered in garlic and hot and fresh from the oven), and the Elizabeth Special (pepperoni, italian sausage, mushrooms, onion and peppers). Great beer specials and atmosphere. The food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"The pizza is as good as it's gets. The service is well above average. I haven't had a bad night there. There are more than enough beers on tap to satisfy almost anyone. And they rotate, so I'd be wasting my time telling you what's there.  This location has Tap Tv trivia. So yeah, I'm in!"}
{"text":"Hawthorne's did a great job hosting our Thursday dine in on the patio for my complex... they had a great variety of pizza... amazing garlic knots... and assorted wings ( buffalo and barbecue)   This was my first time at this new location and I the staff did a great job with taking care of everyone's needs. Thank you Hawthorne's"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch specials! The pasta is great - my favorite is the penne a la vodka. They even made it without meat for me. Very nice staff, and the food is always fresh!"}
{"text":"Hawthorne's is a great representation of NY pizza.  The dough is thin yet sturdy enough to hold all of the fresh toppings.  My favorite is the pepperoni and mushroom.  Takeout is fast and easy and there is plenty of space in the dining area.  We haven't sat in the dining room in a long long time so I cannot speak on how service is now but in the past it has been great.  If you get a chance and feel on the wild side, order the fried cheesecake for dessert.  AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"Hawthorne's Pizza is a very friendly and clean environment. Their food has an amazing taste and is very fresh. Every time that I've been the service has been excellent and professional. My personal favorite and what I'd suggest is the buffalo chicken Stromboli. The bread is fresh and fluffy while the chicken has a great taste with a slight kick. You will not be disappointed with anything you order from the menu."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in our latest trip to Hawthornes. Came in and it was sorta busy and we didn't get waited on for close to 15 mins (should of just left at that point). The nice hostess had to take our drink orders and another 10 mins passed by and the lady who was our server came by just to card my husband. Okay that's fine but she didn't take our order for yet another 10 mins. Our food took pretty long as well. I ordered a calzone that was just a pizza shell folded in half. It wasn't sealed or doughy or anything like a calzone but our waitress wasn't around for me to ask her so I ate it. Took us almost 2 hours to get out of there. I'll chalk this one up as a weird night, but not overly happy."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. The manager walks to every table and checks on them to make sure their food is great. Great service the two times I've eaten here. The pizza is great and so are their island wings. Before that my boyfriend and I had the house chips they were good too. Overall great experience and will continue getting pizza from them."}
{"text":"It's fine. I don't really understand the infatuation some people have with this place, though. Both times I have been there, the pizza seemed really soggy (like wet and floppy) and overpriced. I did like that there were a couple of booths that could seat larger groups, but they weren't very comfortable."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed but then again I think it will grow on me.  When I visited with my girlfriend the whole place was filled with kids and that doesn't and shouldn't really reflect on the restaurant but I think this place is very kid friendly (which is good) but sometimes it can be a bear for others.  I'm going to give this place more time to really put an impression in on me and see how it goes.  I like the feel of the place and the service was excellent though."}
{"text":"I'm not mad at this place. It is what it purports to be - it is a bar and does in fact serve pizza. The menu was big, but it seems a little busy.  That might explain the \"just alright\" nature of all of the food that I tried.   I enjoyed my Elizabeth Special - pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, onions, and delicious mozzarella. The crust was a tiny bit soggy, but it still held up well. My mom tackled the Greek salad, but it was too large. Fairly good, but overpowered with dressing. I sampled from the pizzas of my friends and had roughly the same experience. The combo of my flavors was better, though ;)  On the bright side, they have good table service and a good beer selection. I also liked sitting outside, even though the cafe next door allowed smoking on their patio.  We were seated quickly and got plenty of attention when needed, so no complaints there.   Since I'm not in the area often, I'm not sure I'd seek it out again, though most places deserve a second go. Stick with the pizza and beer and things should be fine."}
{"text":"Had pizza here for the first time Saturday night.  The place itself is nice, good atmosphere, good service.  The pizza I would say was unexceptional.  Crust is thin but sorta rubbery rather than crispy.  Sauce and cheese do the job but seem a little greasy and salty.  The one awesome thing was the fried eggplant topping -- very tasty.  Would I eat here again?  Probably under some circumstances.  But I wasn't excited."}
{"text":"Not my favorite pizza in Charlotte, but it holds it's own.  Crust is not a thick dough-fest and they have a mix of different kinds of specialty pies (buffalo wing pizza is memorable, in a good way) and salads that are tasty and freshly made.  The real star, for when I need a total carb overload, is the garlic knots appetizer- the perfect mix of crusty and soft bread slathered in copious quantities of minced garlic and a butter sauce.  A once in a blue moon treat 'cause my arteries clog up at the very thought of ordering even a small portion of these.  Downgrade here is that, despite a pretty large bar with the omni-present big screens, families still schlock their ill-mannered kids in here by the minivan load.  The wife and I literally left here before dinner came one Friday night because a table in the bar area was stocked with \"little darlings\" who couldn't stop the pee-wee dough-tossing contest that became distracting and downright annoying.    To his credit, the manager on duty did come out to the parking lot to inquire, but all he offered was to buy us a beer \"next time.\"  I'm all for kids being allowed out, but all I ask is that they be somewhat well-mannered and that you don't sit them in the bar area.  Giving them free pizza dough to toss around was only inviting trouble.  Restaurant owners- stick to the box of crayons and the colorable place mat, please.  Prices are a little high in comparison, but not obnoxiously so.  Big draw for warmer months is the outdoor patio.  It can get crowded on weekends, and a wait is sometimes part of the deal.  The cold beer selection only makes the experience better.  Also check out the drink specials, they're not bad if you luck up and find something that fits you palette."}
{"text":"The pizza was ok. Good environment. Terrible service. Our waiter was awful. She was so mad especially after we gave her a 20% tip. She was just shook her head and said \"is that it\" like honestly. Wouldn't recommend this place all because of this annoying waiter and bad service."}
{"text":"WOW!!!  It does not get any better than this - we had a large party of 10 of all ages  celebrating my sons birthday and Hawthornes did a superior job with customer service, food and just plain friendly.  Caitlin was our server and she was awesome!  It felt like we had our own personnel server.  Wonderful service.  As I told her as we were leaving, we usually get take out because of our age children but no need to - we felt very comfortable there and were taken care of superbly!!!!!  Delicious food.  Thanks you!"}
{"text":"Great pizza place in the Charlotte area . I was in town for business so decided to check it out because of other favorable reviews . I can't say I am a NY pizza expert, but I try a lot of pizza restaurants wherever I go and this was a great meal. I had a jalapeño and pepperoni 9inch pizza. Perfect portion (probably shouldn't have ate it all !) The price of the pizza was very reasonable to me . The wine special was a great deal a nice chianti for $5 per glass. It seemed to be family friendly, with a spot children can watch the chef up close (behind a glass) and yet many friends appeared to be meeting there for dinner as well. I would go back."}
{"text":"When I went here with my family it was kids night so Kids meals were free. We enjoyed ourselves because they had a magician and balloon artist.  However the service was a little slow. They were packed to capacity and we had to wait at least 20 minutes just to get some food. I had 2 kids with me and they were getting really antsy.   Also, SN, my youngest daughter spilled her milk on the floor. It took at least five minutes for anyone to acknowledge and bring over napkins. I had to ask for them and napkins and finally they sent someone over to mop it up.  Regarding the taste of the food, the pizza was really good. Reminds me of a Wolfman pizza a little. However I had a Stromboli as well and it was really oily and the cheese was not melted all the way through. Eeew.   I would definitely return on another kids tonight because kids eat free."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about the quality & service. We visit frequently from St. Louis where they have no idea what makes a great pie. I also had the Caprese salad, tomatoes, basil, mozzarella & balsamic vinegar. B+, not their fault, it's just not tomato season yet."}
{"text":"Does anybody in town make a thin crust pizza? The service was great, very attentive gal but I need to continue my quest to find a truly NY slice."}
{"text":"Hawthorne's is an important part of our neighborhood. They are community minded and help out when the Elizabeth neighborhood has events which is certainly important to me. I always feel welcome when I visit and usually take out something like chicken Parmesan or pizza and usually accompanied by a salad. The food is satisfactory but not extraordinary. I will continue to visit Hawthorne's when I need an Italian fix. By the way - God knows we need to support them during the Hawthorne Lane \"destruction.\" Yes, a bit hard to navigate around but there is plenty of parking in back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"What I like most about this place is the atmosphere. It's a nice hang out spot and the service at the bar is good. What I'm not crazy about is the pizza. It's OK, but there are a few pizza places in the area that are better like Big Guy's for example. If you're coming for the bar and a night out, it's a great place. If you are coming for the pizza, then you're coming for decent but not great pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent New York style pizza. The pizza had big slices, easy to order for pickup, and was piping hot   They only sell personal sized pizzas and large pizzas. Side salad was ok. But sure did make a good slice of pizza."}
{"text":"First my review is for the newest location in Harrisburg, NC. Let me start saying Harrisburg has very few restaurants.  We need more, because really Dino's is the only one that is good.  Hawthornes's will not change this fact.  It has not been open long so it has been difficult to go when there has not been lines out then door.  Usually a good sign for a restaurant...in this case not so much...like I said there are precious few places to eat in this town.  Well on our third attempt we got in on the night  of 5/1.  We were seated promptly and the staff was excellent.  Our server was prompt and took our drink order immediately.  Our family of 4 decided to order the Sicilian Deep Dish with Pepperoni and Sausage.  The Pizza was ready in the expected amount of time and looked great!  That was the last good feeling we had about Hawhorn's.  The pizza was flat out awful!!!  The pizza was lacking flavor of any kind.  We were starving so ate some...but brought most home hoping we could Dr. It up a bit to make it worth eating.  The box is in the refridge waiting To be thrown out.  I would not recommend this joint for pizza.  I can not judge any other dishes they may have.  Nice folks, good staff....can't make pizza!"}
{"text":"Finally, good pizza in Charlotte. This is a comfortable place to grab a pizza, some beers and good service. The pizza was tasty, flavorful toppings, crust that wasn't cardboard or too doughy, and awesome marinara. It beats the chains hands down as well as the local/one-off competition."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Hawthorne's.  My brother was visiting from Florida, so I made him go with me. Wings, Ranch Chicken Pizza and Elizabeth Pizza sooo good. If you are a ranch dressing freak this place has amazing ranch.  Half price wine on Sunday, bonus!  Excellent service, now I'm full and miserable :)"}
{"text":"For some reason, my boss decided that this was the place to meet new clients. Service was excellent - the waitress kept all of our glasses well filled the whole time.  House made chips and the spicy dip were great. A little greasy, but I think that's the way it's supposed to be.  Four people who didn't know each other couldn't decide on a pizza, so we let the waitress decide. She brought us a large pie (two slices each) with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. More greasiness, but it also seemed like it's supposed to be that way. The crust was really good - nice and crispy without being hard."}
{"text":"Went to the Mint Hill location for lunch today (Sunday).  I was looking forward to it since Hawthorne's always gets high marks in reviews and polls.  However, I was a litte cautious since we were going to the one in Mint HIll and not the original in Elizabeth's.  We ordered the Buffalo Chicken pizza and a New Yorker Cheese pizza and kid's chicken fingers.  The service was good.  I was not impressed with the pizza.  One thought was that the pizza was under cooked, because one side of pizza the cheese was cooked and the other side it was not cooked all the way. Though the dough seemed cooked. I think the bigger reason was more the sauce on the cheese pizza.  It that had a tin can after taste to it and it didn't taste like a homemade sauce.  Even my 10 year old didn't like the cheese pizza.  The Buffalo Chicken pizza did have a little kick to it which is surprizing since it really is hard to get spicy in Charlotte.  The negative part about the pizza was that the chicken on top was diced chicken that probably came in frozen.  I was expecting that the chicken should have been breaded and cooked at the restaurant. I liked the atmosphere of the Mint HIll location, however I will give the chain one more chance but will go to the Elizabeth location instead.   The kids did like the chicken fingers and the waffle fries.  The waffle fries were nice and crispy and had a good flavor."}
{"text":"Good beer selection and great pizza. Love their wings. Best in the hood and better than the other joints around Highland Creek. Much to choose from their menu. Great bar area and good place to watch sports. Great Highland Creek  neighborhood bar. Hawthorne has a good reputation in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I went there to watch a game.  It's not necessarily the best place to watch a game but they have several TVs at the bar so it works for us.    There was a ton of kids there so I have to say it has to be a great place for kids. I mean who doesn't love pizza.  The garlic knots are amazing. I wanted to sop up every last drop of the garlic oil that I could. The meatballs are also very good.  The pizza, of course, you can never go wrong with.  We had the Chicken Bacon ranch which was as good as it sounds.   Parking can be difficult if it is busy. there are a few spots up front and a few more in the back. otherwise you have to find a spot of the street.   Ive ordered take out before which is great. they have a couple spots out back reserved for take out and a special area for you to pick it up which makes it convenient.   I have been to 3 of the 5 Hawthorne's locations and what is great about them is that they are consistent across all the restaurants in terms of taste and quality.  That's hard to get when you have several locations."}
{"text":"Hawthorne's has several locations and what is great is the taste and quality is very consistent across them all from what I have seen and tasted.  It was during the week and I happen to be in the area and was craving their penne Ala vodka. So I called in an order to go.  It was ready in just 15 mins. Came with two slices of  fresh hot Italian bread. Um mm heaven."}
{"text":"First off the food was awesome.  I got the garlic knots and a calzone with a side salad. Service was great as well. The only reason not a 5 star? Its a pizza joint...if I could I would've given 4.5 *s. My only complaint isn't against the establishment,  but to the parents who allow their children to run around in public like deranged banshees. Seriously!  If I EVER thought to act that way in public I wouldn't jave been able to sit for a week! But overall I'm sure I'll be back...just not order soo much food."}
{"text":"The service was pretty good. They came and checked on me frequently and they were nice.  I ordered the 9inc pizza. I had pepperoni sausage and pineapple.  I then had the island style Jumbo wings and they were very good! I would put them up there with BWW's if you know what I mean.  Was it the best pizza. No but it wasnt far from it. If you just desire some fresh pizza I would recommend it.  One thing I didn't like was the large pipe/vent kept rumbling and swaying back and forth on the ceiling which made me a bit nervous!"}
{"text":"This review today is brought to you by Hawthorne's garlic knots.  Buttery, garlicy, fantastically delicious garlic knots.  And hey, their pizza's not bad either!  After two visits, I can safely add this to my list of go-to pizza places.  I have lived close to Hawthorne's and driven by it many, many times, and for the life of me, I don't know why I have never stopped in.  I suppose it was fear of being disappointed by sub-par pizza, but my fear was definitely unfounded.  A friend suggested we meet here for lunch one day, and so I showed up.  She had never eaten here, but she told me she'd had their garlic knots before.  She decided to order some, and I got to have one.  They looked and smelled fantastic, completely dowsed in butter and oil, an explosion of garlic everywhere, and some herbs thrown in for good measure.  I can safely say these are the most magical (and probably unhealthy) garlic knots I have eaten.  And normally, I don't care for the marinara sauce served with the bread.  However, I loved Hawthorne's!  It is the perfect balance of sweet and flavorful, with chunks of tomatoes in the sauce.  Yum!  I also tried a couple different types of pizza.  I had the Greek pizza, with kalamata olives, tomatoes, feta, and onions.  I loved it.  Their Elizabeth special is like a supreme pizza, and it was also very good.  The crust is not necessarily full of flavor, but it has a great chewy texture traditional of hand tossed pizza.  The sauce tasted the same as the marinara dipping sauce (it may have been thicker).  One thing I appreciate is that Hawthorne's does not skimp on the toppings, especially the cheese.  In addition to pizza and garlic knots, they have a pretty large menu with other appetizers, pasta, sandwiches, and even calzones, not to mention the plethora of salads offered on their menu.  Hand tossed pizzas come in either 9\" or 18\", but they don't have one in between.  They also offer a Sicilian pizza for an extra cost, but I did not get to see how big that was.  Pizza prices are about standard for Charlotte, about $8-10 for the small pizza and about $14-$19 for the large pizzas.    Dining in, the service was pretty good.  The staff was friendly and helpful when we were there.  The first time I got carry out, I didn't realize they had a separate area for that.  The carry out area is on the side, facing Hawthorne Street.  As far as parking, they do have a pretty decent amount.  They have a small lot in the front with just a few spaces, but they have a larger lot behind the building.  I will definitely keep coming back, especially for those garlic knots.  If you order them, just be prepared with breath mints and Tums."}
{"text":"Good Pizza, good drink specials.  Pretty typical for a Pizza Place.  If you are looking for a good place to go with the family or some friends for Pizza you could definitely do worse than this place."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great patio and great service! The pizzas are insanely huge (in the voice of Donald Trump) you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte. Reminds me of New York, Boston style pizza. Nice huge slices. Took me 2 years to find a pizza place that deserves repeat business. I just wish they delivered. Staff is very down to earth."}
{"text":"Love Hawthorne's, and am so glad they're part of the MoRA area. Admittedly, they bit of a tough start, but have worked out the kinks and are now an awesome place to go for good food and good drinks.  We will often stop by late, or grab take-out, and enjoy some of their delicious traditional Italian dishes and fabulous pizza. I especially like that you can change up the normal ingredients if you prefer, and they are totally happy to make you anything as long as they have the ingredients. (I love angel hair with most everything, so when I get the Chicken Marsala or other dishes that come standard with the yummy potatoes, I can get pasta and make my mouth extra happy.) The wings are yummy too. Try them extra crispy with the Long Island sauce...your tastebuds will thank you.  Oh yeah, there are drink specials too, with, about 15 taps of mostly local brews. That's a win in my book."}
{"text":"Great New York style thin crust pizza!! We been going there for years! Service is great and And many of the staff have worked there for years. Haven't had any food there that I didn't like! :-)"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Hawthorne's and will return soon.  Pizza was very good and so was the service by Sam.  Place was clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"We grabbed dinner here not too long ago, and while I went in not expecting very much, I left pleasantly surprised. It's not fancy restaurant or anything by any means, but it's not trying to be, and what they offer up is actually really good and really inexpensive.   Now I'm a New Yorker, so I'm not really sure what about this place qualifies as \"NY Pizza,\" but it's pretty good stuff for the most part. I grabbed a personal pizza as entree, which was just the right size--you can finish it and not feel completely ill for the rest of the night. Mine has roasted sun dried tomatoes and garlic on it. Very enjoyable. I also had a salad, which was much bigger than expected and also super tasty and fresh. They have lots of beers and even some wine, so you can really get a full meal here if you want.   This place was pretty bumpin' for a random wednesday night, so apparently the secret is out: great place for a casual meal or beer. They have outdoor seating too, which is super nice."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted. On one hand, I'm just happy to have another option for lunch near my office. (I work on Idlewild Road, in the food desert that is the 74-corridor.) On the other hand, my first experience at Hawthorne's was pretty average.   I went with a medium-sized group from the office and was impressed with the service. Two staff waited on our party of 12 people. My drink glass was always full, orders were taken right away, food came out in a timely fashion and our checks were delivered/credit cards run quickly.   Unfortunately, the food wasn't anything to write home about. I ordered the Gorgonzola Salad with grilled chicken. It was fine... mixed greens, topped with candied nuts, red onion, a couple cherry tomatoes, and gorgonzola cheese. The raspberry vinaigrette thankfully came on the side as it was super sweet and too much (I used about half the little container) could have really overpowered the whole thing. So, all in all, edible but nothing special. When my check arrived and I realized that a Diet Coke and salad rang up to $16 though, I almost fell out of my chair. For $16 at lunch, this should have been the most amazing salad ever. I think next time I'll stick with their pizza.   I'll try this location again because they're just so darn close to the office but hope to maybe pick a better tasting and better priced menu item next time."}
{"text":"As far as Mint Hill goes, Hawthorne's is the place! There are many pizza places popping up all over Charlotte, but it is great to have this place in Mint Hill. This place gets packed so I like to go a little earlier (right out of work) and settle into into a nice spot. On nice days I like to grab a spot on the patio. I have almost tried all of their specialty pizzas- they are all good, but my personal favorite is the buffalo chicken pizza. They also have great wings with different flavors like sweet and sour and teriyaki. However, no classic flavors like hot, medium, or mild. Servers and bar tenders are all friendly. However, we have had to wait for a long time for our orders to be taken and sometimes we never see our server again after the food is dropped off. All in all, good food and friendly service- a great place to hang out in Mint Hill."}
{"text":"The name of Hawthorne's suits it well! The pizza certainly does taste like its straight from NY! We have ordered from here numerous times, but have never gone in to sit down and eat. But we have always been pleasantly surprised with the ordering out. It can tend to be a bit pricy for what you get which is the only reason I rated it as 4 stars instead of 5. We also ordered meals one time and being from NY you are used to spending about 15$ on a pasta meal but they usually come with a decent amount of bread and salad which it does not come with at Hawthornes. And the serving size of the pasta dishes was VERY small. We ordered 4 entrees and it was barely enough to feed 4 of us which was disappointing, but the food itself was really good. I will definitely continue ordering pizza from Hawthornes and would like to come in and dine in soon to see if its any different than ordering entrees out. Overall, really good experiences and really enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Staff is extremely friendly and the food is consistently great! I am from NY and it's not often you find pizza and Italian food that is comparable."}
{"text":"Had my daughter's 1st birthday there & it was amazing! Shirley was the manager on duty & she was very attentive & Jenny our server did an awesome job! Jenny even gave my little girl a my little pony plush toy. The food & the staff were perfect. You should make this place a regular spot like we will!"}
{"text":"Great unique spot in Mint Hill.  As all things in/near Charlotte, things have really grown in the past 10 years.  This pizza/restaurant seemed to pop up out of nowhere, but it's good to see a place like this in the community.  Went early on a Friday evening (before it got crowded) and enjoyed a Hawthorne's salad and split a Hawthorne's Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza.  Perfect amount of food for 2 people that weren't exceptionally hungry.  But the salad hit the right note especially the yummy mandarin oranges and pecans nestled inside the greens.  It wasn't over dressed (as many places tend to drench salads) and a good size.  Pizza was good..... I could have wanted more toppings, but it seemed to strike the right balance of toppings, cheese, and crust.  The only negatives I would have to say is the parking (in the back) but it was just getting busy as we were leaving on a Friday and the lot was already packed.  It also doesn't help that there is one way in and out and people started parking on the side of the street.  Like previously mentioned, there is no signage indicating Hawthorne's until you are right on top of it, (or passed)... but it doesn't look like this place is going anywhere anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the \"neighborhood pizza place\" of which Hawthorne's fits the bill perfectly.  I know they have several locations in the Charlotte area, but Charlotte also has a lot of neighborhoods to keep happy (and the neighborhoods keep growing it seems).  All the construction on Hawthorne Ln with the bridge removal has probably made it super hard for this location, but they recently opened the street back up so it feels like there's a light at the end of the tunnel.  They have more than just pizza here!  Salads, pastas, and sandwiches... the food definitely shines here.  Probably my favorite thing is watching little kids climb up the staircase so they can watch the pizza makers toss the dough and they even get some of their own to be interactive.  TVs surround the walls so probably not a bad spot to watch a game or event.  Though, I do have to note that it was a slow event day since one of the TVs had a professional corn hole tournament on it.  The staff are always friendly, I can see the place getting super busy so you just have to be patient sometimes.  A neighborhood pizza place is definitely to be enjoyed, not rushed!  Relax with the beers on tap.  I had a local brew from Legion just for the Elizabeth 8k to where Hawthorne's is one of the sponsors for the race."}
{"text":"This is the real NY style pizza, we added ham and pineapple and it was just perfect, so delicious.  Very kid friendly.  The place was packed when we went and the wait was super short! Very fast service, very friendly servers.   We also had the mozzarella sticks, they were ok, we are sticking to the pizza, so perfect."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch on a weekend & while it's above average in the food department, it's still nothing I'd specifically travel to to eat if I weren't close by. I  haven't had the pizza so go ahead & blast me for not trying their signature food. I've heard it's pretty good but I obviously can't speak to it. As for the atmosphere of the place, they have a good sports bar type feel. There are plenty of TVs & a good sized bar area. Also, there's a large patio area with plenty of seating on a nice spring day to grab some food or drink."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I got off work early and met at Hawthorne's Meridian Place on Monroe Rd.  Easy to find, but they should put a sign on the side and/or back for better Monroe Rd visibility.  This location isn't visible from Independence as far as I can tell so good signage will be important.  Staff were mid-shift and there was some training going on and a staff meeting as well but the bartender took good care of us, and a few other bar patrons.  Restaurant was fairly empty, but  it was an odd time of day we were there.  They do have a half-price wine day, but it wasn't the day we were there so ask about that.    Spicy fried shrimp were good and served with a portion of slaw.  Smaller portion.  Spinach dip with crispy, soft bread with light olive oil.   A lot of spinach and great, fresh flavor.  Not salty which can happen, so A+ on that!  A nice prosecco rounded out our apps.  I would definitely go again based on my first experience there!"}
{"text":"I've been pining for a replacement for Wolfman's on Providence, but sadly, Hawthorne's isn't it.  It's a nice restaurant with a good patio.  The Double Cheese, Sausage & Onion pizza just didn't hit the spot for me.  The crust was disappointingly floppy, with no crisp to it & it was a thin crust.  Even the crust edge was just meh.  The chicken wings were nice and crispy, but again - not my favorites in town. They brought out some special barbeque sauce for my sweetie to dip the wings into and that sauce was really, really good.  Dark, smoky, delish.  The did have Great Lakes beer & I had a witbier with spices & chamomile & I really liked that.  It was different, only slightly fruity, not super sweet - It was the chamomile, but I don't know exactly how to describe the taste, but if you're open for new flavors - give it a try!  So, I'd go back, but probably just to hang out, not specifically for the pizza or wings."}
{"text":"I'm really digging the new location, it's closer to where I live so great. I've been here 3 times or so since it opened. I've tried something different each time, I got the turkey club the other day, had a issue with the bread, Brian was really sweet and understanding and offered to make it right. But I took my chances any way and took it home, well I'll never get it again and that's not because of the bread. The turkey was slimy, didn't seem like deli turkey at all. Well not that I'm use to any way. It's like the turkey on the lunchables that you buy for your kid from the grocery store. Very slimy and small, no other way to explain that but gross. The waffle fries on the other hand were amazing. The best part of the 11.95 meal, so needless to say the club was less than meh. But the restaurant is very nice, friendly staff. So I'll be back, just not for the turkey."}
{"text":"We got a large pepperoni take out today and it was disgusting.   It was swimming in grease- more grease than I have ever seen on a pizza.  My teenage son loves pizza but he pronounced it \"gross\" and after one slice refused to eat any more.   He made himself microwave ramen instead.   My family unanimously said \"Dad, don't get pizza from this place again.\"   Don't worry, I won't."}
{"text":"8/16/13  Great pizza place in sister's neighborhood!    My first visit here was a day shy of two years ago- I found a pic on my laptop of a Margherita pizza from here dated 8/17/11.  I remember thinking the pizza and calamari were great, and my spaghetti-loving sister enjoyed her selection, as well...  Tonight, we ordered drafts of YuengLing (BIL) and Honey Brown (moi), a bottle of Corona (with a lime wedge; sis), and waters all around.  Our server Blair was kind enough to let me sample the Waterkeeper Hefeweizen (one of two specials on tap) and the HB http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=XQX6OCUnFv9MacOAbwS-EQ#XQX6OCUnFv9MacOAbwS-EQ before I ordered a pint.  BIL ordered the other draft special, Dale's pale ale, but he didn't like it, so sis asked if he could switch it out for another.  No prob.  For food, we chose the calamari to start, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=69xy3Q3NjSUTRomDOgDj4w#69xy3Q3NjSUTRomDOgDj4w and an 18\" half-Elizabeth Special and half-Hawthorne's Special White, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=1kmEdfAxtM0pjzYTyJHDMQ#1kmEdfAxtM0pjzYTyJHDMQ while nephew wanted the cheese pizza. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=lJE9Ugy6CD9wFH-b92flcg#lJE9Ugy6CD9wFH-b92flcg  While I can't speak for my sister and BIL's usual pizza pick (Italian sausage, pepperoni, 'shrooms, green bell, white onions, mozz), sister and I LOVED the HSW, which had ricotta cream sauce, mozz, (lotsa!) pesto, and sundried tomatoes.  I really appreciated the thin crusts served here. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=iSE_JGbw3nZ0Ks3CXN60Cg#iSE_JGbw3nZ0Ks3CXN60Cg  Sister already decided this combo is what they're ordering on their next visit.  A great meal out almost always ends with something sweet, and I love tiramisu, so this was a must-try. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=xGX1CO0Jfnq4qwe_WitiYg#xGX1CO0Jfnq4qwe_WitiYg  Sis ordered a slice of chocolate cake for my nephew. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=fIgdOPFPCcLTquIoSyJzGQ#fIgdOPFPCcLTquIoSyJzGQ  They were BOTH absolutely amazing!  I like tiramisu that is rich in flavor-sweet mascarpone, but not cloyingly so, and rich espresso taste, no greasy mouth-feel, and not too light and fluffy, and this was perfect!  (I asked for the powdered sugar to be omitted.)  The chocolate cake is also a must-have!  It was a lot denser than the tiramisu-- almost flourless in texture, or at least the part I ate from was (the outer edge of the cake).  Too bad the busser threw out our take-out containers of sweet treats... They're pricey!  (Tiramisu was almost $6, and the chocolate cake was $8, but come to think of it, the cake slice was huge.)  I even labeled and dated them, but not even two minutes had passed when I thought I'd forgotten my phone and ran in to retrieve it, and our table had already been cleared, and the busser didn't even bat an eye.  We didn't notice that the desserts were missing until we were home.    Make sure you check the tab for accuracy!!  p.s.  The Honey Brown lived up to its name, and I definitely preferred it after sampling the bitter hef, but the beer kept impressing me as I ate the calamari (awesome combo) and then progressed to the pizza.  I had my sister try the beer after each course, and she concurred.  I would order this again in the future!"}
{"text":"Legitimately good pizza. (As said by a couple of New Yorkers, for what it's worth. Not to be flauntin' pizza cred, but we know what we're talking about on this one!) We generally eat here at least 4-5 times a month, and the pizza is always our go-to. The pasta dishes tend to be so-so - I've ordered the spinach portabella pasta on multiple occasions and it unfortunately always misses the mark for me...really oily sauce that separates almost immediately, so 5 minutes you're eating noodles in a heavy, oily soup. But the vodka penne is good.Calzones are pretty solid too!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and there's not really anything else like it in Mint Hill so it makes sense why its always pretty crowded.  Food has been good and have tried pizza, pasta and even a sandwich.  Service has been only ok though.  The kitchen is always incredibly loud though with the staff talking and laughing.  Usually its crowded so its not bad but even when its slow its still incredibly loud back there."}
{"text":"Pretty bad last Saturday just for a bowl of spaghetti for my granddaughter and I. We felt like we didn't matter. Too much fooling around going on in the kitchen you could hear it. We wound up being the last dining people in there and the waitress basically forgot about us. Took too long for everything she did.   Seems like the customer service has gone to ---- And people here really do not care.   Asked for a booth to start and say is in a chair with a half booth. I asked for a real booth no response.   As usual when you ask for pats of butter for your spaghetti sauce they bring a little cup of melted butter which really is oil.   Sad."}
{"text":"Just moved to Highland Creek and was VERY happy to find Hawthorne's is our local pizza joint. Pizza is delicious, reminds me of typical NY pizza. Vibe is pretty straightforward sports bar, but very family friendly and overall laid back. $1.50 drafts on Mondays and $2 and change other nights, can't beat it. The Hawthorne salad is delicious and I've had the sausage and pepperoni calzone that was also amazing. Haven't gotten any farther on the menu yet.   For what it is, a neighborhood-family-pizza place where the moms and dads can also have a drink, it gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome food .... Kids eat free Tuesday's and they get a balloon artist to create a balloon of their choice.  It's the best time for family time !!!"}
{"text":"Pizzas are all good every time I've got them. Sicilian is especially good. Spaghetti is average. Lasagna has carrots and celery in it...Seriously, who does that? And tomato sauce in it is over salted. Ambiance of this joint leaves some to be desired. It's great if you just want some quality pizza."}
{"text":"It had been such a long time since I went to Hawthorne's. I used to work in University City and had been to that one a couple of times but I happen to find myself in uptown, and hungry, so this was a welcomed sight. The pizzas at here are absolutely amazing, one of my favorites being the barbecue. But I was visiting a friend in the hospital down the street and needed something more comforting. For an appetizer, we got the House chips. OMG! These things are sooo good and they aren't cut too thin, which is a pet peeve of mine. It's served with a sauce that seems like mayo and hot sauce which is damn good. (I'll have to figure this out so I can use it at home) I ordered the lasagna. I'm a fan of the lasagna, but please note...it's made with sausage. Kinda like the sausage crumbles you would get on a pizza made with sausage. It's goo though! It's served with 2 garlic toast wedges, but if you need a sauce sopping apparatus, order the garlic knots...they do not disappoint. There's also a separate to go entrance and an amazing patio that I have yet to use. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Overall a very great experience. Very good service and food was overall decent.   Started with the meatballs - they're fantastic. Not that I've tried most things on the menu, but this has to be one of the best things on the menu. The parmesan really comes through - I'd love to have the recipe for the mix. They're a must have.   Hawthornes is currently doing a corned beef fest for St Pattys, which brought me there (currently trying all the Reubens in Charlotte on a Reuben adventure, this makes 32). They added a Reuben to their menu and also have a Reuben pizza.   I'll start with the Reuben. Very mediocre. Marbled rye that wasn't crisped, sub par corned beef, almost no cheese, standard kraut from a bag. It wasn't a bad reuben, just nothing at all about it stood out. I'd say not worth venturing out to try during their special.   Onto the pizza - it was good, but I expected more Reuben flavors. I've had the pizza from Hawthornes before (they have one that has meatballs on, recommend that), and it is very good pizza. But the Reuben ingredients weren't done in the best way. Only a little bit of corned beef and a very thin layer of the thousand island sauce - nothing like their picture. I couldn't taste any Swiss which I feel is essential for a Reuben pizza (I don't think they added any). It was overall an enjoyable experience, but probably not worth the price tag on the large pizza ($23)."}
{"text":"The food is actually not bad at all. The reason for the poor rating is that the place is way over priced. It's $10 for a chicken sandwich and the cheapest thing on the kids menu is $6. Really?    The location is in an out of the way shopping center near Highland Creek. About the furthest thing imaginable from a high rent district. They need to do a little research of comparable establishments in the area (e.g. Pippa's Cafe, Johnny Brusco's, Afton Pizza etc.) and they'd quickly see the discrepancy."}
{"text":"Hawthorne's is really tough to pin down.  On one hand you have the food.  I actually quite like the pizza at this location (I've also been to another location and wasn't impressed).  The crust is crisp on the outside while the inside is light and chewy.  Nice.  The sauce is tasty and the toppings mingle nicely.  We did go for carnivorous pizza, however, so I can't really speak to veggie options.  The meat, however, didn't have a bunch of flavor - I'd suggest something like The Crew pizza, where you get meat and banana peppers.  The flavors really blended well together.  Just getting meat didn't really bring out the flavors as well, however.  Atmosphere in the place is nice, and much better than the cramped interior of the 7th/Monroe/Hawthorne location.  I'd also concur that they can get packed at times - especially nights.  Definitely be aware that this place is tough to find if you don't know where you are going, or if you are trying to give people directions.  Signage is almost non-existent.  For that reason, GPS may come in handy.  Staff is very helpful, and at least when we were there, kept glasses full (however, we were their only table!).  I would also agree that they can get pricey.  Their personal pizza is a good size for one person, but at $9, it doesn't really seem like that great of a value.  If you go to Big Guy's down the street, you can get a single slice that is about that size for half the price, or you can go to Little Caesar's and get an entire pizza that is larger for just more than half the price.  Is either as good?  Probably not.  But if you're feeding the kids and want to keep the price down, it might be important.  Sweet Tea Report: Not too sweet, but very drinkable.  I personally prefer a bit more sweetness (okay, syrup-like would be good).  But this goes down really easily, so it's a good match with their pie.  Very high up on the list."}
{"text":"The selling point of Hawthorne's is easily the patio.  It's a nice seating area outside that has to be equal to, or perhaps even larger than, the interior space.  The downfall is that the parking is almost non-existent, so it's really only useful if you're in walking distance or have time to figure out where to park.  Once you do get a place to park (and eventually sit), service isn't bad at all - or wasn't when we were there, even though they were fairly well packed in at the time.  It was interesting that when we arrived the tables were just about full, but by the time we left they were almost empty, which seems to indicate that it may be a short-lived rush.  As to the food: It's acceptable, but nothing fancy.  There is plenty that is both better and worse.  We tried the individual pizzas, and were able to watch them prepare it at the open-air kitchen area (perhaps not ours specifically, but something).  The wait wasn't bad, even though they were full when we arrived."}
{"text":"I am not sure how to reply to your message directly John. Anyways, we came on February 24th at about 9:30/10. The bartender was a blonde woman."}
{"text":"What a great find. Tiffany was our server & so very attentive.  Had a late lunch on Saturday & we all had pizza but agreed we would try something else next time. We are moving to the Charlotte area soon & Hawthorn ' s is close to our new neighborhood.  We'll definitely be back #"}
{"text":"Ah, this is good pizza... Pizza pizza!! I love how generous they get with their toppings. The pizza is huge, dough is fresh, as are the toppings. The only pizza I'm not a fan of here is the Buffalo Wings, but I've liked almost all other pizzas that I've tried here. My all time favorite is the Elizabeth Special. I never fail to order that, even if it has to be just one half. The other pizzas I would recommend are the Hawthorne's Special White, Meat Eaters, Crew and Ultimate Spinach. Their seating is pretty nice, the two times that I have dined in, we sat on the patio, which can get chilly on a cool day with the wind blowing, but is really nice on a warm summers day, especially if you have beer to go with it... Pizza and beer on a warm night, you can't go wrong with that! I like that they have a separate entrance for take-out because we usually just take our pizza to go and it's nice to have a little quiet seating while we wait on our pizza. They also have a couple game machines, although I've never actually tried them out. Parking is limited, but they recently added some extra parking spaces so it's better."}
{"text":"We have been going to Hawthorne's for quite some time now. We used to go to the original one on Hawthorne Ln in Plaza Midwood when we lived down there and never got anything but pizza. Now we live 7 min from this one and have never had the pizza, haha! My favorite thing here is the chicken parm. It's absolutely the best chicken parm I've had. Their caprese salad is really good too, as well as the garlic knots. The chocolate lava cake though, is TO DIE FOR. There will be times in the future when I go here on a full stomach just to get one of those. Trust me, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Tonight was the loudest dining experience I have ever endured at this location. We were literally yelling across the booth to each other. Quick seating and quick food delivery. It was literally uncomfortable with the volume level. We did enjoy 2 kids pizzas and drinks for 4 \"and 1 beer\" and a side salad and fries for 40 bucks. Hence as a 15 year mint hill resident for my low visitation."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and was surprised at how slow it was. Must of been because of Restaurant Week. We didn't have trouble at all with parking. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who sat us right away. I was here with a party of 4.   We got 12 garlic knots and was so surprised at how large the knots were. Huge! Like fist size. They were drizzled with garlic and butter. It was honestly one of the best garlic knots that I have ever had! Marinara sauce that came with it was delicious. You can tell it was homemade which I like! We also got the chili cheese dip. It came tortilla chips. It was a large portion. Had onions and sour cream on top too! If we would of known how large the garlic knots were, we definitely wouldn't of gotten this.   We ended up getting two large pizzas. One was half elizabeth (supreme) and half meat. The other was half chicken buffalo and half chicken pesto. They were all good!! My favorite was the meat. We also took out the italian sausage and subbed it with meatball and I'm glad we made that decision. Their meatball is so tender and flavorful. Both pizzas had a lot of toppings on it. You couldn't barely see a spot of cheese on it. Pizzas had the right amount of crusts too!   I knocked down one star because our server wasn't that attentive. I asked for a sweet tea and there were maybe 4 ice cubes in it. It was so hot I had to ask for a glass of ice. The guys got beers that were on special and they were not discounted on the check so we had to ask for the discount. We asked for more chips because we had so much dip left and she never brought it out. We had to ask for it again and that was towards the end of our meal. We wanted boxes for our pizza and garlic knots and she only boxed the pizzas. We had to ask her to box our garlic knots, it's not like there was 1 left, there were 5 left. She didn't ask us how we wanted the checks and just assumed it was 1 ticket. We told her that it was separate (there were only 4 of us so it would only be 2 checks, one for each couple). Then she told us that she was gonna just split it completely in half. We asked her if we could split it by what we paid for because some people got drinks and some didn't and the pizzas were a different price as well as the appetizers. She made it seem like it was a chore for us but to me that's pretty standard."}
{"text":"We love the fact that Hawthorne's is serving burgers now-- and they are great! We like the atmosphere and service, but had been choosing not to come here because we don't like to eat pasta very often. They have wonderful pizza here, but we like burgers!"}
{"text":"We were craving bar food one night and came to Hawthorne's and it definitely hit the spot. We shared 14 wings, 2 orders of fries, an order of mozzarella sticks. Everything was well made, we were able to order all flats for $1 extra. Our first order of wings came out mixed and we mentioned it to our waiter. Our plate was whisked away quickly and we were given new wings, all flats, promptly. He apologized right away and did not blame the kitchen for making a mistake. He handled the issue very well. Much better than I would have expected! I was willing to just keep the wings mixed at that point because we were so hungry. Overall, we spent about $40 for our food plus 1 beer. I would come back again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Local feel and good food.  Ask for the pasta primavera-it's stacked with crisp veggies and just right.  They give pizza dough to the kids as a time-killer which makes it easier to hang on busy nights."}
{"text":"Hawthorne's NY Pizza & Bar is a cozy spot in the Elizabeth neighborhood area of Charlotte, about a 5 minute drive from uptown (and work).   Keep in mind the name of the restaurant: 'Hawthorne's NY Pizza & Bar.' As far as both of these functions, this establishment has never let me down. The pizza is fresh, delicious, and the right consistency (thin but not papery). Also, I like how the sauce is still saucy and not stuck to the dough. I normally get the veggie but sometimes get the pepperoni mushroom as well!  Also, as a bar, the place has pretty decent prices for drafts all week long. I will re-update with official prices when I get a chance, but the selling point is definitely the pizza. With that said, DO NOT venture and try their other italian offerings (ravioli, subs, etc), as they pale in comparison.   In response to some of the negative reviews on this site, I just want to remind you to stay the course (NY Pizza & Bar) and you too will love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm still on my plight for the best pizza in Charlotte, and while I'm not ready to officially crown Hawthorne's as my pizza king, they still dole out some pretty sweet slices.   Hawthorne's is a fairly straight forward pizza join - there are two areas, one large dining room and one more \"bar-ish\" area with plenty of high top tables. Hubs and I usually grab a seat in the latter as there can be lots 'o kiddos running around in the main dining area (depending on the day, of course). The service is quick and friendly and they have a decent beer list to accompany their 'za.  If I'm super hungry I'll usually start off with the Garlic Cheese Bread - exactly what you would think: a hefty portion of toasted French bread, smothered in a multitude of cheeses and garlic and served with a very tasty marinara. Truth - sometimes I just prefer to make this my meal with a small side salad. But...if I'm ordering pizza, I'm a fan of their veggie as well as their white pizza. I do, however, feel the need to blot that sucker every time it comes out. But hey - that seems normal, right?  Thanks to Hawthorne's I can grab a tasty slice at lunch or hang out for a while and take down a multitude of cheesy goodness."}
{"text":"If you don't expect gourmet food then this might be a good choice. Big portions so you'll leave full Lots of choices. Beer wine lots of tvs My side salad was big. The antipasto salad had nice slices of mozzarella  The sausage and pepper appetizer was big enough for a meal Calzone was hot and full of meat and cheese  The kids loved the Mac and cheese and pizza  The chicken piccata that I got had a sauce that was more like gravy than a true piccata sauce. I won't get that again  Our service was spot on.  Nice place for family dinner. My busy grandkids were no problem for this place  I really like the outside seating. I'll be back"}
{"text":"$74 including tip, one cheese pizza that had onions, green peppers, pepperoni and sausage on it, and one bottle of wine for $34. With the tip it was over $70. The pizza was terrible. Thankfully, the service was somewhat good. And we tipped 20% ; but 70 plus dollars for one pizza and one bottle of wine, ridiculous. We will never be back. Total rip off. Very, very disappointed and feeling ripped off.  DO NOT GO THERE!"}
{"text":"Garlic knots, possibly the best possible carb in existence.  I primarily do take out from here because it's so easy to order and pay online. They also have a mobile app. There's even a super convenient take out door that's completely separate from the restaurant. You know what that means, your girl is picking up her food in sweatpants.  App-wise, we always order the chili queso dip. It may sound odd to get at an Italian place, but it's delicious. My go to pizza here is the Elizabeth Special (Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Mushrooms, Bell Peppers, White Onions) and I always add jalapenos. I also like their Penne Spinach Portabella. I love the spicy gorgonzola sauce and the drizzled balsamic on top. Right now, my current obsession is their Philly Cheesesteak. Anything smothered in melty cheese and chipotle mayo wins in my book.   Kids eat free on Tuesdays, half price bottles of wine on Sundays. They also have a gluten free menu."}
{"text":"I visit this Hawthornes about twice a month. Not sure why I have not ordered their wings before  but did tonight and they are AWESOME!! perfect combination of savory sauce, crunchy outside and juicy meat in a jumbo wing. I will be getting them again. The Long Island flavor was sweet with a kick. Yummy! My other favorites are the gorganzola salad, elizabeth pizza and chicken picatta. Staff is always great!  Update!! New decor looks great! Had the chicken parm sub tonight. Delicious!!! Diane is always a great waitress. I love how she knows and greats everyone that walks in the door."}
{"text":"The best chicken parm in N Charlotte. My wife was also very impressed with the delicious food. Our server Rich was a rock star!!"}
{"text":"What can I say. Hawthornes is one of the best pizza places around. I usually get the buffalo chicken pizza, but decided to switch it up recently and got The Crew. Both pizzas are amazing and really leave you satisfied. Every location I've been to has been pleasant and full of TVs for the sports or news watcher. I highly recommend giving your local Hawthornes a shot!"}
{"text":"I was having family come visit from out of state and ordered pizza on my way home from work. They said it would take 30 mins, and when I got there, they didn't even have an order put in for me. They kept insisting that I had called the wrong number and that my order was probably at another location. No. It wasn't. I called the same number that I called last time I placed an order here. I even confirmed the number that I called by looking at the number on their cards. I also asked her to look for my order using my phone number. She said she would and 5 minutes later, says she couldn't find it. HELLO?! You didn't even ask for my number!! The manager then comes up and says the phone number isn't even on the tickets, that they're by name. So why bother asking for a phone number anyway?  I mean seriously. After going through this whole ordeal, I ask the girl how long it would take if I made the order now. She said 10-15 mins.. 10 minutes later, she STILL hadn't put my order in. It's not hard, I just wanted a cheese and peperoni pizza. The manager offered me 50% off and I took it. I'm still not happy about it. A discount doesn't compensate for your incompetent workers who can't even put an order in. So here I am, still waiting for my pizza, and I'm furious to say the least. I will not be returning. Ever.  BTW, I've been here for an hour waiting for two pizzas."}
{"text":"Had an office lunch here, tried the tomato and mozzarella salad. Amaze!!! Parking was plentiful and lunch specials go until 3. Only weird thing is they have soup listed on their specials sign and our waitress told us they stopped serving that over a month ago. Um......."}
{"text":"Pizza was great for an afternoon bite.  If you order a large pizza, you can get a half-and-half of two types of pizza, which is great!  I like the buffalo chicken pizza, but the other toppings are great as well.    The service is probably my only negative comment.  We had to go on a search for our own utensils after asking and waiting on some for a full 5 minutes while our pizza was getting cold...  Otherwise, great pizza place in CLT!  Take-out is also great!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to go here since trying them at a Hounds game. Had a need for NY style pizza and off we went.  I was happy we went.  We had an 18\" pie which give you 8 big slices to fold over and eat.  My son had the Mac and Cheese and said it didn't look like the kind I make out of a box but that it tasted good.   The sever was very friendly as were the guys making the pizza.  They have a little stage that the kids can walk up on and look through the glass at them making pizza.  Looked like they enjoyed playing with the kids while tossing the dough.  If you can get their early or just at the right time I recommend eating outside as it is a very relaxed atmosphere.  Only complaint is parking is tight.  A small lot up front, but after 5 there is parking around the side/rear, just obey the signs posted as one business doesn't let you park at anytime for anyone but them."}
{"text":"Have tried this place a few times and I'm done eating here. Good service but the food is lousy.  Had the fettuccini Alfredo this time and not impressed.  It was greasy and bland. They used to have incredible \"Bold and Tangy\" wings that were jumbo sized. They've changed the name to \"Long Island Style\" and substituted smaller wings while keeping the \"jumbo\" name. Big mistake.  If you want good wings less than a mile away is Dunwellz and their wings are much better. On the plus side Hawthornes has the nicest bar in Mint Hill and the appetizers are pretty good."}
{"text":"Decided to have my birthday party here and it was a terrible decision. I had a group of 25-30 people and only 1 server to serve us all. Poor guy was running like crazy and the Mgr was just rude. I told her we should have more than 1 server and she said the party room only ever gets 1 server. After my order was wrong, a little girl didn't get her food till almost everyone was done eating, people needed refills that they had to wait for....and the best part is 1 person from my group ordered a pepperoni pizza with mushrooms. They brought her just a pepperoni pizza so she told the server it was wrong. He took it back and the cook chopped up some raw mushrooms and tossed them on top of her pizza!!!! She refused it a second time and then the decided it actually cook it the right way. When the Mgr was told about it she responded saying \"I knew they did that!\" I will not only never have a group party there again but I will never return there. the manager not caring is what set me off. DO NOT COME HERE TO HAVE ANY KIND OF GROUP PARTY!!!!"}
{"text":"Customer Service!   Above and beyond and out of sight.  Went here with my family for my birthday - a group of five. Everything was friendly and fast as it should be: we were seated, friendly server took our drink orders, place was clean, nice atmosphere, etc. etc. etc., all you'd expect from a well-run place. The five of us ordered the small pizzas. Soon they came out and looked beautiful. Looking at my buffalo chicken pizza and noticed that it was without the chicken! OOPS! So alerted the server - he was very apologetic, took the pizza back to the kitchen and promptly returned letting me know that the kitchen was fixing the mistake. No problem.   Then the kitchen manager (I assume) came out to personally let me know that he was sorry for the mistake, that it would be ready in two minutes. The pizza came out hot and just a few minutes after the rest of the table's food. It was hot and delicious. I was a happy customer.   THEN!! Another manager came up to let me know that they were preparing my order again for no charge, for me to take home. They'd also knocked one of my two beers off of our tab!   As a former restaurant manager, I'm so discouraged when an establishment just doesn't care about the customers' experience, doesn't take any pride in their own service or their product.  Someone at Hawthorne's is doing something RIGHT! THANK YOU! Give the managers a gold star.   PS - everyone agreed the pizza was excellent, and we were there with a native New Yorker, and you know how they are..."}
{"text":"Easy carry-out and friendly staff. Stromboli, knots, pizza, mozzarella stix all deliver. Priced well too."}
{"text":"I wish I had taken a picture of my food before I ate it....it was beautiful---the salad was sooo fresh with dark green lettuces, dark red tomatoes, house made balsamic vinaigrette--oh my. And we split the buffalo chicken calzone; well, we ordered the calzone but he brought us the Stromboli. It was good too, but the buffalo chicken calzone is made fresh and is a little larger---make sure they bring you the calzone as the Stromboli is good, the calzone is best.   Wonderful meal!  Oh, a really delicious strong tea!"}
{"text":"We We recently moved here from NY so we have been searching for our go to place here in Charlotte.  This is our third or forth time we have been here and previously with friends.  The crew is friendly and helpful from when we walked in the door.    The entrees are prepared fresh and are always colorful and delicious.  Very evident that they are proud to work here and put out a good product at reasonable prices.    We can't say enough nice things about Jessica and Kelly who have taken care of us several times now.  Cute, funny and very in tune to our needs.  Thanks for helping for helping us feel at home here Ladies."}
{"text":"First time here as I am new to Charlotte.  My waiter, Nat was wonderful and very attentive.  I ordered the Tri color pasta with peas, bacon and some diced onion in a Carbonara sauce.  Beautifully presented and very yummy.  My compliments to the chef. The manager/owner also came over to chat  with me about NY.  Everyone one was nice and made me feel welcome.     Linda (A NY Sicilian)"}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza, especially good marinara sauce. I had the portabello/Gorgonzola pie and it was excellent. My son had a cheese calzone and garlic knots-excellent. Another table had these huge salads and buffalo chicken pizza which looked great. They have lots of outdoor tables and a large indoor space."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm so far best crust I've tasted in Charlotte, lots of toppings on the pizza. Choice of 9\" pie or full . Yummy appetizers, we had the Cajun shrimp ."}
{"text":"This is one of the best spots in Charlotte to get a PIE.  I am a NY transplant in charlotte and have worked in the restaurant industry my entire life with a focus on pizza and pasta.  Hawthorne's does pizza just the way it should be.  Thin, fold-able crust, flavorful sauce with a good bite of basil and just enough mozzarella.  Friday night is usually pizza night at the house and we always go to Hawthorne's.  They are consistant and have a friendly staff.  The pizza is not only the great items, the wife swears they have the best salads in town, including the balsamic vinaigrette.    On a side note we have tried Due Amici numerous times and found them to be inconsistent and rude.   Even the Italians I knew up north had more hospitality than these guys."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I want yummy take-out and don't feel like cooking. Right around the corner, not too expensive, ready in minutes, huge portions, and deeeelicious. We always get their Ney Yorker pizza with pepperoni and an order of garlic knots (which are addictive to say the least!). My other favs include the Buffalo Chicken Tenders Salad and the Sausage, Peppers, and Onions Pasta in a creamy tomato sauce."}
{"text":"The Chop Salad is so good that we buy the ranch dressing and take a pint home with us every time we dine at Hawthorne's.  My son loves the Pizza and so do we.  The best is when I ask them to change the Shrimp Scampi with Broccoli to Shrimp Scampi with Spinach and they gladly comply and it is delicious!  the service is always great.  They have a great big booth for large parties and the patio is fun for big groups too.  Can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"My mister and I grabbed take out from here the other day, and we definitely will return. We called in an order for a cheese Sicilian pizza, garlic knots, and an antipasto salad. The gal who took our order over the phone was friendly, and her estimated pick up time of 30 minutes was on point. The Sicilian pizza was a great value. Huge slices and good ratio of cheese to sauce. The crust was super thick, and one slice was definitely filling. The garlic knots were not what I had expected; essentially, dinner rolls baked in chopped garlic. These were okay, and I am not sure I would order them again. The antipasto salad was great, and the balsamic vinegar dressing paired well. Ultimately, I think we both like the pizza better at Big Guys, but we are eager to try other offerings on Hawthorne's menu in the future."}
{"text":"Great to finally have Hawthorne's open in up and coming MORA! Good pizza and large salads. They've got a pretty solid craft beer selection. The mussels are amazing, might be the best item on menu. Still not too crowded yet so you can sit at bar and chat with other locals."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience..  went this past Saturday nite with family for Mothers Day.  Felt very welcomed from the front door to our table.  We got there early and had to wait for others in our party..  service was out of this world.  Food was just as fantastic.  Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Thank you to Stephanie and the wonderful staff for a great lunch experience Tuesday 6/5.  A few early miscues  Early in our visit were immediately and quickly rectify by Stephanie. The lunch was fantastic, as always.  Hoping to get the construction work around the building all done and out of the way to make you getting into the parking lot a bit easier. It is totally worth the frustration as this is a fabulous place to eat. Hope to see you all again very soon."}
{"text":"I went today in hopes of having some good pizza. By good I mean better than Pizza Hut or Dominoes. I had high hopes for the Luau pizza and the \"spicy\" chicken wings. The Luau pizza was nothing special. I have had better pineapple pizza at other places. The chicken wings were super dry. Ranch didn't even help. They were super super dry. They weren't spicy either!  The quality of the food was not worth the price.  The atmosphere was good. Everything look clean and customer service was also good. The food was definitely a disappointment. I probably will never go back."}
{"text":"It appears that the service has been going down hill. I've been eating and ordering from there for about a year and a half. I've been trying to support them since the road closure. Last time I ordered pizza they messed it up then they said they would give us a pizza for free next time. When I ordered that free pizza I felt like I got an attitude on the phone.   Just ordered two salads from them, which came to about $29. Yes that seems high but for good food I will pay. Well I get home and the buffalo salad is missing the dressing, no dressing on it either. I figure at this point I'll just move on to another pizza place that has better service.   Good luck, I hope you get that great service back that you once had."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch. I ordered a small cheese pizza.  It only took about 10 minutes to make.  The cashier was friendly and helpful. The pizza was pretty good, I had no complaints.  The crust was crisp/ chewy and it was very flavorful all together. Slightly pricey for a personal cheese pizza though. Will most likely try again."}
{"text":"Super middle-of-the-road pie. When the only other pizza around was Fuel they had more of a leg to stand on, but combine the slightly-higher prices, meh pizza, and no delivery and I find myself asking no one in particular why I got in the car to come pick up my 20 dollar pizza. Plus the parking here is superannoying.  Lunch is a steal, but unless you're grabbing a slice of the special (which I've never seen a veg-friendly option for) you're getting cold toppings tossed on top of a dried out slice and no cheese to help them blend. So even at 7.50 for slice, beverage, and salad, I just can't get stoked. Patio looks comfy, tho, so maybe I'm missing the beer+pizza+pal charm. In which case, this review is TBC!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  Wait time was a little long, but staff was friendly to me and my 4 year old so it was fine."}
{"text":"Eh- not great pizza but not terrible either. Garlic knots were pretty good. Service was barely mediocre. Won't be back. Many other options are far better choices if you are looking for pizza."}
{"text":"The worst steak and cheese I have ever had! I asked for it to be on a wrap rather than bread and it was, however there was no cheese on it at all. I unwrapped the entire thing to see if there was any at the bottom if the burnt steak and did not see any. I asked the waiter if there was cheese on it and he said, there is so little cheese you can't see it! What? He didn't offer to add more or anything although none existed. He brought my side salad in a togo box without me asking for it. I couldn't even see what was in the container the way he brought it out. The steak was burnt crumbles and just tasteless. HORRIBLE! They also did not have Dr. Pepper or Pibb.  Also there were lots of loud kids in there playing the crane machine at the door, which made me want to walk out as soon as I walked in.   As for the waiter, he would ask if we needed anything as he was walking by not bothering to stop. To sum my experience up bad service, terrible food, plain drink choices, and way too many kids. I would never go back."}
{"text":"The pizza is okay but DO NOT order pasta or anything similar. The portions are ridiculously small. You will feel robbed."}
{"text":"Pros: Their pizza is delicious and so many types of specialty pizza. Their food is always consistent. I've never had an issue with the taste and quality! Their wings are awesome.. and I'm from Buffalo, so I know. They're pretty quick. 20 minutes typically.  Cons: The staff is incompetent. Every time I've been there I've had an issue with staff. One time they ran my card and said it didn't work, but I used it 2 minutes previously and 2 minutes after and it was working fine, so I left. When I called my credit card company they said they never even ran the order through. They've gotten my order wrong. They've been rude. They never seem to understand.. basically.. they need to get it together! I wish they had delivery.  Would I go back? I've been exploring new pizza options. Their pizza is great, but they need to work on their customer service."}
{"text":"Nice place for pizza. Good amount of menu selections. Ally was our server. Ask for her, she is very helpful and pleasant.The fried ravioli appetizer is unbelievably good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just left this place. We first walked up to the place and two hosts opened both doors for us and we were greeted by everyone including the bar tender.. everyone was very friendly. Our server was very nice , made sure our drinks were refilled .. we never even reached half way with our glasses before she refilled. ON POINT!! We ordered Long Island wings which is a mixture of sweet and spicy.. the BEST WINGS EVER! Then we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and the white spinach pizza half and half. Food came out quick and the server kept checking on us . She was so friendly an even though she was working the bar also she never forgot about us. I am very happy with the pizza. I'm from NY and bf is from jersey.... so we are use to a certain taste when it comes to a pie or a slice. I will say this was a great experience. Will be coming back for those wings"}
{"text":"Oh Hawthorne's. Your food is tasty! Your prices are not. I've been here a few times. Each time the experience has been a good one except for the prices. The most recent visit was a bit different, in a good way. I attended a Mint Hill Chamber event and got to sample a lot of different dishes. The meatballs were good and so was the artichoke dip! They had also had a sampling of a few sandwiches too. Those brownie, with a bit of cherry in them, were fantastic!! Of course the service is friendly and the atmosphere is nice. Is the food & experience worth the price? Maybe."}
{"text":"I stopped in today to pick up a pizza to take home. I had SUPERB service from the moment i walked in the door until i left.   I ordered the chicken, bacon, ranch pizza. Let me tell you, it was one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten. I'm so glad i stopped in."}
{"text":"I've tried many pizza places around Charlotte over the years. And so far this is the closest I've found to true New York pizza. I'm not a big fan of theirs Sicilian (I feel it lacks flavor), but the regular pizza is really good. I can't speak for the rest of the menu and the service because I always get takeout. But it's definitely my go to spot for good pizza in Charlotte"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hard one to review. It has come highly recommended to me from friends and relatives, and I absolutely have to admit the food quality is very, very good. I've not had a dish, including the kids dishes, that weren't almost exceptional!   It has an acceptable, if a bit 'cool' atmosphere, and the wait staff tend sto be young, attractive, and very friendly. BUT! (and you knew it was coming with a 3-Star rating...) it is just not a good value.  For two examples: The Salads look large, but the bowls are quite shallow, and the kids plates might come with fries, but just not very many.  I always leave pleased with the quality and service, but unfortunately I've also always left slightly hungry and surprised at the bill."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for many, many years, and this is the best pizza I've had outside of John's Pizzeria in NYC.  The pizza is very good, and the rest of the menu has something for everyone.  The kids love coming here to get some dough and their own little pizza, but I must admit we've come to Hawthorne's on our own date nights, too.  Beer and wine selection are good if you have a particular preference, and don't overlook the lasagna if you aren't in a pizza mood.  The staff have a long tenure and will always take good care of you--that's part of the reason this is our favorite Charlotte 'go to' restaurant ..."}
{"text":"Just went here recently on a date. The food was wonderful.  The waitress was super friendly and the booth that I sat in was very comfortable too.  I had the spinach pizza and two margarita's. I plan to return here soon and reccommend it to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"I had the Greek Salad and was not disappointed.  The salad was large and all the ingredients complimented each other well.  My only negative feedback was pricing.  The add on for salad was about $3.95 which would have made my salad over $14.00. It was delicious but NOT $14 delicious.  They need to modify the add on charge. Monday is draft night, so I'll be visiting soon!"}
{"text":"I travel to Charlotte for work and found this gem. It's only me but I always get the Large Elizabeth. I always want to try something else on the menu but can never pass up the pie."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and discovered their Homemade Soup.  Best soup I ever had!  Perfect blend of flavors.  It was an explosion of good taste in my mouth from the first bite to the last.  Hawthorne's also has a nice atmosphere that's perfect anytime, day or night."}
{"text":"Here on 4/30/12  Really good barbeque chicken pizza and Caribbean wings. Also used the Boy Scout Camp Card and got 10%off ! Good, friendly service ."}
{"text":"Just how I like pizza joints- muted lighting and comfy booths. Pizza and knots are to die for. My husband actually researches pizza places before ingesting, so all these great reviews and mine that you are reading are correct. Kids can walk up a mini staircase to watch the pizzas being made, and they might even get a ball of dough to play with. Prices are just fine. Go if you are a pizza junkie."}
{"text":"We were looking for a spot to show down on New York style pizza, and found just that at Hawthorne; however, it wasn't a memorable experience. The pizza toppings were fine, the ingredients tasted fresh, but it is not a pizza that I have craved to go back and visit or that comes top of mind when I think the pizza craving strikes."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service, lots of families. I had the chicken bacon ranch pizza. I was underwhelmed with it. I'd heard so many people talk good about it that I may have expected too much. The kids liked it and didn't complain.  Beware of the parking lot on a busy night for some reason people park just about anywhere and block people in up against the fence area. Kids in the car ready to go and now you can't back out...that was pleasant ;)  We'll return, nice place."}
{"text":"Service was slow.  Messed up order.  Food was ok.  Service needs to improve significantly."}
{"text":"Im not ordering a take out chicken Parm from your restaurant anymore!!!! The simplest little detail, don't smash the foil wrap into the sandwich so half the cheese comes off.  I'm done.  I like this place,  been here a few times--the good is always good.  My rub is take-out--love their Chicken Parm Sandwich, but only if you eat in house.  I'm going to stop ordering for take out.  Ordered the sandwich twice this week, the second order I got two sandwiches.  The first time this week, got home only to find all the cheese, which makes the sandwich, all stuck to the aluminum foil the sandwich was wrapped in.  This time when placing order, I asked if they could wrap the sandwich different so we don't lose all the cheese- they also use enough aluminum foil to wrap several sandwiches.  Need to rethink how they wrap their sandwich.  Needless to say, got home only to find the foil mashed into the sandwich, pulling all the cheese off.  Again, won't order takeout out anymore.    Good place, and the food is good, but not for takeout.  Have to say, received feedback from owner and very positive response correcting the issue.  Refreshing to k ow feedback is received and taken seriously.  Can't wait to go back for the chicken parm sandwich.  Well, have to say, it's refreshing to have a restaurant read and act on the feedback.  John reached out several times, and was sincere with receiving feedback.  Went for dinner the other night which is always good, and our server Brian was great.   Went back today for my favorite chicken parm sandwich, takeout, and the cheese was not stuck to the foil!!!  Great restaurant and it's clear they care.  Cheesecake continues--back to thr"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Pizza and pastas are good. The veal cutlet sandwich is really good. The service isn't always great though."}
{"text":"Really nice place. We stopped after the Pet Palooza and had a nice lunch. They were so nice to bring the dogs water an I had an eggplant hero.  Nice place with outside seating."}
{"text":"Done with this place. Pizza is burnt EVERY time...and pizza gets thinner and thinner. Ordered a pizza today. Picked it up 10 minutes after ordering and it was cold and burnt. The norm for this place."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Ordered a simple NY style pizza with pepperoni. Excess oil/grease on top; bottom crust was limp and tough/chewy. Also, ordered a craft beer which they warned me would be served in a 10 oz glass.  No way that \"juice\" glass was ten oz.  (we have juice glasses identical at home. Measured when I got home-8 oz at very best when filled to the lip...which my beer was not"}
{"text":"Prat good lunch apot  my colleague and I both got the godfather sandwich with waffle fries and it was pretty damn good."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Hawthorne's location pretty much since they opened, and I don't think they've ever screwed up an order.  Pizza is delicious and if you haven't tried the Buffalo Wing Pizza, give it a whirl.  Meatballs for the calzones, or for a side dish, or even for a sandwich are also spot on.  They almost always have a new beer special on tap, so be sure to ask your waiter about that as well.  Definitely recommended, might be the best pizza in the queen city."}
{"text":"Their garlic knots are what keeps us coming back!! so good. Recently their pizza seems to have too much crust (and it's the hard kind, so it's not like you look forward to eating it)-- especially the individual sized pizzas-- might as well not even get one, bc it's all hard crust.  One other gripe: a place this local/friendly should not be rule ridden as to charge 75 cents for ranch! i mean come on.. don't nickel and dime, it puts a bad taste in our mouth. I always tip more and generally enjoy my experience more when a restaurant doesn't charge for an extra couple tablespoons of sauce/dressing!  that being said though, garlic knots are fab, and the pizza is very good. Much tastier than Fuel or any competitors. Great outdoor seating, too."}
{"text":"Best pizza around. The large pizzas are huge! Favorite local pizza place around Prosperity church/highland creek. Never had a bad pizza here."}
{"text":"My dinner date and I went here on a whim and I was glad to see they can serve people with celiac disease.  The hostess assured me of their practices to eliminate cross contamination and provided me the gluten free menu.  I ordered the gluten free penne Alfredo with grilled chicken.  The penne was a just a tiny bit undercooked but the grilled chicken was perfect and the sauce was good.  The order took about twenty to thirty minutes which was a bit long.    My dinner date ordered the tri colored tortellini which he really enjoyed.   Generous portion sizes, good sauces and will definitely be back for an easy night out."}
{"text":"This location is rough... I have been there many times trying to give them a chance but somehow they mess it up every time... the food is good it's just the staff. The bartenders are slow and don't multi task very well with the exception of one that works in the evening time. I have seen staff arguing in front of customers on 2 different occasions! On one occasion the cook came up front to argue with the bartender! It's just not professional... It needs some work..."}
{"text":"Went to Hawthorne's with a friend who was in town and wanting pizza, and we love this place! I appreciate that a piece of Elizabeth, our old neighborhood, exists a little further outside of the city. We had excellent service throughout our dining experience. We ordered the Crew Pizza with meatballs, italian sausage, banana peppers, and red onions. It came out hot, fresh, and delicious!"}
{"text":"I live near Hawthorne's so I've had a chance to go several times. It's a good place to grab something to eat, but I'm not in love with anything on the menu. I love that they have a lot of TVs, if you're looking for a place to watch a game. The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Garlic Knots how I love you so.   After constantly driving by, and even taking a cooking class next door I finally went to Hawthorne's! I went  on a Friday night, and started off with a small order (6) of Garlic Knots. These are delicious! (Bring Breath Mints) These guys are loaded with buttery garlic!  We ordered the 18' (8 slices)  Elizabeth Special (Pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers, white onions and mozzarella cheese) *$18.95  The pizza is pretty solid, the crust is thin, and crispy around the edges. The service was pretty good as well.  The staff was friendly and helpful when we were there.    Overall great experience, we will be back for more pizza, and of course....KNOTS!"}
{"text":"Good beers on tap and some nice sandwich and wing options. Best feature is large dog friendly porch for canine dining!"}
{"text":"I've had a range of experiences here, from being virtually ignored by staff due to a glut  of customers to finding ourselves overwhelmed by staff presence and attention. In either case, the food has always been the shining star.  Recently, we found ourselves with 2 of our friends' kids on a Sunday at lunchtime and were wondering where we could satisfy both of their taste requirements and find something for us as well. Right away, I thought of Hawthorne's. It's very kid-friendly and delicious.  When we arrived, our drink orders were taken swiftly (it was before noon and the crowd hadn't begun to flood in yet). We bargained with our server for a super custom salad for our 4th grader (small house salad with added bacon, salami, huge shreds of cheddar cheese and ranch), and settled on a large cheese pizza for the rest of us.  When my young friend's salad arrived, I was astonished at how beautiful it was and she was completely thrilled with its ingredients. I don't know where they get their ranch dressing, but it was REALLY good.   As for the pizza, they double cut it so it would have small pieces for our 6-year-old. Flavor was perfect and texture was on point.   For a huge pizza, custom salad and soft drinks for everyone, we skated by with a $25 tab. Not too shabby, if you ask me! When I was consulting the table as to the proper tip amount, my 4th grade friend exclaimed, \"Give him 10! He got me an awesome salad!\"  We agreed.  Thanks, Hawthorne's. Home run."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went last night to try this restaurant for the first time, but neither of us ended up getting pizza. Maybe that was our mistake because overall our meals were kind of \"meh\". The prices were fairly decent and the service was attentive, but the food was not very good. I had mushroom ravioli and he had chicken Parmesan. The sauce on mine was very heavy, and the ravioli was definitely not fresh. The chicken Parmesan tasted like it was made with frozen chicken cutlets and was bland. We will probably come back some time and try the pizza, but the pasta offerings were not great."}
{"text":"My owner goes here regularly and seems to be happy when he comes home.  He says the pizza is really good and particularly likes the Buffalo Chicken and Luau pizzas.  The chicken wings and calamari are both good as is the house salad with Balsamic Vinagarette dressing.  He dropped a leftover piece of Calamari on the floor and I really liked it.  They also have good lunch specials (wraps and salads).  They have a good beer selection and on Monday nights all drafts are discounted.  There is a small bar area if you just want to grab a drink and an outdoor patio that is nice when the weather is warm enough.  There has been some recent turnover in wait staff since a couple of new neighborhood places opened up but hopefully the new ones will stay and keep the neighborhood feel that you don't get at Concord Mills."}
{"text":"By far the best rendition of NY Style pizza in Charlotte.  This was our first visit and we will definitely be back. Although we live closer to the Ballantyne we will go there next week.   We just had a pizza with bacon and it was perfect.  They use good cheese,  an excellent sauce and perfectly crumbled bacon.   Good atmosphere for kids too n"}
{"text":"The garlic knots are insane! Great selection of pizza, pasta and salad!"}
{"text":"First time experience at Hawthorne's and I'm definitely a fan. We sat in the bar area, on a relatively busy night, and were able to get a high top right away. We had a couple beers--they have a full bar with a pretty good selection of drafts. We ordered the garlic knots (amazing!) and a New Yorker--cheese pizza. The food was delicious. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"One of my very few complaints about food in NY vs. Charlotte is that they can't seem to figure out pizza and wings down here with any level of consistency.  Hawthorne's pizza is pretty solid, though, and one of the better pizzas you will have in Charlotte IMO.   The downside is that it is extremely greasy pizza and your stomach feels it into the next day.  I would just recommend not going crazy on the pepperoni pizza here in order to avoid the pizza hangover."}
{"text":"This place is great. My family and I frequently dine here. The pizza is so good and the dishes are stupendous. I've had a few of the pasta dishes, the calamari, onion rings and fried jalapeño and a few of the salads.  The garlic knots are fresh, delicious and swimming in garlic and oil, just like I like them.  Recently I had their buffalo chicken salad with grilled chicken and ranch dressing and I almost licked the plate. That's how amazing that buffalo sauce was!  It was tangy and spicy and everything you'd want in a buffalo sauce and more. The food here is just so good!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner there for the 1st time. Passed by the other day & couldn't forget the smell wafting thru the car windows! :)   Service was quite slow & they weren't even close to being busy, so that was a turnoff & not a good 1st impression! The hostess needed an attitude adjustment as well. You're a hostess, not a princess.   But the pizzas were fantastic! True New York style for sure (reminds me a little of Johns Pizzeria in Midtown Manhattan). I had a 9\" meat lovers & my partner had a 9\" white. I was quite impressed when I asked the waitress if I could sub the ham for kalamata olives & she said \"sure\" without hesitation! Most other places would have been all \"um no, sorry\" or \"well ok, but you'll have to pay extra.\" Not here--no problem at all! I'm generally not a cheese pizza fan, but that white pizza was oh so yummy! The crust was just right (not to thick but not paper thin), and they had no problem getting the cheese extra brown for me either. I'd always heard & read great things about Hawthorne's (& didn't realize there were other locations), and tonight I see they're all true. I think H's is my new favorite \"pizza joint!\"   They also had a great selection of pastas & salads too; not just the kind a lot of other places have that look like an afterthought; like \"oh yah, and we serve this stuff too just in you don't want pizza.\" These looked like true, restaurant-quality dishes. Can't wait to try'em!   The atmosphere was cozy & very welcoming & \"local.\" Although it wasn't busy, there were several regulars that the staff knew, so that says a lot about the place. Great place for everyone, from frat guys wanting pizza 'n beer, to post soccer team families, to after church groups, to teenage study groups."}
{"text":"Great pizza , great sandwiches. Have some great lunch specials.  I know, it's a pizza place but tried their chili today. Wow, got to be the best chili in Charlotte, yes even better than at that certain Restaurant on Monroe road.  A little noisy on weekends but what the heck.  Love this place and wife and I usually eat there twice a week.  Veggie Wrap is AWESOME."}
{"text":"Wow, where do I even start?! This was, simply, one of the best pizza experiences I've ever had. As a group, we ventured to hawthorns to pick up our pies... but then decided the atmosphere was warm, welcoming, and full of life..so we gathered and rejoiced with a drink from the bar. FANTASTIC service!! The bartender was sweet as \"pie\"! Everyone was great! But... Matt, spelled with two T's, is the heart and soul of this restaurant. Talk about a real hero, ladies and gents. He took our order with so much grace and patience (as we changed and added to it multiple times )and welcomed a classy group of calm, young and quiet professionals into his restaurant. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Matt.  also... the food was Delicious!!! From the pizza's, to the French fries , to the honey mustard dipping sauce.. I would describe this food, as the young ones all say, as DANK. Would recommend to all!!"}
{"text":"What a difference a manager makes. We went to Hawthorne's Saturday night. We ordered a pizza and right away we noticed the manager, \"JT\" was asking us what we were drinking. He refilled our glasses, brought us our plates and checked up on us several more time. We also noticed that he was all over the place, helping servers, seating guest, etc. One of the waiters who was working the other night must have remembered us because out of the blue, JT came over and apologized for the poor service we received from the manager Renee on Wednesday night. He even adjusted our bill to make up for being over charged on the previous visit. The owner John told me he wanted to make this right, and he did by hiring JT as a manager. I believe John's other managers should be trained by JT, since he exemplifies what it means to provide good customer service. We will continue to come to Hawthorne's not just for the food, but for the good service."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem. Amazing pizza here, and the ingredients they use are extremely fresh. Our server was one of the nicest people I have ever met also. Also loved the atmosphere here. It's a sit down pizza place with a ton of TVs and a bar. If I lived in Charlotte, this would definitely be one of my go to places."}
{"text":"There have been some cool changes with this place lately. Portions went back up to standard size and the quality and taste is up as well =] Thank you! Very appreciated!  Recommend penne pasta with spinach and portobello!"}
{"text":"You can't beat a meal at Hawthornes !! Start with the garlic knots. Then choose from pizza, calzones, or pasta. You can't lose. We have been going there for years. The other thing you can't beat is the service. The Highland Creek location has some of the most professional, friendly, and hospitable servers I have ever seen. It starts with a warm greeting from Mary at the front door - she knows our whole family by name. She makes us all feel welcome and we just walked into a relatives home for a meal. Next comes the waitstaff. I can't say enough about Diane, Sharon, and HP. All 3 have are some of the best people we know. They always have a smile on their face, talk to our kids, and are willing to go above and beyond to provide the best service ever.  What do you get when you combine great food + the best staff ever? You get Hawthornes at Highland Creek !! Great job all. Keep it up."}
{"text":"3pm on a Friday was told they ran out of slices ? Isn't this a pizzeria? How do you run out of slices of pizza .........."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings!!  Service was excellent!!! Will definitely go back again! The staff including the manager were very friendly and willing to cater to our needs!. We went with a Groupon special because I had never been. Prices were spot on as was service. Will definitely be back with or without a coupon!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out Hawthorne's last night because we're moving to the area. Immediately walked in and felt welcomed. They had an awesome patio that was fairly large and the pizza was great!! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Visited Hawthornes on 7th Street last night (June 5th).  I was not expecting it to be so busy on a sunday night, the place was hopping!  Dispite the crowd, we were seated quickly and received impecable service.  Our waitor was Steven, ask for him to be your server....he was polite, well spoken, friendly, attentive and very knowlegable about the menu.  We ordered the Chicken Picata and a small pizza.  We were not disappointed, the food was soooooo good. Everything came out of the kitchen hot, fresh and quick.  We had a great time.  The resteraunt is very well run and organized, and the service was amazing!   I will be sure to visit again very soon."}
{"text":"Awesome place, love it!   Great waitresses and great food!  Sausage plate!  Pizza!  Beer!  Family fun!   Patio!"}
{"text":"Overall: The service was fast and the waiter was polite. We shared a garlic cheese bread, an order of fries, and a New Yorker 18 inch pizza, our total was $32. It was more than I expected. We sat outside.   Vegetarian: They have several vegetarian options with lots of topping choices. I highly recommend this restaurant to other vegetarians. The crust was thin and crispy and the pizza was cheesy. The fries were seasoned and waffle shaped. The appetizer was well-seasoned. It was all hot and tasty."}
{"text":"I recommend the Cajun pasta! I ordered it as takeout. My daughter loved it and she's so funny about food. The customer service was excellent. I definitely plan to go back in the future."}
{"text":"I frequently drive past the Hawthorne's location in Elizabeth, telling myself that one day I would stop in to give them a try. One evening after work a friend and I was in the mood for some Italian dishes. We were in South Charlotte, making this location an easy choice. We were greeted and seated quickly, with most of the other tables families with young children.   Normally I would have tried their pizza, but I was in the mood for pasta that evening. The service was very friendly and accommodating. The calamari appetizer was great. I wasn't as impressed with the bread that was given with our pasta, but that's a slight issue. Some people don't mind firm, heavily toasted bread but it's not my preference. The spaghetti and Alfredo were both delicious."}
