{"text":"Wonderful little find! We sampled a few small plates and all were delicious. Started with the cauliflower hummus, followed by a blue corn mole shrimp special, the Peasants Picnic and the pork belly. Service was friendly and attendant and the atmosphere  was great. We'll be back if they allow us. My wife committed a slight breach of etiquette by licking the shrimp plate, so we'll see."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for cheese, charcuterie, beer and wine. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly and the tapas menu never disappoints."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try LunaHombre and finally went there for lunch.  The food was fantastic and the service was great!  Also has a fun atmosphere.  Definitely recommend and will go for dinner."}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem.  Sliders might be the best thing I've had in any restaurant recently.  Everything we had was amazing."}
{"text":"Such a cute new addition to Belmont!!! Great wine and Tapas food selections (cauliflower hummus is a favorite). And the staff is great; enjoy talking wine with Taylor as well. Check out the wine tastings on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Love this place.....   Great Wine selection and an acceptable beer selection for a small place.  Fantastic food.....  Tapas remember small plates with great taste....."}
{"text":"Stopped by late on Saturday afternoon for a quick bite before leaving Belmont. Ordered the fabulous Sangria and wished we could have stayed for a 2nd or 3rd glass! Delish!! Had the small Picnic Plate with some yummy Deviled Eggs and the Chicken & Beef Skewers with Chimichurri sauce. If you are picky about a table you may be disappointed. The place is small but we rather enjoyed the window seating on stools."}
{"text":"Sitting by the window on a beautiful autumn evening, I enjoyed every bite of the 3 dishes shared with my husband. 

I am not a big cheese eater but the Ombra cheese was just nutty delicacy. He was partial to the Shakerag blue (cheese). 

The tomato bisque was creamy goodness with just right amount of tomato flavor. The grilled cheese sandwich was beautifully grilled though some may like it a bit cheesier. 

The pork belly was sublime.  

Service was on point and we got to enjoy nice conversation without being interrupted. 

People watching through the window was delightful. Belmont downtown is always charming. 

Best meal I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner...had the cheese and charcuterie, bread and olives and split a bottle of wine...we will go back."}
{"text":"Must say that I was very excited to try Luna Hombre. I absolutely loved Chris Boone's South Fork Deli and figured Luna would definitely blow my socks off. Unfortunately that was not the case. My husband and I don't mind eating in small quarters however the set up of the restaurant is odd. Options for seating are bar, 2 window seats, one high top and one table that seats 10. I get what the owner was trying to accomplish however I simply do not want to sit with 8 other ppl if I'm on a date. We sat at the window which was cozy. I ordered a sprite and was told they don't have that. I asked for any nonalcoholic option and was told San Pellegrino was it. We ordered the Pork Belly with fingerling hash brown (under seasoned) and poblano jelly (no flavor) and the Lamb/Veal meatballs (again, very under seasoned and bland) with red pepper coulis & tzatziki (very tasty). We opted for the cheese and charcuterie board with five items.  The Wild Meadow cheese was absolutely delicious as was the chorizo. It came with pickled onion/pickles served with bread with cranberries. Felt the sweet bread was a weird choice....I would have preferred focaccia or something savory. All in all those 3 items along with 2 beers was $50 and we left hungry. I want to love this place, I really do. Perhaps it was an off night. Probably will try again but hoping for a better experience."}
{"text":"I only give 5 stars when a place deserves it and this place does!! Tried it on a weekday night - the olive and crostini plate was delicious! That crostini was to die for! It also came with pickled okra which was very interesting! The argentine grill was superb but needed a little salt but the red pepper sauce with it was yummmmm. They has a meatloaf special that was the best comfort food on a delicious potato cake!"}
{"text":"If i lived closer I would come here every week!! We had dessert here- a waffle with local strawberries.  Sat at the bar. Servers were super sweet and friendly.  I cant wait to come back for drinks!   Oh and they played good music too"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant with a friendly staff. All are small plates, but everything we had was very tasty."}
{"text":"What a gem! This hole in the wall has some serious flavor. Located under the awning of the Belmont Drug Co. you might easily miss this place. With a capacity of twenty or so it might also be hard to find a seat. The place is worth the trip to Belmont with its picturesque Main Street reminding you of the warms a small town brings. The flavors and feel is big city focusing on great drinks and tapas. 

We started with the meat and cheese board which is just a classic. The patatas were next; topped with crisp chorizo and fresh herbs the saltiness pairs with the microbrews. The aoli could use some garlic to amp it up but the balance of a clean version worked too. The sliders had a great presentation with mature plating. The flavors were clean and complimentary with a perfect temp. Finally we had the Argentinian mix grill. This was okay... not a home run since the flavors seems more on the Indian side. The chimichurri was sweet which didn't seem to fit. The naming created a different expectation but with that aside it was a good dish with tender meat. 

The service was kind and prompt. They work as a team so plates and drinks don't wait. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Small wine bar/ restaurant with creative lunch menu and nice decor. Food was prepared well but bartender waitress could not care less about her customers. Her attitude was off-putting and she should find a job she might enjoy more."}
{"text":"We love LunaHombre! Taylor always surprises me with a new wine! The food is great and a nice place to relax and enjoy time with friends. Not a big fan of the pictures on the wall but still go as often as we can!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend management to understand what \"corkage fee \" is. I had dined with my family and ordered a bottle of wine from the restaurant and was told I had to pay a corkage fee. I thought it was a mistake so I asked and was still charged UMmmmm....Meaning of corkage fee is a charge made, as at a restaurant, for opening and serving each bottle of wine or liquor bought elsewhere and brought in by a patron, or, occas., 
So bizarre how a restaurant/management would charge this fee and yet not know anything about it. 
Restaurant Management 101. Two thumbs down"}
{"text":"My husband has been wanting to go to this place for a LONG time. Since I am a good wife I finally said yes, even thought their menu did not impress me. 
We got there around 7pm on a Thursday. The tables were all busy but there were spots at the bar. The place isn't to big so if you don't want to wait maybe you should get there early because it gets a bit packed. 
The decoration is interesting and I really enjoyed the place, however the music was quite loud!
We ordered the patatas with aioli, pork chops with stuffing, mushrooms and bacon and steak and chicken skewers with a beans patty with a sort of chimichurri sauce. 
Even though the place was not that busy when we got that our food took FOREVER! Around 30 minutes for some tapas is way too long. They also only brought two dishes and the last one took at least another 5 minutes to get done. 
The potatoes were blend, they had some herbs on it but no salt at all, the aioli was the star of the dish, it made a huge difference in the flavor. The pork chops were to die for! So good, the stuffing was great but we could not identify any bacon in it, besides the pork chop was overcooked and as a result really tough. The chicken skewer was nice, the steak skewer was as blend as it could be. The beans patty and the green sauce that tasted as chimichurri were decent. The dish tasted like a taco without a shell. 
The service in general was fine but the kitchen is very slow. 
Overall the only thing I would give a second chance is the pork chop, but for their price I really doubt We will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved our initial visit here. Great vibe, cute as can be, friendly service, and a small, but well executed menu. Throw in well thought out, eclectic wine and beer offerings and you have a total winner in Belmont."}
{"text":"Flavor, flavor, flavor!!  Small plates enter the Belmont market!! Tired of hamburgers, sandwiches and chicken wings?  Then go to Luna's you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Belmont. The food is creative and DELICIOUS. I love the atmosphere and we have always had fantastic service. 10/10"}
{"text":"I'm leaving a review so I never forget the name of the place. Stopped off to eat while traveling. Top ten food experience. We wanted to lick the plates. Everything was amazeballs. Will be back next chance I get!"}
{"text":"Amazing find! Who would have thought a tapas restaurant in downtown Belmont.  Fantastic selection and great ambience.  Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Great little place in Belmont!  Great beer and wine selection and my sandwich was delicious.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The pimento queso was delicious... girlfriend had the ravioli and thought it was amazing and I had the lamb and venison meatballs which was good. We definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Amazing & artistyyyyyyy we love this spot, It gives Belmont a little touch of what it needs!"}
{"text":"This is our 3-4 times a week go-to place now. From the sliders of several delish varieties to the excellent soups and sandwiches, LH rules Belmont and Gaston County. And don't  get me started on the wine! Wonderful around the world selection...Chris in the kitchen and Taylor in the front of house keep us coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute and everyone is super nice! They have a great selection of wine, beer, and other beverages. This is probably my favorite place in all of Belmont."}
{"text":"Holy hidden gem, Batman! I'm talking about both downtown Belmont and Luna Hombre here... Who knew Main Street Belmont was so stinking cute (after dinner we wandered into the adorable Belmont's Specialty Grocery and then the hoppin' Station Bike Shop/Bar) and that it's home to Luna Hombre, one of the best tapas and wine bars I've ever visited? 

We arrived around 7pm on a Saturday night via Uber from Charlotte. It was a quick and easy ride up I-85 and only cost us about $25. Less than a DUI, folks! We needed a spot for 5 people and lucked out grabbing the last seats at the bar. The place is pretty small. Besides the bar seats, there are two window seats, a couple 4-tops in the back, and a long, communal table that probably seats 8-10. This is not the spot to come with a large group. 

Bellied up to the bar, I started with a glass of sangria, on special for $5. It was tasty and a great segway into the bottles of red that followed. We ordered a couple tapas throughout the evening and every single bite was better than the last. First out of the gate was the spreadable salumi. I love a good 'nduja and this one did not disappoint. Then came the chicken mole, patatas, and Argentine mixed grill. Everything came out piping hot and was so full of flavor. Again, we loved every single bite! Our friends ordered the chocolate cake with strawberry sauce and were kind enough to share a few bites. It paired perfectly with the bottle of Petite Syrah we were drinking. 

We will be back and often, I-85 be damned!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best in the area.  This owner is two for two.  Fairly simple tapas style menu but loaded with flavor.  If you're looking for a big fat cheeseburger or steak this is not your place.  If you want a lite meal loaded with style and taste and a great glass of wine, this is it."}
{"text":"LunaHombre is a fantastic little spot that's easy to miss.  It's quite small with some communal seating, but you'll forget about the people sitting next to you when the food comes.

We went last weekend and it was so good and memorable we came back the following weekend.  Our first time there we started with a charcuterie board with coppa, sopressata, and three cheeses.  It was a great start to a memorable meal.  We followed that with their cauliflower hummus and Argentine mix grill.  It was all delicious, and both the chicken and beef on the mix grill were cooked perfectly.

One of the coolest things about the place were their drink specials.  $2 for a \"poker\" which is a random pint of craft beer of their choice.  $2!!  I got a New Belgium Citradelic as well as a beer made from sweet potatoes, which was different but good.  My wife had the $3 sangria special, and that was delicious as well.

On our return trip, we got the peasants picnic, which includes cheese of your choice, house pickled veggies, honey butter, two kinds of bread, and outrageously delicious chorizo deviled eggs.  This menu item is one that we won't be able to go without the next time we're there.  We got the pork belly, which was perfectly cooked and deliciously rich.  My wife doesn't care for the super fatty bits, but that just meant more for me.  We got the cauliflower hummus again, and finished it off with the grass-fed beef sliders, which were substantial for sliders and again, perfectly cooked.

I don't have enough good things to say about this place.  Service is excellent, staff is friendly, the decor is funky and cool, prices are reasonable, food is fantastic, and drink specials are bananas.  It's right in downtown Belmont, too, so there are plenty of places to hit up after you're done with dinner, unless you want to just hang out at LunaHombre's bar, which isn't a bad option.

I can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"Another hit for owner Chris Boone with his 2nd area restaurant, LunaHombre. An eclectic spot showcasing a thoughtfully crafted menu featuring small plates with big flavour. The Décor, wine selection, friendliness and knowledge of the staff were tops! Seating is either bar-top or communal style, so if you have a social phobia this isn't your place to dine. 
We started with Cheese & Charcuterie; our choices were made with the guidance of our server and they all hit the mark! We added a Peasant's Picnic, and just as another Yelper stated, the chorizo deviled eggs are incredible! Only 2 come on the plate so plan accordingly. 
We ordered the 2 nightly specials and an Argentine Mix Grill all to share. The bean cake was unexpectedly delicious and piquant sauce was the perfect balance to the chicken and steak skewers. Between the 3 of us all plates were just about wiped clean! Sadly, no room for dessert.
Looking forward to future visits and exploring all of the menu options!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go in Belmont for lunch. Everything on the menu is excellent! I really like the house made items, and they have a great wine selection."}
{"text":"Amazing original food. The chorizo deviled eggs are out of this WORLD. I have had the chicken skewers and braised beef ribs they were spectacular. Both dishes were awesome. The  chocolate mousse makes for an epic finish to an amazing meal !"}
{"text":"Went in to Luna today and had a cheese board and the Lamb and veil meatballs!! Phenomenal!! The cheese board came with a to die for fig spread and beer mustard!! I absolutely recommend this place for dates as well as just a quick bite!! The atmosphere is very romantic..."}
{"text":"This is my first ever review, but my experience was so disturbing I feel compelled to share. I was having a great afternoon with my sons exploring downtown Belmont and found everyone to be charming and welcoming.  As we visited the local businesses, I ducked in to check out LunaHombre. (It still says Belmont Drug outside, so I wasn't really sure what kind of place it was.)  It was beautiful inside, though completely devoid of patrons,  but as a wine lover, I certainly would have returned. However, I was accosted by two people on the way out, one a server, who asked me for the first time in my adult life \"Did you use the restroom?\" and telling me it was just for customers, along with an obviously inebriated patron (I assume, the server said he didn't work there), who berated me because my teenaged sons were on the public city street in front of the restaurant.  I found out later that he had put his hands on my son to move him down the street--had I known that, there may have been authorities involved.  I will return to Belmont, but LunaHombre will definitely not be on my agenda.  And based on the emptiness and the reception I received, I would not be surprised if it doesn't last long in that lovely, warm downtown area."}
{"text":"Met a friend for dinner here while in town for work.  Super cute!  Although for an out of towner it was tricky to find as signage wasn't super prominent.  The main street area was so charming!

We ordered a mix of small plates and wine.  All were very tasty but my favorite was the sliders with pimento cheese.  Pimento cheese isn't super prominent where I live so I took every chance I could to have it on just about anything while I was in town!  Service was good, friendly and helpful.  Great spot to munch and have a few drinks!"}
{"text":"I like it, I don't love it, but I like it. I think supporting local business that's bringing a taste of class to very small community is awesome. I do think it's a little overpriced for what you get, but what you're paying for is some atmosphere and great service. This is an excellent place to take a date because they won't be embarrassed about eating too much in front of you because the portions are small. Make sure that you don't miss it. It's in the old Belmont pharmacy building in downtown. It's worth a try to form your own opinion."}
{"text":"So wowed by this hidden gem. 

Came on a Tuesday evening. Surprise! They have a wine tasting 6-8. $5 got me 4 pours and a small plate! Quite the deal! The small plate was a crostini with pepper jelly and goat cheese. 

We then ordered something referred to as the \"picnic.\" Included 2 deviled eggs, bread and butter, cheese, and pickled veggies. Yummy thing to start with!

Also had sliders with pimento cheese. Excellent and just the right size!

Next was curried shrimp with perfectly buttered toast. This was probably our favorite dish. So simple, but so delicious!

Last was a chocolate mousse. Light and fluffy and the perfect finish! Not too heavy.

The place has a nice atmosphere, and we loved escaping busy Charlotte for a night in a small downtown. Staff was also excellent! So kind! We will be back. Perfect date night spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the second time and still could not order anything hot. How this place stays in business whey they can only serve meat and cheese before 4 or 5 is beyond me. The place is super cute but the puss on the lady who serves you will wipe any smile you brought in off your face. You really need to replace her. You should be able to stop in here any time from 1 or 2 on and be greeted like the person serving you is happy you have arrived...or your place will fail...just a tip"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this place on a Wednesday specifically for their specials (half off glasses of wine and appetizers). It was lovely! I ordered a glass of their Sauvignon blanc and we split a meat and cheese board. I was impressed with the goat cheese especially, but wish they had more variety for bread than \"toast\". I like traditional crostini and naan bread with my cheese--which is a total personal preference and no fault on their part. I wish the seating was a little different as we found a spot by the window, but then had others sit near us and kinda cramp us while we were eating."}
{"text":"Solid go to place for small plates, great beer and a hipster vibe.  Food and people are groovy."}
