{"text":"This store has a great selection of latin products.Unfortunatly the staff isnt very friendly.half of them dont even speak english.I walked in and the girl at the till ignored me and rolled her eyes as she continued to chat in spanish with her co worker."}
{"text":"Lunch counter is always awesome, great giant burritos, great tacos, nice selection of meats & toppings. Always get the horchata & an Inca Cola. Columbian specialties were great. Nice friendly staff. Haven't tried the desserts but they look great."}
{"text":"Great beef empanadas, full of surprises and delicious! Good selection in the market with cheap hot sauce! Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. What more could you want??"}
{"text":"I was so excited to stumble upon this place. I was there Saturday and around lunchtime.  They had so many types of tacos and Latin American foods, it was hard to choose.  I ended up getting a mixed plate of fried ribs, chicharron, plantains, potatoes and other fried bits.  And a dark mocilla ( blood sausage stuffed with rice and green peas). They have tons of space for customers and the Latin mart was clean and well stocked with all kinds of goodies from Latin America. I saw deride avocado leaves, and corn husk shells for tamales and all kinds of dried chillies. 

Am definitely returning to try out the tacos."}
{"text":"This is a unique lunch experience. When you walk through the doors you're greeted with Latin music. To the right, you have a Latin food market where they sell Latin grocery. In the back middle, you have a small fresh butcher meat shop. To the left, you have a small cantina with extra long bench tables. I can't say much about the fresh meats and the grocery other than it appears to have a decent selection.  So back to the left side, you have Latin food at decent prices. We ordered 2 tacos, a burrito and a empanadas.  The tacos and burritos were very fresh tasting, very filling but somehow lack in flavours.  Fortunately,  the hot sauce was delicious so the burrito and the tacos were decent. I found the chicken a bit dry.  However, my date thought it was was fine. I enjoyed their empanadas, it's a bit different because it's deep fried instead of baked, so it's much more crispy. Overall, it was decent but given other selections of taqueria in the city, we will likely revisit other places prior to returning here."}
{"text":"My coworker introduced Unimarket to me. They sell a small amount of vegetables, frozen food, dried chilis, baked goods, general groceries, meats and they have a little cafeteria in the back of the store. Most people come here for the cafeteria - tacos, burritos, and other cool dishes, like fried meats.

Unimarket makes the best guacamole in the city. I don't know how they get the guacamole so smooth and creamy, but still in chopped up cube form. The flavor is unreal. It tastes so vibrant. The chips we got were freshly fried. This huge cupful of guacamole and chips only cost $5.00. One of the best deals in town.

I've tried the tacos and quesadillas. I prefer the quesadilla because the tortilla is crispy and I like the simplicity of the cheese and chicken. The tacos are the real deal and taste more authentic than the ones I eat in Cabos/PV."}
{"text":"Si, Si, Si...muy bien! What a great find. It is about time that there was a great Latin market in Calgary. Here, I can find many of those specialty items that I buy when I am in Mexico or South America. Now I don't have to sneak them back. Unimarket has a great variety of condiments, spices, herbs, pastes, special treats; you can find produce, cheeses, frozen empanadas and pupusas etc.; they make fantastic home made specialy salsas, though they are not always available; add to that, uplifting fizzy beverages like Ponymalta, Columbiana and Mexican Coke (to name a few), and you have a great store.

They have an eat-in area with some of the best sandwiches in the city, at very reasonable prices - the trick is, you may have to guess at what you are buying if someone who does not speak English well is working that day, but oh well! That said, most of the staff can communicate well enough, and everyone has always been very eager to help out.

Last time I was there I noticed a renovation under way. It looks like they are putting in some sort of a butcher counter and expanding their prepared food business. I am excited to see what is coming."}
{"text":"The majority of their products are expired and over priced. They are tricky that way, PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THE EXPIRY DATE!
There are far better places to buy good quality latin products"}
{"text":"This review is specifically about the eat in portion of the business.  Previous reviews have mentioned a sandwich bar and I do recall seeing one before the renovations, but now they offer a variety of hot Mexican dishes.  I tried two of the four or five kinds of tacos and both were delicious.  Add some fresh toppings, pick from three or four homemade salsas ranging from no heat to dangerous, and you have an excellent meal.  At $3 per taco, the size and quality is hard to beat.

My only real complaint is that, with no posted menu, ordering is a bit daunting unless you speak Spanish, which most of the clients seem to do.  I ordered the beef and pastor tacos as I was familiar with them, but I'll have to learn some Spanish so I can go back and try everything else."}
{"text":"Unimarket is my go to spot in town to eat tacos. I generally get Susanna's Combo, which is beans and rice with two tacos of your choice for $9.99! I usually get my tacos pretty traditional as well, with just onion, cilantro and lime juice squeezed on top, but they have a variety of salsas, guacamole and other veggies you can get. I've tried every flavour and they're all good and juicy."}
{"text":"The best!
Fresh ingredients....nothing from a jar.
$2.50 per on Wednesday - fill up.
Meat is always trimmed up lean with no grizzle or extras.
Adders are fresh and flavourful.
The ladies working the counter are super friendly and prompt.
I am a huge Al pastor fan and they never disappoint.
Lots of free parking out front too.
Go and get some tacos at Unimarket"}
{"text":"Ordered from here off of skipthedishes and it was sooooo good. A thousand times better than mucho burrito etc. Highly recommend!"}
