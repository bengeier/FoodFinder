{"text":"Tasty? Hardly. It was over-priced diner food swimming in grease. I had a burger that dripped so much fat the entire plate it came on looked as though I had just eaten a bowl of cereal, only instead of milk I used melted lard. I asked for a second napkin not quite convinced the first I had been given wasn't just single-ply toilet paper taken from the bathroom and was instructed to use the paper menu under my plate if I needed something else to wipe up with. Somewhat bothered by the glib nature of the remark, I resigned to try but unfortunately, the menu under the plate was already completely transparent indicating it had already absorbed its capacity of oil. By stark contrast to the burger, the pizzas were terribly dry, having been baked to death and then presumably left somewhere unattended for several hours allowed to leather like an old French-fry wedged between the dashboard and the windshield for an entire summer before being noticed. Not worth even half the asking price, already unreasonable for the miniature portions. 

The \"food\" is served by staff you have to remind multiple times that you've asked for a drink and still not received it (even after the food has come) or when you would like to pay the bill and leave.  Once I ordered delivery and nearly had to call the police the driver became so hostile and rude, offering insults and badgering me for a larger tip complaining about the cost of gas and having a family to feed in his homeland and that I should be able to afford to pay him more of a tip since I can afford the pizza. My girlfriend once told me they had to have security escort him off their office property when he got irate they wouldn't pay for the wrong order he was delivering. Avoid at all costs? Avoid even if free."}
{"text":"Tasty Food is a step up from your average pizza joint with a really nice, modern and clean dining room where one would be fine bringing your family with kids or entertaining an informal business lunch.
Pizza is always a personal choice and whether you like thin/ thick crust or New York, Chicago or Napoli style makes all the difference as to your dining pleasure.
I personally like ALL pizza styles and especially TF's version which is distinct from just about every other pizza in Mtl.
My favorite is a pepperoni well done with the tips of the curled pepperoni just a little bit crispy..Y.ummmm.. 
TF is nice place and the food is honest and hearty with reasonable prices .
As for other selections there's a healthy choice of those for those (heaven forbid) who come to a pizza parlour and don't want pizza.
As other raters have mentioned the lentil soup is special.
A solid, family-run neighbourhood restaurant, TF is timeless and unchanged over the years, just the way I like it. Comfort food for the mind as well as the stomach."}
{"text":"Tasty Foods is utterly unique and delicious. I've been eating their pizza for about fifty years, from the various locations and they're as great as ever, especially their spicy and delicious pepperoni pie."}
{"text":"If you are a west side Montrealer and have not experienced Tasty Foods, shame on you! :). Same staff, different location, but same unique sauce, pepperoni, and crust (I highly suggest ordering well done).  Individual sized pizzas; pre-selected or make your own.  Great delivery, but if you pick up: 3 for price of 4. Look, I grew up on the stuff. Living outside of MTL for 14 years, I can vouch that this is one unique pie that will keep you ordering again (eating there; meh!). And they have much more than pizza...."}
{"text":"They still make a tasty pizza. Bacon & pepperoni makes for a solid combo. Grilled cheeses are also pretty good if you're not in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to this place by an
Old friend his dad and uncle used to work there back in the day. The older waitress is very sweet and always came to chit chat at our table and share old memories from when they worked together. 

Pizza is what you go for, I always got cheese because I don't like change but I will bite on other great flavours like pepperoni. Each pizza is individual u could split it but it's mostly made for one. They have meatballs as well and it's just a little bowl with one big meatball in tomato sauce. 

Great spot to check out I guess it's a hit or miss I haven't been that often to know the crowd favourites but I would stick with the pizza and meatballs."}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza place when I want something good and quick. They have good pizza with great choice of toppings. They also have a gluten-free dough if you want to avoid the comatose-induced feeling after having eaten breads and pastas.

They also have a good selection of salads and they make a mean lentil soup. Yes! Lentil soup. It's extremely tasty and hearty. Good for cold days! 

So if you are looking for a better option than your local 2 for 1 pizza joint, Dominos, and Pizza Hut. Tasty food is a way better option."}
{"text":"Very good. Sometimes a little pricey. I go way back. Had birthdays there. Even across the street. It's very unique. Definitely worth a try!!"}
{"text":"Kind of hard to believe that after something like 30+ years someone would finally write a review for their pizza (and its me!). I used to have all my bday's here and then one day, it burnt down. Who was that guy \"Magic Mark\" anyway? Then they re-opened again and wow, that same Pizza came back into existence. 

I still remember the owner's son who was a friend of mine as a kid. Telly I think. Owner was Nick I believe. Great people. Wonderful food. Wish I was in Montreal to still eat it! Who says Greeks can't make pizza. In fact, the very foundation of Rome itself was Greek in two ways - Etruscans and Greek settlers (both Greek).

Never had pizza like this before or since. If I was them, I would publish a recipe book. 1000's of us would buy it!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for as long as I can remember. I usually go for the lentil soup! Excellent choice. The pitzza is ok, not the best in the city and a little over cooked for my taste.  Service is friendly but can't say much for the decor."}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than one star I would. Where to start, first off they re-heat old French fries in dirty oil. Even after I called back the second time to ask them not to. Their food is sub par and dirty. Now all that aside I had an issue with them messing up an order and called in to ask them to fix this, the girl over there was rude and defensive to my claims that the wrong toppings were placed on the burger we had ordered. I specifically said no tomato and she specifically repeated that back to me as we'll so I know it wasn't her fault. She passed me over to the manager who was really mad that he had to come to the phone and explained to him that the person is allergic to tomatoes and that we'd appreciate it if they could send us a new one...he said rudely \"no just scrape the fu@$ng tomato off. I told him that she's allergic and that there is still tomato all over even if we scrape it off. He said too fu&$% bad we're not sending you anything. I asked him why he was so mad and he said cause I'm fu%^# busy cooking wtf do you want and hung up. NOW THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Bottom line aside from the fact the employees are so jaded and disgruntled the food is just nasty dirty re-used oil re-heat fries and just dirty!"}
