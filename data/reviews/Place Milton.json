{"text":"Good basic breakfast. Not too fancy. If that's what you're after, this place is perfect. Lots of regulars."}
{"text":"This breakfast place is hit or miss. Sometimes the food is delicious and sometimes- well you don't know what you're eating, but the food is never undercooked and coffee refills are free, and it's the cheapest breakfast place closest to McGill University. On weekends and holidays, they serve all day breakfast, and if you're not lucky enough to go during breakfast time, they serve a mean cheeseburger for- you know, all the other meals. It's the perfect place to go when you're hungover, or when you wake up in the morning and decide that the chick next to you doesn't need to wear a bag over her head, and you want to get to know her."}
{"text":"My first review was two stars.  Obviously, the business complained to yelp, and those PW boys in yelp yanked my review.  So now, I'm cutting my review to 1 star, Anglo speakers aren't, IMO, welcome there.  Eat that!"}
{"text":"Really nice little breakfast place! Recommend their bagel and pan fried potatoes! Also very affordable."}
{"text":"THE spot for breakfast in Montreal!  Monday morning we enjoyed the early bird special of $1 off between 7-9am.  Portions, price and service were all superb."}
{"text":"A nice and affordable spot for a filling breakfast. I ordered two eggs, toast, sausage, homefries, and coffee for under $10. My food arrived almost immediately and it was delicious. My server was also very sweet and attentive. I will definitely make this a regular spot of mine."}
{"text":"Very rarely do I post reviews but I was greatly disappointed with this place that has been featured on a few websites. First of all I ordered the italian omelette, and ended up with some kind of egg burrito with unseasoned canned tomato sauce with a slice of cantaloupe and lukewarm potatoes, which I am supposed to assume were supposed to be breakfast potatoes. I was accompanied by my friend that played it safe and she as well received cold potatoes. We also had a fresh odor of smoke as the cook must have been smoking in the kitchen. 

All in all, I unfortunately cannot say that I would go back any time soon. Unless the cook changes."}
{"text":"Great little place to have breakfast/brunch!  Food was delicious. I had a smoked salmon omelette, and she had a 2-egg breakfast.  Very tasty and decent portions. 
Staff was VERY friendly and was happy to speak with us in English (not always a given when in Montreal). 

Pricing was also very good for the dishes received. 

This is a small mom/pop type shop, so decor was very minimal down to earth, not fancy, but well maintained and clean."}
{"text":"I looove place Milton! 
Very relaxed ambiance and friendly service. The order are always super quick to arrive and the portions generous. We used to go to Cora on Park, Place Milton replaced it. More classic then Cora, it serves 'traditionnal breakfasts'. I totally recomand this place if you are looking for an easy spot for hard week-end mornings! 
The only downside to this place is that it is not spotless clean. 
The also have a nice terrace in the back to enjoy your breakfast in an intimate outside spot."}
{"text":"Wow. First time in Montreal and could not have asked for a better breakfast. Not only was the food hot and delicious but it arrived in less than five minutes (it was off peak hours - but still!) and the entire meal including coffee was less than ten dollars. Service was friendly and the atmosphere was quaint. Would definitely recommend this place to any fellow first time montrealer. 

Only drawback is that you must request a Montreal bagel as opposed to a regular one! 

You won't regret eating here!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal breakfast. Staff are very French (it is Quebec, after all) which makes communication tough for an anglophone like me. The food is too good to care, and the best part: it's cheap!"}
{"text":"Tried to go here for brunch. Waited in line over 30 minutes while no one was clearing the dirty tables. 

Eventually we were told that they had run out of eggs. At a breakfast place. Awesome.

Avoid it and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Resto déjeuner par excellence dans le ghetto McGill, donc arrivez avant 10h30 la fin de semaine si vous ne voulez pas attendre. La cuisine n'a rien de révolutionnaire que du déjà vue(uf, viande, crêpe, toast, bagel...). Les patates ne font pas l'unanimité ... moi je les aiment. On offre des burgers très convenable le midi. Dites vous que vous passerez de l'état j'ai faim à j'ai plus faim pour 10$. La semaine avant 9hr il y a 1$ de rabais sur une sélection de déjeuner. Le service est offert par un heureux mélange de jeunesse et de sagesse... toujours courtois et efficace même pendant les \"rush\" de fin de semaine.

Pourquoi 4/5 : Ici c'est personnel et viscéral. C'est bruyant, plein de vie étudiante, de nostalgie et d'énergie positive. Parfait illustration des 3 choses les plus importante pour un commerce : \"location location location\". J'y ai commencé d'innombrable journées d'été lorsque je travaillais au centre ville. Derrière dans la ruelle, une charmante petite terrasse ouverte tous l'été. Le ghetto McGill où si vous aimez mieux Milton Park est un de mes 3 quartiers préférés à Montréal. Les vieux arbres , les duplex et triplex bien entretenu, les ruelles bien aménagées et la proximité avec le centre ville. On est dans un l'îlot de calme et de charme à 2 pas de la ville! C'est donc plus pour la localisation, l'ambiance et l'endroit que la nourriture que c'est un incontournable. 

Pour ceux que ça intéresse: 
Dans les années 70s, le quartier Milton Parc était voué à la destruction pour être remplacé par des tours d'habitation, magasin, espace commerciaux .... Un entrepreneur avait aux cours des années réussi à acheter la plus part des duplexes et des triplexes du quartier. Grace à l'agitation populaire et à une crise économique providentiel le projet ne fut pas complété. Plusieurs immeubles intact furent acheté par une COOP d'habitation qui existe encore aujourd'hui. La  premières phase du projet initial fut complété (La Cité I, II et III ; Place de la Cité). Placez-vous au coin des rues Prince-Arthur et des Pins et constater le désastre... Il reste encore de très belles maisons de style Queen Anne qui embellissent mes escapades dominicales."}
{"text":"This is a brunch staple for McGillians. A very modest looking place. Have been seeing the same staff for ages so I assume it's a family run place.

The prices here are really good. You getting you regular eggs and bacon for $6.75. I usually go for the omelettes though. I once tried their chocolate crepe and it was huge in portion!

What brings me back is their home fries, one of the best anywhere. Try it with Tabasco sauce if you like spicy.

It's cash only.

If you go during summertime, you can sit at their pleasant terrace.

Place Milton is quite constant with their food quality. Been there multiple times but always the same great home fries!!"}
{"text":"Warm atmosphere for brunch near McGill.  Long menu with many omelette options.  Note: cash only!  
I had the Milton and my wife the petit bourgeoise -- both very tasty,  interesting and well prepared.
We will come again during our next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"The best $5 breakfast you can buy - Beauty's on a budget! Usually filled with McGill students scarfing down \"Le Place Milton,\" which is the best meal on the menu, including eggs, (very buttery) toast, and homefries. If you're hungover Sunday morning, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"My visit to Place Milton was an underwhelming experience. I went there looking for a lunch spot that would change from the usual places I go to on Sherbrooke around the St-Urbain Street area. Basically, you get something almost as expensive but less tasty than you would at Moulin Lafayette or Godley and Crème. I had an ordinary sandwich with boring fries. Breakfasts I saw on other tables did not seem any better. The place seems very popular with students. On the plus side, staff was friendly, filter coffee was good, they have a little patio, and the place has a large window in the front. Still, I don't plan to go back; there are several better lunch options around there."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite breakfast places in the city. It is incredibly cheap and the service is 10/10 and the food is delicious. I ended up going there almost weekly as a student"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and service. Nice atmosphere. Facing a couple cool old buildings in the McGill University area."}
{"text":"Amazing place for breakfast! Not too expensive (except for the extra egg I asked them to toss in at $1.25). I'm trying to not eat that much bacon anymore because I'm addicted to it and so many options had bacon! I had to ask the waitress (really friendly!) to ignore any potential bacon requests...I ended up getting a Rustique (with the extra egg) and it ended being a pretty sweet option! My friend had the western omelette (recommend too!).

Downside: you can only pay with cash"}
{"text":"PROS:

1. I like this place for a cheap hangover breakfast. Hits the spot! 
Salty eggs, sausages, bacon + toast + refillable coffee. It's typical diner food and differs from Cora's in that there's no mountains of fruit, or healthy cottage cheese options and that's precisely why I like it (once in awhile). 

2. The food isn't super gourmet or ground-breaking but it is homey and the resto itself is very relaxed. You could go eat there in your pajamas.

3. Food is quick to arrive and service is friendly.

CONS:

1.Not a big selection of options on the menu. 

OVERALL:
-A great place for a lazy sunday, cheap breakfast without frills. 
-Cheaper than Cora's but less healthy
-I would recommend it to someone on a tight budget looking for breakfast in the Ghetto. It's not a place I'd pay $3 to take the metro for."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to grab a brunch in the McGill ghetto. The waiting staff are friendly and quick. Seriously, great for getting a deliciously large brunch. They have a similar breakfast as to McGill Pizza, but with some some differences. The biggest difference is in price; although, only by a couple of bucks.

Ok. So you're probably thinking, why rate them low if I also like the place? I'm giving a 3 stars and not more because... I have a bone to pick with them. If you want maple syrup its a $1.50 extra. I don't get what is with that actually! This is freakin' Quebec, and you're serving pseudo-syrup as if its deliciously magical. No thank you. I want the good stuff. On a more serious note, if you need some food to sop up that gut rot this is the place for you. Otherwise don't worry about traveling down the metro line for their \"fine\" cuisine."}
{"text":"Lovely breakfast and
wonderful service.  The
place fills up quickly."}
{"text":"How could I have missed this resto after living in Mtl for 4 years? Well, likely 'cause most of my McGillian friends have never come here. They should have. Place Milton is the place for hangover recuperation.
Though, mind you, it's not a bad idea to read there alone with a coffee. 

Very inexpensive breakfast. I think it was around $5 for a basic breakfast combo of coffee+eggs+sausages/bacon+toast. Coffee comes hot and fresh. A soothing balm for an upset stomach. 

I would not recommend going with more than one person. There's clearly a solo or couple atmosphere. Heard it gets really full on weekends."}
{"text":"Good, no frills breakfast. We grabbed breakfast here for no other reason that we were staying right around the corner and were pleasantly surprised.

My girlfriend got the bacon & eggs plate which came with homefries and toast. The bacon was cooked nice and crispy, and the homefries had a nice spiciness to them, very flavorful. I had \"Le 224\" special which was a St. Viateur bagel served with smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomatoes, and red onions. This is usually my go-to breakfast and it didn't disappoint but if I remember correctly I think it was a bit pricy, maybe $14? 

Either way still a tasty breakfast and our service was great. I personally can't stand when breakfast of all meals is a \"production\" (anyone else's gf do that?) so this is my kind of spot."}
{"text":"Staff was nice. The chef made an error on my order and the owner apologized and quickly fixed it. Not sure of their crêpes. I ordered strawberry crêpes thinking the actual crêpe would be folded with fresh cream and strawberries inside, but instead the chef added the strawberries to the batter. This created a more mushy crêpe than I'm used to eating. 

If you like scrambled eggs, they serve them dry - which I prefer. 

IMPORTANT: They ONLY take cash. No credit/debit - but there is an ATM in the back. If you pay in American cash they will not provide change using the exchange rate. 

NOTE TO STAFF: If you have cough with phlegm, please cough into shirt and not into wrist or your hand."}
{"text":"On Saturday, the husband took me to this place which he referred to as 'the hangover cure'. It did serve the purpose and I left full and minus a headache. 
I ordered the Italian omelette plate, it did taste good but I didn't prefer the stuffings being served in a blanket of egg. I usually like all the sausages, cheese and peppers cooked along with the egg. Their potatoes were good, the coffee was strong, I would also prefer more fruit with my breakfast. 
The waitress was helpful and left a good impression. I must however mention, there was a strong stench of cigarettes inside the restaurant which destroyed the whole experience for me. 

I'm glad I tried this place but it definitely won't come in my list of go to brunch places in the city. 

I wouldn't recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Incredibly cheap breakfast. Pretty good too.

I had \"Le Place Milton\". Roughly $10 gets you 2 pancakes, 3 eggs, toast, ham, bacon and sausages. My over-easy eggs were cooked to perfection. The sausages were good. Pancakes are not the big, fluffy kind... more like mini-crepes."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap, fast, simple breakfast place near McGill this is a decent option. The menu offers a lot of options and the staff is always very friendly and attentive. The food itself is quite greasy and nothing special, but in terms of quantity, you get a lot of food for the price. Quite good for hungover brunch on the weekend- although it gets busy.

They also offer an early-bird special during the week, which is -$1 off all menu items before 9am, making it even cheaper."}
{"text":"The only good thing I experienced here was the price. My breakfast consisted of burnt scrambled eggs, burnt toast, and soggy potatoes. My first cup of coffee was so weak it may as well have been water, and the second was extremely strong."}
{"text":"Basic and satisfying breakfast food. The most ample of the traditional combination breakfasts has toast, eggs, sausage, bacon, ham, pancakey crepes and potatoes for under $10. $1 discount on everything before 9 a.m., at least on weekdays. Omelettes are solid but modestly sized. Better-than-average diner coffee."}
{"text":"So Place Milton is my usual place, I have my usual there(the Rustique Bagel) and its pretty good for the price you pay. I'd say the price is pretty good, for an average-normal food you get for breakfast, as most places will be more expensive. 

Also here's a funny story of what happened:

As usual I ordered a bagel, and for a change we sat at the terrace(Yes they have a really small cute terrace there! Good for the summer). And anyways I needed ketchup for my potatos. So the waiter brings me the ketchup and says that I should be careful when I open it. So I open the ketchup really normal(didn't shake, didnt do anything, just opened the cap) and it literally  EXPLODED!(I have a picture I posted)The ketchup was all over the table the chair the next table, the guy sitting next to us, all over me and my friend and even the wall: So basically everywhere! Did not see that coming! that never had happened before. 

So anyways the waiter and everyone else including myself were shocked we were just laughing and thinking how this happened (apparently it happens when you keep the ketchup on the sun for a long time). 

Eventually they cleaned up, switched us to another table, and they changed all the ketchups to newer, glass ones! They also paid for my meal which was really nice of them. 

So, it's great here for a nice small breakfast outside and especially if you don't want to spend too much. I had a bad but funny experience but would still go back.( And now I'm always terrified to open those ketchups! )"}
{"text":"Decent breakfast place. Nothing special foodwise, inexpensive and excellent service but not a place for a food-lover."}
{"text":"Wasted opportunity.  They have all the things needed for a great little breakfast joint except for...great breakfasts.  The service was friendly, they have earlier hours than others in the neighborhood, comfortable atmosphere, decent drip coffee, etc.  Unfortunately, the food is about as unimaginative and bland as it gets.  I ordered the salmon omelette and it was served with raw yellow onions, a thin sliver of lox salmon and huge chunks of unmelted cream cheese. My son and his friend both ordered the \"big breakfast \" with three eggs, bacon, ham, sausage.  The scrambled eggs came out brownish - gray... I'm not sure how you do that.  The home fries looked like they came out of a frozen bag and warmed up for few minutes.    Others wrote about the great prices, but I don't get it. The salmon omelette was $14 and the big breakfasts were $12. You can get much better food at many other places in Montreal."}
{"text":"It's really not a place I would recommend. I get that it's cheap but you really don't even get what you pay for. I ordered a sandwich and the bread arrived burnt - when I asked the waitress if she could bring me a new one, the look I got made me want to blend away into the wall. She did however bring me a new sandwhich so yay - no wait a minute it was terrible even with un-charred bread.

There was also an insect crawling on the floor (gross) and a hair in my friend's burger. 

Safe to say I'm not going back. Not really sure why the ratings are so good."}
{"text":"This is the classic neighborhood diner. Food and décor are simple. Prices are affordable. Service comes with a smile and sometimes some sass - but coffee is unlimited and food is prepared quickly. This is no fancy, preppy brunch café. But Place Milton is a filling, comfortable and affordable way to catch up with friends!"}
{"text":"Place Milton is the best cheap brunch you can get in Montreal.

The place gets very busy, but i was lucky enough to live right next door so never had to wait.

Portions are huge for the $7 you'll spend with a tip. 

It's the best sunday hangover meal you can possibly get."}
{"text":"Great diner type food.  You get a good amount.  The waitresses were very kind to the eyes.

Nothing else to say - come if you're in the neighborhood and want some great typical breakfast/brunch items, but don't make a trip out of it if you're in Laval."}
{"text":"If I could sum up Place Milton in one word it would be this: reliable. No matter the day of the week or the weather outside, this institution in the heart of the McGill Ghetto will deliver a homemade and satisfying breakfast, over and over and over again. 

The eggs are always yolky, the potatoes perfectly hashed, and the sausages butterflied. Its consistency and familiarity haven't changed in the decade I've lived in this city, and even if I take a year between visits, it feels as though time hasn't passed. It's basically a breakfast black hole. 

Great little patio in the back too."}
{"text":"Gras et ordinaire. Le restaurant est situé à deux pas de chez moi (mais je préfère me rendre près du Square St-Louis, là où plusieurs endroits offrent brunchs dignes de ce nom). Les prix sont exagérés, l'espresso n'est certainement pas ce pourquoi on se déplace. La serveuse est plus souvent qu'autrement débordée. On place le maximum de personnes dans un minimum d'espace. Non, je n'y ferai pas la queue."}
{"text":"Excellent rapport qualité prix!
Ambiance agréable.
À ne pas manquer lors d'un déjeuner, le pain doré l'excentrique!
Sans oublier un cuisinier qui adore les enfants."}
{"text":"An oasis for downtown breakfast eaters drying out in the sandpits of Cora's and Eggspectations and Ben and Florentine's ruining basic staples like eggs and bacon in impressive ways because let's face it, how it is possible to ruin eggs and bacon unless you just feel utter contempt towards farm animals.

It's a hole in the wall with your basic staples done right and cheap and greasy. It gives you hope. 

If only they weren't cash only. SQUARE SQUARE SQUARE https://squareup.com/ca/"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for at Place Milton. The breakfast is VERY standard and average but VERY cheap. If you want a standard breakfast like eggs &bacon for cheap, go here. If you are into more creative options, skip it."}
