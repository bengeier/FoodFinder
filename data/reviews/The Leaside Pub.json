{"text":"Appalling! We couldn't get into Local across the street, so went in on a whim. Don't let the updated exterior fool you. It's the same old dark & dingy place, reaking of spilled beer. There were families, eldery couples, middle-aged like us from the neighbourhood. Waitress said that everything was 'awesome' after each order. Well, it truly was not awesome. She said the bartender made the best Cosmo she had ever had - bleh - sickly sweet, no lime. Nothing on the menu appealed to us - same old, same old pub staples, cooked from frozen. We opted for  a couple of the specials. Ribs & wings for my husband, with fries so salty they were inedible. Ribs were grey, no flavour, with BBQ sauce spread on top (Kraft no doubt). I ordered the pork stir fry special. The pork was cooked beyond recognition - yesterday's leftovers I think - a glob of noodles, with teriyaki sauce from a jar, and nary a vegetable to be found. The chef should be embarassed to serve food like that. We can seriously say we will never, ever eat there again."}
{"text":"We arrived at the pub on a sunny weekday in July hoping to have lunch on the patio, but we were told it was closed because of construction. Sitting inside was pretty dark and not overly welcoming. We were pretty annoyed that when we were just about done our meal a few other people asked to be seated on the patio, for some reason the patio was magically no longer under construction. I can understand if they had it closed because they didn't have the staff to cover it, but don't lie and then open it for others.
The menu looked like standard pub fare and they had some specials. It was a little pricey, but we figured it must be decent. The food was immensely disappointing, not much flavour, and it tasted cheaply and quickly prepared. The food was what you would expect to find in a cafeteria or worse. I wouldn't be surprised if it was microwaved. 
We left there feeling like we paid typical Toronto prices for hospital food.

The waiter we had was nice and responsive, but it wasn't enough to leave us with anything but regret for the whole experience."}
{"text":"I like the Leaside. The owner is a decent chap. The staff are friendly and the food is good, just like the beer. The wings are excellent and the warm chicken salad is healthy and delicious! It's not fancy, but it's relaxing and a good sports pub too."}
{"text":"Service OK on the slow side. 
Food was horrible, almost like everything was from frozen, no taste. Not very clean, weird smell in the air. 
Wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Quick front door seating service. Drink was ordered and brought to table quickly. Servers are polite. But i ordered a simple garden salad which also came out quickly. Almost too quickly even for a salad. Upon arrival i saw a piece of \"wilted\" lettuce, so i removed it, only to move other pieces around to find so many more. I continued removing them as the waitress watched and passed by at least 3 times without saying a word. Finally the waitress asked if everything was ok, i told her no this salad is disgusting. She replied with \"is it too wilted for your taste?\" I said \"it's too wilted for anyone's taste...it's rotting\" i said this kitchen is missing quality control and that it should not have made out the kitchen... \"it SHOULD be too wilted for the CHEF'S standards...it shouldn't ever reach the customer looking like that. Makes me wonder how well they are taking care of the kitchen. But drinks were good."}
{"text":"The garlic bread with cheese and the seafood platter I ordered were good. The fish was a bit overcooked though. My issue was all the little kids under the age of 15 running around making a lot of noise while their parents were too lazy to control them. 3 stars."}
{"text":"I used to go to this pub for 2 years with my sports team. Friendly atmosphere, reasonable. Priced food. Not great, but ok. I went with friends for lunch, only to see a cochroach walking on the ledge. 
When I mentioned it to a waitress she mentioned they have been dealing with them for 3 years. And when ever they fumigate and spray they come back. We left and wont be returning anymore."}
{"text":"Want a place to go after playing late night basketball?  After 10pm, The Leaside Pub has 75 cent wings in my favourite Cajun flavour.  Pair that with a low calorie beer like Molson 67 for $5 and you're all set.  BTW, the onion rings are really good here but I didn't order a batch this time.  Lots of TV screens to keep you tuned to the sporting event in progress like Raptors, Leafs, TFC, or even darts.  Servers are great and attentive!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is formerly the Fox and the Fiddle....Food is  expensive, bland and with no flavour or spices...I had no lemon or cocktail sauce served with Calamari.. This is my first time here with 2 other guests.  Would I recommend this place for Food?  The answer is no.   I would say this is a great place to meet people and have a beer.....Food? Forget it..Fire the chef.... I had to beg for salt and pepper.  Service mediocre...."}
{"text":"No frills pub with decent but not exciting food. Prices are reasonable and it's dependable in terms of service and quality. Burger, flat breads are usual go to favourites. Daily specials offer good value and big portions. It's not gourmet but if you set your standards appropriately they seldom disappoint."}
{"text":"First, let me address other reviews:

There is salt an pepper at every table, no exceptions. So, no idea what that's about.

The food is not special, just average. But it's cheap. $9 for eggs Benny, $3 cheaper than anywhere else in the area, and just as good.

Service is good, good is good, hell even the coffee isn't bad. Give this place a shot, it's great value, and you shan't regret it."}
{"text":"Went with family.  Nice atmosphere and very good service. Two had surf and turf and was fairly good. Husband and I ordered wings. Some were burned and all were over cooked and dry. Fries were really good. Probably won't go back."}
