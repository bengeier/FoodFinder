{"text":"Best Thai in town. Had the Pad, and instantly understood the name: It's a rural, Ma-Pa type of place making amazing food with fresh ingredients, right here in the city!"}
{"text":"Doesn't look ver special from the outside but they have super friendly service, awesome food and seemed to be happy to make me vegan Pad Thai which is a big plus!
Also very budget friendly."}
{"text":"I first came here a few weeks ago because I read all these great reviews about the restaurant and it's cheap lunch specials, ($4.99 for green curry??, can't get any better than that!). Since I'm such a thai food fiend I had to check it out and see whether the quality was up to snuff given the gross underpricing - If you guys aren't aware, green curry normally goes for over $10!  So I did - got the green curry chicken with pad thai, naturally :), and though the portion sizes were not very large, for $4.99 I'm really not complaining. Quality-wise, it surpassed a lot of thai restaurants or 'make-shift' thai restaurants out there charging $10 for the same thing, or less than what i got, because really, who includes pad thai for $4.99 anyways? I've definitely never seen that type of generosity. The lady at the desk, who was also serving me was super nice and very friendly and smiley - I'm a server as well so I really appreciate when people have a good demeanor and \"work\" for their tip, so to speak. And generally I think for such a low price point, a lot of servers would not be so motivated to sing for their tip... 

The 2nd visit which was today actually, I ordered one of the lunch express specials, the spicy chicken with rice and asked for extra spicy. I find that whenever I order extra spicy at restaurants it's never as spicy as I want it to be, maybe because many restauranteurs fear over-doing it, which as a result would potentially lead to less repeat customers.. But to add more praise for Thai Country Kitchen, the chicken was really spicy, just how I like it (think, eating raw chilies SPICY) and I know this because I didn't need to add any additional spice on top of it. On top of that I asked the same lady that served me the first time, (I'm guessing she owns the place), for some peanuts on the side, and she was happy to oblige, though my meal was a meager $5.99. Many other asian restaurants would have taken that opportunity to add an extra dollar or two for that same condiment. I know this because I've been to asian restaurants all my life due to being born into asianness lol. 

In general, the food here seems authentic and much better price-wise and quality-wise than many \"thai\" restaurants I have tried since moving downtown. 

If you want to try thai, it's a great place to start and to leave a great impression for any future endeavors into thai cuisine. Promise!"}
{"text":"I went in for lunch today expecting great authentic thai food.

It smells bad and the seating is cheap diner. I figured the food must be amazing with all of these reviews.

Mediocre at best, I had the spicy noodles and my boyfriend tried the basil stir fry. Carrots and cauliflower? Cheap filler veg, not Thai. I ate it, it wasn't bad, but I was no where near wow'd. 

I would only recommend if someone was looking for something really cheap."}
{"text":"Decor could use a make over, but the food here is great and service too. i'm happy to see that they are around still  I usually go during lunch time so grab the specials, leave there with a full belly but my wallet isn't emptied out as the prices are great!"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ chicken but service took a while. Cosy spot and the lunch menu is great for quick meals."}
{"text":"Definitely a hole in the wall Thai restaurant. Basil stir fry was good, spice level was on point and the beer was cold.  Waitress was nice and attentive.

This place is probably great for takeout.

Not really a date or family spot, but good Thai food nonetheless."}
{"text":"Loved this place !!!! I visited Thailand  last year and this restaurant is the real deal. The food taste very authentic. The service is great and the prices are good as well.  The decor is average but the amazing food makes up for it. I had the pineapple curry as well as the pad Thai. They also have lunch specials for $6.99. This place is amazing :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for Thai food in Chinatown of Toronto. The price is reasonable and much less expensive than other heavily decorated Thai restaurant. I have been a frequent customer since 2009. For a date, I don't recommend as the ambiance is not designed for a date. But to have a good time and hang out with friends and family, this is a legit choice. Their food option might not be very numerable but it captures Thai food fairly well."}
{"text":"Randomly selected this place based on the closest Thai place near me. It was a toss up but I'm glad it landed on Thai Country Kitchen. 
I know my Pad Thai and this one was exceptional. Delightful service and both meals were above expectations. I would gladly recommend this place with confidence. Looking forward to ordering from here as well since they are partnered with \"Just Eat\".
Happy eating!! :)"}
{"text":"They have a good pad Thai and it's a friendly atmosphere with a nice layout."}
{"text":"Delicious food and wonderfully service! Try the panama curry! Pad seew is also great!"}
{"text":"A very down to earth Thai restaurant in Chinatown, authentic yet not pricey. It is a family owned restaurant and that brings back memories of my time in Thailand. The Thai owner is super friendly. Rarely any Thai restaurants offer Pad See Eiw Noodles in Toronto and I was thrilled to order it.  It is rice noodles glazed with egg, topped with veggies flavoured with Thai sweet soy sauce  Also, the complimentary treats you get as dessert are truly tasty."}
{"text":"It's our first day in Canada (we were on a 2 week Canadian tour) and my sister & I ventured out undeterred by the pouring rain.  We stayed at the U. of Toronto and walked along Spadina Avenue where lots of restaurants seemed appealing at first glance but upon closer scrutiny of the menus, the prices were outside our tight budget (after all, the Canadian $ is slightly stronger than the U.S. $).  We were hungry but were determined to find something within our means.

Just as we were on the verge of succumbing to fast food, we fortunately found ourselves lured in by the alarmingly affordable prices at Thai Country Kitchen.  Coming from NYC, anything below $10 per dish at a Thai restaurant is considered decent by my standards.

It was empty when we entered but we went during off hours (around 3pm) and it was also a weekday.  I ordered a spicy basil fried rice and my sister got a spicy noodle with vegetables/tofu.  We were both satisfied with the taste of our food and were stuffed by the end.  In terms of service, the waiter refilled our water but generally went back to the counter in the back of the restaurant and did his own thing.  He wasn't always attentive but he wasn't horrendous.

Cheap, good flavors and okay service.  Not too shabby for a Thai place in Canada!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of real Thai food and this place ranks among the best I've ever tried... Friendly staff and good food for an honest price... When we came in the place was empty so it was a bit of a gamble, but as we we eating this delicious food, other patrons entered. From their conversation it was clear that they were returning visitors... Always a good sign..."}
{"text":"Huge portion and authentic Thai food with price under 10. The place is run by people who are from Thailand. Enjoy the cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ordered Pad Thai and chicken with basil sauce. Food was really good and I would say it was authentic Thai food. The server was friendly and kind. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Two of us came here for dinner. From start to finish, the staff were incredibly kind and attentive. We had the cold spring rolls as an app, and they were delicious, plus 8 pieces meant we didn't need to fight over them! Then we had the coconut soup and the wonton soup. The coconut soup was one of the best I've had in the city. We each had the pad Thai and it was simple yet delicious. Big portions, so we each took home leftovers. Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really wonderful Thai food. The Panang curry and yellow curry are both outstanding, and I recently tried their fish cake appetizer for the first time which were so good! I love the friendly and attentive service, though the decor leaves a bit to be desired. The food is consistently outstanding, really good value, and the complimentary treats you get as dessert are sure tasty."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious, full flavour Thai food! 
Not to mention the budget friendly and affordable prices, you cannot go wrong with the lunch and dinner combos for $5/$7. 

Nim, the main hostess and waitress is super friendly and always has a smile on her face! 

I have referred dozens of friends here...it's a gem in Toronto!"}
{"text":"No Reservation required. The restaurant is located in Chinatown. Excellent Green Curry Chicken and Pad Thai.  Both dishes are very good.  This place is run by owners from Thailand, so you're getting the real deal here. The place needs some renovation though.  Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for lunch and at first look, it's quite dingy and dark. 

Regardless, my friend wanted to eat here so we decided to check out their lunch menu.  I ordered the curry chicken with pad thai.  

The curry was delicious and had a great coconut flavour.  I typically can't take too much heat in my food but it had the perfect amount of spiciness.  The pad thai was also pretty simple but delicious.  

My dish only cost $4.99 which is a steal for eating lunch downtown.  For the very reasonable price, I got some pretty good tasting food, albeit slightly small portion, but how can I complain when it was only 5 bucks? Definitely would come back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Thai Express has a better pad thai for the same price and the portion is bigger. Service is mediocre. When the owner (lady) is serving is much better than the rude waiter. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Went here because of the reviews and the location is walking distance from our hotel. The place did not disappoint. We had the appetizer plate, the green curry and the pad thai. My wife and I had to switch plates cause the green curry was a bit too spicy for her, but perfect for me. It was delicious. Very glad we didn't skip the appetizers too. We'll be trying to recreate the salad back home in Columbus. The service was excellent. Got to know the owner, she lived in thailand and is very nice."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for a quick study break lunch, and I must say that the pricing system was a hit! 

Food:

I got the Tamarind Tofu Pad Thai and my friend got the Chicken Pad Thai both of which were tasty and filling. 
Student budgeting + $5 lunch = Awesome!!
2 stars

Service:
Single young man acting as cashier and wait staff - typical asian restaurant.
Surprisingly attentive kept the water topped up and wasn't pushy at all.
1.5 stars

The restaurant was empty at the time which was strange at 12:30 on a Thursday, but I wonder if there is a better time? Also wasn't sure if they took credit as I wasn't given the option though I know that other reviewers have said that they do so I'll check it out next time."}
{"text":"Cheap!  Where else can you feed 4 people for less than $30 at lunch?!!  well besides McD's. :)

If you order the combo for $5.99 you get soup, spring roll and entree. For $4.99 you get just the entree but it comes with rice.

We came for the lunch special on a Saturday morning around 12:30pm - we were the only ones there but some people did come in later.

They were very accommodating in serving the rice separately from our combo plates as we wanted to share from everyones dishes.  We had pad thai, curry chicken and ginger beef.  We had non spicy but next time I will try for spicy.

The dinner prices looked reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I ordered through Uber at 12:18 and the food didn't arrive till 1:30, most of the time showed it being prepared in the kitchen, that's fine, it's lunch time, cut them some slack for taking this long. 

The pad Thai, red curry and Thai coconut soup was average, and the basil chicken was horrendous. The vegetable and the chicken already changed colours from being soaked in the broth ( wayyyy too much broth) for so long and the content didn't even fill 2/3 of the box. It looked and tastes worse than home- cooked stir fry chicken. I am greatly disappointed."}
{"text":"We randomly walked into this restaurant at 9:30pm on a Wednesday night expecting them to turn us away as it was only half an hour from closing time. The waitress was inviting and told us we can sit an order anything and promptly got us our menus. Its a very casual dining atmosphere with lovely interior decoration with art work and artifacts I've seen in Thailand during my trip there. I ordered a basic shrimp pad thai and it arrived pretty quickly and was very flavorful. The tamarind sauce they used had tasted fresh and the noodles were well cooked. The portion size is huge and I was barely able to finish it as I was very hungry at that point in the evening but I wouldn't be able to do so normally. 
So overall a great place that serves decent Thai food, large portions and budget friendly prices."}
{"text":"Has to be one of my favourite places to get Thai food downtown now!! Very small place but big flavours and unreal food! I had the veggie pad Thai lunch special which was $8 and came with a veggie spring roll. It was better than most Thai places I've been to and tasted traditional and homemade. Seems like a family owned place but the staff were very nice. Decor could use an update but nonetheless the food is amazing. It's just outside of Kensington in Chinatown so is a short walk to an amazing part of Toronto as well!! Would recommend to anyone looking for good Thai food in Toronto"}
{"text":"Ordered from here for a company party, with around 30-40 attendees. I called in the day before to place the order and ask for recommendations. The person on the phone was very helpful and even offered to provide complimentary snacks and extra rice. 

Delivery was on time, and people kept asking me where I ordered the food from! The dishes were flavourful (although a bit salty - but this was expected from restaurant food). The curry puffs, veggie green curry, spicy eggplant with crispy fish, and basil lamb stir-fry were hits. Overall great party food for a decent price."}
{"text":"They're shut down,  don't waste time parking. Sign says closed for renovation. Beware!!"}
{"text":"Great place , good food and reasonable price. We ordered 4 dished and all tastes fantastic. Sure recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Thai food. The pricing is awesome and the food is delicious. It is not a over the top restaurant. Just a nice simple place to sit and have a good meal. The place is well kept and clean. 
I also would like to mention that the lady who owns(i think) the place is a really awesome person and very genuine. She will try her best to make it a good experience for you. Don't forget to try the sweet cracker like thing . It is amazing."}
{"text":"Having made our way through the dirt of Chinatown, we were welcomed and served by the friendly and humble owner. The cold rolls, the hot and sour soup, the coconut soup, the pad thai and the green, yellow and red curry (we were hungry and in for some color that day) all tasted wonderful. 

This, dear Torontonians, is what this city is missing most: true culinary authenticity. Honest dishes, made as in their home country. On a side-note: you won't find any cheaper than this without being poisoned. 

Four stars, because this is the best Thai in town I have visited so far."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch, and it was so cheap!! $15 for TWO people!  We ordered off the lunch menu, and the food came quickly.  I ordered the green curry, and it was pretty good, but not the best I've tasted.  However, it is really good for the price!!  It's really close to the university, so It's a good place to go for a quick lunch.  We were in an out of there in less than 45 minutes.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Cozy little Thai restaurant in Chinatown that my co-workers and I tired. I ordered the Kao Soy wish was alright - didn't find the yellow curry creamy enough and there was a serious lack of vegetable (3 pieces of broccoli, flower shaped carrots and cabbage) and a handful of chicken. It was $6.99 and comes with a spring roll - nothing special to be honest. 

I did not like the fact that I came out of the restaurant smelling like it - I have this thing about smelling like food and seriously felt that I was walking around with a stench of food trailing me (gross). 

Overall, I did not particularly enjoy this place. I would not come back."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype.

Food was not memorable, and there's definitely better in Chinatown, for the same price range. Ambiance is also awkward, but my main disappointment lies in the lackluster food.

I would hold onto that $10, unless you're broke, tired, and starving for Thai."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food, sorta dumpy location  these hole in the wall places are sometimes the best though! Their curry puff appetizer was excellent! The Tom yum was just ok, the pad Thai was good, the spring rolls were great! Calamari was great! Food was reasonably priced and service was decent! Overall I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I've been back a handful of times and each time, their food has been excellent.  Their green curry is superlative with a good amount of heat and their coconut sticky rice goes perfectly with it.  I've also tried their spicy noodles and pad see eew (they spell it differently on their menu) and both were very tasty dishes.  Definitely one of the better places in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Yay for thai food. Their curries (green and panang) are a bit spicy but rich tasting. Friendly service everytime. My favourite thing from this place is the twisty sweet crunchy fritters they give at the end on the house. For lunch I usually get the combo, its cheap and satisfying."}
{"text":"It's a great place with a very friendly service. The food is a lot better than in some of the other, more expensive places in the city."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious Thai with a fantastically friendly hostess who chatted with us amiably after a twelve hour drive to Toronto from Illinois.  Eleven awesome points for her; the food was wonderful and the decor was cute.  Also, how can you not love a place called Thai Country Kitchen.  Delightful, that's what it is.  Delightful."}
{"text":"I've lived downtown for how long and I've never been to this place?!

Authentic Thai food.  No bells and whistles here.  It's real home cooking.  

If you go to the usual places just off of King St. W., you're honestly paying about 50% more (if not almost double) for something very similar.  Sure, the decor isn't screaming for Instagram but if you want very reasonably priced Thai dishes, I strongly recommend giving this place a try.  

Shrimp in a pepper sauce served with rice.  Delicious.  8 nice sized shrimp. 

Pad see eew with beef. Very good flavour.

Pad Thai with chicken.  A little heavy on the sauce.  A little short on bean sprouts and chives.  Definitely add a sprinkling of some chilli peppers and a squish of lime.  

Portions are not huge, but again, very fair prices.  I'd definitely come back!

Pro tip: Do ask for chilli peppers and hot sauce.  It doesn't seem like they add any heat directly in their dishes.  We sprinkled the dry flakes onto the pad thai and it made a big difference!"}
{"text":"Decent Massaman curry and good prices, but the noodles gave my partner pretty serious food poisoning."}
{"text":"I love this place!, unassuming, low key mom and pop type restaurant with dynamite food, Pad Thai is spot on, perfectly balanced, and i like the fact the bean sprouts are stir fried in and not raw, i was in Bangkok and Phuket Thailand and I've never seen them served raw like they usually are here. Their Thai beef salad is perfection, Thai room uses salad dressing, no mint, very uninspired lol, this is the real deal, shallots, chillies, lime juice, mint, so fresh and delicious, made the right way. Portions here are excellent, and these guys charge a very fair price for their food, Bangkok Garden i'm looking at you! $16.95 for pad Thai?? Are you insane? If it was better than Thai Country kitchen, maybe... but I've had it, and it's no match... and it's definitely not worth $16.95 lol. But i digress,,, this place is fantastic, GREAT Thai food, their chef is excellent. This is my go to Thai food resto, very consistent, very delicious..."}
{"text":"Very good food, selection and service. I had the chili veggie lunch special, great lunch portion too!"}
{"text":"Service was fast! Food was great! What more can you ask for? 

They even give you a little dessert thing when you finish."}
{"text":"Tom yam was a fail, yellow curry was delicious. interior is worse than nearby chinese restaurants. If give it 2.5 stars if I could. But its def not enough for 3 stars. Piecewise its cheap, but quality of good is not good"}
{"text":"5.99 dinner special and it's delicious, now that is something to yelp about!
This family run joint is amazing, don't be fooled by the lack of patrons or the divey feel, this place serves class and amazing thai food. They are super veggie friendly and everything I ate was amazing (Thai spicy eggplant with spring roll, soup and dessert).
If you are in Spadina China town and feeling a bit peckish, stop by this place and you will not be disappointed. And if for some reason you are, then it won't hurt your wallet, so don't fret."}
{"text":"12:30 lunch for three on a Monday.
Ate at the restaurant. Rating does not take into account take-out or delivery options.

There were two other tables of guests, but it was raining heavily outside so that may have had an impact.

Interesting decor. Lots of things to see: cultural paintings and statues neatly arranged all over the place. Huge mirror lining along one side of the wall so that you can admire yourself while you eat.

Fork and knife is available. No chopsticks provided, but perhaps they may be requested (I suppose this is normal for a Thai place).

Lunch specials are available from 11 AM to 3 PM, ranging from $5.99 to $7.99. Ordered the Pad Thai Noodles with Chicken for $7.59. Portion size was decent and the taste was enjoyable (based purely on whether I liked it or not; I do not consider \"authenticity\")

All lunch specials come with a spring roll. The one I received was a fried vegetarian spring roll. It was great; nice and crispy. I think one of our party didn't receive one...but likely it was gone before I even noticed.

Overall, it was a good experience. I would recommend it if you're looking for a budget meal."}
{"text":"So happy to have stumbled across this place. Thai Country Kitchen is a gem in the middle of Chinatown! After a day of exploring Toronto, my friend and I were exhausted and hardcore craving pad thai. Their chicken pad thai was some of the best I've ever had. The portions are huge and the staff is very friendly. If I didn't live in America, this would be my go-to takeout spot."}
{"text":"$4.99 for lunch special? Omg it was amazing. The food was tasty, nothing too extravagant, but it was pretty authentic except for the fact that they use broccoli and carrots (which you don't normally put them in curry in Thai cuisine. The staff were very friendly and attentive. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here after work with a couple of colleagues around 6. Ordered the pad Thai and it tasted very authentic, a little on the sweet side but the sauce was delicious nevertheless and chicken and noodle texture were perfect.

The waitress was very attentive and friendly, and were given complimentary dessert after our meal! Great place, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Authentic thai and chill place with pleasant people."}
{"text":"This place is as closed to real Thai food as it gets! Price is very good for the food!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, great environment. And of course! Amazing and freshly prepared thai food, great value. If you want a quick, hot, fresh and cheap meal downtown. This is your place. Quality far exceeds that of any neighbouring Chinese restaurants, and the care"}
{"text":"Super glad this place stays open until 10:00 pm on Sundays because my buddies and I were craving Thai but most in the area closed earlier.

We decided to get a few dishes to share among each other. We got the pad thai, pineapple fried rice, and the spicy eggplant with crispy fish (which was suggested to us by our lovely waitress).

Pad thai and pineapple fried rice were great but I was really impressed by the spicy eggplant crisy fish. It was very very tasty, especially the fish. 

Portions were good. All three of us were satisfied. And plus great service!

Looking forward to try again when I'm back in Toronto."}
{"text":"We had the chicken and shrimp satays and it was beyond delish (pro tip: ask for double peanut sauce). I was surprised that we were the only people in there, given some of the reviews on here. I'd go back again, but it wouldn't be top of my list."}
{"text":"Very nice (family run?) restaurant. The lunch special is obviously amazing. The service is terrific. It's a shame that not many visit this place (compared to, say, Simon's Sushi or Pho Hung or the two dumpling houses), since the food is decent and the price is in the same range."}
{"text":"Let's summarize that this place as a \"hole in the wall\" that offers decent and authentic Thai food.   We ordered a three person combo for $28 along with a few other items which ended up being too much food.

Ambiance is a bit dated, parking is a chore (we got lucky after fighting for a spot on Spadina) but at least the food and service experience was good.

If you are looking for affordable and authentic Thai food without the \"extras\" in a no frills environment, this is a worth considering."}
{"text":"Authentic thai for you right here.
I have recommended many many of my friends here and they all love it!
I always get their lunch combo special for $6.99:
hot and sour soup with curry or basil pad thai with a spring roll.

It is the BEST here!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come from Seattle, where mediocre Thai places are a dime a dozen, and where there are more than a few Thai places I would call great. I might be prepared to say that Thai Country Kitchen blows them all out of the water. 
The food here is executed SO well. The flavors are just right, and everything tastes super authentic. Phad See Ew is my fave, and it's a pretty simple dish, but when it's done right it can be amazing. They do it SO RIGHT here. 
Everything we ate was delicious. There weren't really any duds, and we have a habit of drastically over-ordering when we eat Thai, so we ate a good array of stuff. 
They don't ask you how spicy you want anything, but everything we got had just the right amount of spice to it. If you like it really spicy I guess you can ask for it, per an earlier review. 
The atmosphere is kind of dingy, and the presentation is super simple, but the food more than makes up for it. I'll take dingy simply-plated delicious over fancy-looking mediocrity (I'm looking at you, Seattle) any day."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We had gotten a little tired of Sukho Thai family of restaurants and had been on the lookout for other authentic Thai dishes. After being disappointed at a few other restaurants, we tried this place and were pleasantly surprised. You get the usual pad Thai and curries but we really enjoyed the glass noodle salad and Pad Ka Prao (spicy minced meat dish). Both were really enjoyable, favorable and unique. Would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Tasty food, decent service but a bit dated in its decor. Can't complain after looking up this spot for nearby Thai food."}
{"text":"As I was looking for a place to eat dinner, I saw an ad on yelp for this restaurant and decided to try it out. I've never trusted yelp ads but decided to give it a go since I was super hungry. The owner was SUPER nice and sweet and welcomed me. I asked for the bowl of noodles I saw on yelp and he immediately knew what I was taking about. 

I got a bowl of egg noodles with dumplings, meatballs, pork slices, and bean sprouts. The broth was very flavourful but not too greasy. The noodles were thin and chewy. Overall it was delicious and cheap! The owner made me feel super welcomed and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"It's a family run Thai place, perfect for when you're craving some comfort food. Portion sizes are large and it's plenty for lunch and for dinner. Their pad thai and spring rolls are my go-to's, but you can't go wrong with any of their lunch/dinner specials either. Service is attentive and prompt and their staff is super friendly for eat-in and take-out meals."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day to test out the many positive reviews for myself. Thai Country Kitchen is located amongst a sea of East Asian restaurants and a stone throw away from Kensington market. 

I had the very decent Ginger Tofu with rice.Though the sauce was sweet the bursts of ginger were delicious. All in all, this is a solid place to come if you want a super cheap lunch, with waiter service though I'm not sure if the experience will made me not question another return."}
{"text":"Great service. Staffs are nice and caring. I wanted to have light dinner and ordered shrimps tom yam gon soup with noodle. The staff explained to me my combination might be out of my expectation and would be different from other tom yam gon noodle soup. The soup is good, sour and little spicy. Made me wanna to eat more! I will come again with friends and try other dishes! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch specials .
Chicken pad Thai, cashew nut chicken +++
Bathroom needs a paint job, patch the various holes better. Upstairs could also use some modernization, creating a more appealing space/interior."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in Toronto. It is very authentic. It is not only typical Thai food menu here, also some special menu that Thai people might look for... I had Somtum, grilled chicken, calamari and Tom Zap--amazing ... worth the money.. will go back again for sure. love the taste.."}
{"text":"Real deal Thai food. I don't know what else to say. 
Just tell them you want 'thai spicy' and you will get food the way its served in Thailand. 

Just make sure you bring your beer with you to drown the spices as they don't have a liquor licence."}
{"text":"I like this place, good foods and price is great. They have great value lunch special menu. Also vegetarian options. I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Decided I would try out this Thai food since it A) was close to where I wanted to live in Toronto (maybe my new joint?) and B) it delivered to my hotel!  

Took FOREVER to get to us but I don't really have anything to base this delivery off of since I have only ordered delivery like twice in Toronto, and I'm suspecting delivering to a hotel is even harder.

The food itself was so meh.  I should have known based on the price.  The pad thai noodles were more like thai spaghetti, the pad see ew had an off smell to it, the curry was strange and unappetizing.  Fried tofu was soggy but that could be from delivery. 

The best thing we had were their fresh rolls!  Actually maybe some of the better fresh rolls I have tasted.  However, I would never order from here again as the rest of the meal just did not stand up."}
{"text":"I have only tried pad thai. It tasted horrible. Eating it was torture.

Thai princess / Khao San road / PAI are way better."}
{"text":"The decor is terrible, the service decent, and the food likewise merely decent. The salad rolls are good, though. Not much to say other than lacklustre thai food, but at least it's better than Thai Express."}
{"text":"Very good food, super great service and reasonable price! We tried pad thai, kao soy and green curry and all of them were so great! Definitely will come back :)"}
{"text":"MUST TRY:
Pad Thai. (very legit. it's made with Tamarind, no ketchup)
Massaman curry lamb

Good:
Golden curry


Don't be fooled by the strange name and stale decor. The food is tasty.

This is one of the best value meals in the city, with most main dishes priced around $10.

Obviously this is not the place to come if you're trying to impress someone with ambience, but everything else about the service is excellent.

Not sure what more you can ask for at this price point. BUT..... I remain somewhat skeptical about them considering their inconsistent dinesafe history."}
{"text":"You know those places that you never really look at, but you pass by them somewhat frequently and even though they don't look like much you eventually just walk in to see what's up with the place? This place was that! We wanted thai and this was the closest place and we were not disappointed. Portion size is good, not overly glutinous but definitely enough to make us full without exploding. We got the Beef Pad Sew and the Chicken Pad thai, will definitely be trying the curry next. Beef was REALLY GOOD like reallllllllyyy good. Seasoned just amazingly and really tender. Noodles were not really oily like some places. 
Would return when I need a cheap, good quality thai meal :)"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Sunday and the place was literally deserted which suited us just fine. The decor is dated but other than that the food was very tasty and the service was very friendly. If you're looking for a good fairly inexpensive, unpretentious Thai fix, this is a good place."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends. Wasn't my choice, but I never have any trouble with trying new restaurants.

The Good:
- Food was pretty good, above average for Thai food. I would say that it had a home cooked aesthetic/taste that other Thai places lack. 

The Bad: 
- Service was poor, the server forgot multiple parts of our order. She also brought out the wrong thing and seemed really disappointed that we wanted the fried rice that we ordered. 
- The timing of our food was off, significant periods of time between dishes being brought out. 
- The atmosphere was lacking. No music playing (which is eerie when you're eating at a restaurant). The place also smelled musty.

The Ugly:
- Bathroom was almost umbearable. They put moth balls in the urinal which gave the entire mens room such an unpleasent, overpowering odour.  

I wouldn't say no if someone planned a group dinner there, but I might suggest an alternative. The good food is almost worth putting up with the bad service and the depressing atmosphere, but there are alternatives that are much better."}
{"text":"Great little Thai sport whose prices average about 25% less than most Thai restaurants.  The food was terrific, sufficiently spicey as other reviewers mentioned and also not as much sugar as in most Thai places, which I assume is more authentic.  Tom Kha was nice and citrus-ey with lots of lemon grass and my beef with eggplant main dish was spicy and had a great flavour.

Service (all of the folks seemed to be young people when we were there) was friendly and very pleasant.

As other reviewers mention, ignore the slightly down-at-the heels building - it means nothing."}
{"text":"Delivery order through Foodora.

They understand what vegan means and will prepare without eggs and fish sauce.

We ordered:

- spring rolls
- cold rolls
- pad thai
- pad see ew
- basil fried rice
- panang curry

Everything was really good but I especially liked the pad thai and curry. Heat level was mild (I didn't specify) so I'd definitely specify next time. Will order again!"}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Thai Country Kitchen is located in Chinatown, which is losing its China and is evolving to an \"East Asia\" Town with the abundance of Japanese, Vietnamese, and Thai places. The outside looks a little bit sketchy, but the inside has a decent traditional feel.

Their lunch specials are very affordable and are definitely worth the price you pay. I had the pad thai noodles with chicken, which is the standard order for me when I'm dining alone for lunch. Their lunch specials come with a single piece of spring roll.

The spring roll was quite good, definitely of excellent value considering the affordable price as is (under $10 for the entire meal). The pad thai came after, and while I overall enjoyed it, I felt the noodles were slightly undercooked. I like it chewy, but I should not be feeling portions of noodles that felt indifferent from the dry bags you buy from grocery stores. However, the portions were excellent.

Service was excellent, and the employees really try to make sure everyone is satisfied with their food. For under $10, this is probably one of the best Thai places out there, and I wouldn't hesitate on returning here."}
{"text":"Despite a dodgy exterior and decor, I decided to trust my fellow yelpers' reviews and I wasn't disappointed! Neither were my parents who were having lunch with me. The place is clean, the food is very good and the prices are low! The service is a little slow, but time flies in good company, so I didn't really mind it. I highly recommend it. I'll definitely go back! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Typical older establishment in Chinatown - old and dusty. Stay away from the pad Thai. Green curry was mediocre and the ginger chicken was average. The calamari appetizer was surprisingly good. Tom yum soup was lacklustre.  Food cane fast but that's the first and last time you will see the server.  The coconut mango sticky rice was decent. Portion size was all very small making the price relatively high."}
{"text":"Been here with coworkers couple times before, never disjointed before.  Today I went by myself before my evening meeting and ordered the chicken Pad Thai. The portion is on the bigger side, a little bit too sweet today for my taste but the chicken tasted great. I love the environment here, quiet with soft folk song playing in the background, The food is authentic too, I think they are real Thai people, great place to get some inexpensive delicious Thai food. 

P.S. Their coconut ice cream is fantastic."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious! I wish their portions were slightly bigger. 

The place is nothing fancy at all but the food is really good and the service is great! It's one of my usual spots!"}
{"text":"The Food is amazing, I had the Green curry chicken with sticky rice and 4 shrimp egg rolls with dipping sauce.
The spice had just enough bite to feel it but not burn. the spice was perfect.

The presentation is really good for this kind of place, it's low key establishment but you wouldn't know it seening how they sever your food.

A hidden gem for sure..."}
{"text":"To be honest, I didn't expect much from this Thai place when I initially walked in, but my friend recommended it and I was pleasantly surprised by how good the pad Thai was! Huge portion for around $8! Probably wouldn't order the spring rolls again, they were a bit dry, but the veggie pad Thai definitely sold me!"}
{"text":"For the price this place is amazing! I always order here from foodora and the food always arrives hot and fresh. I normally get either the red or green chicken curry (I suggest ordering an extra steamed rice the rice that comes with it is a bit small IMO), sweet and sour soup with tofu and veggies and pad thai.

Yum yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"I'm having trouble deciding if this place is good or bad.

I went there alone at around 8ish and nobody else was there. I said, whatever...it's Chinatown I'm sure people are just eating somewhere else today. 

I ordered the spring rolls and pad thai (vegetarian). The three spring rolls tasted unique, and in a good way too. The pad thai tasted weird. Maybe my thai cuisine experience has bordered too much on the North American variations but it didn't taste right. There was no tang from the tamarind. The only flavour was slightly fishy - which was neither good nor bad.

Everyone is friendly, but mostly doing their own thing. I got a free sweet snack with my bill which I thought was a nice touch and made up for my less that stellar pad thai. REALLY good portions though, I only ate half and I was stuffed."}
{"text":"I had a very satisfying post workout meal here thanks to Vivek's suggest!
The lunch deal is probably the best thai lunch deal in Toronto, and unbelievably runs until 5pm! There are 3 lunch menus with prices ranging from $5-8. 
Seeing as it was a first visit, we opted to try \"safe\" options and they did not disappoint. 
The pad thai in fact rates as one of the better ones I have had in recent memory and was capped with an array of tasty, colourful veggies!
Slight disappointment with the food was the tad saltiness and relatively low chicken:veggie volume, but you can't really complain about the latter for $5!! 
Also there is a good chance that our meals were pre-prepared considering how fast they came out, but the again you can't really complain.....!

Good cheap lunch option in the area if you feel like thai! Recommended"}
{"text":"My biggest problem with this place is the flies. So many of them. 
WTF

The pad thai was really tasty, but the beef was jerky.
The penang curry was mediocre at best, the chicken was also very hard.
Each dish was 8.95 (9.95 if you order the seafood version, 7.95 if you were vegetarian).

Service was good.

I wouldn't come back, due to the flies."}
{"text":"The service was superb and the mango salad was to die for! Prices are not super cheap as we didnt choose the dinner special but the price for pad thai was the same as everywhere else. Will definitely go back there again!"}
{"text":"I was craving Thai food and reviews from fellow Yelpers for Thai Country Kitchen convinced me to give this place a try. The purple storefront on the west side of Spadina is hard to miss, and like other restaurants on Spadina, it's sort of run down, the bathroom is in the basement (on the dirty side). The lunch menu had a good selection of pad thai, curry, rice and noodle dishes - I've uploaded photos of the menu. With prices under $8, you can't go wrong. I had the chicken pad thai and it came with a small vegetarian spring roll. The spring roll was delicious! Not too salty, super crunchy, wasn't refried, and was piping hot. My first bite of the pad thai was a bit disappointing. It was on the sweet side and lacked spice. Most other Thai restaurants let you choose the spice level, but they didn't even ask when I placed the order. I really liked the texture of the noodle - chewy but not undercooked. The amount of chicken and tofu pieces were proportional to the noodles. The other reviews of this restaurant were so good and I really want to like this place, but I can't. I guess for the lunch special price, I can't complain too much."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery through Just Eat. The food arrived promptly, came to about 30 dollars with two dishes and two apps. Not bad. 

The food: Really bad. The rice was watery, the peanut sauce woefully under-seasoned, and the pad thai was just blah. Also it gave my partner stomach issues.

Too bad."}
{"text":"The place was completely empty when we went on a Saturday night and it remained empty the whole time. The prices for the dinner special was cheap at 7 dollars for a Spring roll, a bowl of hot and sour soup, rice and an entree but the portions weren't enough for me. The soup was sour and didn't have much substance. 

The service was good and fast but probably because we were the only ones there. 

The place is decent to get a cheap quick grub but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai restaurant which makes an effort to - and succeeds at - being authentic. Having lived in East Asia for years and vacationed in Thailand, I've loved Thai food ever since I was kid. However, I've found, to my great distress and disappointment, that Thai restaurants in Canada are rarely authentic. Thai Country Kitchen, however, was awesome. I had the som tum (green papaya salad), which was all it should be, something rare in Canada, and nearly wept tears of joy when I tasted the pad thai, which did not use any tomato sauce and was very, very good.

While the decor isn't stellar, it still looked like a restaurant - and not one of questionably sanitary ones normal for Chinatown. In addition, the prices were cheap - the food totaled $16 and I still had more than enough left over for a hearty lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Good and clean. Pad Thai is pretty tasty, has tamarind sauce. 

Red curry was clean but lighter than some (less coconut milk). Mild spicy will be bland. Medium spicy may be too hot for you. Very spicy will make you cry. 

All the ingredients (vegetables, meats) are fresh and clean. Overall flavor was good. Not as good as what you can get in Thailand, but better than most in Toronto."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout through Uber eats. Sooooo good. I ordered the green curry with chicken and the vegetable spring rolls. Lots of chicken, vegetables that aren't overcooked, and legit veggies like broccoli and carrots not a pile of red and green peppers like most crappy Thai takeout. Granted thats obviously not autentic thai veg, but whatever it tasted good. Springrolls were incredibly crispy and delicious. RECOMMEND THIS PLACE INDEED."}
{"text":"I visited Thai Country Kitchen today for take out. Their $4.99 lunch special is an impossibly affordable deal. You can have either rice or pad thai, and choose your protein: beef or chicken (seasoned in a myriad of ways) or tofu. I placed an order to go and sat down.

The restaurant was empty as I waited, and smelled faintly of incense. I think it would be a pretty decent place to dine as it contains the requisite Siamese iconography and decor, and there is a fair bit of seating. I especially liked the raised table for two in the window. Sitting there I felt as though I was a mannequin on display.

Ten minutes later the food was ready, and I was impressed by the large portion, I zipped home and devoured the entire thing within minutes. A solid meal though honestly not the best I've ever had. But it was certainly filling and their prices are hard to beat. I'll come back to try dinner sometime.

Obligatory Title Pun: THAI to find a cheaper lunch.

Menu Readability: Simple laminated one-pager in a times font, punctuated with hints of purple, red and green text.

Need to mention: They accept debit and credit.

What this place teaches me about myself: I could totes be a mannequin. Just pay me in noodles."}
{"text":"Came here for their lunch special.  

It is no doubt authentic no frills thai.

Food was good, however serving size was very small for me.  I definitely was not full.  rather stingey on the meat.  flavors were very good.  Cant complain about that.  

also, watch your head when you go to the washroom."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Pad Thai. However, I think they changed the chef or the recipe because their pad thai tastes a bit different (less flavourful) than two years ago. Nonetheless, still a nice place to go to for Thai food.

The store looks a little sketchy from the outside and the decor inside is not the best, but the food makes it worthwhile.

One thing to take note of is the bathroom. The bathrooms are in the basement and are a little creepy. The stairs are steep and makes an eerie sound sound. It doesn't help that the basement is dark and they sometimes turn off the light."}
{"text":"Had a chance to finally meet up with a good friend of mine. And this meeting was wayyy overdue. So I asked him what he felt like and bam he said, good thai at reasonable prices. The thought of Thai Country Kitchen came to mind. Now I have never been to Thai Country Kitchen but I've heard nothing but good reviews about this place. Thai Country Kitchen is located along Spadina near the end of the north side of chinatown and kinda looks like a hole in the wall place. No special decor and tho we went to dinner pretty late, there wasn't huge traffic only a few tables. Which sometimes could be a red flag.

My friend and I started ordering and wanted to get a decent amount of food. We started with a calamari appetizer and it wasn't bad. It was freshly deep fried and it was deep fried just enough. However, it did feel like it came from a frozen package, but surprisingly it was okay. For this price, you can't complain.

We ordred pad thai, a panang curry with beef and a yellow curry with chicken all with coconut rice. We also ordered a shrimp pad thai and thought it was slightly above average where once again no complaints. The noodles were cooked well, the flavour was good and it was saucy enough where it wasn't too saucy nor was it dry. And I would probably say, it was the curries which were a surprise. They were delicious. Now, I like my curry a little sweet, some even say I like it a little too sweet but meh. The curry that we were served had good consistency and the texture was well balanced. It wasn't watery or too thick, it was perfect. I liked the flavour and for me, outta the two I did like the panang curry slightly better than the yellow curry. But seriously both were definitely good. I felt the coconut rice was a little lacking, but that was probably the only negative.

Overall, I have to say I liked Thai Country Kitchen. Is it a good looking restaurant, no. But the food and the prices were definitely good. You can tell its family owned and operated where they cared about the food and how their customers were treated. And yes, my water was always filled without asking. So I would definitely come back if I was in the region and they have lunch specials too. Thai Country Kitchen will grow on you if you give it a chance."}
{"text":"Thanks to the other Yelpers who typed first about this place, I went there this past week.  John F, you sold it to me by first mentioning that it was 25% cheaper than most Thai restaurants.  Then I think I read Craaackle S's review, the words \"spring roll\" popped out... and lo, that's what I ended up getting -- PAD THAI (I requested \"vegetarian\", with no eggs), SPRING ROLL, DESSERT lunch special for $6.99.  I didn't ask until the food was ready, if it was the (westerner's) version of Pad Thai (the one w/ ketchup), or an authentic version.  Luckily, she told me that they had only one version at this place... the authentic version. 

I used to live around the corner of this place, back when it was the same restaurant - but had a different name and owner.  Food choices seem to be exactly the same.  Food quality seems to still be there, and it's hard to beat their $4.99 lunch food combos...  I took pics, so you can see if any of the items will appeal to you.  Call ahead for pick up.

Just like with the last owners, the people working there this time were Thai speaking.  

I'm happy this place is still around and offering Thai food at good prices.

The quality and taste of the food was good, but it was never like \"oh my god\".  The spring rolls are good, do try them.
The pad Thai was good, if you need your fix, this place will do what it can to satisfy.

In the past, I've had their eggplant dish (with basil leaves), and mixed veg dish.  Both good.  

I've also had their tofu lunch specials before.  At $4.99, it's still competitively priced for a hot meal to eat in or for take out.

I'll be back.  Just b/c Thai restaurants in Kensington are few, the prices here are right, and the overall taste is good.  Service, btw, was always with a smile and kind tone."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this because of the great reviews but it was really, really bland. I ordered the veggie pad si ew with extra veggies, and while they charged me for the extra it looked like just a regular amount. And the delivery took a long time to arrive. Sadly the same dish tastes a lot better at Thai Express..."}
{"text":"I LOVE Thai cuisine!! Thai Country Kitchen is my favorite authentic Thai place. It's very cozy with fantastic, affordable food, and friendly service. 

Their Pad See Ew was absolutely amazing! Very fragrant of the soy sauce flavor and cooked perfectly with egg, chicken and broccoli leaves. This truly reminded me of Bangkok street food so it definitely brought me back. Next, their Yellow Chicken Curry was simply delicious! Very coconut creamy with just the right saltiness and spicy kick. You could literally drink it up as it's that good! 

For dessert, you MUST try their Thai iced milk tea and Coconut Mango Rice. You won't regret it especially if you like sweets.

Overall, if you love authentic and very affordable Thai food, Thai County Kitchen is a hidden gem that you MUST try!"}
{"text":"I was craving for some Thai food near Chinatown, so I decided to check this place out due to all the stellar reviews it had on Yelp. I'm a huge fan of hole-in-the-wall type joints that whip out good food for less than expected prices, but my expectations were sadly not met during my visit here.

I ordered the chicken pad thai, which is my usual choice when trying out a Thai restaurant for the first time. The dish looked good in appearance, but it tasted a bit off after the first few bites. Each component of the Pad Thai tasted like it was cooked separately and then thrown onto the same plate for some reason. The noodles tasted saucier than the chicken, which itself tasted like it was stir-fried in a different sauce altogether. The peanuts in the dish tasted very oily and offsetting too. Overall, it was not an enjoyable experience for my palate.

The prices are very affordable, however, but you may be getting what you pay for when you eat here. For the price of the Pad Thai, I feel like I could've gotten a better tasting meal at a generic chain like Thai Express..."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good actually. Tasted fresh. I had the Massaman Curry Chicken which is potatoes, peanuts and curry sauce. Which is a great combination. No complaints.

The Con's are carpeted floors which attract dusts and hard to clean. Place needs a renovation. Not too much lighting."}
