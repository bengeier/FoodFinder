{"text":"I like this place, the food and quality is good. The portions are huge. Only problem I hope they will fix is the white rice. They should make yellow seasoned rice like the other middles Eastern places because it taste so much better then Simple white rice. If they change that they'll be probably the best place in town for shawarmas.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I stopped here one Saturday in January.  I ordered the chicken shawarma and beef samosas.  The shawarma was good, as well as the beef samosas.  However the service could be more friendlier and warmer.  I will try again in the future to give a final rating, as for now, it is a 3/5."}
{"text":"Amazing food, super friendly staff.  Highly recommended.  Just off the main drag of 16th Ave. easy to find.  Hard to beat this Shawarma"}
{"text":"Wow, it's really good! And I'm spoiled when it comes to Donairs.   Had a beef and lamb wrap, very tasty, not dry but also not greasy, medium size is $8 and it's a generous portion.   They also have baklava, falafel, samosas, salads, stuffed wine leaves and more. They offer three different meats, a mixture of beef and lamb, chicken, and a lamb donair.   The people working here are super nice! The place is very clean and has enough room to seat a few people   Parking is available right outside as well as a bus stop."}
{"text":"I'm not a picky eater by any means and I look for quality for my dollar. I have been to Shawarma palace many times now and highly recommend it. Both platters and wraps are great. Staff is very friendly and I have watched them interact with individuals who have never eaten shawarma before and helped them navigate the different flavours to ensure their experience is great. The atmosphere is friendly, clean, and welcoming. The food is great and lots of food for your dollar- tons of delicious meat in both wraps and platters."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is wonderful and the staff are great.  We have made at least 6 purchases since this place opened before Christmas.  I am pleased they chose my neighbourhood to open this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"By far my favourite shawarma in Calgary. The meat is nicely spiced, the portion extremely generous, and the price, below their competitors.   I was impressed with their compliance with food safety practices. We were there during dinner time and they had a backlog of wraps to make. One of the workers put a couple of wraps-in-progress on a different counter. The supervisor immediately called him on it and made him throw them out as the other counter had not been sanitized.   They offer 3 different meats (beef, lamb & chicken), falafel, dolmades, samosas and some salads. There are 2 different sizes of wraps offered - just be advised that the large is probably more than some people can eat. I am opting for the smaller size for my next visit.   Mustafa threw in a couple of free baklava to our order (which were delicious!). The only improvement that I could possibly make would be to have tabbouleh offered instead of parsley for the wrap, but that is just nitpicking. I only wish they were closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! The platter is so big I can't finish it. Humus is yummy, garlic sauce could be a bit more garlicky for my taste buds but glad it's included. No tamouli salad unfortunately but could live without. Second time here and I'm not disappointed."}
{"text":"Woooooooooow!! That's really all there is too say!!   I ordered a chicken platter w no rice to go. The service was phenomenal and the food, omg! THE FOOD. They warm the protein to order, so it's not all gross and nasty. It's tasty and fresh. Huge slices of potatoes. Not little dried up things. Because I didn't have any rice they filled my plate w extra veggies and extra pickles. The portion size is extremely generous. There was more than enough for myself and roommate. With plenty left over. Do yourself a favour, check this place out. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"New to the area and had a great welcome from their team and yummy shawarma!!! We will definitely be going back for more."}
