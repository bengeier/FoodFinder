{"text":"Amazing Food, & Great Service. Went with a friend who had tried this place earlier, and recommended going there for dinner. We ordered Burgers and Canadian Nachos. Best gourmet burger I have had in a very long time and the Nachos platter was huge and Finger Lick'n Good. Atmosphere was very friendly, and we chatted with the owner afterwards. We need more places like this in Scarborough."}
{"text":"sorry sorry, cuz i hv nvr rviewed u guys on yelp...

 heloo ppl pls try their burgers.... its sooooooo....!!! 5*"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. Me and my friend waited to be ACKNOWLEDGED by the waitress and she didn't even look at us when we walked in but she seated the people that were there after us. Then she proceeded to ignore us for another half hour. The service is terrible."}
{"text":"The owner is so cheap for a ten dollar plate I expect more meat on the plate and he refuses to turn the lights on. I turned the lights on and he came back to turn them off. I had a peri peri chicken sandwich and  and wings, the sandwich had little filling and the wings were drenched in oil. Its over priced, the entrance is weird, and forget the washrooms smelling like sewage the hall way there smells like sewage, I could go on about the washroom situation but I wont. They really need to redecorate and their water jugs are disgusting barely holds anything and looks like its from dollarama."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! I love the food there.. management is great! The portions are really big and the prices are not bad too.  I have been there more than 5,6 times and all the times.. service has been supberb! Better service than Affies Grill i must say!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. New location is bigger than previous one. I also like open concept kitchen where you can see your food bring made and most importantly cleanliness."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with my wife. Ordered French toast with strawberry compote, steak and cheese omelette, tea and coffee. The service was friendly and fast. The omelette was very good however French Toast was horrible. The toasts were drowned with some goopy sour strawberry syrup. Even when we removed the topping, we could still not taste the toasts as they had soaked the horrible strawberry syrup. I ordered another omelette with chicken and vegetables. This was very good as well. Even though we left the French toasts uneaten, were still charged. I guess the management was greedy and did not consider it unfair to charge for a returned order. We left there with a bad taste in our mouth. Not keen on going back there again anytime soon"}
{"text":"We ordered steak omelet , meat lovers omelet and pancakes with blueberry compote and coffee.was not happy with flavour and texture of omelettes.also meat lovers omelet does  have almost no meat in it. Taste of pancakes  and blueberry compote was horrible.service was good, fast and efficient.good thing about this place is \"halal\" but you have to compromise with taste.very disappointed."}
{"text":"The service is biased... which is too bad because the food is rather good. 
There are clear favourites and a preferred customer type.
I had the burger with a poutine as my side and my partner had a chicken dinner. The actual food is pretty decent good flavour, good Heat and good portion. 
 I hope that the chef and owner read this because the server's could do more for hospitality and overall cleanliness.

If I was to rate the food I would give it a three and a half out of 5"}
{"text":"I found this place to be a great spot for Halal Canadian / American cuisine with scarcely found options like Ribs (unfortunately they don't serve them anymore!) - besides this everything else on the menu is Ok (nothing that would get me to visit them from another city)
If you do happen to go there try the Jalapeno burger :)
Overall staff is friendly, abundant seating and free parking :)"}
{"text":"beyond upset this place is no longer open :( my husband and I loved this place. The owner was beyond amazing and nice. He is so welcoming and his food is delicious."}
{"text":"This place was the BOMB. Its unfortunate that it is now closed however hopefully another place like it will open up. Its hard to find good places like this that also serves Halal meat."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. It's a little gem hidden away. The food is 5 star quality at a very cheap price. The chef is really nice and is an expert cook with breakfast lunch and dinner. My mouth waters at everything that's cooked!"}
{"text":"Good Seating, Reasonable Prices, Friendliest Chef & Awesome Food!

Lots to choose from :)
I personally love their Chipotle Chicken and their Steak dishes."}
{"text":"Went to this place after a while today. They've changed their menu and concept (breakfast and lunch, open till 5pm) but the service and food is just as great as I remembered. I had the omelette from the breakfast menu - and I have to say this was the best omelette I ever had. Plus the staff is super friendly, the chef and the waitress are very kind. And honestly, the chef knows what he's doing, he cooks very well and is passionate. My only suggestion is to offer some sort of vegetarian options on the lunch menu. I don't eat meat but I'd like to try the lunch some time :). Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"An excellent *HALAL* food offering where everything tastes different with substantial quantity -- thats what Sizzling Skillet stands out for. 

I've been there several times with my family and friends on weekends or weekdays - the environment is always pleasant and consistent. Fast food delivery, caring customer service, great environment in the kitchen area (which is right infront of you), great atmosphere (with no food or greasy smell, door in or out), wide selection of food items (including breakfast, I've yet to try it though) -- and the biggest icing on top: affordable.

Their food tastes great - I've had several kinds of their chicken/beef items, and all have a unique flavour. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is OK. It's good for halal foodies, but the customer service just sucks. It takes forever to get seated, then for the server to come get your order, and what feels like hours for your food to arrive. They should think about hiring more staff. The interiors are decorated like a diner, but I heard some people were having their wedding festivities here. The food is average, basic diner menu. The burgers everyone raves about is blah, Top Gun or Hero burgers are better and yes they are halal too. Washrooms were dirty, and I don't think I would come back here per say unless I was in the area. It's not bad it's not great, it's just OK."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast after our religious holiday prayer on Eid. It was not so busy at the time we arrived, but was told by the host the tables are mainly all reserved. We were still able to get a table for the 5 of us.
I ordered the Nutella pancakes, sizzling omelette, mushroom and cheese omelette, sausages, and coffee. 
Now, we had our coffee within minutes of when we placed the order. Then the restaurant was getting more and more busy. After sometime, my daughter had her Nutella pan cakes. Then after 10 minutes of getting the pancakes we got the sausages. So we were having the meals staggered and not all together. After finishing the sausages, we waited and waited. It was well over 20 minutes from the time we had the sausages and 30-40 minutes from the time we placed the order that we did not have the omelettes. I finally went up and asked the server about the omelettes (thinking maybe she forgot) she said that it is very busy now so thy should be coming. Then she looked over in the kitchen said oh there ready, She'll bring them out. 
Now, the food was great!! Loved everything about the food, we were all satisfied with the portions and amazing taste of it. But the restaurant really needs to improve their hospitality management and have better time management."}
{"text":"I loved my order! I chose the chipotle steak panini and it came with fries and a can of pop for $10.48... A bit pricey but it was very good. After reading the reviews and ratings... It's amazing that there's already attention drawn on this place being quite new. definitely a place to try for great foods and a wide menu selection made fresh to order!"}
{"text":"Their burgers and paninis are amazing. Thats all i go there for and get great service from a friendly staff. Chipotle panini with Sweet potato fries +++"}
{"text":"Everything you've heard is 100% true and then some. We really enjoy coming to sizzling skillet for dinner with our family. Not only is it a \"family friendly\" atmosphere, the owner is extremely welcoming and of course the food is delicious. 

Typically we get the jalapeño peppers, burgers, and steak poutine - all 3 of which are delicious. The burger even comes with fries on the inside! 

My only reservation is that they are closed on Sunday's which is often a day where people love brunch - and since this place serves halal sausage and bacon, it would have been a big hit.. hopefully soon they'll be able to open their schedule so people can brunch away!

Lots of love for sizzling!

Edit: They are now open on sundays!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times with my siblings/friends and the food is usually good but there are a few things I feel can be improved upon. I mainly find the decor/lighting to be a bit unwelcoming as the atmosphere feels a bit too dark and damp. 

Atmosphere aside the food and service  is great! Last night I ordered a jalapeno cheese burger and the cheese nachos. Normally I order the peri-peri chicken sandwich and love it, but this time I wanted to try something different. The burger was great although I found that my tastebuds were too overwhelmed by the peppers and it was hard to taste anything else. 

This place is wonderful although next time I would not order the jalapeno cheese burger as my taste buds could not handle it haha."}
{"text":"Mediterranean Omlette was great for the vegetarians.
The chef came and spoke to us which was personable and inviting. The waitress was knowledgable about all the menu items. 

Poutine - Had my friend's poutine without the optional chicken or steak. It was delicious! Lots of flavour and spice. It was so filling.

The parking is around the building and it was cold inside."}
{"text":"Fairly new but these guys are awesome. Love their chipotle sandwich combo!! There steaks are also very good. Staff is great and the chef is SUPER friendly! Not very pricey either, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"been here twice, it was a great experience.  Hubby had ribs, and he fell in love with them.  I have had steak, I like mine well done and it takes them couple of times to get it right.  my kids also eat the burger well done, I don't like to see any red meat, and that also took couple of tries to get it right.  but none the less they did it.  Prices are ok for a party of 4 adults and 6 kids it cost around $200, I know thats alot, but for ribs and steaks, I was expecting it to be around that.  I don't like the side order of rice, the plating for the price they are charging is not up to par.  but only because we have a good time when I go there I am giving it 4 star."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service...this was the third time I have visited this place and they have been consistent."}
{"text":"Best Peri Peri Chicken Sandwich in town! Great service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times because it's in the plaza right across from my work.

It's a really cute diner with really friendly staff, and I think they're one big family.

The owner/chef is really nice, and always sparks up a conversation while we wait for out take out.

They have great specials for lunch : 7.95 and you have a selection of wraps,paninis and burgers.

From what I can remember:

1. The Jalapeno Cheese Burger : No real kick other than the standard jalap's they put on the burger. A few times it's been a little raw in the centre. But you can tell the pattie's fresh.

2. The Peri-Peri Chicken Sandwich - Great Flavour, but I think I got sick from it.

3. The Steak and Cheese Panini - Great Idea, but the steak is overcooked and shredded, and always leaves me picking it out of my teeth for hours after. Also, they put lettuce in the panini before they grill it, which is really ...odd.

On the plus side though, I really like the fries. 


I've had most of their lunch menu, and though it's fresh, I'd have to say I've experienced better.

And as a side note: Every time I've visited, I've noticed the portions getting smaller and smaller..(especially the delicious fries!)

They have great ideas on the menu, but it's just not executed properly. 

2 stars."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. The jalapeño burger was fantastic and their spicy poutine was out of this world! They're very very busy so making a reservation is the best way to cut on wait times. Great service and friendly staff. Only problem is the food doesn't arrive quickly! Totally worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here. Service was very good. The omelette and panini were amazing. Big plus it's halal.would definitely come here for lunch and dinner too. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Everyone should try this place out the food is so good can't wait to come back and stuff my face lol"}
{"text":"This resto is located at Markham and Finch.
It's a well put together family eatery. The owner is also the chef. He is very friendly, I've seen him bring food to tables himself, and talk to his guests. 

I've been here a few times and it is consistently good. It's not greasy. You leave feeling happy and full. I've eaten everything from the breakfast menu to paninis and everything tastes great. Price is reasonable and they also have lunch specials that are bang on.

Everyone should give this place a try. I'm sure you'll get hooked as I have."}
{"text":"Service 3* Food 2* Ambiance 2*
Decent. 2nd visit. Personally I got sick the next day. 
heard breakfast is good. May try that in the future but nothing else. Sampled chicken fajita wrap, steak panini, poutine with steak and peri chicken sandwich. None stood out. 
Too busy, to unorganized, turning business away. 
There were a few 'reserved' tables and weren't used in the hour we were there and they turned people away. Halal restaurants don't know how to run a business. 
Server was really nice and helpful. 
It's a halal option but that's it. 
Trying to do too many things at once and not good at anyone thing."}
{"text":"We came to sizzling skillet for a family gathering. It is American-Chinese-Pakistani fusion. They reserved few tables for us which were to the side of the restaurant and gave us enough privacy. Service was efficient and good. 

We ordered bunch of stuff to share. Beef poutine and chicken peri peri were really good. You have the option to get rice, fries or salad with the entree. I got my chicken peri peri with half rice and half fries. I recommend getting fried rice and skipping on the fries. I thought philly cheese steak was decent but some people in our group thought that it had a weird sweet taste. Bread wasnt super fresh and it had shredded beef. Best dish by far was the beef stir fry however, the portion on this dish was much smaller compared to others. Beef strips were tender and flavorful. I wish they used this beef in philly cheese too and didn't skimp on the portion of beef stir fry. Overall this is a good place and I'd recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, halal bacon and sausage. So good. 

Loved our experience at Sizzling Skillet. We dropped in for suhoor in Ramadan - I had heard that they were open till 3:30 AM every Friday and Saturday night, but I did not know how busy it gets, so did not make a reservation. Luckily, there were just two of us and we got there before the massive rush started (after 2 AM), so we were able to get a table after a short wait. 

The food was excellent and really hit the spot for suhoor. 
The portions were great for the price. We paid ~$25 for two of us to have big omelettes, along with rye bread, home fries, macon, sausage, and coffee. 

A very competent kid (I think his name was Yunus?) served us in a highly friendly and efficient way  - we got everything we needed in a timely way, and he checked on us a number of times but did not make us feel rushed. 

Overall, a great experience and we would go back with family/friends; only thing is I would make a reservation first. 

Bonus: there is a masjid next door for all your praying needs."}
{"text":"This place serves halal panini/wraps n fries, Which my wife likes
Other than that theres nothing much to it. The charbroiled burger disintegrated, stir fry portion too small so called \"savoury\" rice are plain basmati 
We used to be fans of this joint but dont know what went wrong with them

Service was slow given there was just 1 waitress second and third meal came 10 mins after the first was served"}
{"text":"This place has made huge improvements in the past couple of months. I visited for the first time last summer with a group of around 8 people. They didn't have air conditioning at the time, and so we were seated on the patio outside - we didn't mind though. However 6 out of the 8 entrees were mediocre, which is why I thought I would not be returning.

HOWEVER, I somehow landed back here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. The burgers (we tried 3 different ones - I can't remember which ones) were nice and juicy. The sauces for each burger were delicious. We also orders some Canadian nachos, which were good enough to completely change my opinion on this place. 

The service was great too. I will definitely be returning. Props to the owners/management on getting their act together! This is now a great option for those of us who like to eat out."}
{"text":"I had the garlic aioli chicken and waffle fries.

 Garlic aioli did not taste like garlic aioli at all.

 The chicken was orangish-red. It tasted more like a tomato-based dish, and not garlicky at all. And for some reason when I asked for the garlic aioli on the side, it was also orange.   Garlic aioli is supposed to be a white color with a yellowish tone, made of mayonnaise and garlic.

I didn't enjoy it and even if it was a different color and flavor, it still didn't taste good.

The waffle fries were good... but I guess I could thank the manufacturer for that.

I'm sorry but I won't return."}
{"text":"Sizzling Skillet is quite good! They are tucked away in the plaza on Ellesmere, so drive slow as you are approaching it! 

The restaurant is clean, contemporary and quite large. I opted for takeout this time, but it would be nice to dine here if it wasn't so far for me. Nonetheless, I'm glad I ventured here as I enjoyed Sizzling Skillet at their old (now closed) location on Markham Rd. 

My family got a few things here - chipotle chicken panini, peri peri chicken panini, peri peri chicken entree and jalapeño burger...everything was awesome! I personally had half of the chipotle and half of the peri peri panini and it was great!! 

The food was quite spicy so beware, but they can make it less spicy at your request. The spicy mayo and crispy panini pressed bread with the juicy chicken...mmmm...so delicious! The dishes also come with fries or a salad - the fries are so crisp and delicious. 

The price point here is quite reasonable too - 4 dishes for $46 with taxes in. 

In all, this is a solid spot for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Jalapeno cheeseburger with poutine fries is the way to go! Definitely fulfills that craving for a spicy kick. For first timers, the food surpasses their service as they don't greet you as you enter or guide you to your table (you pick the table) and payment is done at the desk."}
{"text":"I  went there yesterday with my friends around 8ish, and the restaurant had an open sign and it said on google that it is open until 10, we go there and it's closed.. Bad first impression"}
{"text":"Ventured here the other day for breakfast and this is now my go-to for brunch!  Everything was spot-on and there's no way I can't give them 5 stars.
They have seating arrangements for all:  solo, couples, groups and even families. Service was impeccable for a Sunday morning.  Servers were polite and very attentive.  I was starving when we arrived and they brought everything so quickly. I ordered the Toblerone pancakes ($7) with a side of spicy sausage ($3).  The pancakes were fluffy, delicious, and TOBLERONE.  The spicy sausage was not spicy at all and tasted amazing!  I've only had halal turkey sausage in my lifetime and I must say this is so much better.

My friend ordered the eggs with beef macon ($7).  We then ordered another one of these because we were just that hungry.  It was really good value because it included eggs, rye toast, home fries, and the beef macon.  The thing that got me was that I loved every single item in that combo and that never usually happens.
Lastly, this is a Halal establishment so keep them in mind when getting food with your Muslim brothas and sisters.  I had more options because I wasn't trying to avoid pork which pervades all the other breakfast joints I've been to in the past."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times. It did take them some time to prepare the meal which is why the three stars. When food is prepared it's good but it's nothing different. Home cooked meal can taste similar."}
