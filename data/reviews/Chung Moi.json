{"text":"Came on a recommendation from a friend. We had the chilli chicken dry, the chilli shrimp dry, the Manchurian mix fried rice and the chicken pakoras.   My favourite dish was the Manchurian Mixed Fried Rice - it was just the right level of spice - it's definitely got some kick to it so if you aren't a big spicy food eater you might want to ask them to tone it down. Portion size was huge! We had enough for lunch and dinner the next day.   Underwhelming was the chicken pakoras - they were not that great compared to others we have had from at other Hakka places. They were also quite pricy for what you were getting. They also came last which was a bit odd since usually they come as appetizers. We were halfway through our meal when they arrived and only had one each since our plates were full.   I know people rave about the prices at this place but it was only reasonable - not a super great deal. Our go to Hakka place is about 20 dollars cheaper and it's good food too!   I would still come again though"}
{"text":"after all the reviews here you dont need me to say how good this place is. been coming here since 2007 and although i skip out for periods of time, i always end up coming back here. everything i have here i loved, especially the chilli chicken with any combo of fried rice. if you are looking for THE best bang for your buck hakka, this is the place. both the gentleman and lady who runs this place are friendly and awesome to talk to. HIGHLY RECOMENDED!"}
{"text":"This place has really delicious Hakka food. Their chili chicken with gravy and fried rice is absolutely amazing. It was really hot so I burnt my tongue but delicious nonetheless.   I don't like close to Chung Moi but when I am in the neighborhood I am sure to stop by for some chili chicken."}
{"text":"The rating I have pointed out is primarily for the food.  Not for a dining out experience.   Most people who eat from there seem to do take-out.  All the better since after you eat there, you will be super full so it is probably better to be at home.    The inside and decor does have that older look... kind of like going back into the 70's or 80's, which I think actually adds to the charm, but it does feel clean. Also, not a place you will likely take on a date if trying to impress.     The service, don't expect Jack Astor's type \"Is everything ok?\" It's a Chinese restaurant.  Since it is a bit slower traffic, it doesn't have that hectic feel.    But for the food, I give it top notch standing.  I usually get the wet chili chicken. I've tried one of their fish dishes and its good too.  Usually, I have rice (or other substitute) at home.    There's alot on the menu, so I haven't tried many, but the few I've tried, I can conclude it is a place that knows about their food.  I've also scanned menu pics (sorry, it was in my pocket so it is a bit scrunched).   Parking lot at the front is pretty small, it might be easier to park to the plaza just to the west of it."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall but amazing food.  The spices are perfect.  Dry Chilli Chicken (without gravy) is where it's at.  My girlfriend and I usually complement that with their hot and sour soup (awesome) and Singapore style fried noodles.  There is so much food that not once did we finish it all ... score! as we can make another meal out of it.  We have also tried the Masala fried rice and Garlic shrimp and you can't go wrong with those either.    Pricing is very fair and if you happen to get in on their lunch special, they are equally as high on value.  Service is not the friendliest and the owner is a little brusque perhaps, but still it is always popular with consistent patronage so you know they come for the quality of the food.    A gem of a restaurant and one we'll keep coming back to."}
{"text":"Good food, decent service but amazing prices. Overall, still highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years. The food is great and spicy. The Hakka Chinese Pakistani food really hits the spot. Many folks opt for takeout and this seems to account for a great part of the business. They really shouldmgive a discount if you bringnyour own containers for takeout. I highly recommend Chung Moi."}
{"text":"chung moi? Not for this young boy.   THIS USED TO BE THE SPOT. But it went downhill over the years. Now you get overly cooked chewy chicken with little to no spice. I think people still come here because  1) they don't know where else to get hakka food 2) they don\"t know where else to get haka food  COME ON PEEPS! wake up and please stop wasting your $$$$  Check out Kimling or China cottage or ANYWHERE but here.   The worst is that recently a work collegue went here for lunch ( despite my warnings ) and found a cockroach in the food.   Nuff said!"}
{"text":"A bit dark and small for dine in but don't let that bother you.  Their food is amazing and give out huge portions, I mean huge portions for the money. Go there, you will not regret anything you buy from them."}
{"text":"You don't know Hakka till you've tried Chung moi Everything here is really tasty but I have to say their sweet and sour soup is probably the best I've had in the city. Family run restaurant with Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"the chili chicken is one of the best in town.   love it and I always have it once a week!"}
{"text":"We have been to Chung Moi a few times and I have to agree, the food is pretty good and the portions are really big. But the restaurant is in a sketchy area and the interiors are beyond deplorable, dark and dingy. The lady (owner methinks) is always in a bad mood and have heard her scream expletives at people on the phone - bad enough that we had to walk out with the kids. What pushed us over the edge was last time we took some friends over for dinner and before we could pay our bill the wait staff started emptying our leftovers and trash onto the table (the table is covered in plastic). That was uber revolting and we had to run out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've always loved Chung Moi. This is real Indian Chinese food of the best kind. (ok, ok, Karachi Chinese). Theresa, the tough, practical, and friendly restauranteuse has opted not to serve pork (I oink sadly about this omission) undoubtedly in deference to the Muslims among her clientele. Strangely though, booze is available. With many Bombay Muslims as my friends I sort of understand that. If I had the guts to question her about it all, I would ask. But I don't. I do have the guts to order anything on the menu. Hakka chow mein is brill - lightly soy-sauced stir fried noodles with your choice of shrimp, chicken, egg or all of the above. Dry chilli beef, chicken manchurian, shrimp schezwan, any of the special fried rice dishes, the soups - all outstanding. Be warned this is not Chinese food like you'd get at a Cantonese restaurant or Canadian Chinese restaurant (kill me please, before I review that). It's Indian chinese - garlicky, peppery, fiery with chilli heat. Chung Moi is practical and unfussy - cafeteria style tableware, the cliched Chinese rubbish on the walls,, plastic tablecloths and chopsticks, but who cares. It goes beautifully with a Heineken. Or three. It is greasy food, they do use MSG. And when you eat it, you suddenly understand the brilliance of the \"Don't ask, Don't tell\" policy. This is not a date restaurant. You'll find more romance at the gas station two doors east. But for foodies, looking for an Indian Chinese fix, Chung Moi is your friendly Scarberian pusher."}
{"text":"The chili chicken dry Manchurian fried rice is amazing. Just be ready to face the burning aftermath the next morning.  10/10 would suffer again."}
{"text":"Looking for some comfort food on a cold winter night and ended up at Chung Moi. Heard many good things about this place for some time now and decided it was time to give it a try.   Ordered my usual hakka dishes-chilli chicken (dry) and Manchurian chicken and shrimp fried rice. Both were full of taste and in my opinion had a little caribbean twist. The price was decent for the amount of food that was given.   All in all I would definitely recommend this place to a friend. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I give 10/10   We have been their loyal customers for more than 14 years. It cost us about 90 km back and forth trip, but it all worth it. Their main highlights are Dry Chilli Chiken, Chilli Fish, Hot and Sour Soup, Vegetable Chow Mein, Schezuwan Fried Rice, Vegetable Fried Rice, Shrimp Pakora   and the list goes on and on. I can't complain about anything. The food is just soooooooooooo yummy. You actually get confused what to order and what not. The owner husband and wife both are very humble .  word of caution: Ask for low sodium/ be like I want less salt  in everything.   I have been their customer for 14 years and I am telling you this for a reason.  Good luck you would not regret going there and spending your buck."}
{"text":"One of the best Hakka Chinese food in Toronto.  Not a great place for dine in though.  5 star for food 3 star for dine in experience."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout.  Really good Hakka food and not dripping of oil.  Portions are huge.  The restaurant looks cute inside."}
{"text":"Food is awful. Unauthentic and too much salt. The food I ordered was inedible from the amount of salt and msg that was in it. When I brought this to the very rude waitress that it is inedible and I wasnt paying for it because I barely ate it. She blamed it on me for not telling her right away. I'm sorry but no, I am not at fault for your food being disgusting. Not even an effort to try and compromise with me or compensate. The owner who sits at the cash is very rude. All the staff are difficult. Never returning and I hope this place shuts down. Made me so mad."}
{"text":"Saw their Instagram post and the food looked amazing. I was very disappointed. The service was ok. There was a large party their and some of the children running around and screaming, nothing was done about that. The Chef likes his corn starch because the sauces for our dishes almost had the consistency of glue. The prawn toast was burned, tasteless and very greasy. Their beef with ginger was the best because it did not have a sauce. It was a very disappointing dining experience and we will not go back!!!"}
{"text":"Was really craving for Wonton Noodle soup closer to Midland & St. Clair and found this restaurant on Yelp.  Read mostly good reviews about other foods however none about Wonton Noodle soup so decided to have a try. Restaurant was clean, & staff are friendly.  The Wonton noodles though are not the thin type that I am used to but it is okay. The broth was good and so were the pork wontons.  Would return again to try the other popular items on the menu."}
{"text":"Service is slow, because one server is handling the whole place. She does a good job, but the sheer amount of takeout seems hard to keep up with. The food is great. The hot and sour soup and chili chicken, in particular. The chicken is somewhat juicy but not grisly at all."}
{"text":"This place may be small and not look the greatest from the outside, but if you give it a chance it has some great food. Be careful when ordering because there is a bit of a language barrier and we ended up not getting all of the right drinks. The food is good and you get huge portions. There were 6 of us when I went and there was enough food for 10. It's a great place to go with a big group because you can all share the plates. Some stuff if pretty spicy so take their warnings if you can't handle that stuff. I really liked how there were options of Chinese and Indian and other foods. Everyone can find something they will eat even if you aren't so daring. The Pakoras are amazing and pretty spicy."}
{"text":"The chill chicken on egg fried rice is what keeps bringing me back here for the last 15 years ! Dine in and take out, the quality and taste of the food does not disappoint.   Check out their lunch menu for $7.50/dish daily from 11-3."}
{"text":"Best Sino-Indian food in the GTA. Their Chilly Chicken with gravy tops. They make an excellent Sweet Corn Chicken Soup and Chicken Manchurian as well. Great value for money as the portions are huge especially for dinner. They accept Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"Excellent Soup probably the best in town! Try the hot and sour soup, garlic shrimp and chicken pakora"}
{"text":"Desperate need for a Friday lunch so decided to get take-out for a couple of co-workers at this Hakka Chinese place.  The lunch specials were going for one meat plus rice for $6.99 each.  Had this in the past and I get the same thing every time.  The place is one of the favourites at our office.  Gave the restaurant a ring and placed the order at around 11:50 AM.  Everything was straightforward.  She told me that it would be ready in 20 minutes.  Went to go pick it up and my order was there sitting ready to go.  Yes!  It was tightly packaged and really hot.  Nice and neat.  Excited, I asked for one set of chopsticks as I only like to eat Asian food with 'em.  Cashed out and was on my way back to work.  After distributing to my very happy co-workers, I opened my styrofoam container... mmm... Manchurian Chicken (Dry) on Rice!  The food was good.  It never really had blown me away or was so delicous but it was good enough to feed the hunger.  It had a tiny bit of spice and okay flavour but it really was just fried chicken pieces on crappy rice.  Ate more than half and was satisfied.  I have had this dish with sauce in the past and it was a spicy, soupy nightmare. The food is not even close to my favourite Hakka restaurants but like I said, did the job, no fuss, no bust."}
{"text":"Ok, so after hearing and reading so much about this place, I knew I had to try it for myself. I wanted to first try their lunch special first before going all in and order a whole multi-item meal for dinner.   I got the Chilli Chicken with plain rice, and I have to say it was honestly really delicious. The sauce was packed with a pepper flavour that I've never had before and the chicken was so great, it felt like I was  eating white meat the whole time. I didn't get a single piece of cartilage.  The quantity was huuuugeee, I know I could definitely eat 2 more servings and still not finish. Lastly, I loved that fact that the chillies in the sauce were fresh! Like you could actually see the vibrant green colour in the dish and it made a world of a difference! I feel like most other restaurants put the vinegar chillies in their chilli chicken dishes, so this was a pleasant surprise!   They were also nice enough to give us chillies in vinegar and red chilli sauce for free with the meal when we asked. Lately a lot of restaurants have been pretty strict and refuse to give those out with lunch specials, reserving them only for dinner take out.    Overall, the pricing for this place is a bit high, but after tasting the food, I can see the quality of the ingredients they use are quite good."}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese food restaurants I've been to. You must get the Hot and Sour Soup as an appetizer! I usually don't like soups but this one is exceptional. Chicken fried rice and the chili chicken are really good as well. The servings are generous and we always end up taking food home."}
{"text":"Chung Moi is my go to place for a great Hakka lunch! I've been a few times now and I can't pull myself away from the Chili Chicken!  One tip if you can't handle spicy I would highly suggest you tell them make it mild which will still be hot, just not flaming! Each dish is make from scratch so the quality is top notch!  It can get busy at lunch time so be sure to get there early. I've tried the vegetable pakora and it's great as well. If you want great Hakka go see Teresa and her team and she will definitely not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I'm not too familiar with authentic Hakka good, but this place is delicious! Hot and sour soup is not the typical one I usually have at Chinese restaurants, and a flavour I cannot describe - other than fresh. Chili chicken was flavourful and spicy as is there masala fried rice. Generous portions, and good prices, will definitely bring me back."}
{"text":"My family has been ordering from here for ages. Every time my birthday comes around Chung Moi is on our table. I especially love the American Chop Suey, reminds me of ABC Restaurant in Karachi.  It's best for take out as the dining room is a little dingy and dark, though clean. I think my family has known the owner forever, so this place always has a spot in our heart. The portions are huge, the price is right and what more do you want?"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place, so decided to give it a try. Like many others who have reviewed the place, it's not much to look at from the outside but once you walk in, it's a whole different story. It looks like it's been recently revamped and most of the diners there seemed like regular patrons. Service was good and the food was outstanding. I was only disappointed with the masala fried rice that I ordered based on the reviews here of that dish. I think Bao Shin in mississauga tops the list for the best masala fried rice in the GTA. Was very impressed with the dry chilli chicken and the yung chow fried rice. A must try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Finally went here after years of friends telling me to do so.  First off, it's in the ghetto. Right across from Kennedy Station.  The parking lot sucks. The interior is your typical Indian Hakka 1992 motif.  But the food is good. The prices are decent. The portions are huge.  I can see why it's a fave of so many people, and why it is underrated...  Worth checking out if you're in the area.  Destination worthy - hmm, probably not."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for lunch for many years and realized that i've not written anything about this place. First of all, I stumbled upon this place after seeking a Hakka place not far from the office. I've had pretty much everything on the menu over the years. I've also brought many of my colleagues here for lunch and they also returned.   Inside, there are tables inside to accommodate from 2 to 10 people, the place is clean and always well maintained. I like the casual atmosphere and pay later attitude. The register is located by the front counter making it easy to pay on the way out or put in a takeout order without having to go through the entire restaurant.  It's pretty clear I enjoy the food here, what specifically enjoy about CM is the quality of the food and large portion sizes. Spice levels are also good, I'd say 7-8/10 for their spicy dishes. Sauces and gravies are not as pronounced as some of the other places making the plates more centric on the ingredients and lighter looking than usual."}
{"text":"A friend introduced us to this restaurant and now we are hooked. My favorite is the masala fried rice and shrimp. I've tried other things on the menu but the rice and shrimps are the best so I stick to that! Lots of spice and flavor."}
{"text":"Just like Good luck Chinese restaurant which is a few mins away but better by taste and even bigger portions. They have renovated the restaurant which makes it  decent to bring friends, family and the person your dating. Okay maybe  it is better to take her on the 10th date.  The deep fried shrimp were bigger and tasted better than the ones at Good luck. I would recommend the following dishes:  1. Mandarin Chicken 2. Masala Fried Rice 3. Goat Curry 4. Chili Chicken 5. Deep fried shrimp  There used to be this depressing and rude waitress who just ruins the whole experience, but  when I went on Saturday I was greeted by a much more friendlier and accommodating server. Therefore, I think this place deserves 5 stars"}
