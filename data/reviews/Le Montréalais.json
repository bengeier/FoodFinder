{"text":"I've always wanted to try afternoon tea and be fancy like my namesake, Princess Diana. I was really looking forward to the afternoon tea here, but unfortunately it fell short.  To start, there was no one at the hostess table and when a gentleman finally spotted us, he had no idea what he was doing.  The place was completely empty. The table we were seated at had a cute set up with miniature jars of jam. Except... one of them was previously opened and used. Ewww. The waitress did promptly bring us new jars, though. The tea tasted pretty good... we had the earl grey and buckingham palace. They had a pretty decent selection of teas as well.. about 15 or so....and we got our water refilled, so they lasted long. The three tiers of food served was a cute presentation but lackluster in taste.  I thought afternoon tea would be much more refined and memorable."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and service is great! Highly recommended! I had the squash set menu which came with squash soup, spaghetti squash appetizer, duck as entree and zucchini creme brûlée whereas hubby had the lamb chops. Everything was excellent and very yummy. Our waitress Veronique was super friendly and very accommodating - I had dietary restrictions like no ripened cheese and since they use oka cheese in most of the sauces she made sure the kitchen wasn't using any. She even took the time and explained most components on the plate to make sure it was safe for me to eat. Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"So far not so good.    The wait staff couldn't decide if they wanted to serve me.  Not sure why yet.    To busy I guess.     Bartender seems have gotten the nod.   Seems like a nice guy.     For lunch not to adventurous going to have a burger and a beer.       Only one night and one day in this terrific city"}
{"text":"Le Montréalais is connected to the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth Hotel where I stayed during my visit in Montréal. Since this place was right downstairs from my hotel room, I decided to give this restaurant a shot.   Upon entering this restaurant I was greeted by a friendly and cheerful hostess who seated me near the window overlooking a beautiful cathedral and the streets of Montréal. This place was very cozy, clean and classy. The restaurant included a pretty bar and private rooms to accommodate larger groups for parties.  The staff was very kind and provided great service. I had the option of ordering something from the menu or choosing their buffet option at the time. I asked for the menu. The menu consisted of grilled meats, sandwiches, seafood, French delicacies, Mediterranean dishes and tempting desserts and more.   The food was good and the portions were nice. Things are a bit pricey though, but not too pricey (I came here for lunch). The café au lait was really delicious! I had a great time at this restaurant.   Overall, Le Montréalais is a pretty restaurant with good food and great service. It's a little pricey, but I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. Worth trying once, probably among the upper middle pack of Sunday Hotel brunches I've tried. Service was welcoming and faultless. Bar seating for the single diner. Food-wise It's a much stronger offering for the sweet tooth rather than savory, and this is the main reason to indulge. Possibly the best crepes Suzette I've had in my life and every single item I sampled from the dessert pastry table is outstanding. (And I'm not a dessert guy so that tells you something.) Creme brûlée came in two types; passion fruit and classic vanilla. Both did not disappoint.   Cant say the same about the savory offerings and these diminish my rating. The roast beef carving was probably the best item but had a poor partner in its accompanying tarragon sauce. Ravioli and potato lyonnaise were classically prepared with heavy sauces - unfortunately they were more suffocating than luxurious. Most of the other hot items looked unappetizing; eggs Benny that were sitting out, a mixed grill that looked tired, lamb t-bones that were uninviting. Maybe these were good; I moved off the hot bar after my first plate disappointment but I'm pretty sure I was right not to try. Sweaty meats, pates, cold mussels, and smoked fish were good but these are supporting cast at best and hard to screw up.   All in all this is a satisfactory option if you're staying at the hotel and a special enough brunch to try at least once. On my next visit to Montreal I will probably skip it - better eating and value out there for the money."}
{"text":"Served us bread but no utensils, didn't know the daily menu, didn't know the daily soup. When the waiter came back with the daily soup, the only description was \"vegetable soup, with umm... Pieces of vegetables\".   The soup was overly salty and simple.   It took forever for the entree to arrive."}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast and lunch buffets! The service is also excellent, with good attention to drink refills and taking plates away.  I was happy to have such a good hotel restaurant available to use during our stay at the Queen Elizabeth."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday night with family, during the holiday season. There was few people, and the atmosphere was very quaint and quiet.  I ordered the clam chowder, seafood poutine, and prime rib with Bearnaise sauce and French fries. I also had the all-you-can-eat dessert bar for only 12$. The dishes all seemed very unique and creative. There was a vast selection of desserts. Everything was delicious and though it definitely wasn't cheap at all, it was still reasonably priced for a restaurant in a Fairmont hotel. Also, the portions are surprisingly larger than I'd expected from a fancy restaurant (which usually serve tiny, beautiful portions of food on enormous plates).  The only downsides were that the complimentary bread was served cold and the waiter took a long time to fill our glasses of water."}
{"text":"Peaceful place with a view right on the Cathedral. Helpful and smiling staff, tasty food and great alcohol-free colada. Although the prices are rather high, it's definitely worth going. The place is a relief after noisy, crowded and sometimes bad smelling station."}
{"text":"Best Sunday Brunch in Montreal and terrific value. Sebastian from James Bay was one super waiter and with the roving guitar serenade .... well you can just imagine. Entire hotel is closing in June '16 for a year to rehab the whole facilty so if your in andcaround Montreal this IS your Sunday Brunch spot."}
{"text":"Service is good, food just regular. The foie grass was mediocre, and the rest of the plates followed the same patern. It is convenient if you stay at the Fairmont, but I would not make the trip if you are looking for something really good."}
{"text":"Oh you poor yuppy that so foolishly extols the weekend brunch!  You don't even know what a proper brunch is!  Unless you've been to Le Montrealais of course!  Because it's nestled in the Fairmont hotel and looks expensive (and it kinda is), Le Montrealais seems to scare away a certain segment of potential clientele.  Which is unfortunate since foodies may really be missing out (I'm looking at you, Yelpers).  Any time I've been here, it seems to be primarily populated by people celebrating graduations, first communions, or marriages.  But I understand why.  They have an immaculate dining room with linen-cloth tables and waiters harken back to the days when wait staff was populated by professionals, not jaded quasi-adults.       The crepes are fresh made the crepe station with toppings added on demand.  The cold buffet is best .......The hot items are constantly being prepared right behind the area where their served....but here is where the buffet suffers.  When the food first comes out, it's easily 5 star quality.  But for every 14 minutes it sits out, it loses a star.  Do you really expect Eggs Florentine to sit out well, what with salmon and spinach congealing?  But the beef cutlets and stuffed porchetta are constantly replenished, so I've never had complaints about either one of them.  And the cheeses, fresh salad bar, and desserts.  They're so varied , I can't even mention it all.  So rather how would I describe the food?  Just imagine what an extensive albeit traditional entrees served at a high end restaurant should be, with a Canadian flair (maple syrup is heavily favored along with blueberries).    Perhaps I have an unfair perception of this place as I'm always a starry-eyed tourist when I come here, but damned if I can't feel like I'm in a moment when I listening to the Cathedral's bells while watching a light snow silently drop as I sip spiced cider with my grand marnier crepes from my table."}
{"text":"My friend came to Montreal so I thought of going to have some afternoon tea together. The set was $26 without sparking wine. They have a good set of teas to choose from. However, considering the service and the treats, they were not among the best afternoon teas I have had even in Montreal. Waitresses seemed to push us to finish. The jam was in a jar instead of kitchen prepared. The scones were kind of loose. The cream was not very spreadable. The macaron was not great enough. The cream in the puff was not great either...."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here, this restaurant is located inside of a hotel and the cuisine is very mediocre which made me feel as if they don't truly have to strive for food perfection in order to thrive because they have individuals staying here and eating here by default .   I travel for work all over the United States and internationally , this is a combination of one of the worst meals which happened to be a bit expensive .   I ordered the duck based off of reviews on Yelp and the waiters suggestions  . The vegetables that came with my duck were absurd seriously NO FLAVOR and mushy , they seemed microwaved and the Starchy purée my duck was sitting on was crackled and stiff as if it had been sitting out for a while . The sauce on the duck saved it a little .The duck itself was flavorless and even my waiter told the chef it was overly raw . The platter for almost $40 was an utter disappointment   The restaurant manager was upset and very rude that I did not want to order something else   My partner ordered the prime rib and our waiter mentioned it was unusually small, flavor wise it was very mediocre as well. Montreal has many places to eat that are fantastic , skip out on this place save yourself $100.00 and eat great elsewhere at a specialty place . I should note they took my duck off of the bill"}
{"text":"Firstly, the place drips of class. The interior is lovely, and sets a perfect mood for an outing in Montreal.  The waiters at Le Montrealais are amazing. They are kind, friendly, and extremely efficient.  I thought the food was also pretty good. It wasn't out of this world, but than again, I went there at brunch.  Overall, I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here for a Christmas Day brunch. After we sat down, the server came over and gave us orange juice. But nobody told us if we should stay at our table, or go hit the buffet--so we went to check out the buffet stations. Some dude dressed in chef clothing was looking very upset standing in front of the stations, I asked him if the food was ready, he pointed at the stations, said \"apparently they are not ready\", and went back to shaking his head. I guess he was more angry than me at the food being not ready.   We sat for another ten minutes, and finally saw the people started moving. We hit the stations--seafood, cured meats, eggs/hot food, and desserts. I have to say, I've had WAY better brunch buffet than this, both in Seattle and in Chicago. The cured meats don't look fresh, the hot foods have various level of warmness. The only good thing I saw was the dessert station and the breads. At least the French people know how to do the sweets right."}
{"text":"Thank goodness it is in the lobby of our hotel.  After a night of Christmas party dancing this place felt like just what I needed.  The service is tops and the atmosphere is very classy and elegant.  Our server immediately got our beverage orders and we were happily settled in our window side table.  Teas were good and were under the Fairmont brands.  How cool is that.  They do not do that anymore.  I had a the Eggs Benedict and my bestie had the omelette and we were both very happy with our meals.  I must say for my plate the potatoes and asparagus that accompanied it were cooked to perfection!  Usually the sides do not bowl me over but it totally did in this case.    Because I was so hungover I craved a bit more food but something sweet to end the meal.  They had a great selection of desserts in the buffet that you can dig in for $8.50.  Not bad considering how delicious looking they all were!  French pastry...how can you go wrong.  Finally I decided I wanted a simple pain au Chocolat which was not on the menu.  As I sadly gave back my menu to our server I lamented that what I wanted was not on the menu.  He nicely asked what I craved and he said he will see what I can do. Within minutes...et voila!  Chocolate croissant!!!! Perfect!!!   So yes I will go back here for the brunch buffet and the tea and the great service!  How addictive that it is all under our hotel! Prices are higher but so worth it."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé avec des copines, c'était bon mais nous avons été déçues des portions et moi de mon entrée, j'ai pris un tempura de fruits de mer, et c'était juste 4 fruits de mer frits.. pas très copieux, surtout pour le prix (14$ me semble) Beau décor, service ok mais sans plus, on devait toujours rappeler pour demander de l'eau.. Pas terrible"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great Sunday Brunch this is THE place to go in Montreal. I have been many times over the years and I am always impress.  The selection is amazing, as is the quality and service"}
{"text":"The brunch buffet here has tons of choices - everything you could want and more. The crêpes station is awesome and there are lots of other choices.  This hotel is going to undergo some major renovations soon, which are needed and welcomed, so I'm looking forward to the next incarnation"}
{"text":"J'ai été un peu hésitant lorsqu'on m'a dit qu'on allait bruncher au restaurant Le Montréalais de l'hôtel le Queen Elizabeth. Qui va dans un restaurant d'hôtel de nos jours? Mais bon, je me dis qu'avec un hôtel de qualité vient un restaurant de qualité. J'avais raison.  Donc, le dimanche au restaurant Le Montréalais, c'est des brunchs pour tout le monde.  L'ambiance est très prestigieux je dirais.   Ce qui m'a rendu heureux assez rapidement était le \"bar à crêpes\". Il y avait une chef qui faisait cuire ou flamber avec du grand Marnier les crêpes avec 3 sauces, des fruits et de la crème fouettée. En plus, il y avait des crèmes brûlées vanille et chocolat à côté.   Bien sûr, il y avait aussi un bar à fromages avec une dizaine de fromages et beaucoup de pains. Avec en bonus une assiette de mures et framboises.   C'est là que j'ai décidé de faire quelque chose qui changera ma vie pour les prochaines minutes : mettre de la crème brûlée sur une crêpe flambée. Sérieux, c'est telllllement bon.   Il y aussi un bar à dessert de qualité avec une vingtaine de gâteaux.  Et un chanteur sur les lieux qui jouait de la guitare pendant ce temps.  Si j'avais à dire un seul downside de cette histoire... ce serait le prix. À 40$ par personne, disons que ce n'est pas le genre de restaurant que tu vas souvent et pour toutes les occasions. Par contre, étant donné que je suis un bon mangeur, j'ai mangé pour au moins 40-50$ eh eh.  Sinon, j'irais plus là en gang qu'en couple, ça manque un peu de romantisme.  4/5 pour la bouffe  2/5 pour le romantisme"}
{"text":"The Fairmont was disappointing, but this busy and dynamic restaurant just off its lobby entrance is the real gem of the place. The breakfast here is IMPRESSIVE in quantity and quality: omelette bar, endless spread of pastries, wonderful selection of fruit, and faultless service. The waiter was so efficient and gracious, he made us feel simultaneously special and at home - this is what you hope for when you're starting out a sunny day in a foreign city. One of the lovely wonders of this breakfast bar: eggs Benedict you take and make yourself, complete with creamy Hollandaise and delicious Canadian ham. Carefully prepared, nicely presented. And self-serve! Easy to overeat. Highly recommend for a classy breakfast."}
{"text":"The food wasn't spectacular but not bad - pretty standard for what we ordered but definitely not worth the price.. Especially for lunch which is when we came... But we did the a la carte, which was probably a mistake and I would imagine that the buffet would have been more fun based on the other reviews.  However, the servers were very friendly and funny but they forgot a few things, like a glass of wine that was ordered before anything else lol but our server was so nice and bubbly that we couldn't really be irritated with him - plus he apologized and told us that the glass was on him. And both servers were joking around and happy to take photos of us, which was very much appreciated.   I think that this restaurant is a good quiet place to have a business meeting or some type of casual gathering but definitely not somewhere to go if your primary interest is tasty food.  Take home message: I didn't go here for the food, and I wouldn't go back for it, but with limited time to eat and catch up with visiting friends staying in the hotel, this restaurant served its purpose.  I might go back just to try their dessert bar one day though, because the photos look quite tasty."}
{"text":"Spent a few evenings at Le Montrealais during my stay at the Fairmont, and I must say that I very much enjoyed being here. From the friendly staff, the decor, to the food and wine, the experience was great. Although I was by myself, the staff made sure I was kept company and entertained, and at times invited to sample some of their delicious food. I recommend the white tuna carpaccio and salmon tartare, it was delicious! It is a beautiful restaurant/bar that you must try at least once if you are in Montreal."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée pour le célèbre brunch du dimanche avec ma famille. C'est sûrement un des meilleurs brunchs en ville.  Il y a de tout, mais ce que j'aime le plus sont les poissons fumés et les salades! Beau choix de desserts.  C'est chic, mais l'ambiance est aussi familiale; beaucoup de familles viennent y célébrer un anniversaire. Un joueur de guitare vous offrira une sérénade si le coeur vous en dit!  Il vaut mieux réserver votre table, car c'est toujours plein!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent for a hotel restaurant. Good French food, especially the seafood dishes, and fantastic pan-fried calf liver. Kindly waitstaff who don't take offense if you don't speak French, which is a breath of fresh air in this unforgiving city."}
{"text":"Wanted a simple Caesar salad for dinner and looked like a decent place based on the reviews. Not impressed. Service was slow from start to finish - took them 10 minutes to come over just to seat us. We asked for a table by the windows and she sat us about a table over and said as she walked away \"that's close enough.\" Would have been nicer to ask us if that was an ok spot, especially since it was very quiet on a Sunday night. Salad was okay, but dressing was way too fishy tasting for my liking. All in all a sub par experience."}
{"text":"While I'm not usually the biggest fan of eating in hotel restaurants, particularly in Montreal where there is an abundance of good spots all over the place I must make the exception for Le Montrealais.  I came for the afternoon tea and it was an excellent experience.  It costs about $26 but once in a while it is worth the splurge.  The waiter brings out a variety of teas at the beginning to allow you to sniff them and decide on which one you want.  They have a pretty good selection and it is hard to choose just one.  In the end I opted for something traditional like Earl Gray which hit the spot.  Foodwise they bring out a variety of traditional tea foods like finger sandwiches, scones and pastries.  The cucumber watercress sandwich was quite good and the scones were divine.  They were served still warm and had a fluffy interior but a crisp exterior.  Pastrywise the strawberry tart was pretty good.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the crust but the pastry cream and strawberries made up for it.  I also quite enjoyed the macarons."}
{"text":"Il y a de ces endroits où on se la joue \"classe\" et où classe est confondue avec snobisme et attitudes affectées. Du coup, le client se sent écrasé par la grande claaaaaaaassssse du serveur et n'a qu'une envie: déguerpir, plus capable de supporter ce \"bully\" formé à l'école d'hôtellerie.   Au Montréalais, il y a la classe, l'élégance, le raffinement et l'AUTHENTICITÉ. Pas de serveurs snobinards qui se la jouent. On vous accueille avec politesse et attention. Ici, j'aimerais rendre un hommage tout spécial à Sylvain qui m'a servie dernièrement. Drôle mais discret, serviable sans être envahissant... un professionnel!   J'y vais pour l'heure du thé. Les scones sont sûrement les meilleurs au monde. Oubliez ces boules de pâtes compactes qui vous font faire une overdose de poudre à pâte. Ceux-là sont fondant, juste ce qu'il faut de sucré, presque légèrement feuilletés... Et la crème Devon!... La marmelade d'orange maison... Les petits sandwichs au concombre... Sans compter les autres petites pâtisseries françaises toutes aussi délicieuses.  Oui, l'excellence existe."}
{"text":"A Royal Tea  I have always believed that I was some form of royalty--in another life.  Maybe I was Nefertari or Vashti but the delusions of grandeur which I suffer from today had to come from somewhere, right?!  Because of this I was not going to pass a chance to have tea at the Fairmont Le Reine Elizabeth in Montreal.  We arrived in style and managed to look totally dignified although it was a wet and nasty rainy day.    The Fairmont Queen Elizabeth hotel offers two different afternoon pastimes for a midday break:  Afternoon Tea and Kaffe Klatsch:   \"England has its Afternoon Tea, Austria Kaffe Klatsch\"  Le Cafe Klatsch An Austrian coffee break with your sweet and savory treats which include:    - Beef and pickles sandwich    - Liverwurst sausage sandwich    - Smoked Westphalie ham sandwich    - Macaroon    - Almond biscuits    - Sacher cake    - Apple Strudel    - Fruit tartlet  L' Afternoon Tea A traditional English afternoon tea with a wide range of tea selections and finger sandwiches, scones and sweets.  Finger Sandwiches We LOVED these and could not get enough.  Seriously, we had them bring an extra plate of sandwiches!     - Chicken and watercress    - Egg & cucumber    - Smoked salmon  All of the sandwiches were fantastic but the Chicken and watercress sandwich was our favorite.  The Scones The scones, the scones, the scones!  Just look at them and you know they are ridiculously good.  The Tea Selecting the tea was the best part of our experience.  The process begins with your server presenting the \"tea box\" at the table.  You then can spend as much time as you need to smell your way to a decision.   With over fifteen choices, it took us almost forty-five minutes to pick three teas:    - The Queen Elizabeth    - Vanilla Chai    - Mint Green  All three were phenomenal!  Trifecta of Treats What is a Par-Tea without the sweets?  I was happy that the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth didn't overdo it with the dessert.  They picked the perfect three!    - Chocolate eclair    - Strawberry tart (my absolute favorite)    - Macarons (various flavors)  My all time favorite was the Strawberry Tart.  I liked it so much that I stole bites from my friends!  I was so happy we had a welcomed \"distraction\" from the fabulous weather.  I really can not think of a better way to spend a rainy afternoon--or a sunny one for that matter.  All I know is that L' Afternoon Tea gets a pinkie up and is truly meant for a queen!  I will have to try the Le Cafe Klatsch next visit."}
{"text":"I ate here today, Saturday, at around 1:30pm. The service was good but a little slow. I was not impressed by the menu. The salad bar peaked my interest so I went with that but it turned out to be ok. Yes, just ok. Aside from the typical veggies, lettuce, and salad dressing there really wasn't much else. A few pre-made salads like beat salad, couscous, mushroom salad. Fruits that really kind of tasted funny. No cottage cheese! No pasta salad or Greek salad. Soup of the day was an extra $9.50 , in addition to the salad bar which was already $18.50. I have no desire to return here. Really did not feel like I got the money's worth."}
{"text":"Not my everyday type of restaurant but once in a while why not spoil ourselves. I had been here a few years back for their buffet and was hoping they still had it but it was not the case. Food was excellent but found the service was just a tad off!!! But still enjoyed the evening with staff. I had the filet mignon and it was small in portion but excellent in taste. I loved the dessert which I normally do not eat but it was home made Mille feuille. WOW!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for the afternoon tea and had a great experience!    Cons: *old décor and not very well-maintained, just like the rest of the hotel, but it was still elegant in an old-fashioned way *my tea service for one looked rather lonely in the tower! (It'd look fuller with food for 2-4 people) *clotted cream was refrigerated - didn't taste fresh *jam wasn't house-made  Pros: *food was delicious *great tea selection with a nice little infosheet to explain the choices *excellent service! *great price ($26 without champagne, $35 with) - the same thing would easily cost twice as much in Toronto hotels!  Had a great experience and was very happy all in all. :)"}
