{"text":"Sweet little spot for breakfast or lunch.Their espresso drinks are brewed to perfection and their menu had plenty of yummy options for both me and my vegetarian husband. I ordered a bagel with salmon and the salmon was thinly sliced but had just enough flavor along with the cream cheese. The staff is very friendly and the establishment clean and quiet enough to enjoy a peaceful brunch. They had limited outdoor seating but plenty of air-conditioned indoor seating."}
{"text":"Le brunch du dimanche est excellent!!  Nous etions 6 et tous ont beaucoup aimé.  Le service est courtois lambiance feutrée nous permet de se réveiller tout en douceur avec le sourir au lèvres."}
{"text":"One of the cutest cafes downtown! Amazing turkish brunch on sundays for a really good price!"}
{"text":"Clémentine keeps revamping its game. Its relatively new. Their coffee is so good the barista keeps remembering that i am the 'almond milk' latte girl! If you are looking for a Turkish Brunch spot this is the place - make your reservation on their website cause it gets packed!  Turkish Brunch is filled with pastries, delicious breads,homemade jams, cheese,  eggs with sucuk (known as the Turkish Sausage), if you haven't had it...its divine! Of course there is no Turkish Brunch without the famous Turkish tea!  Brunch is a great try for this place, but I also recommend it as a weekday lunch spot or just a stop over for a quick coffee to go with an almond croissant!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for brunch on Sunday. The food is really tasty and you can eat a lot (buffet style), is better to do a reservation because is quite full on Sunday. Tha only thing is that I found a little expensive for a buffet brunch"}
{"text":"I came here last year and the pastries were divine with flaky crusts and light tasty cream fillings. They have taken a turn for the worse! This visit I found the pastries doughy and the cream filling thick and relatively devoid of flavour. Sad. They must have lost their chef."}
