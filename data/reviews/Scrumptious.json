{"text":"Service is good. Price is similar to other breakfast places but portions are small. If it's egg sandwich then you can't taste egg much because they probably put one egg in whole sandwich. Coffee wasn't the greatest.  They don't have early bird special. Three eggs any style $5.79 with no meat at all. Never go back again."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast diner. Both the service and the food were very good. Pancakes were perfect and smothered in fresh sliced strawbs and bananas. The Egg white scramble was just as good. The place just has a very friendly, very authentic, atmosphere. We shall return!"}
{"text":"One of our book club members visited this place a lot so we decided to have the book club there.

I had an egg dish with smoked salmon. Now I haven't had a lot of smoked salmon, so I loved the flavour, but my enjoyment came from inexperience rather than any strength the restaurant has.

It is not that much better or worse than the dozen of breakfast places I've been to over the years who usually does a good job. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals as well.

{"text":"As I came into the restaurant, the waitress and the owner greeted me and my husband with a smile and a warm greeting, \"Good Morning\". It is really an early morning at 7-ish am since we are still suffering from our jet lag. I feel like sitting in a cafe inside a hotel. Perhaps the music  allows me to feel  relaxed. We are the only customers in the restaurant, probably we came too early on a Sunday morning. An interesting thing is I see the ? chef shaved a batman icon at the back of his head.

My husband and I ordered an Egg Benedict with Montreal Smoked Meat to share. The presentation looks awesome. When I cut the benedict, I could see melted cheese in between the smoked meat. The Montreal smoked meat is really outstanding from the benedict. The eggs are soft, when I cut the eggs, the egg yolks spills out and runs through the smoked meat. The fries, one of the sides, tastes crispy. It also comes with a slice of orange and a slice of cantaloupe. 

Customers are starting to come in at 7:15. Food is good and customer service is excellent. I will certainly come again."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast place if you're feeling lazy and want to go out for a quick bkft

Ordered the big bkft and classic 3 eggs.  Nothing overly memorable but everything was done well.  Coffee was good,  pancake was decent,  a bit on the thinner side but the French fries were the best - they had a crunchy coating and were well seasoned and fresh and hot out of the fryer. 

They also have this monster fresh orange juice machine... Might try it next time. 

All in all,  decent breakfast place but no real specialty breakfast items, if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Recently moved to this area and I've been to this place a few times already! The breakfast is always amazing, good coffee too. The owner Cassie is a delight to talk to, I can see myself becoming a regular here!"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonably priced, the staff is working hard and try their best. 
For sure worth repeating."}
{"text":"No early bird breakfast special on weekends. That was the first disappointment that hit me immediately. Then the atmosphere wasn't great as there was no music playing. Service was excellent though, but service can't save this place. Home fries were undercooked and my omelette lacked cheese. I won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Just what the star rating I've rated suggests: I've experiences better.

Went out to this place and right off the bat the staff were friendly. It took them awhile to bring us our menus and our bill when we asked for it. My friend's and I went around noon...it was not busy. Maybe 5-6 tables at most were occupied.

If you're feeling lazy and want some eggs, sure, this place can do that for you. But seeing as I can make some regular ole eggs or an omelette at home, I wanted to order something more \"extravagant\". 

Our table felt that the sausages were too salty, fatty, and oily. But hey, if that's what you're looking for especially after a rough night, go for it! We were quite disappointed by their potatoes that came on the side of practically everything. They were just you're plain jane potatoes. Nothing fancy. I got some mushroom and spinach bennies. Pretty good for average stuff. If I was served this at someone's home, they'd be good. But for a restaurant, I expected better. The hollandaise sauce....well, if you don't like mayo, I wouldn't suggest getting a benny. Lastly, the pancakes. We ordered some blueberry pancakes which came out very \"golden brown\" ...borderline burnt. And they still served them to us. I've added a picture of our meals here. The blueberries were very sour, but I guess it's not blueberry season? 

Overall, we were not a huge fan of this place and would most likely not come again. Mostly because we have a few better brunch places closer to us. There's a really good, small family owned brunch joint in Unionville on Hwy 7 if people would like to give it a go. Cheaper prices than here and their potatoes are AMAZING. The best potatoes at a brunch joint I've had thus far and for the price? You can't go wrong. Be aware that this place can get busy with the locals in the area..and new comers as well. 

Cheers."}
{"text":"1st time here but have driven by many times. Ordered breakfast item, omelet with Swiss and mushrooms, added spinach. I loved that it wasn't salted so I could add my own! Very tasty. Potatoes seasoned nicely cooked perfectly; fruit garnish. Thankful they had Splenda, my fave sweetener. Coffee refilled, prompt service, large screen TV with CP24 news, clean, quiet music. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Good quality all day breakfast, great service, quick, attentive, polite and friendly. Highly recommend the eggs benedict, good options, peameal bacon was outstanding."}
{"text":"Before I begin I would implore any establishment not to betray a fundamental rule of basic hygiene . A sign of respect for your customers is to ensure that the silverware is wiped and clean. The second is to honestly convey the product as described in the menu or place a requisite photo of the product. 

Spoons in coffee: if we are going to be bold and place a spoon in the small coffee cup, please avoid placing a spoon that is filthy and crusted with food. Some people do not place sugar in the coffee, just serve the coffee on a small dish. In my years, I have never beenade more I'll than the sight of a crusted spoon, filthy in a cup of coffee. Why, o Lord why can an establishment not respect it's customers than not to wipe a spoo.

Omelette. Ok, a smoked salmon omelette sounds interesting, but what I saw was an omelette with slices of salmon lazily placed in the omeltte, not within. Basically a plain omeltte with salty salmon and aged provolone for a salt bomb. Not to mention undergone potatoes and a broken hollandaise sauce on the Benny. 

Prices do not appear to reflect the quality of foodstuffs or service from the lovely family whom operate the restaurant. For $50.00 for three for breakfast, please note that a soiled spoon and a basic home fry are not the way to attract repeat customers.

{"text":"Ok and simple diner place.. Nothing glamorous, setting is friendly and easy. Selection of breakfast is from your typical 3eggs, potatoes and toast to fried rice. Will come again to try other menu."}
{"text":"Discovered this place yesterday and what a gem! Great for catching up with friends because they never made us once feel rushed. The minute we walked in we were greeted warmly and nicely accommodated. I think it is a family business, but all the staff were friendly. They tried to avoid seating us by the door so we wouldn't feel a draft which is so nice. The place was pretty packed for breakfast hour but quieted down after noon. One of our servers was so nice and made an exception so I could get half and half between sausage and peameal bacon since I couldn't decide. Would definitely recommend this place if you want to support locals and an independent business! Solid classic greasy breakfast joint with a nice variety of menu options."}
{"text":"Very delicious breakfast with a sizeable amount for an omelette. I wasn't too hungry so I was able to share one order. Overall very satisfying taste and service! The fruits were al very delicious and fresh, with exception to the orange, it being sour. However still very yummy :)"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Very reasonable price and food is very tasty and well presentation, hot from the kitchen. Very busy place, seated in 1 min but waited 30 mins for food to come to the table. I was  really hungry at that time, so the food tasted extraordinarily well. The only thing not good is that they are under staffed, the waiter is always running to try to complete all the tasks. He was quite rushing when taking the order, but polite and trying his best.  The fruit is very unfresh and home fries were undercooked, lack of flavor.  We are not sure if we will 
come back in some point of future time."}
{"text":"A place similar to Eggsmart, and the food here is a lot better. Every time I've been there, it never makes me disappointed."}
{"text":"I really love this little diner. It's a family owned business and the owners are very friendly.  

The food is reasonably priced and the portions are huge.  They have real freshly squeezed orange juice (not the fake stuff that other local places charge an arm and a leg for) and the coffee is really good (which is really important to me). They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner but I have only eaten breakfast there so far.  I love that they don't charge extra for turkey bacon. The bacon and eggs were good but the strawberry and banana pancakes  which I had on my first visit were amazing with lots of fresh fruit on top. 

The place is bright, cheerful and clean. I feel good about spending my money here. I want them to succeed because this area needs more restaurants like this."}
{"text":"This is my favourite breakfast place! The foods are always fresh and I like the fries so much, probably the best in town. Family run business, GoSan, the owner is very friendly and I feel very welcomed each time I go."}
