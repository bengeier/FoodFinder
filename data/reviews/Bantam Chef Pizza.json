{"text":"I came here a few times when it opened and thought it was pretty good. My fianc√© and I visited again on a whim tonight and probably won't be back after this.   The restaurant was totally empty when we got there. After a few minutes, someone came from the back to take our order at the counter. Although we were dining in, he didn't ask us about drinks, and when I asked for two ice waters, we were charged an extra dollar \"for the cups.\" We seated ourselves and discovered that, despite being empty, not a single table was clean. We chose the least dirty and tried to wipe it off with napkins, but it had a sticky residue, as if it had been last cleaned with a dirty rag. The entire restaurant looks really run-down, and the tables add to that image. Several of the soda choices were out on the drink machine, and there was no tea available, so even if we had paid for drinks, we couldn't have gotten what we wanted. There were only two wrapped silverware sets available, and one, when unwrapped, had food stuck to it that had not come off at the last washing.   I maintained hope for the food, based on past experiences, but was disappointed with that too. It took over 20 minutes for two calzones, but when they arrived, the outside was nearly burnt, but they were not very hot. I ordered a ham, onion, and extra cheese calzone; the onion was still entirely raw and cold, and there was no more cheese on mine than on my fiance's meat calzone. The filling had no flavor and needed salt. The marinara sauce, which was also cold, lacked seasoning and flavor as well. While the food was acceptable and edible, it was not enjoyable.   While we were there, at least two employees were there. Other than taking our order, they did not speak to us at all. When we left, both were in the back.   I typically don't write negative Yelp reviews, because I prefer to just let things work out on their own or call the manager, but a sign next to the register says \"Complaints will be heard next Tuesday,\" so I don't really think they care about customer experience anyways."}
{"text":"Excellent  pizza and wings. Always make just the way I asked.  Very nice employees.  I always recommend to every for the best pizza and wings to go here"}
