{"text":"We have missed the Picasso's that opened briefly in Cornelius, so we searched this one out.  It was like a Goldilocks story.  Some sports bars are too crowded and too noisy for a relaxing dinner for two.  Others are too quiet, too boring.  This one seems just right.  They have the same good food we had enjoyed in Cornelius, a good beer selection, an attractive-enough layout, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken wings in town. Hands down. Also the homemade potato chips are a must for when you come to watch whatever game you want. One of the waitresses, Brianna I think is her name, always greets with a cheshire smile and a cold budweiser!"}
{"text":"This is my umpteenth time coming here.  I have never had a bad experience. Food is only decent that's why it is not 5 stars. Bartenders are friendly. Drink prices could be better but they have specials occasionally.  I keep coming back so it can't be that bad.   Btdubbs. This is my virgin yelp."}
{"text":"I have been eating and playing poker at Picasso's for over a year now . . . and at the Uptown location for longer than that. I should say that I'm not a sports fan . . . I come here to play poker and spend time with my poker buddies a couple of nights a week. BUT, for those who are sports fans and like to eat/drink while watching a game,  you should be very happy with this place. Picasso's is very popular with the college-aged sports fan crowd -- particularly since it's located just up the road from UNC-Charlotte. The food is standard sports-bar fare. Wings, pizzas, sandwiches, wraps, fries and other appetizers. These are of fairly average quality -- though I have heard some of my friends comment that they particularly like the fajitas. There are no desserts. There is a good selection of beer & mixed drinks -- nothing fancy, but adequate and fairly priced for your average sports fan. The staff is very friendly and professional and are able to accomodate large crowds with ease -- given a little advanced notice. As I mentioned, my poker league plays here twice a week (on Mondays and Wednesdays, 2 games each day at 7pm and 9:30pm FREE) and we usually have crowd of 20-30. Often, other college groups (clubs, fraternities, sports teams, etc.) share the same space.  It's a spacious establishments with lots of TVs and even a huge (I'd say 10 ft or bigger) projection TV for the big games.  In addition to the games on the TVs and twice-weekly free poker, there is also an electronic darts board and a \"shuffleboard\" game. The covered outdoor seating area is convenient if you happen to be a smoker or have smokers in your party.   SO . . . being a foodie, I'd give Picasso's 3 stars. Since this place is a SPORTS BAR, however, and judging it on its' own merits, I'll give Picasso's 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best sportsbar in CLT. They really know how to take care of their loyal patrons. If there is a particular game of interest on TV somewhere in the world, they will put it on for you, no questions asked. And, if you are a Charlotte 49ers fan, this is the place to be. So, to the guys @ the door, the waitresses, and the bartenders ... You guys make it happen and we appreciate it."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and was lucky enough to have this bar across the street from my long stay at the Marriott. Now that I have moved I still come back because the service is outstanding and the pizza is wonderful. If you are looking for a sports bar, this is the one to go to. You won't be disappointed,"}
{"text":"They've got plenty of screens and channels to get whatever event you wanna watch. Food is solid pub grub and they're quick about it. Friendly staff, whether you're new or a regular. Everything you want in a sports bar. Need to add more local beers is my only suggestion."}
{"text":"if I could give this negative stars I would... aside from the grown man that was sitting against the front door entrance that not only had he thrown up all over the entrance outside but  also himself.. if tangs not enough to tie. you off the place was disgustingly dirty.. to save time and effort il give one huge example of how dirty this place was by saying that if our shoes had not been tied to our feet; we would have stepped right out of them.. that's how sticky and filthy just the floor alone was.. I understand this is a bar but there was no one in there so I just can't figure out why it wasn't a little cleaner. all the waffle houses I've been to we're far more sanitary than this place; and that's saying a lot.."}
{"text":"Well since no one would wait on us, we left. Seriously? You'll buss a table right in front of us but completely ignore customers. Un-flipping-believable."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was awesome. I walked in with a large group today to watch the second half of  USA vs New Zealand rugby, so I expected a mild wait for food. The waiter was super nice and the free shuffle board like game was alot of fun. However after I ordered, all these good things dissolved away like the flavor of gum once you've chewed for 5 minutes. Two of the TVs directly facing us ended up being SD instead of HD, which was not the worst thing by far, but really grinded my gears . I knew I had to wait longer for my food because of the group I was with, but I literally ordered a burger on a piece of bread and chips (patty melt). When it came out it was missing cheese and had 1 onion slice. The bread was untoasted and unbuttered and unsatisfying. The burger was well-to-burnt, dry and also unsatisfying. The chips were very good and the water was also unsatisfying, probably because of how terrible the experience was. I can't believe I paid 9.45 for a burger and bread, the simplest thing on the menu, and they managed to mess that up. Not only did they mess it up, but the management took an hour and a half of my life to do so. Seemed like a cool place, but it was overpriced, understaffed and under my expectations. I Will not go again."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times since it was right up the road from where I was staying. Amazing staff and the food is very good. I have enjoyed myself each time I came here. Definitely will be back when I am in this area again. Such a friendly place and staff made me feel like I was very welcomed each time. Keep up the great work and great food. Thank you"}
{"text":"Great service and staff. Wings are amazing. Everyone else not getting wings was getting pepperoni rolls. I'll try them next time because they looked unbelievable."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow but the food was Great!!! Definitely could stand to hire a few more employees."}
{"text":"The best combination of sports & FOOD!  Staff is always personable & attentive. They attract a wide variety of fans, but always friendly people. 'Kind of unusual for any bar."}
{"text":"It was casual and ages were around 30 to 60, no one getting overly excited. The sitting areas were comfortable with the bar being the main focus but up a few steps closer to the TV. The really attentive waiter I think was the manager and he was cooking, taking orders, serving, and cleaning up but had a casual attitude like he really enjoyed the crowd.  EVERY one treated him like family. The burger I ate was exceptional and I expected bar food. There is a nice variety of dishes like a restaurant should have but also simple things like pizza, appetizers, and wings. Drinks were simple it seems but I had a soda, I don't drink. I went to check out the loudness which was only loud during touchdown and it was college bowl games. Very nice customers and they were some of the regular crowd so they seemed to genuinely care about the manager and the waitress and each other. There were two families with young children sitting down on the bottom area and one couple had a baby and seems like the crowd got a little quieter. But still there were touchdowns! Overall enjoyed the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We feel at home here when we visit Charlotte. Great food, clean, comfy atmosphere, Ken & Evan treat you well, and fun locals. See you next time!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place.  It's an actual sports bar, in a part of town choking to death on crappy franchise restaurants.  Expect efficient, friendly staff, seriously good pizza and wings, and good drink specials.  It's a busy bar, so if you're looking for a sub-2 minute greet on a Friday night, go to Chili's.  The service at Picasso's is good, but it's not A) a family restaurant, B) a frozen drink/flair/appletini bar, or C) a 'College' bar.  It's a sports bar, so tip well, enjoy the food, and get ready for the bartenders to know your name and your drink the next time you come in."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for local UNCC students or a nice place to go and hang out with friends or your significant other.  It is a great place to watch whatever game you want because they have tons of TVs as well as the largest projection TV I have seen thus far in Charlotte.  I have only tried the wings and the pizza and they are definitely on point.  The pizza is oven baked, so it has a unique taste that only Picasso's can provide.  I would give it five stars if the service was a little more consistent.  Sometimes you will sit down at a table and it takes forever for someone to come over, while at other times the service is stellar.  If you are looking for awesome pizza or wings in the University area, this is your spot."}
{"text":"Caribbean creeper wings are awesome!! Just gotta watch cuz they all talk a lot and it hard for them to see the drunk assholes sometimes"}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to a neighborhood sports bar in the University area of Charlotte, Picasso's Sports Café. This wings and pizza sports bar also features sandwiches, salads, and a list of starters.  Dora here. Tucked into the bottom floor of a ginormous shopping center, we almost missed this place. So glad we didn't because it reminded me of a modern \"Cheers.\" We appreciated that it wasn't dark and stale like some sports bars and offered plenty of tables near the windows. With televisions of all sizes, this cafe would be a great place to catch a game, especially if you get there early like us. lol.  As our starter, we chose the Breadstix with homemade dough, topped with mozzarella and cheddar cheese, garlic butter and served with a side of marinara. This appetizer was great, kind of like a cheese pizza with outstanding dough. Dora here. Yum. Who can complain about a buttery crust and two kinds of cheese? Not me!  For my lunch, I ordered the Wing & Fry Basket, which included 6 garlic parmesan wings and tater tots. The buffalo sauce mixed in with the garlic and parmesan gave the wings quite the kick, really good flavor. The tater tots were crispy, just how I like them.  Dora here. The pepperoni roll was a good balance if you're craving something pizza-ish, not overly doughy or cheesy. But, unless you're really hungry, you might want to share this jumbo roll. Especially if you order the Breadstix appetizer...carb overload. Don't judge! lol.

{"text":"I have visited this bar several times and must say I'm a big fan of this bar.  It is your average sports bar, with average drink prices.  Their bar food is out of this world.  Don't believe me?  Try the pizza rolls, buffalo chicken rolls, or wings.  Or all three.  Seriously.  Stopped there in the daytime once however to pick up some of the aforementioned deliciousness, and was put off by their carpet in the morning.  If you've had a bit to much too drink, don't stare at the carpeting while making your way to the loo.  You might fall over.    Been here to watch some Phillies games before and even though the bartender was a Yankees fan, it was still a nice experience.  I will definitely go back to this place in the future."}
{"text":"Going to Picasso's was a real experience. When we walked in...we just walked in. No hostes what so ever. Everyone's been to a sports bar before, this was a little strange to me. None the less we found seats close to the big screen. It seems like there's thousands of tv's in this place! I think there were only two servers working that day. But they had it all under control. It's kind of a do as you please atmosphere. Everyone had on a jersey representing their team, it was live! I ordered the two foods their known for. Pizza. Wings. I had a medium cheese pie and the cajun garlic wing basket (or whatever it's called). The pizza, not really all that great. It was just a step up, maybe two, from frozen pizza. ( Our waitress noted that the dough is made in house dailey). Just didn't hit the spot for me. The wings on the other hand...marvelous! I don't know if I'd say the best in Charlotte, but they were pretty good! Sadly when I got to the bottom of my wing baskey ( because I ate all of them), my very last wing had a rather large feather still attached. This rendered it inedible in my book. Overall great spot. I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Spent my college days going to this place all the time. Always a fun environment and the staff is always great. Wings are excellent."}
{"text":"Went for first time today to watch football. Plenty of tv's. Good burger, very good wings, and nice people. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"If your looking for a place to watch a game or just to have a few beers and dont have to deal with the downtown traffic Picasso's is the spot the have amazing food and cold beer on the tap, try the fried mushrooms they are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Karen T. is obviously a self absorbed negative nancy.  Tell me what a sports bar should look like.  The decor is fine and whoever the server was probably reflected the bad attitude that was presented to them.  The food is great here.  The wings and pizza are far superior to those in most sports bars.  For the record, I don't work here but I am a fan of the joint.."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch today on a whim. I've been here only once before and it was at night and too much of a just-out-of-college scene for me so I really had no desire to go again. But after looking for a warm meal on a chilly deal, I was willing to give it another shot. They have a huge selection of salads and burgers plus they have a lunch special of the day for $6.99 which comes with a side of your choice. Luckily, the special today was a fried chicken sandwich topped with bacon and cheese which was perfect for my fatty, greasing craving I had. We had quick, attentive service but the thing that stood out to me the most was the inside. Hello Batcave! It was so dark in there that and after a hefty portion of food all I wanted to do was huddle up under one of the tables and take a nappy nap. In and out in less than 45 minutes--I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"It was clean and neat. Our waitress didn't know a lot about the beers or specials. Still had posters and ads up for St. Patrick's day and a special glass with purchase that ended a month ago. Also had Easter specials up. This is on April 7 mind you. Food was typical bar food. Not great and not horrible."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Food good. Just wish they had baked wings.  Friendly staff.  Clean place."}
{"text":"He said: It was good to find a place near the hotel to kill some time waiting for check-in.  We had read the pepperoni roll \"was to die for\", but decided that was a little over-stated, for sure.  It was tasty and satisfying, but if I came back I wouldn't feel like I had to get it again.  We requested the onion rings extra crispy and instead got them cooked the standard way.  Other than those minor bumps, our waitress was great (I would call her out by name if I could, but she deserved the tip we gave), the food was satisfactory, and having NoDa on tap was a major plus.  All in all, deserving the 3 stars.  She said: We were hungry, and this was nearby. The tap selection wasn't fantastic, but that didn't matter because the NoDa Hop, Drop, and Roll was on tap and that's all that I needed. We had my youngest with me, and he's @BurgerPursuit on Twitter (a boy in search of the perfect burger), so he had a burger and found it to be acceptable. Our waitress made the visit more than pleasant with her charm, and the food was satisfactory. Not great, but not bad at all. We sat outside because the dog was with us, so I can't comment on the interior ambiance.  Potty Points: It was a serviceable bathroom. Not pristine, but not awful. I'll give it three out of five potty points."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Hot fresh loved it!  Great beer selection.  Older white bar tender with glasses has a very crass vocabulary.  Will go back when he is not there. Other bartender was awesome."}
{"text":"Poor food quality but excellent service. Just like an typical sports bar around nothing to impressive. Sandwich was undercooked, got a fried chicken which ended up having two wet chicken cutlets on it that tasted like they were sitting in water all day."}
{"text":"Great services and Good comfort food Highly recommended went with kids and enjoyed our stay!!!"}
{"text":"I found this place due to a friend and have been hooked since... great pizza and wings  (from NY so pizza is a big thing) great atmosphere and great people. If you go get the masterpiece pizza and honey chipotle wings.. I promise you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best bar to pregame for Panthers games...  Now that I officially have season ticks to the Panthers, and have been to every game during the 2012 season, I finally feel qualified to comment on the bar scene around Bank of America Stadium on game days.    I like Picasso's Uptown because it is well within walking distance from the stadium - no more than 5 min.  They also have their own lot, just to left of the building.  The atmosphere is always lively and they have an abundance of HD screens draped throughout.      Once inside Picasso's on a Sunday afternoons, you are greeted by a crowd of patrons boozing, eating, carousing and of course, football watching.  As far as the food is concerned, I like the bacon cheese fries as well as the wings.  The wings are always well cooked, crisp and well-sauced.  I definitely recommend them if you are a wing lover.  The Ace of Clubs is an excellent sandwich as well.  In addition to having exceptional bar food, P3 (as the regulars call it) also has reasonably priced, cold beer, and other spirits.    Whenever I'm asked about a good spot to go to for football before, during or after Panthers games, Picasso's Uptown is always my answer."}
{"text":"This is a perfectly awesome sports bar.  You can go there for any big game for any sport, and they will have it on one of their many screens WITH SOUND!!  They even have a roll-down projection screen towards the rear of the bar that shows the big games as well.  I recently went to Picassos one week night, and ordered a beer and an order of a dozen Cajun Garlic wings w/ranch.  This is a tasty sauce I've had many times so I knew what I was given.  The wings were brought to me pipping hot and the ranch was thick and cold.  There's nothing I despise more than a warm, runny ranch.  The wings were cooked with the perfect amount of crispiness but were not overcooked by any means.    My only complaint with the wings is that they are not charred.  I'm sorry to say, but if you're not throwing your wings over an open-flame and charring them at this point then you're simply behind the times.  Plenty of establishments such as Fanz, Hickory Tavern and Mac's throw their wings over a grill before serving them.  If your looking for a chill and relaxing WEEKDAY evening to watch your favorite team, Picassos is the perfect place.  On football Sundays, Picasso's University is nothing short of perfectly organized mayhem.  Fans often arrived at 11am-11:30am even though their game doesn't kick-off until 1pm!  Furthermore, you are very likely to see a skirmish or a squabble as Sunday day turns into Sunday evening and patrons start to get that liquor courage.   Before I close, I want to make an important distinction in my rating.  I give Picasso's Sports Cafe as a whole  5-stars.  The staff is always friendly, prompt and efficient.  However, I am not giving their Cajun Garlic Wings 5-stars!  Though their wings are good, there are not \"5-star\" worthy.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give them a 7.  At its soul, this is a classic, American sports-bar.  Good food, done right."}
{"text":"I had not been to Picasso's in a couple of years and was quickly reminded on what I've been missing out on. It was fairly busy but not packed. I had the wings & fry combo and they were amazing. Steak cut fries and giant chicken wings. The sauce was excellent and I must give a s/o to the staff. Service was quick and friendly. Very excited to come back"}
{"text":"This Was By Far The Worst Place I've Been Too , I Came With An Out Of State ID and was Told That NORTH CAROLINA LAW states they can not take out of state ID's , when questioned the bouncer , he continued to lie saying it's a law but I know for sure that's not a law because people from all over come to visit North Carolina with an out of state I'd and get serviced ! Would not recommend anyone to this LYING BUSINESS!"}
{"text":"I travel quite a bit for work, and I really like finding a place I feel is worthy of becoming my \"local\" hangout.  Picasso's is it for me.  Almost every Monday night, wing special...and the wings are probably my favorite, ever.  I love to get the salt-n-pepper wings and dip them myself...keeps the crunch.  Staff is awesome too!!"}
{"text":"Smells terrible weird mixture of nail polish and sour beer. Wings were kind expensive but were supposed to be big and the best thing on the menu. They were small over cooked and broken. Nasty. Overpriced small portions. And the food was bad."}
{"text":"Awesome environment. Bathroom smells like absolute piss. Would have rated this place a 5 otherwise."}
{"text":"Although it was very empty, it took 20 minutes just to put in my order. Instead of asking if I was ready to order or waiting for me to ask, he ran by the table and said he would be back. The only reason I stayed was because my son wanted wings and I heard the wings and cheesestix were the best... me and the boys were not disappointed. And even though he got my order wrong, they fixed it and got me the right food which was delicious! The food and atmosphere gave them a four star but the service brought it down one. Great place to watch the game and get some yummy cheesestix and wings!! The service also got better!!"}
{"text":"What's not to like here? Stellar draft beer list, good food (I had the Cobb salad with chicken), and nice atmosphere. I am not sure if they are always playing such rad 80's music, but they were jammin Sheena E, Prince, Journey, and even George Michael. I realized, at that point, that 80's music was extremely tame and innocent compared to the tripe on the radio today. Where's the \"Walking on Sunshine\"? Where's the \"Faith\" (not  Limp Bizkit style)? Where's Elizabeth Shue and her \"Cruel Summer\"? Where's the \"Billie Jean\" for cryin out loud (actually, that one is a bit filthy for 80's innocence)? Nice place to catch a game and some cold beers."}
{"text":"Awesome wings!!!!  Not the best customer service, but great food, great TVs, and great location!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game or just grab a good bite to eat. The prices are reasonable and the amount of food you get for the price is pretty good. I would suggest the wings and the cheese fries...the fries were rather awesome."}
{"text":"After a 10.5 hour drive to Charlotte from up state NY at 10pm we were hungry and thirsty. This was the perfect place. Nice atmosphere, great TVS with all different sports. Place wasn't wild or crazy, it was low key, good crowd and the food was GREAT!  We had the chicken parm roll. Dough was excellent and the portion was just right. Nice introduction to the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"Really pleasantly surprised. Truly, 3.5 stars but it didn't seem fair to round down to 3 stars.  Short version: Its a sports bar that offers friendly service, good portions and good food. Good for hanging out to watch the games or just a super casual meal. Note: IDs are checked on Sundays; must be 21 and over.  Long version: Hubs and I walked in late afternoon during a football game. Vibe was a bit divey and I expected the worst. I comforted myself by reminding myself of all their good reviews. I was pleasantly surprised. Once we seated ourselves, we were taken care off rather quickly and everyone that came to the table was really friendly and checked on us often. We ordered medium garlic wings and tater tots to start. The wings were great! Really crispy with just enough sauce. The tots were perfectly crisp without being greasy or soggy in the inside. For entrees, we had the bacon mushroom swiss burger (no swiss) with veggie medley for myself, and classic burger with fries for the hubs. Both burger were over cooked and, were nothing to write home about, but by no means bad. They were just ok. The veggie medley was just your standard normandy blend with a sprinkle of salt and pepper over top. The fries were ok. Not the best, not the worst.  Overall, its sports bar food that doesn't necessarily excite (except for the wings and tots) but doesn't disappoint either.  Will definitely return to try some other items and report back."}
{"text":"Intimate seating with multiple entrances. Service was good and the meal was fantastic. Bacon cheese burger and fries made to order. Wish they had better drink specials for liquor."}
{"text":"Ashley was friendly & checked on her customers fluidly. I grabbed a couple of beers & a quick convo while I waited on some calzones (yum!!!) to go. Great way to start my weekend!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely an excellent sports bar. There are TVs everywhere you turn, and is an especially raucous place to watch a big game.   They do have live music intermittently on weekends, but it is much more a sports bar than live music venue.  My band performed there in May, during the NBA Finals. We were slated to go on at 10, after the first game but before the second game came on, which meant they would turn down the sound on the TVs. I thought we were going to get bum-rushed when some people learned what was going on.   It turned out okay in the end, but it was an interesting evening to say the least.  Food-wise, the pizza and wings are delicious! I had excessive quantities of both, as well as draft beer.  Apart from the sports crowd, it seems this place does quite a bit of late-night business, as a lot of people make it one of their last stops of the evening before heading home to sleep it off.  Overall, a good scene, and definitely worth a stop just for the pizza and wingies."}
{"text":"Went here before watching the Carolina Panthers.  We had the wings Honey Chipolte BBQ and traditional Buffalo wings, the wings were very big and the sauces were excellent.  The buffalo sauce used here seems to have less vinegar but it was still good.  We also ordered some cheese breadsticks which came out very good.  The two negatives, if going here during game day it gets very crowded, want to come in around 10:30am.  Second negative but not their fault is they do not serve Beer until 12:00 noon, which means you will have less than hour to get your fill before going to the 1:00pm games"}
{"text":"Since I eat here fairly often (mostly for lunch), I think it's time to do a quick review.  I think that Picasso's has the best chicken wings in Charlotte.  Good variety of flavors (17 at last count), meaty, always well prepared (and can do extra crispy if you want...)! I go for the Honey Chipolte myself, but the pineapple kickers and carribean creepers also get very good marks with me!!  The staff here is very attentive and I've almost always had good service.  There was this one time... but hey, it was a new waitress..., so they get a break!  Great place to watch a game, or several as there are screens all around!  Now, in my opinion, although the place isn't what you'd call plush, it has always been clean as far as I could tell.  Plenty of seating, great for a group!"}
{"text":"Nice sports bar/grill. Friendly staff. Very efficient service. Fun names on the drink menu. Pizzas and wings are both very good! I have been several times and had good service each time. Every time I go they give same great service!!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere here it is very average, pretty much what you'd expect from a sports bar. The service is friendly and the prices are very good for the Uptown area. The thing that makes this place great is the food and they almost always get your order right even when it is customized:. Their ranch dressing is the best in town and the wing sauce is great also. The blackened chicken has the perfect amount of seasoning, also try the pizza and cheese bread but make sure you ask for it well done. The place could be a little cleaner but again it is a sports bar atmosphere, not upscale or even middle scale."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great, LOTS of tvs for sporting events including a very large projector/screen for main events. Bartenders are friendly and attentive and do a great job. This place is highly suggested!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. I had their buffalo shrimp and it was amazing. They claim to have the meatiest wings, I will be checking that out next time.Love this place,I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Great bar, good drinks, good service, good music, & for a sports bar- great decorations. Not to be bias, but I saw plenty of Yankees signs which is always a plus in my book, especially in NC. I came on a Thursday night & I figured it would be more packed, but school has yet to begin so I'm hoping that's the reason why. Anyway, great great potential for this bar. I look forward to returning when school begins."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. The atmosphere is genuine, not a corporate sports bar. The bartenders are entertaining and good at what they do.  Have tried multiple things on the menu and have been more than satisfied. I love supporting local businesses"}
{"text":"My job as a professional sand sculptor takes me all over the world. When on the road, I look two things, great food and friendly people. This place had all that and more. This is definitely my new favorite spot in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Seriously people. Way too many stars here. Look. I have made nachos at home with Tostitos cheese etc before and liked it. But, I guess when I go out I expect more. Geez. Don't serve that.  Use some real cheese and bake those nachos. That was bad. When you order nachos and they come out in 30 seconds they are never good. That theory proved to be true tonight. Bar staff were awesome. Beer prices good too. But. After that mess I only stayed for one beer."}
{"text":"THE BEST WINGS IN THE QC!!! My friends ad I joke about how perfect they are...but seriously. How do they get them so perfect? EVERYTIME! Perfect amount of sauce, fried crispy, with that ranch! OMG! This is a great lunch spot, or place to watch the games if you'e into sports. Bartenders remember you and take great care of you. Love it! Dammit! I want some wings now! LOL"}
{"text":"Great place to have a beer after work...thats about it.   Food was ok...nothing exciting or special.   Service was good.....I may go back, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"A true sports bar with plenty of character; I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"It's really a place to watch sports have drinks. That's it didn't like the food there. It's probably cause its just meant for sports and drinks. Since I'm not a fan of either its definitely the wrong place for me. But for those who like drinks and sports this would be your spot!"}
{"text":"Great for watching sports. Everywhere has a view of a TV.  Garlic wings are thumbs up. I've had a good burger & fries also. Stick with beer or basic drinks as bartenders don't seem to do \"fancy\" cocktails."}
{"text":"I have definitely missed the Picasso's on East so I was delighted to stop into this location.  Tucked into a strip mall on East WT Harris it is very easy to find with lots of parking.  There was a pretty good beer selection - two IPAs on tap (the bartender admitted he would like more).  This would be a great place to watch the game.  There were TVs everywhere.  Service was fast and friendly.  I was thrilled they had the pepperoni rolls on the menu and had even expanded the rolls menu!  The pepperoni rolls here are amazing.    Will definitely be back!  :-D"}
{"text":"Service isn't the greatest. If you don't drink beer, drink specials can be somewhat lacking as well. Food is usually pretty good. Nachos are awesome. Wings are great. The pizza is always good too. The lunch buffet isn't a bad deal. Lots of TVs and a nice outdoor area."}
{"text":"I went to Picasso yesterday as a single lady just to get a drink & some food. The service is terrible! This is my second time going. Every time I go the lady behind the bar looks like her dog just died. It took forever for them to come to me. I didn't get one smile from either bartender. The roll I had was good. But I can find good food elsewhere I prefer good service!"}
{"text":"It is so hard to find places that have a good selection on salads. I had the chef and it was awesome. They put good meat on it. Also had pickle chips. These are so good. Thank you for a fun trivia night with great music. Custo.er service is great too!"}
{"text":"It was our first night in Charlotte, arriving late and hungry, we opted to go to Picassos, not knowing anything about it.  The atmosphere for a Thursday night was very casual. It was typical of sports type bars with sports on every TV, but was more laid back with country music playing at a level that still allowed for conversation without having to yell. It was also very clean; tables weren't sticky or anything like that. Also the staff and patrons all seemed very polite and courteous; nothing loud or obnoxious.  Our server Finley was amazing. He was well versed in the menu items, as well as local beers. He did a great job at recommending items for us to try, and was very attentive. The food was great. Per Finley, everything is homemade but the cheese, and it tasted that way. Nothing tasted out of the box or can - it was all very fresh. We had the spinach & artichoke dip, Caribbean wings, and a veggie pizza (see images). All were great. Would highly recommend especially for late night dinners."}
{"text":"Nice place food I'm not so sure of  I ordered the philly cheese steak  over cooked dry cheese steak I practically didn't even see any cheese in it and the bread was microwaved then put on the grill boi do I hate that but a redemption moment for them would be the burgers two people ordered burgers and by the looks of those burgers that's what I should've ate"}
{"text":"Wings....beers....bartender that makes sure you don't get thristy.....I really like this place."}
{"text":"Ok, I admit, I am not a sports bar person.  Heck, I am not so much of a sports person.  But I am a huge fan of wings, and thus I sought out a place that had pretty decent ones.  This led me to try Picasso's to see what it's all about.  And I have got to say, they have some pretty good ones.  Thus far, I have tried three different kinds.  The Caribbean Creepers were like eating a jerk chicken wing, but they were just a little too different for me.  The medium garlic were pretty good, but the best I have had, by far, are the Cajun Garlic.  They are the perfect level of spiciness, not too spicy but plenty of flavor.    I have tried some of their other things here too.  Their bacon cheese fries were kind of 'meh' when I had them; they were pretty skimpy on the cheese and bacon.  Their pizza was pretty decent.  We had the Masterpiece, had a lot of good toppings.  Still, I am not a huge fan of New York-style pizza (I originate from the Midwest, and am quite partial toward Chicago-style or deep dish), but it was pretty standard for pizza.  Service has been ok here.  I have never had bad service, so that is definitely a plus.  They do have a decent amount of seating too, and it's not overly crowded in there.  I plan to try a few more things on their menu, and that definitely includes other styles of their wings.  Their wings are good, but I must continue on my quest for amazing wings here in Charlotte.  Overall, I would give Picasso's about 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, hands down the best wings in Charlotte. Reasonable beer prices, great staff."}
{"text":"Big screen is a plus, not many crafted beer. Had a wonderful night here for the NCAA final four night. Go Devil!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and have never been disappointed. Their wings are always good and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The Honey Chipotle are the best!  Their pepperoni pizza roll is a must! The service at this place is top notch! Even during big games when they're crowded the servers seem to be very attentive. Although it's not the biggest place, they do have plenty of tvs to watch the big game."}
{"text":"Visited here back in November with 6 friends of mine.  Free pool table and shuffleboard was a plus but what made it truly enjoyable was the amount of tvs and the staff.  Everyone was friendly and didn't mind us getting loud.  Good drink specials and above decent food makes this a great time.  If we ever come back to Charlotte, we'll most likely be found here causing a scene."}
{"text":"Amazing bartender and food. I ordered the lemon pepper wings with their homemade chips. Let's just say i came back the same week and order the same to go. I love how they have wing that are bigger then your other wing places in the area . So worth the price. I am interested to try another flavor next time. I do had they charge an additional $1 to have 2 flavors on your wings that are already $12 for a dozen but they are very tasty."}
{"text":"Picasso's is cool, my girlfriend used to live in the area so we frequently visit Charlotte. Picasso's is a great place with lots of TV's, seating and games. The drinks are inexpensive and the food looked good. My only complaint is that they didn't have the UFC fight on there. Had to walk to Buffalo Wild Wings"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Picasso's since moving to Charlotte in 2009.  I was looking for an after work place to eat wings and have a drink where I felt as at home as I did in Greensboro.  I absolutely found it here !  The staff is very friendly, and the food is great.  I've since met many new friends there, which made the transition to a new town much easier.  I highly recommend it! !"}
{"text":"I am the biggest fan of the Picasso's on East Blvd.  Great Food, Great Staff, Great sports atmosphere.  Was tailgating for the Panther's game on Sunday and a large group(about 16) of local Panther fans decided to head into the Uptown location to watch the game.  Thinking its a Picasso's, should be fun.  We were looking forward to continuing the boozing with some great bar food inside.  When we came in we noticed that the sound and main BIG screen TV was tuned too the Eagles vs Giants game.  When we notified the management that this in fact was Charlotte NC and not New York or Philly, they said sorry but this is a better game and 2 Eagles fans had requested it.  The bar staff was not even interested in the fact that there where 16 people about to spend money, while watching and supporting their local team and city.  We immediately walked out and the bar lost anywhere from $700-$1000 of business because we like to eat and drink.  I understand that the Panther's had a tough year and there were better games on, but that more than likely happens every week.  If another bar at another city were to pull that stunt the fans would probably burn it down.  I think it is a disgrace that the very bar that sits less than 200 yards from the team that more than likely supports its revenue for the fiscal year(because lets face it, no one goes in that bar unless its football season) cant show a little respect by at least airing the game.  I can't support an establishment that doesn't care about supporting the community its in.  I will be passing this along to everyone I know, and I am positive the other 15 people that where with me have done the same.    -A local Charlotte Sports Fan"}
{"text":"Went to check out a game with some friends and was horrified at our service.  One of our party received a cold pizza roll and brought it to our server's attention.   How tacky can one be in deciding to stick one's finger in a patron's food and declare the patron wrong?  Unbelievable.   And then the manager decided to get in on the action. He made a special trip to our table to declare the server was correct in her statement and her action because she was requested to stick her finger in the food in question.  Really?  If this is any indication of how customers are treated at Picasso's, rest assured that members of my party took note and WILL spread the word.  My first and last visit.   Thank you for a great football Sunday."}
{"text":"Stick with the pizza and wings. Though I haven't had either, I did order a buffalo chicken sandwich last night that was missing all the requirements of a buffalo chicken sandwich. The chicken breast was grilled and a dab of buffalo sauce was added to the bun as if it were ketchup on a burger. As a grilled chicken sandwich it was ok, but not what I was expecting for a buffalo chicken sandwich. Every time a serve passed with someone else's order of buffalo wings I felt a bit cheated."}
{"text":"My favorite sports bar in Charlotte! So hard to find good wings the way I like them. Very crispy and so damn good!  Pizza is good too! Try the Masterpiece!"}
{"text":"Had the wings. I was underwhelmed. Service was friendly. Trivia nights on Tuesdays - music / microphone too loud."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings I have ever had in my life come from here. They are always great, good size and the flavors they offer make them good as well. A win win situation. The servers are always friendly, cute and know what they are doing. They have a wide range of televisions and games so there is never a dull moment inside.    The location is great, not being in the direct center city makes it not too crazy which is what I like. Unless you find a great parking spot, be prepared to have a nice walk, especially after a few drinks."}
{"text":"Home of the Huskers... of course I am a big fan :)  But in all seriousness, Picasso's has some of the best food when it comes to sports bars. The wings are just fantastic. They also have killer pizza rolls that come in a whole mess of flavors. Anything from your standard pepperoni to Philly cheesesteak. I have had each variety and they are all equally delicious. They also have great drink specials throughout the week.  Picasso's is just a short walk from Bank of America Stadium. It's a great place for pre and post game drinks and eats. It's not the fanciest place by any means, but the atmosphere is always fun and full of excitement.  There are some great people that work here. I have been coming here for years to watch Nebraska games. They always take such good care of us. All super nice. I have never had a bad experience when it comes to the staff.  A new bonus for this location is the Romare Bearden Park that just opened across the street. It's absolutely gorgeous. The new Knights stadium will also open near here in the Spring.   Make sure that you pay the box if you park in the lot next to the building, or any of the lots around if for that matter. The parking peeps will boot and tow."}
{"text":"I have this place on my Top 3 list for wings. They are the perfect standard wing if your looking for consistency they win all the time. I haven't been in a while but I'm sure when I do they will be spot on as usual. Always a great bartender at this place as well."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere and great food. What more could you ask for on a weeknight in Uptown? The crowd here is laid back and unpretentious, and the servers here are friendly and welcoming. The menu offers a great selection, from traditional items like wings and wraps, and even pizza. Dare I say it: this may be the best pizza I've had in Charlotte so far! Level with me here - it's not phenomenal, and it's no NY slice, but it's pretty good for Charlotte! I had the spinach and sun dried tomato small pie. It's not crispy, but it's doughy and yummy - I'll take it. We also had the honey chipolte wings which were spicy and delicious. Only minor issue here was that our server, who was the bartender, kept forgetting to put our wings in and it took us forever to get them. But he was so cool and funny that we didn't really care much, and it actually became funny after a while even though we were starving.   Picasso's is large in size and as I mentioned, draws a great crowd. We were here on a Tuesday night and it was packed. There is a big leather couch right in the middle of it to lounge on and you are surrounded by TV's no matter where you sit. Head on over for some great food and relaxation!"}
{"text":"This establishment does not accept tourists. We were denied access very abruptly by the doorman on a Tuesday at like 11:45pm ffs. I have an id which clearly indicates I am (way) older than 21, and so did my friend, but NOPE! Sorry, doorman too dumb to read my friend's foreign id so lets not have them spend money here. Ridiculous. And we just wanted to eat and get out. Appalling to say the least."}
{"text":"I love the Caribbean Creepers wings. They are delicious. I've never dine-in but it looks like a nice place to hang out. I always get my wings to-go. They are always ready when I get there."}
{"text":"Well hello friends!!  I've been here a few times before. So, now I'll write a review.  Well today \"Grumbles\" (my stomach) wanted something different than the norm on this bright sunshiny day! After going back and forth with Grumbles I gave in and was just along for the ride. In comes PICASSO'S.   I used to go to the East Blvd location all the time and loved the Pepperoni Rolls - so we (me and Grumbles) placed a carry out order of:   Pepperoni Rolls $6.99 (see pix) Honey Chipolte - $8.25 (see pix)  We really enjoyed everything but noticed the pepperoni rolls seemed to be lacking in the pepperoni department- how ironic!!. The other location used to STUFF em w/ Pepperoni, this location looks as if they laid 11 pepperoni in line, placed some cheese on it, rolled it and baked it.   Maybe it was a bad day, then again....MAYBE NOT!. I wont let that stop me from going back again. The wings were pretty good. Thanks for the wing recommendation (Clint L.).  Cheers"}
{"text":"Do not get the philly. The sand which is only beef and American cheese. The menu may say onions and peppers. Nope."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here specifically so I can't rate the service but my boss orders from here all the time and both the pizza and wings were really good. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Ugly décor, bad food, poor service."}
{"text":"Like Steve said: \"Home of the Charlotte 49ers and they have beer.  That is all you need.\" Also, some of the best wings in the city, and the carnivore pizza is amazing, especially if you don't care about calories :)"}
{"text":"I went to Picasso's Uptown all the time for their buffalo chicken roll and lemon pepper wings! So when they closed I was sad I knew there was one in University so I decided to give it try and it was AWESOME! The service was great and the food was great I sure did miss those lemon pepper wings!"}
{"text":"Came here on a random Wednesday night, after spending way to much money at Ikea. I had a strange hankering for wings, and yelped this place...  I walked in, and was greeted kindly and seated quickly. Long story short, I got a dozen wings and fries. The wings I got (Honey chipotle) were above average, but not fantastic. The fries were also above average as well...  Long story short, a little bit overpriced, and average flavors. At least the service was good!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, our server as well as several of the other staff checked on us several times. Food came out in a timely manner. Had the creeper wings"}
{"text":"Good food, good late night, full of Philly Phans!!  What a great place to find  tucked away in the city.  Naturally, I ordered the Philly sub to give it the ol' test.  It passed!  The key is the roll and their roll was nice and fresh.  If you are full of food/beer and want something else to do.. Stroll over to the shuffle board table and give it a spin while you watch the games.  They even have friendly poker games once a week that you can simply just show up and play.  The whole staff is friendly and dont mind striking up a conversation with you.  The only negative side is that the place just isnt that clean.  But if you dont expect the Ritz ahead of time and know just where you are going.  Then you should be fine.  Enjoy!  -Ian M."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here before a concert. The service was great, the food was delicious, and the drinks and drink specials were good too. They had $5 house liquors and $2 natty bottles. Tons of TVs so I imagine it would be great for watching a game. I had a pizza that was to die for. The people are so friendly and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went to Picasso's around midnight on friday after arriving in town. It was a long drive so I went to have a few drinks  and grab some takeout for a late dinner. As I arrived, the security guard reached out and I raised my hands because I thought they were going to frisk me before entering. It turned out that he was just a friendly guy and was shaking my hand as I walked in.   I go on and have a couple of drinks while waiting for my takeout order. The bartenders were attentive and quick which I enjjoyed after being on the road all evening. My order arrived, I settled the bill and went back to my hotel. When I got back and started munching on my delicious wings, I realized I left my phone. Now I'm in panic mode. I had my wife try calling them while I took off back to the bar.   As I'm walking in the door, the bartender holds my phone in the air to my relief. Hell, since I'm already there I may as well have another drink and a beer. The bartenders (Mike and Ken i think) were terrific. They told me that they actually tried to track me down in the parking lot when I left the first time but I was already gone.  Friendly security guard, great bartenders and good food. That's a winning combination. Also, plenty of tv's for sport lovers and they were having karaoke night while I there."}
{"text":"They have some great wings here (ask them to make them extra crispy). I literally have tried most of their flavors, except for the insanely hot ones. This time I tried the Pineapple Kicker Wings. I was thinking they would be a little more sweeter with the name \"Pineapple\" and all, instead they are more on the spicer side. The bf had Hot Garlic. They too were on the spicer side instead of really tasting the garlic. All in all the wings were still good and now you can get a basket which comes with six wings and a nice size helping of French Fries for $7.99. Before you would have had to add a side of fries. They also have really good drink specials: $2.50 draft beers and $9.00 pitchers. The appetizers of my choice is the Spinach Artichoke Dip and the Pepperoni Pizza Rolls...I wouldn't recommend the  Fried Jalapeño  b/c when I had them they were kinda mushy and I actually prefer them with cream cheese instead of a nacho cheese filling. Looking for a place with great wings and specials on drinks then head over here...also a great place for sport fan fanatics!"}
{"text":"Decent beer options and the buffalo chicken roll was very tasty! We went on a slow day to try somewhere new and would probably go often if it were walking distance."}
{"text":"Had the calzone Saturday. REALLY good. As usual, great service, friendly people, plenty of sports. A great spot."}
{"text":"Excellent food and trivia. Perfect after hours spot for us tourists staying at the nearby  hotels, Hilton, Marriott and Holiday Inn. Near Boardwalk but more of a locals spot.   Oh and they have poker tables for hold em if that's your thing. Friendly staff cheap drinks trivia large TV's at the bar. It was inviting from the time we walked in the door."}
{"text":"Great bartenders, good food, and great atmosphere. The pepperoni rolls are a must try! Good place to watch a game, lots of tv's and they'll always have your game on!"}
{"text":"Great place to come have a beer and watch the local 49ers play on their big screens.  Ordered the pepperoni rolls and they were fantastic.  Bartender was quick to come take our order and attentive.  Love the soft couches.  The only improvement needed is the bathrooms!"}
{"text":"I a bit confused with the rating here... I can see why it got some good reviews as well.  It's super convenient to downtown but I found it a little lacking.    Let me preface that it was a Thursday... and I wanted to grab lunch with a friend at an \"off peak\" lunch time... towards 1pm.  We walked in and we were told we could sit wherever we wanted, the place wasn't really that busy.  Couple people playing pool and some (maybe 3) other tables had some people sitting down.  Server was friendly but very rushed... must have been either recovering from the lunch rush or just multi-tasking, but he definitely did his job in getting our order in.  Not sure why it took very long for our sandwiches to come out of the kitchen... maybe short staffed that day?  or something else, but I wasn't too thrilled with the quality of my sandwich and fries.  Not that the food was in-edible, but just a little sloppy.  Not something I would have expected for the price they were asking for.  I may try them again, but I wasn't too thrilled during lunch.  Maybe their speciality is during games and evening...."}
{"text":"Stopped in to catch some Monday Night Football action here after a nice dinner.  Cowboys versus the Giants... man the crowd was insane.  Since the place was busy our waitress was running around like crazy... but didn't seem like she was doing anything.  It took forever for her to get the bill after my buddy and I each had a beer.  Luckily we both had cash on us so we just left it on the table.  Service aside, we didn't eat any food so I may come back here to try that out - maybe not on a football night.  There are plenty of screens and TVs all around the Bar and dining area so everyone had a decent view of the screens - I could see it as a fun place to go and watch games.  I think my friends and I just wanted to check in on the score, but didn't think the bar was going to be so charged up.  There were some die-hard Giants and Cowboys fans in there.  We left during the half since it felt like a fight was going to break out at any second.  I'm pretty sure nothing happened, but it was a lot of people yelling at each other - maybe we got there late that we didn't realize all those people were friends and were just making fun of each other..."}
{"text":"Recently went here with my boyfriend. We couldn't decide whether to get pizza or wings, so we got both! Ordered a medium house pizza and 12 wings (6 BBQ Pineapple Kicker & 6 Honey Chipotle). Both were delicious! The pizza crust and sauce were clearly house made and perfectly cooked (I like my pizza a little doughy so if you prefer yours a little crispier you might want to request this). The wings were also exactly what I wanted: crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The honey chipotle was both of our favorites, the bbq pineapple kicker was just ok (still polished all of them off though).   In terms of ambiance it is most definitely a sports bar, so if you're not into being surrounded by TVs and beer then I probably wouldn't recommend this place for you. Service was good, although I would imagine on game days it might be a little more hectic.  All in all it was exactly what we were looking for. We will definitely be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"As a visitor from Maine, Picasso's really shouldn't stand out enough to warrant a yelp review. It's caters to Nebraska football fans, which makes absolutely no sense considering my Maine house is 300 miles closer than the football stadium. The decorations are kitschy. The beer list is ok. Prices are normal but not exceptionally cheap or expensive. In most ways it's just like any other average sports bar in America. So why 5 stars?  First, the food. Specifically the wings. Best I've ever had. Extra crispy, with hot sauce (far better than the \"hotter\" Lucifer's Own) is about as good as it gets for wings. Anywhere. The pizza rolls, which I believe all three dozen red-clad Nebraska fans ordered, were nearly as delicious. The service was impeccable. Flawless. And overall the place just has a kind of energy. It's an example of the parts not equaling the sum.  I'll be back in Charlotte in spring and will insist on coming here. If they can ship terrible frozen pizza to Picasso's from Lincoln to appease those Nebraska fans, can they please ship some wings to the deprived northeast?"}
{"text":"If your a Charlotte 49'er fan, this is the place to be.  They have lot's of Charlotte memorabilia. The staff is friendly, professional and knowledgable.  We went for a Saturday afternoon lunch.  The sweet tea is VERY sweet, asked for half a glass of ice water.  I had the Southwest Chicken Salad, others had the Manhattan Pizza. My salad was fresh and flavorful. The personal pizza was excellent as well.  They also have NTN trivia if you like playing on-line.  This place probably rocks during hoops season and should be a destination once the 49'ers start their football season.  They have a hugh projection screen TV and all the requisite HD Plasamas"}
