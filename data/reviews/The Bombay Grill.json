{"text":"I went there a week ago and had a terrible experience. The waitress came and asked us if we were ready to order right away we said to come back in a min and instead she took fifteen minutes to come back. Then after we ordered our food we had to wait over half an hour for it. We ordered the butter chicken it was really sweet (I've never had butter chicken that tasted this sweet), they asked if we wanted the food spicy which it was not either. Then when we wanted to order something else it took the waitress a while to put in the order. I was very disappointed with the service and food after reading these reviews on the place. The location on Markham I wouldn't go back to!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is at a new location at 5694 Highway 7. They won't get many points for decor but once you get past the looks there is much to like. Great naan, excellent tandoori, very good aloo gholbi and they will make the spice to suit your palate. Service is fine though timid and soft spoken. The food is always steaming hot and cooked fast. A nicer space would easily earn 4 stars."}
{"text":"My son and I placed a take-out order at the Markham location according to their website menu.  There are no price info on their online menu but that's our least concern anyways.  On their website, some items clearly indicate \"served with your choice of rice or plain nan\".  However, at the time of pick up, the cashier charged us $2.99 for the plain rice.  I disputed the charge based on the info from their website.  However, the immediate response from the young girl (whom I believe is the niece of the owner) was telling me that I must be on the wrong website.  After I confirmed the website address, she then said their website info is not updated and that they'd go by the menu at their restaurant (which states not $2.99 but $1.24 for rice if order with the  dish).   The owner finally came out and he tried to explain to me that they have multiple locations with different prices.  Come on, I don't even care how much you charge me for each dishes in the first place but you should at least stick to what your menu offers.  If it says it comes with the rice, then you shouldn't charge me for the rice.  If your website info is not updated, please figure it out with your franchiser and your web administrator.  If your website is for reference purpose only, please indicate so by banner.  I am your customer and I am not responsible to update your website!  After spending 10-15 minutes on the $3 overcharge, I did get the refund. The food isn't bad at all but the attitude of the young girl irritates me the most."}
{"text":"I prefer this restaurant to really any other Indo/Pak place in GTA.  Of course, Gerrard has Lahore Tikka and there are some higher end restaurants....but overall this homely place has amazing high quality food with solid service.  Butter chicken (kid friendly, not spicey but still great!), Rogan Josh, and Palak Paneer and Dal Tarka are all good.  They have a lucnh buffet which is worth it, but if you order off the menu and get medium spice you are going to be very surprised at the quality.  I catered with them for 30 people and was very happy.  UPDATE: I heard this restaurant has been sold in the past few months.  I have not been since the sale."}
{"text":"Easily for me the top five Indian restaurant I have been to in the GTA. Everything tastes delicious here and the spices are perfectly balanced in all the dishes. Loved the aloo gobi in particular, but the curries and tandoori dishes were also excellent."}
{"text":"Horrible service  The staff here has spoiled our mothers day celebrations. Did reserve a place before hand and had to wait for food for almost 1hr 45 min."}
{"text":"Dinner at The Bombay Grill was mediocre at best.  It took 45 mins for our appetizers to come out, and there was only one other table seated. Not impressed.  While the Hariyali Chicken app was yummy, the Lamb Seekh Kebab was dry. So dry, that it was literally crumbling away with the slight touch of a fork.  The Chicken Biryani is not a Biryani per se, but plain white rice mixed with curry. It had a sweet flavour to it which is not typical. They should really rename their offering, as it is unfair to the definition of what Biryani is. It's fair to say that this was the least enjoyed dish at the table.  The Lamb Karahi faired slightly better. Some pieces of lamb were a little more tender than others, but the sauce was pretty balanced in flavour.  The thing that killed me was the Naan. I am a fiend for Naan, and this was abysmal. As I tore into it, I noticed that the Naan was not chewy and more \"Wonder Bread\" like. The dough for Naan is supposed to be elastic in nature lending a a springy chewy texture to the final product. That was totally missing here. Man, so sad to have wasted my carb allotment on it tonight :(  Still on the hunt for good North Indian food in Toronto. This unfortunately does not qualify."}
{"text":"Good Indian food in Markham area. Had a major takeout from this restaurant recently and food turned out pretty good!"}
{"text":"Came here when opened many years back. Not sure if it is still an all you can eat. I've been meaning to return but haven't found the right foodie partner to join me for some Indian. My memory of this restaurant was a very busy yet enthusiastic owner who was happy to serve around their grand opening. I called in and asked if they have palak paneer? He answered no, asked if I'd be coming today? I said and I would be there soon, he replied then I will specially start making palak paneer for you my friend. And sure enough he did. Excellent food and price when I went. Hoping to return soon."}
{"text":"Agree with the previous reviewer. This is a hidden gem. The decor is mixed but the food is excellent. I have the lunch buffet, which has butter chicken, tandori chicken, goat curry, lentil, cheese and peas, gulab jamum (my fav. indian dessert). They even have hakka chow-mein.  I will definitely come back to try their regular dishes, like fish masala, butter shrimp. I cannot think of another place where they serve Indian buffet in Markham Unionville area."}
{"text":"The soup and nan was great... main course was all right!   The waitress was very polite! Will go again!"}
{"text":"Don't let looks deceive you. I came here on a Saturday night and surprisingly it was pretty empty. The service is great, and food is a 9/10 for an Indian restaurant. The naan was well cooked and biryani had excellent spices. I would definitely come here more than once and would recommend to others looking for some Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the city of Markham. The food here is great, the ambience and the service I have to admit is not the best, but the wait for the food is worth it! Prices are on the higher side being an Indian restaurant, but once again the food is delicious"}
{"text":"We've eaten at many different indian cuisine restaurant. Everytime we go anywhere we try to test out a different restaurant, but none of them are ever as good as the bombay grill. Their naan is always better than anywhere else and more authentic. The dishes we get there are always more flavourful than any other place we've tried. This is by far our favourite restaurant for indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my boyfriend's birthday, he loves indian food so I googled to see which restaurant is the best. I found this one with great reviews, so I ordered the food for delivery. They taste great, but it gave us food poisoning!!! My boyfriend was up all night throwing up, and I had diahhrea. This is such a bad experience!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't know about this place. We were suppose to go somewhere else for dinner but since that was closed we thought of trying this place. The place wasn't pleasing from outside because it was dark and not that great.   We ordered for starters Chicken Tikka and Sheesh Kabab Lamb, my favourite was the Lamb Kabab, it had nice flavour and taste to it, if I come to this place again then it would be for the lamb kabab. We also had Alu Paratha and I have to say they were good but way tooooo spicy for me, well that didn't stop me from not having those paratha, later I had 2 glasses of milk.   For Main dish we had Rangjosh chicken, Butter chicken and Chicken Biryani. The quantity was decent enough for four people. Biryani wasn't that great, adding the rangjosh made me enjoy the biryani.   Overall it wasn't a bad place.  Decor: 2.0 Food: 3.5 Service: 4.5"}
{"text":"The interior could be better. I felt like I was in my grandma's gloomy living room when the lights got switched on at night. But who cares about that when the food is good?   It's just a bit out of my price range, but this is coming from a student.   The food seems to be made with high quality. I enjoyed the chicken korma, tandoori chicken and a dal dish. Naan was good but the goat biryani could use much more spiciness.  Everything I've had were nice and it was a pleasant experience. My wallet says otherwise."}
{"text":"This place didn't stick out at all the one time I went there. I was just doing reviews of nearby places and decided to check out what people were saying. It has a ton of good reviews, so I guess I might have just ordered the wrong thing. Guess I have to give it another try. I will at least say it's the best indian food in markham (not south asian though, that goes to babu or one of the hakka places)."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch buffet and it was really good for what you pay for :) not busy at all when I went. Best Indian so far in Markham!"}
{"text":"Bombay Grill is located along Hwy 7, past McCowan towards Markham. It's located in a plaza that also has the service Ontario office.    Pros:  Decent Food,  Very good Mango Lassi, Faluda, Kulfi and decent prices. They have this great deal for meal for 4 people or something, you get lots of options to choose your dishes. Perfect for families. Decent naan (not chewy)  Cons:  The decor is OLD as HECK... it's not rock bottom prices on the menu to get this kinda 90s decor. I grew up in a South Asian household and frequented Indian restaurants since I was a child. Walking in here takes me back to the 1990s... and it's 2015 for crying out loud.   The owner seems friendly and wonderful. But the times i've been there occasionally you get some staff lacks basic knowledge about menu items and sometimes pricing.   But that's okay!   Would I come here again? Yes. But I would appreciate a change in decor!"}
{"text":"Like others have said, this restaurant is a bit of a hidden gem in an unassuming plaza. We had been to the former location, which was on Main Street Markham in a plaza that has since been torn down for condos, but we like this location better, even if it's nothing to write home about atmosphere wise.  I had beef vindaloo, which was nice and spicy, along with garlic naan, which had a great flavour, and my wife had the paneer. I enjoyed all the dishes, and would recommend this restaurant as a solid Indian alternative if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food I have eaten in a long time   Atmosphere is very relaxed and friendly  Naan bread was freshly brought to the table and  buttered.  Selection was fantastic. Food was fresh and meats were not cheap cuts either. Sauces were rich and filling . I definitely over ate. Fish pakoras were delicious as was butter chicken   There are items for kids or people who don't love Indian food : pasta salad, ceaser salad, spring rolls and friend chicken ect  Didn't try the desserts but they looked good   Lots of fresh fruit as well  I will come back next time we are back in this area again !"}
{"text":"Very good service, I love the food! Reminds me food from India! The receptionist was very nice, he gave us one dish for tryout!"}
{"text":"It was the \"Bomb\"! - 4.5/5  For several month now, my boyfriend has been craving Indian food and I finally gave in. We came here for one of our monthly celebrations and it did not disappoint. This little gem is found all the way in Markham at Hwy 7 and Galsworthy Dr. I made a reservation for 2 around 7pm and when we showed up, it was just us two (it was sooo romantic =3) but then 10 mins later, a family showed up for dinner, haha!   Presentation: The place had a light scent although when we left, that scent was still lingering with us, very clean, there was some Indian music playing in the background at a low volume and it was a very homely setting/ the utensils and plates were clean and all the food brought to us were served in stainless steel dishes.  Pros: big portions (you will have leftovers) and everything is FRESH!  Cons: Their website is faulty if you want to make a reservation, calling them is more efficient.  Fave Eats: Palak Paneer; the cheese pieces were humungo, Butter Chicken; so rich and creamy with a touch of sweetness and lastly dessert, Kulfi; traditional Indian ice-cream, it was heavenly!  Price: Decent, you get a lot of food for three dishes!  Seconds: YES PLEASE! =D"}
{"text":"Good food! So far closest to flavours from back home, moderate spice levels which was a bonus for my daughter. Will go back."}
{"text":"I came here past Saturday for dinner with my family at 5:45pm.  There was one other table seated inside and the restaurant was empty.  After being seated, there were two others that came in to pick up their take out orders.   We ordered at 5:55pm and our food didn't come until 7:05pm and I kid you not.  During our time waiting we noted they had numerous take out orders, catering orders.  But this was not excusable to have your dine-in patrons to wait over 1 hour for even a single dish to come out.    We kept asking her when the food was going to come out, 5 minutes became 30 mins and 3 more minutes became another 30 minutes.  My husband was furious and said we were leaving and then the wife said they already made the food and it's coming out in 3 minutes, it finally did.   This was such a waste of our time to have waited 1 hour just to get the food.  Totally unacceptable and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Omg such a random good find in markham. My boyfriend and I were thinking of what to eat and we decided randomly on Indian. So we did a quick search for Indian food in the area and we settled on Bombay Grill because it was close to where we were.   It's located in the plaza next to the Nofrill on Markham Road and Hwy. In the same plaza as the dollarama. Im surprised I've never been in here before since I've lived in Markham for 10+ years now but I guess I always stuck with Chinese food because I knew what to order.   Anyways we went in and they were serving their lunch buffet. This place is a no frills kind of restaurant. We walked in and it wasn't too busy but there were at least 5 other tables. The waitress told us to sit wherever we wanted. There was no menu or direction so we kinda got up to start getting our food. The selection was not huge. Let's be frank it was like one section at mandarin tiny but it had the goods. They had a bunch of stuff I've never tried before so I grabbed a bit of everything. Everything was super tasty like soooo good. In the middle of our first plate they also brought out naan bread complimentary. THIS NAAN BREAD WAS TO DIE FOR. I would come back to get this naan bread for takeout like lordy.  My favourite thing from their buffet was the goat curry hands down. Nothing was overly salty which was great but it all had awesome flavours. They kept giving bread too.   Then it came to the bill. We walked in not knowing the price or even seeing a menu lol so unlike us. But when my boyfriend saw the bill he was like WOW! Each person after tax and tip was only $15. For a BUFFET on the WEEKEND that's crazy cheap.  I will definetely come here again for lunch even takeout. That naan bread though."}
{"text":"Hands down the best chicken biryani i have ever had. It's moist and flavourful because their are pockets of curry gravey. Tell them you want it spicey, and be sure to use the raita. Raita is a thin yogurt condiment sauce and it is a must/ compliment when having biryani. This place is #1 on my takeout list for closeby Indian food. I also dinned in here once and was pleased with the service. It's definitely not the fine dining type of atmosphere, but I could care less because  I'm all about the food. After all, people be marved after a good session. :)"}
{"text":"Summary: plain looking storefront belies a nice interior that offers great value on buffet lunches, although variety is lacking and the quality is average; the opposite is true of their a la carte dinner (high quality, better variety)!  Top Must-Get: butter chicken Top Regret: tandoori chicken  Tucked in the corner of \"the Dollarama plaza\" right beside Service Ontario, the Bombay Grill is easy to miss: the restaurant header/banner looks amateurishly presented, and the menu pasted on the glass is wrinkled and stained.   However, when you walk in, it's actually quite nice: relatively spacious, deep crimson table clothes lined up on white ones, matching the dark red carpet make it a classy look.  And then there's the food:  Dinner a la carte is deceptively filling - portion sizes don't look huge, but because Indian food is \"heavy\", you get full quicky. (The buffet style lunches are obviously filling too). The butter chicken and aloo gobhi were both very tasty and filling!  But to be honest, the value is in the lunches.  $10.99 for a lunch buffet... HELLO! My appetite gets super excited when you can grab a buffet for $15 or less, and this fits the bill.  Is the selection amazing? No. In fact, there's just butter chicken, goat curry, and tandoori chicken for the meats...  For the vegetarian side, mixed veggies, paneer, chickpeas, papadum, kadhi pakora and basmati rice is up for grabs.  But in terms of bang for your buck to get full, this is more than enough. Naan bread comes every few minutes fresh (so, so good) or by request, and it goes spectacularly well with the butter chicken. The goat curry is split evenly between very deboned pieces and large chunks of bone.  On the other hand, the tandoori chicken is very underwhelming - not much flavour. Service is alright in that they are responsive to your needs, but it's lacking in the check ups (we only had our water refilled once on the buffet lunch... Although to be fair, we were too busy eating to care, and they didn't clear our plates at all).  The fruit bar is also woefully small, with just watermelon and cantaloupe. Nobody touched it... So maybe it's small since it's not the main focus? But a couple more options would've been nice.  The place was empty at 1 pm but slowly got more busy.  All in all, this is a solid place to get full on butter chicken and naan... Snorlax level fullness awaits ya!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite indian restaurant in Markham.  I live nearby and it's my go-to for indian takeout.  The bad part about this place is that the inside is really old and ugly.  Zero ambiance.  The service is a bit weird - inconsistent, I suppose is the best word.  Regardless, the people who work there are at least very nice, so that's redeeming.  The good: the food.  Oh, the food.  Not many indian places serve beef, but beef curry is my absolute favourite, and theirs is on point.  My other favourite dish from this place is the eggplant (baigan burtha).  Best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying i have been coming to this place since it opened...the food is always good. However- on this occasion the service was BEYOND DESPICABLE! i had ordered 3 mains, each comes with your choice of rice, or naan.  i arrived, paid my bill; then realized it was abnormally high. i looked at my bill to see that i was charged extra for the rice and each naan, and had 3 additional naan included at a charge of $0- not what i ordered.  No big deal; went inside, pointed out the error; to which the young girl behind the counter LAUGHS at me and says \"no sorry sir not at this location\".  The menu states it, the website states it; THE WRONG SIDES WERE INCLUDED- THEY GOT THE ORDER WRONG, and REFUSED to offer up a refund.  Apparently this is the customers fault.  HORRIBLE SERVICE. RUDE. OBNOXIOUS BEHAVIOUR.  i happen to know the owners and will be returning during the week to give him a piece of my mind."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review about this restaurant for some time now. This place is situated at the corner and is a little hard to find. When i went last week, it was empty and me and my friend ordered Chicken tikka masala along with naan, lassi. The food takes a LONG time to arrive. I dont know whow they work at the back but i figured everything was being made fresh, so i stayed patient.  Once the food arrived, the pakoras were okay . I didnt really like them too much. The lassi was your standard fare and tasted good. The tikka masala was very good and made the wait worthwhile. The naan was also fresh and soft and for the two of us, the total meal was filling. It is a little on the pricey side but it was worth it.   They need to get better with the efficiency, other then that, i will return"}
{"text":"100 times better than the East Side Mario's down the street!  The sizzling chicken plate was moist and juicy. The butter chicken was smooth, flavourful and ... well, buttery. The naan bread, warm and soft with a crispy skin. The rice, fluffy and delicious. In fact the entire mean was delicious ... and the waitress was attentive, pleasant and very helpful.   Don't mind the decor with the aging carpet, drop ceiling and homey charm. It's actually charming in a down to earth and honest kind of way. Dump the chain restaurants owned by billionaires, support the local economy and come eat here instead."}
{"text":"This indian restaurant is by far the best in markham!  The food is always fresh and is cooked for perfection love the beef karahi and the butter chicken. ... I now go here very often because its very delicious!"}
{"text":"Relied on ratings to find this place and you guys didn't let me down!  Not a fancy establishment but the food was very tasty. We had shrimp Korma, chicken korma, and chicken karahi. We got rice with each and had enough left over for another dinner. Would recommend 2 orders of rice for 3 people. The nan was plentiful and delicious.  The food and nan stayed warm the whole meal. This place is a jem waiting to be discovered by your pallet.  A must try if you are in reasonable driving distance!"}
{"text":"The Bombay Grill was a spicy adventure I undertook per positive Yelp reviews.  The second we walked in, I knew we were in an authentic Indian restaurant - we were the only non-Indian table in the restaurant.  We ordered an Indian Chai and a Mango lassi.  Both were rich and tasty.  The entrees were beef curry and chicken masala, both came with naan.  The plain naan had a layer of crisp on the outside and was soft and warm inside.  It mixed well with the spicy curry and masala, both were creamy, rich, and complex with variety of spices.  The chicken and beef meats were cooked to tender, and both were marinated so well that I could taste a hint of the sauces inside the meat.  I am not an expert in Indian food.  I can attest that the food was rich, creamy, tasty and spicy.  The sauce is thicker than that at Amaya Express Indian Food at food courts.   We requested medium hotness for both entrees, and for fellow non-Indians, this is the same hotness of \"HOT\" at St Louis Wings and Ribs.  The store is hard to find, and the store front is nothing to write home about.  The interior decor is okay enough - red linen table cloth, freshly painted wall with paintings.  If the owner spends little on wall arts and more on food, I am totally fine with it."}
{"text":"Excellent value for this Indian buffet we tried for the first time this weekend.  $11 for all you can eat buffet 7 days a week!  I really enjoyed this place as it seems less spicy than some other places.  Selection includes tandoori chicken, vegetarian samosa, paneer, butter chicken, chick pea masala, papadum, onion pakora, gulab jamun.  Fresh naan is brought to your table.  I liked how they had watermelon in the fruits section for dessert (rare to find these days during lunch buffet).  This place is quieter than other buffets I've been to probably due to the location, this I like very much.  Lunch buffet prices : Tues-Fri  11:30am to 2:30pm Sat-Sun 12pm to 3pm  Non veg ... $10.99 Vegetarian ... $9.99 Children (2-7 yrs) ... $6.99"}
{"text":"At first glance this place might give a bad impression. The place is small and decor was a bit out of date. Most people were having the all you can eat but I decided to order from the menu instead and I'm so glad I did. Got the garlic naan - man was it garlicy and buttery. I known garlicy is not even a word but there is no other way to describe it. It was simply yummy. The butter shrimp was just as good and had so many flavors. A very good Indian restaurant but I still consider Bombay Bhel the best in terms of taste and quality. Business didn't seem that great but I guess its due to their location. Right in the middle of Markham which is like the new China town now. Hope business picks up as I would hate to lose this place since its so close to home."}
{"text":"I have finally found a place in the GTA that makes a wonderful paneer.  After (4!) long years in search of a good paneer that matched the paneer that I had in (believe it or not), Guelph, I've stumbled upon this jewel.  We came on a Sunday night.    Initially, we had intentions to dine in the place but to be very honest, we were a bit sketched out.  First, there weren't that many people in the restaurant...so I actually had to contemplate for a second if I was going to go in.  Then, when we got in, there was a lack of lighting there and the table clothes were actual cloth...in need of cleaning 10 years ago.  BUT...the place smelled delicious so the bf and I decided to be brave and stick to ordering ...for takeout.    We ordered a chicken korma and a paneer with upgraded garlic naan.  We also ordered a chicken pakora for starter.  The chicken pakora was sub-par actually and had that been the only dish I ordered, I would not have gone back.  The parkora was definitely not freshly fried and tasted re-fried/re-heated.  The portion was also very small for a dish that costed $10.    The chicken korma was quite good and flavourful.  The only complaint I have is that they used a lot of dark meat, making the chicken taste very fatty.  Their garlic naan was definitely worth the upgrade because they used LOTS of fresh garlic.    Their saving grace was the paneer makhani.  OH. My. God.  It was SO delicious.  The tomato sauce was just the right amount of flavour and they were bang on on the texture of the paneer.  This is definitely a place that I will come back to - hands down."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, ambience is not so much. We have been here for lunch and dinner. The flavor and presentation is just delicious."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night with my boyfriend because I was craving Indian food.  We were seated right away and the kind waitress was very attentive throughout the night (partly because we were the only dine ins).  I ordered a mango shake ($4.49) and it was delicious. I expected it to be thick since it was a shake but it was the perfect consistency.  My boyfriend was nice enough to let me order what I want (partly because he didn't know what to order haha). I got the paneer pakora (6 for $9.99), butter chicken ($11.99) and garlic naan ($3.99) to share.  It took a while for the food to come but when it did, everything was done to perfection. The paneer pakora is not something I see often on menus but maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the cuisine so I was very excited to try it. It was the perfect crispiness and the accompanying sweet sauce paired perfectly with it. The portion of the butter chicken was big enough to fill the both of us. Although it's not the best butter chicken I've ever had, it was still good. The garlic naan was very garlicky which I appreciated. I can even taste the garlic with the butter chicken sauce covering it!  Overall, I would say that the service is a bit slow but the food is great. I'm quite interested in coming back to try their lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet. The food quality reflects the price. $10.99 a person for a buffet - you get what you pay for. You can tell the ingredients is not the freshest. Probably wouldn't come back with anyone else, but maybe I'd pop in for a quick lunch by myself."}
{"text":"I love the food here, and have been a frequent customer for well over a year now. Though I agree that the decor definitely needs some upgrading - the great food makes up for it. I've been here well over 30 times, my family and I all love this restaurant. We typically order the butter chicken, shrimp karahi, naan, mango lassi and masala chai. 90% of the time the food comes right away (within 10-15 mins), the longest we've ever had to wait for our order was about 25 mins (rare occurrence). Would definitely recommend - their spicy butter chicken doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great stuff. Their curry is flavourful and goes great with their naan."}
{"text":"Although the owner of this location (Krishna) hasn't put as much work into the interior decorating of this place like the Burlington location, I found the food quality and service to be far superior. He has taken the effort of traveling to Delhi to venture on the streets to replicate flavors to the best that he could and he has done an amazing job!!! Originally from Nepal and in the Markham area for a few years now, his passion and dedication for his restaurant is even indicative in the dishes he serves as part of his lunch buffet which is only $11 includes meat and veg dishes as well as naan that is brought to the table fresh and warm. With a very pleasant demeanor, humble attitude and gratitude shown towards every customer there; excellent food at an extremely reasonable price, he scores high on my Yelp list for the one of the best Indian restaurants in the Scarborough / Markham and beyond area(s)."}
{"text":"This is the latest addition to the Bombay Grill restaurants, this recently opened Indian restaurant is not easy to find. As it is in the back of a building on Main Street, it can easily be missed. However, I'm glad we discovered this gem! This place has a great lunch buffet for an amazing deal - 8.99 for buffet. The selection is small for the buffet, but it has all the classics, which definitely hit the spot.  The best seller at this place is the NANN bread. Its soo good.. Perfectly crispy on the outside, and soft and moist and warm on the inside. It goes great with the butter chicken or chicken tika masala. The server, there's one main guy, is super friendly and will explain or get you anything you need.  This place is a definite must try for those in the Markham area who are craving some fresh, tasty Indian food. MUST try the lunch buffet - really worth it!"}
{"text":"Bad service, super so-so food, waitress was super rude,and didn't wanna talk, would not recommend"}
{"text":"Went based on reviews and we were craving some Indian food.   We ordered a lamb curry and a chickpea curry + samosa.... overall, everything was disgusting.  Overly salty, thick layer of oil on top of the curry.... samosa's were deep fried and ultra oily and the stuffing (we chose vegetarian) was all mashed potatoes.  Will NOT be coming back, only reason this place has 4 out of 5 stars is because people are saying it's $11 bucks for AYCE lunch.   Not for anyone who genuine enjoys good indian food."}
