{"text":"Really good bbq. What they rub their ribs with is awesome. The hot sauce is just that, I usually go with the sweet. Pork shoulder sandwich is very tasty and may require a fork. Fries are the best get the sauce on them. The owner is a hoot by the way. Really good guy doing really good barbecue."}
{"text":"Close to work and they have a great special buy 1 get 1...cant remember what day though.  Yikes!  As far as polish boys go...they are OK.  They have a great snap but the bun is way too soggy.  Also, their sauce is a little too sweet for me.  Tastes like they just Dr. up open pit BBQ sauce.  Good in a pinch I guess  ;)"}
{"text":"I enjoy the Ribs because they're Cooked in an Aquarium Type Smoker can't say I've tryed anything else as long as I've been Patronizing them!"}
{"text":"Their polish boys are okay if you don't feel like driving to your favorite BBQ place to get it. They did not have an AC so dinning in on a hot day is not a good idea."}
