{"text":"When this restaurant first opened I was looking very forward to checking it out. Our first attempt was on Halloween, they advertised on their social media that they would be open and when we went at 9pm the doors were locked. Several months later we decided to give it another go. We took a spot at the bar and had to wait over ten minutes just to be given menus. When we finally were able to order, the cocktails were quite nice, we each tried two and they were all tasty and looked as lovely as they look on their social media photos. Where we were disappointed this time around was that nearly an hour after ordering an appetizer (pork belly toast) we were told that they forgot to put our order in. They weren't apologetic when we advised we needed to cancel as we had somewhere to be and we aren't likely to go back as the service experience overall was not stellar."}
{"text":"My wife and I went on Saturday night to try it out. Overall, this was a great spot and we'll be coming back in the future.   It has a friendly modern feel to the place. Very dim lighting, with chairs and benches close together. Since the food is all family style, that makes sense! Even with the close tables, the restaurant felt very open and welcoming to me.   The service was a little slow, but it was full up when we arrived. I'm sure as it develops, the service will speed up. The waitresses were on top of everything though. They came by every few minutes to top of the drinks.  I was impressed with the food. We ordered the sous vide pork belly and the broccoli fritti. The broccoli fritti was so good, I wouldn't share it next time. It has a good crunch and cheesy flavor without overriding the broccoli. The sous vide pork belly was cooked perfectly through with a sear on the outside to lock in the juicy flavor. It came with a sweet sauce that paired perfectly with pork.   We're looking forward to heading back!"}
{"text":"Happy this place take reservations on OpenTable. We had a table of 4 and ordered a bunch of items to share. We were surprised that that was not that much     dishes with pig/pork on it. The rosemary fried chicken was really good, along with the tuna tartare."}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre food and unoleasant loud live music on Saturday. The place also stunk of cooking fat. Needs a better ventilation system with the kitchen downstairs just smoking into the dining area. Would not come again."}
{"text":"Alright. Not a yelp guy but honestly downloaded this app specifically to have a platform to speak about the outrageously delicious potatoes they fire up here. Server knew what he was doing and was helpful when it came to make decisions on the menu. Beer tap menu is lit fam. This place is a hidden new gem and probably the perfect spot for hungry people looking to snack and pregame before going out on 17th. BOMB."}
{"text":"We decided to try Run Pig Run as it is one of the new and hot spots on 17th ave. It started well, we were easily able to get a spot for two on a Saturday evening. Their cocktail menu was good and cocktails were quite nice. Presentation of the \"smokey b-\" drink (can't remember it's full name) was quite fun - I won't spoil it for those of you wanting to try it. However, the food was a little disappointing. Apparently the menu was recently updated and the restaurant is only a few weeks old. We tried a number of small plates and felt the only really great piece were the pork ribs which had a nice honey glaze on them. The avocado pork belly toast had barely any pork, the poutine was just \"eh\" (no canadian pun intended), and the fried chicken had a really smokey mustard and strange after taste that was not my favourite. The service was a little bit slow, no water refills, seats were very close together, and the vent kept blowing out cold air. Overall, still a new restaurant that needs to hopefully work on spicing up their menu and environment. For cocktails though, they are spot on!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for brunch which wasn't necessary as they weren't busy but we got a nice table in what they call the \"fishbowl\" great natural light and lots of room to spread out. The table is a bit wide though so we felt a little ways away from those on the other side. We all ordered coffee and different items off the brunch menu, I went with the chicken and waffles and it did not disappoint, it was a great balance of sweet and savory, the chicken was crispy and salty, I really liked how it went with the waffle and syrup. The waffle could have been a bit crispier but that's a personal preference. Price point was on par with other Calgary restaurants in the area for brunch."}
{"text":"Yayy finally got to check out this restaurant that I have been creeping on Instagram and drooling over haha   They take reservations and were really accommodating even on a Friday night. The server was super nice and gave us tips on what to get and how much food to order. Its a small plates restaurant with small portion sizes so we ordered a lot of food.   We got mac and cheese, pork ribs, pork belly, spare ribs and beets (we wanted to try and be a little healthy) and the apple cobbler for dessert! Perfect amount of food for 4 people.   The mac and cheese gnocchi was so yummy! Smothered and cheese with bread crumbs on top- one of my favs for sure! You could also add additional pork belly to this dish as a topping and unfortunately I only found that out after ordering but that would be awesome! Highly recommend this dish.   The spareribs was my second favourite - the meat was so soft and perfectly sauced with quinoa and mushrooms added to it. Really great dish. The pork ribs were also really yummy.  The pork belly was deep fried and too fatty for me personally. It could also use a bit more flavour to it. The side of potatoes were perfectly flavoured though.   The apple cobbler - I didn't like much. The apples were sour and I like my dessert to be sweet but that might just be a personal preference since my friends seemed to like it. Also, there was way too little ice cream on top of it! Come on now! More ice cream always.   Overall, good food and service! Would go back for the mac and cheese and the spareribs!"}
{"text":"The place has pretty good food. So we ordered a few dishes to share. We got: Alberta Ribeye 4K Farms Berkshire Pork Chop Fried Chicken  First off its not like a wow place. Nothing that would be an eye opener here. The Alberta Ribeye was good and was cooked perfectly. The pork chop was like ham style. It was a bit too salty. Fried chicken was nice. It had a good flavor to it and was a good dish to share.   Atmosphere was nice. Lights dim and relaxing. Place is quite busy. Good selection of wines.   The place looks like a small house located on 17th avenue. Overall, I would say I would go back."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Run Pig Run since they opened, I've always wondered about the name and how the food would be. I follow them on social media and the pictures of the food look pretty good, but I've read mixed reviews. When I got back from California, I wanted to give this place a try.  Run Pig Run is located right on 17th avenue, right across from National and right beside the Gas station. You can't miss the sign. It was a Sunday afternoon on NYE, around 1pm and only brunch was served (from 11:30am - 2pm). Upon entering, you walk up some stairs and wait to be seated. There were a few tables occupied, d√©cor is rustic yet simple, felt nice and cozy, since it wasn't busy, the girl up front told us to sit anywhere. D and I sat at a half booth half table. We ordered waters and were handed menus. Their brunch menu isn't huge but they have unique brunch items. D and I went with eggs benedict each, they have two options pulled pork and citrus cured salmon so we went with one of each. We were hungry so we also ordered chicken & waffles to share.  Food took a little longer than expected but our server apologized and we were fine with it. First our bennies came out and it looked fabulous. Each order came with a small kale salad as well as triple cooked potatoes and poached eggs sitting on biscuits. We immediately grabbed the potatoes because they looked really crispy and good, and they definitely were!  The pulled pork was really tender! The citrus cured salmon was nice, I could definitely taste the citrus. I also think the biscuits had a citrus flavor as well because I tried D's and I could taste the citrus, it was different but a nice change! The triple cooked potatoes were very good, the chunks were thick, triple cooking them was no mistake! They were soooo good. Kale salad was a nice side as opposed to fruit or something ordinary. The chicken & waffles was good too! The candied bacon on top was rummy. The waffle and chicken could have both been a little more crispy but it was still really tasty. Waffle was fluffy, the drizzle of maple syrup was perfect - it looked like there was some whole Dijon mustard grains sprinkled on top which was different but went well with everything. The chicken was juicy and had a lot of flavor! Everything was great.  Overall, our server was kind and attentive. The food was really good, better than I had read and expected. Being the newer kid of the block, Run Pig Run has a lot of potential! I'm looking forward to trying out their dinner menu which is family style sharing plates!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the atmosphere! It's got a very open feel to it. They have live music, who was great to listen to (Ken Stead).  Their drinks are on point and very well done. The bartender was amazing and friendly.  We also tried the beets and apple cobbler (not together) and they were both so amazing!! Mmmm, I want more actually just thinking of it.  The owner, James, is very friendly and ensures the personal touch is there. He has been in the industry for a very long time and it shows with how well the restaurant is run.   Definitely check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Such a great spot. Solid patio along 17th ave, and the food is really good. The menu changes, so if you haven't been in awhile, it's worth going back. Interesting to note that tonight they didn't have any pork menu items, which is a shift. Well planned and thought out dishes, but a heads up that the portions are large (for example, the warm olives could have been shared by 4 people easily). The cocktails are excellent, and the beer and wine selection is not without. Cool atmosphere, and while I expected the live music on a Saturday night to be overwhelming in the dining area, it was a perfect addition to the dining experience. I hope the people of #yyc continue to support this establishment...it's a great spot."}
{"text":"Food was very average. We tried almost all of the small plates. Tasty enough but it all felt very heavy and unhealthy. The renovations look good and it's a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a Saturday brunch but when we go there and found out it wasn't busy at all. We ordered a pull pork benny and an avocado pork belly toast. Both were really good. The server was friendly! I really liked the look and feel inside the the restaurant and would like to check back next time for dinner."}
