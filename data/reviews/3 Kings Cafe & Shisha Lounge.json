{"text":"Probably the greatest shisha place I've been to. Whether youre catching up on school work or just hanging out with some friends, its great. The staff is great and very welcoming. They make the place very homey. And the customer service is amazing.  You'll never be disappointed in your shisha, and if you don't like it, no problem. They'll make it the way you want. Definitely a place to go to."}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying this place out, I loved it. The shisha is amazing, love the vibe this place has and also the songs they have on are pretty coool!!! 
This shall be my new shisha spot!"}
{"text":"Service is good. They are really nice and the shisha is decently priced at $12. However, the shisha was not good. We got strawberry mint, but couldn't really taste the strawberry. It has a kind of a plastic taste to it to be quite frank. Maybe it was just that mix of flavors :s"}
{"text":"Just a regular shisha place on lawrence. Nothing special really. Theyre seating is off for a lounge where they only have tables and chairs. Decent shisha overall."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! The best Shisha (hookah) lounge in the city!!! 

My shishas are always refreshing and perfect never burnt.. a few times we came in with a big crowd of about 10-12 people, the staff and owners quickly put together a table to fit our large party and pleasantly greeted us to the lounge. I ordered a chocolate banana shake.... IT WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOOD!!!!!! It's part of my order every time I go. I also tried my friends mango shake which was perfect not too sweet and not too watery!!!

Best Shisha mixes to try 

Grape/mint
Apple/guava
orange/pomegranate 
strawberry/banana"}
{"text":"3 Kings is by far my go-to place for Shisha in the city. I personally have to drive for 20 minutes to get there and it's definitely worth it. My friends and I are regulars there and the staff are amazing. Our Shisha comes perfect every time and the flavor lasts for 2-3 on a consistent basis. If you're in the Scarborough area, I definitely recommend going there and also recommend getting a ice hose with it aswell."}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe - open space, the seating isn't crowded, a decent table if you decide to eat/work.

However, their shisha is very average in comparison to Dreams across the street - BUT they are $3 cheaper than Dreams, so this may be a deal breaker on prices. 

Workers are always around and everything is ordered from the table."}
