{"text":"This place is great all beer and mixed drinks are only 2 dollars. Inside the place is huge and every Friday and Saturday they are packed. They play good music and the servers are really fast. Only problem I have and I warn you be careful if you pay with your credit card they make mistakes sometimes and overcharge. The other night my tab was 18 dollars but the next day when I check my bank account there were 2 charges from them. Other than that great place to hang out friendly people."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Service is sub par. Empty glasses all around our table and an overall confusion as to who is waiting on us (if anyone)."}
{"text":"We popped into Two Bucks last night with a party of about 20. The food was good. The beer was cold and the jokes were plenty. They even made the kids feel welcome. Matt and the rest of the staff were great. We will be back."}
{"text":"Wow, what a bad experience!!  We stopped in for lunch on Saturday, February 28.  We ordered the fish sandwich and were assured by the bartender that the Cole slaw did not come on the sandwich.  We even discussed with the bartender that I would eat it as my husband does not eat cole slaw. I ordered the steak flatbread.  In the meantime we ordrred 2 Blue moons and inquered about a bottled beer they had.  The bartender went on to explain that was a grapefruit beer with a bitter after taste and that women loved it.  She personal did not like it and would not recommend it.  Then she offered a pineapple beer in a can.  This was by far the worst beer I ever had, not only did it smell like canned tuna, it tastes like the water from canned tuna.  I mentioned the less than desirable smell and taste to the bartender.  She smelled the can and said \"Oh my gosh, it does!\" and walked away.  Didn't even suggest thag there may be something wrong with the beer.  Finally....food after almost 30 minutes wait,  the fish sandwich was served with cole slaw on it in addition to the mac & cheese we ordered being room temperature!  The bartender then asked \"Do you want me to take it back and have them take it off?\"  We did send the sandwich back only to have the same fish scraped of cole slaw, served on a cold bun and without even tartar sauce.  At this point we asked to have the sandwich taken off our bill.  She did take it off the bill and proceeded to just toss the sandwich away in the bar trash in front of us.    While we were there we observed other patrons having issues: returning tap beer because it was flat, only one set of broken darts due to theft, poor service.  I wrote a review on their Facebook page and this is the response I recieved:  \"Thank you for taking the time to post.  We use constructor reviews in order to improve and attempt please as many people as possible.  Will talk to the kitchen crew, bartender and buy more darts immediately.\""}
{"text":"Sara (bartender / waitress) was excellent - came right over, got our drink order and food came right out * No problems * Mac and cheese is a must get item for an appetizer * Steak flatbread was ok - good flavor but needed a dressing of some sort * Overall, great 1st experience."}
{"text":"This was the scariest/worst experience I've ever had at any bar ever! I came here to watch a cavs finals game - showed up at 8:15. I tried to move a barstool for my friend and was told I wasn't allowed by the bigger, bald bartender because other guests wouldn't have enough space. He proceeded to let his friends move the same  barstool next to me, making me and several  other guests move so his friend could sit down. I asked why that was permitted - since he said it was a space issue for the extra stool to be there. He proceeded by screaming at me and saying I was intruding on his friends who were sitting next to me at the bar. I didn't say anything back - my fiancé told him we were 'good' and I stopped talking. He continued to scream in my face (I'm a small 5'5'' girl) while I just sat there - silent. He said he didn't owe me an explanation - those were his friends and continued to personally insult me. Probably for 5 - 10 minutes and would not stop. It was so bad that we actually had to leave the bar. Whoever this person is - they should not be working there! I have never been spoken to like this in my entire life - it was honestly terrifying to have a 6' 5'' 45 year old man screaming in your face just because you asked a simple question.   I hope this establishment considers this feedback when evaluating this employee! He is terrible! You should not talk to anyone that way - he seems dangerous."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go here in the early afternoon on the weekend. Grab a few beers that are in your penny-pinching budget and some food, which is always delicious.  *******WARNING********  Do not go here after 10 on a Friday/Saturday if you are not in the mood to deal with trash. It will literally make your skin crawl. But then again, you do have to realize you are in North Olmsted, and we all know what a lovely city it had become (yes, that's sarcasm.)   I am definitely one to get my jollies from people-watching. This is one hell of a place to go to if you do so as well. Otherwise, avoid at all cost. Seriously, some of the people you see will make you want to vomit."}
{"text":"We came to Two Bucks last Saturday night for a benefit for a friend of ours. The bar was filled to the brim with guests. The bar staff and wait staff did a great job keeping up with the crowds needs.  They set up a large area for raffle items and were very accommodating with the sound system to help with the announcing of prize winners.  All in all it was a good night out and we really appreciate this bar with a    Way to go with a job well done Two Bucks!"}
{"text":"I love the Mac n Cheese.   They also make a great spicy bloody mary. The veggie burger slider was very dry and crumbly. - I don't recommend it. Service was great.  It was pretty empty on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"We came in to Two Bucks this Saturday evening and everything was AWESOME! It was by far the best service I've ever experienced in a bar. Every single bartender was very attentive and we never waited for a drink even though it was super crowded. All of the food was great, (Mac & cheese, fries), and I have never enjoyed a simple side salad so much! I can't believe I've lived in this area my whole life and have never been before. I will definitely be back with friends but maybe on a night when the music isn't so loud so us 'older gals' can chat. Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Lousy service and they can hardly live up to their name anymore with their cheapest beers being $2.50 or more and the drafts regular price.  Not even at a discount.  Food has always been good though.  Won't be coming back for a while though.  Clean it up, folks.  And don't try to blame it on the economy or the night of the week."}
{"text":"Great prices if you are trying to booze it up for cheap. Large selection of crafts as well as domestics. Fun specials at friendly prices. Bartender's were also very likeable.  The food is just meh. I wouldn't get the breaded chicken wings again as they come cooked in a batter instead of a breading. Weird."}
{"text":"Ok so the place was empty except for a Paint Nite and 4 guys playing pool. We waited a long time for one of the two bartenders to take our order. The female bartender wasn't very friendly. We actually had to go to the bar to have her come over to take our order. The food took a long time to arrive. However, everything was very, very good!!"}
{"text":"Tuesday evening dinner and drinks with 4-8 people. ( others arrived as others left etc ).     Pros:  Staff is  friendly. Food and drinks are well priced. The food was good, everyone enjoyed their meals.  Good selection of draught beers. TV's everywhere for you sports fans. Pool tables. Large establishment.  Cons: Table service was far below average. I understand servers get busy, but there were only 4 occupied tables in the whole place,  it was pretty dead. We were not attended to nearly enough. Many of the party became frustrated and annoyed when they held empty beer bottles longer then full ones.  At some point we just got up and started going to the bar directly. When the server lady noticed this, she just stopped coming to the table all together. That was the end of  our table service. Some of the party mentioned they  felt like a burden to the server instead of guests. Not the greatest first impression for a restaurant. No dart boards. No free WIFI"}
{"text":"This is a REALLY nice 2 Bucks location. We went in at lunch on Sunday and it was pretty dead, surprisingly. The service was spot on (as it should be being one of the only tables in there) and we got our food in a timely manor.  We got the $2 fried pickle appetizer. It was a great price and a good size! Sometimes appetizers really have too much food and then I don't want my entree. This wasn't the case here, but in a GOOD way.  I had the Buffalo Chicken Wrap. It was really good and a big size, came with fries, which were pretty awesome! My only complaint is the amount of tortilla and lettuce vs. chicken is a bit much. I think splurging on a little bit more chicken would make this much better.  My husband had Pulled Pork Mac n' Cheese. The presentation of this is pretty cool- almost \"gourmet.\" (See photos.) I think it tasted pretty good too, but he wanted more. It makes sense, because I know the cost of macaroni and pulled pork, so the price didn't really seem to match up. Gave me a great idea for cooking at home with guests though!  Overall, a good experience. Wishing they had Coke or Pepsi products, though. Their Cola was not great."}
{"text":"Amazing and inventive takes on classic pub food + great music.  This place won me over from the first visit.  The décor is warm and inviting, the staff are gracious and friendly."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. On my most recent visit, two Bartenders walked right passed and ignored me only to meet at the other end of the bar and start a conversation with each other. I waited a good 10 mins. before I was greeted. Only saving grace is the Mac and Cheese and that is hit and miss. Sometimes it is cold in the center, other times it is delicious. I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The calamari is not the same its a cheaper brand I guess and it's tasteless. They are not serving the Aoli with it anymore and we ordered a Cobb salad which had no hard boiled eggs a smattering of Chicken and a little bunch of bacon bits on it for$ 850 it was very disappointing. The food used to be one of the highlights at Two Bucks but it's clear that they don't care as much about their menu anymore."}
{"text":"I'm so confused how two of the same restaurant could be so different. After the great time and food I had at the Avon 2 Bucks I was excited to realize there was one a mile-ish away from my house. Unfortunately the two places are completely different.   The N.O. 2 Bucks was just plain dirty. The wine glass they served me was completely sticky and the table tops mimicked it. The whole place seemed like it needed a power wash and had a strange smell. The place was huge and awkwardly laid out. It didn't have any of the charm that the Avon one did, and the service was slow and also lacking charm.   The only bright spot, and hence the two stars, was the Mac and cheese. I was glad that it was as delicious as the first time I had it.   The N.O. 2 Bucks could be OK if you had a group of 15, needed a place to go, and were drunk enough to not notice the smell, ambience or sticky glasses.   Other brightside: There's a huge parking lot."}
{"text":"Worst bar ever. Bartenders stand around chatting and when I waved one over finally and said how long we were waiting the manager tells me I should leave. I ignored him since we were w a group and got my drink.  The female bartender did comp me that glass but every drink for everyone was a 5 to 10 minute wait. Guys at bar drinking were also annoyed.  Mind you there were 3 people behind bar and probably 30 people max in the bar.  The owner should restaurant spy his staff for sure!  Manager is a train wreck."}
{"text":"Ehh it was awesome when everything was actually $2.. they should change the name with the rising prices. I mean I can grab a domestic beer anywhere for $2!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan. Drinks were cheap, not good. Cheap means cheap booze, tasted watered down.   The bar had a weird smell, music was loud and really wasn't good.  Seemed like a frat house.   Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I should have trusted the other negative reviews... order a salad, no fork. Ask for ketchup for the fries, no ketchup. I hate places that just don't care. How do they last???"}
{"text":"Food is definitely not their speciality.   The steak salad meat was gray and fatty, it was suppose to have mushrooms on it but there was only 1. The calamari was not cooked thoroughly, the hamburger was rubbery and they forgot ketchup and mustard. Apparently the wings were not too bad however."}
{"text":"Two bucks drinks are not really two bucks anymore but the drinks are reasonable priced. The food is really good and reasonable priced. The bar is a huge and they don't staff enough bartenders for the size of the bar. The wait for drinks is usually pretty long, unless you are a female since most the staff are male. They have plenty of seats for people to sit and they have a DJ on Saturday nights. I would recommend it if you have a large group of people because it is usually a younger crowd."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday at 12:30pm. We were the only ones who had any type of food order in the whole restaurant.   It took 45 mins for two dishes of Mac and cheese to come out and it was cold and one of the dishes looked like it was made days ago. We sent back the dishes and had 1 remade, which took another 25 mins. After I hunted down the waiter to make it a to go order.  It smelled like cigarettes in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great beer menu, good food menu, excellent service.  I saw in other yelp reviews comments about bad service but can say the night i was there that was far from the case. The servers were very pleasant and prompt. My drink was never empty. And nice job carrying DFH 90 min.. My fave! As well as headhunter ipa.the calamari and mac and cheese was great.  Price also good too. I would def return."}
{"text":"Ordered the buffalo chicken sliders. Took a bite and thought \"that's very chewy.\" Looking at the slider, it was raw chicken with a coating on it.  Looked like they microwaved it. After showing it to the bartender, one of 2 drinks was refunded. Maybe not the best refund for potentially inheriting salmonella. But, at least my 6 dollar tab was cut down to $3! Stay away from their kitchen. Enjoy the drinks."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 I would. Worst ever customer experience I have ever had. I have been a customer of this and Avon location several times, and was a fan. No longer!!  Bartender spent his entire time in the corner doing shots with a group of girls, totally ignoring the rest of the customers.   When my girlfriend asked for a replacement for her drink which had taken, he became totally belligerent . When I told him there was no reason to talk to her this way, he threatened \"to jump across the bar and kick my ass\"  I can't believe someone with such outlandish anger issues would be put in a customer service position. This is not some corner hole in the wall bar, but that is the attitude you get  The worst ever, will never go back!!'n"}
{"text":"Love the two bucks!  This location is nice because it has pool tables and is actually really huge!  You can't beat the prices, $2 for most bottled beers and bottom shelf liquor.  My only issue with the north olmstead location is that the staff is not as on top of it as they should be.  My bill is often not correct so make sure you watch out for that."}
{"text":"Formerly known as, Slam Jams, Two Bucks has been a longtime favorite, but not frequented spot of mine. Foods what youd expect from any b-dubbZ or quaker steaks around. Ince the 2X3 dance floor is packed, its over.  This place holds dear to my heart as my Mother and Father met in this establishment. I just may fall in love with one of the many, or a few, beautiful women who frequent this place."}
{"text":"Just had an AMAZING experience. Popped in with a party of 22. The service was great. Matt did not miss a step. Food was great. Definitely will return often. Highly recommend. Friendly atmospher."}
