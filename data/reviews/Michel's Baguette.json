{"text":"READ THIS VERY CAREFULLY.   I'll make this straight to the point:   The food here, generally tastes good and seems of a better quality of what you normally gets from the competitors. However, I feel that this place deserves a 1 stars only because you can't rate them 0 stars. And here below you'll see the reason of my rating.   This is not the first time that I hear colleagues complaining about either being overcharged compared to the advertized price or having the feeling that something was missing or different from the item previously ordered. Today, I had reason to believe that probably my coworkers were telling me the truth.   For three days I bought the same item. For two days I walked away not knowing that I have been served with a sandwich that had different ingredient/s from the one advertised because an employee decided to. It did not taste like expected but because of the look, I couldn't tell exactly what it was. Were the ingredients not so good? Was something simply not added? Hard to tell.   So today I've decided that after I placed the order, I would have \"followed\" my sandwich so that I could see if anything was wrong. The gourmet items SHOULD be served with eggs (scrambled), bacon, BRIE cheese and apple slices. What I discovered is that the BRIE cheese was switched with a cheap, processed slice of cheddar cheddar cheese (not even real cheddar but the processed sliced like the ones Kraft makes).   Now, when I pointed out to the employee, he replied with the usual answer that sounds more like it was an oversight when, really, it wasn't. When the same mistake happens again, like in my case, 3 consecutive days, that CAN NOT be accidental. That has been done on purpose. It's intentional and so, it's fraudulent .   Would you be happy to go and buy a Lamborghini, drive off the dealer and feeling that something is not ok and find out only later on that under the hood you have the engine of a Cobalt? What would you do? How would you feel about it? ............ Exactly, that's what I thought. The logic that applies to the dynamic here, is the same.  I'm sure we all agree that this is wrong to the point that I strongly believe that this business, no matter if the food is decent or not, DOESN'T DESERVE you as a client nor your hard earned money.   SHAME ON YOU!"}
{"text":"Michel's Baguette can be found near the food court at Scarborough Town Centre.   They offer a variety of baked goods, soups, salads, sandwiches and breakfast items. The store is neat, clean and spacious. Plenty of seating is available. Kathleen was friendly and quick.   Decided to try the Chocolate Almond Croissant and Double Chocolate Croissant.  Both were well prepared and fresh. Each croissant was about $2.75.   My cousins enjoyed the croissants as well. We thought the pastry was flaky, buttery and warm. The Chocolate Croissant had a gooey dark chocolate center that was not too sweet. Perfect. The Chocolate Almond Croissant had a smooth almond paste within and a dust of powdered sugar on top. Their serving size is generous and one Chocolate Almond Croissant can definitely be shared by 2.   Loads of delicious goodies at reasonable prices. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Service was really good but unfortunately the baked goods isn't always that fresh and almost never tastes as good as it looks. I'd say it's the price is not worth it's value."}
{"text":"Always liked what I have tried here. The cheese danish for $2.79 is always a good choice. Flaky crust with yummy cheese center. Also tried the bristo spinach $3.29 and the turkey & cheese croissant $3.75. Both were pretty good but liked the croissant better. Haven't tried their coffee before but that can be left for another time."}
{"text":"My review is only based on the loafs of bread and I actually bought a sandwich here once.  They have buy one get one Fridays on all their whole loaf of breads and a baguette. The deal is pretty awesome and it normally gets sold out around 3 pm. My favourite is their egg bread with cheese and cranberry orange loaf. For 5.50 you get two loafs of bread. If you have a coworker split it's perfect. If you're on your own it's okay too. Just keep half of each in your office fridge and its food breakfast for next week!  The baguettes are the best deals. Around $2.50 for 2. They're long and fluffy.   The one time I got a sandwich here was through ritual. Food was not bad also. Fresh and fast pick up. I go here every other friday if I remember."}
{"text":"Had a slice of quiche today that smelt like fish. There was no fish in or near it so I assumed it was really old, threw it in the bin and swore to never return. Had been a couple of times prior and had okay experiences, but I won't be back after this!"}
{"text":"their ham&cheese croissant is amazing and always fresh made!  this place is quite near to my home,  always go there for breakfast"}
{"text":"Stopped in here one morning for an almond croissant and for the price, I expected it to be fresh, but it tasted as though it was a couple of days old. Definitely won't be back here again."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious baked goods! Prices are slightly steeper than a regular cafe but the food is WORTH IT! I'm a die hard fan of the bacon/sausage, egg and cheese croissantwich/bagelwich as well as the spinach and feta croissant. Bagels are incredibly soft- try them toasted with butter, delicious! Top it off with a piping hot cup of Timothy's coffee! I recommend this place to any and every one of my friends!"}
{"text":"After working up at an appetite shopping in Scarborough Town Centre. You follow your nose to that vast array of smells and eateries known as the Food Court. You got that sandwich craving and I know where your headed. No not that longg line-up at Subway, head two stores down and you'll find yourself at the glorious Michel's Baguette Bakery and Cafe, to fill that sandwich void.  Mind you the prices here are a little steeper than your local sub fixing but your getting quality here! Plus is the only option in the food court that has its own private seating and is closed off from the masses flowing through the food court.  Michel's Baguette offers a great selection of freshly baked breads and pastries, French inspired gourmet sandwiches and salads, Soups as well as hot and cold specialty beverages.   Today I came to try a seasonal favourite the Smoked Turkey and Brie with a Side of Sweet Potato Bisque.   I love the sandwiches here, all fresh and quality ingredients. They toast the sandwiches perfectly. You can pick your option of fresh baked baguettes. I chose a whole wheat baguette. The sandwich was perfectly crunchy, cheese melted, I adored the carmelized onions in my sandwich, no flaws here,  The Sweet Potato Bisque deliciously creamy and went perfectly with my toasty sandwich.  Finally for Dessert! They have an excent dessert case with cupcakes, croissants, pasteries, cakes, mini desserts, cookies, and bars. But as soon as saw the Nanaimo Bar I had to have it!  Nanaimo Bar - Is a 3 layer bar with a crumb base of graham, cocoa, coconut, and nuts, followed by a layer of light custard buttercream, and topped with a luscious layer of smooth and glossy semi sweet chocolate.  This was the most decadent and biggest Nanaimo bar I've ever had. Sooo delicious 3 hefty layers of perfection.  And to wash that down I need a large cup of tea. They serve Higgins & Burke Specialty Teas, so I opted for the English Breakast variety. Perfect ending to a lovely lunch.  Definitely come here for the quality sandwiches and great dessert selection. All the girls that work here are really friendly and helpful. It's a must dine in option if your in the STC and want to get out of the crowds and eat on real plates with silverware."}
