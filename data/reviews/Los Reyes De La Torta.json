{"text":"In being a bit of a burrito man, I was suspicious that a torta could ever marvel a tortilla filled with meat.  However, all of the hype on yelp and man vs. food was appropriate, as the torta provided a massive yet tasty introduction to pork, turkey, guacamole, and a bunch of other hidden great tastes all in one sandwich.  The carne asada quesadilla blew us away-- HUGE in portion, amazing meat, and super flavorful.  I was also glad to be one of the few gringos in this place.  People were friendly toward us in any case.  Check out the horchata for some authentic aguas frescas..."}
{"text":"Never have I seen such a variety of meat piled into one sandwich. The Del Rey torta certainly lives up to its name as does this restaurant. Just don't show up expecting to get a giant margarita to go with your giant Torta, they don't serve alcohol here. The only disappointment on an otherwise fantastic eatery."}
{"text":"If you like Chipotle and think Macayo's is awesome - this is NOT the place for you.  If you want ACTUAL AUTHENTIC Mexican food that tastes like your favorite Mexican aunt made it with love in her own kitchen - you're in the right place.  FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot for lunch one day. As other reviews had stated there was a sewage type smell upon entering. thank god it went away when I was seated, but not a good impression. my experience gets better though. The waitress was very friendly and even though I couldn't prounouce the menu items she was very nice. I ordered a horchata, which was wonderful. Then I got a one of the chicken tostada. The sandwich was great. Nice tosted bun with lots of flavorful chicken and filling. the salad on the side was a joke though. more of a decoration than edible. A few radishes, a grilled onion, jalapeno and cucumber on top of a bite or two of lettuce. I did eat part of the onion and added the cucumber and lettuce to the tostada, but now I know what to expect next time. The free chips and salsa were so so. the salsa was very runny with little flavor. Overall because I enjoyed the food I will be back. maybe I'll try a different location, the sewage smell kind of frightens me on what's behind the scenes."}
{"text":"If you are in the area and want some good Mexican food, I strongly recommend coming here. For about $10 dollars, you can get a big sandwich. They have sandwiches that are unique and  packed with flavor. I usually get the Torta Del Rey, which is a huge tower of meat and beans, avocados, chipotle, and tomatoes. The only downside is the amount of calories coming from these sandwiches."}
{"text":"Went here while on vacation in Phoneix based on seeing it on Man vs Food. Could not have been more impressed. Food was amazing. Far above expectations.  The torta was huge and delicious. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic authentic meal at a good price!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant. The old J.B.'s building had been unoccupied for years and I was excited to see a new restaurant going in, particularly one that didn't seem to be part of a mega-chain, 'cause, really, how many Applebee's and Outbacks and Joe's Crab Shacks do we need within a ten-square-mile radius of my home? A few weeks after the \"grand opening\" traffic died down, I popped in with my boyfriend and my mother for a quick lunch.  We won't be back.  The service was dreadful, from the hostess who rolled her eyes and said, \"Come on\" as she grabbed menus and headed to a table (Really? What happened to \"Right this way\" or \"Follow me, please\") to the completely nonverbal waitress who seemed unable to do anything but point and grunt. She did her job, but it was very perfunctory. She did not say ONE word to us the entire hour or so we were there. She would bring the water pitcher to our table, lift it, and go \"Unuh?\" What? We are bilingual, and also tried to communicate in Spanish to no avail, so at some point we just quit trying. (It did occur to me that maybe she had laryngitis, or was mentally challenged or something, but in my experience, in those cases, the hostess or manager will take 20 seconds to let you know, so I think she was just a very inexperienced server or a horrifically rude person.)  Very stale chips, bland salsa that was obviously on the cusp of going \"off\"...you know that weird overripe tomato taste. It was the first time I've EVER been in a Mexican restaurant and not polished off at least one serving of chips and salsa.   I understand the fare here is supposed to be \"Mexico City\" or \"Central Mexico\" or whatever but the food was just not to my liking. There were few vegetarian options, and with a waitress who couldn't talk, I was unable to ask my usual (very few and very polite) questions about whether or not the chips were fried in lard, or if the sauce was made with chicken stock. I settled on a \"Don't ask, don't tell\" policy and ordered some sort of veggie burrito. Nothing to write home about, but edible. The onions were cooked nicely. My mother, also a vegetarian, got stuck eating the same thing. There are some \"you can order mushrooms instead of meat\" dealies, but with no way to figure out how they were prepared, I didn't want to go that route, and neither did my mother. My boyfriend ordered some sort of meat taco nonsense which he did not enjoy and did not finish. He said the meat was underseasoned and overcooked.  The dessert menu looked interesting, so we decided to split some sort of chocolate flan cake thingy. It was yummy, but obviously a frozen product.   Bottom line...if you're stuck there with some work friends, you can probably find something mildly edible. If you're into this \"style\" of cooking (I'm not sure that authentic Central Mexican cuisine consists of stale chips, rotting salsa, and burned meat, but okay) you'll probably enjoy Los Reyes. If you want to have a really good meal with super-friendly service, drive a little further (or flip a U-ey) and hit up Sahara on the NE corner of McClintock and Southern."}
{"text":"I really like this place. My food was not disappointing. I've had their tortas, specifically their Ranchera de pollo and their Torta Nortena de pollo. I liked that there was a slight bit of heat, not enough to send one running for water and not too little that one would want to douse their tortas with hot sauce. Their tortas are served with a side of potato chips. The tortas are a good size. I can finish a whole one when I'm starved, but otherwise, I take half and save it for later since the serving size was a bit much for me. Next time, I totally need to get some sopes since i have yet to find a good place yet and need to check out their Lengua torta. I have to also mention their aguas cremosas, which are delish; it's a yummy drink/dessert. Also, the staff was nice, the prices were good and its a clean lil place."}
{"text":"Landed in PHOENIX on a Friday night . Needed a place to take my family that had good food and was  family friendly but also stayed open past 9pm. This place nailed it! Service was on point. Our waiter had patience with our difficult family and the ridiculous orders we placed. The food was excellent. The fresh juices and authentic Mexican food left us in a good mood and 100% satisfied. Definitely would go back, and surely would recommend ."}
{"text":"This place is the best. I saw this place on man vs food and we decided to check it out on our way to Cali. Boy I'm glad we did. Hands down my favorite sandwich spot in Phoenix. To make things even more interesting Adam from man vs food was doing another episode on his show the day we showed up.  I was loving it.  It's kind of messed up how they moved all the regular customers to one side of the restaurant and filed on the other. Anyways, food was delicious and so fresh. They give you a lot of food for the money. We've been here twice and I promised my self anytime I'm in Arizona this is gonna be my first and last stop before I leave Phoenix.  It's a tiny restaurant so be prepared to wait for 15-30 mins depending on what time of the day you show up. It's still worth the wait."}
{"text":"What an over rated plate full of grease.. I hate when I am eating and they come sweep under my feet.. I always feel like all those particles are going to go in my food... Service sucks.. Way way over rated.."}
{"text":"So amazing! It was so good I couldn't stop eating. The customer service was excellent! :) they make these big pretty fruity drinks too. Their homemade tortillas are out of this world. I just wish they served alcohol. I will be back."}
{"text":"Fabulous, I don't are care what anyone says.  We were seated promptly, our waiter was sweet, funny and gave great recommendations when asked.  I went for the Quesadilla Estilo del Rey con Bistec (Quesadilla with with cheese, sour cream, green salsa, cilantro, onions and steak).  I wouldn't say it was stuffed with steak, it was only a few pieces, which was a let down as it was delicious.  Their sopas are excellent--instead of the kids ordering off of the kids menu, they each had a sopa and were full.  The flan--meh, I make better at home.  Over all, I would go back to have their nopales and to try other delicious items on their menu!  Everything looked so good!"}
{"text":"Aguas Frescas is why I give this place 5 stars!  The best in the Valley, try the Jugo de Verde (with lime, pineapple, cactus) and horchata and cantaloupe if they have it.  The food is also great, not the healthiest, but definitely yummy."}
{"text":"Best mexican restaurant in phoenix! The sandwiches are amazing.. You can't go wrong with one of the many choices. Don't forget to try one of their huge blended drinks.. I'd recommend the apple celery one. There is often a wait here, but it's not long and well worth it. The flan is also a great way to finish your meal!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place since I first came to Phoenix, 4 years ago.  Well, it was okay. After all this stuff I heard about these Reyes places, I must have had too high of expectations. I got enchiladas and a gordita; the enchiladas were standard Mexican restaurant fare. The gordita was, as well, but they went crazy with the cilantro so it was pretty bitter. Not having salt on the tables was annoying, speaking of that. The wife got one of the quesadillas de maíz, and it had a pretty generous meat portion; so, that was cool.  Atmosphere is typical casual Mexican restaurant (soccer on TVs, orange/brown-hued walls with generic \"Mexicanish\" things like sombrero-wearing dolls), but there are actual Mexican patrons in there; so that's a one-up for the authenticity, I reckon."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. My husband and I ordered the Hawaiian torta and I ordered horchata and we both LOVED it all. The tortas are pretty large, and I'm glad we read that they were a sharable size, since we weren't all that hungry.  Wish so much we had tortas like this one in Colorado.. will definitely be going back when we get back to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews about this place I had to check it out.                Well I'm officialy in love with Los Reyes de la Torta!Stopped in on a whim and never wanted to leave.The queso was thick and creamy and just GOOD.The torta is the biggest I've ever seen so full of flavor that hit you one after another.I almost felt bad paying them so little for such a huge meal,so I tipped generously.        So the next time your there look around,that brunette you see in the corner with a sleeping bag is me moving in and never leaving."}
{"text":"Lol they have really milked that Adam Richman visit! Haha, but whateves this place is awesome!   Best Torta: Norteña   Price with a Drink: $13   Tip: I always order to go, this place is always packed and to go orders normally take anywhere from 10-15mins."}
{"text":"Boom. This place is awesome if you are looking for a huge heart clogging sandwhich. Yummmmm"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the staff was fast and polite. I will without doubt be a regular."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. Is good. However, warning to those who are vegetarian or picky about meat: there are little to no vegetarian meals and different meats are mixed throughout the food."}
{"text":"Holy wow! Home made tortillas and everything is so fresh.  Order a drink- you will thank me later. I could easily drink one of theses a day for breakfast. One of my favorite non alcoholic drinks hands down.  While the tostas are what they are known for, the casadillas are more than amazing. The customers come in waves but the wait is short and worth it. While you are waiting you can watch the food being cooked and press their own homemade tortillas."}
{"text":"2nd time here. The food is okay nothing really special and a bit over priced for the flavor.  1st time they took forever to take our order.  2nd we got it to go. Get home and they had given us the wrong order! Call to tell them and of course i do not want to drive 10miles just to go back an exchange it.  The manager wouldn't even offer a discount or a freakin apology!  Last time I go there. I wouldn't recommend this location. Unless you want crappy service."}
{"text":"Super CHEAP and DELICIOUS!!! I tried the beef head tacos the other day. The meat just melts in your mouth and the tacos were filled with cilantro which I love. I probably could have eaten  20 orders by myself. My boyfriend had one of their sandwiches which was also really good. The customer service was great! When I asked about the different meats our server kindly brought out little bowls of each meat for us to try.  We also tried several of the desserts and everything was amazing. This was my first time there so I can't wait to try everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"I am just going to piggyback many of my fellow Yelpers here, and say that my first visit to Los Reyes de la Torta, which was for dinner tonight was as good as I have heard and hoped it would be!   My dinner company and I arrived for dinner here around 5:30pm, and the restaurant was busy but we were still seated immediately. Our waitress was at our side ready to help us immediately, and was very helpful and patient with us because we had never been here before. We ended up sitting right under the Man V Food framed and illuminated poster on the wall, and decided upon the Del Rey torta which Adam ate on the show. My guest got a diet coke and I one of the aqua frescas cantaloupe flavor and it was unbelievably refreshing and flavorful. It even came with a slice of cantaloupe on the side of the glass and I could tell the drink was freshly made just for me.  Our dinner, the Del Ray, well, it was heaven on a bun, and comprises of just about every kind of meat in existence including chorizo, ham, beef and hot dog and egg. However, the meat proteins were not too overwhelming and were balanced out very nicely by the avocado, veggies and cheese. Further, the torta bread was awesome, and retained its crispy shell and fresh, spongy inside with each bite. The sandwich was spicy but not hot (but if one chooses to put the chipotle sauce on the sammy, eater beware!). For two grown adult males, the Del Rey torta was a good meal to share with a side of rice and beans (both of which were fantastic as well!). The sandwich comes with ruffled potato chips, and my guest commented that he was surprised it did not come with tortilla chips instead, but both of us thought the salty potato chips actually enhanced the overall flavor combination of the torta and meal in general, and tasted great with the chipotle sauce.   During the meal we noticed dishes being taken to other tables and my guest and I both decided we would have to come back and try the other dishes too, as the ingredients were so authentic and fresh that I am certain all the dishes taste fantastic, as did our Del Rey.   In the end, dinner cost just over $20 including tax and tip and drinks...an awesome deal for the meal and service. Some other posters have commented on this location's lack of curb appeal and overall cultural scenery, but as someone who values food quality more than flash and trendiness, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone looking for a great meal for themselves, their partner or family night out!!!"}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch for the first time and had the del Reyes torta. I was full after one half of this monster. But was very good."}
{"text":"Delicious tortas! Very popular spot here on Yelp.  Recently on Man vs Food. This place is definitely a gem.  Wish they served beer haha. Me and my friend ate for under $20(not including tip). Which is pretty decent considering it was a sit down place. This place is worth a day trip if you're in the mood for authentic Mexican sandwiches."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!! Love, love, love this place. I got the Torta Nortena de pollo and my fiance got the chicken tacos and we were in heaven. The food was perfect. Absolutely perfect. And cheap too! This is our new favorite Mexican place.   YOU. MUST. TRY... THIS. PLACE."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, the queso appetizer is fantastic. The tortas are always amazing. Glad they opened one on this side of town, the one in glendale was really far."}
{"text":"Excellent kitchen. Great food. Ample portions. King of the Tortas! The staff are friendly and quickly move that yummy food to you. Authentic and a local gem. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Huge portions, recommend splitting a meal.  Authentic Mexico City food.  I recommend the carne asada burro with green sauce and a Mexican Coke.  It's in a sketch area of town for a gringo like myself, but so what.  The Pina Colada is by far the best one I have ever had in my entire life.  The fruit juice bar is no joke."}
{"text":"Wow! Saw this business featured on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives and loved it. Quality steak, major portions, and good prices. Not fancy atmosphere, but clean and the employees are very focus and efficient at getting the food on your table quickly and hot. I would recommend this place to anyone if the mood for a great torta!"}
{"text":"Fast service, good service & great food.  95% of items under $10.  I had the Norteña torta with steak & a papaya cremosa & both were bomb.  I think I'll try the Del Rey next time & the mango cremosa.  My girlfriend had like a chicken torta & that was very good as well.  She got a strawberry/banana cremosa which I did like better than my papaya one.  All in all I'll be back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"i saw this place on Man Vs Food. i've been to numerous restaurants that Man Vs Food and Diners,Drive-ins, and Dives has been to. the place looked great on the show. this is a small, very crowded place. i went during lunch. i have mixed reviews. the food was very authentic and good. i was very disappointed that they don't serve salsa and chips and you can't even buy them as a side. they have a large, extensive menu, but it was somewhat aggravating to read because it was a giant mish mash of foods and pictures and most everything was in spanish. so, yes, go for the food. it's cheap. authentic. no chips and salsa at all. i didn't order anything alcoholic, but the margaritas were huge. everyone was drinking some kind of fruity mixed drink and they are all very large. would i personally go out of my way to go here, no. good, yes."}
{"text":"Yay...another winning meal based on reviews from Yelpers.  Best Milanese ever.  I mistakenly thought that I'm not really into Torta.  But it just turned out that I haven't had a good one...until Los Reyes.  Now I'm a convert."}
{"text":"Los Reyes has gotten such rave reviews, perhaps my expectations were too high, but I thought that the Torta Los Reyes, their signature torta, was just a glorified Denny's Grand Slamwich with hot sauce. I didn't find the meat that flavorful, nor the sauces. That said, the restaurant is surprisingly nice inside, the service is prompt and friendly, and the mango agua fresca was amazing. Maybe I'm just not the torta type, because for the most part, I'm a healthy eater and avoid beef, pork, and ham. My dad, on the other hand, loved the torta."}
{"text":"These guys make the best aguas frescas I have had since my grandma passed away several years ago. I have been here at least 20 times since I tried it for the first time in 2013. Food has been consistently great - especially tortas and tacos - but aguas frescas is the reason why I keep coming back over and over. I do not know if they have a special formula or what, but there must be something hidden in those powerful aguas frescas. FBI should track down those watermelon aguas frescas to make sure they do not have some magic ingredient."}
{"text":"I admit it.  I found this place through Man vs Food.  It did live up to the hype and not just for the tortas.  But first, let's start with the tortas.  I can only speak for the torta del rey and it was as huge as the one on TV.  The mix of meat along with egg, tomato and avocado was delicious and the taste very unique.  Something that does not get enough attention is their large selection of fruit juices and smoothies.  Since I couldn't decide between all the juice choices, I got a plain old pina colada.  It was really good - not too sweet.  My friend was more adventurous and got some drink named _?_eskimo_?_ - also very good.  Next time I go back, I will definitely try a fruit juice.  They had a lot of fruit in their fridge so it should be good.  Another plus is their 99 cent ceviche tostada.  It is a small tostada topped with shrimp ceviche and a slice of avocado.  Very refreshing and a great way to ease yourself into consuming a torta.  Lastly, the service was good and the inside of the restaurant was bright and clean.  There is no reason not to go back.  Remember to bring your appetite because the sandwich is quite filling."}
{"text":"Definitely good food here. I've gone in 3-4 times and always gotten good service and good food. The tortas are large so be prepared to come in and get stuffed or order the \"mini\" version. Also the agua frescas with the fruit flavors are very good."}
{"text":"Great food, so-so service. We're okay with benign neglect by waitstaff but we do attempt to reinforce the importance of compliance with dairy & wheat restrictions. The neglect of waitstaff in this instance extended to neglect to notify the kitchen of our restrictions resulting in two members of our party getting cheesy dishes despite repeated admonitions, as well as subsequently switching two dishes so that someone who wanted cheese didn't get it, and other, smaller infractions. It was likely part language barrier, part didn't give a $hit. Omnivores among the group loved this place."}
{"text":"A little BIG place to enjoy delicious food, every thing on the menu sound good, from the drink to the quesadilla made in a special el Rey way. FANTASTIC!!"}
{"text":"Some of the Hottest little mamas' work here!!! Damn good food too. The crew likes this skid for the mamasitas  and tortas. If your in the slop hit this joint up. Its FRESH."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and in have to say the food is pretty good and the staff is very friendly. I've tried the Torta del Rey (about $9) and it is packed with meat, eggs, ham and many other yummy things that make it a gigantic Mexican sandwich.  I would split this with another person as it is big, unless of course you have lots of room for the entire yummy Torta.   I've also had the Carne Asada mini tacos ($5.99 for 3) served with cucumbers, lettuce and radish slices. These are good if you're not feeling extremely hungry.   There are many things on the menu including seafood and the regular burritos and typical Mexican dishes you would expect to find.  You MUST try the \"aguas naturales\" ($4) which are made with natural fruit right when you order them.  The strawberry and cantaloupe are my favorite."}
{"text":"Had the infamous Torta Del Rey. Very solid. Good amount of meat and cheese. Only complaint is that by the end of the sandwich much of the good meat was gone and it was very difficult to keep it all together ( not quite enough cheese or sauce to hold it in place). Torta was pretty big, but I expected far more mammoth of a creation after reading so many people saying they couldn't finish it.   If you are hungry it is really pretty easy to put away (of course if you get drinks or apps, or eat the generic ruffles chips, you may get full).   Good price for good quality sandwich to go with good service. Four stars!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Los Reyes de La Torta from a nearby hotel for some take-out. The food was excellent for all of us, from the 4 year old looking for a quesadilla to the 70 year old vegetarian grandmother. The service was great and the price is right. A perfect way to top off a weekend stay in Phoenix. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. Their food is delicious, their service is good, their location is convenient and their prices affordable. In my opinion and my opinion only, if this place had a liquor license, the line to get in was going to be longer than the Great Wall of China.  So why am I giving them four stars? I am tired of caring my tequila flask and ordering virgin drinks. That's all."}
{"text":"This place makes Mexico City style chow. Nothing fancy just simple tasty food. If you are a Paleo diet (or just low carb) check out the Nopales con Pollo..very clean eating!"}
{"text":"My family and I had our first experience at Los Reyes de la Torta this weekend.  I must admit, we had never heard of it before watching \"Man vs. Food\".  We knew immediately we had to try it.  What we got was a real treat!  The food and the service are amazing!  Of course, I had to try the famous Del Ray Torta.  It is HUGE!  My daughter and I spilt it.   It was probably one of the best things I have ever tasted in my life! We can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu.  All the employees were so friendly.  Our server checked on us several times.  Service with a smile is something that you will find here!!  If you are looking for authentic, amazing Mexican food, then look no further! :-)"}
{"text":"I had seen this restaurant on yelp and decided to give it a try. I'm new to the area here for a short time trying different places. The service was good the atmosphere was welcoming. I thought the asada torta I had was tasty but I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had. The meat was seasoned well but I prefer it chopped instead of sliced.  The chicken tacos were so so. I will be visiting again to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Listen, don't let the location fool you, this place is awesome... go, go, go... the food, the service, the food, the fooooooddd...! super yummy... super delish.  Listen, you must try it, the place is clean, feels like home.   I super recommend this place, even if you pick it up and take it home... do it, try it.  Try the Torta Nortena beef or chicken.  I love the shrimp tostadas... the hamburgers are amazing too... go, and go soon..."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience when I went for lunch yesterday with a friend. The table we were sat at did not have utensils and I finally grabbed some from a neighboring table. The waiter who gave us our chips and salsa pointed out which was  spicy and which was normal, although upon tasting them the normal was spicier than the supposed \"spicy\" which was not hot at all. It took 30 minutes to receive our food after ordering. Our waitress, although not expressly rude, had a very cold and uninviting demeanor.   However, the food was fantastic. I hope they can work on bettering their service because they do have potential to be a successful restaurant."}
{"text":"Flavorless. Almost no veg options. Bland hot sauce.My husband likes  it so I have to keep going there."}
{"text":"I had to leave because the host seated people who got there after we did. She seated them n told  them o I made a mistake but that's ok. It seemed like she knew them. She was talking to them n laughing..that's not right. my kids were hungry and she did it again after we were told they had a table almost ready. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"my cousins and i were gong to go here but we were turned away because of my service dog. i guess in tempe the laws don't matter to some establishments?"}
{"text":"Best food ever ;) Oscar the server was amazing with the kids too. If you haven't been this is a must go!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  We go there for the food . And the service . They do not have a bar , but it is OK. You still can have a great dinner at a very reasonable price. On the way home stop somewhere for a margarita .  Love the tortas , their specialty .  Great place to take people from out of town."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a long hike nearby and yelped for something quick and delicious when we were done. I recognized Reynas from Man vs. Food, so we decided to give it a try. We weren't disappointed. The frescos and totras were amazing! Perfect for after hiking!  We live in Seattle and have nothing that compares. The servers were so sweet and took great care of us, the food was delivered very quickly. I can't wait to return and try the ceviches. We will definitely be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Highly recommend, totally satisfied, great customer service, respected wait time and the food was very good! First time, wont be my last. Wife and I enjoyed our experience and look forward to coming again. Both originally from California so don't know of many places however this is the best so far!"}
{"text":"For lunch this is my go-to spot for either a Mexicana torta or a carne asada torta to go. My food is always ready in 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food from the Federal District. Fresh and delicious along with great service make this the place to go in the North Valley."}
{"text":"I had the Ribeye torta and it was AMAZING!!! The meat was super tender, and the bread was so soft! The place was a little hard to find, but overall I was very pleased that I took the time to find it!"}
{"text":"Awesome Frescas! The tortas are original combos, and although I chose a basic chicken combo, it was great! Different than the typical southwestern fare found in Phoenix..."}
{"text":"Some of the best food and salsa I've had in a looooong time!  Service also excellent."}
{"text":"What this place does, it does well.  The tortas are huge and flavorful!  If you're looking for healthy, you won't find it here.  If you're looking for a gnarly, greasy, massive sandwich, you came to the right place.  Hungover?  This is your spot.  On a diet?  This is not.  I recommend everybody try it at least once."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on a tip from a friend at work and glad I did. I tried the Del Rey which is thier largest sandwhich, Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, sausage, chorizo, tomato, lettuce, avocado, eggs and who knows what else was on there. I could only eat half. Now I have never had a Torta before so I have nothing to compare it to, But it was delish, my wife has a burrito which she also liked. Service was excellant, very friendly staff. They were playing Vicente Fernandez videos on the flat screens why we were there for luch providing some background ambience.  For Dessert we had Fresas Con Crema which was to die for. It wasn't on the menu, so just request it.  The only con was the limited parking but well worth waiting to find a parking spot. Can't wait to go back I heard the ceviche rocks."}
{"text":"the quesadillas estilo el rey are 10/10 and the agua de fresa is dank!! one of my favorite places to eat at when I'm in Arizona"}
{"text":"Everyone I have told about this place is like \"wtf is a torta.\"  I have to bring  them because it can not be described it has to be experienced."}
{"text":"This place is always busy however your waitress is always on her game and always courteous. Really should have more waitress's like this place does. Food is healthy not all of their dishes are carb loaded. I love how they prepare the Nopales.  They have veggie & fruit juices freshly made as you order. I love their V8 veggie drink."}
{"text":"Best tortas eva !! Big and good make them how you like and if you dont like or think its burn you ask and you can get a better one"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings for Los Reyes de la Torta.  A craving after seeing the mouth-watering Man vs. Food episode sent me to the restaurant.  While my stomach wasn't ready for the infamous torta, I tried a meat combo plate.  What were labeled as \"sausages\" were sliced hot dogs, and the ham was essentially thin sandwich meat heated on a grill.  On a positive note, the guacamole and salsas are delicious and worth trying which gives the extra star.  I plan on going back to the restaurant to try the Torta del Rey and hopefully increase the rating."}
{"text":"First time visit for me today. I had the Del Ray, which was very good. The atmosphere was nice, and the staff was very friendly. I will definitely be back. The only downside I can think of is it was a bit loud due to being a busy Saturday, and the sound echoing off the concrete floor. Otherwise the experience was great."}
{"text":"So incredibly good and cheap! I crave the bistec quesadilla. I haven't ordered anything else because it is so good! Great hot sauce, lots of vegetarian options for my hubby. Kids love it! This is a family favorite."}
{"text":"Los Reyes de la Torta serves fairly authentic Mexican food.  Services is efficient and friendly.  The restaurant was pleasantly not crowded when we came here for a Sunday lunch.  Chips and salsa immediately arrived, and the food was surprisingly quick to arrive after we ordered.  The Del Rey is one of their biggest tortas - ham, cheese, pork, hot dog omelet, and more!  Of course, I had to give this a try since it sounds like a meat lovers dream.  I have to say - it is a little TOO flavorful.  The combination of meats, egg, cheese, and avocado kind of blend together.  While it's not at all bad per se, the tastiness of each ingredient is overwhelmed.  Eh...worth a try anyway.  Burritos were good.  Nice grilled texture, and perfect ratio of ingredients - you have a wide variety of filling choices.  There's also a nice selection of plated entrees.  Price is reasonable - $4 to $10 per dish.  The decor is also nice.  I was expecting a dive-type hole in the wall, but it's actually fairly clean (though I didn't use the restroom and can't judge there)."}
{"text":"this is a legit mexican food restaurant !!  Jaquie is the best!!:) we always look for good mexican food and torta king has best food and great service"}
{"text":"Beware of this restaurant when you ask for the check, they will not show the price of each thing you order. They just give you a total, you don`t even know what are you paying for, because you just get the total of what you consume they can charge you more and you don`t even know and I think this is against the consumers law because the customer have to know what they are paying for otherwise any business can rip you off your money and charge whatever they want.I never went to a restaurant that did not give the customer the list of what it consumed with the price."}
{"text":"Very good mexican place. Quite dive/hole in the wall, and the neighborhood isn't the best, but don't be intimidated. They truly have amazing, authentic mexican food. It is always clean when I go there, the food is fresh and portion size quite generous. I'd describe it is Mexico City food rather than street food. I appreciate the detail they put into their cooking including plates that are always garnished to perfection. Worth a trip"}
{"text":"They specialize in the tortas (sandwiches) but I judge all types of Mexican restaurants by their frijoles... and these were great. They were frijoles like my tia used to make. Though I could have done without the extra cheese on top. Large portions, great flavors, solid service and CHEAP! I was stuffed on the chicken tacos and still had leftovers for a whole 'nother 2 meals. Sheesh! This visit and choice by Cookie totally makes up for the catastrophe known as Vitamin T in downtown. My new go to place for Mexican food. Muchas gracias!"}
{"text":"Our office just relocated to this area and today we had lunch from Los Reyes De La Torta.  Everything we ordered was delicious and prepared promptly. The staff was especially nice and even let me have this cute teddy when I asked for it.  Highly recommend and will visit this place many times over."}
{"text":"It is a small hole in the wall kind of place. When we went in today, the place was full of people. The service was good and the waiter was quick. I would give the Place a 3.5 rating.  The vegetarian and chicken burritos we ordered were flavorful and delicious."}
{"text":"Don't let that of the margarita above fool you-- this place does not have a liquor license!  Dad was in town so we thought we'd head over and have some mexican food and a beer, maybe some chips and salsa to find that there is no alcoholic beer and no fried fatty chips- only ruffles. remember those?!  Food is great, cheap. But it's Mexican and I expect a Dos Equis and some chips and salsa!!   I'll be back...... for take out."}
{"text":"Absolutely a delicious blend of flavors. The uniqueness of each type of torta makes the menu enough to entertain my pallet no matter what my mood.   I recommend their Aguas Frescas as well. :)"}
{"text":"After reading Rand's review about a month ago, I just I knew had to check this place out! I stopped by Monday after work with a list of items I'd like to try (I looked at their menu online before coming in). I ordered way too much for my husband & I, but it was my 1st time so I had to try a lil bit of everything. I got the following: shrimp ceviche tostada, carne asada burrito, carne asada tacos w/a side of rice & beans, cheese quesadilla (flour tortilla), carne asada quesadilla (corn tortilla, handmade!) \"estilo del rey\" style (meaning it's topped with cheese, sour cream & cilantro) & lastly a slice of chocoflan for dessert.   I had the tostada, burrito & carne asada quesadilla (over the course of 3 meals, btw) & all were excellent! Although, instead of shrimp I received chicken. It was still delicious but I was excited to try the shrimp, next time. The burrito had a lil kick to it & the meat was seasoned perfectly. The quesadilla was beyond amazing, I don't think I can ever eat a quesadilla again w/out getting it \"estilo del rey\" style, freakin yum! My hubby had the tacos, cheese quesadilla & half of my burrito. He thoroughly enjoyed everything & made 2 meals out of it. The chocoflan was chocolate cake topped w/a thick layer of flan. I didn't really care for the flan topping but the cake was tasty, super moist!   Total for all that food was about $33, which I find totally reasonable. I can say that this is one of the top places for Mexican in Phoenix. I can't wait to return & try all the other yummy things they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Had about 2 hours of fun at the phx MVD and thought i would reward myself for dealing with that, so I yelped what was near and guess what shows up! I had no idea they had more locations, i thought it was only the one from man v food...   Walked in and first thing that happens is that im welcomed by the owner... I ask for a recommendation, and he recommends El Rey ( The King) Its a big torta so I opted for the smaller Especial... the same sandwich except without the egg  , chorizo, and sausage omlette! I also got a agua de pina (fresh pineapple juice)... legit! I would go back for that alone... the torta was big.... maybe to big... but hey... man v food did go there for the challenge so expect it!    The torta was good, had different cuts of pork in it and i think a slice of breaded beef! The neighborhood could be considered not desirable, but get over it, the place is fine... i usually judge a place based on whether or not i would return... for the food, service, and atmosphere.  The answer is yes, i am going back to try some other stuff on their menu, the service was quick and the waitresses were nice, the food was good especially the juices, and the atmosphere was whatever... but yes i will return to get me some fuel soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I moved here from Anaheim CA about two years ago and I was having a horrible experience finding a Mexican or torta or taco place because most Mexican places I went here in Phoenix is \"Sonoran\"  or \"northern\" style cuisine. They make tortas just like the ones in the D.F. city or Cuernavaca Morelos!!! In addition they have Esquimos, which I love (it's a drink) so I've been coming to place at least once a month. It is in a small location parking and wait time is horrible, but we'll worth the wait, that's why I put 4 abd not 5, they NEED a bigger location.  The outside is not very attractive, I almost didn't go in, there's usually a waiting time to be seated. They make the food fresh so it also takes a while. Do not go when your starving because, it does take time! They also gave a \"kids menu\" the portions on those are a bit big in my 4yr niece only eats 1/4 to 1/2. The tortas comes with \"chips\" aka ruffle looking salted potato chips like regular lays, or a salad consisting of lettuce and a couple of cucumber slides. I loved that this they served the salad with cut lime, ( just like my mother, they must be from the same place) no dressing so I don't have to worry about telling \"NO DRESSING\". If you do go, try one of their delicious natural fruit water, they also have fresh juices."}
{"text":"The torta del ray is huge and good, after I eat this huge torta, it was instant food coma. I didn't eat the next day since I was still full. The place is small but clean, staff is friendly.  I will be back when I recovered from my food coma"}
{"text":"I've been here SO many times. The tortas are SO good. The ceviche tostadas that $.99 are SO good. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Ever since I saw their sandwich featured on the Travel Channel, I have been wanting to try it.  Our recent trip to Phoenix finally made that happen.  My family got there before noon on a Sunday and we did not wait long.  On our way out there was a big crowd waiting so we were fortunate enough to have been seated in less than 10 minutes.  I have seen good reviews on their Aguas Frescas so we decided to try the Lime and Cantaloupe.  Both were very good and very refreshing, the lime reminded me of a lemonade slush.  We had the Queso Fundido with chorizo for appetizer, it came with chips, flour tortilla and pico de gallo and it was delicious.  The queso had the right amount of chorizo, a little greasy but that is expected from chorizo.  We ordered the Del Rey and Milanesa de pollo torta. The sandwiches were huge so half order per person was the perfect portion for us. The Milanesa de pollo was just ok but the Del Rey I really liked.  Avocado, chorizo, breaded beef, pork, ham, hot dog, omelet, refried beans and cheese all in a sandwich.  It was very tasty and there were so many different flavors going on.  It was great meal overall!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast on Sunday and despite the unassuming exterior found the restaurant and food to be good. I ordered ham and eggs which was good, but not great. My brother got the torta and it was certainly filling and tasty. I can't say it was the best breakfast I've had but was a food home cooked Mexican breakfast which was a welcomed taste of home for a Texas girl living in Georgia."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the Slope and glad that Los Reyes reigns supreme here. The tortas (Mexican sandwiches) are huge, they are delicious, and they will, they will, rock you. But what else would you expect from Los Reyes de la Torta? What you might not know is that their non-torta items are at least as good. Whatever the cheese they use (a white cheese, cotija maybe?) is delicious, not like the cheese used typically at the more Americanized places (which are also good, not trying to knock those). And the aguas frescas are very tasty as well; it's like drinking fruit! This place lives up to the hype so go check it out, but be prepared to wait because it's usually busy even during the week."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on a recommendation from a hotel employee. We were both extremely satisfied with the quality of food, the service and atmosphere! My husband ordered the Cubana mini and I ordered the quesadilla de asada. Both were extremely delicious and filling! Would highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!  The sandwiches were the \"bomb\"!  I was a little unsure about the location but the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Love this place, great prices, excellent home-style food and friendly services. Be sure and order an Agua Fresca which they blend to order are quite filling so you may want to share. The homemade salsas are excellent. My favorite dish is the Alambre de Res o Pollo, chopped steak or chicken with pepper, onions, bacon and side of rice, beans Guac, grilled jalapeno and tortillas."}
{"text":"My friend and I love to try new restaurants. We saw this one on food network and decided to try. The first thing I ordered was a margarita...THEY HAVE NO ALCOHOL. We order drinks with every dinner so no alcohol is kind of a big deal. Other than that we ordered and split the del ray then ordered a quesadilla to go. The Del Ray was fantastic and the Bistec quesadilla was the best quesadilla I've ever had. I would definitely go back for the food.... but come on guys...lets get a liquor license!"}
{"text":"This is great restaurant. Tortas are huge. Friendly people and service. The wife and I will be back."}
{"text":"Service was good and food was awesome. I got the steak Tacos with rice and beans.  The tacos were great and it was a  lot of food. I would recommend it if your in the area."}
{"text":"Service was great, nice Mexican atmosphere, excellent torta's. Shared the big one w/my son; had to take leftovers home."}
{"text":"I usually go during the lunch hour. The place is always busy and very popular. The crew is hustling about, helping customers and they're courteous, friendly, and eager to help. The smell of food fills the air and it's plenty loud with conversation and kitchen activity.   The portions are normally hefty; you will not leave hungry. The food is fresh and always tasty. It's a little on the greasy side, but as much as one might expect from a local favorite Mexican food restaurant.   The place is on a crappy-looking strip mall with limited parking. It's not very good looking and the dining area feels slightly cramped. However, the service and food make up for it. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Went back with some veggie friends of mine and wasn't disappointed.  One of them ordered the regular flour quesadilla, and they loved it.  It had veggie stuff on the inside and I tasted a bite which was delicious.  I will probably order this next time I go.  Also, the grilled onion which came on the side was a big hit.  The other friend ordered the mushroom corn quesadilla.  She liked it but didn't love it.  I had the shrimp tacos and, wow, were they good.    I don't know why, with all the tortas on the menu, but I just seem to prefer the other menu items.  As always, the service was great, and it was very, very busy.  We had to wait to be seated.    Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best Tortas in town by far have had pretty much everyone they make ans all have been fantastic. Service is always great, and the place is neat for the age of the building. When craving tortas here is where I go first."}
{"text":"Met some friends there with no idea what to expect. All 4 of us were delighted with what we found. Great food, great service! We can hardly wait to go back! The carne asada tacos were seasoned perfectly and the chicken green chili enchiladas made me swoon."}
{"text":"Love this place been here a couple of times, and the food it's really good and a lot!!! Love the flavours so autentic, the place is so clean and the customer service is really friendly, my favourite plate it's the sopes, so big and good. Love it here!!!"}
{"text":"Being in Phoenix for the summer, I decided to get Los Reyes De La Torta a shot instead of La Tolteca, which is a much shorter drive from where I am living.   Went at about 6:30 on a Sunday evening with a buddie and had no wait at all. Good atmosphere. Had great, prompt service. Our waitress never let our drinks get below half way and was simply fantastic. Restaurant is in a small plaza but does not feel (and is not) dirty or grungy or anything of that sort. I ordered the Del Rey while my friend ordered the beef tongue torta. Both came out in about fifteen minutes just as we ordered them. Once again, very very good service.   The only reason I am not giving Los Reyes five stars is probably my own fault. I got the Del Rey because of all I had heard about it, but probably should have gotten something that is more my taste. However, the sandwich was fantastic, the meat was juicy and tender, and the egg and avocado made it truly enjoyable. No complaints about the beef tongue either.  All in all, if you are in the neighborhood give this place a shot. Great service, very good food, and very affordable. I will definitely try to make the drive again while I am in town."}
{"text":"No french fries: strike one Waitresses are pretty but really slow; not rude but indifferent. They decided to clean the floor around us with a huge amount of bleach: gross fumes :( My torta de pierna was delicious but not so much so that it makes me want to come back. Sorry. I just had a bad enough experience to not want to come back."}
{"text":"We're two parents and two teenagers and are from way out of state for spring break in AZ.  Stumbled into this place on our first night, and liked it so much that we had our last dinner here too.  We liked it for being an unpretentious and family-friendly neighborhood place with surprisingly good food.  We particularly liked the Plato de Alambre de Camarón and the Quesadilla de Alambre de Camarón, both of which feature their grilled shrimp.  So good."}
{"text":"We arrived at Los Reyes and was promptly seated. After about ten minutes the waitress came to take our order. We ordered one piña colada and two margaritas. Come to find they were non alcoholic, which was not apparent when ordering from the menu. The food was así así and service was mediocre at best. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place has great food and amazing shakes.  Love the queso and the watermelon and cantaloupe shakes.  Would recommend to anyone.  Just make sure to get there early cause can sometimes be a little wait to get seated but that's when you know you've found a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Great friendly service & fresh food. Been here multiple times and will continue to come back. Great menu"}
{"text":"This is a great Mexican food restaurant. Very authentic, I felt like I was in Mexico! The food is amazing the servings are huge and the price is cheap! Just wish it wasnt so far from my house."}
{"text":"So I was excited to eat here because of the reviews.  I was believing the hype that it was going to be great.  First the workers were rude horrible customer service very disappointed there.  And the food wasn't great it was ok I have had better Mexican food and for the price to me it was a little bit expensive. Over all i did not like this place and would not come back."}
{"text":"parking outside is a little annoying, we usually end up driving through the lot 3 or 4 times before finding a parking spot.  we've only had to wait to be seated once, and it wasn't too bad of a wait; about 15 minutes. the food is always delicious! the food is the only reason we keep going back because the people inside aren't the best, they usually don't come to offer drinks. they come straight to take the order and we have to order our drink with our food or you won't get a drink at all. then you have to wait to get your drinks until we get our food. usually the waitress comes back a total of 3 times? take order. drop off order. leave check.  bottom line -- awesome food.  the mexicana torta with chips instead of a salad is where it's at :) yum."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Best Mexican restaurant ever. This is real Mexican food unlike other places. The servers were lovely and the atmosphere was great. Everyone was friendly ."}
{"text":"The bombest Tortas and Juego in Northside Phoenix...."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS A SLEEPER  This place is nothing more than a sandwich shop with seats... and a little run down. Over the years, the celebrity chefs that have TV programs, i.e. Guy Fieri, Adam Richman, etc., in my opinion have been right less than half of the time with their suggestions. This one though is a WINNER! We both had the steak with queso fresco and avocado on a Mexican roll... DEEELICIOUS! Score 1 for Man vs. Food.  No alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place so we decided to do the drive up to North Phoenix.   I walked in and the whole \"Man vs Food\" situation was posted everywhere.  I decided to order the claim to fame giant king cavalier torta. I ordered an agua de piña and it was great and when i asked for chips and salsa the server said they only had potato chips and no tortilla chips.............. (weird)........ Ok- so no chips LOL.  The torta arrived and it was HUGE!!! So I'm all excited about this giant Mexican sandwich but then I realized that I'm not going to be able to bite into it because it's so huge (that's what she said- I know) ok so I split the sandwich in half to only have one top portion half to start ingesting.  There is every animal inside of this thing. Literally.  Ham, pork chop, hot dog, shredded chicken, carne Asada, and fried chicken, and chicken fried steak ( I think?) ok so like the top half started out good but then I got grossed out with all the meat and then took off the fried chicken an chicken fried steak.  Then I threw off the hot dogs.  Then I just decided I was disgusted and just left it.  I honestly thought I was going to vomit on the way home because I just ingested who knows how many calories and didn't even find joy in it.  Oh- and our bill was $38.00 (the sandwich is $20 alone plus I got the agua de piña and a sprite.  I tried it at least? Bleh."}
{"text":"I've eaten in this restaurant 2 times.  My wife had been wanting to try this restaurant. Food is good but they have no fresh spicy sauce or store bought hot sauce at all.  I'm a chili head, even Denny's has tabasco, is this a Mexican restaurant or McDonalds?  This place is WAY OVER RATED!    The 2 times I ate there they overcharged me, BEWARE, check your bill twice, three times before you pay!!!  I would strongly suggest dinning at a torta place on 24th street just north of McDowell Rd.  Way better service, MUCH BETTER FLAVOR, less expensive... overall, better restaurant.  DON'T GO TO THIS RESTAURANT IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Thanks to Man vs. Food I ate possibly the best torta sandwich ever! The torta del rey had a plenty of meat and the watermelon aqua was to die for. If I was ever was on death row and I had to pick a last meal then the torta del rey would be a top candidate.    Not only was the food mind-blowingly addictive but the service was top notch as well. Our server was not only helpful and fast but she was also extremely courteous and professional.   I only wish that there could be a location somewhere in Los Angeles because then I would go every single week.   Simply put this restaurant is outstanding.  Go, NOW! To unbelievably delicious eatings!! :D"}
{"text":"My first torta ever. It was huge with FIVE different kinds of meat plus egg. Excellent! Ruffle potato chips out of the bag on the side was a disappointment. Atmosphere is nothing special, a little divey, but good service. Will definitely go back and check out other offerings."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick bite of fast/mexican food.  The have great sandwiches.  Be prepared to be full and stuffed.  My friends are the sandwich and liked it. I had burrito which was super rich.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Real authentic Mexican food! I read a few reviews and as a Mexican American brought up eating Mexican food; I have to say by far this place takes the win over most restaurants I've been to.  Deliciososo!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple of times.  It is a hole in the wall in Sunnyslope, not fancy at all, but the food is awesome!  This time we had the Torta Nortena de Pollo and the regular size Shrimp Ceviche Tostada (both items shared between two people).  I also had a  delicious pineapple Agua Fresca.  I was glad we did not each order a torta because it would have been too much food.  The torta was very good and the ceviche was heaping and tasty (we ordered it on two tostada shells instead of one).  Great value for the price and service staff was very attentive.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent!!!  The food is typical of Mexico City and not what you usually find at the popular Mexican restaurants in town.  The tortas are yummy and so are the corn tortilla quesadillas.  Big portions, plenty of menu items and great prices. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was fooled by the ratings. The carne Asada definitely didn't live up to the 5 stars. It was very plain and tasteless. Only thing you could taste was the salt that I covered my tacos in. The ceviche was horrible. Need new chef and new ideas immediately. I would recommend most wanted tacos down the street for real tacos lol don't be fooled by the ratings like I was. You'll thank me for it."}
{"text":"I think everything there is really good, I did ask for some many things from their menu and never get disappointed. The price is fair since you end up full! so if you never been there before, do yourself a favor and stop by, it is 100% worthy!"}
{"text":"Had to try the new torta place in town! I went for lunch with mom and son and had the milanesa torta. It was so yummy! The agua fresca made my day (try the mango)! The service was good and the pricing was decent. I would go back... especially for the agua fresca. Mmm!"}
{"text":"I started eating at Los Reyes almost 15 years ago and I keep going back. The food is the star of this show. Always have had great service. One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Great torta! I saw this place on Man v. Food and checked it out. Great torta, super friendly service, kind of dated inside but it lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"The food...especially the tortas and the quesadillas...is fantastic, the best I've had ever. Fresh corn tortillas made per order and an array of aqua frescas bump this hole-in-the-wall restaurant into my top 10 in the city!! Service was great, food phenomenal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, people is so polite, place is clean, the food is amazing, service is awesome. We're from California and as soon as my husband knew we were coming the first thing he said was \"we have to go to TORTAS LOS REYES\" we've been here since Saturday, today is Monday we're going back home and before we go we had to visit and we weren't disappointed, we are definitely coming back whenever we visit Phoenix. Keep like this and I might move here (mmmmm no I don't think so) But yeah out visit was great I'll never forget the great service we got. Our friend is very picky with everything specially food and he said he's coming back at least twice a month, so this place is definitely great. Good job guys. I'm very proud of my people, we're very hard working people"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Food is fresh and made well. I do find that occasionally it is over salted. But if you ask for no salt they are okay with that request.  Order the King Tacos. Super delicious and the fresh veggies that come on the plate are so welcome to an already great meal. The Agua Frescas are always yummy.  It is very busy. But if you go at a off time it's easy to get in."}
{"text":"Any old friend took my party here on a recent visit back to Arizona and this place did not disappoint. (Well, except the for the fact there's no beer/wine/alcohol.) My friend and I ordered two giant tortas. I remember mine having steak, pork tenderloin, ham, chorizo and two fried eggs, avocado, etc. It was a heavy sandwich and came with ruffles chips. The sandwich burst with bold Mexican flavors. I washed it all down with a giant order of michelada, with full celery stalk. My sister order camarones (shrimp) and her fiance ordered nachos. Both dishes received high remarks.  This place offers traditional Mexican fare and a dozen crazy tortas. My friend said this restaurant can get packed, with lines of people waiting for a  table. It is a place not to be missed."}
{"text":"I frequent Torta De La Reyes in Sunnyslope regularly. It is a great place to eat. I saw that they had one at Vee Quiva Casino and said well I might as well try that one also. The lady at the counter was less than pleasant. I ordered the Carne Asada Torta. Once I got my food I asked for salsa and the lady told me that it would be 53 cents. I have to buy salsa at a Mexican eatery? Wth? The Torta tasted very good so that is why they got three stars but the rest was disappointing."}
{"text":"Love, love, love!  The new lunch menu is great; cheap too!  I always get the egg and chorizo burrito and it comes with rice and beans, Yum!    My friend loves the chocoflan dessert they have and I like the tres lechwe cake"}
{"text":"bomb bomb bomb .... the food was amazing !!! service was great ! everything we ordered had that thick maiz tortilla! just like my grandmother used to make them .... didn't find this place intentionally didn't even know about it. we where on our way home and where hungry ... and seen this place so decided to stop... i am glad we did !! food was so good i ate mines really quick and wanted to finish everyone elses on the table however they wanted to take it to go! just my luck  im in the car now literally feel like im about to go into a food coma ... nighty night !!!"}
{"text":"Very clean place. Well served platters for a reasonable price. My favorite thing to order is the Quesadilla Estilo El Rey with Chicharron Prensado. Great priced at $12 and it is big enough to feed 2 very well."}
{"text":"Chilaquiles had a good sauce, salsa was great. Service warm. Carne asada tacos were delicious. I had mango agua fresca and it delivered"}
{"text":"What to say about this place? Great food, great service and the location is great if you like to hike North Mountain a lot :-)  I'm no expert with Tortas but this place has some amazing ones which will fill you up with lunch and dinner! Being a long time fan of Travel Channel's \"Man vs Food\" I've been meaning to try this place for some time now. Glad I did. Sure you will too."}
{"text":"Yum. I am a regular it's delicious, quick and cheap.  I love the milkshakes there are so many to choose from and huge.  Everything I have tried has been great.  Its different than the regular Mexican restaurants I have been to which is awesome.  I am not a big fan of refried beans and cheese on everything I eat.  A great little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Man, what I wouldn't give to be elbow deep in another Torta Del Rey right now.   We were half way through our Phoenix/Tucson Man v. Food tour before we finally made it to Los Reyes de la Torta. We arrived after the lunch rush and got seated right away. Everyone was speaking Spanish so it felt like we were in some exotic locale and not north Phoenix.   They don't serve alcohol here but my wife had the Margarita anyhow. It was so good and so was my iced tea. We ordered and tried to make conversation with the waitress but she just smiled and nodded... I really need to bone up on my Spanish.   It was a bit of a spiritual moment for me when she came back and laid that giant torta in front of me. After collecting my wits, I snapped a photo and began looking for a handhold to collect my prize. The first bite was amazing... The bun was softer than I expected and had nice charred bits for a distinct barbecue flavor. The layers of meat, cheese and veggies (the avocado was plentiful and fresh!) provided heavenly bite variety and before I knew it half was gone and I was pleasantly full.   We packed up our leftovers and wandered the restaurant for a bit before our touristy activities caught the attention of the staff. We spoke at length to a friendly staffer (seemed to have owner-like knowledge) and left feeling like a treasured guest and friend of the family.   I miss you Los Reyes de la Torta!"}
{"text":"Not worth the hype. All the praise must be from people who don't know good Mexican food. The torta at Los Toquitos is hands down better. Sad to say, even Filibertos torta is probably better. The beans taste like doctored up canned beans and the rice is very plain. Good Mexican food in the Phoenix area is Guadalajara Comedor, Poncho's on S. Central, Los Toquitos and Rosita's Place on McDowell. Los Reyes, take a que from them."}
{"text":"The tortas were ehhh. The salsa was so so. I am not sure if it would eat here again.  Everything was mediocre. Not sure how this place got four and half stars. My three are pushing it."}
{"text":"A yummy Mexican Sunnyslope dive.  The oatmeal horchata is tasty!  THE torta is really an experience!"}
{"text":"The yummiest Tortas around!!! The salsa verde is so scrumptious, and the service is impeccable. Thank you for a great meal and great service. Please do not change!"}
{"text":"After reading many rave reviews my girl and I decided to go there for an early dinner last night. We ordered a carne asada quesadilla as an appetizer to share. I am not exaggerating one bit when I say it was the greatest quesadilla she and I both have EVER had! I had an agua de limon to drink and it was amazing! We both had the Ranchera de Pollo Torta and it was pretty good in my opinion, she thought it was just ok. I cannot wait to go back and try more of their delicious food! I have decided that besides the amazing quesadillas and good aguas frescas this place is just average."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in the other day for the tortas.  We had been reading the good reviews and wanted to try.  Maybe we hit an off day because the meat I had in the Torta Del Rey was dry.  My friend had the Ranchera de Res o Pollo and most of the chicken was dry and very tough.  We might try again but she suggested another place where she had good tortas."}
{"text":"I decided to come here after the Man V. Food episode.   Let me start of by saying TORTA. This place does one thing very well and that is make Tortas. Obviously I ordered the Torta Del Rey and split it with a friend and I was literally still blown away by the size. So many meats and proteins but there is still some a balance that makes this the king of the tortas.   However, I only gave this place 4 stars because Tortas are the only thing they do well (which is a little unfair). The huaraches and the different juices were only marginal and not worth ordering again. Stick to the Tortas and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not greatest place to get food in Phoenix, but definitely interesting. They had recently lost their liquor license so that was a bummer, but the good thing was that when I went, it was empty.  It was clean and the wait staff was very friendly. The food was good but nothing special. Only reason I came here was because I saw it on Man vs Food. They have a food challenge that's not anything to write home about. I think the best part of this place would probably the wait staff. I remember them being very kind and helpful, very fast and very nice.  If you're looking for something that's gunna blow your mind, this isn't it. It's great to go and try the food challenge or if you're in the mood for inexpensive decent food."}
{"text":"Los Reyes de la Torta translates into the Kings of the Mexican Sandwich! And when they serve you that plate of torta, oh man, how can you not feel like a king?!  This thing is absolutely packed with every ingredient that they could've thought of. Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, sausage, chorizo and eggs. All enlightened with tomato, onions, jalapeño and avocado. Ya it may seem like a massive cluster and it really is, but for some reason, everything works awesome together like a fully realized superhero team. So props to these guys for pulling it off!  Ingredients had to be fresh and good quality. Otherwise, the whole sandwich would've been thrown off. Especially the pork sirloin, that stuff was juicy and delicious and grounded the whole experience in deliciousness!  Definitely coming back once my gut heals from the distension because the size of these tortas are no joke and could trip up a giant!"}
{"text":"they started off with chips and 3 different types of salsas, each 1 better than the next, the shrimp ceviche was to die for! I had never had a torta until now and I can't believe I've missed out this place the 8 years I've lived in phoenix... I left this place wanting more. we had the carne asada taco and the steak norteno torta w chipotle mayo grilled onions avacado and tomato! we left this place full as can bee and for cheap! safe to say we will be back!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place and will definitely go back but its far from perfect. Not the cleanest or nicest place, but that's cool with me I'm used to going to crappy run down spots in Chicago that have amazing food. I got the Del Ray Torta, OMG it was crazy! Sooo good though! Its like the biggest sandwich I've ever had. I also had the watermelon juice that was so delicious!   Disappointments include:  music that was too loud no tortilla chips?! they only have ruffles!"}
{"text":"When I brought my 100% mexican staff to this 100% cracker dominated restaurant during lunch, they looked at me skeptically, rolled their eyes, and said something under their breath in Spanish that I knew was derogatory.  Something about chinita and something about mexican food (I can understand bits and pieces of Spanish, since I'm surrounded by my staff more than I spend with my Love and family)     Hold on, give it a chance!  I tell them.... They look at me and say, yah, like when you took us to Barrio Cafe, only dirtier and still filled with crackers, only this time, there are more mexican servers.     So, I took the liberty of ordering my FAVE torta in the world, and that would be el Americano and ordered the fresca juices to wash it down.   So, they decided to order the same thing just to humor me....     ....And after their first bite of the giant torta and by the look on their faces afterwards, I was satisfied.     \"Si mon!\" was their response.  How did you find this place, THEY ASKED ME....   hah....."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical when a coworker followed our bosses recommendation of  this place for lunch last week; what does a suit know about Mexican food?   Our party of 3 arrived at 1145, a tricky time for Friday lunch. We were promptly seated to a clean table and I noticed the other tables were also getting cleaned quickly. Having worked in the industry for several years, I notice this sort of stuff and appreciate a quickly bussed dining room.   Most of the staff are Spanish speaking but my gringo lunch pals had no problem getting by with their Spanglish and innocent, pleading looks.   I scanned the menu and quickly spotted the \"home make corn tortillas\" for the quesadillas. I asked the server and she confirmed that this was only for the Estilo del Rey quesadillas. I'm a sucker for anything made in house- sign me up! She also guided me away from the pork and told me to get the chicken because it was better. I love having an interaction with someone who actually knows what they're talking about, so much better than a doe-eyed or aloof server saying \"everything is good\".   When my plate arrived, I was really impressed with the presentation. The quesadilla took up half the plate, it was drizzled with crema, sprinkled with queso fresco, fresh cilantro and diced onion. It was served with a side of shredded iceberg and some lime wedges. I'm a firm believer in meaningful condiments, so if it comes with wedges dammit I'm using all of them.   I juiced the limes and went to town. The steaming hot shredded chicken was perfectly cooked, sauteed with onions, spices and dressed with just the right amount of red chili. Slight warning- this is a little spicy but I would rate it close to a Valentino or Cholula-level.   Coworker #1 got the Asada plate; the meat was bland and the beans were a little too creamy for my liking.  I quickly apologized to my quesadilla for straying.  Coworker #2 is a fellow foodie and had the shrimp tacos.  She was protecting her plate like a mother bear over a cub so I knew better and thought, \"next time\".   I've since been back and tried desperately to look at something else on the menu but the chicken quesadilla Estilo del Rey kept beckoning to me.  Soon my love, we will reunite...  oh- and the suit got mad street cred..."}
{"text":"Food was ok not great. Service was slow. We got seated then 2 others got seated a few minutes after. They got their drinks and food before we got asked what to drink.  I will stick to getting my tortas where I've been going plus it's not as pricey as this place."}
{"text":"Very good and very authentic. I had the same torta Adam had on show Man vs. Food, I think it had the whole kitchen in it! But it was really and I could only finish half the torta."}
{"text":"Just needs a little salt but I love the carne asada here. Its very traditional Mexico city food. The only down side is they dont have a liquor or beer and wine licence. They make amazing aqua frescas my favorite is the bomba con jugo!!"}
{"text":"Best Tortas & mexican food in the state hands down, NOTHING comes close! Now I am hungry!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and pretty timely for a busy Friday night.  The food was delicious.  A mountain of meats, spices, Veges, and yumminess.  So filling even having split the el Rey.  The mango crema drink may have added a bit to the fullness effect.  My 13 yo daughter asked why all the waitresses were so pretty.  \"it's their thing\"... They run a swift machine and they do it well"}
{"text":"If I can give a 0 star I will !!!!!! I order a Tostada of ceviche there for 6,45 dollar a combo an they only gave me this !!!!! Never go back here !!!! Never order a tostada of ceviche !!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, filling, fresh. I just wish they had a bigger place it is always so packed of people. Love their carne asada tortas, Their grilled chicken tortas, and their cevizhe tostadas. Good place to go to. Definitely gotta make time for it though."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Food that has great taste and a great price.  We work about 2 miles from this place and it is always the choice for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  Try the Del Rey Torta.  It's like having breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the same time."}
{"text":"Los Reyes De La Torta is a restaurant I heard about from watching Man Vs Food. I saw the host eat a \"Torta del Rey\" and I thought to myself \"That is something I NEED to try\". For those who are not familiar with the torta, it is a like a sandwich in the sense that it is meats and veggies in between two breads. The bread is referred to in spanish as a \"telera\" which is a wide and long bread. The torta del rey is stuffed with beans, pork, breaded steak, ham, an egg, a wiener, chorizo, monterey jack cheese, avocado, onion, tomato and a salsa that is spicy. I had to take the torta to go and I had to eat it about 30 minutes after I ordered it but it was still very tasty. The only downside is that by the time I ate it, the bread was already soggy as you would expect with all the ingredients but it was well worth it. The torta came with an order of fries but they were not that good, hell, even if they were good, I still wouldn't have been able to finish them as I was only able to eat half of the torta before I got full.   As for the restaurant, there was nothing to really scream about. The restaurant was plain and had no booths or anything, just a bunch of table spread out around the place. The menus were in all spanish and the person who took my order spoke to me in spanish so you may have a language barrier when you go to this location. I also did not see any fountain drinks at the restaurant, all I saw was a fridge that had cans and bottles of soda. When I did ask for soda, I was served a can of Coke.   I gave the restaurant 4 stars for the flavor of the torta alone. If you are someone like me who carries a \"spare tire\" around your midsection, try the torta out, you will love it. As a coworker of mine once said \"Live life....... to its fattest\" :)"}
{"text":"Being from Oklahoma, I've had plenty of \"Mexican\" food. There's some amazing tex mex, but as far as authentic Mexican places and taquerias go, it's like you have to know a guy who knows a guy. It's not always easy to find a good one.  Searching for Mexican on Yelp while here from out of town, I see Los Reyes De La Torta is near the top of the list. One look at the menu prices and the photos of the Torta Del Rey, and me and the lady knew we had to check it out.  Of course we both got aguas frescas; I got the mango and she got the strawberry esquimos. Both were served in huge glasses with fresh fruit, hers was good enough she had to have a second.  I had to try the Torta Del Rey and see what all the fuss was about and it was worth it. It came packed with layer upon layer of delicious meat: some kind of breaded beef, pork, some scrambled eggs wrapped around hot dogs, cheese, avocado, and a bit of refried beans.. oh man. It was so good my lady stole half my plate! Not cool!   I got her back by munching on her peluche, essentially a mix of the meats inside the Torta Del rey, but sautéed with onions, peppers, jalapeños and pineapple. Delicious, but we both agreed not as good as the torta.   Altogether it was an extremely filling and tasty experience. There are really exciting and uniquely Mexican flavors in the food here, and Los Reyes De La Torta call themselves the kings for a reason. This place is special."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and the food is always delicious. Awesome tortas and they are huge! I usually take half the sandwich home and eat it for dinner. The servers are friendly and the ambiance is nice and casual. Try the watermelon drink!"}
{"text":"Some of the Best authentic Mexican food I've experienced! They don't serve alcohol but the have a bunch of great blended drink! Very Family friendly restaurant!  Go! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place. I had no idea that it was on that show with that chubby guy who eats way too much. The owners are sure proud of this. I had the Torta Cubana which was delicious. The 2nd best Cuban sandwich I have ever eaten. The best one is at Cocina Express in Rocky Point but I digress. Parking lot is terrible and inside was packed.   Enjoyable except for the two Chicago assholes sitting next to me who bitched the entire time about how everything in Chicago is better than Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food is delicious their pina coladas are amazing. The guy from man vs food dined there and they made a torta after him. They have been opened for year now and it doesn't seem they will close any time soon. They have many different plates at different prices the chorizo and nopales chalupas is my favorite plate. Enjoy the food"}
{"text":"I will never come here or any other reyes de la torta i drove 30 mins to here just to be told i couldn't dine in. i got here at 8:50 and they didnt want to seat me down they were only doing togo, Which is stupid!"}
{"text":"This food is delicious & the service is excellent! I've been coming to this place for several months now & they never disappoint. They serve menudo on the weekends & every friend I have recommended to go there has enjoyed it. Just wish they would buy a liquor license but the virgin drinks are still good. (:"}
{"text":"Man does this place live up to its name! My Torta was da bomb! The portions are huge, so come with an appetite. It's definitely worth the drive if you're not in the area. The fact that it was featured on Man V Food also adds a nice novelty factor to coming here."}
{"text":"Their tacos hawaiianos is superb but sad tosay they have 3-4 pcs of pineapple tidbits....their michelada is fantastic.i was looking for a diablito or mangoniada but they aren't serving"}
{"text":"I will admit the last time I was here a few years ago I was VERY disappointed!  This places was on DDD and i ordered the torta with high hopes.   Turns out, they are just not for me.    However, my SIL asked us to meet them here two nights ago and I am so glad they convinced us to go!    The cameron burro is insanely delicious!  Chipotle crema, prefectly prepared tortillas, so much yum.    I ordered a fancy drink (I think this is a dry restaurant?) and it too me to the beach without the booze! Get the King piña colada, you gotta try it.  My husband ordered the king tacos (with steak) and he loved them.  SIL ordered the same as me, and her husband got another cameron dish that he really enjoyed.    We also got 4 ceviche orders to start and they were really tasty.   They are individual sized and a great way to begin your meal.    If you enjoy Tortas I'm still surr this is the place for you!  They just aren't my cup of tea apparently.  I've now learned that LRdlT can serve up delicious food no matter what you're looking for in a hole in the wall Mexican joint.  One last note:  this place is kid friendly too. Server was attentive and made it fun for him."}
{"text":"The first time, the food was really good. This time the food was very bland and unsatisfying, and my entire order was wrong after repeating myself 3x. Never again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  Well...I've only tried their torts and they're yum! Our waitress was on point today. She kept our drinks full at all times, she brought our food quick. They dont serve chips and salsa but u can buy that seperate. Their portions are good size. Good price. No wait time this evening,  depending the time u go (I.e. lunch, early dinner or Saturday evening) they may have a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"First time here.  Receive wrong food. The check is handwritten can't tell what you are being charged for. The corn quesidalla be careful with  add on will more than double in Price. Food was dry. We received the wrong food at first. It was an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  Went here after licking my lips watching this place on an old Man vs Food Episode.  I sank my teeth into the Torta Del Rey and washed it down with the Watermelon Fresca.  The food was hot, fresh, and tasty.  The fresca was so perfectly refreshing.  Can't wait to go back here again in the future."}
{"text":"Watermelon Agua Fresca was absolutely delicious and the three tortas we shared at the table did not disappoint! Especially when smothered with the salsa they serve. The food was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious.   Only reason for the 4 stars is location (way the hell out there in phoenix, wish it was closer!) and atmosphere. The main room is nice with the kitchen visible but the added on room is apparently where the place all the babies and three 20-somethings?   But I definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"WIN It was quite wonderful. The dejected look on my friends face was priceless when they brought out the salsa with no chips. It would have been nice to have but the shrimp quesadilla made up for it. The mango smoothie I had was a little closer to room temp than I preferred but, I'll be back for sure. The burrito gracing the cover of Phoenix magazine is calling me."}
{"text":"The signature Torta Norteña is the bomb! A cross between a Hamburger & Roast Beef Sandwich, this tasty Mexican style sandwich has grilled steak, grilled onions, jalapenos, cheese, avocado and a mayo chipotle sauce.   If you like Mexican food you'll love Los Reyes de la Torta, as long as you are totally (Seriously) down with hole in the wall places in the hood?"}
{"text":"I'm starting to have some withdrawal syndrome of true authentic Mexican food.  Since I saw on Man vs Food los Reyes de la Torta and I drive by at least 3 days a week, I decided to give it a try.  I got by fix to-go so I don't know about the dine-in experience, although while I was waiting the air got a little thick from the cooking.  I tried the Hawaiian torta, the pambazo and the milanesa (breaded steak).  The Hawaiian was pretty good although the pork element was a little overwhelming. A little off from the Mexican pierna.  The pambazo was too moist and the \"papas con chorizo\" got lost in the other (mediocre) flavors. I would like a kick of chorizo flavor with cubed potatoes, less salsa in the bun, and less lettuce. This was disappointing for me.  The best part, the milanesa torta. It, on its own gets the 4 stars for this place. Tasteful, nice portion (could feed 2 or 3), ripe avocado, jalapenos, nothing not to love of this torta.  It's good to have something from the Mexican kitchen that it's not tacos!"}
{"text":"This places was great we had the torta and some street tacos.  It was great would go back again."}
{"text":"Many many torta options and all seem quite big.  The place is in a small plaza and the place looks kind of ghetto.  I'm not into many Mexican foods, but I do like some tortas and tostadas, etc.  I ordered the Del Rey, so I could get a taste of one of their popular choices.  The order came with chips, which weren't that crispy, but the sandwich itself was probably worth the money already.  I think I would've enjoyed it more if I didn't try to finish it all at once, but I didn't have a microwave in my hotel room and didn't want it to go to waste.  I think half of the sandwich would have been enough already.  So make sure to come when you're really hungry.   The ham was a little on the drier side, but the cheese wrapped with the sausage and the beef was really good.  But I think it's better to share it with someone!"}
{"text":"Fun idea.  Crazy interesting combinations thrown on bread.   We went after seeing on Man VS Food but I was less than blown away.   I think you should go, just don't plan on having the best quality food of your life.   The overall experience was fun."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I must say each visit is as good as the last. The tortas are probably the best I've had in Phoenix(dare you to find better),they are pretty nice size, so be prepared to eat. Oh, yea lunch time gets crazy but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Had the Torta del Rey and could only eat half of it.  This was one huge sandwich and all the ingredients really worked well together.  I'm saddened that this place is such a long drive away for me.  And when I'm in that general area I have to choose between Los Reyes and Chino Bandito."}
{"text":"I'm closer to the 7th street location but I will go out of my way to get a tastier experience & better service. This location now has a matching menu & they actually serve chips & salsa. The salsa is 5 stars on its own. The juices are better here too, watermelon is my favorite."}
{"text":"Outside of Mexico City and my parents' kitchen, the best torta I've ever had! Classic flavors and paired with a delicious licuado de platano y chocolate. The best!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. We were looking for taco Tuesday specials and decided to give this place a try. When we arrived, it wasn't as busy so no waiting. The service was good. We ordered Pierna torta, Ranchera de Res, asada tacos and pollo tacos. Everything was delicious! We also ordered a pineapple fresca and strawberry fresa. The fresa was the best dessert I've ever had! Not too sweet which is what I liked and well worth the $5 it cost. I would definitely come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Every time I drive by this place, I get a little thrill down my spine. MMMM!  Where else can you go to experience a bit of heaven between two soft pieces of bread?  I met Mr. Hottie and Foodie Bear for lunch one afternoon at Los Reyes. I will say that I'm not a HUGE fan of sandwiches, but when it's free, what the heck? I walked in to the strip mall establishment and was met by the aroma of grilled onions and meat! So far, so good!  Once seated, I found my eyes wandering around the menu and wishing I could eat everything on it!  After sipping on a delicious horchata, and pondering the menu, I decided on the Torta el Rey which means \"torta that has everything but the kitchen sink in it\" (loosely translated)! This AMAZING sammie came with breaded thin beef steak, ham, chorizo, fried egg, cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and jalapeno! This is CERTAINLY not something you want to feed a family member who is at risk of kicking the bucket due to heart or kidney issues. Consider yourself warned. I will say that if you eat this sandwich, you are bound to fall in love with it. It's a dangerous, forbidden love, but a love you will cherish nonetheless.  One of the issues I have with sandwiches is the bread. In previous experience, the tortas that I ate had terribly boring bread, or bread that was way too hard. Los Reyes' bread was yummy! It was grilled and and crusty, but not so crusty that you cut your mouth or it's too hard. The ingredients of the torta were all well made and delicious. Everything was HOT where it needed to be and cold and fresh where that needed to be! Perfecto!  So why is that 5th star missing? I want to head back to try another torta to be sure of a 5 star rating!  Looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Don't get the hype. A Man vs. Food challenge obviously gave this place loads of attention, which is why we tried it.   Good stuff overall, but didn't meet the hype for me."}
{"text":"If there were only 5 Mexican Restaurants I could eat in Phoenix.  I would put Marisco's Playa Hermosa number 1, and Los Reyes prolly 4th or 5th.   This place is good.  They have a variety of Torta's and a others such as tacos, burritos, etc.  My girlfriend and I shared the Torta Del Rey and some other dish she ordered.  Overall pretty good, I would come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Walking into the place was like walking into a little bit of Mexico. Mexican pop salsa music was quietly playing and the TVs were turned to Fox deportes channel. The cushions were Naugahyde and the table tops were clean but with a thin film of stickiness. Probably grease. Loved it. Nice, pleasant, unpretentious surroundings and people. Hope you're hungry. Big big portions that should satisfy the biggest eaters. Not expensive. Large menu. Bewildering if you don't know Mexican cuisine. Authentic. I've never tasted prickly pear before. Lots of cheeses in our meals so watch out lactose intolerants. Interesting flavors and textures. Will definitely come back when I want to feel like I'm briefly visiting Mexico for a meal."}
{"text":"I recently visited Los Reyes de la Torta.  This was my second visit, which was definitely disappointing compared to the first.  The aguas here are DELISH!! They make a great summer drink, especially in this AZ heat.  I had the agua de sandia (watermelon), and my boyfriend tried the agua de fresa (strawberry) cremosa.  For the cremosa drinks they mix it with Carnation and sweet cream, and I have to say this is one of the thickest ones I've had before.  We ordered the queso fundido with jalapenos which I was really looking forward to.  However, this was a huge disappointment.  The waitress placed the plate down and I noticed that they served it with tortillas rather than tortilla chips.  I grabbed a piece of the tortilla, and went to scoop up some gooey queso fundido...except it wasn't gooey.  It was a gelatinous, almost solid bowl of cheese.  This didn't seem right to me.  We asked the waitress to warm it up some more, but it came back the same.  After asking her about it, she said they don't serve your traditional queso fundido.  They use mozzarella cheese which doesn't really melt to well...For dinner I had an order of the coctel de camaron (shrimp cocktail).  They are very generous with the shrimp.  Actually that's all that was really in there.  I would have preferred a little more avocado and  to have some cucumber in there was well.  I wouldn't mind giving this place another shot, especially for their awesome aguas."}
{"text":"This place is one of our go-to favorite places. Their ceviche tostadas are so good. We get them every time. They have great tortas, although we are not a fan of the hot dog ones (Could be personal preference). Their burro de camaron is also one of my favorites. I really feel like 98% of the menu is delicious. We love that they always have Mexican music on in the background. and my husband LOVES that there is always a soccer game on TV. It's a bit sketchy when you drive & walk up, but it really is an awesome place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! And all the staff were friendly! I loved the king mushroom tacos, rice, beans, and guac. My boyfriend loved his pambaza and the chilaquiles. Even though we're in Pheonix for a short time we are definitely coming back for more :)"}
{"text":"Honestamente, lugar no está muy bueno. las meseras muy malas. desde cuando ando esperando para que me den una horchata... llevo 10.min esperando y la mesera ni se aparece. las tortas no están tan buenas... no volveré."}
{"text":"Faithful customer for years, now. I have been visiting Phoenix from OC quite often for business as photographer and visiting friends. Just like I can't imagine not visiting In'N'Out burger joint when back home, I cannot skip my Torta sandwich in Phoenix. Check them out!"}
{"text":"My cousin has been talking about this place for years never get a chance to go by here even though I  Even though I drive by here all the time I must say  Wish I went sooner  Really  good aguas  and the best   quesadilla mushroom onions and a bunch of other veggies cook crispy tortilla the all the people were friendly  Definitely a new place to go I will be back very soon"}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Service was excellent.  Tried one of the mini-tortas.  Will definitely go back to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"What a great \"find\". I must have driven by Los Reyes hundreds of times and never set foot inside. My loss until now. The restaurant is simple and straightforward. No alcohol, but let me tell you: the lemonade is awesome so no complaints about not having a margarita with the meal. This family-owned business is all about the food and the attentive and friendly service.   Once seated we ordered some refreshments and, after deciding on our order it wasn't even 5 minutes before they arrived; and the portions were, lets say, generous. Wow. I ordered the Torta del Rey. It's huge. And really delicious. Layers of assorted meats including bacon. Truthfully, I would have had enough with just one half and saving the other for lunch the next day. The price is more than reasonable given the size of the portions. This place is an amazing value for what you get and you will not be disappointed. Check it out. I definitely will return."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my handsome Mexican fiance, and he was totally impressed with the authenticity of the food and drink! I was equally impressed with the selection and deliciousness! Tons of fresh produce to accompany the filling, meaty dishes! Great balance! Great service! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"So flippin good.  Went here after a Camelback hike on no food and not enough water.    Tried the pineapple agua fresca: delivered to the table quickly, tasted fresh, and was oh so good after a hike.  torta norteña de pollo: demolished this sandwich. The jalapeños and avacado complemented the sandwich perfectly.  If I lived in Pheonix, I'd visit regularly."}
{"text":"Come hungry because the tortas are huge and you will want to eat every bite. I have only been once and I ate the Torta Nortena de pollo. It was soo good. I definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"The first time we ate here i was super excited after seeing this restaurant on Man Vs. Food.  It was very easy to find although there is limited parking.  We were seated right away.  I ordered the Nortena Torta which was filled with Japapenos! Yum.  It was everything i was expecting.  You have your choice of a salad or chips.  My husband ordered the Del Rey which was enormous!  He really liked it as well.  I had a Coca Cola from Mexico out of a bottle which reminded me of eating in Mexico City with my family, although there are no refills.  The waitresses  are very attentive.    The second time we came in we had a great experience as well, but did not really like their Arnold Palmer because it seems that the iced tea is not brewed but a powder drink.  So we sent it back and ordered water instead which they made no big deal out of.  They offer so many different plates and choices. I can't wait to try something new every time i come in.  I can't wait to bring my family here when they come visit."}
{"text":"When i lived in Arizona, i always traveled to their North Phoenix location.  Recently i was in Tempe and realized they opened one there.  The food was just as good and i was so happy to have my favorite Torta the Nortena Steak Torta! I can't wait to visit again when i'm in town."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I can ever remember eating. However, my stomach didn't feel right the next day. My friends that ate with me said the same thing. It felt a little bit like a cafateria inside but nobody seem to care because the food was so freaking good!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in the valley to grab a Mexican sandwich  I ordered the Arizona $8.99 served in with ham melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef,egg omelette and potatoe Ruffles chips on the side."}
{"text":"This is what Torta perfection is all about.  Wide range of styles and proteins, freshest ingredients, real telera bread and a passion for delivering mouth watering goodness every single time tattooed on the culture of the establishment.   I've tried the Cubana, the Milanesa de Pollo and the Nortena de Pollo.  While all clearly above the rest, the one that really stands out is the Nortena.  A harmonious blend of grilled chicken, slightly charred, loaded with melted cheese, tomatoes, avocados, refried beans, chipotle AND jalapeños.  I couldn't just eat one... I had two.  They have regular size (which is really Xtra Large) and Minis (which are regular for everyone else).   Attentive and friendly service.  Stand out appetizers include the Tostada de Ceviche as well as the Tostada de Tinga.   Buen provecho!  Eating here is like being in a year round Torta-pallozza!  I love it."}
{"text":"I was PUMPED to try this place because the food looks so good in the pictures! My experience ended up being just okay, but I'm willing to go back to try other dishes if I'm in the area.  Upon first walking in, there definitely was that faint sulphur-like, sewery smell that was mentioned in a few older reviews. Definitely not a super appetizing way to start off! I braved the slight stench and decided to order anyway, hoping the food would make up for it.   I got the shrimp ceviche and iconic del Rey torta. The ceviche looked good but lacked flavor, and the torta gave me strong hotdog flavor vibes that I couldn't shake off.   I have high hopes the beautiful looking quesadillas can be their saving grace for me so I will be back to try those.   For now, Los Reyes is a hard pass for my torta needs!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the pork was a little dry on the Del Ray. I would like to try something else next time."}
{"text":"Good food but they need to invest in a better exhaust system. It is too smoky in there. They could also relax for a bit. They try and rush you out of there."}
{"text":"Once you have tasted the melt in your mouth perfect tortas here you will never be satisfied anywhere else. I think about this place every time I see a torta on the menu back home but I know not to order it, until one day I travel back to Phoenix from NYC..."}
{"text":"Best place to get a torta!! Their ceviche tostadas are also really, really fresh and yummy! I highly recommend for authentic Mexico City style food."}
{"text":"Come here, and you won't need to eat anything for the rest of the day. Seriously. I had my torta around 1 pm, it's 10 pm now, and I am not even close to hungry,   This is the place you may have seen in the Food Netowork's \"Man vs. Food.\" I didn't get the monstrosity of a torta featured on the show but instead opted for the El Rey, the first one on the menu.   Whoah. This thing was HUGE. And stuffed with every imaginable sort of deliciousness, from breaded beef,  sausages and ham to fried egg, cheese, avocado and a delectable spicy chipotle mayo sauce.   The perfect lunch for a 110-degree August day in Phoenix. OK, not really-- I felt like I was going to faint a couple of times. But I soldiered on, and was able to (almost) finish the whole thing with the help of copious amounts of ice water.   Oh, it's also worth mentioning that whoever owns this place does not hire anything but the cutest Hispanic girls, all with their hair tied up in perky pony tails.   And like most other cheap eateries in Phoenix, you can make it out the door for under 10 bucks and stuffed fuller than a Tokyo subway train.   Can't wait to get back to the \"Torta Kings!\""}
{"text":"I grew up in central Mexico and Los Reyes de la torta has exactly the same amazing food you would find there. The menu has great diversity for food and drinks! Definitely one pf the very few places in the valley where you can eat real Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Loved it. I had a torta and mango agua cremosa delicious. We were stuffed. Service was pretty good and friendly the environment they've created is quite cozy. Overall I loved it an will be back again. Kudos!  PS: My aunt is from Mexico City and coming here reminded me of her food."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food! Salsa is no joke! Excellent service, I will be returning!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! Hands down best and authentic Mexican Food that I have yet to see in Los Angeles!! I can't wait to come back!! Try their house made juices! I had Chilaquilles!!!"}
{"text":"This place food is amazing. My brought me here last Thursday.  I have been wanting to try this place but never went, and totally should have gone sooner. Love the place. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is cause I saw a seat cushion ripped. But other then that the place looks good."}
{"text":"Finally decided to check this spot out and they did not dissapoint! I got the Torta el Rey that basicaly had everything you could fit on a killer toasted talera roll. It had pork, hotdog, beef, ham, cheese, avocado, tomatoes and probably a few hundred other things. The sandwich was around $8 and WELL worth it. I can't wait to go back and try a more \"normal \" torta, but I\"m alllll in"}
{"text":"Started us off with complimentary chips and salsa, which is always a plus. Felt I needed to get one of the tortas, since it was our first time here. Went with the Nortena de res, as recommended by our server. Did not disappoint! I could only finish half, as the portions are quite big and not to mention we indulged in two rounds of chips. Boyfriend got the chicken enchiladas, and those were awesome as well. We got a side of beans and those were very delicious. Super friendly staff!   Came back and got the king tacos--awesome!"}
{"text":"I've ordered food to go from here several times and have never been disappointed in the least! The food is fantastic, especially the shrimp burrito, my personal fave. I've had the veggie burro too and that was pretty good. The staff is ok. Some of them are really nice but there are a few that are kinda shitty. Ignore them, just eat :)   I love the grilled onion, lime, radishes, etc. that they add as a garnish. I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food! Will be coming back for sure. I tried the ceviche this time and it was fantastic. This place will not disappoint. The service is always great!"}
{"text":"We used to come here to Los Reyes De La Totra weekly. We all enjoyed the food. And one of my friends was a picky eater and he liked it here a lot. My friends always ordered various meat dishes tacos and enchiladas and one would get the steak. Everyone was satisfied and. Finished their meal with a smile. I would order the sopes usually 2. I would get mines vegan. Hmm they were ok. Not outstanding and not terrible either. The reason I was not loving them was because they didn't put hardly any thing on them............ Just beans and lettuce. Would have been more enjoyable if they gave them some love. Tomatoes, avocados, chillies. But no just lettuce and beans .  At least the flavour was good (hand made fresh) not deep fried. Then after going there for several months; they revamped the menu and it included a plate for vegetarians. Which included nopales, beans and I think also a tostada. And I would at times order this and at times get my sopes.  Ahh before I forget...these sopes were not your traditional  small tea cup plate size.......no no;  they were big about the size of a small dinner plate. Also they didn't have the folded in edge like a traditional sope has. These were flat and thick.   Salsas were always good. And if you needed more they would bring you more no charge ah they serve corn chips and salsa no charge. Which is a nice touch especially if your hungry. Gives you some thing to munch on before you get your meal.  All the staff here at Los  Reyes De La Totra. Were all always very friendly, personable and helpful. This is one place I sincerly do miss."}
{"text":"Been here several times over the last few years for both lunch and dinner. Kids love it as much as I do. Food is great, reasonably priced and the agua fresca are wonderful."}
{"text":"Delicious! Waiting too long to try this place. I could've been spending my money on tortas here ALL THIS TIME!! I ordered a chicken torta and requested the tinga-style chicken. Freakin amazing, fresh and light choice for this hotter-than-hell Phoenix summer. I'll be returning soon to try other great priced, creative dishes here."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I never write reviews on anything; however, this establishment deserves the recognition. From the welcoming presence, to the friendly and efficient service, to the quality of food, cleanliness of the restaurant, the inviting atmosphere, and prices are all terrific...  My fiancé and I decided to give Los Reyes a try a little over a month ago. The parking lot didn't look very busy, but as we entered the restaurant we were pleasantly surprised to find that it was packed with predominantly Hispanic patrons (always a good sign in a Mexican restaurant). Everyone appeared to be having a good experience at each table as we walked by; which, set the tone.   As we were being seated, we noticed servers walking by with trays of food, all the dishes had beautiful presentation. There was authentic Mexican music playing, informative and friendly staff to match. As we opened the menus, we noticed that Los Reyes was featured on Man vs. Food; which, was also another good sign.   Tony was our server, who came over promptly, welcomed us, then gave us the run down of house favorites and what Los Reyes is best known for. He was very accommodating, social and aware of our needs. Great service from him and all who we had interface with each time. Tony shared the history of the restaurant and expressed his gratitude for being a part of the family.   The food is extremely flavorful authentic style Mexican from (Mexico City) with perfect portions and affordably priced. We thoroughly enjoyed our time from start to finish and kept observing how well we felt we were taken care of there. I can't speak highly enough about our experiences here! We've visited four times in the last month and a half and will definitely return. The place is impeccable!"}
{"text":"I really like Mexican food, and its good here.  I very much enjoyed my chorizo burrito.  It was just right.  Beans, cheese, chorizo, and guacamole were in perfect ratio.  Ingredients were distributed throughout the burrito and not just clumped on there.  Nothing worse than taking a bite of your burrito and getting a mouthful of just guacamole! And none in the rest.  Yuck.  Not here, they know how to fix it right.  If I had to make a criticism, it would be the tough tortilla.  It was kind of difficult to cut-- but to their credit, they did provide a knife.  If you pick it up and eat it, stuff might squirt out and go everywhere when you bite through it.  I also enjoyed my husband's carne asada taco (I stole one off his plate).  Plenty of lime and yummy caramelized onion on the side.  Its worth a visit for sure."}
{"text":"Went there a couple weeks ago.    Nice place.   Waiter extremely nice.  Food was good.  Big tortas.  I didnt order anything to drink other then water but the drinks that went to other tables looked awsome.   I would go again"}
{"text":"The Torta de Milanesa was good. Not the best, but decent. I also had a bite of my friends Torta Cubana and that was good, slightly better than my milanesa. My torta de milanesa had beans and no-where else have I ever had beans in a torta, atleast never in Mexico, place where the torta is king. But this might just be a filling replacing the standard avocado added to tortas de milanesa. Since I noticed that my torta lacked that and the avocado always gives it that extra creamy and tasty kick!!          Also, my standards are high for tortas. I've been lucky enough to enjoy tortas de Milanesa and Cubanas in Currnavaca and Mexico City by Tortas Che and others there!! Those are bomb!!! ANYWAYS!!          The tortas here are not bad, their simply good, but nothing that I would frequent nor crave. The service here was fantastic!!!! No complaints there, we were getting attention left and right, nothing overwhelming, just accommodating and super attentive.         The ONE THING I did love from this place was the Fresas con Crema!! Those were AMAZING!!! That is the reason why I came here in the first place. One of my friends had these exact Fresas con Crema at his place and he shared some with me to try and the Fresas con Crema and I fell in love ever since!!  OH YOU SWEET, SWEET, FRESAS CON CREMA with pieces of pecans!! :) You rock my taste buds!! :)       Yours truly,            Lizeth M. :)"}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Yum!  Like everyone else I came here because of man vs. food and the great ratings on yelp.  This place is for sure a \"hole-in-the-wall\" joint, but at the end of the day what matters is the food.  I found the food to be extremely unique with fatty ingredients, but surprisingly not \"fatty\" tasting.  In all reality these sandwiches are HUGE.  I personally ate half of a half of the famous torta and some chicken quesadilla and I was done until the morning.  The aqua fresca was also right on point.  I had the pina one and it was delicious.    To sum it up, I really liked this place.  I plan on going back to try some of the great looking mexican food they have.  We didn't have to wait and the service was just fine.  Give this place a try... it is worth it for the experience alone, but the food doesn't hurt - that's for sure."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful, shrimp grilled to my liking, and staff very friendly and welcoming.  Will be back soon i promise :)"}
{"text":"Serious amazing food!!! Everything was super fresh and delicious...I've never had Mexican food like it! Heads up though...they do not serve alcohol, but regardless their list of agua frescas is amazing and all made with fresh fruit."}
{"text":"Love love love Tortas!! Amazing food, truly delicious and authentic! A must try! Staff is always friendly and food is consistently wonderful!"}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious. The service is great, the food is fantastic, casual and fun atmosphere. We love coming here. Their chips and salsa are addicting, all the tortas are incredible, the tacos are bomb, and it's all very reasonably priced. Our tab for the two of us is typically around $20, which is honestly a steal for the portion sizes and how great the food is."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and absolutely delicious!  Tonight we stopped in to have valentine's dinner they had the place decorated with lotts of love for Valentine's day. Our waitress Alondra was very quick kind and professional. Every few minutes she constantly asked if we needed anything and that to us is very important. I enjoyed the cheese enchiladas with rice and had to order beans on the side.  It was prepared differently than most mexican food places. It had mozzarella cheese inside on top it had lettice, avocado, mexican cheese and sour cream topped with home made  green verde salsa. I can tell it wasn't a frozen food its authentic.  They also have a very large selection of natural fruit drinks check out my photos of what drinks they have. Especially if your pregnant they have alot of delicious healthy drinks. Im definitely coming back to this place love the great customer service and how they make the food makes me wonder if this is how  people in Mexico prepare their food because its slightly different than filibertos, ponchos and so on. The restaurant is very clean and  nice."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing, breakfast, lunch or dinner; doesn't matter what time you come it's always great!!!"}
{"text":"Unbelieveable hands down the best most unique mexican cuisine that has greaced Phoenix.  These folks know what they are doing. Out of this world flavor, super WOW quantities of amazing flovor packedwith thoughtful combinations of bursting goodness.  This place is the mecca of mexician. get there."}
{"text":"I've tried ceviche at numerous restaurants, some overly priced! Reyes by far have the BEST ceviche I've tasted. Everything about it is perfect. Their tacos are awesome as well. I personally don't care for tortas because it's too big and too much meat for me but my friends all love it. Service is fast, staff is über friendly, reasonably priced, a very casual place to take your family."}
{"text":"Stopped at this place(on southern in Tempe) as a coworker of mine was highly suggesting this was the BEST place to get carne asada tacos. Traveled from Tucson and met family here. The place was clean and the staff was inviting and friendly. Service was good, Horchata was Bueno and homemade tasting. Shrimp was really good. But the Carne asada tacos were not the good I was expecting... They were bland, beans were freshly cold from a can and bland, rice had no flavor and no color and the bistek had no flavor.   I love customer service so I gave the place a 3 star. Maybe I visited on an off day and will give it another try, another time."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd time eating here (we traveled all the way from Texas on two separate occasions!) and the food is still as awesome as I had remembered it! The aguas frescas are great!"}
{"text":"i got the torta del rey. holy moly there was a lot of food in it. If you like meat.. there is every type imaginable in this torta.  my only issue w/ it was that.. i got tired of eating it after the first half. It may be my preference but i felt like someone blended a bunch of meats and i was trying to eat it.   On the positive side.. that quantity of food was only like 6$. I probably could have made 3 meals out of this."}
{"text":"Oh yum, this place, as the other reviewers have raved is great.  Their definitely known for their tortas, but a great find in the pork loin tacos as well.  The server was a little surprised when they saw that I had ordered both those dishes.  I finished them both.  The Mexicana, carne asada torta, had fresh bread, good mix of avocados and sides making this a great mexican sandwich.  The carne asada was good.  The Pierna, pork loin tacos, were moist and just right.  Good amount of toppings and the salsa was a good addition to the street style tacos.  The aguas frescas, I had the papaya drink which was refreshing."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple. We had a couple burritos and chicken tacos. The burritos were good, quite large. But the chef/cook could mix the ingredients a little. Both our burritos had one ingredient on one end and another on the opposite end etc etc. The tacos were piles high with chicken. I have no idea how a person is supposed to eat them with any toppings. There was that much chicken. The restaurant itself is a dive. But ya dont come here for that. Its all about the food. Reasonably priced, especially with a restaurant.com certificate. I will go back soon. I'm anxious to try the tortas."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are very good and so are the tortas. La agua de coco creamosa is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I drove past this place SO MANY times, and just ate there for the first time last weekend. Needles to say, I feel like an ass for not having ate here sooner! The food was amazing, the service was good, and the prices were more than fair. They also have these key lime candies that my boyfriend is addicted too, so that was a nice finish. I look forward to eating here again soon, and hope to try their aqua fresca's"}
{"text":"Just a simple straight forward review here.  Came in around 11 AM by myself for a quick lunch.  Ordered a mini shrimp ceviche tostada and mini torta norteno de res (carne asada).  Tostada came out within minutes and was perfection.  Cold, clean, fresh ceviche which was a perfect snack.  Torta came out piping hot and fresh.  Added some salsa and chopped jalapeños and it was perfection in my opinion.  Just a nice clean spicy torta.  Bill was $9 plus tip.    Highly recommend anytime"}
{"text":"Es uno de los pocos lugares con verdadera comida mexicana en Phoenix.  Comí una torta, bastante grande, tuve que compartirla. Estaba acompañada de una ensalada bastante buena también."}
{"text":"Overpriced and awful. There was more chicken fat and bones in my quesadilla than chicken meat. This is the most overrated restaurant in the valley. Steer clear."}
{"text":"This restaurant is  good ,I had  the mushroom quesadilla it was really tasty. I also got horchata juice,the service was great ,good prices"}
{"text":"You know it's gunna be a good spot.  When you walk in and the aroma of the food cooking makes your mouth water.   Great spot, great people, fantastic food= long time customers!!"}
{"text":"Yes I went here because of Man vs Food.    Got the King Torta.  Not bad.  Tons of stuff going on.  Breaded chicken fried steak, ham, hot dog egg, on a nice tasting Bolillo.    Also have a fantastic salsa that they give you with it.  But heres where I have a problem.  Ruffles chips with it.  WTF?  Weird combo.  Anyway it was a bit overpriced too.   But I guess when you are a celebrity because you were on Man Vs Food, people will show up and pay any damn amount.  I only go when family is in town and they wanna go to that Man Vs Food place, LOL.  I can't afford this place on a regular basis for basic Mexican Sandwiches."}
{"text":"Wow this place is another hole in the wall gem.  this food is as authentic as it gets.  It was recommended to me by a friend that is from Mexico.  Its probably not exactly like they do it there, but I am told its as close as you'll get up here.  The prices are very fair, and the portions are generous.  You might even need to spit it up if you are not a big appetite.  All the food is fresh, and the service was great.  You know that you have hit the right place for authenticity when you are the only gringo in the place, and Spanish language ESPN is on the TV.  You have to try a torta if you go there for the first time.  I mean the name King of Tortas say it all.  I recommend the agua frescas too, as that was such a great combination with the heat of the food.  I have been there a few times, and both the cuban and carne asada were not to disappoint.  There is plenty of seating, and I did not have to wait to be seated on any of my visits."}
{"text":"El platillo de carne asada no se Los recomiendo. Llena de pellejo una cosa en la foto y otra lo que te sirven!!! Y cuando le pregunte a la mesera que si Asi era llena de pellejos dijo si asi la comi yo!!! Fatal la calidad!!!!"}
{"text":"I paid for a full meal and came with just a sandwich no sides or anything they obviously don't take the time to notice either."}
{"text":"I have been here several times now since my original review. The service is still great and fast considering how busy they are. The food is wonderful, I have yet to be disappointed. But I have to mention that my greatest dining pet peeve happens here everytime. When I get my hand written receipt, it never has prices on in, not even the tax. I get a list of my drinks and entrees and a total. I do guestimate every bill and it does seem accurate, but that is super annoying. Their menu does state they autimatically add 15% gratituity for parties of 6 or more. Now, I have never been here with more than 4 people and always tip 30-40%. My point is, how would you know if you are being (double) charged for tipping with a large party unless you happened to see that on the menu. I am sure most don't read the whole menu. I will be back, I hope in the next few days = ). I just wanted to give you all a heads up!!"}
{"text":"We drove all the way from Maricopa to Sunny Slope after my teenage son and his friend saw it on Man vs. Food (duh). They each got the Del Rey which is a huge meat filled sandwich, the same one Adam ate when he was there. My son finished it and thought it was delicious...his friend thought it was just too much meat and didn't finish his.  I had a Beef Nortena which was flavorful and spicy and HUGE!   I forget what our other friend had but she was very happy with it.   The menu was extensive but we didn't really look it over since we knew we were coming for the Tortas (Mexican Sandwiches). Service was great but do not expect the waitresses to speak fluent English.   My kids enjoyed the kids menu too!  It really was a TREAT and if we are ever up that way again it is someplace we would go again!"}
{"text":"Great place for tortas!  I came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon and ordered the Del Rey to go.  The service was great, the price was really good, my meal came out fast, delicious and hot.  The torta was stuffed with all my favorite things and came with two different kinds of sauce and a bunch of ruffles potato chips.  I was pleasantly surprised by this place and would recommend Los Reyes de la Torta if you're looking for a creative, huge meal at a low price."}
{"text":"So, so good. Great enchiladas (oh god the fresh cheese), amazing burros (get the bistec with red sauce), cactus tacos, giant tortas, and more. Don't let the former Denny 's look from outside throw you off. This place is great. Service is friendly and on top of it plus the chips and salsa are delish."}
{"text":"My server was adorable! He was so informative and had so much patience with me. He even told me his favorite in each category and why! I loved it. My chicken nortena torta was pretty good, but the carne asada quesadilla was awesome and even better as leftovers. It was too big too eat all at once. I also like how they served small, inexpensive ceviche tostadas, just to take the edge off while you wait for your entree! Very clean, sweet place!  Also, I have to say, go here before you go next door to spokes. That place is a joke  when it comes to their food."}
{"text":"Intrigued by how busy this place is every-time I drive by.  Decided to order a to-go order for lunch to give it a try. And I have to say, it was pretty damn solid.   Menu is huge, lots to choose from, lots of odd stuff I'm not familiar with. Had a full-size Nortena with chicken. Absolutely kicked ass. Great flavor, great bread, all the veg was fresh. I annihilated the whole thing. Loved the grilled onion and jalapeno it came with. They could leave out the dry cucumber slices on the side, though.   Reasonably priced, and the order was ready to go when I got there.   Will definitely be back, though I doubt I would ever dine-in. Not exactly the nicest atmosphere or area."}
{"text":"Had the Mexican torta. Very good. The beef was excellent and the veggies were fresh. Had some of my friend's seafood quesadilla and that was even better. The portions were large and very filling. I would definitely go back. Great place.  Side note. The area is a little sketchy and some random people were inside selling rosaries and Mexican pastries. But the food was great."}
{"text":"Stop by this place on a recommendation from my 9 yr old daughter who saw this place on man vs food.   We came, we ate, and we're stoked!     I thought coming from San Diego It wouldn't impress me.   But heeeyyyyy,  it did and we were delighted in everything we had.   3 different kind of tortas and an awesome quesadillas.     One thing was weird is the fact they they use ruffles potato chips instead of tortilla chips.    Overall a good place."}
{"text":"Walking in to Reyes was an experience for me. It's a busy little hole in wall in an unsuspecting mini strip mall where you're greeted by a flock of Spanish speaking hostesses. My blank stare must have communicated my intent; I was handed a menu as I was asked \"to-go?\"  Yes, that.   I moved away from Phoenix a few years ago and Austin doesn't have a decent torta place to its name. My usual go-to was on Arizona avenue, but I didn't feel like fighting the 51 this afternoon. So here I come Reyes!  My Arizona torta only took a few minutes to come out and I must have inhaled it back at my hotel. It was packed with meat, tomato, avocado, jalapeño...all the good things in life. I poured on the provided green salsa and went to town. It was 1pm and I didn't eat for the rest of the day. Couldn't! For fear of my stomach bursting. Good, filling, indulgent - everything I need in a torta."}
{"text":"I had to try this place as I'm a huge fan of tortas.  The service was good. I had the torta Del Ray made famous on Man vs Food. It was pretty filling but didn't seem to have much flavor. I would not order it again. The bread was good... so there is potential here.  If I go back, I will try one of their more traditional tortas like the Asada or Alambre. For now, Tortas El Guero remains my favorite torta shop in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I came here a while back with my boyfriend after us seeing it on Man v. Food. He had the Del Rey, but again he doesn't have a bottom to his stomach so it only put a dent in his appetite. I had the torta nortena, I have a semi-tolerance for spicy and this peaked over the edge for me but it was none the less great!  Just a few notes, when we came here on a Sunday night there was no line and parking wasn't bad but I can only imagine if you come at another time because the parking lot and the restaurant is small. And also there is another restaurant with this exact same name so make sure you're going to the right one!"}
{"text":"Really good - Really HUGE sandwiches!! I'm a big dude and I couldn't finish it all! Very good selection, servers were nice too - the only negative was they push these giant margaritas that are pretty pricey yet, no booze! It's in no way a deal breaker but our server did not mention it - we had to ask...  Stop in - you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food. Very large portions. Some of the best ceviche. The quesadilla de maiz with toppings was delicious and enough to serve 2-3."}
{"text":"We came in search of an epic Torta.  My husband ordered the big one which had like 5 different kind of meats on it.  The bread was fresh and crunchy and the sandwiches just melted in your mouth.  the service was fast and friendly!  Don't be alarmed that it is out in the boonies, it is great!"}
{"text":"Best tortas ever! Great customer service every time, great Servers and food! I highly recommended  (:"}
{"text":"The Kings of Torta I say!! The Torta Mexicana is what you want. Thinly cut steak with grilled onions, avocado and big fat Jalapeno right in the middle! The neighbor hood isn't that great after 5pm. I look Mexican so I blend in well like a chameleon. But it isn't until I try to order that my cover is blown and they figure out that I only speak English and Californian - however it does relax the nervous white folk standing around waiting for their take out!!  =))  P.s. Parking lot sucks and isn't well lit but fight your way in! - You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Ate here with the wife and kids for the first time. Wow. We loved it! Nice casual atmosphere inside. My wife and I split a Torta and steak tacos. Both were excellent! My son had fish tacos...out of this world. This is perhaps my new favorite in the whole Phoenix metro area."}
{"text":"Like a lot of people, I went here because it was seen on man vs. food. I was not ready to try the challenge or the sandwich. It looks like too much is going on in it. I had half the torta nortena and torta nortena del polla. They were both satisfying. The salsa provided gave it the right amount of flame. The restaurant has an open kitchen setting. Going to a mexican restaurant, i was set on getting some chips and salsa. To my disbelief, I had noticed plates with ruffles chips on them. Couldn't they just cut some tortillas up and deep fry them?   I'll probably be back to try another torta or some other entree."}
{"text":"Great tasting menudo chilaquiles and tortas !  Had the horchata and mixed juices. Tasty food three thumbs up"}
{"text":"My husband and I are kind of Mexican food snobs -- he grew up in Mexico City and takes grave offense to any kind of bell peppers in his food, which was tough when we lived in Texas.  Because  we've been burned often by Mexican places filling cheese enchiladas with Velveeta and similar atrocities, it's a hard sell to get us to try new Mexican restaurants.  But Man vs. Food (plus several enthusiastic recommendations by our friends) won out, and we had to go to try Los Reyes.  It is amazing!  They have things on the menu I haven't even seen since the last time we visited Mexico City (like alambres) and an amazing selection of food at good prices.  My husband had the milanesa torta; milanesa is one of those foods you think should be easy to make but that can go terribly wrong.  His was perfect, and he had no complaints about anything. They also have an amazing collection of fresh fruit juices, including some of the more unusual mixes like the vampiro.  My sincronizada was terrific.  The service was great, too -- our waitress checked up on us several times, as did the other wait staff.  One word of caution:  the guacamole is really more like just flat out avocado.  It's not bad at all, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  Still, this place definitely exceeded my expectations and we'll absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been living in Phoenix for about two summers and I can confidently say these are the best tortas I've ever had. Although the atmosphere is somewhat loud and the wait can be long during busy hours, the wait is always worth it. The staff is very friendly and you can never go wrong with any of the dishes you pick. If a torta is a mouthful, their quesadillas with handmade tortillas are delectable. I also recommend trying out their aguas cremosas made on the spot. This is one of the few places in the area you can he a delicious, full meal for an affordable price."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many, many, many time.   It never disappoints.   I am purely in love with their tortas and even though their are bit out of my way I do not mind driving when I crave torta.   Service is also great and I love laid back atmosphere.   Food is super filing and super delicious.   When you have your cheating day and want something filling and greasy but yet so good, please go and check them out.   . Muchas Gracias Los Reyes crew!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!  The service is somewhat lacking, but I think that's just the culture and most of their clientele is very happy and comfortable with the level of service provided.  I think we were probably the only white table in the place.  We arrived at 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon.  We didn't think it would be so crowded but it was a 20 minute wait for us. Well worth it.  The place was packed and when we left there was still a line out the door.  Can't wait to go back . . ."}
{"text":"I have only tried this place once. My boyfriend and I saw it on the food network channel DDD so we decided to give it a try. Our food was ok, nothing fabulous but not bad either. There were a lot of flys inside, the beans were very watery, the meat on the torta had good flavor but was missing \"something\". We might give it another try, maybe we didnt order the right thing."}
{"text":"Thanks to this place I am always down for tortas. Deeply in love with la norteña de res. Aaaahhh.   Service is always nice, food gets done quick.   Shrimp ceviche tostadas are on point."}
{"text":"Been on a torta kick lately. Had the Mexicana torta with asada, grilled onions, tomato and avocado. Delicious! With a grilled onion, cucumbers, radishes and lettuce on the side this makes a nice meal. Will definitely be back to try others."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Man vs. Food and thought we'd give it a shot.  Wife had the Cubano torta and I had Alambre con pollo with peppers and cheese.  Both were very tasty. Good thing we ordered the smaller ones, as they were filling for us.  The large ones would have been too much for us lightweights.  For beverage we had two different licuados, similar to a milkshake, but not as thick.  I ordered the pineapple and she ordered the strawberry.  We ended up swapping, as we liked the one the other ordered better.  Very yummy and would go again to try something else."}
{"text":"I came here with my hubby because I was impressed with the tons of great reviews on yelp so I felt like like it was a for sure thing..  I was set on ordering the \" Mexican Shrimp cocktail \" since I had been craving one for a very long time & figured it would be outstanding since this place was featured on Man vs Food. ( I moved here a few years ago so I don't know the hot spots for this item )  I have had MANY mexican shrimp cocktails in my life that were amazing so I didn't even think twice when ordering since its a very easy thing to prepare in comparison with typical Mexican dishes..  Unfortunately I was very disappointed when it arrived. .. its like the cook forgot to put half the amount of shrimp in it!!! It probably had 7 - 8 shrimp in it with barely any avocado either. .it was mostly juice and Pico de Gallo.. ( I ordered the large on too! @ $14+ !!! ) ..VERY SKIMPY!!! I'm not expecting to be over served but I definitely expect a fair amount of shrimp! Out of many many places ive tried this was by far the chinsiest!   The flavor was pretty okay though. .not amazing whatsoever but not bad..It was a very sad night for me since I was really looking forward to finding a place that had great ones.. :(  I highly recommend that people beware of wasting your money on this dish. . On the other hand. ..my husband ordered a combo plate with carne asada tacos , beans and rice and I tried his food and it was delish!   I may give this place another try but definitely not the Mexican shrimp cocktail!!!! I'm on a mission to find a place that knows how to make them the right way and is not chinsey with their portion.  Also....its a restaurant atmosphere,  you are seated and have a waitress,  but NO Chips and salsa brought out to the table :( Definitely another downfall!  I'll go to Arriba's Mexican restaurant or Garcia's when I want great Mexican food! .. the price range is same and you get fresh hot chips with yummy salsa too!"}
{"text":"This is some artery clogging bowel busting goodness. The big, juicy Amber Rose-esque torta del rey will make Yeezy jealous.  Meat, meat, and meat stacked up high. Paired with a cantaloupe aqua de fresca and you have a winner.  I'd only hoped that the chorizo was cooked a little more to a crisp, but with all that stuff piled on it's hard to notice.  Also, it's a mexican joint, no?  How about some tortilla chips instead of ruffles, or am I missing something?  That's like eating my pho w/ spaghetti.  But it's cheap and service is good and worth a stop just to experience the Man v Food tour."}
{"text":"I've really had better tacos at a dive bar on Taco Tuesday.  If you have a chance to go somewhere else, pick another place.  Also it was kind of over priced.  I spent $11.00 on three tacos and a small horchata."}
{"text":"Saw this from Man vs Food and had to try it. I like the mountainous tortas with a long list of ingredients. We came and had about a ~30 minute wait.  I tried the torta del rey, which was a giant sandwich. So many different meats and a decent flavor. I think having so many toppings might be overkill but I like the novelty.  Decent sized place and it looks like it's always busy. I'd like to get the King Carlos torta, just to see it and split it. There were also lots of regular mexican foods on the menu that I'd like to try, but I had to get the famous tortas for my first time."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to get an Authentic Mexican Torta. My personal favorite is the \"Torta Del Rey\". Delicious fresh ingredients. Great service and you it's priced for what it's worth. A must try in my checklist. I have recommended this place to several friends with no regrets."}
{"text":"We had the cheese crisp for appetizer. Hubby and I both got deep fried burrito w enchilada sauce. It was excellent quality. Friendly staff! I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Traveling thru Phoenix, wanted some food, but not a chain. Yelp recommended. LOVED IT! Neighborhood joint. Local. Tortas. Sinfully delicious. Generous portions. Reasonably priced. ESPN Desportes (MNF) on the screen. Couldn't AI for more."}
{"text":"My husband's co worker in Los Angeles recommended this place knowing we would be visiting Arizona ...it was totally worth the trip! We each had a torta, Amazing!! Also had one of their creamy fruit drinks banana flavor Wow! I would definitely recommend. This is super casual you go here for the food... No alcohol... so what get a drink some place else."}
{"text":"I'm pissed. Now that Man vs. Food has shown my favorite little hole-in-the-wall spot to the world, word is officially out!  I've actually had to -gasp!- wait for a table. Twice. Ugh. ;)  Seriously though - how could someone not love Los Reyes?  They have prompt, courteous service and the food is awesome.  Portions are large, and we always end up with food for the next day.  I love that the waitresses always remember to put extra salsa in the take-out bag.  It is some tasty stuff!  Favorites of ours include:  Mexicana Torta Chicken Tinga Quesadilla del Estilo Hawaiian tacos - I love pineapple and ham in anything!  Carne Asada tacos Lime Agua Frescas Mango/Coconut Licuados   Do yourself a favor and get yourself down to Sunnyslope to check this spot out.  The prices are ridiculously good, and the food is authentic and just freakin' delicious.  Don't miss it."}
{"text":"As others say ... I HAD TO order the Giant Man vs. Food Del Rey Torta.  Just like the pictures already taken ... this thing is Humongous!  I can't believe I ate the whole thing. The wife got the Alambre de res torta which was also very good if not better. Fun place to check out with friends.  Prices are good and the food is pretty good. It is cool to watch them cook in the open kitchen. It can get pretty busy depending on what time of day it is when you get there. Expect a lot of people."}
{"text":"Amazing place with plenty of authentic Mexican food choices for anyone in the family."}
{"text":"First time here, food was good, service was good."}
{"text":"Tried the shredded shrimp tacos; they were delicious. The strawberry margarita was delicious. Also tried the shrimp quesadilla and they were ok. The reason for my 3 stars, I wish the shrimp in the quesadilla were de-vaned and the margarita came in a glass a little bigger than a wine glass"}
{"text":"I'd come here again. My husband & I shared the Carlos V $27.50.   It has 7 different meats, 2 cheese, an omelet, chipotle sauce, tomato, onion, avocado & chipotle dressing!!!!! It was ginormous & delicious! We also had the banana milk smoothie with was made with fresh bananas, yum yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a Torta once in awhile? The inside at this location has a giant eating area for families and then some and is decorated with lots of fun colors. There are several TV's that you can stare at while zoning out to your special occasion. Interestingly festive music envelopes the room. I think I even saw a small stage with speakers. Hmmm?  Giant menu with lots of different items and pictures to choose from if you are not in the mood for a Torta. I'm hungry already!  Free salsa and chips arrive at the table instantly and are very tasty. I did the Man vs Food last time and it took me over the edge. This time ordered the Nortena de Res which is steak with onions & jalapenos with chipotle sauce, melted cheese, refried beans, tomato, avocado, & chipotle dressing. I always enjoy the fresh radishes and cucumbers served as a garnishment.  Service was quick and friendly. I liked the way the inside was so clean. Even saw someone doing some touch ups on the front window which is always good. Just need a pinata to whack full of candy as you leave for giggles. They are so much fun. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have not had many tortas in my time, but that was a mistake that now needs to be corrected on a monthly basis or so. This location is really not meant for gringos as I was greeted in Spanish and even asked for my order in espanol, but most staff are bi-lingual. It is just a matter of whether they feel like talking in English. Still, they all were very nice and smiled alot and the food was great. The menu is large, but I had to try the famous torta's and I ended up with a safe choice for a rookie. It was sliced thin well done steak with guac and mexican cheese and a dash of chipotle sauce on that great soft bun. Torta came with ruffles chips and they also served Mexican chips and a red salsa (which was good) prior to the meal. This was a good sandwich, all the flavors made every bite a joyous thing. Some excellent Mexican music in the background and a $10 check (with can of soda) made this trip into the barrio a successful one."}
{"text":"Los Reyes de la Torta (LRdlT) was my family's 3rd stop in our quest to try Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and Man vs Food restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale, AZ area.  My family loved the DDD restaurants we experienced and LRdlT was going to be our one and only M vs F restaurant to try.  If there are any other Yelpers looking for a M vs F restaurant to eat at in Phoenix, LRdlT must be your 1st stop.  LRdlT is located in a mini strip mall.  At first glance, you probably would question how one of the best sandwiches could be cooked here because the restaurant looked simple and unassuming.  Highly recommend that you arrive around 5pm to beat the dinner rush.  The restaurant is not too big and the secret is out about how great the food is at LRdlT.  If you come after 6pm, expect to wait and you'll be jealous watching the lucky people eat some delicious, mouth-watering authentic Mexican food.  How do you gauge whether a Mexican restaurant has legit food?  Mexicans frequent the restaurant.  As we were eating, the waiting area filled up with Mexican brothers and sisters from another mother.  A Mexican torta is a sandwich with such Mexican meats as carne asada, pollo asada, carnitas, etc.  Adam Richman of Man vs Food fame introduced me to the Del Rey and the King Carlos V tortas.  If you want to accept the food challenge Adam performed on the show, you'll have to eat the humongous King Carlos in 15 minutes.  If you're successful, you won't have to pay the $25 for the sandwich.  No thanks, the Del Rey was more than enough for my overstuffed belly.  If you want a filling and very tasteful samwich, the Del Rey will make you thank Adam Richman out loud.  The Del Rey is comprised of ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, hotdog meat, chorizo, omelette, tomato, onions, avocado, and chipotle sauce, all squeezed between soft, nicely toasted bread.  This conglomeration of meat, milk, bread, and vegetables will satisfy all food groups and your daily caloric intake in just one sitting.  To be honest, I probably could have finished the entire sandwich, but I split it with the wifey to save room for our other food excursions while on vacation.  You honestly can't fathom how amazing this torta is until you experience it yourself.  Ask for the grilled onions and jalapenos, which complement the torta.  To help the food go down, a must order is the watermelon agua fresca.  This will satisfy your thirst.  Why oh why do my best food ever reside in places other than San Diego.  Adam Richman, you got it right recommending Los Reyes de la Torta.  The Del Rey was so worth sacrificing my slim waistline.  Until we meet again Del Rey, I'll be dreaming of how much I enjoyed engulfing you."}
{"text":"These are the best Tortas I've ever had! The Tortas come with a fried egg typically. Be adventurous, and give it a shot even if its later in the day."}
{"text":"When I first saw the place from the outside I was expecting it to be just another Mexican dive.   I was wrong. The inside is nice, the staff is friendly and the food is good. I'm not usually a fan of tortas but these are an exception.   Even the Mexican music they played wasn't the annoying polka sounding crap you find in other places.   Very pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch with my daughter today at this place. Decided to try it since I keep hearing good things about their food.  We were there around 2:PM and place was almost empty.  We were seated right away and a waitress brought us chips and salsa and took our drinks orders. Chips tasted fresh and salsa was good it only needed a bit of salt to my taste. In fact everything we ate needed salt.  I order a creamy strawberry agua fresca to drink and my daughter got a Dr. Pepper (can they don't have fountain drinks).  My agua fresca was super good!! So good we ended up ordering one to go after we were done with our lunch!!! I must add this was the best part of my meal!!!!  My daughter order from the kids menu a quesadilla; she asked to replace carne asada with chorizo; which by the way came with beans and rice as side dishes.  Her beans were great and rice was ok.  I'm guessing her quesadilla was great cause I didn't get to try it as fast as she ate it.   I order a corn quesadilla with chicharron El King style.  The corn tortilla is handmade and super delicious. I didn't like the chicharron so much but maybe cause I'm not used to that type of flavor. It was a bit too strong.  So almost half way I decided to take the chicharron out and eat the corn tortilla with the extra toppings (sour cream, queso fresco, onions and cilantro). My quesadilla came along with ice berg salad which by the way looked so old I didn't even attempted to eat it.    I gave them three stars because the place look clean, waitresses were kind and very efficient and I didn't have to wait too long for my drinks or food. But everything we ate including the three different kind of salsas they brought to the table needed lots of salt. I must add that I usually don't add extra salt to my meals but this time I just had to or my food wouldn't had taste like anything.    I'll definitely go back and give it another try. Most of all because the the Aguas Frescas!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside appearance scare you away. Tasty quesadillas, tortas, omelettes, and horchata. Nice staff."}
{"text":"This place is consistently great. I've brought many people here, and I've always loved it. I'm not even a big fan of Mexican food, but man I love the Ranchera steak torta. Just thinking about it is giving me cravings.  You won't find tortas like this anywhere else. Since eating here, I've started looking for tortas at other places and I'm always disappointed that they're either not there or they're terrible in comparison."}
{"text":"This restaurant has some pretty GOOD TORTAS....MMMM MMMM MMMM...THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY....they're delicious and very worth it. They're prices are decent, the girls have great customer service and very friendly....i wish i could of stayed there to eat but i was too tired so i got it to go. Not only is the food great but fast also.....next time i will relax and have a margarita while i wait for my food....."}
{"text":"Our visit tonight was awesome! The venue was classy and clean. The food was out of this world! They have a decent variety of Vegetarian dishes and if you are looking for margaritas - here is the place! The servers were friendly and efficient. The portion size was generous and the price reasonable. I will be back!  A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"One of the BEST tortas I've ever had in my life.  Deliciously fresh food, decent portions and great service in a very authentic joynt with great service provided by so many lovely latinas.  Get there before noon if you're going for lunch, else after 2pm.  Oh, and don't forget to wash it all down with some refreshing horchata.  So looking forward to going back.  Next time I won't be splitting my torta with anybody, así que no mames güey!"}
{"text":"Well, right now I am sporting a very large Del Ray baby and have a huge smile on my face. I just brought home some food from  here and it was fantastic! I of course saw this place on Man V Food and had to give it a try since it was not to far from my house. This was my first time trying a Torta. I actually had no idea there was a Mexican style sandwich and I have been living in Phoenix for 42 years now. Where the hell have I been right? Well, I drove over and walked in and was pleasantly surprised. It was a very nice place. Nice and clean, the staff was very nice and helpful. The place was pretty packed and I had to stand in line for a bit to place my order. I ended up ordering a Del Ray Torta and something else I dont know the name of right now. It was a fried tortilla with beans, pork, lettuce and cheese. Both were extremely good. I had planned to take a few bites of the pork tortilla and put the rest in the fridge for tomorrow but that didnt happen. This thing was great and I ended up eating the hole damn thing. I then started in on my Torta. THIS WAS FANTASTIC!!!! If I would have known I would have started with this first. I polished off half of it pretty quickly. I then sat back and relaxed for a minute before starting in on the second half. This was the end of my partaking for the evening. I realized how incredibly full I was and I didnt think it would be a good idea trying to put anymore down there. I am now sitting here trying to type and breathe and not doing well at either.         If you try this place just make sure you remember one thing, don't order to much because you will eat EVERYTHING you order. Then you will not be able to breathe or move. But your taste buds will love you."}
{"text":"The food here is large!  And very tasty. It's a sit down restaurant with many drink options but no alcohol. We had the Tortas and they were both excellent. Definitely come here hungry."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here for couple of years now and was not disappointed. Got the torta del ray and was amazing. The veggies on the side were perfectly cooked. Everything tasted wonderful. A definite try in the valley."}
{"text":"I am so mad that I have not gone to this place before! The tortas are amazing and I do not have a single bad thing to say about them. This will absolutely be one of my regular places to eat. If you have not gone yet, you should!!"}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and try and be sweet ...  Food is OK... fruit drinks are so not worth the price (all foam) Service is good This place is overrated....  So not worth the hype! Remember folks not everything on TV is good."}
{"text":"Really an interesting spot, with a menu that will make you wonder what other Mexican dishes exist that other casual Mex restaurants don't offer. The options are wildly different from what you may be used to. I may have chosen wrong with the house specialty featuring hot dogs. Not for me; maybe you? I suggest trying the spot to find out. We were here a while back, and at the time no liquor, wine or beers available, so consider that."}
{"text":"Update:  Went back in February 2018 and it was still fantastic!  Very friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Start off with delicious chips and salsa, then order a fresh drink that is made to order, then take your pick from their authentic Mexican menu! I love the tacos and gorditas. I've also had their chicken enchiladas. These are not Tex-Amex style, the enchiladas are made just like abuela would make them. My go-to Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"Haven't had Mexican in a while and this place touched on every detail!! A must for a casual dinner!!!"}
{"text":"It's hard to tell others about this place.  At least the people I know.  I get one of two responses:  \"You order a SANDWICH at a Mexican restaurant?\"  Yes, a sandwich.  It's not weird.  It's not even unique.  It's a sandwich.  You put turkey on yours.  They put ham, hot dog, carne, egg, chorizo, guacamole, mayo, and pico on theirs.  Okay, maybe it's unique.  At the very least, it's better than that quesadilla you're ordering.  But go right ahead.  More torta for me!  \"SUNNYSLOPE?\"  Yes, Sunnyslope.  I don't shoot meth.  I've never picked up a hooker.  Yeah, there's a lot of Mexicans.  But I'm Mexican, so maybe I should be offended that you pointed it out.  No, it's not scary.  You don't need to lock your car door as badly as you think you do.  Torta Kings, you had me at, \"breaded beef.\""}
{"text":"Location, cleanliness, and service wise this place is great. The food itself? Nothing too special. We had visited this place a few months back and the service sucked so bad I vowed never to return. . only to be convinced to do so again. It seems the staff was upgraded and management really stepped up their game. But it all goes back to the food, nothing too outstanding, just your typical Mexican chain restaurant,"}
{"text":"What an excellent lunch I had here! Rand H. organized a little UYE for this place with Mike C., Robyn N., Arlin B. and myself. The establishment is in a rather cramped commercial strip but the restaurant itself is quite roomy, although it doesn't look it at first when you enter. I ordered a ceviche appetizer; this was the best ceviche I've ever had -- I would come here just for this! For my entree, I had the bistecas y huevos with rice and beans; it came with sides of avocado and Mexican cheese. I also had a refreshing glass of mango agua fresca which accompanied the meal perfectly. Great food, great prices, and great service even when the place is busy - no wonder this place is so popular."}
{"text":"You want authentic mexican food? Say no more. Head over to this restaurant and your mexcan taste buds will be satisfied, no doubt. This place has been my favorite mexican food place for over 10 years and there is so much variety and flavor.   I would recommend the Alambre de Camarones (Shrimp with beans and rice) or a Qusadilla estilo del Rey (really good quesadilla). The staff is friendly and I've never had a problem with the food. The owner is awesome too. He's friendly and REALLY likes to talk. Lol   Anyway, definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Second time trying the restaurant.  They were busy but the wait was about 10 minutes.  The service  was slow . Tried two appetizers. Cheese crisp quick was very good. The hot sauce was tangy but not hot . Shrimp  cerviche was dry . We had three tortas.  Beef  was dry. Pork was good and the special was interesting conglomeration of multiple meats top with an egg. Beef was dry"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was great!  We ordered the queso fundito with chorizo and jalapeños as an appetizer,  delish (order extra tortillas).  We ordered the Chuleta tacos and they were fantastic!!!  The only down side is there is NO ALCOHOL OR BEER."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a vegetarian section on the menu. The cactus tacos and veggie torta were delicious. Beans were good too! Plenty of warm chips and salsa. They have an extensive drink menu with juices and blended fruit drinks, but I was a little disappointed to find they don't serve alcohol since we found them by googling \"margaritas in Tempe.\" Food was good enough to try again!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. I went with the mini del rey. I had to tap out, but whoa. Loved every bite. I also had guac and chips. Great thick chips and fantastically flavorful guac with a subtle kick.  Wish I would have had room for dessert to try something else."}
{"text":"Thank you Man Vs. Food for introducing us to this place. This was our first dinner stop on our little vacation in Phoenix. Be forewarned this place does not have any curbside appeal, and we actually ran into some shady people on the way in. But the appeal is in those huge tortas. We opted for the original Del Rey torta and an amazing Aguas Frescas and Pina Colada. The drinks are HUGE! The tortas are even bigger. The only down side is their Ruffle-like side of chips they serve. I mean can't we at least get some tortilla chips or something. Throw us a bone here.  Other than those horrible chips, everything else is amazing. The flavor of meat in the torta is unbelievable. And make sure to order an Aguas Frescas. So refreshing and so ginormous. Try this place if your are in AZ. It is a must!"}
{"text":"3pm on a Tuesday.  Waitress is on top of her game. The service was perfect. Agua de avena is delicious. Torta Del Rey is absolutely a killer. My taste buds were going into a frenzy from all angles, ham one second, avocado, breaded beef, beans, sausage, cheese, soft bread salsa roja.  For desert I got an esquimo. I wasnt a fan of this to me it taste like strawberry quik. Next time I'll have a different desert.  This place lives up to its hype."}
{"text":"If only it wasn't all the way up there... i'd be on it like a lush at the FEZ happy hour... margaritas, martinis oh my! Anyways that's how I would describe my dinner outing to Los Reyes de la Torta with my best, Sara V.   She thought of it and I bought it... so off we went after work on Monday night to Los Teyes de la Torta for some Torta goodness. The only Torta I've had prior is at Gallo Blanco. and they Ribeye there is delicious but here we were at Los Reyes and the menu was huuugggge! Sara V. was hungry so we started with an app, the chicharron quesadilla estilo del rey which is with queso, pico, onions, and jalapenos. I got horchata as a drink, and Sara V. got mango juice. Felt tropical and I guess it went with the feeling of mugginess outside. Anywho, the quesadilla was big, and really a meal in itself. For our entrees we decided to split two tortas, they were the Arizona Torta  and the Mexicana Torta - steak, sauteed onions, jalapenos. They were both big in its own right, half a torta is filling on its own.   Sum up our experience, the tortas are really good, altho i can always pass up the Mexicana and try something else. The horchata was alright, nothing phenomenal unlike La Condesa which has a very interesting and really yummy Horchata. Not a big fan of Mexican mangoes coz personally I don't think that they're sweet, Filipino mangoes are still Queen! The quesadilla was yummy, liked it very much. I think it's proof that when more than half their clientele are Latinos is that it's a good torta shop. The dinner was not pricey and I had leftovers but really liked it and will come back soon!"}
{"text":"I am a trend following hipster I will admit. I had no idea this gem existed. My friends and I have been on a string of man v. Food eats and this was exceptional. Had the torta del Rey and a resulting coma. Loved it and will be going back."}
{"text":"I love the service at this Restaurant .My server was very kind and open to different menu options,she was very kind, and confident.. the Quesadilla there is amazing.they also have a great Torta there. So I recommend to anyone who is from Mexico City.Chilango"}
{"text":"my biggest complaint was how long it took for the delivery followed by the fact that the food was cold.  I really just want to blame the driver and I am sorry I tipped him in advance.  I am not going to try them for delivery again."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Los Reyes I ordered the Del Rey (before Man Vs Food)...  That was the last time I ordered it.  I was unaware of what I was getting myself into and was pretty embarrassed when it came to the table.  I definitely should not have ordered 2 of the ceviche tostadas to start!  That being said, the ceviche tostadas were great and for $.99 can't be beat.  The platillo de pechuga asada estan muy bueno, it's really, really good.  I have never been let down by anything I have ordered here.  From the quesadillas to the burritos to the mariscos, everything has been great."}
{"text":"Love the food!  Always hot and fresh! Love the hospitality!  The staff is ALWAYS friendly and attentive to our needs!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"great food! Everyone in there moves fast and food comes out super fast too!"}
{"text":"We just visited last night with the whole family, that means, with our 3 kids, and surprisingly it was almost empty when we got there. We've been to the other location many times, the one in Sunnyslope, and it is always crowded there, so here we were greeted with the openness of the place, we liked that.    People started coming in, at the end of our meal it was almost full, but you could still walk between the rows of tables and chairs, no problem. The down side is, that maybe because it's not so busy as the other location, ingredients are being made way ahead and don't taste as fresh, like the corn tortillas for the quesadillas, or the \"chicharrón prensado\", they tasted dryer then expected. Nevertheless, it good, not great, but good all around. We ordered from the \"Aguas Frescas\" section, those are always super-good, when the fruit they use are ripe. I had the Cremosa de Fresa, hubby ordered a cremosa de Piña, my son ordered the Agua de Mango, and the younger ordered sodas. On our food order we had a Quesadilla de Chicharrón Prensado al estilo Rey (huge serving of corn quesadilla with Chicharrón, covered with creme, cilantro and onions), Pambazo de Chicharrón Prensado (Telera bread filled with the chicharrón and cheese, and then the whole torta is covered with their red sauce, it's messy to eat, but taste so good!), Large carne asada quesadilla, with a side of pico de gallo, avocado and beans, and finally, a Milanesa de Pollo (Chicken Milanese), this one with a side of rice and beans. It was a lot of food, but we tried our best to polish the plates! We recommend it, even if it wasn't exactly how we are used to, maybe it was just a fluke, it was a slow day for them. I would go back just for the drinks!!"}
{"text":"This place makes me wish I live in the Phoenix area.  If we had one of these where I live, I would surely be close to 300 lbs in no time.    The food is simply amazing.  Simple, flavorful, and very good portions.  Try finishing their special torta for a quick check on the portion size."}
{"text":"I ordered the torta de carne asada and was disappointed... Don't get me wrong, the meat was delicious but the torta didn't have much of it. It was pretty flat compared to the pictures on here. Next time we come, I'll order something different. My brother ordered the Torta del Rey and he loved it. Our overall service was good."}
{"text":"Del Ray Torta was big and flavorful.  Everyone loved the agua fresca!"}
{"text":"Ewwwww   Are people just giving this place good reviews bc they want to pretend like they're super cool and are totally down with hole in the wall places in the hood??   Bc this was seriously nast. We ordered the queso w chorizo and that was bomb, I'll give them that.  Our food came out, I had one bite of my chilaquiles and was like ready to spit it out. The green sauce was creepy and the steak was very off in flavor and not seasoned at all. I asked for a to go box and boxed up the steak to feed my dogs.   My friend ordered their torta. She was like 'I can't tell if I don't like this bc it's gross or bc I'm full' I tasted it and was like 'bc it's gross.' she called me today to tell me she tried eating it for breakfast but threw it out bc it was nasty.   We'll be sticking to the torta from Gallo Blanco, bc even though their service sucks, at least their torta is amazeballs.   Seriously some of the grossest food I've tasted. The staff was friendly and the place was clean and packed. I just personally find the food super nasty."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Came out in 10 minutes. I got the Asada Burro and I gotta say the carne asada was very flavorful and the server was very friendly. I vote 5 as incredibly satisfied and full. Me and my date spent under 20 bucks and we took leftovers. I'm coming back for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars. We absolutely love this place. We have a big family so whenever there is a birthday in our family,we always go here. They are more than happy to seat all 18 of us! And it's not easy finding places to eat who will seat all if us. The food is excellent as well as the customer services."}
{"text":"Amazing , very authentic.  The best shrimp tostada I have ever had. Best place to find by accident."}
{"text":"This has now become my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix.I saw this place on Man vs Food and thought I would give it a try. The way I look at it, if a Mexican restaurant is full (and I mean full) of Mexican people, the food has to be good and I was not disappointed. The restaurant is nothing special, just a bunch of tables in a huge room. The server was very polite and seated us immediately. She brought us some fresh tortilla chips and probably some of the best salsa I have tasted. I ordered the torta Del Rey which was absolutely fantastic. It was so filling I could not finish it. I also had the mango licuados which was exactly like I tasted in Mexico. I will definitely go back and try some of their other great looking items. Try it out, you won't be disappointed. There is also another location on 7th Ave."}
{"text":"The reviews are true, this place rocks in a big way. I've been wanting to try go here for months and finally found the time during a vacation day and was blown away by the food. Incredible flavors, piping hot as it just came off the grill, not from under a heat lamp. My wife and I both had the Torta Nortena, it was huge and delicious! Comes with your choice of chips or salad, get the salad! Fresh lettuce, radish, cucumbers, & a grill jalapeno and onion-mouth watering. The menu is huge and I can't wait to go back and try some of the other dishes. A friend that was with us got a platter and had to bring half of it home. The prices are very, very reasonable for what you get. I'll be taking all my out of town friends here. If they thought Chino Bandito was cool, wait until they get a taste of LRDLT!"}
{"text":"Soo I was unsure about coming here, but I mentioned to someone I would come. I found out about this place on Man V. Food I think or the internet. Anyway, I came all the way from Chandler to N. Phx to try this place.   I was expecting a more quieter atmosphere at the time but they were blasting the soccer game. Also chips and salsa are not provided.   The menu has a lot to choose from, I was soo undecided. However, I came here for the Torta del Rey, so thus that is what I ordered. I want to try to carne asada next time. Anyway, I knew it was going to be a huge sandwich. Lo and behold it was presented to me and all I did was gasp. WOW! It was a sandwich plus potato chips as a side (weird).  Let me remind you I am a nutrition student, this is far from healthy....ham, cheese, egg, chorizo, pork strips, etc.  Great tasting sandwich, but I much preferred it with the green sauce they provided. I downed that first half in no time, but I could no conquer the whole sandwich.   Great big sandwich for $9, not bad. Considering I could enjoy the other half later on. I would definitely go back to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"My friend showed me the Man vs. Food segment showcasing Los Reyes de la Torta and  so we came to Phoenix for SF Giants Fantasy baseball camp, we decided to try Torta Del Rey.  All the bragging about how big and tasty this torta is true.  I had a fabulous dinner here that was delicious, quickly served, and very affordable.  You would think that the torta would come with some tortilla chips, but no!  Instead, you get a side order of ruffles potato chips.  It's a great combination with the torta.  After a long day of playing baseball, I devoured the torta and the chips with ease.    There are a lot of interesting choices on the menu and it intrigued me.  I wish I lived closer because I would like to try other dishes.    Los Reyes de la Torta...absolutely the Kings of the Torta!"}
{"text":"I went to Los Reyes de la Torta since it's been announced to have the best Torta or whatever. Well I ordered the \"mini\" Torta el principe and it was terrible. The onions were burnt, not caramelized, the meat was super chewy, the bread wasn't cut evenly resulting in a super thin bottom that was ripped BEFORE I could try to pick it up, and the bottom bread was super soggy with grease. There was no seasoning in the Torta or any real flavor. I also ordered the cucumber, celery, and lime drink which was room temperature, didn't have any flavor except for being super sweet."}
{"text":"Best torta ever!!! La del rey is just an explosion of flavors!!! I wish the grilled onions and chiles werent extra. Do yourselves a favor and buy the restaurant.com coupons. Saves you money when its 3 or more peeps with you."}
{"text":"Man, you probably seen this place on Man v Food and it's the real deal. The Del Ray is legit. It's like a dang kitchen sink full of sandwich stuffs to feed your face. You should come here if you want some real deal Mexican sandwiches."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy authentic mexican food!  Their Tortas are awesome, and so are the quesadillas. I love that the quesadillas have veggies inside."}
{"text":"To be honest I'm shocked by all of the 5 star reviews. My husband and I brought a family member from out of town here. We spent 75 bucks, didn't order any seafood or alcohol. The food is mediocre not terrible and the service was TERRIBLE. Like it was 3 of us, our server walked off before my husband could order. Then our food took forever yet it was kinda cold, that probably didnt help the taste, since the hot dog in my husbands torta was cold. The waitresses were more busy gossiping than checking in on us or refilling our drinks. The restaurant wasn't that busy to have been neglected like that. We were so embarrassed with our guest. We were trying to act cool but finally our family member said something in his super polite way. We will never ever be back. Sucks because i had high hopes."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Mexican restaurant for a while. This place has super friendly customer service. I ordered a fish tacos because I usually don't eat meat.  The menu says super tacos which I expected to be larger than the regular tacos on the menu. When the food came out, in my opinion, these tacos look the same size as the Tacos de asada that my friend ordered. I like the flavor but the texture of the tacos are a bit rubbery in the edge.  I tried the tres leches King Cake. I would not say I don't like it but since I don't like very sweet dessert, I gave up after one bite but people who like sweet food may thing this is good.  The horchata is delicious. Although a first few sips, I felt powders in it but still, that was good PS: I'm saying this from a Tucsonian's perspective because Tucson offers a variety of authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"I won't lie .... I saw this restaurant featured on Man vs Food and had absolutely ZERO desire to eat here.  The sight of the food did not look appetizing to me.  OMG was I wrong! I went here to celebrate a co-worker's promotion and I absolutely raved about it for the rest of the day.  I had the Alambre de pollo Torta and I couldn't have been happier.  First off, the torta is massive. The only reason I got as close as I did to finishing it was because it was so amazing, I couldn't put it down.  Second off, well, it's amazing.  The only downside is that it gets crowded easily because it's still a pretty small place and because we went at lunch, it took an awfully long time to get our food ---- granted, we were a party of 8 so I'm not surprised.  I would definitely go again and would DEFINITELY recommend it to someone who's hungry!!"}
{"text":"Very interesting menu, very authentic, nice people.  First time Torta girl here....very tasty, could use more guacamole (but couldn't everything!).  Great guacamole.  Enchiladas mole were good also.  The flavors were different for us, but we enjoyed very much."}
{"text":"Everything I have eaten here is delicious- the drinks, food, desserts, appetizers, everything!! They also have really affordable prices which is the best part!! You can buy a meal for $6! I get full off the mini tortas. And for the price it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Family friendly with delicious food! 4 stars only because I really wish they served margaritas!"}
{"text":"The Mexican food Gods and Goddesses have possessed the mortal bodies of the people who work in the Los Reyes De La Torta kitchen to grace us with their magical food.   I swear every time I eat here I am transported to another realm of taste bud enchantment.  The servers are super sweet and kind. So casual yet so much \"sabor!'. I love Los Reyes De La Torta.   I am still trying to figure out if it is the food that is soul shattering amazing, or that the fact that I watched Adam Richman devour a torta on Man Vs. Food made me love this place even more. I swear, there is nothing sexier than a man who loves to eat delicious food. I could watch Adam Richman all day omg... So freaking hot... Wow I'm so weird but whatever. This place is awesome, go check it out and gain a new addiction to your list!  Viva Los Reyes de La Torta!!"}
{"text":"agua de sandia! in loooove! Food is also so good and service was quick (we visited around 4 on a Friday) but all around really good and would definitely keep coming back, yum!"}
{"text":"delicious! def got the sandwich Adam on Man vs Food got! i think it's called Del Reys! it was sooooooooo good and the sandwich was huge, the price was great! however, there was a long wait, so I'd say be patient for their services!!"}
{"text":"I was quite excited to go here based upon all the reviews on Yelp and by friends but was a bit disappointed.  We only ordered the Fortas and there was very little meat compares to the bread sizes. While the salsa was tasty it wasn't very filling or satisfying.  Their \"chips\" we're Ruffles. Overall maybe would consider it if I had a coupon and would try something else"}
{"text":"Arrived early evening. Long line is a good sign to me. The smell is wonderful. Soda from a real bottle. YES! This s a really nice place with excellent food."}
{"text":"Omg im obsessed with their food. The king tacos de res are insanely delicious. Also the huevos divorciados are to die for. Reminds me of my vacations in Mexico, come here for great food!!"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect! I got the Pancho Villa torta and my wife got the carne asada casadillia. I ate the whole thing and her left overs! Their drinks don't contain alcohol, but you won't care. They are no less than delicious! Our waitress was lovely, polite and attentive."}
{"text":"So delicious! I had no idea this place existed, as it is kind of tucked back off the cross street - but I'm glad we found it. The food is great and so are their desserts! You must go and try their carne asada tacos!!"}
{"text":"I had  northern sandwich which was recommended by  the hostess. Omg it was so.good and fulfilling. Two.people could ate it but I stuffed the whole thing. Worth the ten bucks  will be back"}
{"text":"I should have written a review long ago but forgot about it. Fact is, my wife and I have been going there for some time and we have found that the tortas are always wonderful.  Today I had the steak torte Norteno.  I can't think of a way that it could have been better. The cheese funditio is also a great favorite."}
{"text":"The service was great! Horchata was awesome and the tacos were also great!  We got some quesadillas and some enchiladas ( different than az mex food) It's not your typical American Mexican food you would find at Manuel's or macayos, it's actually real Mexican food from Mexico City.    I really liked. The tortas are huge here!!   I don't know is they brought me out 2 tacos by accident or not, but they said I could just have then as a \"regalo \".  The restaurant is kept super clean and the service was awesome.   As we were leaving one of the waiters gave is a discount coupon to come back! I will be back here again!!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend going here.  There are so many better options.  The food was very dry and made 2 of us sick.  They do not serve alcohol and the meat tasted months old.  Save yourself, don't go."}
{"text":"torta with guacamole, ham, breaded pork, meat, more meat, and topped with a fried egg with sides of radishes, cucumbers and ruffled chips!!!   portions are humungous!!! definitely fill you up goooood and make you proud that you just downed the whole torta!  or force you to run 5 miles...  cerviches were delish...nothing skimpy at all on a tortilla chip. guacamole and shrimp were fresh..squeeze of lime=refreshing  quesadilla was huge! stuffed with meat and cheese  drinks are huge as well, pina drinks with a tiny umbrella and pineapple wedge  as for dessert...if you still have room, chocolate flan cake! it was about 15% flan 85% chocolate cake.  top that with whipped cream and a cherry and drooooll......  this place s definitely somewhere to go to splurge and eat it all out! i felt like man vs food trying to finish everything we ordered. they even have this huge torta that is free is you can finish it within 15 minutes......"}
{"text":"had the chicken mini torta and it was awesome! next day i had the chilaquiles and they were great too!"}
{"text":"No booze. Food is authentic and delicious but they don't have any alcohol.  Not even tequila."}
{"text":"I really love their food, from tacos to tortes and quesadilla, all delicious. My only complaint is they serve potato chips with the tortas, would be nice if they created their own side dish. Also the Fresas con crema and Aguas Fresca are yummy"}
{"text":"I quickly found a parking right in front of the restaurant. I could smell the food instantly. I walked in at noon and was seated immediately in the main room where the kitchen is. I noticed two additional rooms - one to the left that looked like more of a party room with a bar and one room to the right that had a big screen TV in it. The staff was very helpful. I ordered the 3 King Tacos for $8.99. You get your choice of chicken or steak, not both.  The meal is served with guacamole and rice or salad. The orange sauce they serve on the side is HOT!  Oh yeah, and the waitresses look half-decent, too, on top of their friendly service."}
{"text":"This place deserves a visit.  You love Mexican.  I love Mexican.  but face it... we've both been lazy haven't we.  we go to the 'berto's places. we have our favorite Tex-Mex neighborhood joints.  and maybe we got a wild hair and went to La Parilla Suiza for a different style of Mexican food.  but we haven't pushed the envelope, and it's time we did!  so get yourself over to Sunnyslope and try Los Reyes de la Torta.  First of all, brace yourself.... you will not get chips and salsa.  and when you look at the menu, you won't see your fave burritos or tacos offered.  get over it.  your mouth is about to be the happiest part of your body!  they offer a wide variety of \"tortas\" (sandwiches to you, gringo) and like any good sandwich place, you order them with \"The Works\".  At Los Reyes, that means a whole pile of ingredients and they're all suicculent.  Agua Fresca?  Just say yes and name a fruit... within moments, a giant margarita style glass will be placed in front of you containing a smoothie based on aforementioned fruit plus a giant garnish of same.  I ordered the Mango version and cannot remember ever sipping  a more satisfying, delicious concoction, which went perfectly with my torta choice, the Del Rey torta, large enough to pose a serious challenge to Adam Richman on Man vs. Food.  In my case, Food won, but the torta, containing pork, ham, beef, eggs, guacamole, onions, tomatoes, cheese, chorizo, and yes even a hot dog, was a glutton's wet dream.  I suggest you come with a group of at least 6 people so you can order a bunch of different things and share them around. Try this place."}
{"text":"Here is my honest assessment of Los Reyes de la Torta.  It's a three-star place.  The atmosphere is a bit dumpy.  My apologies to those who think reviews should focus strictly on food, but atmosphere is what I notice when I walk in the door.  Plus, despite the fact that the place was mostly, we were led to the table closest to the restrooms.  Seriously?    The star of the show here is obviously the tortas.  I tried the egg one, which had cheese and a very generous serving of sliced avocados.  This torta was delicious and a great value.  The other one I tried had chicken, onions, and some other stuff.  It reminded me of what they have at the Great Steak and Potato Company.  Not that that's a bad thing.  For the tortas I give 5 stars.    Other stuff:  No alcohol.  'Nuff said.  Greasy potato chips as a side?  That was kind of a bummer.  I was craving tortilla chips or fries or anything a little more exciting than potato chips right out of the bag.  The flan was really dense and tasted like it was prepared forever ago in a huge vat.  Skip it.  You probably won't be hungry anyway after the tortas so don't get tempted by the pictures on the menu."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today.  The place looks just like you would expect and was packed.  I was in a hurry so I ordered my torta to go.  It was like $10 for the torta and a can of soda and it was ready in about 5 minutes.  I have eaten a lot of very random and very no-so-good-for-you food in my day but this torta may take the lead.  As I started to chow down on my  Torta Del Rey 3 things went through my mind:  #1 - wtf am I eating #2 - my wife is going to kill me for setting my diet back 2 years and clogging my arteries even more #3 - how the fu*k am I supposed to eat this thing without getting it all over my shirt and pants.  I am a torta virgin and I think this might have been my first legit torta experience.  I have never in all my life seen a sandwich with so much sh*t piled on.  I took one bite like a normal sandwich then I gave up for fear of making a complete mess of myself.  I stuck to the fork and knife method which worked much better.  Anyway, the taste of the torta is just ok because there really isn't much flavor going on.  To be honest I was expecting an explosion of flavors from all the stuff on the torta but it was just eh.  The hot sauces (both red and green) were great and added to the flavor.    I would go back but would probably not have the torta.  The rest of their menu looks pretty good and authentic but after tasting their flagship cuisine; I'm not expecting greatness.  I'm giving this place 4 stars because of the uniqueness (at least to me) and authenticity of the food."}
{"text":"Here's what happened... I blacked out, got punched in the stomach and left with a few dollars less in my bank account.  It sounds terrible, I know, but it was my fault for eating too much. There were way too many things on the menu that I wanted to try so I ended up getting the Del Rey. That sandwich is F-ing loaded! I mean, I'm all about excess sometimes with my food, but this thing has almost everything that you could want from a Mexican joint overflowing in between two halves of bread. Ya only live once though so I went for it, and it was very delicious! I've seen a similar torta on No Reservations in Frisco, but never knew that there was one in the valley. I'm glad I got to try it! Now, because of Man vs Food, most people will only go for the Del Rey. I would like to vouch for the quesadillas there though; they were also excellent! Their salsas are great as well, I just wish they had tortilla chips to go with em! Oh, and did I mention the agua frescas?! Amazing!   It's a great little spot and I'm very glad that a tv show can help out local businesses the way that it does. I'm going to be moving a lot closer to Los Reyes, so I'll probably be in there more often in months to come."}
{"text":"La verdad no volveria a este lugar la comida estaba muy mala y parecia que era de otro dia y nomas la habian calentado , estaba realmente mala , no era lo que esperamos y en el ticket venia cobrada la propina sin nisiquiera preguntar si queriamos dejar"}
{"text":"Your huevos rancheros is my absolute favorite!  My husband and I have been on a search for really good huevos rancheros and yours tops them all.  I love the scoop of avacado on the queso fresca and the big chili that is included.  Yummy"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday and the place was packed. A lot of the servers speak Spanish and the clientele was also of Spanish origin. The drinks are huge so be prepared to share if you order an \"agua fresca\" or a \"mangonada.\" The food came out quickly and I was disappointed in the amount of food for the amount paid. I had three tacos de lengua (tongue) and it was poorly chopped , very chewy, and tasted very gamey. The other 7 in my party had fish which was good . Pan rojo ? I believe and that was a definite get again and some quesadillas that were so small I was almost insulted . I think this may be a place that got too comfortable and has let food quality slip a bit.   The servers are very nice by the way. They added gratuity to my check so lol I won't come back. How entitled of you guys."}
{"text":"This place was packed on a holiday Monday at 2pm!! Had a short 10 min wait. Ordered piña agua fresca to share.. Awesome! Had the shrimp app with the absolute best tasting ceviche I have ever had!! We ordered the beef king tacos and huaraches. Alot of awesome food!!  Friendly atmosphere.. Mexican music... Best bang for the buck!! Can't wait to bring my parents!  Autentico!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Will definitely be back. We were in a hurry so ordered without having a chance to check out the whole menu. We had Assad tacos and Mexicana torta. The bread on the torta was so soft and scrumptious. Like a donut. Can't wait to go back. Only thing missing is margaritas with alcohol."}
{"text":"First time in and had to try the Del Rey Torta. I devoured all of that goodness within 90 seconds flat and not a single regret. Hands down the best sandwich (or Torta?( I'm new to AZ) I ever had. Such goodness many flavor. Satisfaction guaranteed."}
{"text":"Was ok.  My wife enjoyed her Torta. I just wanted a good taco and I ate my whole plate and was still hungry.  I ordered the steak tacos."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last Saturday with our son and grandson.  My husband and I each had one of the Quesadillas de Maiz which is on the appetizer menu.  This is made with a huge and thick corn tortilla, filled with meat and sauce, topped with more sauce and crema and it's very tasty. We took half of it home for lunch the next day.  It cost only $5.50.  Our son had the Torta Norteno.  We learned that Tortas are basically sandwiches served on Hogie type bun.  The bun is very tasty. The grandson had the Torta del Rey which has a crazy list of things in it like ham, pork sirloin, beef, an omelet---and on and on.  These sandwiches are so big that half of them went home for the next day. We ordered the Tres Leches cake for dessert.  The presentation on that rivaled any fancy place you might eat at.  And it was delicious! The service was excellent.  If only all restaurants had this quality of service.      They serve only non-alcoholic beverages but they have Margaritas and Pina Coladas.  You just have to bring your own bottle.        When you walk in you will see TV monitors on Spanish speaking channels and hear lots of Spanish but don't be put off by this, our waitress spoke perfect English.     We'll go there again soon."}
{"text":"Fresh chips even at 4pm.... lunch menu also at 4 pm. Service is satisfactory for the lunch menu orice. For ex: ordered soda and water only soda came. but that's ok. It was only 7. 02 for 3 tacos fresh chips nd salsa also beans nd rice. Can't beat it"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was great! The people were very nice and the ambience is nice to relax and catch your breath. Although our server was a little slow because they were very busy with all the people coming in. Overall I give it 5 stars, amazing food!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times before but never was the experience as bad as this time. First of all we had to wait about 20 minutes which wasn't that bad but what got me mad was they sad people who got there after us before us. They finally sat us down the table where they sat us was so horrible, it stunk like cleaning products and it was next to the bar. We couldn't even talk because every time we would try having a conversation they would turn on the blender. It was so bad that we waiting for our food for about 30 minutes and instead asked for it to go. Last time I bring my family here for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I came here on my lunch break, the place seemed clean and the customer service was ok! They gave us menus took my order and got my food pretty quickly!"}
{"text":"After eating here, it all boils down to one term, mediocre. Me and my fiancee both purchased a torta, and while service was excellent, the food was just, well, average. One thing that hit me was how low quality the ingredients were, the meats tasted like they were purchased in the lunch meat aisle at a supermarket, and brand X meat at that. It didn't taste fresh, and in my sandwich's case (the La Reyna) like they used the cheapest sausage they could find. The breaded chicken on the sandwich had extremely sweet and cheap tasting batter on it. Even the egg tasted like it came out of a carton. Perhaps I just picked a poor sandwich, but my fiancee was not a fan of the Del Ray either, one of their favorite menu items.  Since I do not want to focus on the bad, our drinks were constantly attended to, the food came quickly, and for the price vs filling your belly was positive. Then again when you use such, apparently, cheap ingredients it is no wonder they can keep prices low!  It was a unique experience, just to see the massive sandwiches but we will not be going back."}
{"text":"My friend and I thought we'd give tortas a try. I got the mini Del Rey which didn't seem so mini to me. It had all the meats in it and an omelette. OMG!! My friend got the mini Norteña de Res torta and we both got the small ceviche tostada which was AMAZING!! So delicious! The tortas were delicious too. Mine was quite messy. Next time I'll get a more manageable one. Trying to bite into all that meat was a little overwhelming. Lol!! Be warned the minis aren't very mini. If those were minis then the regular sized ones must be huge!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while looking for a quick bite to eat on the way back to CA. Parking can be tight and making your way to the back lot is a it of a challenge due to the narrow road. Prices are great, because they give you fairly large portions. The drinks they offer are very tasty and come in these giant glass bowls.   Three different staff members approached us and started speaking in Spanish. Only after the awkward silence did they begin to speak in English. I wasn't offended or angry at all though. I thought it was quite funny that they think everybody speaks Spanish. After the awkward silence and stares, all the servers who helped us were very friendly and always willing to help!"}
{"text":"this place is amazing! best burritos and tortas I've had in Arizona. You have to try the torta nortena. The food is great the service is great, no complaints at all. I recommend everyone to try it once."}
{"text":"Delicious. Authentic. Cheap.   Was visiting town for work. Heard about this place from several locals. Did not disappoint. Dishes were big. Fresh. And tasty.   10/10 would come again.   Also, the name is justified...."}
{"text":"Margaritas have no alcohol in them - and you are seriously still charging over $5?  The tortilla chips and salsa were the tastiest part of the meal.  The service was very efficient and friendly but the waiter had a thick accent that was hard to understand.  I ordered the torta with steak, guacamole and sauce on the side.  The bread was the worst torta bread I ever had.  Doughy and white and not grilled.  The steak was flavorless.  The guacamole was to thin - would have preferred big chunks of avocado and the sauce wasn't good either.  My sandwich was served with Ruffles potato chips!  Yuck!  Friend ordered the carne asada mini tacos and wasn't that impressed either.  Hers looked better than mine though!"}
{"text":"First time. Awesome! If I can get a fried egg on something I'll order it. My Torta had egg sausage links avocados ham and cheese. The bun was perfect, light buttery soft. The key here is the ingredients, definitly fresh, even fresh cut cilantro on the burrito we ordered. I know because I grow it in my back yard!  The aguas frescas was not what I expected though. Go to Gallo Blanco and its flavored water in a normal glass. Here its a \"big drink\" glass with an umbrella and fruit on the side, a little embarrassing as a guy with his guy friends. Still good, just a word to the wise. It's more like a blended margarita than what I thought aguas frescas was supposed to be (like at Gallo Blanco)."}
{"text":"After seeing it on Man vs. Food, I had to try this out for myself.  The atmosphere was pleasant, and the food was pretty good for the price, but there was nothing that really jumped out at me.  I had the Torta del Rey, which has a ridiculous amount of food inside: eggs, ham, pork, chorizo, beef, cheese, tomatoes, jalapenos, avocado, and onions (I skipped the refried beans).  And I'm pretty sure there was a plain boiled hot dog in there somewhere.  It's interesting to have all of those meats in the same bite, but none of them really were spectacular.  The best of the bunch was probably the breaded beef, so maybe a sandwich focused on that beef might be a little more memorable.  When I saw that they have potato chips instead of the more common tortilla chips, I figured they must be good.  I've had some excellent homemade chips at several places in town.  But unfortunately, these were just original Ruffles, complete with the preservatives and grease.  For the price, I'd go again if I was in the area, but I don't think I'd make a special trip again."}
{"text":"Best enchilada style burrito I've had in awhile, great staff food and drinks. Going to start coming here more often prices are reasonable, I recommend coming here off you want good Mexican food"}
{"text":"Oh tortas, I didn't know what you were but I'm glad I finally decided to try you. I always get the Arizona. How can you go wrong with an egg on top of breaded beef, with a handful of other delicious ingredients thrown in? I don't think I would venture out to eat anything but their tortas.   The service is pretty prompt. I never had an empty glass, or an empty chip bowl. Speaking of chips, they are pretty good. A little saltier than I'm used to, but still good enough to have an empty bowl by the time the food comes. The salsa could be better... I don't know how to explain the salsa other than really bland. It's not always this way, but this visit was definitely a miss.   I also like their Strawberry milkshake. It's served in a large goblet looking cup, for almost $5 the price is just right. I could just have that as a meal. Check out their desserts and large drink selection (fresh fruit drinks).   Come eat some tortas! It is also good enough to be on food network (Man Vs Food - even though I dislike this show they advertise it, and Diners, drive ins and dives)."}
{"text":"Great food!! Awesome tortas and flans. The complementary salsa it's great with a nice spicy kick."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food on this side of the Valley and maybe even the whole valley. The food is delicious and fresh, the service is excellent and the prices are GREAT! I've brought real Mexicans to this place and they love it. Man vs Food didn't even need to come and plug this place, it's great either way."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Excellent service! Oscar, our waiter was on top of his game and very personable without overdoing it."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times I've lost count.  I love this place.  I have many friends that feel the same way so there's never a shortage of people that want to go here with me.  My only problem is that their closest location to me is 20 minutes from my house; I wish they'd open one closer.  I need them to open one near Tatum and Thunderbird; it would be a raving success.  I've had many of their sandwiches (Tortas), plates (Platillos) and Quesadillas.  I've never had one bad meal.  My friends frequently order their Burros, although I've yet to try them because there's so many other things I want to try.  Perhaps my favorite time to go is for breakfast.  All their breakfast items are excellent but my favorite is their Huevos Rancheros, which is not like any Huevos I've ever had.  It gets very busy around lunch time so I try as best I can to avoid going there from noon until 1:00 pm because there is always a wait.    Their service is wonderful.  Even when they are busy the food comes out fast.  There servers are always rushing around but they take care of the customers and this place is like a well-oiled machine.  Adam Richman (\"Man vs. Food\") did a segment on his TV show here several years ago.  If you haven't seen it, go to their website and it is available to view.  This is a unique, different and wonderful Mexican restaurant.  Don't expect the typical."}
{"text":"Its all about that Del Ray Torta. Nuff said, great joint. I haven't tried anything else here, but can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Ok so before I moved to Tempe I had seen this place on the ever so awesome show Man Vs Food as well as America's best sandwiches. Of course I had to go here and try it right?! When we sat down and got the menu I saw that this place was more than just Tortas (Mexican style sandwiches). They had a very extensive menu. Oh man what the heck was I going to order with so many choices. I'm not a decisive person so when i get a huge menu it makes it really hard on me. Ugghhh! But wait this place has Torta in their name and every time I had seen them on TV it was a Torta the foodie celeb was eating so that was what I would order as well! I wasnt about to try the Man vs Food Torta called the Torta King Carlos V priced at over $20, but this is because it can feed a small village. Nope not for me. I would instead choose the other sandwich which came out in America's best sandwich list...the Torta Del Rey. The sandwich consisted of the following: Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, omelet, sausage and Mexican sausage come with tomato, onions, avocado, chipotle sauce, smear of refried beans and potatoes ruffles on the side. That sounds like a lot yumminess in between 2 pieces of bread. Wait how do they even fit all of that in a sandwich? They're joking right...Not at all! This thing is huge and just under $10...oh my! Whoever thought of this is a genius cause it tasted amazing! The only downfall is the thing is huge and hard to keep together. Gets quite messy for sure, but the experience is pleasurable throughout. Last of all the service was incredible. The host and waitresses would promptly come around frequently always making sure we were content. I would definitely return here and suggest anyone else do the same...just make sure you are feeling hungry!"}
{"text":"I always order the Del Rey torta and it is loaded with delicious meat. Amazing. This place has great tortas as well as quesadillas, burritos, and etc. If you want authentic Mexican food try this place. Not your typical cheesy and bean filled tex mex. Los Reyes has good quality and flavor along with great service."}
{"text":"Sat at table for almost 10 min before server came just for drinks.... then.... no beer!? What's Mexican food without Corona or Dos Equis?! Add no children plates and it was a bust... we left for another place. Soooo...FYI... not kid or alcohol friendly"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out ever since I saw it on Man Vs. Food. I finally got around to it since it was close to my new doctor's office. I ordered the Torta Del Rey and a papaya cremosa. The torta was exactly what I envisioned,  layers of meat goodness. The papaya cremosa was what really surprised me. Most boba places I frequent use powdered papaya flavor, but with this I could actually taste/ feel the bits of fresh papaya they used. I haven't had a good papaya drink in years and this is definitely one of the best ones I've ever had. They also have an extensive menu with items like burros, tacos and ceviche.  And the restaurant is actually bigger than it looks from the outside. I can't wait to come back to try out the other items!"}
{"text":"I got the torta Rey. I think it's called. It was good. There was a lot of meat. The taste didn't blow me out of the water, but I liked it.  It tasted authentic. It's not as Americanized."}
{"text":"Totally not what I was expecting but wow! So much flavor packed into my sandwich. This is one of my husband's favorite lunch spots. We will certainly be going back. I had leftovers and they were even good cold from the fridge he next day!"}
{"text":"Excellent sopas...liked the Tinga de pollo.  Chicken quesadilla was excellent too.  All homemade tortillas...yum.  The tortas were great, as wee the blended drinks!!"}
{"text":"Huge variety of torte's and other yummy Mexican dishes. Eating in-try the horaches, best ever. Last night we ordered pick up. Four adults so we ordered four different torte's, cut each into quarters and shared. The torte's are so big, I'm having left overs for breakfast. Service is always fast and friendly. Don't forget to try a fresh juice-always a wide variety."}
{"text":"I'm another Man vs Food follower and this place lived up to the hype! I don't usually order tortas at Mexican restaurants (too many soggy buns and mashed up flavors),  but after watching the show my wife and I had to hit this place up while visiting my family in Scottsdale. They have a HUGE menu to choose from and the four of us took forever to decide as they all sounded amazing. And....all four were! The atmosphere was pretty cool and we had good service, but when it comes down to it, we'd go back for the food even if everything else stunk. It was THAT good."}
{"text":"Delicious and inexpensive and in the part of town where I was at the time. The Man vs Food endorsement didn't hurt."}
{"text":"Dopest dope ever. Was so so good. I can't wait to come out here again nd get another torta  kuz I'm driving off nd I am wanting another one"}
{"text":"I flew into town and decided to head over for the famous los reyes torta.  I've been to the one on 7th st after it being on the food network.  Both have great torta, chips and salsa.  The menu is huge and the selection can satisfy anyones craving.  Great place to come hang out and have some authentic Mexican food.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Yelp has helped me discover so many incredible places recently and this is one of them! By far, this place lives up to its name \"The Kings of Tortas\" (translation for Los Reyes de la Tortas)!   Not only are the tortas spectacular, but the service is something you don't find very often! The host was incredibly happy and kind. I told her that this was my first time visiting the restaurant and she kindly walked me through the menu.   While I was waiting for my order another employee (I think he was the manager) asked the host if I had been helped. She said, \"yes, and it's her first time here\". I then asked him how spicy the red salsa on Torta Ahogada was, he said \"not very spicy\". Once my order Take-Out came out, he also brought out a free Torta Ahogada for me to take home! I was so grateful and shocked that he would give me a free torta just because I enquired about it! This is something that showed me how amazing their service was! They have gained a new lifetime happy customer!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Man v. Food website.  Definitely had to try it out.  Torta is huge.  We ordered Torta del Rey & shared it.  Great flavor.  Huaraches De Cameron was also very yummy.  Plenty of shrimp. Again we shared. Fresh made tortilla.  Delicious Okay so here's the downside... NO ALCOHOL!!! I don't know about you but when I eat Mexican food I like to enjoy a nice cold margarita.   My spouse wanted a beer.  Bummer. Would've been perfect.  Service was great.  Everyone very nice.  Food was hot and came out fast."}
{"text":"I've had really good breakfast burritos here before but lately, when ordering a breakfast burrito with sausage, the sausage looks like raw hot dogs. When I complained, I was told it was \"Mexican Sausage\". Just FYI. I won't be coming here anymore for breakfast burritos. The \"Hot Dog\" burritos are gross."}
{"text":"Great food and service for breakfast ... crazy good grilled veggies (onions and peppers) with ham, rice, beans and corn tortillas. Build you own breakfast taco with some nice grilled jalapeños to add if you want.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, both times I ordered one of their Tortas and both times I was definitely satisfied with my meal.  The first time was a few months ago and I tried the Tortas Del Rey; their signature torta.  This thing is absolutely HUGE!  Everything in the torta was cooked perfectly and the service was excellent.  The next time I ordered something new on the menu called the Torta Norteña. This torta has grilled steak, grilled onions, jalapenos, cheese, avocado and a mayo chipotle sauce that made the sandwich extremely tasty.  I am looking forward to the next time at Los Reyes, this food hits the mark!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, nothing spectacular about the food. I had a corn tortilla chicken quesadilla, it had the right amount of spice and flavor. I also got the Watermelon Aqua Fresca it was refreshing in the 100 plus  weather.   The service was why I gave the restaurant three stars. We had seven people in our group. We all ordered aqua Fresca's and it took over 10 minutes to get drinks to the table.  I never got the water I requested.  The food took a while as well and the waitress didn't really stop by to see if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"Well known for their tortas, of which I've had the famous Del Rey (ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, omelet, sausage, chorizo and all the fixings) I've also been there for their asada tacos. Served platter style, where you build your own, they're paired with refried beans and rice and is quite the serving size. Great spot for a heavy lunch, and their three locations (last I checked) seem to all be on par with consistency, which is great for their reputation."}
{"text":"Tasty dinner like I remember from Mexico. Waitress was very kind. I can just recommend."}
{"text":"Talk about the most underwhelming restaurant visit of the year. My boyfriend and I saw that this was mentioned on Man vs. Food and we're immediately intrigued as it is located so close to our house. (Afterwards we found out that the show was centered around a different location. Not sure if that would've made a difference)   Immediately, we were surprised that a Mexican restaurant did not serve alcohol. They had such a pretty drink menu but apparently they were nonalcoholic. So strange.  Then we ordered chips and queso but it ended up being queso fresco, which, was just strange.   We then ordered the tortas mentioned on the show and were severely underwhelmed. Most Mexican food is soaked in spices and this tasted SO bland and flavorless.   The servers were kind but I wouldn't return here as there are SO many other spots with better food than this."}
{"text":"Came here for the tortas. Tried the Cuban torta, pollo tacos, pollo burrito, and ceviche tostadas. Oh can't forget the wonderful watermelon Aguas frescas. The Cuban torta was ham and cheese with Chinese BBQ pork, it was good. The burrito although small for a burrito was filled with pollo, salsa, avocados, and beans. This was pretty good except for the size, I would consider this not big enough for a meal. The pollo tacos were ok, simple enough.  But the star of the meal and unexpected winner, which in retrospect probably eclipsed the other meal components was the shrimp ceviche tostada, we got two large and they were incredible. Spicy and fresh and savory.  I could have had two of these and maybe a shrimp coctel. Well I'm assuming the shrimp coctel is wonderful also. Need to come back and try more sea food at this wonderful place."}
{"text":"For what they advertise, they knock it out of the park with their Torta's.  I am sure there are places in Mexico that can rival them, but in the US I have yet to find a place that can rival the variety and fair prices of these tortas.  I ordered one of their new asada tortas served with salad and grilled peppers and freshly made salsa all was delicious.  The bread they use for the torta is really fresh and taste great.  love the avocados they use as well.  My wife ordered the first torta on the menu torta dela reyes filled with egg, chorizo, avocado, sausages, and pork slices.  Very filling torta for a great price, had left  overs for a filling breakfast the next morning."}
{"text":"!!!!!!!!!  THE BEST  !!!!! CEVICHE TOSTADA ALWAYS A GREAT CHOICE!! Maybe 3 !!!  All the tortas are bomb!!! Cannot say one bad thing about this place. Have been coming for a few years now and will keep on eating!!!  They have another spot on 43rd and Thomas area that we have tried as well and it's just as good!!"}
{"text":"Does another review even matter?  After Man vs Food, what more?  Food is good, but honestly there are other MX restaurants around that are just as good.  I find the meat to be on the greasy side and I'm not a big fan of hot dog in my torta, but overall I think they hold their own.  The people are really nice.  On the MX restaurant scale it s a 7.5 I'd say.  They serve no chips & salsa which I find odd, but actually they're doing me a favor as those are wasted calories."}
{"text":"Great tortas, agua frescas, and tacos! Id give it 5 stars but they don't have beer."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and cheap too.  Located anywhere else, this place would be asking triple for what they are charging...which is why I think this place is even more of a find and why its consistently busy.  You know it's good mexican food...when this is where the mexican's go to eat.  (And I don't mean that in any derogatory sense at all)   When you find authentic food in anywhere I can appreciate that.    Missing the 5th star because the parking is atrocious and surrounding businesses do not accommodate whatsoever.   Also no bar....which is not a bad thing I guess and maybe I sound like a lush, but I would have liked to have a drink or two with my meal.  Smoothies were ridiculously good though so no harm, no foul."}
{"text":"Top three Torta / Sandwich / Burger I have ever had. Trust me I'm north of 250 LBS. I have put down some food."}
{"text":"Its been years since i have been here and from what i remember it was amazing but just now i had takeout and it was just terrible! Carne asada torta very empty, meat was dry and hard to chew..not going back anytime soon"}
{"text":"It's now been a day later and I've finally awoken from my food coma to write this review.  I first saw this mentioned on Man vs. Food and figured if it was good enough for a food critic to give a thumbs up, it was worth a shot.  All four of us ordered the Torta del Rey but on the back of the menu I see this extra entry that says \"Extra meat on Torta $4\", so I ask the waitress if what Adam had gotten was a del Rey with extra meat to which she confirmed in the affirmative.  So that is what I order, my less adventurous companions all order just the regular del Rey.  15 minutes later this meat Juggernaut on a plate surrounded with Ruffles chips is before me.  This is the most massive thing I've ever seen and could definitely be a front runner for an eating competition.  The sandwich was about 8 inches long and would say about 5-6 inches high.  It towered over my coke can as I, my friends, the waitresses and many other customers came by to take pictures of this gargantuan meat monstrosity.  Everyone elses torta was cut in half, mine was sadly not but held together with two skewers.  All the layers of meat inside of the torta were succulent and delicious, the size did make for a bit less enjoyable experience since each bite had to be performed in a quadrant so all the available flavors could not be combined but were segmented.  I was probably good with only half the torta, which was about a pound, but goaded by everyone around I put on my Torta Warrior face and finished the other half much to everyone's amazement.  The chips don't seem to go well with the torta, would rather have had tortilla chips to dip in the salsas provided.  Overall a very inexpensive place to eat and for a little more you can probably feed two people off one sandwich.  A must experience for anyone in the north valley."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch by myself.  I was pleasantly greeted at the entrance and immediately seated at a nice window booth.  The restaurant is fairly spacious, clean and there seemed to be ample wait staff.  I was given complimentary chips and salsa and my order taken promptly.  I ordered the Cubana Torta with ham, pork sirloin, avocado, onions and peppers.  They offer quite a large number of tortas in a couple of sizes.  Plus Burros, Tacos, Quesadillas and some Seafood dishes.  The pork sirloin was well seasoned and sliced thin so it was very tender and complimented the ham.  Overall, the sandwich was tasty and filling.  The torta came with ruffles potato chips right out of the bag which seemed kind of odd.  Some type of \"Mexico City\" side dish would seem to be more appropriate.  Overall, very satisfied with the service and food.  I'll be back soon to try another Mexican sandwich."}
{"text":"It seriously doesn't get much better than this when it comes to Mexican cuisine in North-Central Phoenix.   After hearing about this place on Man Vs. Food (as I'm sure many others did), a bunch of us were inspired to try the Torta Del Rey during lunch one day. This thing is monstrous! The size is incredible, and the taste is out of this world! I ate half of it and had to take the rest with me to eat later in the day.   Other than the epic Torta Del Rey, this little restaurant is just one of those great hole-in-wall places that has the best food in the area. If you're in SunnySlope for the artwalk, stop by this place before-hand and see how far you can get into the King of the Tortas!"}
{"text":"Bomb tortas in town!!! I had the torts de milanesa and my husband had the carne asada plate. Good food good prices, great selection, Plus its been on Man vs Food!"}
{"text":"Get the king steak tacos freaking amazing. Best ever also the rice they give you is killer."}
{"text":"Well then,  time to update.    I've been back a couple times..     One thing to make note of:  the dare sandwich sucks.    They raised the price of it (because they can, I guess... which is a lame reason)  and it's really not a good thing to eat.     It's the sort of thing that might sound good if you're stoned past reason but I haven't been in that frame of mind in a decade or more,   and today even if I was I'd have the good sense to avoid dare sandwiches in general.   The rest of the tortas with balanced ingredient lists are still exceptional.      But the place really is a bit too busy,  so I'll probably not go back for a little while - it's not like Phoenix is short on great Mexican."}
{"text":"( This is 2 reviews in 1- by my husband and I. ) Los Reyes de la Torta was highly recommended to my husband and I by various family and friends. I personally was not impressed. I had La Reyna and with a piña smoothie.La torta was massive, very generous in proportion . I really liked the flavor of the chipotle sauce. They weren't very generous with the fries and they were stale . My pina smoothie I could tell it was made from real piña and other fruits but it tasted like when you eat fruit before it's ripe. On the other hand..... my husband ordered El Rey and La Niña fresa smoothie. His torta was massive as well and he said \" estos si son como las tortas de Mexico\" and that his smoothie was natural, He loved it! He wants to go back.I'd go but I would try something else on the menu ."}
{"text":"If u want delicious food and amazing aquas this is the place. Our server was polite and very helpful and made sure we enjoyed everything.Very nice atmosphere and everyone is so polite. And u have got to try the Torta Del Rey"}
{"text":"Delicious - they never fail.  Love their Tortas especially Carne Asada.   Wow yummy delicious"}
{"text":"I am going to repeat the EXACT words used when I took my first bite of food.....Stupid Good.  Yes that is the best I could pull out my expansive vocabulary.  This is, quite literally the best Mexican food I have had in my life.   I mean, most of the patrons of this fine establishment are Hispanic.  I always say, if the patrons of a restaurant match the ethnicity of the cuisine, EAT THERE!  The last thing I want to see in an Asian or Mexican or Thai restaurant is all white folk!!  I have been here several times, and nothing is bad. Even their home made juices are amazing. I constantly find myself ordering the V8.  I also love the Chorizo Fundito and the Massa Quesadilla is SOOOO GOOOD!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible. I've had Mexican food here in AZ, California, Chicago, Mexico and this place is the best. For the value you get an incredible meal that can feed the whole family. The torta must be 2-3lbs at least. It's huge! And under $8. WOW.  If you like authentic Mexican food from Mexico City and don't want to spend too much money this place is it."}
{"text":"Los Reyes De La Torta has great food and even better Torta sandwiches. I like to follow where Guy Fieri and Adam Richman go to eat. This restaurant i can now know why they would stop."}
{"text":"Mi esposo me llevo porque salieron en la tv que son las mejores tortas. Pero NO, están muy malas, no tienen sabor, te sirven exagerado nada antojable, fui con mucha expectativa desafortunadamente ver tantos ingredientes revueltos hizo que perdiera el apetito."}
{"text":"We went here last weekend, since the reviews were really good. We tried the shrimp cocktail which was good. We also got a burrito and tacos. Both lacked flavor. Nothing special. Only thing we enjoyed was the shrimp cocktail that is it. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Mind you - if my fiance could pick his last meal, it would be a torta - hands down.  Los Reyes de la Torta?    Overhyped and under delivered.  We ordered to go, so maybe if we actually ate there, it would've been better?  Regardless, that shouldn't be the case anyway.  The food was horrible.  We ordered the Tortas Del Rey.  The thing is huge, I'll give them that.  BUT it was DRY and lacked flavor.  It had all the bells and whistles.  Unfortunately, the last time I checked bells and whistles (as well as the kitchen sink) don't have flavor.  Neither did this torta.   My fiance is Mexican, and well- we know what a torta should taste like.  This was nowhere close to that.  Not even reaching substandard levels.    Came with chips.  It was to go, so why do they pack the chips in the same container with the hot torta.  Soggy chips!  Yeay, what a treat.    I ordered their king porkchop.  The spice was definitely there, but that was it.  Just a burning sensation in your mouth.  No other flavor.  The porkchop was dry as can be and severely overcooked.  It was like eating cardboard.  Rice and beans weren't seasoned.  Seriously?    And service?  Abysmal.  These girls working the front counter and \"serving\" have got a lot to learn.    What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Food is next level and you will want to come back. The only gripe is they don't serve alcohol, but u may bring your own."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Food Network and decided to stop by while we were in town for Spring Training.     Well I was not disappointed!! Arrived a little after the lunch rush and we were seated as soon as we got in th door. I order the Del Rey torta and it was more then emought foood... it was held together with two giant wooden skewers and came with two handfuls of ruffless chips.   The took our order and in less then 10 minutes our food was at our table.  We also were served  a red salsa that went get on top of the chips and torta..   There was a ton of meat on the torta and not your low quality stuff but good big sliced chunks of pork, nice and thin and lightly breaded milanesa..egg, chorizo, ham, sliced hot dogs, jalepenos, cheese, avocado, onion...etc etc....  The torta bread is some of the best I have had..  on the 2nd visit I had the Arizona and we started with the queso con chorizo and jalepenos toreados....  Torta was just as good as the one from two days before...  The queso con chorizo was enought for 3 people and they gave you quite a bit of chorizo too.  M only complaint would be the jalepenos...as they were not roasted long enough, out of the 6 we got only 3 were roasted the right way and the other three needed at leat 3 more minutes on the grill.... they were still raw and lacked that roasted taste...  But other thent that this place was legit.....  They havr a Monster 5+ pound torta called the King Carlos V.... during our 2nd visit two of them were ordered by another table and our waitress was kind enough to stop by our table to show it to us before dropping it off....  I thought my torts was huge  now this one was HUGE!!!   Will def be back  when ever I am in the Phoenix area"}
{"text":"Los Reyes is too awesome. first we went i had the Plato de Alambre de Camaron which is the grilled shrimp plate,and the Coctel de Cameron 'grande\"..  which is a large shrimp cocktail. soooo good i had to go back 2 days later and had the shrimp cocktail again and a grilled steack and onion burro. my girlfriend had a chicken torta.  it was hella good!!!! next time i go gonna try the tacos......"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The first time I went the lady was very nice and helpful and the Tortas that I got was very good. The second time the customer service wasn't as good,but the food was. Good food mediocre customer service"}
{"text":"I wanted tacos and decided on this place to satisfy my craving. I have tried the tortas but never anything else on the menu. I hate myself for waiting so long! We got a sandwich, tacos, and pork with beans and rice. Everything was fantastic. You really can't go wrong with ordering anything on the menu. Make sure to order an agua fresca. It's the drink of the gods!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing. This was the best service I have ever gotten! I almost felt like I was at a 5 star restaurant. This place was really clean and the food was the best I ever had. I will be coming here a lot more often from now on!"}
{"text":"Just like a lot of other people, I wanted to try this place out since I seen them on Man vs Food! Now they are on the Best Sandwich in America contest, I really wanted to see what this place was all about! I went there during my lunch hour, 1st thing is they got me in and out of there really fast! Service was very fast and very courteous. The only thing I did not like was when it got slow, all of the girls who works there, had nothing to do. So they all huddled together and started to chat! I pretty sure management would rather have them use their time better. I ordered their Reyes torta! Only because this was their iconic sandwich, it was pretty good! But for me it was just to much ingredients! I want to go back and just try a simple one item torta! The Reyes has beef, pork, ham, chorizo, eggs, hot dogs, etc.., I can just go on forever! Again, it was a good sandwich, but I am more of a simple sandwich person. Their salsa for their chips were awesome! Nothing I had before, great taste, with a little fire! I'll let you know how my second visit go's! But yes! If you have not tried this place, it's a must visit place!!"}
{"text":"OMG this food is amazing!!   This is a hole in the wall place in Sunny Slope. Staff is very very nice. Everyone you pass will smile and say hello and welcome.  Some reviews have said this place is dirty. I did not find this place to be dirty. It's in an aging structure and gets HIGH traffic. Floor are clean and they are fairly new tile.  This is a Mexican place and they do only place Mexican TV I say this because I know some people are bothered by this.  I how ever came for the food. Waiters all speak English very clearly.  I ordered the Torta Nortena. Meat was tender with a lot of flavor. Bread was soft and kept well with all the juice.  This was amazing!! So frickin good I want to go back today!  My Mother in Law ordered a tostada \"american\" style just beans and cheese.  The owner also brought her out on that is \"mexican\" style and gave it to her for free so she could try they difference.  Very NICE!  Portions are more then enough to make you full and you will leave still wanting more. Cost is suprisingly cheap for the portions and how wonderful the taste is. Menu is full of original dishes of their own making and every item has personality.    One of my new favorite places.  I have to drive about 20 min to get there but well worth it!"}
{"text":"For as much hype as this place got from my friends I was expecting some sort of flavor explosion to occur when I ate here. Instead what I got was a wait in a place with limited AC in AZ in the sumer for what was essentially a ton of different meats that weren't seasoned much thrown on a bun.   While the torta I got, the del-rey, wasn't bad it also wasn't fantastic. It tasted like what it was a hodge-podge of meats one would find in mexican food all thrown on a bun. It was hard to distinguish any significant flavors and the one I got the most was that of hot dogs.   I probably would have held this place up a bit higher if I hadn't gone to a torta place near work a few days later and had a very similar sandwich that actually had some distinct flavor and I didn't have to wait with little AC for it.  I might try this again if I lived closer but I am not driving out of my way for this."}
{"text":"I came here specifically for the Del Ray Torta. For getting five different types of meat, along with veggies and sauce, I was expecting better. There wasn't much of a flavor punch. Everything was very tame and washed out in distinction. The bread was decent and held up for the meal. The avocado was fresh and added a good amount of creaminess and moisture. Price wise, you're getting a good amount. I highly recommend splitting it."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp! Thank you!  Great food. Ordered the guac, a Torta mini, and a burro. Yum"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! Large menu with lots of options you won't be able to chose. I went with chicken tings sope and it was perfect. So many fun drink option- no alcohol served here but Agua Frescas of so many varieties. So many other things I wanted to try on the menu so we will be back soon"}
{"text":"Man vs food torta is money!! The restaurant looks sketchy from the outside but don't let that deter you, inside its nice and the food is always on point! Give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"After a trip to the Goodwill in this same parking lot, my tummy starts rumbling for lunch. It is 10:10am and my 4am breakfast is long gone. I look around and see a neon \"Open\" sign glowing from across the parking lot. The sign on the door says they open at 10am, so I hustle in and am immediately seated in a booth.   A basket of tortilla chips and a small bowl of salsa instantly appear and a smiling waitress takes my order promptly. I order a small chicken torta (less than $6). The chips were odd. Some tasted stale and like unsalted Fritos. Others tasted like over salted fresh tortilla shells. The salsa was watery and not to my taste. I can't quite put my finger on what was missing in it, but it tasted like tomato juice.   My torta arrived steaming hot with a side of potato chips. It seemed like carb overkill--tortilla chips, potato chips, and the bread in the sandwich. That said, I loved the toasted roll and the chicken. The tomato on the sandwich was pale with no taste.   The decor here is strange. I know that they have tried to turn an old JBs into a Mexican vibe eating place, but the painted walls were really bugging me. About half way through my sandwich I figured it out. They tried to make the walls in the dining area look like they had been stuccoed, but instead it looks like a bunch of 3 year olds had finger painted the wall with poo. Yech. Two walls had flat screen TVs on them, but with no volume and on different stations. Just as they were bringing my sandwich, someone switched on some Mexican polka music so loud that it startled me.   Would I eat here again. Probably not. If someone was just craving a torta would I mention this place? Yes, but only because I don't know of many torta places nearby."}
{"text":"This is the place for Tortas In Phoenix AZ  Always really constant with the every order, I seen it all I been going to this restaurant even before it became Los Reyes that was back in 2000 when I was barely 13 years old. This is more like my family restaurant even though they don't eat bread anymore. But it has a friendly atmosphere but in the last 3 years or so the service gone really slow and a bit rude I don't know why. But now I just order ToGo instead I love there food"}
{"text":"Awesome!  There are so many reviews here already for this location!  Here's my take on the visit, which occurred Saturday Jan 29.  After I convinced my 10year old that she might actually enjoy the unfamiliar (and get a fresh fruity drink), we stopped in at Los Reyes de la Torta for lunch.  We were seated quickly and a friendly young lady waited on us.  We needed a minute to look over the large selection of items, so she brought us water and gave us a couple minutes.  My daughter wouldn't order a torta, but said she'd try mine.  She selected a quesedilla with guac, and a Mango/Strawberry Aguas Cremosas, which is kinda like a lighter milk shake- not as heavy on the cream. The white cheese was melted and folded between a deliciously buttered and grilled flour tortilla.  Yum!  She enjoyed it, and the drink.  Based upon Rand's review, I ordered the \"Torta Norteña\" with salad.  Iced tea is fresh brewed and good.  The food arrived quickly and was plated beautifully.  This was truly the best Torta I have ever had.  The mix of ingredients was just right, and the bread was divine.  It was a little spicy for my daughter, but she loved the mix of flavors and suggested that the entire family come back for lunch next Saturday.    Servings are larges, so we took home 1/2 a Torta and a bunch of quesedilla, which were quickly consumed by a perpetually hungry teen, who now wants to go get her own Torta.  We enjoyed the atmosphere- lots of families, bustling and lots of energy.  Positive, happy crowd.  The restaurant is in an old-school strip center, but is clean and effort has been made to make the inside cheerful.  We watched some of the prep cooks working and I noted that they used proper safety/sanitation measures at all times.    I can't wait to go back and try some other variations.  My daughter is now a Torta convert."}
{"text":"My party of 3 adults and 3 kids ordered the chicken burro, red chicken enchilada, scrambled eggs with ham and a beef patty (?) we all cleaned our plates . Very friendly service. Clean interior. But their apple juice looked like diluted applesauce so my kids didn't finish theirs but we'd still return. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Come HUNGRY !!!! They have very nice and sweet servers here who are attentive and happy. Their portions are very large here so plan on having a to go box ( unless you're my husband ) The drinks are Incredible  but non-alcoholic , there is O'Douls for those who just gotta have that flavor with a meal. I had the biggest quesadilla I've ever seen , with machaca , and they have lots of other kinds of meat to choose from to put inside this cheese filled dream. Their horchata is so rich and creamy. And the bill was not even close to other places I've been to lately, which left me leaving a great tip for my server and still a feeling of satisfaction , which I can have again later tonight because I went home with a togo box !"}
{"text":"These guys are taking tortas in some bold new directions.  A slight nod to these sandwiches over those by other purveyors like Tortas el guero.    On a personal note:  Tortas to me are the Krispy Kremes of the sandwich world.  The first few bites are an incredible and unexplainable bliss but the last few are full of guilt and a prelude to an upset stomach.  Maybe that's why I always prefer the simplest tortas that don't overshadow the bread."}
{"text":"Have eaten at this place before and was quite satisfied, but this time the food was not as tasty as before.  Not sure if it was that it had to be delivered, which meant it was not hit and right out of the kitchen, but it was just different.  Will try again and hope to get a better result."}
{"text":"Got take out of a chicken sandwich with chipotle and a steak sandwich with avocado ....bread is really good and both tasted amazing.  Definately going back soon."}
{"text":"The prices were a bit steep, but the portions are humongous. My sister and I split a torta. The tortas were absolutely good, and juicy. The salsa was smokey and added much flavor the the sandwich. The fresh juices were delicious and portions were amazing. A definite jewel in Phoenix. Oh, I wish you branch out towards Los Angeles. (:"}
{"text":"After much prodding from a favorite client to try this place, my husband and I went on Saturday night.  We were seated right away and for being where it is,  it was pretty OK inside. Our waitress was very nice and attentive the whole meal. I had the king tacos ( client's recommendation) and they were Delicious, 3 soft tacos with really good chicken, I don't know what they marinate it in but moist,  flavorful and cooked to perfection, perfectly sauteed onions on top with just the right amount of cheese. I had the horchata and it was excellent. Husband had the Del Ray of course and it kinda grossed me out a bit but he enjoyed it, I had a bite and that was enough, it was huge so he took half home and enjoyed the rest for breakfast the next day, he also ordered a side of beans and they were really good and not your  typical refried beans,  they were a white bean with a little cheese on top, Yummy. he also had the vampiro to drink, it was beets and other veggies juiced and he loved it, it did look just like blood. all in all it was really good andwe will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch on a Sunday at noon.  Large restaurant with several rooms and a friendly efficient staff.  The restaurant is clean and brightly decorated and the restroom was more than adequate.  The wife ordered Torta norteña de res (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-reyes-de-la-torta-tempe#b5_syEe_0dULbFvnbUdd1w) and I had the Torta USA, very tasty and interesting mixed ingredient sandwiches, with different meats, cheese, grilled fresh pineapple, etc etc. Really packed full of fresh tastiness.  For dessert we had the flan which was just OK, a bit too dense but flavorful. If you want a Mexico City taste, this is the place."}
{"text":"Great food, great fresh drinks. Went there after seeing it on TV. Wasn't feeling up to the big Del Rey torta so ordered a regular one which was still great. Everything we had was good and we ordered 4 or 5 things to try."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a sandwich for lunch, and on the Mexican side of flavors, you're looking for Tortas. This place caught my eye when I was thinking of what to eat for lunch the next day since I was in town for a conference. I think this place is definitely a lunch spot and popular among locals as when we went we saw this place pretty packed. The tortas came out pretty fast and let me tell you, the tortas are big. If you get their signature sandwich, the Del Rey, you will get a surprise of a torta full of different types of meats. This restaurant was featured on Man vs Food, and they make it apparent as there's a huge encased poster on the side of the wall.   Let's get to what I thought of their tortas. I got the Del Principe. Why did I not go all out for the Del Rey, their signature torta? When I read it on the menu, it just seems that there were so many flavors in the torta that it just would conflict with each other. I definitely wished that they offered a Al Pastor torta, but to my sadness I was disappointed that there wasn't one on the menu. So, ultimately what caught my eye was the Del Principe  which was easier to make sense as far as what they put in the sandwich. And I was correct when the sandwiches came out, as my other colleagues got a different sandwich I got to check out the Del Rey torta. That thing was massive, but for me it was nice and manageable.   I wouldn't say that this torta was the best I've ever had, as I've had some amazing rotas. I was just a little saddened that they did not offer an Al Pastor as one of the options of meats. However, for what they have and their twist on tortas and style I definitely recommend it if you're interested in trying something new. If you want a ton of flavors all at once I definitely recommend the Del Rey torta, however if you're looking for something simple where you can enjoy it, check the Del Principe out and see what you think. Sadly, I went restaurant hopping so I went to different places every day of the week so I didn't get to try out the other options. I definitely recommend here for lunch and tortas!"}
{"text":"Had the shrimp plate. Really very good. went back a second time and was very disappointed.  I don't remember the reason.  but I'll go again."}
{"text":"Yet another place I would never have found without Christina P and Yelp!  And it was good.  Really good!  The menu has quite a few recognizable items like burros and tacos, but I opted to try a huarache, basically an over-sized tostada with a thicker, softer corn tortilla and you choose your toppings.  Let's just say it's 8:16 am and I wish I were eating one right now.    They don't serve alcohol, but they do have a great juice bar with many options to choose from.  Of course, that won't satisfy anyone who can't fathom the idea of a spicy meal without a beer or margarita.  But it worked for me.  I will definitely come back if I'm in the neighborhood.  I just need to find a reason to be in the neighborhood now."}
{"text":"I admit, I came to Los Reyes de la Torta because I saw it on Man vs. Food and the sandwiches looked awesome. Unfortunately, I did not have the stomach space to partake in the del rey, but I was able to enjoy the milanesa and a giant agua fresca.  My milanesa was great - loved the fresh bread and the thinly battered beef. I forgot what the bf had, but his was even better because it was more saucey. Beware of the free salsa because they are both SPICY!!  I think even better than the torta was the agua fresca. I had the fresa cremosa - strawberry milk and it was amazing! Oh yeah and they have Mexican cokes in bottles too.   The parking lot is a bit small, but there was a guy guiding people on where to park. He was really nice and told us not to park in the neighboring lot or we would get towed."}
{"text":"Wow! Super tender, fresh, perfectly cooked carne asada on a toasted out of the world delicious torta! I cannot wait to go back! Authentic as it gets, decent service and amazing food! They didn't serve alcohol during lunch despite the margarita signs everywhere, but who cares?!? This place will make your taste buds happy, but beware you can get addicted on the first visit like me.  The service can be horrible, but I almost don't care."}
{"text":"Not quite as good as the main location, but still kicks ass!  My only critique is that they don't serve a complimentary chunky salsa along with their hot salsa.    Get the agua fresca, try an appetizer (we like the queso dip w mushrooms) and finish with one of the many Torta options they have.    Personally, I love anything with steak at Los Reyes.  If they cook it fresh, it's incredible and very authentic!  My wife had the steak fajita plate thing and I had the steak Torta.  Her steak was obviously fresher and hotter.. Absolutely delicious!!!  Mine was warm, but not quite as freshly cooked.  Still tasty as hell, but I wish they were more consistent.  They have some cool fresh fruit options here.  Both in the agua fresca and in their dessert options.  Not too pricy either!  NOTE:  The main location was featured on Man vs Food (Food Network),  Adam had the loaded Torta (forgot the name but you'll see it!)"}
{"text":"This Place is not to be missed! Yes you will feel about ten pounds heavier than when you first came in but trust me it is worth it. You have never tasted anything like their Tortas in your life! Staff is friendly and helpful. Prices are reasonable. It's a Best Of Phoenix kind of place!"}
{"text":"The habanero salsa is so good. They also have these mini ceviche tostadas for .99 and they are really good. The torta milaneza ( breaded strips of tenderized beef) is my fave. All of their juices are really good too! Speaking spanish is a plus when it comes to ordering."}
{"text":"The tortas were really good... we've been here before, this time we got a USA and Del Ray.  One torta easily feeds 2 pretty hungry adults.  We did have one issue - last time we went here I'd ordered a steak quesadilla, and it came with beans on it.  So this time when we ordered a steak quesadilla we explicitly requested no beans on it.  This was for a 'to go' order and the person who took the order over the phone assured us there were no beans on the steak quesadilla but made note of it anyway.  when we got home..there were beans on the steak quesadilla.  My daughter and I cannot stand the texture of beans, so that made the steak quesadilla inedible for anyone in my family.  I called to talk to the manager, but it was during dinner rush and he was unable to come to the phone.. so I sent a message via their email contact.    as I said, fortunately the tortas as easily big enough to feed a few people each, so we split tortas and everyone was full...    but why beans on a steak quesadilla?"}
{"text":"The hubby loved his torta, I wasn't impressed with the burrito I ordered the only good thing about it was the green chile on top of it."}
{"text":"This is truly an immersion into real Mexican food. The inside is not fancy with eclectic art or artifacts from Mexican history. There is no alcohol served here. Imagine that, dinner without booze!   The preparation and plate displays nothing but authenticity. It is not located in a great neighborhood and those stuck up Biff and Erma from their high ended plot need not venture here. This is for real down to earth people that accept all cultures.  Our meals were excellent and the price just right. Don't worry, they do speak English if that was your concern. A very family driven establishment. We will be back soon! #vinosquared #vino2 #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"We drove all the way from California to eat here and we were not disappointed! This was on our bucket list because of the Man vs Food episode. We ordered La Torta Del Rey and one was enough for both of us! They serve you fresh chips and salsa to start off and it was pretty good! I ordered the horchata to drink and it was soooooo delicious! It was definitely fresh and home made unlike other Mexican restaurants that use nasty mix! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good! I've been here twice now, the first time I got the torta norteña de pollo and this last time I got the norteña con carne asada.  I like the chicken a little better.  The chocolate flan is pretty darn good as well.  Great authentic mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Steak Torta I have ever had!! The waitress recommended it:-) My husband had the Beef burro which was also excellent! Portions are very large, service is great & nice atmosphere. They do not service alcohol and wishing they did."}
{"text":"Whenever I have a craving for Mexican Food, this place satisfies.  Been eating here like 3-4 times in the last week.  The only downfall is that the food will slow you down for a few hours afterward but is worth it sometimes.  Dishes I love this week: plato de asada, beef burro (big burrito), lunch asada with rice and beans.  All fabulous!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Very convenient location to my home. Love their torta's, however the fact that they come with ruffle chips is a little strange. On some of the larger tortas you could probably get away with splitting the meal, or bringing it home with you. Salsa is spicier than many other Americanized mexican food restaurants, which is an added plus.  At the end of the meal they give you a dum dum lollipop. Only gripe would be the fact that their margaritas are non alcoholic. They should really splurge on getting that liquor license."}
{"text":"I actually liked the atmosphere of this quaint divey restaurant.  It reminded me of my 20s when I used to go to mexico for the day, or even for the weekend.  Growing up in San Diego, the border was a quick 10-15 minute drive.  We came here because it was featured on a television show.  The thing to order was the Del Ray Torta.  So we ordered that and the King Steak Tacos.  I thought the Del Ray was ok.  Each of the meats in it were tasty in its own right, BUT there was too much going on.  Like a pretty girl overly made up or like if you got all flavors of ice cream and blended it all together.  Tastes and looks good but not distinctive.  I took a few bites, was like..OK..yea.. um, sure..its good..another bite..hmph..nod.. I guess i was really trying to like it.  Now the King Steak tacos Suprised me!  A little on the greasy side, they were tasty and filling, with a price that was pretty decent for the amount of food on my plate.  I finished every last bite!  Service was indifferent.  Neither friendly nor unfriendly; They were there to do their job, which they did efficiently.  It was pretty busy, but things came out at a timely manner.  I don't think any of the waitresses eat the food here.  Every single one of them were in great shape, even the older ones.  I was envious.  I would return to try out another torta, and perhaps one of their delicious looking drinks."}
{"text":"So low carbin' is all Ive been talking about lately and Im working on creating a new list with my recommendations.   It might seem like a taco/torta shop is the last place you can low carb but Los Reyes is exceptional, especially on the cheap! Order the Tacos Alambre de Res ($4.75) and have them hold the tortillas.. so what you get is a plate full of chopped beef, onions, bacon all covered in melted cheese served with shredded cabbage, sliced radishes, sliced cucumbers, grilled onion and a grilled jalapeno. Slather on some salsa and don't eat the grilled onion and you've got yourself some good eating right there!"}
{"text":"A co-worker suggested getting food from here and I'm usually pretty skeptical about places I've never tried but I decided to trust the yelp ratings and give it a shot.  I have to start by saying their delivery service, AZ Delivery 2U, was horrible.  My order confirmation said my food would be here \"ASAP (12:17PM).\"  The driver came in at 12:35PM.  It was hard to get information out of them.  When I called all I got was \"oh, it always takes an hour.\"  If that's the case they should put an hour as the ETA on their confirmations in my opinion.  But I digress.  This review is about the food.  Our lunch was fantastic!  Thankfully still piping hot when the driver (finally) got here.  I had a chicken burrito and it was freaking delicious.  I always have to customize my orders because I'm such a picky eater and my order was exactly the way I asked for it.  My co-worker got a torta and that thing was insane.  It had ham, cheese, an omelet, even a hot dog on it!  He said it was ridiculously good.  I wish this place wasn't so far from work.  I would absolutely get food from here again but certainly not for delivery."}
{"text":"Made the trek to this unassuming place after watching Man vs. Food showcasing the restaraunt. Hubby and I couldn't resist the temptation of the humongous tortas on the tv. After a studying the menu for quite some time, I ordered the Arizona torta along with a Pina Colada drink. Figured this should fill me somewhat.  The Olympics were on tv, which garnered most of my attention, until the food arrived. It probably took ten minutes or so for the waitress to return to our table with our glorious, fancy, fruit decorated drinks and a moundful of torta goodness. One bite of the sandwich= instant fan. The sandwiches are really large, so even half was enough. I will definitely be back. Next time, I will try the chilaquiles with eggs and steak...mmmm"}
{"text":"Authentic mexican food the kind of place you bring someone from out of town to show them what it's all about. The drinks are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Very crowded on a weekday lunch and I can see why! Largest quesadillas I have ever seen.  Loved the corn tortillas. The burrito in enchilada sauce was also good but smaller than the quesadilla! I ate half of the del rey torta and it was good but the chips that accompany are boring. The tres leches could also be better. Next time I want to try one of the fruity drinks."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I were there last night for dinner & we both got food poisoning! He had the Hawaiian Torta and I had the \"vegetarian\" dish mushroom tacos. Poor guy got sick worse than me, maybe because he had the meat. I won't go into the gross details, but he was up all night in the bathroom \"standing\" AND \"sitting\" on the toilet. The only thing we had in common in our meals was the complimentary chips/salsa, onions in both our meals & we both ordered a horchata. Place is filthy! Waste of $30!"}
{"text":"So yummy! Friendly and fast delivery, food was hot and delicious :) definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Everyone around here has a different 'favorite' Mexican restaurant and this is mine. Good vegetarian selection. The portions are big, like a lot of Mexican places, so you'll probably have leftovers for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, generous portions, super friendly and fast service. I love this place! The menu is huge. Get the horchata, it's delicious."}
{"text":"I keep coming back!   Latest obsession is the shredded shrimp quesadilla. Apparently, there's some sort of translation problem because \"shredded\" means \"with onions and bell peppers.\" In addition to onions and bell peppers -- and shrimp, obviously -- the ginormous quesadilla is filled with cheese, guacamole and smokey, bacony beans!   So good!   P.S. When I was there yesterday I noticed a sign that Man Vs. Food was there to eat the torta. Episode airs next week, I think..."}
{"text":"I can still taste the Lime. Mexico at its finest & the food has a fresh taste, the portions are eatable, and the drinks are HUGE. I enjoyed the good...and as a family of five..everyone left there satisfied and full. Very tasty food."}
{"text":"had the Arizona Torta it was pretty good, but i wish they had fries not chips.."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and the service was great, there was no delay and our server was very nice. Had shrimp tacos which were awesome and they have many other items on the menu I look forward to trying the next time. Great location and it had a good crowd of professionals, the price wasn't shocking either. I will recommend!"}
{"text":"Got the nachos at the insistence of my coworkers. They gave this place phenomenal ratings. I wasn't dissatisfied but wasn't overly impressed either, I've had better and far worse also."}
{"text":"Our group of 7 were seated quickly on a Saturday night. This was our second visit. Our food was tasty and hot. Chips and salsa were not complimentary, but flavor of food hits beyond the spot...meaning our entrees exceeded everyone's expectations. We were all very satisfied with our meals. I had a mini USA Torta, on which I had added an over easy egg. The toasted roll for this tasty Mexican sandwich was excellent and the salsas were spicy and flavorful. Milly was our server and took excellent care of us throughout our visit. We will return again, as soon and often as we can."}
{"text":"The best shrimp ceviche I have had so far. The tortas are great. Loving the tacos, the best one in my opinion is the beef. Tried lengua and cabeza tacos, they're good, I ended up adding more salt. Aquas frescas are very refreshing."}
{"text":"Come hungry.  Really hungry.   The fact that Adam of Man v. Food fame came here to eat should tell you something.  You can feed an entire family of four for like 20 bucks.  The tortas are loaded with protein and even come with lays ruffle potato chips.  They have ceviche tostadas and bebidas liquidos (mango is an all time fave) but you can get something that is healthier involving beets and vegetables which looks cool but tastes like sweetened v8.  It is super busy, happy families, hungry locals, a tv in the corner that is usually playing soccer or some variety show.  Old School Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Very authentic, you can tell how good the food is by just seeing not only the amount of clientele, but the kind (90% Latino). Everything I've tried has been fantastic"}
{"text":"The tortas were so delish, kids enjoyed the mango agua fresca. Would def go back if I visit the area again."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gawd. I am so fortunate to live just up the hill from this place...YUM! We heard rave reviews about Los Reyes and couldn't wait to try it. It far exceeded all of our expectations! Everything was spot on...friendly staff, good fast service, huge portions of delicious food, and very reasonable prices. I had the shrimp taco plate and my friends had the Norteno Pollo and Mexicana tortas. Wow, it was nearly orgasmic! The aguas frescas are delicious as well! Good job guys, I wish you much success you certainly deserve it!  pt. 2...5th visit and took my son this time. he got the carne asada torta & i had the chicken tacos. yummmmmo! couldn't even finish our plates it was so much food - ate the rest for dinner lol. drop whatever you're doing and go eat here NOW!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great value! Food is fresh and made to order. The staff is friendly and fast. Without a doubt I will be returning. The torta norteña is my favorite. My husband had the torta dell rey and it was also amazing. The smoothies are fresh and refreshing. A great lunch option after a hike on North Mountain....the torta bread is fresh and made in-house. Truly authentic tortas!"}
{"text":"Cheese. Melty, gooey, cheese. The queso fundito was so good. All the food we had was great and fresh. No one in my group had a torta, so I hope to try one next time."}
{"text":"Yay!  I'm still a fan and I think this Torta is \"As good as it Get's!! If your craving a really tasty torta, Mexican sammich, you can not beat Los Reyes De La Torta, aka the Mexican Sammich King!!   The shrimp ceviche is DELISH!!  They have a super duper salads also for a great app or as a meal.  But it's the torta's that I come here for!!  Yes they have loads of other things on their menu you can choose from if your not a torta kinda person, but then I would ask; \"why are you here?  Seriously?\"  :-)  The Torta Del Rey is crazy tasy but ginormous!!  You better have a HUGE appetite or plan to share this with a friend.  They still throw everything on this bad boy but the kitchen sink : -)  I would also suggest their Ranchera de pollo o res with either grilled chicken or steak, guac, fresh cheese, chopped onion & cilantro & a chipotle dressing.  or their Nortena de pollo o res with either grilled chicken or steak, onions & jalapenos with chipotle sauce, melted cheese, refried beans, tomato, avocado.    It's all good at Los Reyes De La Torta!!  I hope you give them a try if you haven't already!!  I'm looking forward to my next visit so I can try their new torta, King Carlos V.  It looks AWESOME!! I hope to see you there."}
{"text":"Is our first time here with my hubby, and we are definitely coming back. The menu is huge, they have a lot of options for everybody. The food is amazing! We got the Principe torta (pork sandwich) and a chicken corn tortilla, both were really good. Also got Mango agua fresca (mango juice), delicious!!!  Tony was our server and he was attentive, nice and really has knowledge of the menu, his recomentadions were spot on. Prices are fair. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Awesome tortas! Great flavors and plenty of options. Fair prices. Decor is nothing to write home about but you're not there for the ambience. The food is the star.  A must try when you are in Phoenix. Place is always busy!  In the Sunnyslope area which is a little seedy but don't let that stop you.  They have another location in S. Phoenix too."}
{"text":"This place is Bomb.com/org lol highly recommend this place if you want some chip and salsa that actually has some flavor and spice :) good ambiance and great service,  let's not forget the authentic Mexican flavor!"}
{"text":"Omg the chorizo con papa quesadilla is the best thing I've had in a long time!!! It's bitter sweet could eat it everyday but not good for the body!!! Mm mm mmmm"}
{"text":"*drooooooooool* i LOVE these tortas! so tasty! they're not suuuuuper cheap, but i believe they are worth their price. and man, i love a place that doesn't skimp on the avocados! the creamy salsa that they give you with the tortas is killer. so spicy, smoky, and so delish! things can get a bit greasy... but nothing too heinous. the steak they use is thick, juicy, and tender.   try the agua frescas con crema - like an orange julius! a giant, fresh, delicious, non-powder-mix orange julius. all of the aguas here are huuuuuuuuuuuuuge! i have this thing for papaya - which tastes just like the fruit, so it's not super sweet, but it IS incredibly refreshing.  parking kinda stinks, as the parking lot should have been re-paved 10 years ago, and i don't think people look when they back out of their spots. but who cares? these tortas are worth the trouble.  *edit* ate here again just last week - and let me tell you. 5 stars! literally EVERYTHING on this menu rocks. mmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Food here ranges from the delicious to the absurd.  If it reads like a gimmick, it probably is so be warned.  On my most recent trip I tried the del Rey - my goodness, what a heaping pile of meat.  There was egg, pork, cheese, ham, chorizo, some kind of hot dog, avocado and who knows what else.  I dumped their salsa on top (delicious!) and experienced pleasure through about half the sandwich, then very quickly reached a threshold and now I probably won't be able to eat a torta or any kind of processed meat for about a month without curling up into ball and sobbing.  In past trips I've chosen smaller, less ambitious items and made it through the visit purely in the pleasure zone.  Outside of the entrées, another reason we come here is the aquas frescas -  again, a bit gimmicky in that they are humongous, super sweet and come decked out with garnishes and umbrellas and such.  But they are quite delicious and great to share -- only problem is the wife always orders the regular, and I prefer them with sweetened condensed milk..."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!  And I didn't have to don my formals, either!  No items are bad here, and cheap too."}
{"text":"Jackie was a wonderful server and the food was really awesome. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Food is priced accordingly for a casino. It tasted ok but what really got me was that after I dropped 10ish dollars for a meal they refused to give me salsa unless I gave them a few more cents. So then I did and it was like an ounce of their sauce. They didn't charge when they first opened. Their customer service is also a bit poor.  Ill stay away from this one..."}
{"text":"I'm Mexican and I came here to eat and was really disappointed. I ordered two tortas that looked more like sandwiches. On the menu they looked full of meat so I thought paying 9.00 for a tortas and a side of bag potatoe chips was not too bad. But what we received was two tortas with barely any meat. We ordered carne asada and rice for the kids and the food was bland and they didn't even eat it all. Very disappointed, this restaurant might of started off well but I will definitely not be coming back. I feel the food is bad and over priced."}
{"text":"This place is so busy. But absolutely worth the wait. The atmosphere is great and the food is even better! I love getting the Ceviche tostadas for everyone as an appetizer, then everyone orders their food. Once we've all ordered we get our food not too long after that. The staff is always so kind and servers are very accommodating."}
{"text":"Had the torta ahogada and had my eyes opened to an entirely new world of sandwich. It's a brilliant idea and one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten. The sauce it's drowned in is slightly spicy and very savory.  The beef inside is tender and perfectly seasoned. Try one of the first chance you get because you are going to LOVE it!"}
{"text":"The good, the bad, and the ok....  On our way to see a spring training game at Maryvale stadium, we decided to check this place out after reading some reviews and rather than pay $10 bucks for a burger we thought it was a good idea. The reviews were mostly good and the prices listed online seemed reasonable. We thought to get burritos. I'd decided before we left the house.  The menu online had prices from $5.75-$6.25. They do not have a working website, so what I found turned out to be dated information. What it turned out to cost, you might ask..? Two burrito's for $20 bucks. Well, $19 bucks. So that was a bit of a surprise. Parking is tricky and the back lot is in rough shape. But it was packed so that seemed a good sign.  If taking to-go I recommend calling ahead to avoid a wait, which wasn't long however. The place was packed, mostly with families. Another good sign.  The service was prompt and friendly.  My gf had the pierna, and I got the bistec. Large and heavy burrito and goodies that came on the side included shredded lettuce, cucumber, radish, a roasted jalapeno, roasted onion slices, lime wedge and salsa. Good value still but more pricey than I expected so really nothing to complain about.  I didn't try the pierna but my girl enjoyed it. I 'mostly' enjoyed mine except for one MAJOR drawback. Nearly half of the steak in my burrito was grisel, fat and connective tissue....so that was not a gratifying experience. Whomever trimmed the steak did a poor job. That said it was very flavorful and filling.  I would return but try another item..."}
{"text":"Man vs. food!ridiculous sandwiches, but NO ALCOHOL and can be a long wait on the weekends, but everyone should try it out for sure!"}
{"text":"Come here if you want amazing Mexican food for a reasonable price. We always get the shrimp ceviche, shrimp burrito, and quesadilla estillo del Rey. Everyone we've ever taken here says \"That's the best burrito I've ever had.\" And it seriously is. Try it."}
{"text":"We love their food but hate there soda service. No fountain drinks here. Just glass bottles or cans. So there for no free refills. There best dish is the King Tacos w/steak . They are always busy. I would have giving them 5 stars but the soda thing is a star buster for us."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out ever since Adam from man vs. Food showcased it. The building is huge and very open and updated.  We were sat pretty quickly although the hostess was m.i.a. for 5 minutes or so.   The menu is HUGE and a little daunting if you don't know what some of the items are. I started out with the chaquito ceviche which was really good and the perfect size. We ordered the pancho via torta and both the Carne asada and pork belly tacos. The full size torta is insanely large, honestly big enough for two people. The Carne asada tacos were very very good, not dry like most places.  The pork belly was decent but lacked in flavor.  Overall the food was a hit, and once the waitress took the order, the food came out quickly.  The kitchen was very efficient.  The downfall of this place is the service. Slow is an understatement and I think it's because they are very understaffed.  Everyone was friendly but water refills rarely occurred and when it was time for the check, the waitress disappeared for 15 minutes!    Bottom line, if you're not in a hurry and willing to sacrifice service for good food, you've got the spot."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Man Vs. Food and had read all the yelp reviews about this place. I was expecting a good meal, and it was descent, but I wouldn't say it is 5 or even 4 stars. The food was ok. I split a chicken quesadilla and ranchero beef torta. The quesadilla really can't even be called a quesadilla, there was barely any cheese on it. The torta was ok, but it seemed dry to me. The meat seemed cooked ok, but it wasn't of the best quality. It wasn't too expensive, so that's a plus. Overall, I just thought it was mediocre. Nothing too special."}
{"text":"Large portion, great service!  Try it and you will like it!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and I can say with extreme confidence that these are the greatest Tortas in Arizona, if not, the entire southwest! Life-changing food !!"}
{"text":"Well, we were quite lucky to find this place. In the Phoenix area for our annual Spring Training trip. One in the group said \"I want Mexican.\" Jumped on Yelp and found Los Reyes. 4.5 stars with a boatload of reviews is great. Did not catch the Man v. Food references so that was a pleasant surprise when we arrived (being the food show junkie that I am). Actually tried the same torta that was featured on the show (split 4 ways ... 5 lbs is a lot of torta). I am a torta purist and the the hodge podge was a bit much but in general, tasty. That appetizer was great! Probably would be a 5 out of 5 if I had ordered a more traditional torta ... Who am I kidding, if I am in the area, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wonder if this place is in \"the square\".  If not I imagine this so called square to be similar which I envision as a place where everyday people live.  With all that said the food was excellent and authentic.  Surprised not more of these place in Phoenix.  Great wet burrito and nice selection of tortas.  Mine was excellent with grilled onions a smear of retried beans and a touch of some spicy bite inside.  Service was good and attentive but we did get seated by the ice room.  High traffic with workers walking in and out but it doesn't really matter.  My son and I will be back!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food with a super homey feel then this is your place. Awesome staff! Tony was super friendly and super personable it felt like I was being served by one of my own friends. They have an fantastic selection as well. I had the Tacos Azteca because how often do you get to try cactus? It was pretty damn  good. Great texture and had a lightly sour taste so it goes great with the side of beans and the house hot sauce. Here's the kicker; BYOB! They don't serve alcohol but they make delicious virgin drinks that you could spice up with some Tito's or Jose Cuervo. I think it's a huge plus that they let you byob! It's cheaper and you get to bring exactly what you want. Will not be my last time. LOVE IT."}
{"text":"We went here for a nighttime snack. Everything we ordered was really good and the staff is very friendly.  We will definitely be going back the next time we have a nighttime craving!"}
{"text":"Hello again. Today we had the green chicken enchiladas, tinga tostada and a machete de alambre de pollo. Bombness!!!! Salsas are on point. Every thing tasted fresh and delishes. Only one set back.... My chicken in my enchiladas was hard. Imagine chicken left overs from the fridge left open. The top layer that gets hard is what seemed to be served.  But still 5 stars for their great service and delicious menu. It was my wifes first time and she loved it. Their aguas are freshly made, not like the other restaurants that sometimes have old foam dried on the plastic container that ironicly is suppose to cycle the bevarege. For authentic fresh mexican food and drinks i highlt recommend los reyes del la torta"}
{"text":"The best authentic Mexican Food in Tempe!   I ordered the shrimp ceviche Tostadas and the Carne Asada Quesadilla de Maiz with Green sauce and cream.  Absolutely delicious!  This is a little hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Los Reyes de la Torta for a couple of years with my coworkers for lunch and I have enjoyed every meal.  Their menu is huge with many different variations of burritos, quesadillas, tacos and much more.  I typically get a burrito that comes with steak, jalapeños, beans, onions and I ask for no avocado or cilantro. They have always been flavorful, hot, fresh and a bit spicy.  My co-workers get the quesadillas, other burritos and taco and they have always enjoyed their food.  They are always on point with flavor, consistency, service and even during lunch you can find a table or two.  I look forward to next time."}
{"text":"Tortas!!! This place has bomb tortas. I usually go with chicken since I like the leaner meats, but I've tried a few other styles and they're all good. They also have fresh beverages with fruit, horchata, and various sodas."}
{"text":"BEST tortas EVERRRR!!!!!  Nortena- steak- no avocado, no jalapeños, no chipotle sauce & extra chipotle mayo & hot sauce...... I promise you will fall in love!!!!!"}
{"text":"Heard about this fantastic place and have gotten several orders to go probably 5 times now. I have ordered for myself the cubano torta which is the best torta I've ever had; it is so flavorful with a slow heat from the jalepenos, but the cheese and avacados pleasantly calm the spicy flavors all encompassed in a bread that holds the sandwich together. The pork is not salty and I don't have the heart to try any other sandwich! Several colleagues have ordered the quesadillos, del ray torta (holy giant sandwich) as well as the platillos and I've yet to hear a bad comment. The mango agua frescas are also exceptional, so refreshing! After I move from Phoenix, this will be all I remember from here!! Must try and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Wonderful salsas, terrific portion sizes and awesome dessert! I have been there three times now and have no intention on stopping! One of the most friendly waiters I've ever had at ANY restaurant, the place was absolutely swamped (I went there on a Saturday evening at 6:30) but the food came out quick with zero mistakes, same with the desert. Completely awesome place!"}
{"text":"Definitely the King of the Tortas. I love this place, great tortas and aqua frescas.   It was featured on Man vs Food a couple of years ago, mainly on the reputation of their Torta del Rey, an enormous sandwich generally enough for 2 meals for me. The torta milanese is great as is the shrimp tostada. Parking can be problematic at peak lunch and dinner hours (it's in a smallish strip mall). They do take phone orders for take out."}
{"text":"To start, we were served some complementary chips and salsa but the chips to salty... The horchata I order I returned it because it was just not right, it tasted just like whole milk( it's supposed to be rice milk!!) .... We order the quesadilla and a torta the food is def overpriced and it is missing a lot of flavor, the charge you extra for everything like more salsa or even limes!! .... But I should say that the waitress was very nice, so in conclusion the service was great but the food is not good"}
{"text":"In a city shrouded in the darkness of a lack of authentic Mexican food Los Reyes de la Torta is a beacon of light, hope and free freshly made chips.   It's big and clean - great place for families. It's kind of unique because places this good and authentic are usually dirty little hole-in-the-wall-shopping-plaza-restaurants. But this place is in a free standing building with plenty of seating and booths!   They have free chips and salsa. It's spicy salsa too. Clearly not made for white people. Also, my family were the only white people in there at the time. So ya know it's good.   Service was great. Plenty of parking. Oh and the menu is HUGE. it's kind of overwhelming but they have vegetarian and fish options, so it's a great place for pescatarians."}
{"text":"I finally made it here.  I love the feel of the restaurant (family owned, local).  You know those one of the kind places.  Went on a Friday night, it was packed but my friends got a table already.  We sat next to the area they made all the yummy shakes, so we had to speak a tad bit louder to hear each other.    I ordered the:  Arizona Torta -  Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef and eggs.  I had HIGH HIGH hopes with all the excellent reviews.  OH, it was ok, all the meats were bland.  The ruffles chips served with it, just did not flow."}
{"text":"Was looking for lunch place while waiting for our car to get serviced. This popped up on Yelp.  Ordered steak nortena -- it was fabulous! It came with cukes, radish, lettuce, grilled jalapeños on the side.  Ordered horchata as well. Delicious! We will return if we are around this area of Phoenix again."}
{"text":"I took my 2 gringo friends here and they LOVED it. Great food for the price and they are eager to go back. We called in the order for lunch and they had it ready to go. Tortas were delicious and very close to my beautiful place of origin Mexico City. The only con was that we were in a food coma right after after all of the amazing food."}
{"text":"No alcohol served!!! Selection of tortas is unmatched. Good service. If you're brave enough to try the Del Rey better not eat breakfast. I hope I don't get the gout."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch on our way home from Mesa to North Phoenix after I got off of work. We decided to travel on the city streets instead of traveling on the 60 to the 101 like we normally do Monday through Friday. This restaurant is a sweet, hidden oasis on Southern Ave in Tempe. Their style of cooking is original, old Mexican style. It was delicious! Every bite a mouth watering delight of just the right spicy goodness with a mild touch of heat. I ordered the shrimp tacos with salad and my husband ordered the green chili chicken enchiladas. His meal came with white rice with vegetables tucked inside. Every bite was absolutely amazing. In addition, I ordered a raspberry iced tea--that was sweetened naturally. It was cold and refreshing-just the way I like it.  If you're in the area, I would suggest looking this restaurant up. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time with some friends on a Saturday night. The restaurant is very busy. Man vs. Food came here to film an episode a few years back. I ordered shrimp tacos (Tacos de Camaron) and my husband ordered the Torta Del Rey (Mexican Sandwich) for which this restaurant is known for. We ordered ice tea and for dessert we ordered the flan. Every dish was excellent, prepared with the freshest ingredients. The portions were the right size and every bite was tasty.  The service was  excellent and the waitress was friendly. Our table was cleared quickly and our ice tea was always refilled.  I recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for healthy and fresh Mexican food."}
{"text":"Ugh, why did I wait 15 years to go here? First I had to avoid eating the chips and salsa, which were good, but not why I came here. I had the Del Rey -- ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, omelet, sausage and Mexican sausage come with tomato, onions, avocado, chipotle sauce and a \"smear\" of refried beans. Unbelievably tasty, just a little bit of heat. A wonderful brioche-type bun. Phenomenal taste and a helluva value at $9.99, especially since I could only eat half in one sitting. LEFTOVERS!!!"}
{"text":"My grandma lives like 3 blocks away and i had no idea man vs. food had been here i know a lot of places are way too hyped up to be on the show but this one makes perfect sense. I was extremely shockingly surprised.  I did not come in to sit down and get the full on experience but some day i can promise you i will be back again to get the amazing Del ray torta. Like the past review by JT M. I am kind of glad i do not live very close to my grandma otherwise that would make me gain an extra 15-20 lbs at least probably.   Before i ordered i was seriously contemplating all these crazy items together in one sandwich trying to figure out if all these things would be good together. But i took the chance and am pleasantly happy with my decision and so is my boyfriend as well.  He would sneak bites when i brought it over to his friends and was like \"theirs a hot dog in here!\" i was like weird ya i know. But its all perfect together. I cannot wait to go back to try all the different agua frescas flavors. especially the horchata because that is my personal favorite. All i know at this time is the food is amazing and i cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"One Star for the food.    Service=ABSOLUTELY HORRRRRIBLE I KID YOU NOT!  I am sorry but when the first time i go in to place a to go order for our office and it takes them over an hour to process our order and get it to us and only offer us \"NICE WATER\"(??????) I just thought to myself thats all you could do was offer us water??? It would be one thing if we were there to sit down and eat and had no time crunch to get food.  We are used to getting huge orders from taquitos jaliscos in like 30 min or less.  I didnt get any kind of apologies or anything from the managers walking around. Can we say unprofessional?    So our second visit my BIRTHDAY.  We had a waitress with so much attitude she could make a room feel tense.  I will never return to this place after the stupid B****es wanted to eye down my mom like we had to be rushed out the door to leave just because the waitress' shift was over with. To top it off they didn't do anything like bring a dessert for my bday or anything. Not like that's the reason for my visit all I want is good food a decent enough service. If you can't provide both or 1.5 of those things bring me a dessert NAO!  I will stick to going to the phoenix location from now on.  Tempe location I hope you go out of business because of the horrendous service. It makes me so disgusted."}
{"text":"Cheese Fundu - AMAZING!! I had a steak sandwich and it didnt wow me. Cheese Fundu- AMAZING!!! Because of this dish alone I would go back. The King Colada was also great..However, when you're thinking about where to go eat...this place a \"Cheat Day\" place. Unless of course you are working on a muffin top, then hell you should eat here everyday. Im just saying.. healthy.. this place is not!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.   Got the smothered carne asada burrito and the pork belly street tacos. Both were really good. The portions are generous, the food is cheap and the place was much cleaner than I expected it to be.   Would come back and try some of the other stuff.....the Tortas looked awesome (and huge)."}
{"text":"I was excited to try out this new restaurant since I saw the signs go up a few weeks ago.  I've heard such good things from the other locations and saw them on man vs food.  Unfortunately like a lot of other reviewers I found the service to be sub par.  The waitress did not know many very basic questions about the menu.  I'm OK with a learning curve with this being a new restaurant but everything I asked she had to go ask someone else about.  It didn't seem she knew much about the menu.  I also felt their was a language gap as her English phrasing came across harsh and rude.  If I knew Spanish I feel the entire experience might have been better.  The food came in a reasonable amount of time and everyone enjoyed their meal.  The price was very reasonable.  Overall my only complaint was the service but I'll give them some time to iron out the service and I will come back again."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said already?  Excellent food.  The service is actually quite slow- they have not scaled up to keep up with the recent demand.  But this is one of the few places where the quality of the food can truly make up for the sub-par service.  Prices are also rock bottom.  Can't wait for them to open up the Tempe store because Phoenix is a real hike for us from Gilbert."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant, good selection of food items, food served at correct temperature, clean and nice staff.... what more can I say?"}
{"text":"Nice, busy restaurant. Went in around 8pm on a Friday. Tortas are yummy. Menu is varied and quite extensive. Although i'm sure this place is popular because it was featured on man v. food. Food is made to order and didn't take too long to get to our table. Also had the Ceviche tostada... pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"AMAZING, AUTHENTIC, DELICIOUS. We were craving authentic mexican food This was it! Food was perfect, service was great. We will be going there quite often. LOVED IT!!!!"}
{"text":"$30.00! For what? Bad service, bad food and NO Alcohol. Asked for a Margarita but they only come virgin style, so had a coke husband had a water, we both had a glorified taco and $30.00 later. Waiter was rude and racist, had to ask a busser for our drinks because he never came back to table. So I know he did not like serving American Indians, Hell he probably is not even legal to work here. BAD!!!!!! place."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a couple of friends that suggested this location. The food here is based on Mexico City food. I ordered the chicken enchilada plate. It came with 3 enchiladas and a scoop of rice. It was a pretty good amount of food. The place actually has one torta that was seen on Man vs. Food. The red sauce had a slight kick but was very good. The rice was good as well but a little dry. I also ordered a pineapple fresca agua. That was really good."}
{"text":"I love this place and recommend it to everyone who will listen.  The tortas are so big you will likely have left overs for later that night.  The Hawaiian tacos are excellent as well.  Their red sauce is really good and I always have to request extra.   In order to get 5 stars a place has to have great food, good service, consistency, and be priced well.  This place passes each test."}
{"text":"While I can't bring myself to give Los Reyes a full 4 stars, I can't say this place doesn't deserve the mad bum rush of hipsters who are flocking to it. Apparently some show came here, ate a torta, and now everyone decides that tortas are THE thing to eat.  The good: - well, they build the right kind of torta. Not your flimsy bolillo, Los Reyes uses teleras which we all know is the only way to build a torta.  - AMAZING milanesa. How amazing? I don't even LIKE milanesa but it was ridiculously good.  - huge plates. By huge, I mean Goliath would eat one of these plates and definitely get the 'itis.   The bad: - weak horchata. It's not homemade. Well, they might make it but it tastes like the pre-packaged kind.  - Carne asada torta is not made with arrachera. If you're going to give me cecina, tell me. Don't call it arrachera and give me tough steak.  - location. Where in the world is this place? I was in Phoenix? I might as well drive to Gilbert. No, nevermind, no one wants to drive to Gilbert. - no alcohol. Don't advertise a margarita and then tell me afterwards that it's alcohol free.   I always start out with 5 stars. I took one off for them messing up my order (I asked for no avocado and they gave me extra avocado), and one off because the carne asada steak wasn't so great. It should be half of one but blame yelp.   Will I be back? Whenever my little aztec warrior princess stomach needs milanesa, I might just drive up here for it. It's that good."}
{"text":"I'm here and I was excited to eat a sandwich from man vs food the Del Rey the moment I bit into it was nice and juicy I decided to smother it with the green and red hot sauce along with some valentina hot sauce it was now nice n spicy. And a river of flavor busted in my mouth I was able to polish off the full sandwich and then you also and eat a burrito enchilada this time I was very full and I call to check it was cheap as hell if  you're on a budget and you want to eat lots of food come here its fun to take a picture at the front of the store to show that you been to a Man vs food stop"}
{"text":"Went to Mexico just a few days back before visiting this gem. While in Mexico was eager to try there tortas. I was able to try a torta ahogada and was disappointed with the overall taste and quality. Don't know if it was just the restaurant we decided to choose upon but it wasn't good. Fast forward a day back and was willing to try another torta place. And boy did this restaurant deliver! The tortas were just what I expected and had enough amount of meat as they pile loads of it on. The gf had the king torta while I had the queen. Though ironic both tortas  had both of us feeling full. Five stars would of been great but the waitress paid no regard to us only refilling our drinks twice. Overall food was good and not to mention the drinks were stellar (gf had the strawberry margarita and I freshly made mango juice) Will definitely try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Let's get to the good stuff, first... the chips were good.  My experience peaked there.  It certainly is a matter of taste, but the hot sauce they served with the chips, I found particularly disappointing.  Was looking forward to a good salsa, and I don't mean to play the definition game, but the sauce wasn't salsa...perhaps blame it on my American upbringing.  I ordered the enchilada's with the green sauce, and rice.  Again, may be personal taste, but I did not like the taste of the rice at all; totally could be \"real\" Mexican, but didn't dance well with my taste buds.  The enchiladas were bland, thankfully I still had some hot sauce from the chips to pour them.  What kind of ANY restaurant can last these days without serving alcohol?  What kind of ANY Mexican restaurant can survive these days without serving beer and a good margarita.  Knowing that a significant percentage of revenues for restaurants come from liquor and not the food, curious to know how long this place will last...  Anyway, for me, I was very disappointed.  Had gone there while I am in the area visiting because of the close proximity to where I'm staying and the reviews here on Yelp, but this time, wish I had gone with TravelAdvisor instead!"}
{"text":"1. Best horchata in the US.  2. great service, I'd go back just for the smiling faces. 3. with all that good stuff to say, even better food. We got an assortment. Everything was delicious. thank you."}
{"text":"Being originally from Mexico I am biased when it comes to Mexican food. I had heard great things about this place but I have to tell you I was disappointed. Service was very friendly and courteous.  Menu looked fantastic in the descriptions and pictures of the food.  We ordered Tortas....Flavors were good but the portions for the cheese and meat were skimped on and filled with the extras to make it look bigger.  I would rather see you charge couple bucks more and add more chicken cheese and avocado."}
{"text":"So amazing! I grew up on my grandmother's authentic Mexican food, and this is a close second. We have been here multiple times and every time it's delicious and staff is friendly. Free chips and delicious homemade salsa. Will definitely be back, again and again."}
{"text":"When everyone in this place is Hispanic, and we are the only Caucasians in the place we figured this has to be authentic! The food was great! The service was great! And they serve COKE, not pepsi so that is always a huge thumbs up. I had the USA Torta, which is like a sandwich, breaded chicken, ham, pineapple and cheese with a chipotle sauce, lots of food and very good...I took 1/2 home!   I had passed this place 100 times recently and the parking lot seemed always busy. We love Mexican food so I was hesitant since I remember being a kid and going to this place when it was JB's for breakfast with my grandmother. Place was great, and will for sure back to try something else."}
{"text":"Delicious tortas, quick and friendly service, nice and clean location.  I'm holding on to the 5th star for now until I try more of the tortas. I may even have to dig into that Carlos V at some point if I work up a serious appetite one of these days. But this was quite a first experience and is easily a 4-star restaurant for me.  I came alone and was immediately seated. I was brought a basket of chips (kinda stale, not the greatest chips anyway) and salsa (nice and spicy, good flavor) to enjoy while I looked at the menu and waited for my entree.  The menu is extensive! There are a ton of different tortas to order (although I must admit that some of them seemed to be rather redundant), and there are other, non-tortas options as well. But with how delicious the tortas are, I'm not sure that I'll ever move on to the other options.  I ended up ordering El Principe with grilled chicken. It came out pretty quickly, and it was nice and hot. It was served with a small salad of lettuce, radishes, cucumbers, a charred chunk of onion, and a delicious broiled pepper. I dug into the salad and added some of the extra green salsa they brought with my sandwich. Then I dug into the sandwich. It was downright messy--grilled onions and chicken were falling all over my hands and plate. I added some salsa to several of the bites for some extra flavor, but it didn't need it. The chicken was nice and tender, the onions were soft and nicely charred, and the cheese, guacamole, and sauce all made for a great combination. The bolillo was very soft and tasty. All in all, this was an excellent sandwich!  The service was great throughout. I was acknowledged immediately when I walked in the door, even though the hostess had just left to seat somebody else. A guy in the kitchen saw me through the kitchen window and told me that somebody would be right with me. My server was very attentive and friendly as well.  I'll definitely be back, and if a few of the other tortas match this first one, I'll end up bumping my rating up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"So we decided to be adventerous and wake up and take a road trip to Phoenix!!  Yes on a whim sometimes is the best way to experience places.  So we arrive in Phoenix, what is there to eat!!!    We decided to yelp and find something local and this place popped up.  At first we thought, Tortas....hmm, but after reading a few reviews and realized that M v. F Nation was there, we said we have to try this place.    Where to begin...these sandwiches are HUGE.....Definitely enough to share with someone.  WIth many choices and options, we chose the Los Reynas, and we have to say it was delicious......It was just a huge yummy sandwich that was flavorful.  The draw back was it just came with some chips.  Would have been nice with something a bit different, but still a great sandwich.    Bite after bite, this sandwich seemed like it never would end, but thats good so long as its flavorful.  And this surely was flavorful. The nice thing was thanks to yelpers we found this place so next time we are in PHX, definitely a place to stop by and try."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican places. I've been passing by this place for about 8 months, on the way home, before checking it out.  Yelp helped get us in the door, but the very friendly service and awesome authentic and tasty food is what has us coming back.  We'll definitely be back again, and my wife is actually not a big Mexican food fan, but she likes this one."}
{"text":"Never mind! We waited and were finally seated. It took them forever to come to our table and take our order so we decided to leave. The staff wasn't too friendly or social. It's too bad, I was looking forward to tasting one of their sandwiches ( Torta )"}
{"text":"First time here and all i can say is that i liked it a lot...  We were driven here after watching the show Man vs Food.  The Torta del Rey is awesome and huge...  The Mango \"agua fresca\" wasnt that good due that the mango wasnt in season so it was a bit sour...  Service from the waitress was excellent..  In general, its the most mexican like food i've tasted here in AZ..."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years. The food is excellent period. The reason for the 3 stars is recently the prices have gone up and portion size has gone down. One of the reasons i like Mexican food is you get a plate of food for a reasonable price. Now i look at my plate and think \"you just got ripped off.\""}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place because it was close to my old job. It looks questionable from the outside, but it is far from that inside. I am not a fan of Mexican burritos because something about the tortilla ruins it. This places has the most delicious Asada burrito which comes with beans, pico de Gallo, cheese, & avocado inside. They also give a side of cucumber & roasted onion/jalepeño, with lettuce. The burrito has so much flavor! It also doesn't get greasy and make the tortilla soggy. The customer service is always excellent. I love it so much that I haven't tried other things on the menu, but I will."}
{"text":"At first I missed it since its in this teeny strip mall type thing south of Hatcher. The little parking lot was full so I decided to chance the Wireless Phone store next door, parking at the end, completly ignoring the tow away zone. Living on the dangerous side - that's me! LOL  When I walked in, it was PACKED. Sunday 300pm, guess everyone came in after church. I was quickly greeted by a waitress and asked for here or to go. I ordered out and got the Alambre De Res. I asked her how many tacos come in it and was told an order of three. Only when I got home to find two corn tortillas hiding under the mound of beef. Anyway, as I was standing there to pay, another waitress was handing over these two fruit things, the nosey person I am quickly asked what is that because it looked delicious. She called it a Fruit with Whip Cream, apparently it had sour cream and pecans in it to. So I ordered the Strawberry one as well.  As it was just to crowded for me, I stepped out side, eating my Fruit Cream and waited for my order to appear. I was told it would take 10-15mins which I was fine with because of the crowd it was understandable. After about 5mins I realized it started to get hot and I stepped back inside and grabbed a seat and proceeded to people watch.  There was one waitress who's sole purpose was to answer the phone, taking to go orders and packing them up as they were ready. Another one stood at the cash register and accepted all payments. I saw a man there not dressed in the pink shirt and khaki pants, perhaps the Manager? He would talk with the waiteresses, pointing out things that they quickly addressed. Just made sure everything was running smoothly.  As I waited, I munched on the Fruit Cup - delicious! It had chunks of strawberries and pieces of pecans. Almost like yogurt. When I finally got my order home, and opened the box it just looked delicious...only missing one corn toritlla. What I liked about the meal is that it had a huge wedge of grilled onion and chili, so I could take a bite of that with the tacos. Grilled veggies are the best! The \"salad\" I didn't bother with, I think it was shredded lettuce, could've been cabbage, but since I didn't touch it, I'm not sure. Beans would've been a better side. I munched on the slices of cucumber and radishes that accompanied it. The meat was delicious with the melted cheese on top and with the salsa - a delicious meal it made!  Oh. And all these reviews about it being a sketchy/scary area. Umm..not really..  6/1/14 Update: This visit I got the Mexican Pizza in the appetizer section - delicious! I also got the Alambre De Cameron (Shrimp Tacos) SO GOOD! Filled with shrimp, topped with melting cheese. I didn't want the \"salad\" that usually comes with it and asked for beans instead. Welll...they gave me double serving of rice. BUT! It wasn't the typical Spanish Rice that I do NOT under any circumstances like. It had corn, bell peppers and NO hint of tomato sauce anywhere. YUM!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down a hidden gem!! We had the \"El Principe\" and \"Milanesa de res\" tortas, and boy were they good! We also had the michelada and agua de horchata. I wish I would've gotten the michelada. It was the best tasting michelada I've had! And it's non-alcoholic. Throughout the whole dinner I couldn't believe that a non-alcoholic michelada could taste so good! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice and very great service. The food choices were perfect. We had a group of 6 people and everyone had different food. Will be back tomorrow to get something different. This is must stop."}
{"text":"Only the best place ever! Lots of food given, and fresh! The agua de sandia was AMAZING! Whenever i am bavk in Phoenix,  will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We went to Los Reyes de la Torta last weekend for the first time. I was excited about the food, but wondered if it would be difficult to order and about the standards of cleanliness.   Both concerns were completely unfounded. The staff there were English-speaking and very friendly. The place appeared to be quite clean, too!   We ordered two agua frescas. One was mango and the other was cantaloupe/watermelon on the waitress' recommendation. Wow! Both were so fresh and delicious. Not too sweet, either.   Our sandwiches were the del Rey and the Arizona. They were both huge and served on some really good sandwich buns. I just couldn't believe my eyes when I saw all the stuff they squeezed into both sandwiches! Ham, pork sirloin, chorizo, sausage, egg, avocado, jalapenos, breaded beef-- probably some things I'm forgetting.   Somehow the flavors meld together to create the most savory combination with just a little heat. I had to stop after eating half my sammy due to threat of gastric explosion. Hubby ate the entire del Rey. Guess skinny guys must have a hollow leg where they put giant meals.   I loved my meal. It's the kind of thing you'd see on \"thisiswhyyourefat.com\" but soooooo worth it. We will be going back and plan to blow our out-of-town guests' minds with this place next time they visit! I forgot to mention our meal was less than $30 including tip."}
{"text":"We've been on an Asian cuisine kick lately and decided it was time to revisit Los Reyes.  It was 6:30pm by the time we arrived.  For a Saturday eve, it was fairly empty.  New menu with same items only slightly higher prices.  I ordered the Ranchera Torta with refried beans and hubby had Milanese de pollo with refried beans.  Both were good but I was not keen on the Mexican cheese.  It was not melted and very mild.  We both thought that the excellent taste was off that day.  I would go back to the Noteña Torta as that has melted cheese.  We were somewhat disappointed but will try again in the future.  Another visit to Los Reyes.  It was later than our usual hour for eating and a bit more crowded. There were still three or four tables left. Hubby was hungry tonight and decided to splurge on the Del Rey Torta.  I stuck with my order of Norteña Torta.  Why ruin a good thing?  The Del Rey is huge.  Be hungry if you order this.  He finished half of the torta.  He was very satisfied with his hearty meal especially since he can have the other half later.  The Torta is so big it eventually falls apart.  Here is where the fork and knife come in handy.  The bread is slightly toasted and very soft.  Perfect for the Torta.  Staff are very nice  and efficient.  They recognize us by now.  Prices are good.  It seemed noisier than usual with the TV blasting and the crowd of people in the place.  No matter.  We still love it here.  We officially change our rating to 5 stars because the food is so consistently good.  There was more of a mixture in clientele tonight as well.  The word must have gotten out.  Parking is somewhat limited but there is a lot."}
{"text":"Found out about this place from the Travel Channel and Adam's show about Best Sandwich in America. Tried the Torta del Rey and was very satisfied. Will be eating here again!"}
{"text":"This place has the best papaya shake and awesome tortas. Boyfriend had the carne asada plate which he enjoyed very much. I ordered one of the tortas and i cant remember the name but was really good. The firt time i visited this place i had a shrimp coctail which was also very very good."}
{"text":"This is a real Mexican restaurant specializing  in cuisine from the Mexico City region.  The food is authentic and delicious. The staff is great. You know it is real because it is always full of people who really know their food. Not wanna-be's. The chips and salsa are home made and the dishes presented in simple elegance. Here you can step into Mexico without ever leaving home. Los Reyes De La Torta is our 1st choice for Mexican in PHX metro."}
{"text":"Worlds Worst Frijoles. I ordered a small side of rice and beans for my toddler. How can you mess that up? The beans came out looking like soupy sewage mess, plus tasted funky. The rice resembled something from a frozen package. Truly disgusting. My burrito was the same quality. I returned the food, paid for my drink, and left to find some good Mexican! Manager also didn't acknowledge the situation at all. When I approached him he just stared at me and said nothing."}
{"text":"My wife wanted me to take her here because she saw them on Man vs. Food. We enjoyed the food. I would recommend the El Rey torta. I've been here twice. On my second visit, the service was a bit slower. When I asked if I could replace the potato chips with my torta for beans and rice I was told that it could not be done. Kind of a bummer but not a deterrent. The servers are nice. I like the back ground music because It reminds me of the times I have visited my family in Mexico City."}
{"text":"Holy crap, these are massive sandwiches.  On the recommendation of my boss (who very obviously saw this on Man vs Food, despite his denials), I made my way over to this place to try one of their tortas.  The bread is fantastic.  Light, super soft, hearty enough to hold the sandwich together, crusty enough to give you a nice grip, while it doesn't bring much in flavor or texture, it absorbs so much of the flavors of the ingredients.  Usually a negative for me when the bread doesn't serve a bigger role, but when there is so much going on otherwise, I'll make an exception here.  I love the breaded beef.  The meat is super tender and there's a lot of flavor coming from either the breading or the beef (can't tell).  Also, the mexican sausage (not sure if it's just the chorizo) is good spicy.  In the portions they use relative to everything else, it balances out, but you get these nuggets of real heat - much appreciated.  I do wish the house guacamole had a bit more heat it to it, because as is, it acts more as a palette cooler.  Also... fried egg on a sandwich - not new, but  there's something super breakfasty about it in these tortas.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but there was a nagging feeling that I was eating breakfast.  Not that there's anything wrong with breakfast for lunch or dinner.  Ambiance inside is very casual and relaxed.  Wait staff weren't the friendliest and I often felt like I was waiting for them to finish their personal conversations.  Food came up fast.  Already looking forward to many future visits and many future tortas."}
{"text":"So it goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway), the tortas at LRDLT are enormous.  Like ridiculously large portions for the price.  The bread is soft.  They're piled super high.  The ham is sliced thick.  The breaded beef has a spicy kick to it.  The omelet (and yes... let's just call it an omelet) somehow makes it all come together.  And keep napkins nearby before you start because all the avocado and sauce and beans will get all over the place.  The tortas - I usually go with the Del Rey or the Reyna , just for the kitchen sink level variety of stuff they shove it.  Is it breakfast?  Is it lunch?  Is it dinner?  Yes!  All the tortas come with a more than generous side of Ruffles.  A few times when I've ordered a torta takeout, it's felt like they handed me a lunch sack with half a Costco-sized bag of them.  Service was solid and friendly although it's always been pretty busy every time I've been here.  Wait times go by fast though.  And now, I can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"\"OK, that kicked ass!\"  This is the only sentence I could manage after leaving Los Reyes de la Torta.  The food coma was quickly rendering me incoherent...  This place well, does kick ass.  ¡Muy auténtico!  Salsa music in the background and soccer on the TVs.  An extensive menu with portions that seem to only come in one size - ginormous.    We thought we were being so smart by sharing two items.  Yeah, right.  There was enough deliciousness to feed a small family.  Mango juice... served in a chalice with a big slice o' mango riding on the side.  Shrimp quesadilla... I had no idea that tortillas could be made in that size.  Torta Del Rey... Easily more than 5\" tall and packed with just about everyting that their kitchen can prepare.  I would love to see someone try to bite into this.  We had to eat it with a fork.  Amusing that the torta is served with potato chips - who has the stomach real estate left to eat those!?  The only thing you can do after a meal like that is crash on the nearest couch until you feel human again.  I will be hungry again sometime late next week.  ¡Ay, lo me Encanta!"}
{"text":"This is authentic Hispanic food. They even had a dish my husband and I ate in Honduras. The rice is white rice with carrots and corn instead of the red rice served a lot of other places. I had the torta del Rey- it was delicious! T"}
{"text":"Typically, I rate 5 parts of the restaurant including food (of course), but today I will only rate the food because truly, nothing else matters. (Having said that, the rating would be lower due to ambiance, cleanliness, etc.)   I have moved from AZ to FL. NO ONE here understands what Sazon is, nor what real Mexican flavors taste like. The blend of spice, acidity, sweet, and sour turns the food at Los Reyes into works of art for the mouth. I have NEVER had Tortas that taste so flavorful and I've been around authentic Mexican food for over 30 years.   How I miss you!..."}
{"text":"This place is....ok.  The service was great but the food was...meh.  Absolutely no liquor is served here.  No margueritas, no Carona, Pacifico.nothing.  So, if you wanna go so you can see what man vs food saw, then go.  I must need glasses."}
{"text":"Real good! Bunch of beers on tap. Brisket tacos, carnitas both awesome. I thought we only had this kind of Mexican feed in Arizona. Place is clean and nice, and nice lady's working there as well."}
{"text":"Okay, okay, I didn't get it and now I do. After our first experience, my husband returned and had the torta. He claims it is the BEST sandwich he has ever had--this is a big deal for my DH because he loves a great burger, but he LOVES these tortas. So I decided I had to try this place again, and I am so glad I did. We have ordered tortas to-go several times, and they are great every time."}
{"text":"The best food I have ever put in my face .  We had shrimp ceviche tostada, shrimp tacos, and a shrimp dinner plate .   Words do not describe this. It's that's good ."}
{"text":"Well, I don't think I'm \"super cool\" for liking this place, but I guess I am \"totally down with the hole in the wall places in the hood.\" Just playing Samantha O. :)  Really though, I think Los Reyes de la Torta is fantastic! I went last week for the first time in about a year and I forgot how good it is. All I've had so far is the Torta Nortena (with the steak, not chicken) and the steak tacos. Both were incredible, especially the Torta Nortena, which has grilled steak, onion, jalapenos, melted cheese, chipotle, tomato, avocado, and chipotle mayo. It's huge and it's fucking awesome.   I haven't had a burrito here yet, but after seeing what the patrons at the next table had, it's on my to-do list. The burritos were about the size of my forearm and looked delicious. Los Reyes de la Torta may be famous for their King Torta seen on Man Vs Food, but to be honest I'd never get that one. It has way too many kinds of meat and it's total overkill. But hey that's me, maybe you'll like it. Eat this sandwich in under 15 minutes and it's free.  In case this video hasn't been posted already, check out the 2 minute clip of Man Vs Food at Los Reyes de la Torta here:  http://www.travelchannel.com/video/a-sandwich-fit-for-a-king-11276"}
{"text":"Awesome. Went here for dinner with the family. Found this place in the Phoenix Magazine top Ten best Mexican food places & I can see why. The service was great. & the torta I had was amazing."}
{"text":"This is the perfect lunch spot -great service, delicious food and (virgin) drinks, and food comes quick!  This place is walking distance from my apartment and I've been hearing how tasty it  is for a while. My boyfriend and I finally decided to go last week. We were served tortilla chips and fresh salsa when we arrived and I ordered a watermelon agua fresca. It came out quickly and was so delicious. It's a perfect refreshing drink for a hot summer day.  I ordered the nortena de pollo and it was awesome! The bread is warm, light, soft with a light crunch. The chicken, cheese, and toppings were great! I loved it!  My boyfriend ordered the del principe with steak. It has basically the same ingredients as the nortena de pollo but with a thick slice of cold Mexican cheese. He wasn't a huge fan of the cold cheese on the warm torta, but I thought it was tasty. For newbies to authentic Mexican food, just realize the Mexican cheese will be a cold thick slice and the melted cheese is obviously warm and melted.   We definitely plan on coming back and trying more tortas. Check this place out"}
{"text":"Had the chorizo quesadilla which was fantastic. My buddy had the shrimp tacos which he said were delicious. Customer service was good. Very authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time my daughter and I tried the Mexican food here. And I've got to say, this is possibly the best Mexican food that I ever have eaten outside of Mexico. Everything was fresh and well prepared and the service was excellent! My daughter had vegetable quesadilla, which was packed with vegetables and yummy cheese. I tried the shrimp cocktail that was  flavorful, delicious and fresh.  I would highly recommend that everyone try this restaurant for a truly enjoyable dining experience.  This is a hidden gem and we will certainly be coming back!  Dine local!!!"}
{"text":"After waiting 20 minutes to have our order taken, an additional 15 minutes to get our water, another 15 minutes after that to get our food, and then 20 minutes after we finished eating to get our check, I was way less than pleased with the service. My boyfriend got the torta del rey ~ the rubber \"hot dogs\" in it ruined it for me. It also smelled weird. Too much going on maybe? Ick! Glad I didn't order it! I got the carne asade burrito instead. Which actually means bean burrito with a few tiny pieces carne asade mixed in. That was really annoying. The beans did taste good though. Over all extremely unimpressed with this place. Maybe we went on a bad day, but neither of us think we'll be back to find out. Bummer!"}
{"text":"If Dagwood Bumstead was Mexican, the Torta Del Rey would be his sandwich of choice. It has ham, cheese, pork sirloin, milanesa, sausage, chorizo, eggs, avocado, jalapenos, onions and tomato (hold for me). Whew! All of that comes on a soft telera with a side of fries, plus chips and salsa for around $9. Sound like a deal? It gets better because it's enough for two meals. I ate the first half for lunch at the restaurant and the second half for dinner at my hotel in El Paso, some 430 miles later. The second time around was even better - the sandwich ingredients had all that time to intermingle, kind of like a day old burrito. Yum.  And be sure to get extra tomatillo salsa. It's the one that comes with the torta, not the salsa they serve with the chips. One taste and you'll want to drink the stuff straight from the bowl!"}
{"text":"OMG!! I cannot tell you how many Mexican restaurants I have been to. This is by far TOP 5!! Came here while on vacation in late March. This immediately became the breakfast, lunch, and dinner \"GO TO\" place while there. Their sauces, although not spicy, had great flavor. Their fresh squeezed juices are Bomb! Had chilaquiles and the quesadilla del Rey. Bomb! Super delish! Family had other dishes.  Cant think of them now but they were NOT disappointed.  Liquados were tasty.  Everything tasted home made. If I go back to Phoenix one day, I will for sure stop by. And may I say.... their coffee is to DIE FOR!!! YUM! I would fly out there just for a good ole \"DE LA OLLA\" cup of coffee.   Just an FYI.... all alcoholic drinks are actually non-alcoholic."}
{"text":"Who would have thought Arizona would have such yummy Mexican food ? I am from California and it is pretty tough competition. This place was my first dinner in town and it did not dissapoint! I ordered a quesadilla de maiz with asada and wet style. Very large maize tortilla stuffed with cheese and asada and then topped with cheese and free sauce. I should have gotten a torta but maybe next time."}
{"text":"One thing I missed having after living in Iowa is good Mexican food. Finding Mexican cuisine in rural Iowa wasn't difficult, but the range of ingredients, freshness, and flavor often fell short of expectations. On the first visit, I came with fellow Yelpers Angela T, Fia R, and Kurdy S. More recently, I introduced my aunt to this place when she came to visit me. There's plenty of parking in the strip mall. Lighting isn't the best, and the hole in the wall décor consists of tiled floors, large open kitchen, TVs, and a down to earth vibe.   The first thing interested diners need to know is their specialization in tortas. These gigantic subs are known for their size that probably weighs more than 5 pounds. The Del Rey ($9.50) came fully stacked with ham, cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, two hot dogs, chorizo, eggs, tomato, onion, avocado, chipotle sauce, and a plate full of potato chips. There seemed to be no end to this sandwich, as I couldn't even finish half of it. In terms of quality, I liked the overall composition, the soft toasted bread, and the apparent shock effect for the amount of calories this beast carries. However, the refried beans could be more evenly spread, and the breaded beef could be seasoned so it has flavor. It was an item fun to have in group situations, and a novelty to cross off my long and never-ending to-eat list.  The Nopales con Asada ($10.99) came with thick slices of grilled beef, cactus, fresh cheese, guacamole, and my choice of flour tortillas. The beef was juicy, fully marbled, chewy, and flavorful. The cactus was a highlight too, but was slightly over-salted. Food again was plentiful. I couldn't finish it all and had to take the rest to go. I'm likely order this again.  The Chilaquiles ($7) came with fried tortilla, cotija cheese, runny eggs, onions, sour cream, and green and red salsa. The combination was delicious, particularly with the thick runny egg yolks to finesse the crispy textures and sharp salsa. The mix of flavors was still not as excellent as the Chiaquiles at Anepalco's, but it is a dish I would recommend besides the torta.   The Pollo Burro ($6.75) came with chunky chicken, refried beans, pico de gallo, cheese, and avocado. The texture was too wet and mushy. El Farolito has a better burrito, where each ingredient is discernible and better seasoned. I don't recommend it.  Another item I would not recommend is the Cocktel de Camaron Chico ($10.99). It came with shrimp, tomato juice, cilantro, onions, and avocado. The ratio was off as the few shrimps were lost in the tomato juice. The support cast could come chunkier as fillers. I felt like I had gone fishing only to come up empty with a few tiny shrimps. Overpriced and it was awful.  These meals would not be complete unless I hit the 10,000 calories mark. So, for dessert, I highly recommend getting the Chocoflan ($5). It's a custard cake, not too sweet, very moist, and rich in chocolate flavor. It was addictive and easy to finish.   For drinks, I liked the Aguas Frescas Naturales ($3.50). I preferred the watermelon flavor to the cantaloupe, and the non-alcoholic King Margarita ($4.50) was also worth considering as it comes with fresh strawberries with a touch of salt in every sip.  The food took some time to arrive at our table and service was very absent unless we flag down someone to help us. Overall, I thought this restaurant offers a good variety of dishes, and portions were consistently out of this world. However, I have also had better and cheaper Mexican food elsewhere. I would consider this a good place to bring out of town guests looking for hole in the wall experiences. 3.5 stars for both visits, I'd be interested in coming back."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place. It was recommended by a cousin of mine who is an AZ native. This place had several reviews raving about the Mexican food that was offered here. The inside is very Mexican like. A lot of good Mexican music being played as well as the decor. The menu had a variety of things to choose from. How can you come to a torta place and not order a torta??? I ordered El Principe. It came with beans, pico de gallo, salsa, Mexican cheese, choice of meat (beef) jalapeños and some lettuce. It was really good!! Everything from the flavor to the portion size was on point. This place was definitely a highlight of my day. I would recommend coming especially since the guy from Man vs Food came here in 2012. Check it out!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I tend to go to all the locations they have here in phoenix. But this is my favorite one, since I live near it. The first thing that will grab your attention, is the employees. They have what are perhaps the nicest, most Courteous employees that can be found! They blow you away with the hospitality here.  The food here is also ridiculously flavorful, and delicious. I usually always get the Tortas, but when I bring friends along, or the wife they all get different things. I have tried just about everything here. The aguas, and fantastic. I've only ever had one issue, but it was not at this location but at the cave creek one. It seems that sometime the Piña Coladas are made differently. But other than that always great food. Try the licuados! Last but not least, the employees. The waitresses, and especially the hostesses are the definition of hospitality. They treat you like you are part of their family!"}
{"text":"Ordered the King Carlos IV.  It was HUGE, two of us ate half of it.  I thought it would be smaller than that.  It had all the major meats plus hotdogs, cheeses, and a siracha type sauce.  I think this was featured in diners, drive-ins, and dives.  It was very good but just wow huge.  It came with a side of ruffled chips.  Very nice people.  The fruit smoothies were good the horchata decent but not the best I've had.  Great bang for your buck though.  I'd go again and try something a bit more sensibly sized.  There was a wait of about 15 minutes or so.  Very popular on a Saturday for lunch :)"}
{"text":"This was my go-to spot for Tortas with my boyfriend when I lived on this part of town.   The service is always so friendly every time we have been here. They give you chips and salsa immediately and keep your water topped off.   I've tried a bunch of their different tortas, but tend to get the \"mini\" tortas since I can't eat that much. You get plenty of food for the money you pay, and it's quite yummy!   I recommend this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat!  The tortas are delish & massive!  Very authentic.  Def a hidden gem."}
{"text":"We waited for almost an hour for our food for pick up, we were hoping it was worth the wait since there were so many people and it seemed like everyone loved the food, well I was WRONG! The meat was DRY, the horchata was STALE and tasted BLAND. If you want good Mexican food I'd go to filibertos instead and at least the wait will be far less than an hour. If I could give this place zero stars, I would. Food was just AWFUL."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! There's a reason why this place is called the king of tortas. They really know their stuff! Love it!"}
{"text":"Tortas?  Chips? No alcohol? This place is \"ok\"! Over priced! Overrated! & plain! Amazing what a TV show can do for a joint like this. The waitresses are nice & good looking! That's about it!"}
{"text":"I got the Torta Mexicana and a lime agua frescas. I must have made the wrong choice in torta because it was pretty boring - the meat wasn't really seasoned, the avocado was just lumped on instead of spread evenly, and there were no beans like the menu says. I got it without jalapeño so maybe that would have made the difference but overall, I was pretty disappointed. Also, it was just the torta (only slightly larger than your average fast food burger) and a side of radish and cucumbers (???) that I didn't want and some cabbage/lettuce mix I put on my burger myself for over $7.  However, the agua frescas was DELICIOUS.  I would come back and try to make a better choice but overall, a pretty disappointing experience that left me unsatisfied and $12.50 poorer. You've steered me wrong, Man vs. Food guy."}
{"text":"The food arrived promptly, it was warm and delicious, I dont know If I can ask for more.  I ordered the Torta Mexicana with a Mango drink, and both were as my friend Dora says \"Deliciosos\". For Mexican restaurants Los Reyes de la Torta remains my number one."}
{"text":"Great tasting Tortas at a great price. We will marking this place for a return trip even though it's far from home. The service was great and staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"..just had the most deliscious late brunch at this place. Started with a freshly made aqua fresca Pina Colada. Ordered the Torta del Rey and la Plata del Peluche. The place is famous for its tortas... and damn I know now why. Both mains were absolutelly delicious. To finish of, we ordered the flan for desert, that was like the cherry on the top, literally. Def great place and nice service. Coming back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Another local restaurant on Triple D!  Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  Tonight I take on the Torta Del Rey!   Yum!  A good place to go!  I have found they have good food and good service.    I would recommend that you give this place a try because I think you will enjoy it.  When you go in - tell them that Chris from Yelp recommended you go there.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We dropped by here after doing touristy things in Phoenix. I'd like to think I'm a bit of a foodie and was quite pleased to find this restaurant packed and quite renown (thanks, Adam Richman!). There was a wait at around 1:30pm on a Sat, but we asked if we could sit at this one small 2 person table by the kitchen (which was empty) and they let us. We quickly ordered with the help of our friendly waitress, and got these amazing agua frescas (pineapple - YUM!) on top of a pretty authentic meal (see pic). The prices were super affordable, the service fast, and we left very full and happy."}
{"text":"We heard good things about this place We got there at 4:00 pm. Was only 2 other tables with.people. they had already been served. First thing I noticed was the dead and live flys on the window sill. We still ordered since we were there.  I ordered lingua tacos, the Wife, the gorda chicharone. After 30 minutes she asked where.the food was. The waitress forgot to turn in the ticket! We changed the order to go. Added carne tacos. 45 minutes later we got our food  Adam Richmond may have eaten here in 2012  it, it sucked for us! The.food was o.k. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Does \"Los Reyes de la Torta\" translate to \"gut bomb?\" Because that's what I got there. The food tasted good but man, did my stomach not like me for it.  The boyfriend and I ordered the mushroom queso and a torta to share (these things are huge). I would not order the queso again. I guess we just didn't know what it was. We expected a queso dip for chips. We got a plate full of melted cheese that I guess you put into tortillas. It was difficult to manage and just not really what we wanted.  The torta was tasty, I'll give 'em that. But honestly, it could have been better. We got one with pineapple and chipotle mayo. Could have used more of both. The mayo was almost non-existent. But there was plenty of meat so even though we shared one torta we were more than stuffed walking out of there.   I would give it another shot but only if I was really, really hungry."}
{"text":"Plan for this meal.  You MUST plan for this meal because one sandwich is big enough to be food for the whole day.  The location is in a tiny strip mall just north of Dunlap.  It's nothing fancy.  Expect to see all kinds of people, lots of them, and they are all talking loudly.  This afternoon, when I was there, the place was packed with Hispanic families with lots of small kids, a bunch of older white haired people who must live nearby and their newspapers, a couple of tourists, and a nice kid who said his brother had sent him to pick up dinner.  He had never been there and looked around cautiously at the place until the waitress finally spoke English to him.  Since the place is named for the beautiful sandwiches they serve, I will start with those...  soft buns are loaded with different combinations of ham, breaded beef, pork sirloin, eggs,  chicken, cheese, guacamole, assorted peppers or chilies, tomato and sometimes a little onion... One torta is more than enough for 2 people.  They have taco plates with 3 tacos for under $5.  Their tacos come in varieties you may not have considered before... How about beef tongue tacos? or perhaps beef brains?  For the less adventurous, they have Hawaiian (beef, bacon, ham, bell peppers, pineapple, and cheese) or chorizo.  I like the shrimp quesedillas... also big enough to split. There are a lot of different shrimp dishes on the menu.  I should try a few others, but every time I walk in the door, I can hear the quesedilla calling my name.  They have fresh fruit drinks served in fishbowl sized goblets, and different kinds of fruit cocktail with whipped cream, honey or sweet cream for dessert.  They also have flan in different flavors.  I noticed a good breakfast menu that is served before 11 am, but I have never tried it. I think I would end up going home to sleep off the food if I tried to eat a big meal like that in the AM."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Have not had a good torta since I lived in San Diego, I think I found my new place!"}
{"text":"A little insight on the hater reviews I read, please never, ever, ever, compare Taco Bell to any real Mexican restaurant, if you eat that garbage, you do not deserve to eat real Mexican food, as your pallet is used to cheddar cheese on everything and can only like hamburgers, pizzas and hot dogs. Cheddar cheese is nowhere to be found in Mexico except in Mcdonalds and Burger King hamburgers. Don't order to go from an actual restaurant, you wouldn't go to Donovan's and order a steak to go, would you???? Go with time or don't go at all. If you have a service dog, provide proper documentation for it, so that they actually believe you (real service dogs usually have cute vests saying that, and don't pet me signs). Leave the chips alone, they serve huge amounts of food and it will be a waste of food to eat the chips vs the actual food. If you are a vegetarian there is a Sprouts farmers market in the same parking lot, go there and order a glutton free kale sandwich, you have no business going to restaurants unless its True Foods. On the positive: the food is great and as authentic as you can get here in Az. I can only say that for maybe 2 other places in the entire Maricopa county. Huge portions, order wisely. Service is better at the Phoenix location because they need to turn over those tables every second, because of limited spacing. Price very reasonable compared to portions served."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal. I got the Reyes torta and I could barely bite into it because it was so big. The torta has a variety of ingredients inside but they all went well together and you could really taste each layer as you bit through it! The food was affordably priced and definitely worth it"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  It's a little tough to get to due to how cave creek and 7th St merge but once you find it, it's a gem.  I always get the same thing, the nortena torta with chicken.  The Mexican sandwich is marinated grilled chicken with jalapeño and onion tossed in. They then top it with Jack cheese, avocado and a chipotle cream sauce. It's incredible.  The bread is super soft and light.  My favorite item here is the orange salsa.  It's sweet with a little touch of heat, I could honestly drink the stuff.  I ate there with a buddy and we went through like 5 of the little dishes, it's insanely good.  My understanding is there authentic drinks are very good too but I haven't tried them personally. The service is always spot on.  This is one of the better sandwiches in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I had the Alambre de Camarón and hubby had the famous Del Rey.. delicious food and great service!! We'll be back soon. xx"}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and had the same experience. Great food and friendly staff but to get something to drink takes a really long time. We were seated, ordered and got our food before we even got our drinks. We also asked for water and never got it. Also napkins seem to be very scarce here and you really need them. If you don't mind slow service and want great authentic Mexican food then I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I know in some cultures, food is envisioned as a symbol of affection.  And if that's the case, the Del Rey at Los Reyes de la Torta must really be a symbol of love, because it was stupidly gigantic.  Honestly, I wasn't even that hungry when I went.  It was just nearby, and I didn't want to have a trip out to Phoenix without trying a torta, so I went, figuring like most other foods, I can power it down like the fatty fat fat I occasionally am.  After driving past several adult entertainment establishments and businesses in Spanish on an unflattering section of Indian School Rd., I found myself at Los Reyes, and was fortunate to find a parking space immediately up front like a rockstar.  Upon entering, it's a expansive floor filled with tables and booths.  A stage indicates that this place probably clears the tables out and is a makeshift dance club of some sort on off-hours.  Regardless, I'm seated promptly, and given chips and salsa right away.  Despite not speaking much beyond a lick of Spanish, I get an attractive waitress that understands our plight and mercifully converses with us in English.  I order a Del Rey, after being told that the King Carlos V is only available at the other location.  Which turned out to be for the best, because when the Del Rey arrived, I feared what could possibly have made a Del Rey even bigger to mutate into an abomination of a King Carlos?  Have you ever played a video game where you think you're doing good, but then you get to the second-to-last boss, and he turns out to beat your ass and you never actually get to see what the final boss even looks like?  That's what the Del Rey was.  It was a monstrosity of meat, eggs, cheese and more meat, smashed between two pieces of bread.  The french fries on the side almost are all individually laughing at you, as if to say \"you won't eat us, because you won't even finish that MF'ing sandwich!\"  I didn't realize what I had gotten myself into.  Fearlessly, or recklessly, I plowed in, and devoured one half of my torta.  It was fantastic.  I debated on whether or not I should even try the second half, to which my friend called me a (lady part) and dig in, to which I obviously had to.  In the end, the bread remained, and I ended up messing it up and making it look like it was eaten somewhat before I threw in the towel.  The fries all remained, laughing at me.  It would have been better off taken to go, and handed out the window to the homeless guy that was hanging out on the exit ramp near my hotel.   Conclusively, it was a sandwich worthy of feeding four people, for just about $9.  Absurd bang for the buck.  It was made fresh and tasted great, but obviously I was ill-prepared for the experience.  Even on an empty stomach, I probably would have failed to finish it.  I can't believe there's something more epic than this, in the King Carlos.  Staff was all quick, and polite to a non-Hispanic like me, and the location might be sketchy, but it's easy to get to.  I do want to go back if/when I make it back to Phoenix some day."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant. I wish they had one closer to my house, as it's not exactly in the best part of town... but who cares the food is fantastic. If I'm even remotely close to the area this is a must stop detour. Growing up with authentic Mexican food, I've been generally disappointed with the options when I moved to Phoenix. However, this place is as good as it gets. The food couldn't taste any better.... it's simply PERFECTION. I used to not even be a fan of tortas until I tried theirs. The torta Nortena is food heaven!"}
{"text":"I went here on a recommendation from a friend who visited Phoenix two months ago.  The date of my visit was August 2.  The food was very good.  The avocado slipped quite a bit from the sandwich, but it was good overall.  The service was so-so - my waitress didn't seem to like serving me at first after she realized that I didn't speak any Spanish, but she remained pleasant."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place is SO good! I got the Torta Nortena Steak, my wife got one of the Quesadillas (Which was the largest one I have ever seen) This food is just so freaking awesome! The tortas I believe are made fresh every day and maybe even there. Light and delicious, the toppings on the Tortas are so simple yet so yummy.   This is a warning people!!! If you go, you will be addicted and you WILL go back over and over!!! If you go on a weekend, plan on waiting as it gets very crowded. Take out here as well.   YUMMY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"After hearing about all the hype about this place and seeing it on Man V. Food i just had to try it out. And let me tell you this Los Reyes de la Torta lives up to the hype!  These are the best tortas i have ever had in my whole life and have not found a place better than it in arizona. My personal favorite is the milanesa it just reminds me of my childhood eating breaded steak almost every night for dinner. They use great quality ingredients and they dont skimp out on them and thats what makes this place so great!  Their drinks are awesome too! The agua de fresas is the best thing ever! its so refreshing and tasty its the perfect thing to wash down your torta with.   Los Reyes de la Torta is definately the king of tortas so make sure you try this place out."}
{"text":"Phoenix royalty is in the 'slope! These guys, without question, are los reyes. They are not screwing around by making such a claim.   People love the huaraches, which are gigantic corm tortillas covered with white cheese, red or green salsa, and mushrooms (hongos) or various meaty choices. I've had the huarache with mushrooms and the version with carne asada. I've also had the mouth-watering shrimp burrito. All are delicious, but...  The tortas are where it's at. I mean, they strike some kind of poetic balance that resists duplication. The sandwiches have a variety of toppings and fillings, and are served on a beautiful bolillo roll. I'm partial to the milanesa (breaded chicken or beef). There's something about the mild crunch of the filling that combines with the smoothness of the avocado and the kick of the jalapeno. Fantastic.  Los reyes also deliver on the beverage front. The make their own fresh juice, so there are quite a few options for aguas frescas, licuados, etc. One thing worth trying is the vampiro: orange, carrot, celery, beet, and pineapple juices. The vampiro will probably cure the most intractable ailment.  The restaurant is also bustling and fun. Servers are friendly and multi-lingual. If you live in Sunnyslope, check the place out immediately. If not, it's worth a trip!"}
{"text":"This is real Central/Southern Mexican food--del Distrito Federal.  If you don't know what that means, you probably have no concept of real Mexican food (and FYI, burritos are NOT real Mexican food) and need to travel outside of the resorts in Rocky Point, Cancun, Acapulco, etc.  My wife (del D.F.) and I are here every weekend because this is the real deal.  The tortas are equivalent to (and, in some cases, much better than) those to be found in Mexico City (and yes I can say that from experience).  Their quesadillas, sopes, and huaraches are huge and are on-par with everything we've found in el D.F. and el Edo. de Michoacan.  Not sure how they can mimic the authentic taste of la masa de maiz here in the USA, but they certainly pull it off.  All ingredients are fresh, and the meats are juicy and delicious.  Ceviche is top-notch.  If you do want to Gringo/Norteno out, they do have burritos with green and red chile sauceand flour tortilla quesadillas.  Atmosphere is friendly and clean--this is not gourmet, but not a hole-in-the-wall either.  The original 7th Street location is the best we've found in the entire US--bar none.  The Western location leaves a little to be desired in terms of taste and service.  Plenty of wait staff fluent in both English and Spanish, so be patient and they'll take great care of you!  CANNOT GIVE A HIGHER RECOMMENDATION!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe all the nay-sayers I see posting here.  So I had to update my review to answer a few \"disputes\" listed by the rather clueless individuals posting hereto.  1.)  Their Carne Asada is made from TOP SIRLOIN.  NO RESTAURANT in the WORLD (except Los Reyes) makes their Carne Asada from top sirloin.  So for those who say that their meat is \"garbage\" or \"old\"--think again.  2.)  Frozen rice?  Everything here is hand-made.  Not reconstituted.  They don't have \"frozen rice.\"  3.)  Crappy frijoles?  These are made from scratch.  If you think they aren't \"up to par\" with other AZ offerings . . . I know FIRST HAND that most of the \"Mexican\" restaurants here in the Valley reconstitute their \"frijoles\" from a powdered mix with boiling water.  If you prefer the taste of that crap . . . then, of course, you have no clue as to how real frijoles are prepared en Mexico.  Much like people who turn their noses up at Prime Rib because it doesn't taste like a McDonald's hamburger.  4.)  This is real-deal cooking from D.F.  If you don't know what that means, you probably need to do a little traveling.  If it doesn't match the \"Tex-Mex\" or burrito/chimichanga fare you are used to (PS:  neither of those are Mexican dishes--they were invented in El Paso, TX, USA around 1912) then don't decry them based on your lack of experience.  Try actually going to Southern Mexico--ask for a Burrito and they'll laugh in your face; ask for a chimichanga and they'll look at you in confusion.  Most Mexican nationals have NEVER SEEN A BURRITO UNLESS THEY HAVE VACATIONED IN THE UNITED STATES.  Mexico's regional cooking is very diverse . . . much like you won't see a Hot Brown outside of Kentucky or Mud Pie outside of Mississippi, but they are BOTH American dishes.  So don't judge if you don't know.  5.)  Not spicy enough, therefore not authentic?  That's how it is in most mainstream D.F. restaurants.  The \"heat\" that people search out here in the SW USA and then \"credit\" to Mexico is actually not how it is in real life.  And, believe me, I actually do know this from experience, having traveled most of Central & Southern Mexico on the economy, NOT on resort tours.  If you don't like the food . . . well that's certainly your prerogative.  But don't decry LRDLT's efforts and expertise based on your complete lack of knowledge/experience of REAL Mexican cuisine.  And don't compare them to Tex-Mex or \"gringo-ized\" offerings you get here in the US."}
{"text":"This was the best Torta I've ever had and I have had many.  We had the Torta Norteno, which had lean steak (carne asada), cheese, peppers, chipotle mayo, avocado and a chipotle BBQ sauce.  The food was as fresh and tasty as it gets.  We can't wait to go back and try other tortas and other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The food is good, but every time I go here the prices seem to increase. I've found other restaurants in The Valley who offer good quality and fabulous tasting food and do not have outrageous, constantly, increasing meal prices."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy, good food, huge tortas. Tv's a little loud.  But food was awesome! You definitely have to go and eat one torta"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our sandwiches and the service was great.  We felt like we were back in Mexico City."}
{"text":"This place is really gross, I was very disappointed the best thing about my meal was my water. I got the tortas del principe super greasy my boyfriend got the tortas del Reyes it was so much weird meat it was too much. The bathrooms were nice and customer service was ok but all in all the tortas were a disappointment"}
{"text":"Overpriced tortas!! I asked for \"torta de Milanesa\" and I got just a regular torta, nothing special in it and was not impressed by the size, 8 dollars for a torta is just too expensive, I can get the same thing at Ranch Market for 6 dlls, not planning on returning to this joint any time soon...."}
{"text":"I know there is a lot of hype around Los Reyes de la Torta and I am here to tell you that they are the real deal! I was very suspicious when I first arrived but I really enjoyed my dinning experience. Not fussy. Not fancy. The serve cans of soda. Service was above average. Just great food. I really appreciate the large variety of TORTAS! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I don't always eat tortas. But when I do, I prefer Los Reyes. Actually, I've never tried a torta before last night -- and to think, I used to call myself a cultured Mexican food aficionado.  This place is bomb, that's all there is to it. I had the pechuga asada torta (bomb), side of guacamole (so bomb), pineapple agua fresca (way bomb), and half of my girlfriend's estillo del rey quesadilla (SUPER BOMB). The guacamole was some of the best I've ever tasted, although I heard some complaints about an overload of cilantro. Man up, cilantro is awesome.  The prices were a little high from what I would expect out of a dinky little Mexican restaurant, but I guess after you're featured on Man vs. Food you're allowed to overcharge. Or if your food is this damn good.  The next time I go, I'm definitely going to scoop up a strawberry agua fresca -- I tried my friend's, and it was... you guessed it, turbo bomb. It's a little bit of a drive from North Scottsdale, but any man will drive a few extra miles for some good tacos."}
{"text":"Legit food!  Never dissapoints wife and kids love it too!  Just don't like its a 25 minute drive"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Definitely not your typical southwestern mexican food, but much more Mexico City style.  I've had several of the tortas  (and they've been amazing), plus I've  had their tacos and they were equally good, but several visits ago my wife got me to try the Bistec Quesadilla de Maiz and I've  been hooked every since.  Don't come to this place expecting enchiladas & tamales, but if you want to try some really good Mexico City style mexican food than this is the place."}
{"text":"Been to the one on Dunlap(ish) and 7th street. And i definitely like that one better. The tortas are both good, it's just they prepare some food a little differently. or it tasted like it.  Obviously i didnt have them side by side (that would be a heart attack waiting to happen), but from memory that's what sprang up.  A little far out of the way for me to go back to.  Good prompt service."}
{"text":"While the food here was pretty tasty, my tacos in particular being very good. My problem here, is that the tacos only had a suggestion of meat filling, and the prices are kinda silly high for what you're getting. I did try a second visit, and ordered a carne assada burrito for lunch, the burrito was about half the size I expected to receive. To me it doesn't matter if you have delicious food, if I'm still a kind of hungry when I leave. Overall pretty underwhelmed."}
{"text":"My go-to place when I'm craving a torta. So glad I don't have to drive to north Phoenix anymore!"}
{"text":"everything about my meal was awesome. If you are on a diet and deserve a cheat, this is the haven for you! The ingredients were fresh, the wait staff was friendly, and the prices were not absurd. Everything about this place I enjoy, and I am glad they are receiving all the attention by the food network and news. Sweet greasy goodness, there really isn't much more to say :)"}
{"text":"The most amazing Mexican food I have found outside of Mexico! They don't have a liquor license, but beyond that they have no flaws. Great service, great food, great everything. Don't let its location fool you. This place is tops."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way!  Heard about this place from Man v Food so I gotta try it out.  Got there on a sunday noon and the place was packed!  Decided that I didn't want to wait 30-50 minutes for table so we got it to go.  The famoud del ray torta lived up to its billing. It's probably the best one I've ever had and definitely the biggest.  Only wish I don't live so far away or I'll be a regular here."}
{"text":"Overall, good service.  Our server was patient and offered guidance in making my decision. This evening the restaurant was fairly empty except for the large party that was there celebrating a child's (?) Birthday. After we finally decided on what we were having and ordered I realized they actually close fairly early.  Eight p.m. seems like an early hour to close. Our dinners were delivered moments after our beverages had been dropped off and they looked so good.  Mmm.  One of the items delivered was actually not what had been ordered.  She brought two (2) of the Tortas del Ray and one was a tally supposed to be an omelette.   It was discussed and then decided it would be consumed instead of sending it back and waiting for the correct entree to be made . All of it was tasty. And it was just too much.   So of course we had to split the Esquimo.  I honestly can't recommend one thing because the few times I've dined here I've always had something different and they've all been really good. So I would suggest you be adventurous, try something new."}
{"text":"This place is a lot bigger, nicer, cleaner than the original Cave Creek location with better décor.  The food is the same as the original location, very authentic, delicious and big tortas.  Actually, everything is done big!  The enchiladas, with fresh made tortillas, the quesadillas, the drinks...even the tacos have a lot of meat.  So yummy.  My favorite is the pina colada drink and all the other fruity drinks.  This food is expensive though, so we only go as a family treat.  Otherwise, your local Mexican restaurant or Ranch Market will give you the same for cheaper.  Also, Thursdays kids eat free."}
{"text":"came here late on a Thursday night. My wife and I split the Del rey torta and i really liked it. I would order it again. also ordered a watermelon fresca that was really good also.  the sandwich came with potato chips which we all thought was weird because we were at a Mexican restaurant but it was a sandwich i guess but still would rather had tortilla chips."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. I got the del rey torta and it was spectacular. My friend got a breakfast plate that looked as homemade as it could be. I would definitely go back to this place and try the other tortas and fresh drinks they offer. Never had a sandwich like this before, MUST TRY! friendly wait staff too"}
{"text":"Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby.... Norteña de Res o Pollo Torta  On my quest for the best torta in Phoenix, I surprised my guest and picked up a Norteña de Res o Pollo ($8.99). Fill to the max, this sandwich was stuffed with seasoned grilled chicken, onions and jalapeños, melted cheese, tomato, avocado, chipotle sauce with the refried beans slapped on the bun. How could this be legal? All the ingredients mingled together as each bite grew bigger and bigger. We were fighting for the next bite until there was no more. Note to self: order a second one. This is definitely a \"hearty\" meal. The bun was soft and everything remained intact.    Luckily, I called in my take out order to avoid waiting in line because the establishment was completely filled during the lunch hour. As I peaked inside, it was a compact eating area with the waitresses hustling to take orders. We thoroughly loved our meal and hope to try it again in the future.   The restaurant is located in a small mini-mall and parking is available in front. If you plan to visit here, make sure to order any of their 26 tortas because you will not be disappointed.   Los Reyes De La Tora is definitely a contender to be one of the best tortas in Phoenix from us!"}
{"text":"What's a torts?  Flipping tasty is what!  Yummo   It's a burrito on a bun and wow is it ever good. The soapas are very good too but kinda bland."}
{"text":"I had  the chicken enchiladas and my wife had cevichi tostada and a side of beans. Both dishes tasted great and the prices were excellent. Thus the 5 stars. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has great authentic Mexican food! I recently tried it for lunch. The staff was also very welcoming and friendly. I didn't like the location as much, but the food and service were great. I went for lunch as I was doing some work nearby, but I would not go for supper as I don't think the area seems safe at night."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! Amazing customer service and the food is ridiculously good. Only problem is that the drinks are very pricey and if you want a fresh fruit drink, it'll cost you $5+. Other than that everything is reasonably priced and the atmosphere is great, they always have Mexican music playing and people get into it at times."}
{"text":"Along with pretty much everyone else who has left a review for this place, I LOVE THIS PLACE. I went to high school in the area and one night my dad and brother wanted to check it out (my brother is a Yelp addict and saw it had amazing reviews). I was skeptical since, driving past, it is your typical \"hole in the wall\" kind of place, but I was not disappointed at ALL. The carne asada burrito is amazing, even the salad it comes with is great. I think my favorite thing aside from that would have to be the aguas frescas, particularly the orange one...SO good. You probably will not regret ordering a single thing from this menu. I've gone back countless times, one time bringing one of my friends who was convinced that anywhere a blonde gringa tried to take her for Mexican food would be craptastic, but she loved it too."}
{"text":"This is legit Mexican food. Be sure to try something new, especially one of the huge variety of Tortas!"}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos were excellent and a great value and the norteña de res o pollo (chicken torta) was pretty good too.  Good flavoring and spice kick on the tacos!"}
{"text":"I've driven by Reyes on southern for a long time since that location opened Always curious and so glad that we finally checked it out The torta del Rey for ten bucks is ridiculously big and so tasty And their aguas frescas are so fresh and good Authentic for sure"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place since it seemed to have good reviews, I was starving, and it was close.   It took ten minutes to park at the other end of the trashed out strip mall it's located in, and I seriously felt like I might be robbed by the locals I had to walk through to get to the place. It was packed when I walked in, and I asked if I could get a sandwich to go. The trashy looking hostess rolled her eyes at me and said they were filming right now and not making anything. There were a ton of people there for lunch, and people walked in behind me and were seated. The hostess smiled at me and said \"sor-ry\" in a sing songy rudeness I seriously couldn't even believe. I just looked at her, and left.  It's really sad how hostile the place was, and how rudely the staff behaved. So much for a great sandwich. I will stick to 13 north, where the service and food are good, and I don't have to wade through garbage to get there."}
{"text":"Came here because of yelp reviews and OMG my Tacos de Alambre de Camaron were out of this world amazing!  I shared one with my husband who ordered the asada tacos and he was also blown away.  You must try them, they give you SO Much shrimp for $7.99 it is not even funny."}
{"text":"I will have to admit that because of the location and unfamiliarity of it, I was somewhat apprehensive about trying Los Reyes de la Torta. Now, I am so glad I did. This Mexico City style Mexican food was not only tasty but 1 Torta would have been more than two people with a good appetite could eat. I had the Torta Del Rey, filled with beef, pork, ham, chorizo, cheese, a fried egg, and then topped with avocado, beans, tomatoes, onions, and jalapeno. At first I thought it was an unusual combination but I was wrong, it was very flavorful. I will definitely have that again!   The location is in a small strip mall and parking is limited. This is a great neighborhood restaurant and the price is more than reasonable!"}
{"text":"I have decided....Los Reyes De La Torta is my favorite place for Mexican Food.  I  would consider myself a Mexican food fan.  I have lived in Phoenix for over 20 years and I even had a Mexican roommate who made awesome Mexican food all the time.  So I think I know my Mexican.  This was probably my fourth visit to Los Reyes.  My wife and I decided to have Mexican food for Cinco de Mayo.  I tried several new things.  I started off with the Tosada de Ceviche (Shrimp Ceviche) - Awesome flavors - just the right amount of lime/lemon and salt.  YUM!!!  Then I went with the Peluche plate packed with goodies (The steak was nicely seasoned and blended well with the sausage, ham, grilled onions, grilled peppers, pineapple, jalapenos).  My wife got the always amazing Del Rey.  We also threw on a plate of Chiles Toreados (grilled jalapeno and onions).  Everything was fantastic.  Oh yeah - they also have great Aqua Frescas.  We have taken out-of-town guests to this restaurant who also loved it.  My wife and I are surprised that we don't come here more often.    Other items that I've tried at Los Reyes that I liked as well.  Tacos de Cabazea Tacos de Asada Torta Nortena with Steak (Tacos de Lengua - not 100% sure that I have tried it here...)  I reserve my 5 star ratings for only my favorite restaurants - Los Reyes is definitely one of them!"}
{"text":"There was a time when I would have thought the Del Rey Torta was a fantastic conglomeration of meat. I must be getting old or something because the sandwich seemed like an obnoxious amalgamation of low quality meats. I had my fair share of overeating just to say I did; I legitimately felt like I'd be sick if I ate this whole thing. Were I visit again, I'd probably get a \"normal\" torta and be good with that.  P.S. - The watermelon aqua fresca was fantastic."}
{"text":"This place advertises as if is sells alcohol, it does not. I would recommend NOT buying the 5$ margarita that has no alcohol. I made the mistake of asking after the margarita tasted funny to me."}
{"text":"I was expecting to walk into a little fast food dive.  To my surprise, this place is an actual full service restaurant.  It's still kind of a dive, but I was pretty shocked to have a hostess seat me, a waitress serve me, and a bar with a random waterfall-like display for food at the prices that I saw online.  A pleasant treat almost as good as the food.  My only disappointment about my meal is I ordered the the tiny torta.  I had the ranchera del pollo; chicken, guacamole, chipotle mayo and cheese.  Very good, and perfect for its price at $7.25, but when I saw waitresses carrying the ridiculously stacked tortas, I have to admit I was hoping mine would be at least close to those.  But I should have known from the short description and cheap price that I was going to get the tinny-tiny sandwich.  My brother ordered a Del Rey.  This awesome monstrosity of a sandwich is stacked with just about every breakfast item you can imagine.  He usually eats healthy, but he enjoyed every bite he was able to take of it (although this was was one of the big ones and he could only manage half).  One thing kind of bugs me for some odd reason.  Potato chips as a side seems kind of random.  I know that tortas are sandwiches, but why isn't a mexican place serving tortilla chips?  Just wondering."}
{"text":"My best bud has been saying \"let's try this place\" for.... About as long as I've known him. He saw it on some television show Man vs Food. Okay. I love me some tortas. But it's a sandwich on a bolillo roll. Mmm but I can go and sit and not have to make it myself? And it's probably good right? I mean, it was on TV as its in Sunnyslope. So it's probably \"authentic\". And they serve aguas frescas? Si, quiero ir.   Donjay and I finally make it over after church one Sunday with Jon and Amy H along for the experience. Now in true Yelp fashion... I read the reviews and not just write them. And from the reviews I was wary of the infamous Del Rey torta. But.... We order it anyways.   This sandwich is like every meat a Mexican ever cooked piled high on a soft bolillo. The meats were all delicious, but together they made something of a strange flavor. They didn't mix well. The chorizo was really good. Almost overpowering the rest of the flavors. I found myself eating them piecemeal and not like a torta at all. Digging in with a fork and knife. Oh and side note, don't attempt to eat this on your own unless you are Sasquatch. Donjay and I split this monster and it STILL took me about 45 minutes  to an hour to eat it. I didn't finish my side of chips.   My horchata was bomb.com. And the service was awesome! Everyone was really sweet and quick and so I really want to up the stars for this review next time.   I want to go back. I want to try some other tortas. The flavors were all good individually. I think I would like to try some other dishes here as well. I saw they had nopales on the menu! Yum... Ah memories of my nana cutting cleaning and cooking yummy nopales! Please be five star worthy!"}
{"text":"Bro, have you been here? 'Cause you should be here. I have no words for the deliciousness of this torta. I shall attempt but word will not suffice. The torta Norteña de res was an amazing experience. I tasted quality and art in every bite. The bread was soft, the cheese was top-notch, the avocado was fresh, the steak seasoned like steak should. Don't listen to me or read the words I write. Eat a scrumptious torta and let your senses give you their review."}
{"text":"The closest I've tasted to real Mexican food! The food is really good!! I have been there twice and it's been 2 great experiences. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"We were staying as a group of friends and kids at the nearby Hilton resort and found this on yelp. We arrived with 12 people and they quickly moved tables and seated us. The food was awesome from the Tortas to the burgers and burritos, The Aguas we so fresh and fruity. None of us had been before and all adults and kids were happy, happy, happy!! The prices were really good too. Good food good service, authentic"}
{"text":"Yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. This place is off the chain good.  Came here with my boyfriend this past Sunday afternoon after seeing all of the awesome Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint.  The place was PACKED and we waited about 20 minutes for a table.  No biggie.  I'll wait for good food.  We were seated and ordered two agua frescas (one strawberry (for him) and a watermelon (for me)) along with two of their famous tortas.  About 20 minutes later our drinks and food came out together.  I wish the drinks came out sooner (I was thirsty), but again, the place was packed and the boyfriend and I were engaged in conversation anyway.   Tortas?  Bomb!  Agua Frescas?  Bomb!  Definitely a fork and knife kind of sandwich (it's huge!).  I preferred my watermelon agua fresca to his strawberry, but they were both yumm-o. The boyfriend couldn't say enough good things about his torta (he'd never had one)  and I was so pleased to know that I had found the amazing Mexican restaurant I had been searching for since relocating to Phoenix in July.  I'm still perplexed as to why there is such a lack of decent Mexican food here! The menu is diverse and carries many other items besides tortas so check it out.  Also, Adam Richman from Man vs Food came here to film a food challenge episode.  You'll immediately know by the wall sized photos of him strewn throughout the restaurant.  Bring your peeps and an appetite and you won't leave hungry or disappointed.  I can't wait to come back and try more stuff!"}
{"text":"Los Reyes De La Torta 1528 E. Southern Avenue Tempe, 85282  I arrived at the restaurant at 11:30, and was seated immediately. The girl seating me noted that the sun was coming in through the windows at the front of the place, and she opted to seat me at a table that would not be in the direct sun light. This was to be the beginning of a nice lunch!  Within a few minutes of my sitting down, I was greeted by my waiter, provided with what I think were homemade chips and two different salsas, as well as 3 different menus. The first menu was the lunch special menu, the second menu was an assortment of drinks on one side and desserts on the other side, and the third menu was their regular menu.  The waiter was prepared for me to take my time ordering, but I opted to order immediately, asking for an item that was not on the menu. I ordered a Lengua Burrito enchilada style with green chili on it. My waiter didn't bat an eye, but did compliment me on my Spanish! LOL.   I started in on the chips, and found them to be delicious, as were both of the salsas. While both exhibited some heat, one was definitely a bit hotter than the other, though both had excellent flavor and body. None of that thin, watery stuff here.  In short order, my burrito arrived. Large, soft, and swimming in a pool of green chili with a little crema squirted over it. It was so good I emptied my entire plate. I also ordered a Tostada de Ceviche in the appetizer size just to try it. As with the burrito, it too was excellent and a nice size just to try it.  Of interest is that the menu contains proteins that are not usually found in most Mexican/American restaurants, including Lengua (tongue), Buche (pork belly), Cabeza (beef head), and Pierna (pork sirloin). I found that the way the menu was designed, every dish was listed both with a full English description as well as a Spanish description.   The only think I did not care for was the televisions all tuned to a different Spanish language station. They took away from the atmosphere, which would have been a lot nicer had there been some good mariachi music in the background instead.  The place was spotlessly clean, and service was excellent. I hope they continue to keep up this level of food and service, because this is one of the very best Mexican style restaurants I have eaten in in this state.  4 stars for excellent food, good cleanliness, and good service"}
{"text":"I had saw this place on TV a few years ago and was pretty excited to come try it. The restaurant area is pretty, meh - to say the least. I got the torta del rey and while it was a good amount of food I didn't feel like it was particularly great. I'd try a different one in the future in hopes of enjoying it more."}
{"text":"I guess this spot was on TV for their toras (mexican sandwhich) but another thing that they should've been on tv for is the Mexican Liquados (shakes)... They are the bomb had a mango, magnificent made with excellent fresh mangos.  Tortas are legit dont order more then a torta you will fill up with half.."}

I was quickly seated by two young and bubbly waitresses.  Did I mention that this place is always packed?!  I found out why!  I started my meal by ordering the Aguas cremosas - $4.50.  I ordered the Canteloupe (choices of  strawberry, mango, banana, papaya, or canteloupe). The fresh fruit was mixed with carnation and sweet cream.

{"text":"This is my first visit to the new hotel and casino.  On my way from work to the hotel, I called up reservations to ask what my dining options were at this time of the night (arriving at 8:30p) and was told that I had Ditka's (steakhouse), the 24/7 Cafe, and the food court, where I could find Panda Express, Fat Burger, and Los Reyes de la Torta.  As soon as I heard \"Los Reyes,\" I knew where I would go for dinner.  :)  After studying the three menu boards overhead (a shorter list of their regular selection of tortas, aka sandwiches, and tacos) and concentrating on the tortas board, I considered two options: Cubana and the Carne Asada.  I ordered the Cubana (ham, sliced roasted pork loin, melted cheese, jalapenos, onions, and minus the avocado, and served with refried beans) since that was what grabbed my attention the most.  I was told my wait would be around 10 minutes, so I went to the Players Club to get a reprint of my card, should I ever get the itch to gamble during my stay.  (I found out the unused free slot play I'd received when I first applied for my card years ago was only good for the first 24 hours, so I was not able to get a re-issue of that free play- darn!  However, if you play nice, you can always get something comped.  :)  Thank you, Patrick!)  After getting a new copy of my card, I made a quick stop at the Square Bar for a glass of wine, and then headed to LR to retrieve my to-go order**.  A styrofoam box with my name on it was waiting for me, and while I dropped off my claim ticket, I asked where I'd find the utensils and was told it was at the cubicle next to me (couldn't see it because I was approaching the pick-up section from the left and the divider kept me from seeing the utensils, condiments, wet naps, and napkins, which were to my right).  The tables are cafeteria-style, so just grab one that looks clean.  This sandwich, which came with ridged potato chips, was HUGE!  I expected refried beans goop, but these were actually whole beans scooped onto the bottom of the sandwich, upon which sliced ham, white cheese, sliced pork, tomatoes, sauteed seasoned onions, and jalapeños were added.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-reyes-de-la-torta-laveen?select=XmayEHOPKoQE1L20R-H1jQ#XmayEHOPKoQE1L20R-H1jQ  The telera roll was toasted and buttered- so delicious!  It was all I could do not to eat the whole thing, and I am accustomed to eating light at every meal.  I ate so much that I don't think I'll need to eat breakfast before heading for my morning swim... With Dunkin' Donuts coffee and Munchkins to tempt me, however, I may just have to force myself to have a few bites!  ;)  **  I should've just gone with \"dining in\" option, since I knew that I didn't have a refrigerator in my room.  However, I had planned to look for a bar to order a drink, since LR didn't serve alcoholic beverages, and I didn't want to leave my food open to the elements.  Thank goodness I went with the boxed option, since there are flies in the cafeteria-- disgusting!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? I think I had so high hopes for Los Reyes that set the bar too high. I was craving the El Rey and ordered it as soon as I say down. To be honest te torta was just alright. I mean I actually finished it, but I felt like I had to keep eating it to like it more. It was just alright...I wouldn't order it again. I think it just too much going on in the sandwich I couldn't really like it.   Now my wife had the carna asalda tacos and they were very good! I found myself wishing I would have ordered the tacos. 3 giant sized tacos good deal for the price.   I will actually return to Los Reyes. I want to try the chicken torta next time and some tacos too. I wouldn't rate my experience bad here...just average. Hopefully I'll like it better next time not ordering the El Rey!!"}
{"text":"Really good and authentic Mexican food. from the ambiance, to the decoration and the food. really good place to eat Mexican food."}
{"text":"Thank heavens I came hungry. Eating just half of my Torta Norteña blasted every last hint of hunger out of my body for the rest of the day (and part of the next day).   The sandwiches didn't take long after we ordered, but the few minutes we had waiting at our table were filled with sweet horchata and Marc Anthony music videos.   When the food came, I could only manage to make it halfway through the Torta Norteña, which is a sandwich stuffed with thinly sliced beef, grilled onions, tomato, jalapeños, chipotle mayo, bubbly cheese and fresh avocado. It's a hot mess... and so good you'll WANT to get your hands (and your shirt/pants/neighbor) dirty.  My boyfriend ordered a shrimp ceviche tostada (very tasty) and the Torta de la Reyna, which was enormous and came with everything mine did... plus a zillion other things like chorizo, ham, what looked like a whole omelet, etc.   We used the Yelp app a lot while we were traveling, which is great when you're looking for something like \"cheap Mexican food\" because it brings you to neighborhoods you wouldn't normally check out while visiting. This is how we found Los Reyes de la Torta. I'm sure there are plenty of tourists flocking here after the Man vs. Food shout-out (we didn't know 'til we arrived), but it didn't feel the least bit touristy and I I liked that."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Mexican food ! A few tables inside -small place . I'd imagine this place getting packed at lunch hour .   We started with the tostada de ceviche and the tostada de tinga with guacamole- perfect . Next was Torta del principe and huaraches con tingo de pollo with grilled cactus . Portions are very big . The dinner was outstanding...the meat had great flavor . The torta came with a raw vegetable side and grilled onion/jalapeño. The cactus reminded me of string beans with more flavor . The table hot sauce was great and they also brought out a Verde sauce and a roja sauce - both awesome! Also ordered a horchata- yummy !   No alcohol served . Didn't try dessert but they sounded good . This restaurant beats out all of the uppity Mexican fusion/artisan/hipster/wannabe authentic places at triple the price . It's the real deal !"}
{"text":"This torts is everything I imagined it would be.  Ever since I seen the episode of Man Vs Food I was desperate to try it. Mos def will go back, one torta is enough for two ppl lol."}
{"text":"The only reason I shy away is because I can never finish a meal there!  I love this hidden gem of a place.  Torta's are ginormous and delish.  I did not find the place dirty, one of the first things I judge a place by.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  They cook their food to order so it is definitely not Chipotle fast, thats what makes it so good!  Not your average run of the mill Mexican food place so don't expect the usual boring fare, expect A LOT of awesome tasting food at great prices, and they have kid friendly choices to boot!"}
{"text":"I had friends in town and they had seen this place on Man Vs. Food and were dying to go. I have to admit I hadn't seen that episode, so this place wasn't on my radar at all. It's located in a little shopping center and you couldn't tell from the outside, but it was packed and this was just before 11am!  The food looked and smelled amazing as we were seated. My girlfriend and I went for the quesadilla's because frankly everything else looked so HUGE! Her husband got the sandwich that was mentioned on Man Vs. Food - La Reyna, and it looked and smelled awesome! It was massive but he finished every bite (and didn't eat for the rest of the day).  The staff was friendly and the food was good and fast! I will definitely have to bring the Hubby here!"}
{"text":"Oh my God. Real authentic Mexican food. It is awesome. It's like a little hole in the wall place, but the food is to die for. We will come back when we visit the grandkids again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. My friend and I had the taco plate and it was delicious. I also had a drink called \"boricua\" I think. It was a strawberry and watermelon mix and it was delish. I definitely recommend this restaurant for authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Wow. Biggest Torta ever. I got the Del Rey, and it was ENORMOUS. And delicious. This thing has everything and is as big as my fist (see picture). While the torta is very good (and extremely large) the real star at this joint is the agua fresca. Their agua frescas are absolutely amazing. A giant sandwich and a giant pina, and I was full for 2 days.   I will definitely go back here when I'm in this neighborhood..."}
{"text":"I've been passing by this place since it opened and just noticed that the food is Mexico City Style. So I had to try it.  It's not Americanized at all. Delicious food straight from the heart of Mexico.  The meal was fantastic and all I could have asked for. Home made Horchita, outstanding salsa that had real flavor with lots of depth. Guacamole that I could have eaten a gallon of. Much like mine. It's more than just a mashed up Avocado. And our meals were big but we finished them. This place is wonderful and worth the visit.  I'll be getting meals to go in the future since I drive right by it daily."}
{"text":"This place is always on point you can never go wrong with the food and bomb ass drinks (mechiladas) here fresh authentic Mexican Food"}
{"text":"I am actually quite shocked at all of the five star reviews.  Although our service was outstanding, the food was just not good and there is also no alcohol, although the server did tell us this as we accidently ordered virgin margaritas.  Food was dry, seasoning was sub par and the meat quality we experienced was questionable.  Perhaps we visited on an off day, but we won't return."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican restaurant. Get the tortas, as the name implies. They are solid, but not the best I've had. They have nice spicy bottled salsas at the table to spice it up. Very filling."}

I think I will try the Quesadilla next time or the chaquiles... Not sure but I will be back.  Oh FYI the Strawberry Piña Colada )non alcoholic) is amazing!!!! Yuuum"}
{"text":"The first day i came here it, right away it became my favorite place! The food is so good and made as you order it. The place is okay size and does get full fast sometimes but worth it. The times ive come here they seat me and my family right away and dont wait too long for our food. So many choices for food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now in about a week. If I can make three, I would try it!  Love Mexican food and with Carolina's North down the street from us, it would seem hard to find a place that would give us a good Mexican food fix.    It wouldn't be fair to compare the two though...apples and oranges.  Have never really got into tortas before our visit here and this place is NOT your typical Mexican fast food place.  The atmosphere makes you feel like you are in a real Mexican restaurant.  The wait staff is super attentive and always cleaning up for you.  The food....The food is awesome.  Some simple advice.  Be adventurous.  While you might find some familiar fare, you have to try one of the tortas. They are awesome!  Have tasted three different ones and they were all excellent ( ordered the pork loin and the Alambre de Res...tasted my son's Lengua Torta...hmmmm).    On my last visit I met my cousin there.  He beat us and had already ordered a quesidilla.  That sucker is big enough for three people.  I was stuffed before we even put our order in, He doesn't like to stray from his comfort zone , so he insisted on ordering the tacos.  He also wanted rice and beans. For the most part, everything comes with a \"salad\" of shredded iceberg, grilled onions and jalepeno,sliced radishes, and lime.  When his order came, I think he was taken back by the white rice and white beans that it came with. I wanted to try them, but he does not share!  The  looked good, but I don't think I would order them..only cause the amount of food is already overwhelming. Twice it has put me into a food coma.  Try the agua frescas!  There horchata tastes homemade also...not like the stuff the serve at most places."}
{"text":"Muy delicioso! Taking up residence where JB's Restaurant used to be years and years ago, I was very excited to see that Los Reyes de la Torta would be expanding to Tempe! This restaurant serves up Mexico City cuisine, with various meaty options, some seafood (Shrimp) dishes, and a few vegetarian meals. We ventured in today, and were greeted with the buzz and bustle of a hectic opening week.   The interior is quite spacious, with warm, sunny colors and decor. There were a few people waiting in the front area for to-go orders, but we were seated promptly for sit-down service. Being my first time at a Los Reyes de la Torta location, I had to go with the Man vs. Food, Adam Richmond special: The famous Torta Del Rey ($9.50). I also tried some of the carne asada tacos.   We were served chips and salsa to start with. The salsa was thin, with good flavor and spicy heat. The torta was served sliced in half, with a large serving of crinkle-cut potato chips. It was a tall tower of meat, cheese, egg, and vegetables. When eating it, I was reminded of Adam Richmond's assessment of this sandwich on his \"Best Sandwich in America\" show. When you bite into the sandwich, you taste different layers of flavor and different temperature combinations depending on which section you bite into first (The sandwich is so big it's very hard to actually bite into all the layers at one time). The lower layer consists of a smattering of slow cooked beans and the roasted and breaded meats- the tastiest layer in my opinion! The middle section holds the cheese, scrambled egg, chorizo, and cured meats (Ham and hot dog). While I liked the ham and chorizo in the sandwich, the hot dog tended to overpower the other meats in the torta. The upper layer was the \"cool\" layer, consisting of sliced avocado and tomato. I enjoyed the combination of cool vegetables with grilled meat. However, I would have liked more of the cool ingredients to balance out all the hot ingredients. The torta itself was nicely grilled, with delicious telera bread.  The carne asada tacos were like street tacos. They had a good amount of chopped meat, cilantro, and onion on it, with some lime wedges to add more citrus flavor.  For beverages, they have a wide array of drinks to choose from (All non-alcoholic). I tried the horchata ($4), which was a little watery, but tasted freshly made and was pretty refreshing overall.  While I'm glad I tried the Torta Del Rey, it's a hefty meal. I'd definitely be interested in trying out more items from this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Again, upon Adam Richman's heels...    As a continued fan of \"Man vs Food\" and after having bookmarked a few of Adam's noted, Phoenician eateries--Chompie's, Alice Cooper'stown, and Los Reyes de la Torta--I saddled up, traversed over 350 sun-scorched miles, and with extreme prejudice negotiated terms of surrender with a literal powerhouse of a Mexican sandwich--one piled high, layered thick, and respectfully ordained \"Del Rey.\"  ¡Muy delicioso!  Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, hot dogs, omelet, chorizo, tomato, onion, avocado, chipotle sauce: all hail the King!  Ok, it's true, I may be a bit biased--after all, who am I to contradict Adam?--but unwavering confidence and grandeur shoulder this reigning torta.  My job, put simply: tossing confetti.  How am I doing?  =]  The rundown:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KjOMCauQYI.  (By the way, I visited the West Indian School Rd. location, while Adam opted northward to Sunnyslope's haunt on North 7th St.)  What was even better was being treated like kings, ourselves, while we were there.  We really were.  The service was supreme!  My only regret was not taking a picture of the Elvis statue in the window!  Yes, the King himself.  But I'll get it next time.  Trust me.  Adam...lead on!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Waiter was prompt and had good recommendations. Service was fast and we had chips and salsa while we waited. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"unfortunately for this place, their food is pretty good but their prices are OUTRAGEOUS!!!   I ordered the quesadilla de maiz w Carne asada and a water. she asked if I wanted some crumbled cheese and a drizzle of sour cream on top so i said sure. then I asked for a bit of guacamole on the side (seriously, \"a bit\" - it only lasted for half my quesadilla).   my bill was OVER $15  i almost ordered a horchata but she said a glass of that was $5!!!  like I said, pretty good food but ludicrous prices. I will not be going back for this reason. I hope you enjoyed the extra few dollars you charged this one visit instead of having a return customer who would have brought an extra person back, possibly a couple times."}
{"text":"Very nice wait staff.  Food was good and prices very reasonable.  Salsa had good flavor.  Tacos are a little small so order extra.  Overall a good place to eat."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!!!! They have the best cheese quesadilla on earth! We don't really understand  how they can take a tortillla and cheese and make it so much better than anyone else! My husband always gets La Reyna and I always get the Peluche. Sometimes service is slow, but tonight Tony was really a great server. The owner is usually there and working just as hard as everyone else. Great local spot that you can't miss!"}
{"text":"Love this place even though the parking is difficult and it has a tendency to have toothless crackheads from the neighborhood hangin in front sometimes....you're in the 'slope;  you're not going anywhere fancy.  They make on the spot agua frescas which are fruit and ice whipped up and delivered to your table in a big goblet with an umbrella on it.  I love the umbrella touch.  The melon (cantaloupe) one I get every time has never let me down with it's refreshing taste...I feel so healthy drinking it!.......and then the massive torta comes, and every healthy thing takes a backseat to these things.  I''ve never been able to finish one, and I don't even order the real big ones.   I always get the norteno with beef, and it is always awesome!  Steak, onions, peppers ,cheeses, like an entire avocado and this great sauce..Plus he grills the rolls to bring even more flavor. I hope to eat here again soon!"}
{"text":"Gosh, I am on a roll of not the greatest reviews today...well, this place was good, super busy and honestly, cannot rate fully fair because we did not order tortas at a torta restaurant. I ordered shrimps tacos. They were good...ish. I had requested extra cabbage, she said it comes with a salad so I can just add that, cool. It really didn't come with any extra cabbage.    Boyfriend got the pork tacos I think, while decent, I will say with so many awesome places to eat at, this one is not on our list as a return spot :(   No bar either."}
{"text":"Great food large portions.  Authentic Mexican if you get rid of sheriff Pyle!  You are bot going to find typical Mexican American dishes here!"}
{"text":"four stars and not five because they sat us so close to the servers station that the servers were bumping into our chairs. That being said, as soon as the food came out all thoughts of overcrowding were replaced by thoughts of heaven! Tortas from the Gods!!!"}
{"text":"I have always loved Tortas and had been wanting to try out this place. First of all,  the service was exceptional and I felt like I was actually in Mexico. The food came super fast and it was delicious! The potato chips, however were not homemade as I've had in other Torta restaurants. That is the only reason I didn't give them five stars. Overall, I enjoyed my lunch. I ate the Mexican Torta (mini) perfect portion size and adequately priced. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Even an authentic Mexican restaurant is offering a mini, I love it! Don't come at peak lunch, the parking is limited and you'll wait. I arrived around 2pm. The atmosphere is also very authentic and is why I don't think I'll ever see a location in north Scottsdale, my neck of the woods. For the few, there is a torta with 5 lbs of meat. It's the Carlos V and costs $27, but if you eat it all in 15 minutes, it's free. There is a mini bar at this location that makes you feel like your in Mexico City."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place every day for the past 5 years. Finally stopped in. I had a quesadilla,  and my husband had the del ray torta. They both were very tasty, and we even had some leftover for the next day."}
{"text":"So of course i saw the Man V Food episode last night about the Del Ray Torta. Thought is looked amazing. So for lunch i went and tried their food. It was definetely difficult to choose what i wanted. So many things looked good.   I chose the Arizona Torta. One word: Awesome!   It was hot, delicious, and tasty... Oh and i got the traditional Coke in a bottle!   Will be back.. maybe for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"I came here after craving Mexican food, and checking out these reviews! So glad I did. I brought my family, and my dad is from Mexico City. This restaurant advertises it's Mexico City style food, so we were particularly excited. We came in and were promptly greeted, and noticed it was pretty full. Like the name suggests, they have a wide selection of tortas! My brother ordered the Del Rey, which they mentioned is the most popular. He loved it, my dad loved it, and everyone was happy. The menu is pretty large and you'll have a lot to choose from, and includes some tried and true favorites- like the quesadilla. Our food came out maybe ten minutes after we ordered it. So fast!! My dad commented on how authentic the food was, and everyone enjoyed what they ordered. I'll definitely be back. If you want good Mexican, skip the chains and come here!"}
{"text":"This place is a take on traditional Mexican food.  They have some bomb shrimp ceviche. The portions are huge! No alcohol is served here but they do have a huge selection of non-alcoholic fruity drinks and smoothie type stuff that's yummy. Service is pleasant. I return regularly."}
{"text":"Chose this place out of all the places available to us in that area. Great idea! Although we sat at an awkward little table by the kitchen, our meals were wonderful.  I had the 2nd from the top of the torta list. It was the regular size, not the small one. I loved it! ahead had the carne milanesa and that was excellent too. The torta had hot dog, ham etc. Only bummer was that they had to use guacamole instead fresh avocado.  That would have made it perfect.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I moved her 14 years ago. The food here is off the hook. I recommend everything on the menu. My favorite torts is the Cuban dive in try everything you won't be disappointed. I started with the del Rey v8 juice excellence in a glass. I ordered the shrimp cocktail, so good and then the del Rey torta. It has just about everything in it. Be hungry the food is big. For desert peaches  and cream so sweet and delicious"}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night after it being on my bookmarks for awhile and I was very pleased with my meal. We were greeted immediately and seated in a booth. Our server was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal. We snacked on the chips and salsa they brought out and I am in love with their red salsa. It is very spicy but I could not stop eating it. Their other salsa was good as well. I decided on the Mexicana Torta (grilled steak, guac, onions, jalapeños) with horchata and I really liked it. I ended up adding some of the red salsa, but on its own it was good and flavorful. I am already thinking about when I will go back again to try something else."}
{"text":"Been here twice, one for dinner and once for lunch. Seems to stay pretty busy around the clock, pros ~ Multiple seating areas, very friendly staff, huge portions, cheap prices and the agua frescas are a must try, soo delicious.  Cons  ~ low quality meat used in the tortas, no chips and salsa (potato chips only) and no alcohol. In my two visits I tried the steak nortena which was really good, and the Del Ray which was just foolish on my part, left feeling completely defeated. All in all ill def. visit again, I'll just be very selective of my food choices."}
{"text":"This place is so good! From the moment you enter you feel this friendly homey vibe!  The service is amazing! The juice is fresh and made to order! The tortas are out of this world. We ordered the nortena and the milanesa and they were huge and packed with flavor! The sauces they come with are delish! My mother ordered a.quesadilla with mushrooms made out of corn and it was absolute magic! Also next door is this wonderful bakery that sells pan dulce a d trea leches and all sorts of teat that is really wonderful! I am obsessed with this place! The hype is real!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I been coming here since I was a little girl, and I had never had a problem with this place. Their tortas are to die for, and their fruit waters are a must if you come here."}
{"text":"-Food: HUGE portions, very tasty, delicious, & fresh! Good prices.  -Tortas come with either a side salada or rippled-style potato chips.  -A small accompaniment of red and green salsa...muy caliente!  -Service was friendly, but slow (we had to hunt down the waitress to take our order)...they all wore yellow shirts and had a ponytail, so it made it a challenge when we had to ask for the check.  -We came in at 11am...but it was already very busy. We were still able to get a table, but they are very close to other tables...unless you want to sit in the lap of another person...  -Restroom is very clean.  -Pay your check with the cashier up front.  -Parking is not so convenient. The spots are very tiny, maybe meant for those Eurpean Smart cars. It's like a normal size parking spot that was split in two...is this to give the illusion of MORE parking spots? Someone parked so close to me, I thought I was going to have to climb into my car through the back window."}
{"text":"The five star ratings are accurate. This place is AMAZING. Truly some of the most delicious food I've had. And the staff was friendly and gracious. We will go out of our way to come back again the next time we're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ok so we gave Los Reyes de la torta another chance and I am super happy we did. We went for breakfast and it was very good. We order the chilaquiles ( they are best half green half red and with meat) and the eggs with steak which was HUGE and very tasty. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Food was good, although parking was difficult to find. It is also very easy to miss, so you might want to come a few minutes early if you are meeting someone. A tad pricy for the amount of food"}
{"text":"You know we moved to AZ a little over a year. Adjusting to a different climate, culture, and food ethnicity I had to really adapt and reset my mindset of how to eat out and learn to try Mexican dishes, since it's all over the place here. Being born and raise in Hawaii we don't have much Mexican places and if we do, it's not the best or it seemed like it wasn't anything fascinating, maybe the margaritas was more tastier because we had our lihing mui margaritas which is da bomb over tequila margaritas!  Coming to this homely restaurant is changing my concept of thinking it's not so bad, in fact it has much more flavors on each bite.  Stepping into the restaurant, although we do not speak the language, I love how they greet us and they know we sorta understand what they are saying! The hostess to our waitress, which we had her twice, have the pleasant hospitality. It does take us awhile to figure out what we wanna eat because the only dishes we are familiar with is \"Enchiladas, burritos, guacamole dip, and a few of their tacos\" lol... our waitress, she is patient with us as decide!  I love how their are so many Mexicans flock as families to come in and sit around the table Celebrating birthdays and etc. I love how they all greet each other with a hug/kiss before they sit down and here laughter in the air! I miss this sooo much because it reminds me of how our culture back home does the same. The restaurant has good vibes, good energy, laughter and the food is outstanding!  I've been too a few Mexican places and I have a hard to acquiring the taste because I'm unsure or haven't really found anything that I can be drawn too to enjoy!  But, for this place - I am enjoying very much of their atmosphere, I love how our waitress, she remembers us from our first visit & my husband loves the food and so do I. For me to say this is a shocker because I'm not accustom to it!  But, tonight having dinner and just being in the midst of families made it even more special to enjoy the surroundings, their culture, and their amazing dishes... on the other hand, I still have a hard time drinking water from the cup, I have to ask for lots of lemon to kill the pipe water taste!  Friendly, family restaurant, good vibes & now I have kanak attack ..."}
{"text":"The Del Ray torta has really good combination of flavors, but it's so huge and a little embarrassing to try to eat around so many people. It's not really a knife and fork type of sandwich either. You get a choice of chips or \"salad\" and I went with the salad. It's cucumbers, radishes, and grilled onion on top of shredded lettuce. Tasty, but it should just say \"fresh veggies\" and not salad! I also didn't like how most of the menu was in spanish. I know some spanish, but not that much! They should have both english and spanish versions of the detailed items."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food at a fair price.  Very authentic.  I went here with my parents and they loved it.  We had burritos, quesadilla, tacos, and tortas.  All were delicious.  Menu is friendly and lets you know what is in there, don't be afraid to ask for them to hold something out for you.  They cook each meal to order.  Food comes out hot and tasty.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Los huaraches supper grandes y muy ricos lis sopes super grandes recien hechos y las piña coladas super Ricans sin Alcohol"}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for the past 5 years and they have maintained their low prices and great quality food. I lived in Mexico for 10 years and this is as authentic as it gets in Arizona."}
{"text":"Awesome tortas!  Love this place!  Friendly service, clean, and great food.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This was our first time having tortas. They were delish! I had one of the torta chicas which is basically just a smaller version of some of the tortas. I had the Hawaiian one which was awesome. Had ham, pork, cheese, pineapple and a special mayo. It was just the right size for me. My husband had a regular sized del ray. It was just the right size for him. We were sat quickly and our food came in lightening speed.  I would totally go back if we lived in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Love this place. I would recommend you give them a chance. I have been to the one in Phoenix and a buddy of mine told me to try tis one out and I was glad I did."}
{"text":"Heard about this place on Man vs Food... went here with my folks who were in visiting from out of town. Amazing waitresses and the food was outstanding!"}
{"text":"The best torta in a valley where every Mexican restaurant claims to have the best. Magical. Great staff, fast service. Authentic."}
{"text":"Yelp help is usually 99% on point, but this place was not a favorite. Food fair, salsa awful, and the overall experience was not the best. Wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here and was not disappointed.  The wait was a little long but the torta was delicious.  I had tried a couple of different tortas but they just do not compare.  I do not know if it is the ingredients, the chefs, or the combinations they have, but there tortas put all the rest to shame.  It is a good things I do not live in Phoenix or I would gain about 50lbs on these tortas alone.  Anytime I am within an hour drive of this place I will have to stop to get maybe one, two, or even three tortas just to satiate my craving."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've been, but last week I got the chance to revisit and I finally had to write a long overdue review.   First and foremost, while it used to be a literal hole in the wall, this place seems to have expanded in both directions to take up more space in the mini strip-mall that it's nestled within. There are larger dining areas now and much more seating room, but the rustic and very much authentic atmosphere has definitely been kept alive. You really do still feel like you've been transported to another place when you set foot inside, and you'd be forgiven for thinking you had stepped in off a street in Mexico city somewhere. There's Mexican music playing and Mexican TV on the flat screens as well. This place definitely scores bonus points for keeping the ambiance as genuine as possible.   To get started on the food, we took in a Mexican Quesadilla, which was terrific. Fresh and perfectly cooked, it was well worth the price and kept us addled while waiting for the main course, but without filing us up and taking away much needed stomach space for what was to come.   As far as the entrees, while the menu is diverse and while they offer all manner of deliciousness, the main draw here has always been the famed tortas. There's a plethora of choices on the menu, and we agonized over it for a while, but ultimately my dining companions and I settled on the Del Ray for last week's adventure, and we were not disappointed!   The Del Ray is made with delicious fresh bread, beef, ham, pork sirloin, onions and omelet, plus some cheese, re-fried beans and chipotle sauce, among other things, and, while it sounds crazy or over the top, the end result is fantastically and sinfully delicious. This bad boy is stacked so thick that it's almost (but not quite) impossible to wrap your mouth around it and take a bite. I ended up copping out and using a fork and knife to piecemeal it (no pun intended).   As you might expect, you really have to be hungry to finish one of these tortas in a single setting, which is probably why they offer a \"mini\" version of most of them as an option. But, seeing as how it's \"go big or go home\", we had all opted for the real thing, and were not left wanting for more. I did finish the whole thing, but I skipped most of my dinner later in that evening. There are no sides other than potato chips with the Del Ray, but it's not as if you would ever need or want for more food than what comes on the plate.   I'm really glad I had the chance to revisit this place after so long, and I finally took the plunge and had one of their famous tortas. It's a bit out of my way, but if I'm ever in the neighborhood and looking for authentic Mexican street food, I will gladly pop into this place again. Absolutely fantastic and not like anything else, certainly not mainstream Mexican restaurant fare. If you haven't been, you definitely have to give this place a try."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Los Reyes! Had the Del Ray Torta... wow. Can never finish the Torta, but I get it almost every time i've been. Have also had the Hawayana Torta which was delicious as well. Their fresh squeezed juices are amazing and refreshing. Always a pleasure to come back!"}
{"text":"Saw the man v food episode so we dropped in. Many menu choices. Shared steak torte and carne esada burrito which were both delicious. They also have several fresh juices which was very surprising. V8 juice was very refreshing. Highly recommend and will definately be back ."}
{"text":"This place is always good. My favorite waitress is Veronica. Very attentive and always pleasant. Authentic food. Can't go wrong with these guys!"}
{"text":"I've been to the first location several times. People complained there about the building, the lack of ventilation and all that. Here they don't have those issues as the building is very large and open.   The food is great, not as good as I remember the same food being at the other location but I wasn't as hungry this time either so it may have just been me.   This place gave us tortilla chips and hot sauce when we sat down. I jokingly asked my wife where the potato chips were like we had at the other location. Later when I got my torta I got my potato chips and laughed about it. The guacamole was good but spicy. Most other places don't have spicy guacamole. So remember if the hot sauce is too hot eating guacamole to cool down your mouth will just make it worse.   The place wasn't very busy and the waitress was very nice and attentive. The food came quickly and you could tell was freshly made. I'll be back as this location is much closer to work and home."}
{"text":"Another fantastic place I never would've found if it wasn't for Yelp.  I had the Del Ray and Horchata...everything was better than expected.  Great prices, too!"}
{"text":"I ordered a plate of chilaquilles and they were okay the chips had a taste similar to pan dulce. It kind of ruined my meal but my son got a torta and it was really good the meat was lean and fatty pieces. I would return but order something that doesn't include tortillas chips."}
{"text":"Best tortas in the valley if not anywhere I have ever tried...yes, it's that good!! I will drive across the valley for this place. Everything is on point and seasoned perfectly, just can't talk highly enough about this place and excellent service at all three locations"}
{"text":"The bacon and cheese breakfast burrito is top notch.  The thick pieces of delicious bacon spread throughout to be enjoyed in every bite is a wonderful touch.  The cheese holds the the whole thing togther making every bite as good as the one before.  The salsa does well to compliment while not overpower the essence of the meal."}
{"text":"My sister is here from NY and she's on a Mexican food hunt. We went here and ordered a bistec burrito, king beef tacos, and a chicken quesadilla, and horchata.   The food was delicious! It was so authentic and flavorful! The flavors of the grilled opinion and jalepenos meshed so well together for a tasty kick in the mouth! I'm super picky about guacamole and I loved theres. It was creamy with the right amount of flavor. The horchata was ok, it was a little too ricey for my liking, but I liked that it wasn't super sweet.  My sister was very happy! I can't wait to try their tortas! The food was definitely 5 stars for Mexican food.  The prices were great! We got all that for about $30.00.  The only reason they lost a star from me is because the girls up front are lacking personalities. They are very pretty but very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Seriously the best tacos I've had in a long time... maybe ever.  I know they are famous for their tortas, but it was a late night stop and I didn't want to eat some beastly, 11lbs, torta.  So, I settled on the Bistec Encebollado tacos.    The flavor was spectacular and the meat was tender and easy to chew through.  I hate when you take a bite of a taco and pull all the insides out...   The only downside, IMO, is that I couldn't have a beer with my tacos.  It's not enough downside to warrant a 4 star rating, but maybe a 4.5 star if that was an option.  Check out this picture: https://instagram.com/p/vxJCgJNLs5/?modal=true"}
{"text":"This was a very large disappointment. Went because I saw the restaurant on Man v. Food and therefore assumed this would be a great experience. Wasn't busy when I went, got seated immediately.   Soon after the chips and salsa came, but they came in such small dishes that we ran out quick, very annoying to have to wait whenever salsa came. Also, they told me that they didn't have a spicier salsa, WHAT THE FROCK!? They don't serve alcohol, which isn't why I give them 2 stars but still disappointing cause I wanted a margarita with my torta.   Ordered the torta del Rey, again cause it was on mvf. When it came out it was delicious but it came with potato chips! Mexican restaurant serving me ruffles, you have got to be kidding me. They get two stars cause it wasn't authentic, and could have gotten much better Mexican food somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was craving fruit for breakfast, so when my boyfriend pulls up at a Mexican restaurant, I was a little skeptical. I was wrong! Fully admitting this. The big fruit platter with honey was so fresh and perfect. I had a mango juice that was literally pureed mango. Amazing.  Boyfriend had the Huevos Rancheros. Also mui bueno. I guess this joint was on Food Network for their gigantic burger. Man v.s Food.... That guy. So, funny thing is, his face is plastered all over the restaurant, including on the servers shirts!! It's cool that he could give them the spotlight they deserve!"}
{"text":"After watching Man vs Food, there was no way we were about to let another weekend go by without checking out this place! About a 5 minute drive from our place, we arrived around 7pm on a Friday night... it took us 10 minutes to find parking! That was our first indication it was going to be good! We were promptly seated in a cozy, nothing fancy table. Families to our left, couples to our right, Marc Anthony special blaring from the TVs, get the picture? This is one of the only places in Phoenix I've been to that doesn't serve alcohol, it didn't take away from the experience at all, but a good thing to know before going.  Our tortas were awesome awesome awesome! So reasonable, tasty, authentic.  Will be back again soon =)"}
{"text":"I'm still a fan, just a disappointed fan.  Popped in for a refreshing watermelon juice.  This time it was for a juice take-away and I got to watch the bartender prepare it and I discovered to my horror that they add sugar to the juice!  I can't believe it, now I'm going to have to remember to say no sugar, no azucar.  I should have known it was too good to be true.  Okay, I'll stop whining."}
{"text":"This location of Los Reyes is a bit run down and has a noticeable sewage-like smell, which sets a poor tone for your meal.  Once you get used to that you will find yourself in what is essentially a diner with a Mexican menu.  The tortas (sandwiches) for which they are named are okay, but the ingredients are not quality.  The ham slice which is on almost every torta is a slice of pressed ham pieces that could have come out of a can.  The breaded beef is a wafer thin slice of beef encrusted in soggy breading.  And the roll is shaped like a bolillo but is soft and crustless, although it is grilled to give it a bit of crisp.  It's not horrible, but it's not tasty either.    They could do a lot better."}
{"text":"Real good carne Asada tacos. Only get three for close to $10 tho. You Can get better deals at similar places like this in phoenix. Either way the food was great and the price was just decent. I would recommend checking it out based on the quality and flavor alone."}
{"text":"Yummy for the tummy. I was told to try this one to avoid the gringos invading the Sunnyslop location. Mission accomplished."}
{"text":"My husband has been talking about this place since he saw the episode of Man Vs Food that highlighted it. It didn't seem appealing to me, so I have been putting him off.  Next time dear.  Well, relationships are about compromise my friends, so eventually I had to give in and take the boy to Los Reyes. My expectations were not high.  I mean, tortas are sandwiches right?  Why get so excited.  And so what if Adam Richman attempted to give himself a heart attach here, I'm not big on the competetive eating circiut so a sandwich the size of my head is not my cup of tea. The store front is in a run down stip mall.  It proudly dispalys a picture of Mr.Richman.  It's a little skeezy.  I prepare myself for the worst. I have an issue with calling something with no tequila a margarita, or no rum a pina coloda.  So, maybe call 'em smoothies.  I am not impressed by the menu. My husband got the La Reyna.  Now, a little background, one of our most explosive fights to date involved what he calls 'sandwich sience'.  I was packing his lunch, 'cause I'm nice like that, and he instructed me that the way I make a turkey sandwich is completely wrong.  He tried to school me in the ways of 'sandwich science' I gave him the butter knife and told him to pack his own lunch.  When my husband recieved his torta I swear to God a single tear fell down his cheek.  The cooks at Los Reyes de la Torta are certified sandwich scientists.  The way they wrapped the chorizo in the egg was probably the most beautiful sight my husband had ever seen.  His expression trumped the one he had on our wedding day as I walked down the aisle.   His silence through out the entire meal, and the fact that I never got a bite, leads me to believe that the sandwhich was not only well constructed, but very tasty.  I had the alambre de camaron.  It was shredded shrimp, onions, cheese, jalepenos, rice, beans, and tortillas.  And you know what?  I was totally wrong about this place.  Seriously.  This was so good!  Adam Richman, you did me right. Los Reyes de la Torta, thank you for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today and was pretty danged impressed with my torta.  I had the Norteno, which was steak, cheese, tomato, avocado and a fried egg.  It was really tasty.   And quite a bargain at $6.99 since I could barely finish it.  Service was quick, friendly and excellent, even though it was the lunch rush and they were at capacity.  Pleasant atmosphere also."}
{"text":"This place was beyond my expectations. Friends recommended this restaurant and we decided to try it. Well, we were not disappointed. The service was attentive to our needs. Our waitress was always on top of refilling my husband's drink. After she took our order our food was brought to our table within 15 minutes. The tortas are delicious. There is a vast variety to choose from. These tortas are not your typical asada tortas you get in other places. The meats are very well cooked and they are served plenty. For all of you that don't like spicy just ask them to omit the chipotle sauce, since it is a little spicy. We will definitely come back another chance we get to travel to Arizona."}
{"text":"Don't worry about the culture shock. Give the place a try. The carne asada torta is solidly good.  The roll is fresh and soft and tasty. The meat is flavorfull.   Try the quesadilla on the hand/home made corn tortilla. Thr carne asada shines and the estillo del rey with extra cheese and goodies was super good.  Really different in a good way."}
{"text":"My wife and I are hailing to the Kings.  This place specializes in Mexico City cooking, and in particular, the torta sandwich.  LOTS of different kinds of tortas  My wife and I are vegetarians, and generally do not eat tortas.  However, there are a variety of other dishes here that will keep us coming back.  BIG portions!  CHEAP!  They don't serve enchiladas or chile rellenos, but they do have great burritos with a distinct flavor.  Their chocoflan also makes a fantastic sweet end to a meal.  If you're looking for authentic Mexico City flavor, this is the place and the locals know it.  Service is generally friendly, the place is clean, and there is always futbol on the television when you sit down.  Highly recommended.  Los Reyes de la Torta:  GOOOOOOOOOOOAL!"}
{"text":"Yummo!! 10x better than Paquime tortas! They are very generous with their meat portions in their tortas, rice and beans are excellent! Quesadillas are to die for. I have to stand up and applaud Reyes de la Torta for their mouthwatering aguas frescas! I've had watermelon, strawberry, and mango. I kid you not... Tastes like you're biting into the actual fruit! So refreshing!! They are served in a large goblet. If you're lucky you'll get a tiny umbrella :)   Place is somewhat small so it's a bit crowded if it's busy that day but I'm willing to look past it because of their delicious food!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Delicious and authentic. COME HERE ASAP!!   You definitely deserve this amazingness in your face. Good service and I recommend the torta del Rey for the ultimate cravings cure"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this restaurant from a new friend - I know of this great secret Mexican restaurant hole in the wall youre going to love.  So after all that anticipation and making it there, I can tell you she was correct.  This is a great Mexican eatery that I would like!  Unfortunately not yet, I did not enjoy the juice bar.  When I ate there, I was unreasonably hungry that I ordered the most gigantic Torta I have ever seen.  The Del Rey.  Holy heart attack on a plate batman!  I imagine even weeks separated from that meal, that I am still suffering from that explosion of food that I consumed.  And it was so unbelievably delicious that I cannot imagine that I would like to find any justification to repeat that transgression again  So why the 3/5 mark.  I think a lot of the food is greasy.  I would really prefer more heart healthy food to give a rating of great / excellent.  But perhaps very authentic to Mexico.  And I also love that the food is a SUPER value.  That is HUGE.  I hated that I was served potato chips with the meal, but perhaps that is standard with a Torta?  And I wanted so bad to ask the waitress to turn the channel to NFL football - but I did have enough sense that I was in a Mexican place, surrounded by Mexican families, that probably like watching their version of football."}
{"text":"Great mexican food, located in a crappy little strip mall but the food makes up for the location.  Nice pleasent atmoshere. Can be crowded but a good sign is that they are expanding their hours.  The Tortas are great, filling and reasonably priced.  The chocolate flan is sinfully delicious.  They have nice marqaritas and crappy beer to wash the food down."}
{"text":"This was a tough review.  They advertise Mexico City cuisine, to me it was pretty much Sonoran. The food was very tasty, I had a torta where the bread was dipped in a guarillo sauce. The problem with it was that it was all bread with very little filling, but I still loved the flavors.  The place is pretty big with not much crowd. I hope they make it. They would probably have been better off in a smaller establishment."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The waitresses are very attentive and the food is excellent with bountiful flavor.  I always get the pechuga asada but I have had several other selections.  All were excellent.  One of my top 5 places to eat in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Make no mistake, the Del Rey torta was tasty in its own right.  But with the hype built from Man vs. Food and other reviews it was bit of a letdown.  The refried beans worked well in the torta but the other components just seemed like a big mess of meaty ingredients piled high.  Good if your looking to munch, not so much if your expecting a top-tier torta.  Mexican food in Cali has still been surprisingly better even though one could assume AZ is closer and home to the real deal. (Like the sign Los Reyes says, Real Authentic Mexico City Food)  They also serve huge drinks without alcohol....wat Hopefully they acquire their beverage license soon."}
{"text":"The place was packed, so I opted for takeout, it was out in like no time flat. It was one of the burritos, but it was kinda salty."}
{"text":"I went here just because of Man Vs Food. And they really did live up to what I saw on the show. The food was flavorful and just great! Very filling too. The next time I'm nearby it is a must stop and gorge."}
{"text":"I was surprised when I walked in; I had the impression from the exterior that the place was much smaller, and I expected only a counter, and perhaps a few tables. Pleasant surprise to be seated, with a waitress to attend.  The menu alone made my mouth water, just envisioning all the dishes.  I chose the Del Rey Torta, simply for the meat content, which is considerable, and it has egg. You can't go wrong with egg on a meat sandwich.  When the sandwich arrived, I thought perhaps my meal, and my mother's, were on the same plate; it was huge! It could easily feed a small family. Or a large chef. :)  One thing that was odd; potato chips with my torta. I suppose it was ignorant of me to think that a mexican food place would have tortilla chips, but that's what I've been conditioned to expect. Upon reflection, potato chips are a more fitting accompaniment to a sandwich, contents of said sandwich notwithstanding.  The salsa that was served with the meal was phenomenal. Not too spicy, but a nice bite, with a slightly smoky flavor. Delicious!  The sandwich was, as the menu implies, a meat paradise, with egg. I can't recall for certain, but I believe there were 5 kinds of meat, including chorizo. You can't ever go wrong with chorizo.  The prices are very reasonable, even ridiculously low, given the volume of food.  The torta turned out to be much more than I could finish in one sitting, but I think I may have been intimidated. I will have to challenge the menu again, at a later date.  I would recommend Los Reyes to anyone seeking something non-traditional, in the Sunnyslope area. Its location on 7th street makes it equally favorably for those traveling from downtown, even on public transportation.  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I have been on a quest for good Mexican ever since I relocated to AZ and for the most part what I have found is mediocre food at best. I happened upon this place by reading reviews right here on Yelp. Although I am a fan of Man vs Food I have not seen the episode where this location is featured but apparently many others have. After reading the rave reviews I had to check this place out and let me tell you I highly recommend this joint.   The food: My friend and I ordered Taco's, a Quesadilla and the Del Rey Torta all of which were wonderful. The serving sizes are large. They are not stingy here. The presentation is nice also. The Del Rey Torta is huge and definitely needs sharing. We also ordered the Aguas Frescas in strawberry and mango and they were wonderful as well. If you are in the area definitely check this place out.  Note. This place gets packed. I visited at 11am on a Saturday and people were lined up to be seated. While my party was seated almost immediately service from that point forward was substandard but the food made the wait for service worth it."}
{"text":"\"Amazing tortas, super cute waitresses, very reasonably priced. Would have liked something other than potato chips though. Homemade tortilla chips maybe?  It's just a shame when they do one thing so well then completely phone in the rest of the plate by covering it in greasy out of the bag potato chips."}
{"text":"Living near East Side San Jose in California, I have high expectations when it comes to Tortas and Mexican food for that matter.   However, I feel that Los Reyes rides on their fame of Man vs Food albiet their torta portions are massive. Nothing here was spectacular to me.  I ordered the Del Rey Torta, from the rave reviews and I do tend to get signature items from restaurants since it should be a representation of who they are. Along with the torta I ordered a horchata.  The Del Rey is a massive torta that easily feeds 2, a half for each person. It comes with a side of chips and in the torta itself it has: avocado, pickled onions, tomato, egg encasing chorizo, hotdog, then cheese, brisket, and fried steak. Bread barely held every thing in and was a huge mess.  The torta had lots of textures, flavor wasn't as flavorful and didn't seem to be cohesive. It was just a lot of meat, cooked different ways in between two slices of bread. The chorizo didn't have that lovely red color nor heat to it.  The horchata was plain chalky, powdering and doused in cinnamon powder on top.  I packed half of my torta home since I couldn't finish my meal, but didn't even end up eating it afterwards. I didn't finish my horchata.  Service is decent. Typical of a family run restaurant, casual but timely. Pricing was okay for what it was, though I would get Mexican food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ok, you want quick and amazing food that takes you to your childhood, even if you're not Mexican? Reyes de la Torta will do it.   I had always heard about this place from the youth I worked with. They said it was amazing. Once I went, I was hooked.   You're going to get a completely different feel from this place. Yeah, it's in a strip mall; yeah, the hostess may stick you and your party at a table smaller than you're accustomed to; Yeah, there is soccer playing on the TVs instead of the news; .. but the food will make you not care about any of those things. Plus, they are always playing Salsa, not loud or rambunctious, trumpet-filled music. This adds to the experience as it makes me feel like I may be somewhere resembling my homeland of Colombia.   When you're asked for your drink order, make sure you ask for one of their aguas frescas... translation: fresh juice. I always get the Agua Fresca de Limon. It reminds me of the limeade I drink when I am back home in Colombia - this drink makes the whole experience worth it.  The chips and salsa are good, although you might want to watch out with the salsa if you're not a spice fan.   Ok, the restaurant is named the king of the tortas ... and you ask what is a torta?? To Mexican people, a torta is sandwich of meat, vegetables and anything else they may throw on there made on a hamburger-style bun - and that is what they're famous for -  that is why Adam from Man vs Food went there. But, I have never had their tortas simply because at Reyes you will enter a homemade-tortilla heaven that is like nothing else. These tortillas are amazing, from their texture, to their slight greasiness, to their taste, they are the best tortillas I have ever had.   So, in order to continue to eat the best tortillas ever, I always get the chicken quesadilla. Yep, it's simple, but amazing. You can also choose to get it \"Estilo del Rey\" which means they top off your quesadilla with more cheese ( white cheese, not crappy, yellow, greasy cheese), sour cream and green onions. That in itself sends this quesadilla into the history books.   Do yourself a favor and check out a truly unique restaurant tucked away in a strip mall just south of Hatcher on 7th Street. Make your way up to Sunnyslope and see what the buzz is about."}
{"text":"Antes era un buen sitio para comer,pero ahora entre los manejadores y las niñas que tienen por mesetas y los elevados precios prefiero gastarlo en otro lado en verdad,mal toso y carisimo"}
{"text":"I have never been to this establishment before much less ever heared of it till they opened up a location here in my neighborhood in Tempe. I decided to give it a try and was very satisfied. I ordered the Asada burro enchilada style with red sauce. Was very delicious. The beef was plentiful, not dry or tough. Was filled with beans, pico de gallo and fresh avocado. Great quality of food. The service was great. Waitress was very attentive. Food is reasonably priced for quantity served. The atmosphere is decent. Great family dining environment. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Love Los Reyes de La Torta! Great place to visit in Arizona! Food are huge and delicious! Waters are yummy and natural ... my Dominican friends loved it! Can wait to comeback to Phoenix and eat there !"}
{"text":"In town for a visit with family.  Searched Yelp for lengua tacos and chose Los Reyes.   Sad to report that the lengua was overcooked and dry..  The asada was better but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I went in expecting a tasty sandwich. This place delivered a masterpiece. I ordered the Del Rey and was not disappointed. After ordering, the food arrived within 15 minutes and was bigger than expected. The atmosphere is really casual, and the wait staff is very polite. I had no idea about the Man vs. Food episode when I visited, but the reviews on Yelp were enough to persuade me here."}
{"text":"Having been to the Phoenix location months ago, I brought my Mexican-food-craving girlfriend here the other night for a good, filling meal. We arrived and were seated despite the late hour (past 8pm on a Sunday), among two or three other occupied tables.    Our waiter, Oscar, was quick with the humor and very amiable. We had the (huge) Botana de Camaron (ceviche, cocktail shrimp, cucumber/tomato/avocado) plate - $12 - to start and enjoyed how refreshing and tasty that was before my Torta Del Rey (5 different meats, an egg, avocado, cheese, etc) - $10 - and my girlfriend's chorizo (made in-house) tacos - $6.25 - were served to the table*.    *Warning: bring a healthy appetite as all of these dishes are made to satisfy.    Finished off with a slice of Tres Leches cake on the house ($5 - Mail Coupon, Thanks Oscar!) and it was sweet dreams from then on...    TL;DR: Great spot for Mexican food in the Tempe area, excellent staff at this location... Come hungry!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and tried their steak torta.  Very simple but had a solid flavor.   Will be back to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Overall worth the time. The customer service was amazing and the food good. We had Tortas, pretty good. I have had better, BUT, they are good. They are generous with chips and salsa, very friendly, and I would highly recommend a visit.  We'll go back."}
{"text":"Mexico City Short Order Cooking in the Slope.  Today I'm having the Torta Norteña, a large lunch sandwich filled with grilled steak, onion, jalapeños, cheese, tomato, avocado and mayo chipotle on toasted crusty round bread. A very filling and delicious sandwich. 7.5  Dining is a combination of a sit down or take out. Lunch is very busy with the locals. And the place is open for breakfast, lunch, dinner.  Los Reyes de la Torta. The King's Sandwich."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum.  Yum.     The burritos here are awesome, as are the sope's, the service is super-friendly and it makes for a great quick lunch or dinner.      My girlfriend absolutely loves this place and I've become a fan as well.     Good food, good prices, good service, I'm there, and I'll be back, again and again.    Their flan is terrific and the selection of tortas and burro's is outstanding as well.     Give this place a shot, you won't regret it, beats the pants off the gringo fast-food establishments like Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I only give it 4 out of 5 stars, cause it's always crowded. Went here this past Sunday with the wife and kids. Food is always great, but they could do with expanding this place. The table was small and right in the middle of all the traffic."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves the best Mexican sandwiches in Arizona the restaurant is clean and the servers are fast you'll become a regular like me!!"}
{"text":"This place is super authentic from the music playing in the background to their friendly employees and cooks. I was pleasantly surprised that my strawberry agua fresca came blended with ice. I ordered the quesadilla de maíz with chicharrón. I squeezed the lines that came on the side over it which added a lovely citrus flavor to the delicious combination of fresh tortilla, pork and cheese. It was very big so I didn't finish the whole thing but wow was it good!"}
{"text":"I was never a fan of Mexican food.  I craved Mexican food about 2 times a year.  It wasn't until I had a torta from this place that I now want to go here every week.  Tortas... yum.  I always get the Rancheras C Papas, avocado, chipotle mayo, grilled beef and cheese on a toasted bun.  Hubby got the Del Ray Torta, (view photo).  Add a Coke from the glass bottle, you know the kind of coke that is made with sugar cane and NOT corn syrup, let's just say it's pure heaven in my belly.  Agua Frescas are delicious as well.  Watermelon, Cantaloupe, Mango, taste like your drinking the fruit itself.  So refreshing and light.  Don't forget the shrimp ceviche especial, at .99 cents, you will want about 10 more of these... will take a picture next time I go. The only downsides, they serve potato chips instead of tortilla chips.  No alchohol, but trust, once you bite into one of these filling sandwiches, those two faults are easily forgivable if not forgotten."}
{"text":"Wow. DELICIOUS!!! We've been here twice and the food is RIDICULOUSLY GOOD! The service was perfect and our food came out fast. They also play salsa music which is my favorite  love love this place and we will be coming more often!"}
{"text":"We were on the hunt for authentic Mexican Food for a visiting relative and we found it!  I googled \"hole in the wall Mexican restaurant\" but despite the rough neighborhood, Los Reyes is very nice inside.  It is clean and cozy and although I'm a \"clean freak\" I wasn't scared to eat here at all!    We had lengua tacos, cabeza tacos, and pollo tacos - everyone thought they were delicous (especially the corn tortillas)!  We also tried the shrimp ceviche tostada appetizers for .99 which was a great value and very tasty.  My daughter had the strawberry iced drink and the cheese quesadilla and she loved them both.  Usually quesadillas are greasy or dry and this wasn't either, it was really good.  We can't wait to come back here and try some tortas, the chicken salad - which looked delicious, and we'll try to save room for some of the amazing looking fruit salad.  Oh yeah and the taco prices were outstanding -- $6 for a big plate of 3 tacos and a \"salad\" which was lettuce, radishes, cucumbers, grilled onion and jalapeno.  What a gem..."}
{"text":"I dream of this place and talk about it constantly, as soon as I am done eating there i want to eat there again. If I didn't care about my weight or health I would eat there for every meal"}
{"text":"I'm willing to chalk my bad experience up to \"working out the kinks\", but still don't think I'll be back.  The good news: The place was packed on Friday night at dinner time. I got my food to go and the staff were very polite and accommodating. The food was hot and the salsa that came with it was great.  The bad news: I ordered a chicken torta for my husband and got beef instead. I ordered a vegetarian burrito for myself and there was A) a big piece of meat in it and B) a long hair in the center. That ended dinner pretty quickly for me.  Disappointing...I was hoping this would be a great new go-to local place."}
{"text":"Ok I'm not sure how to review this place because I think I made an error in my food order. I tried the Torta Del Ray as this seems to be the popular sandwich.  The positive: it was huge. Good choice if you are hungry.... And a carnivore.  The negative: huge mishmash of meats with flavors that weren't complimentary of one another. I did not understand the addition of hotdogs onto this sandwich- seems more like they are going for being eclectic rather than flavorful.  Salsa was rather bland. Our server was very attentive and friendly. Would go back for the smoothies- lots of fun, yummy non-alcoholic beverages.  Would be nice if they served alcohol too!!"}
{"text":"It was ok, so many varieties! Many tortas options for sure! I'd like to try something else on the menu. It was good but nothing spectacular!"}
{"text":"This place rocks, from the Tortas to the burros and ceviche. the ONLY dig I have is no chips and salsa. The salsa you get is awesome"}
{"text":"My husband and i visited Los Reyes de la Torta after hearing so much about it. The hubs went with whatever sandwich was on Man vs Food, and he struggled to finish it, but did! I was pregnant and couldn't even finish my Torta. Hubs was bummed they don't serve alcohol, and it was a pretty tight and noisy place that night, but I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Rad food. Only gripe is that the spice level is Midwestern mild. Aside from the tiny bottle of chile pequin hot sauce, there was hardly any spice to anything. That was great for the toddler in tow, because she could eat it all, and even slurped full spoonfuls of their salsa (which was odd).   Norteno de res torta is my favorite packed with steak and avocado. Chorizo is really well flavored too (and not at all spicy). But the quesadilla maiz en estilo del rey is the way to go! Gigantic homemade corn tortilla folded over melty cheese and your choice of filling, topped with cotija and crema and cilantro. So tasty.   I've tried their namesake torta del rey before, and only recommend it if you are getting the sandwich to go because that monster is unwieldy (unless you can unhinge your jaw like a snake) and will fall apart despite your best intentions. But then it turns into a sampler platter of every meat they offer? Anyway, at least at home your glutton ways are masked from sight, and you can get as bad as you wanna be on that behemoth torta.   Aguas are good too. Watermelon for life."}
{"text":"Def the best tortas in town. Got the nortena with shrimp and its ridiculous. Service is great very friendly,  ceviche tostads was also excellent. One the best Mexican spots in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have thoroughly enjoyed my experience. The restaurant is clean and staff is very friendly. They serve you chips and salsa while you wait for your food, but our meals were ready within 10 minutes! The portion size was also  very generous.The food was tasty and the staff always checked to make sure we were happy and our drinks were filled. My only wish is that they served alcoholic beverages. I will definitely be back!  Update: When I initially wrote my review it had just opened and they didn't have a liquor license yet. This place is great!"}
{"text":"They aren't called \"Torta Kings\" for nothing. If you want to taste a good Torta, check this place out. I've always had fairly large Tortas so I was surprised to see mini Tortas as an option. The place looks a little old, but that doesn't even matter if the food is good right? This place is worth coming back to in the future."}
{"text":"Perfect example of a great restaurant that lives in a crappy place. From the outside one might be scared to go in... it's in Sunnyslope for cripes sake! The tortas, and aguas frescas are both incredible. They blow a lot of other \"torta\" restaurants I've been to out of the water. The atmosphere is pretty bare bones, but they have done a nice job of making it feel welcoming and festive. There are always lots of kids there and lots going on, so be ready for a non-relaxing meal, but a very delicious one at that. The portions are enormous, and most people would be able to split one sandwich. Just watch your back around the area."}
{"text":"Adam disappointed me on this one!  Ok food!  Fruit desert was really good though!"}
{"text":"Originally came in because we heard it was good from a friend. Planned on getting a breakfast burrito to go. Tony convinced us to stay and have a seat. Aguas frescas are beautiful and delicious and the food was great! Glad we stayed! Very friendly environment. Great place! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Holy hell - it's best you just drop in and see what an amazing place this is for yourself. Seriously - WOW! This might be THE Phoenix restaurant to visit if you are from out of town."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. We branched out, but stayed with the mini-ceviche tostadas (can't miss those) for apps. Can't remember what the GF had (some torta - which is unlike her) and I had the pork belly street tacos. In addition to the Valentina's sauce on the table, there was some other one made with chiltepin peppers. EXCELLENT and actually non-gringoized.   I'll admit, I didn't finish the 3rd pork belly taco. It just wasn't crisp enough for me (the meat not the shell), but it was tender. The texture just wasn't suiting me at that moment in time. I think the contrast of the crispness and citrusy flavors of the ceviche was just too much for me to take in on that day. Sometimes you like black and white, other times, you want muted pastels, ya know what I mean? I'm pretty sure it wasn't their fault - so my song remains the same 5 stars.   This place rocks. Staff is fantastic, food is good, and I was intro'ed to a new bottled hot sauce...which I don't remember the name of but theres a pic of it on GF's phone. I'll add it later.  P.s. As many ppl have noted, the tortas are a bit on the large side. They offer mini versions of most (if not all). That's the way to go if you order apps or just aren't into eating a pound of meat.."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went here for the first time today and I must say this place was to darn good..i got the carne asada torta and its has been the best torta i have ever tasted..im sorry but tortas paquime has nothing on them..i also got the lime agua fresca and it was also really good"}
{"text":"What? I was so shocked by my experience here!! I feel like I was told that I won a new Audi R8 and went down to the dealership and was given a 1986 Club Car Golf Cart. Have my tastebuds died from all of my martini nights? Don't I know Mexican food? My foodie confidence has taken a massive hit. Do I start at Taco Bell and work my way back to the Big Leagues? Damn you Los Reyes!! I thought I should write down how I felt about my torta to start my process back.   Dear Carne Asada, you were treated with such disrespect and were left without flavor and Mexican flare! I was so looking forward to meeting you and seeing why so many loved you. Carne Asada, you're like all those girls in SoCal with the fake boobs and lips. Such a disappointment to find out! The one saving grace you have is your roll, but that roll only hides what you lack inside. Empty and souless!   Where do I go now? Where are the real Carne Asada's out there? Do I need to go south of the border? I know my perfect Carne Asada Torta is out there. Juicy, flavorful and every bit tasty! I'm going to keep looking, but I won't be fooled by Los Reyes again."}
{"text":"Literally the BEST tortas in Phoenix! And, the aguas frescas are AMAZING! It's one of my favorite places for sure"}
{"text":"The food here is not bad, tried the ceviche tostada and the quesadilla. I also tried the Aguas frescas in watermelon and mango which was very refreshing. The only complaint is the smell of the place. I was first seated next to the bathroom which had a strong cleaning solution smell, so I asked to be moved. Then was seated next to the area where they make drinks, which had a very strong musty smell. I would come back for the drinks and to try a torta next time."}
{"text":"I was excited to come after seeing this place on Man vs. Food. The torta on that show looked delicious and that is exactly what I ordered. It was fresh and tasted just like I thought it would, de-freakin-licious! Staff is friendly and place is kept clean."}
{"text":"They get 3 stars because I love their food. My family and I have come here for years, actually have always made it our stop before heading back to Cali. This last time we were their the service was HORRIBLE and was a bad experience overall, 1st the waitress brought half the drinks we had to literally tell her about the other half but after she dropped off the first half and disappeared for 10-15 mins ... we went thru our drinks quick since we had to share with the rest of the party at our table since most wee children, next they charge gratuity for over 6/7 people ... we split the bill and we still got charged, we asked and they said \"well we charge for children over 12 (it doesn't say that nowhere on the menu) we told her half the children on our table are under 12.... still didn't change it (mind you, I was going to leave a tip and I would of given her more too). Next they charged us for extra onion that we had requested not to be put on another plate already, they charged me over a dollar for 2 wedges of lime LITERALLY 2 small wedges. Finally the bill ... we handed her 2 credit cards ( one for each bill) she charged both bills on one credit card... and gave back each credit card with a receipt. Make sure you look at your receipts, the waitress at the front didn't even apologize or tried to fix it she just said \"oh\"."}
{"text":"Big value for your money here. The portions are delicious and gigantic. If you are looking for a low cost, family friendly place that serves authentic Mexican food then look no further. I ordered the Del Rey torta and I could barely finish half of it. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because it's in the Slope and the atmosphere is circa Filiberto's. Tasty food, great prices, and friendly service make it hard to beat. Repeat visits are guaranteed for our family."}
{"text":"Dishes sampled include:  Strawberry Aguas frescas naturals  Arnold Palmer  Del Rey - Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, sausage, chorizo, eggs, tomato, onions, jalapeño and avocado  Cubana - Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, tomato, onions, and avocado  Pierna - Pork sirloin with melted cheese, tomato, onions, and avocado  Chocoflan  Trying to get my family to visit divey ethic restaurants with me is generally difficult and yet when I suggested Los Reyes De La Torta they seemed agreeable; perhaps an effect of learning to trust me, perhaps due to the online menu, or perhaps seeing a resemblance to Cemitas Puebla in Chicago and arriving at the restaurant early in the lunch hour to find the place more than half full it would not be long before we were seated...in the small side room near the bar...with the only other Gringos in the restaurant...clearly segregated from the Spanish speaking clientele populating the larger front dining area.  At first a bit put off by this obvious isolation but quickly greeted by a pleasant young woman who proved both friendly and efficient we decided to stay, outcast or not, and what followed was actually a very impressive lunch at a bargain basement price.  Once (unbeknownst to us) featured on \"Man vs. Food\" it became obvious soon on opening the menu which items were considered signatures and with myself opting for the Del Rey while my mother and aunt went with similar, less gaudy options, plus a pair of icy mixed drinks similar in texture to the Slush-Puppies of my youth but far more delicious; the Arnold Palmer especially excellent with light bitter and a lot of sour without being overly sweet.   Moving on to the food, with each sandwich served on a fluffy and yeasty bolillo roll stuffed with flavorful meat and top quality produce, I can honestly say that every single bite of the Del Ray exceeded my expectations while both my mother and aunt seemed happy with their selections, as well.  Generally not one to order a sandwich as I find them monotonous after a couple of bites the Del Ray succeeded where so many others failed because each bite was slightly different from the last, some smoky, some spicy, some saline, and others creamy and rife with fresh avocado.  Large, easily enough to share, and certainly not for the faint of heart this is definitely the sort of dish that could have flopped and become nothing but a gluttonous mess but in reality, despite all the ingredients, never once did something seem unnecessary or overwhelming to the other ingredients...and as much as restraint probably would have been wise I enjoyed every last bite, a fact that *almost* made me glad they were sold out of their signature King Cake; though the dense \"Chocoflan\" of moist chocolate pudding cake meets smooth, creamy flan was quite rich itself.   With the Del Rey ringing in at a mere $9.50 I find it hard to believe that there is any place in the city offering more interesting Mexican food at a better value, though if there is I need to seek it out...right after I find some dining pals to head back to Los Reyes for Pambasos and Huaraches and some King Cake."}
{"text":"I came here for my own personal Man versus Food challenge to see if I can best the Torta Del Rey.   Read more to find out who won - was it Man, or was it Food?    Location & Aesthetics - Located in Phoenix on West Indian School Road.   The area is pretty busy as the restaurant sits right on the busy road (and bus route) and is close to an intersection as well.  I wouldn't advise parking on West Indian School road. I would suggest either parking in front of the restaurant (limited parking spots available) or at the rear.  The parking stalls in front are small and are for the handicapped so if you're driving a large truck or SUV, you'd be safer parking in the rear. The parking in the rear isn't all that fancy (isn't paved well, has potholes, etc.) and looks rather run down but it's the only choice (-1) If those spots become filled, I'm not sure what other choice you'll have to park.  I did manage to see folks parking along the sides of the restaurant as it looked as if there was stalls there, but again, if you're driving a large vehicle, it might be tricky maneuvering through the side to get to the rear. The restaurant is a large open area, inside, with lots of tables and chairs and adequate space between them.  There's music which wasn't too loud and was actually 80's music playing at the time, a favorite of mine.  There's flat screen TV's along the walls with the volume muted but the programming looked as if it was Sabado Gigante playing at the time.  Menus - The usual, given upon arrival and when you're seated.  Very large, self-explanatory, and easy to understand.    Service - The staff was nice, friendly, warm, welcoming, and bilingual.  We were initially greeted in Spanish, then after their faux pas - that we didn't speak a lick of Spanish - apologies were quickly issued. Staff answered our questions adequately and did check up on us frequently throughout our visit - very attentive!  Food - Upon being seated, it would appear that every table is given a complimentary bowl of chips and salsa.  Chips was fresh.  Salsa wasn't too thick, and though it appeared a little on the watery side, it was well seasoned and not too spicy. For drinks, we ordered the Aguas Frescas Naturales - iced water, sugar, and choice of fruit which came in a large glass with a miniature umbrella and looked like a large smoothie which was fresh and very tasty.  These drinks, it would appear, are made right there in a corner of the restaurant that looked like a little cabana. As for the main meal - I came here for the Torta Del Rey - Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, omelet, sausage and Mexican sausage come with tomato, onions, avocado, chipotle sauce, smear of refried beans and potatoes ruffles on the side, and was a huge sandwich.  All ingredients came together nicely and completed each other really well, it was fresh, very hot, and very tasty. Sadly, I have to say that food won this fight and I had to take the remainder home.  I definitely do like this place and it's got lots on the menu - things to try that will bring me back for sure!"}

{"text":"Incredible authentic Mexican sandwiches. The bread is light, the meat isn't greasy, and the aguas frescas are great!  The only drawback is that they are packed on weekend nights. But the service makes up for it -- helpful, positive attitudes."}
{"text":"Yes! I'm a fan. I've eaten here twice and never left hungry, that's for sure! Food tastes great, waitresses are nice. Ambiance is hole-in-wall.. but that's to be expected given the location. I'm just happy to pay so little for so much food! Everything I've tried (mine and off other plates ;) have been very, very tasty. I love the meat combos they put on every torta. Even the chips are fun. Great place. Highly recommended for cheap eats!"}
{"text":"Saw this on Man Vs. Food on Travel Channel. Yummy food and non alcoholic mexican drinks. The chips and salsa were not great but our entrees made up for it. Deliciousness. We have the Del Rey Torta, Shrimp Quesadilla and our kids ordered carne asada quesadilla from kids menu. Their pina colada is on point and their crema fruit drinks also very good. Overall all good experience."}
{"text":"This is a busy place!  Clean!  Simple!  Friendly service. They take away your plates fast.   They do provide the complimentary chips and salsa.  A nice salsa. Not too much flavor but fresh. I did ask for a spicy one. And it was not spicy and .... well .... had an interesting taste. Large large menu. Many many choices. Some expensive. Some cheap!  A good variety. We had a chorizo and nopales as well Grilled shrimp Tacos de Alambre de Camarón. Grilled shrimp mixed with bell  pepper, onions, bacon and melted cheese on top, salad, grilled  onions and jalapeños on the side mixed with bell  pepper, onions...  the chorizo was excellent. The Alhambre...no bacon!  What?  Where's the bacon. So so disappointed.  The salad was about a tablespoon size. Ha ha. I was ok with that. The jalapeños were grilled and excellent.   A busy place. Large menu with simple flavors."}
{"text":"Los Reyes De La Torta is excelente! Did i say that right?  This hidden gem always gets good reviews from my friend and now I can see why. The staff is pretty friendly and the atmosphere feels festive. We were interested to come here because Guy Fieri also gave his stamp of approval.  The menu has tortas, lots of appetizers and colorful drinks. I ordered a horchata that came out in a HUGE goblet. Our friends pina Colada had a umbrella in the drink like it was his bday!  I enjoyed the shrimp appetizer it was really fresh! It was a small bite the only gripe is I wish I could have more!   Our large torta sandwich came and we shared. Guys with big appetites will enjoy this this place because they are very generous with portion sizes.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is TERRIBLE. After bringing a group of 10 people here for dinner, I felt embarrassed to have made visited this restaurant. First of all, the place smells of old frying oil, and is incredibly disorganized. Despite calling ahead to accommodate our party, they took over 20 minutes to sit us down right in the middle of the restaurant... not the best place. Not only did it take over 10 minutes to have our order taken, but then all of our drinks were wrong and they kept bringing extra drinks we never ordered.  Hoping this was a 'drink station mistake', we anxiously waited for our tortas. The would bring one torta at a time, which made it awkward for our large party, and every single sandwich was dry and lacking flavor. The drive through the sketchy area of town to get there, coupled with the subpar/overpriced food makes me not want to visit this place again. Steer clear!"}
{"text":"One of the most delish mexican food places I have visited since moving to AZ more than 13 years ago. It takes quite a bit to please me. I always say I cook better at home. I've been here a few times and I just love the selection and the tortas are amazing. I will continue to be a client for many years."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed lunch here. The tortas were very unique and delicious! Full of flavor very good combinations. I had a norteña torta, it was packed with avocado and cheese. Yum!! The USA torta was good too.   Our waitress was very friendly. Always smiling and making aure we were doing good.   Boo-hoo no beer is sold but its not a big deal, get an  agua fresca or a liquado instead, those are great as well!  Overall you have to appreciate this place for what it is, a local torta restaurant, well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today for the first time after hearing so many great things  about it. The food is enormous but still delicious. I was worried that with being on TV (Man Versus Food, a personal fave of mine) that the food would be more of a gimmick and less of a diamond in the rough. Much to my party's delight, everything we ordered was tasty and well prepared. The neighborhood of Sunnyslope is a bit rough around the edges, but this is definitely a good find and a reason to visit.  For a business/work lunch, food was quick, service was polite and we ate a ridiculous amount of food. I can't wait to try a couple of the other amazing looking tortas!"}
{"text":"Good Tortas...a tad bit on the expensive side. Quick service and excellent traditional Mexican drinks."}
{"text":"You know you hit the jackpot at an ethnic restaurant when you are a minority.  I had the pork belly tacos and my husband had the chicken tacos.  Very good.  Very fresh.  We had a good seat - right next to the kitchen and we were able to see all the food going out to the tables.  It all looked good.  Come with a big appetite and you will leave happy and full!"}
{"text":"We love taking friends and family here when they visit Phoenix, as you simply don't come across gems like this on the East coast. They're known for their tortas, which are simply phenomenal, but they also have great options for breakfast. They don't have a liquor license, so there's no margaritas to pair with your massive sandwiches, but they do have a wide variety of fresh juice options. This place is super authentic and the staff is very friendly and quick to bring your food and top off your drinks."}
{"text":"Los Reyes de la Torta has the best Mexican sandwich as advertised. The deluxe torta with a lime agua fresca is just about all you need when you're hungry and want some great food. Not fancy, but it's clean, the people are friendly, the kitchen is open (and again, clean) and best of all the food is really good. The interplay between the meats on the torta are wonderful. The place doesn't look like much from 7th Street - in fact we drove right past it the first time - but turn in and enjoy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We're back in Phoenix this weekend, ready for some good food and after seeing this place on Man vs. Food, we wanted to be bold and try the Big torta!  We ordered one to share and I still couldn't eat the whole thing.  The King Carlos V is the largest sandwich I've ever had, and the layer upon layers of food is endless.  There is breaded chicken, beef, ham, egg, cheese, avocado, tomato, lettuce, mexican sausage, mozzarella and it goes on and on.  It is served with chips and by cutting it into smaller bites, I was able to tackle some of it, but eventually, I had to abandon the bun and just pick apart the layers.  I finally surrendered and quite altogether.    The sandwich was really good, the different layers eaten together were good, however, it is just way too much.  There is a large menu with many other delicacies awaiting another visit.  Good service, very crowded, many locals!"}
{"text":"Holy shit my mouth is so happy. Tacos were excellent and authentic, not to mention loaded with meat and cheese. The aguas frescas watermelon was so good I swear I heard angels sing when I drank it. You should definitely go try it, all these reviews are no joke man this is the place to get down on some Mexican food"}
{"text":"Once again Yelpers you didn't lead me astray.  The food is amazingly fresh and wonderful and plentiful.  I had the shrimp tacos, others had the carne asada tacos, the Del Rey, carnita quesadilla, and the chicken torta.  All loved the food and  the agua frescas were amazing.   YUMMM....We all died of a food coma for an hour or two after...I will be a regular of this restaurant."}
{"text":"I read about Los Reyes on Yelp earlier this year and have really wanted to try it. My boyfriend and I went on Friday and we REALLY enjoyed it! I used to be obsessed with tortas when I lived down in Guadalajara, so I was especially excited. I ordered a torta with chopped steak, onions, peppers, cheese, beans, avocado and more. Delicious! I could only eat half (half is about the size of a burger). I also got an horchata - really refreshing after the spicy-ness of the peppers and hot sauce.   My boyfriend got a steak torta and a Mandarin Soda. He LOVED it. He somehow managed to eat the whole thing!   Definitely want to go back and try more of their food and fresh juices. Highly recommend Los Reyes!!!"}
{"text":"Mexico City food rather than typical Arizona Mexican food. FRESH food, variety of choices, large portions, reasonable prices. Restaurant is immaculate and every staff member greets you! Our waiter, Tony, was excellent. We will return to try this more authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Place was slammin! Had the Ranchera torta with carne asada and it was off the hook. Salsa was on point...so come get it!"}
{"text":"real Mexican food, price moderated, clean and neat atmosphere, service excellent, well deserved review"}
{"text":"Laura and I went in to Los Reyes de la Torta for lunch on our day off yesterday.  We were both really hungry as we hadn't ate all day and it was a good thing because I didn't even finish my plate.    I ordered the cantaloupe agua fresca and the tinga quesadilla.  The agua fresca was awesome full of flavor and even a very nice presentation.  I am a huge fan of chicken tinga so anyplace that serves it gets an A in my book.  This place is another perfect example of that.  The quesadilla  was awesome lots of meat inside along with a great sauce and cheese on the top.    This place rocks and I will be back for sure.  Laura even made the comment this is the first place she has ate at that makes her feel like back home in Mexico flavorwise."}
{"text":"JD invades AZ Day 2:  While researching places to eat on my AZ vacation,  I came across the \"Man vs Food\" episode where he visits this exact Los Reyes De La Torta (LRT). I was really curious, but a bit hesitant especially after that whole Mexico Bakery (MB) debacle (http://www.yelp.com/biz/mexico-bakery-san-jose-2?hrid=D-vOUl2zj5fBOhbOBHRFjg) --but I sacked up; grabbed my brother-in-law (BIL); headed over there; and ordered two of their infamous Torta Del Rey to-go.  Torta Del Ray- This thing is a beast and makes the massive Torta at MB look like a midget. They really should call it the \"Regadero De La Cocina Torta\" (aka Kitchen Sink) because it's got everything you could imagine--and then some! There's Ham, Pork Loin, Beef Milanese, Hot Dog, Chorizo, melted cheese, Queso Fresco, Chipotle Salsa, Omelet, Tomato, Onions, Avocado, and Chipotle sauce. *Whew!* Now that's a mouthful, both literally and figuratively--and to top it all off they give you a handful of Ruffles chips (in case the Torta isn't enough food for you). The Torta itself was pretty good; I think I'm finding out that I'm not a fan of too much stuff on my sandwiches. I think the taste of everything gets muddled up in there and you get some serious mouth confusion. On the plus side, I really liked their Red Salsa; it went great on the Torta and the Ruffles. If I ever go back I'm definitely ordering one of their simpler Tortas. 3.5*  Horchata- I liked LRT's Horchata; it had a good flavor without the chalkiness that you can sometimes find. 4*  Service & Ambiance- We ordered our Tortas to-go so we didn't experience the wait-staff, but the two people at the front where we placed our order were very nice and friendly. LRT is located in a pretty Ghetto-Fabulous section of Phoenix; upon our first arrival we were greeted by two borrachos chilling in the lot and a couple of other suspicious characters just \"hanging out\". I'm not sure if I'd pay LRT a visit at night, but during the daytime I think it just adds to the experience. 4*  Value- While $9.75 is a hefty price to pay for a sandwich, realistically you can easily share this with at least one other person. 3*   Admittedly, it was a little contrived to seek this place out because I had seen it on a TV show, it was definitely fun to do once. If I lived in the area I seriously doubt I'd make the Torta Del Ray a regular item in my rotation. However, I can almost guarantee that their other more reasonably-sized Tortas would be much better. I'm gonna try to stop in one more time before I head out of town, but until then LRT gets a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Sometimes you are just craving Mexican food and want to try someplace new. Well I wouldn't recommend this place. They do not serve alcohol, which is weird because who doesn't want a margarita with their tacos? The menu is very confusing and even shows drinks, but they are all non-alcoholic. The service was very slow and not very good. The whole experience was mediocre, which is disappointing because I love Mexican food. A LOT!"}
{"text":"At one point I would have given this place 4 or 5 star because I enjoyed their chicken tacos, flan, especially their tres leches cake, and they've always been consistent with taste and quality. The taco consistency went down. It got sloppier and the seasoning or amount of seasoning suddenly changed.   The tres leches cake on the other hand is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT cake. I loved going there simply for that cake. I didn't mind paying $5+tax for it. The new cake is cloyingly sweet, has some jelly in between the cake layers. Then  they decided to put walnuts on top of the cake. Good lord it's gross. I dunno if the walnuts were bad, but I'm done with this place. I'll find somewhere else to get my tres leches cake."}
{"text":"I am not sure what all of the hype is about. Based on Man vs. Food recommendation we had the Torta Del Ray sandwich and it was VERY disappointing.  The meat was dry, sausage was not browned and it was totally tasteless. I think the cook neglected to season the meats. My buddy ended up dumping salsa on his sandwich and I put hot sauce- anything to get flavor. Don't waste your time on this one. MAJOR disappointment.  On a positive note, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"These people care about the food the service was excellent the presentation was spot on"}
{"text":"My friend Bill and I decided to come down here and check this spot out.  I have had it bookmarked for awhile now, and decided to knock it out this past Friday.    We both went with their signature sandwich, The Torta Del Rey.  I went with a full, and Bill went with a half.  This torta comes loaded to the brim with, to put it blunt, a shitload of stuff!  This thing comes with ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, omelet, sausage (hot dog) and Mexican sausage (chorizo), tomato, onions, avocado, chipotle sauce and a smear of refried beans.  Yes, all that stuff comes on this beast!  It is served with a side of Ruffles chips.  Here is how it was.............  Torta Del Rey- Wow!  This thing was massive!  It was incredibly visually appealing!  I took a bite into it, and was pretty satisfied.  Even though there are a ton of meats in this sandwich, you could pretty much pick out each individual flavor.  I liked that aspect of it.  I didn't like a few things either, though.  First, the sandwich was just way too damn hot.  I should have let it sit for a few minutes. Second, I would probably get it without the hot dog and sausage.  They wrapped those up in the omelet/egg.  I wound up taking off the egg pocket on my 2nd half of the sandwich.  Even with the chipotle sauce, it was still a bit dry.  I ate the whole thing, along with the chips, and was stuffed to the brim.  Wasn't great, wasn't horrible.    Overall, I was glad that I made it down here.  I don't know if I would order the Del Rey again.  I would probably try out something else, something more simple like a plain carne asada torta.  I think I almost set myself up for failure though, too.  I have had many tortas from Wash Mobile Tortas down in Tijuana, and those are the best, and my all time favorites.  No other torta can compare. Service was friendly.  The price was a bit steep though, too.  The sandwich was huge, but even then, I don't think it justified the almost $14.00 price tag (after tip) for lunch.  Am I coming back?  Yeah, someday I'm sure I will make it back down here.  I'm not rushing to get back though.  A-OK.  3 stars."}
{"text":"Best mexican food in phoenix! I recommend this place to anyone who wants an excellent  meal!"}
{"text":"I'm in Los Reyes de la Torta!  I'm in, Los Reyes de la Torta!  No typos there my eagle eyed friends...I am happy to report that both are (in fact) correct!  Differences without a distinction!  I was reading a thread about over-hyped places the other day, on Yelp.  I wrote something pleasant, but inane and in my haste (doing four things at the same time), I misplaced a comma!  Other sharp-eyed correspondents pointed that out to me...and I'm as grateful for the unsolicited correction as I can be!  After lamenting my typo (and the very fat fingers that I use to type these little stories), I thought to myself \"Donald, why not go to one of these very hyperbolically reviewed establishments and see if you can find that comma\"?  After all, it has to be somewhere.  So, after a busy morning, what with working, building, producing, running, meetings, making money, special \"mommy/daddy time\" with the Beautiful Carin and so much more (you know...\"the usual\"), it was off to LRDLT for a Tuesday Retox.  I met a buddy (who has here been before and raves about this place) and I was hopeful (so very hopeful) that the place would live up to the hyperbole.  I couldn't have taken that disappointment, along with losing my comma.  I needn't have worried...the Del Rey Torta was everything I could have hoped for...and much more!  The whole menu looked terrific and I noticed that the joint was completely packed (even well before the normal lunch hour got into full swing).  Everyone in the place seemed to be happy and enjoying themselves...and why not, the food is cheap and tasty...the service is pleasant and efficient...what more could I ask of lunch?  Furthermore, the aroma coming from the kitchen was heavenly (always the first indicator, for me), so I settled in and ordered the King Torta...with a diet coke.  As my lunch friend says...Sofa King good!  And Sofa King huge...certainly the portions are large enough for a small family to share (I saw multiple examples of people sharing lunches).  But I do not share...if anybody tries to grab my victuals, they're going to hear angry growling and see bared teeth.  Especially when the grits are this good!  On a happy, sunny Tuesday morning, I found that some places really do live up to the hype.  And while it isn't Keen's Chop house, or Boulevard, LRDLT is Five Stars for what it is!  Oh, after lunch...I found my misplaced comma!  \" , \"  Insert it with care!"}
{"text":"I visited a handful of times and have thoroughly enjoyed everything I've got. The tortas and tasty as well and the burritos, tacos, chips and salsa. The ceviche was also a highlight for my wife and I. Complimentary chips and salsa are always welcome. The staff is friendly and service is responsive. The dining room is clean and there are a few tvs with sports on that I enjoy. This plac will definitely leaving you wanting to return to try more and more menu items. I know I'll be back again."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where I go a long time without visiting... probably because I over-ate and decided I didn't want to do that to myself again....  Then someone visits and I suggest this place.  We go... and as soon as I take that first, messy bite of a torta (any of their tortas... they're all delicious!), I can't stop myself from finishing the whole thing.  No leftovers.... regardless of how big the sucker is.    And the drinks!  they come in these massive cups and they're so tasty!    And then I hate myself afterwards because I'm so full and I gorged myself like a pig.    Until next time!  After a few weeks of working out...."}
{"text":"Dive Restaurant with Incredible Authentic Mexican Food   The Asada & Pollo Asada Tortas are excellent.  I saw this restaurant on Man v. Food on the Travel Channel.  Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"This place serves amazing tortas!!! I guess that's why the restaurant name has tortas in it. I came here with a big group of people and we all got a variety of dishes which were delicious. The server recommended the del rey torta which i got and I have to say it's really good if you like tasty meated sandwiches. I got the mini size and it was still so big that I could barely finish. You get to choose a side of salad or potato chips with your meal. The size of the torta is huge and they really stuff up the meat so you will definitely be full when you finish the meal.   I also got the strawberry smoothie which comes in a fancy cup and it was good. One thing I wish they could change about the menu is add alcohol to the drink menu. Their drink menu is all non alcoholic and I can see the customers come in families so perhaps this is a family friendly restaurant. But I still if they serve alcohol, they will have a lot of business.  The price of all the dishes were super reasonable for the portion we get. The servers were nice and restaurant is huge with lots of tables. We came in an hour before it closed and stay passed the closing time and they did not complain or rush us. Overall, great place for authentic food!"}
{"text":"Fun!  That's how I'd describe our experience at Los Reyes De La Torta.    Picture it - a lazy scorching hot Sunday in Arizona. We had already met our beer quota for the weekend and needed to dry out.  What to do besides Netflix or DVR?  My fiance suggests a cheap lunch at Los Reyes de la Torta.  Sold!!  Forget the fact that, yes, we DID find out about this restaurant via Man vs. Food.  It just seemed too tempting NOT to try it since Adam actually visited a restaurant in the 602!  We knew what we were getting into - a huge torta big enough to feed two!  We were ready!  Upon arrival - it looked packed!  Although located in what people might describe as a \"sketchy\" area of town, we never felt that vibe.  Just an eclectic mix of people, families, couples, kids, milling around outside.  We thought for sure we were in for a long wait!  Wrong!  First off - the restaurant is actually bigger than it appears.  There were three different sections for diners to eat.  We were seated immediately at a table near the entrance which suited us just fine. We already knew what we wanted.  One Torta del Rey please!    We decided to share it - I knew I just wanted a taste (my body is not accustomed to that much meat at one time).  The waitress took our order in a matter of seconds.  Such prompt, and friendly service!  We knew it must be an authentic hangout because a bulk of the wait staff spoke broken English.  always a good sign - like when I go to an authentic Chinese Restaurant.  I expect the staff to be incomprehensible.  I also look for other Asians in the restaurant as validity.  Los Reyes de la Torta definitely seemed like a locals spot - very authentic - which made us like it even more.  So - within about 5 minutes - our order was up!  And OMG was it great!  Huge torta - layered with meats.  I won't list them because most of our fellow yelpers already have - I just want to say that the flavor was amazing!  Such a good deal and so much meat for only $7.99.  Served with potato chips and two different kinds of salsas (green and red) red being my favorite because it was spiciest.  Very very good salsa.  The awesome thing about sitting in the main area by the entrance was that we had full view of the kitchen.  My fiance and I stared in awe, watching how fast the chefs were able to churn tout the food.  Everything was made fresh - we wondered how many of the Torta Del Reys they actually cook each day! Most people ordered that.  The reason for the four stars is because although the sandwich is HUGE as is - there is an option for extra meat for a cost.  Of course - this is what had been served to Adam in the Man vs Food episode.  There is  a definite difference as to what was aired on TV.  We decided not to order extra meat this time around - and to save that for a time when we could go with a group of people.  Again the torta is meaty enough as is, the extra meat version be fun to do as a challenge with friends.  Overall a super fun time and a great experience.  Fast, friendly service and good fresh food.  Oh - and clean! Super super clean!  That was a surprise.  I've been to enough sketchy Chinatown restaurants and have become somewhat immune to that dirty feeling - but this restaurant was definitely well kept!  They also serve a huge selection of frozen drinks (both alcoholic or virgin) that I want to try next time!  Definitely give Los Reyes a try - or if you want a fun experience - take a group!  The food alone is entertaining enough!"}
{"text":"My boss took a few of us here on 07-15-10 because he saw it on Man vs. Food. We ordered their famous Del Rey Torta and this meal was huge and absolutely delicious! I was only able to consume half the sandwich, you can surely bring a friend to split the meal. I would definitely go back and order this again. They also give you a red and green salsa. The red one is great cuz its got some heat after you keep eating some. Their ceviche is wonderful too!  I also had their flan, but I wasn't a big fan of it. I make my own and mine is creamy and sweet. Theirs is...the opposite.  Our order of water took awhile. The one in the group that ordered Coke got their drink first, probably cuz they paid for their drink...joking. But I ended up requesting to get our waters then they brought it.  Overall, it was a great experience and I definitely need to stop for the Del Rey Torta again and bring some friends."}
{"text":"For the fun of spending the scorching Arizonian summer, the 4 of us carpooled to the Eastside for the casual \"Adam-Richman-was-Here\" experience.  His image on the front glass wall casted no doubts that this was the place where he had loyally bitten through this legendary Del Rey Torta ($9.50)--the primary purpose of our eating venture that we made 2 orders (1 per couple) of these behemoths.  Additionally, we were voracious & interested for the down-to-earth-looking Chilaquiles ($7) & Cocktel de Camaron Chico ($10.99), plus their Aguas Frescas Naturales ($3.50) deemed critically appropriate during Phoenix's triple digit inferno.  Speaking of heat, that unrefined watermelon drink lovingly quenched our parched mouths &, particularly, the not-at-all watery & un-syrupy consistency convinced us that it was from a legit melon--just a pinch of sweet to enliven it a little more.  Meanwhile, the Chilaquiles--which (again) the arrangement of salsas & cheeses underneath the fried tortilla chips resembled the colors of the Mexican flag--proved very plentiful, &, from the SoCal's palate, turned out to be quite tasty, specifically their Cotija cheese & perfectly cooked eggs over easy.  The Shrimp Cocktail may look, well, soupy, but there was an adequate, lime-tastic amount of these medium-sized, decent crustaceans for DL, Kurdy, Angela & me to munch w/ the quirkily addicting fried tortilla.  At last, we attempted to dethrone the Del Rey Torta, flamboyantly composed of ham, melted cheese, breaded beef, refried beans, hot dog meat, chorizo omelet, tomato, onion, avocado & (finally) chipotle sauce.  Attempting to open at my widest, I managed to bite probably 3/4 of the stacked ingredients.  Obviously flavor-wise, altogether did equate into candid yummy-ness, & the overall textures were pleasantly soft, tender, & thankfully not unctuous.  However, if deconstructed (b/c we inadvertently let 1/2 of the torta spill on our plate), some individuals--like the beef & beans--were bluntly plain on their own.  In other words, they truly need to be eaten in unison for a king-like, gluttonous feel.  Plus, potato chips were served w/ these Sammies, but the reminiscence of plain old Ruffles left me only focused on the signature item.  Of course you're wondering if we finished the Rey; I believe I annihilated half of that stack.  We finally ended our eats w/ the surprisingly enormous Chocoflan ($4.50), which I honestly didn't care for & gladly permitted DL to finish the rest of it =P.  Service was certainly impressive even for the royals: very pleasant, accommodating, and attentive at their best.  It may be a 3.5-starred feast, but if I am in the mood for that fruit-tastic potion (which comes w/ other fruits & horchata) & a torta, I'd positively come back--this time begging for the traditional or their saucy version called the Pambasos."}
{"text":"First time here this past Sunday and I ordered a juice called la más fresca I think and it was super lemony and great then I got the torta ahogada and the carnitas inside we're cooked PERFECT. Nice and crunchy I loved every bite of it. Then I took the fresas con crema to go and they were also AMAZING. Great service as well I recommend this spot."}
{"text":"We've always had GREAT service here - the wait staff is extremely child-friendly. Our waiter the other night brought our daugter a cup of water with a pink umbrella in it and told her he made it special for her because she's a special little girl. Unbelievable! You just don't get that anymore in restaurants!  Anyway - we were seated immediately upon entering on a Friday night. Surprised the place wasn't more packed than it was... we've been here before and love their food.   Salsa was immediately brought to our table and we're big fans of their salsa. Simple, flavorful and authentic.   I almost always order the small Norteno Torta - I adore the flavor and texture combinations and their bolillo bread is so soft and fluffy and flavorful!  My little girl ordered the hamburguesa (or as she calls it, a hang-gubber). We each managed to sneak a bite of it - and it's a mighty fine burger indeed! I may one day try just a burger!  My husband asked our water to \"go authentic\" on him - he left his choice up to the waiter and our waiter did NOT disappoint. A plate full of seasoned beef, some nopales, rice and beans and fresh tortillas. He loved it.   Big fans - we'll go back again and again!"}

{"text":"Great food. Jalapeños are on everything tho, so if you're sensitive, be sure to request without.  ***Would not recommend Grubhub delivery. They took over an hour & food was all room temp when it arrived. We reheated everything, and i bet it's much better when consumed freshly prepared :("}

I took a peek at the menu but I knew what I was there for Torta de Rey!!!       It did not disappoint it was a monster it has everything you can think of stacked inside 5 different types of meat cheese avacado tomato onion. It truly is a meal fit for a King. Im planning a trip to Arizona in July for the All-Star game and I know I will making a couple trips to Los Reyes."}

Upon arrival of this beast landing in front of me i downed a tasty coca cola from the recycled bottle. My g/f ordered the torta norteno and pinapple water. the water was very good and tricked me into getting the watermelon water once that was gone. Both flavored waters very falvorful but could be server colder.   On to the tortas....The del ray was exactly what i wanted. So big i couldnt even get a solid bite out of it. All the different elements coming together to form a magical flavor party in every bite. The red and green salsas were very good too and added some spice and kick to the torta. The norteno was a simpler and less beast like torta but was very good as well and would get it next time if im not forced by hunger to order the del rey again.  Overall this place is a hidden treasure in sunnyslope and will now be on my list of go to places"}
{"text":"This food is legit.  We ate the Alambre de res, which is a flour quesadilla with chopped beef with bell peppers, onions and cheese and the Torta Nortena Torta,  grilled steak, onion, jalapenos, melted cheese, chipotle, tomato, avocado and mayo-chipotle dressing.  Both were fantastic.  The menu is extensive and there really is so much to try.  These 2 were fairly basic and clearly something a novice would order, but it was a good start and a great choices for a first timer.  I want to try the tacos and other tortas that have all sorts of amazing options like ham, chorizo, eggs, avocado and much more all in one torta.  Some of them were so high, I thought for sure the tops were going to fall off and the people eating them were going to bust the button on their pants- no doubt."}
{"text":"El milanesa sandwicho es muy bueno!  That was my inner Spanish-speaking voice said after eating the breaded steak sandwich at Los Reyes de la Torta (which, loosely translated means \"Reyes of the Sandwich\").  I tried a couple of other sandwiches too (thank you for that opportunity, Groupon!)... but my inner voice was not nearly as pleased with those sandwiches as it was with the milanesa.  On a different note, I was approached in the parking lot by a homeless-looking man asking for change... but I don't hold that against this place, as I am sure he was just trying to scrounge up enough pesos to afford a milanesa sandwich to go with his 40 oz Dos Equis!    !Arriba arriba!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite authentic Mexican restaurant. The tacos are amazing. It a little hole in the wall but worth a visit! And just FYI, no alcohol is served here."}
{"text":"Very good food! We had the Steak Mexicana and the Chicken Norteno with sour cream. Both were magnificent with the meats tender and flavorful and the rolls grilled perfectly. The slaw was a bit dry but I just threw in some of their green sauce which was the best I have ever tasted. Going back for sure! Service was adequate."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant! I prefer seafood and typically l don't find it on our regular Mexican hangouts.  I end up have Chile relleno. Not today! There were many options for pescatorians and vegetarians, woot woot!  For my first time here l picked the ceviche tostada and a side of beans. Ron got a chicken quesadilla. We were both amazed how good everything tasted! Our waitress and hostess were so helpful, friendly and attentive.  Prices are  $ food tastes $$$. We will be back soon to explore their menu further!"}
{"text":"This place was not good. The salsa with the chips was so hot I almost died, there menu was so unorganized and crowded I had to tell the server to decide for me. When I did get my dish ( I ordered the shrimp plate) the cheese on top wasn't melted it was ice cold, the rice was white and premade and tasted like plastic and the guacamole tasted like it was scooped out of a premade store bought container. I love Mexican and I will never ever eat there again."}
{"text":"About as authentic as it gets. I was the only gringa in the restaurant where I had a asada quesadilla, which came with salad and jalapeño and limes. Great service, and great energy! I'm glad I was walking up 7th street and saw the Mexican families streaming in!"}
{"text":"BEST TORTAS IN AZ  Growing up in north Phoenix I saw this place grow from a hole in the wall to buying the two businesses next door to expand this location. Not to mention Adam from the Travel channel's Man Vs. Food has been there as well. Honestly take it from a Mexican who eats a lot of tortas all over Arizona and even some of the other menu items are great! Love to show my friends this place they always end up going back cause they can't get enough!"}
{"text":"LOS REYES THE LA TORTA OPENED UP A LOCATION IN TEMPE AND IT IS AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL!!! Tempe just hit the jack pot, growing up in north Phoenix I loved Los Reyes and I was happy to see that they opened one up here, I was a bit skeptical to try it since I thought it would lose its authenticity but it is even better tasting and the location surpasses the original by a lot! Very great authentic tortas from Mexico City with a great environment and even the other menu items other than tortas are great, one of the best original Mexican food places in Tempe that contain real Mexican foods!"}
{"text":"If you've ever been an inebriated bachelor and piled whatever you found in your fridge in between two slices of bread or into a tortilla,  or perhaps a struggling mother who feeds her family a hearty mash-up of Whatever once a week on Leftover Night,  then you'll appreciate \"The King of the Sandwiches\".  Don't be afraid of rubbing elbows with your fellow patrons, or of a little grease running down from your overstuffed-torta-compressing hand all the way to that elbow.  Try somethign that sounds loco -- it won't be that hard.  A couple of the choices contain basically everything you could think of to put on a sandwich, and then some.  Actually, you could get a single sandwich that contains the innards of about a half dozen sandwiches all at once.  Epiphany~  LRDLT's Del Rey and Las Reynas sandwiches are essentially the Turduken of torta shop tortas.

{"text":"I went here looking for the amazing sandwich that I keep hearing about and saw on TV. La torta del Ray was just amazing and filled me up. It's a decent looking restaurant and contains friendly customer service. Going to have to comeback for that sandwich."}
{"text":"Stoped in for my favorite home made shrimp ceviche tostadas. I love that there is a mini and a regular size. I go for the mini so I can eat more and think I am eating less. My other favorite is the Hawaiian Burger with grilled pineapple and ham in addition to all the other layers of the sandwich. I don't even have the amount of time to write about the fantastic drinks made from fresh fruit and vegetables...it's a carnival of drinks!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Yuma, so after moving here, I REALLY missed Mexican food. Found this place, and have gone back whenever I can! The sandwiches are large (one can definitely last me two meals), and cost around $11. The service has always been good, and I've definitely never left unsatisfied. I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my dad for lunch a few days ago and it was seriously tasty. We split the torta nortena with chicken and the chicken ranchera torta and both were delicious. My only complaint was the nortena's bottom half of the bread was soaked through so I had to eat it with a knife and fork, but the flavor was spicy and delicious. The ranchera was even better, it had a lot of flavor for being a more simple sandwich. I would definitely come back here again...."}
{"text":"We pulled into Los Reyes just before noon after an all nighter, flight and roaming around the less than desirable neighborhoods of Phoenix; all because we were riding the Man v. Food bandwagon.   Not sure about the other location, but this had quite the dive-y feel to it that I love. Menu was exclusively in Spanish which wasn't too hard to decipher, but made me happy we had our amiga with us.   I had a feeling this place was going to be good, but became ever more excited when our Mexican friend started getting excited at the authenticity of the menu compared to the food she enjoys when in Mexico.   Everything was fresh and everybody was VERY happy with their meal. I somehow finished off a giant torta despite being full half way through because the flavor was so amazing.   No alcohol and while a beer would have been great, it definitely shouldn't keep you from going for a nice binge."}
{"text":"I love this place. I had the Norteño steak torta, So delicious!. I been here 3 times now, so many options to choose from. The only time I would get  tired of it probably would be once I go through the whole Menu ;). Everyone should give it a try."}
{"text":"Note to self: when going to new Mexican Food Restaurant during the World Cup and Mexico is playing...take time to read the menu. First time here. Menu is massive.   Ordered the Pambazo Torta. Thought it had roast beef. Presented with this huge sandwich. After eating half of the tasty meal...did not recall seeing the roast beef. Started to disect the second half and saw what I thought was refried beans. Strange... why would one put refried beans on a torta. You do see refried beans in a burro. Hey maybe the roast beef is mixed in with refried beans.  Server asked how I liked the torta. Said it was great what was in it. She said chorizo and potatoe. There are  no refried beans or roast beef in it. That made things pretty clear.  Probably try something else on next trip. Will be sure to do my research ahead of time. Authentic and tasty. Actually broke a sweat which means good heat."}
{"text":"Don't waste you time, money, nor calories. Even the chips and sala were bland. Got the ceviche....terrible. 2 tortas and they were terrible. Worse tasting restaurant ever."}
{"text":"So I was like a lemming trying this after Man vs Food when recently visiting Phoenix.  But......  the kid is right.... everything on the Del Rey torta works together.  And it is HUGE.  And it's great too.  Wonderfully constructed, just enough of everything and not too much of anything.  I also had the watermelon juice (interesting, huh)?  One strange thing.... first Mexican restaurant I've ever been in that didn't have chips and salsa.  Only real downside is that the service is a bit slow.  But they're slammed and deservedly so."}
{"text":"OMG!  This place from the outside makes you wonder what the food is going to be like but once inside, you're in for a treat!  The food was some of the best Mexican I've ever had!  Definitely recommend!  Don't judge from the outside because the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Me and my buddy went there today for the first time. Great staff, the food was good. Now down side they don't have a liquor license, but the waiter did say you can bring your own beer in! I will come back here, but with a six pack before walking in lol"}
{"text":"The Sunday uniforms are so nice. Added a formal feel to my already 5 star meal. The tortas are so big and filling. The waitresses are prompt and helpful. I even ordered my sandwich without peppers. No problem."}
{"text":"We went there cuz was recommended on one of the food shows.  Aside from alot of food, I was really not impressed.  Was just so much and flavor got all mixed together.  Very good service.  But will also cause a heart attack if go too often.    And we also got a mango drink.  Was in this hug glass.  But too sweet for my taste bud."}
{"text":"Still le merd.    Took 3 newbies today and they were blown away.  Superb lunch.  Ranchera Especial is a favorite of mine. The Norteno de pollo or res is killer. Anything named Alambre.  Yum"}
{"text":"This restaurant is not 4 dollar signs...it's more like 1 dollar sign..great food and amazing service especially if you're looking for a quick place to eat"}
{"text":"This is definitely an authentic hole-in-the-wall place. The food was pretty good (we had tortas - they were good, but nothing to rave about), but the service was rushed and seemed a bit annoyed."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place in the paper and from the chef/owner of Barrio Cafe as a savory, cheap eat, I finally gave it a try earlier this year and have been wanting to go back! I had half a regular torta with the tender slices of  beef (mmm...little slices of heaven), avocado,  that pork, all on a white roll. And there's no way I could finish a whole torta. So, from a budget standpoint, it's even more worth the money. Also tried one of their huge huarache, corn tortilla that was snowed on by queso fresco. Anyone who goes must have one of their fresh fruit juices. They have a wonderful variety and it's a nice kick with meaty, not-sweet menu. It's definitely one of those places where there are more natives than gringos, which is a good sign."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Great jugos frescas. Please understand when you come here this is not Garcias Americanized food. This is closer to authentic Mexico City food.  Give it a try, and the part of town ain't that sketchy."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Beef nachos to start. Chicken enchiladas for the husband.  Grilled shrimp fajita burrito for me."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was awesome!  The Torta Del Rey was the bomb!  It's not a fancy place, but it was clean with attentive service. The chipotle sauce was perfect. I'm a big guy and this meal was plenty filling."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The food is quite different then the Mexican food I grew up on in South Phoenix. This place as become my all tie favorite Mexican restaurant. Food is great, the staff is awesome, nice and very friendly (they all seem to really enjoy their jobs) and the building itself is very clean. They now have a lifetime customer!"}
{"text":"So far, food and service have been good. Their quesadillas estilo rey are so freaking good. Can't wait to try another item next time."}
{"text":"Came in to get take-out, and was treated like a valued customer. We still got chips and salsa and glasses of water while we were waiting -- and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"I would've given this place 4 stars if the wait to get a table and the wait to finally get drinks and our food had not been so ridiculously LONG.  It wasn't the restaurant's fault we had to wait 45 minutes for our table, but it is their fault that it took more than 30 minutes to get our drinks after we placed our order.  And they didn't even bring us waters in the mean time!  Even though this place is famous for its tortas, the tortas actually didn't look that appetizing.  My friends who ordered them described them as \"Mexican burgers.\"  I'm not really into that, so I ordered the carne asada tacos.  They were tasty, and I actually finished all 3.  The sides of raw radishes and cucumbers were a little strange, but it wasn't bad.  If I were to go again (which I doubt because the wait was so long and there are plenty of other - better - Mexican restaurants in town) I would order the chicken quesadillas.  I tried a bite of one and it was really good.  On top of that it was pretty smoky inside the restaurant due to poor ventilation in the kitchen.  I hate leaving a restaurant and having my hair and clothes smell like smoke/food!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, grabbed lunch with a coworker. Found this nice little hole In the wall restraint. We were greeted with a smile, and promptly sat. The food was delicious.. Would definitely recommend the tacos, I got the carne asada ones"}
{"text":"Great torta nortena. My gf told me about the place, as she saw it on man v food as well.  I was in that area and decided to stop.  The nortena has steak, chipotle mayo, cheese, avocado, grilled onion and don't know what else.  The bread was really good. Nice and soft, perfectly toasted. I love sandwiches, but not the panera type places.  My dream sandwich is a Cuban sandwich in a puerto rican bakery.  But, this torta sure gives that a run for its money.  I'll be frequenting this place. Probably the best, most authentic Mexican place I've been here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food. Big portions and small prices. Good service. A must of you have not tried. The Torta Del Reyes is the MOTHER SANDWICH and only $7. Its over two pounds of goodness."}
{"text":"I cannot lie, I was exited to come here and I had high expectations. I seen this place on Man Vs Food and have been wanting that Torta ever since. I must say, I'm not impressed. I'm from Los Angeles Ca., the land where some of the best and most authentic food come from. So I always have higher expectations when it comes to Mexican food. This  was def not mi amor. I would say this isn't MexiCAN food but more like MexiCANT. No bueno"}
{"text":"Amazing hole-in-the-wall restaurant with a huge menu.  Everything looks tasty, but we highly recommend their Molletes as an appetizer.  It comes with a great hot sauce (Red or green, with red being spicier.) that makes a great topping for the Tortas too.  The servings are huge and reasonably priced.  A couple could easily split an appetizer and torta.  I wanted to try the 10th anniversary Carlos V food challenge (Eat the thing in 15minutes and it's free), but they weren't offering the challenge anymore.  At $25 for the Torta Carlos V, I decided to stick with the very popular Torta Del Sol and was very pleased with my meal.  I left absolutely stuffed.  If you're looking for a smaller torta, we recommend the Torta Mexicana.  it is similar to a fresh Philly Cheese Steak with guacamole.  They don't serve alcohol.  However, the business is located on an extremely busy street with lanes that close from 4-6pm and I wouldn't order a drink, even if they offered them."}
{"text":"This is tthhoouurrgghhllyy gooood.  As I walked in I went through my checklist of pre-meal approval.  x Tasty Aroma x Other People  x People of the restaurant's nationality  x Satisfied Diners And a bonus of being able to see the chefs cooking.   The wait staff was friendly, patient, fast, amd attentive. I split the Torta Del Rey with my Father, my mother got the Sope, and my brother ordered a chicken Quesedilla. Let it also be known that there is an exotic, extensive, and large drink selection including a fantastic fruit selection.   As my meal came 10-15 minutes later I was not disappointed. The torta was huge and split in half, perfect to share. Instead of listing what was on the torta, it would probably be easier to list what was nt in the torta. It tasted like I was eating a farm. I will do my best to list out what was on this monster. Ham, Sausage Omelet, I think chicken, tomato, avocado, onion, and more! As a Jew, I have had a lot of great sandwiches, and this is right there at the top. By the time I was finishing I had to use my fork, for it was falling apart (always a good thing). My mother's Sope was delicious. As was my brother's quesidilla.   Now their drinks were absolutely amazing. I got the watermelon agua de frescas and I am still dumbfounded on how they made this. It looked like they took a hunk of watermelon, put it in a glass, and served it. But the description says there is also water and sugar. It was big, flavorful, and refreshing. I think that the drink is what a desert oasis must be like.   I will highly highly recommend coming here. I highly highly recommend getting the torta del rey. I highly highly recommend getting the watermelon drink. This was one of the best meals I have ever had. I recommend before you die and for your soul to come have a meal here. This was thoroughly good."}
{"text":"Amazing and authentic Mexican food! Everything from the way they prepare their fruit to the salsa on their enchiladas is made to perfection ! The portions are huge and the prices are correctly marked! There is no going wrong with this place if you are craving Mexican food! Great service and comfortable spot with great Mexican music !"}
{"text":"Went to AZ and tried out this place because of the Man Vs Food show. We all ordered the Del Ray Torta and they were just mounds of flavorless meats. One of friends even got sick after eating there. I would not go there again."}
{"text":"The staff is so welcoming. The food is authentic and generous portions. Would come again and again. We had Alicia as our server and she was a doll!!"}
{"text":"I've had this place on my wish list for quite a long time and today it was fulfilled! Holy Moley!!! It was AMAZING! Huge menu... Had to get a tortas. I had the Hawaiian Torta- it was savory, cheesy, spicy & sweet, and just plain delicious!! My friend had the Del Rey- it was ENORMOUS! These Tortas are like a party of flavor in each bite. Service was great, too. Highly recommended- 2 thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"They had vegan and vegetarian tacos, which was surprising for such a local, authentic-ish Mexican spot. I was still hungry when I left, but I wasn't upset because it was expected to be small tacos. Mushrooms on the vegan and vegetarian tacos. Good stuff and some fruity drinks."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Great prices for both unique and authentic Mexican food. It's not the typical northern Mexican cuisine we're accustomed to in Arizona, but rather Mexico City-style. The staff is very friendly.  If you don't know what torta is. it's the Mexican word for sandwich (though in the rest of Latin America it means cake). And these guys really are \"The Kings of the Torta.\" My favorite one is the Hawaiian torta.   The aguas naturales are amazing fruit drinks. Watermelon is my favorite.  And for desert the fruit with nuts and honey is a great finish to this meal."}
{"text":"I loved the food at Los Reyes de la Torta. The service was no good, but the food more than made up for it.  I had Alambre de res which was very good. My only complaint was the small portion of rice and the beans- I was not sure what was going on with the beans. My husband had la torta de rey which he enjoyed. The torta is definitely something to share with another person.   Although the food is not better than the Mexican food I or my mom make, this is definitely the place to go for me when I don't feel like cooking my own Mexican dinner.  P.S. Try the Fresas  con Crema sold in the refrigerator behind the front counter. They are the best I have had!"}
{"text":"Went here with my job and also because it was on Man versus Food.  The food was good however I ate the carne asada torta and had a cantalope drink to wash it all down.  They have some sandwiches that are just plain disgusting looking but beauty is in the eye and mouth of the beholder.  My co-wroker had a sandwish with ham, ground beef, hot dogs, another type of meat, cheese.... you get the picture.  Not my cup o tea but apparently something he wanted."}
{"text":"Los Reyes has seemingly gained its reputation for good reason. I had the King Steak tacos and they were awesome and their rice may be the very best I've had in the valley. I've still only had one opportunity eat here but I can't wait to get back and put the tortas to the test!"}
{"text":"Just picked up a to go order. Fast and delicious. I had the green chile enchiladas, my kids had the chicken with rice and beans and the steak rice and beans kids plate. We all gobbled it up. So good. We will be back."}
{"text":"we went here because it was featured in the travel channel. i was not disappointed. we ordered the torta with ceviche and the cactus taco. the food was delicious and the service was great. they also serve yummy fruit smoothies. all in all, this place is a must to visit."}
{"text":"I ordered a Torta Mexicana and three asada tacos to go with the anticipation it would the best kept secret. I have to say the Asada had no flavor. The bread was good with the torta all the ingredients are as fresh as your gonna get. The food smelt better than it tasted. It wasn't bad , but I don't think I would come back for more. I really don't get all the hype."}
{"text":"Great customer service. I love their chips and salsa. I always come here for their tortas as their portions are good and they always come out tasting amazing. I take everyone here and they always enjoy the food. Last time, I got the enchiladas and it was decent. Their frescas are really good. I'd also recommend their tortas as a good place to start. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Agua Frescas...the term always eluded me. I knew it was some sort of Mexican drink, but I never really took the time to give it a shot, I guess my disdain for Horchata scared me off from other ethnic drinks, well...Los Reyes de la Torta made me regret my shortsightedness. After trying the Agua Frescas here, I went home and all but prayed for forgiveness from the Agua Fresca God for doubting him...this is one seriously good drink...at least at Los Reyes de la Torta it is.   This place was our back up plan for dinner last Saturday...and quickly became our first choice because our other front runner (Sonora Mesquite Grill) seemed to be inexplicably closed on Saturday evening. This ended up being a blessing though, because I can't imagine having a better Mexican meal than we did at Los Reyes de la Torta.   Right when you walk in, you know this place means business. Open kitchen, great smelling food being cooked up, 'best of' signs posted everywhere, and a packed house with people smiling and enjoying themselves wherever you look.   Upon first opening the menu, we noticed the prices...dirt cheap. Because of this we decided to get three menu items to try, along with a couple of agua frescas. Here's a breakdown of what we tried:   -Pineapple Agua Fresca - Delicious...frothy and natural tasting with each sip filled with a mouth full of mini pineapple bits.   -Lime Agua Fresca - Like a fresh squeezed lime...unbelievable refreshing.   -Asada Quesadilla - We both liked this the most out of anything we got. Fresh and tasty cheese, awesome tortilla, great tasting carne asada, and a mixture tomatoes/beans/cilantro/avacodo...melt in your mouth good.   -Cubana Torta - We are big torta fans, but had to try one here. It was good, but we weren't blown away...again, we aren't big torta fans...so take this with a grain of salt.   -Carne Asada Tacos - Okay, I know we already got a carne asada quesadilla...but we really like carne asada...so we just had to do it. The tacos were pretty good, but I wouldn't say they were spectacular. Everything in the taco tasted great but the mini tortillas they use for the tacos wasn't quite as tasty as the flour tortilla they used for the quesadilla.   ...we left stuffed and satisfied with our meal. The only possible negative thing about this place is that they don't serve chips and salsa, which is a shame. The hot sauce they bring out to your table to go with your meal would go great with some warm crunchy chips.   All in all...this place is excellent. Authentic quality Mexican food for dirt cheap, anyone in the area should definitely check it out. I can't wait to go back and try more stuff. This is a possible 5 star place, just need to go a few more times before it gets 'bumped up'.   4.25/5."}
{"text":"I loved this place! To start, the service was amazing. Our server Tony had great customer service. He greeted us right away. He also recommended a drink that I was interested in trying. They have a juicer and make them all from scratch. Both drinks we had were great. My order had modifications and he repeated everything back to me to assure it was correct. He checked on us in a timely manner, and even shook our hands to say goodbye.   The food was also amazing. It was the most authentic Mexican food I've had since moving to Arizona. I had the enchiladas, and they were almost as good as my grandmothers. Unfortunately, I was too full for dessert, but I would definitely go again! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place after seeing this restaurant on Man v. Food. I'm going to get down to the point. This place was totally not worth it. It took about an hour before we were able to order our food after being seated, My friend ordered a margarita and they failed to tell us that they did not have their liquor license yet and it was going to be a virgin margarita. I ordered their asada burrito with red sauce on top and it was horrible. There was barely any meat but a lot of fat and chewy pieces inside. I can honestly say that I've had a better asada burrito at Filiberto's. Our waiter was young but nice. I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Easily the best sandwiches I have ever had. The USA sandwich was great, it contained a mixture of flavors that went great together."}
{"text":"Since moving to Phoenix about 7 months ago, we were having a hard time finding any great mexican food....until now! This place is very good, great prices and very friendly staff. Highly recommended!! We have been here a couple of times since finding it 2 months ago...have loved everything so far."}
{"text":"Your juices and bombas are divine and the service is superb. The torta was a bit spicy for my taste, but I bet there are people out there who absolutely love the heat. I'll go for something a bit milder next time. I had no idea this little gem was hidden down here in Tempe. Must repeat visit."}
{"text":"One of the best Tortas I've ever had it was delicious. I'd recommend this place to everyone it's so good!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the one on 9th st so this is my first time at this location. It's bigger, more updated. We came when it was not so busy, the food was good as always, service was just eh... She never came back to ask if we needed anything until she brought us our bill... Some more napkins would've been great... I'd still come back cause I enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Had the King Carlos, or more like had 3/4 of half of it (see picture). It was filled with about 206 kinds of protein along with a thin slice of avocado, tomato and lettuce to help balance it out... Sort of. The torta bread is really good but the flavor of sandwich itself is really muddled with so many meats. Still pretty good though."}
{"text":"the service here is amazing and the palmer omg i just cant get enough of that its soooo creamy and delish! the food is amazing and the plates are just huge! good pricing too this place was on man vs food great show"}
{"text":"I have kept coming here over and over and I always get something delicious. My husband and my three kids love it. I have told friends to come here and they have never been disappointed. The cabeza, and carne asada tacos are my favorites. however almost any torta is good too. My kids love the sincronizada and the carne asada platters too. I always order the toreado chiles and the onions as a side with whatever I order because they are so good. I have tried sopes, huaraches,tostadas,tacos and tortas and I have never been disappointed. Don't forget to ask for the picante salsa they make but only give you if you ask. Is spicy but very good!. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I loved the food here. The ambiance not so much- the TVs were crazy loud and the interior was very similar to Rodibertos. However, they had ice cold bottled \" Mexican\"  Coke, and the BEST street tacos I have ever had. Delicious! Super fresh salsa, plentiful lime wedges, And so much steak it was a tough job to power it all down. I mean, I totally did- but it was a bit of a challenge. The rice was only OK, and the beans were so-so. But the tacos were crazy good. They were also quite speedy which is always good when you are on lunch break."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with a business client waited a long time to be seated - made a mistake on the order - drinks came 1/2 way through lunch - food was good but not exceptional - ordered a recommended favorite - above average but that's it"}
{"text":"Have been here plenty of times over the past few years, not sure why I haven't written a review. We always get the same tortas. My husband get the Del Rey and I get the Nortena de Res... never had a bad experience!! The owner is always there making sure all customers are happy. They have yummy drinks and awesome chips & salsa. We live about 30 minutes but still make the trip. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the absolute-best restaurants in Arizona! Get the big Torta, or quesadilla, or fruit plate, or any of their amazing n/a drinks. Sneak in (they don't care) some alcohol if you want to spike their non-alco versions. The drinks are worth the trip alone. Pina Colada is out of control.   Get extra Chipotle sauce for whatever you order!"}
{"text":"Adventure is the spice of life. So are peppers so hot they burn you twice. Such is the lesson learned at Los Reyes de la Torta, located in an otherwise unremarkable part of West Indian School, where nary a white boy doth travel. However, I found myself in the neighborhood when my employer asked me to take my car on our courier route to retrieve bank transactions for customers who otherwise wouldn't be able to make it into a branch. I love my job. I love my job. I love my job...  But I digress.  This location has a menu nearly identical to the Seventh Street location, except it's almost exclusively in Spanish. It's times like this I wish I was bilingual. However, the carne asade quesadilla I ordered was good with tender strips of beef; the chips were okay and the salsa was delightfully spicy and fresh. My server was exceptionally polite and tried to communicate with me, despite the language barrier.  It's hard to say if I'd make this a destination or not. Chances are, since I rarely travel to this area I'd only go back if worked called me out to this area."}
{"text":"Ordered the Del Rey.  While it was good, I wish I would have spent a little more time studying the menu because I would have ordered something different.  But no would'a, should'a, could'as.  So what I ordered was ok, maybe even a little more than ok.  A few observations...  - A really biiiiggggg sandwich that comes out of the kitchen reeeeaaaallllllyyyy hot.  Almost too big and too hot to eat. - The hot dogs (or whatever they were) seemed to be of sketchy provenance.  I pulled them off the sandwich. - The avocado/guacamole on the sandwich was very good. - The bread/roll doesn't hold up to the size and composition of the sandwich...I ended up eating with a knife and fork.  Not complaining...just commenting."}
{"text":"We turned into the parking lot a little sooner than we should have and as such we drove by a Taco Bell.  As we did so I commented that if all else fails we could go to Taco Bell.  As we drove through the lot we finally saw the place, parked and entered.  We were immediately seated and soon the chips and salsa arrived.  In short YUCK!!  Chips were stale and the salsa wasn't appreciably better.  Ordered a diet coke and tea.  In short YUCK!!  Tea went back in favor of another diet coke.  Next we ordered...2 tortas...Ranchera de pollo o res (with steak) and a Carne Asada.  As I figured out later I got the wrong sandwich (mine should have had chips but didn't) but at the end both sandwiches were the same albeit what should have been mine had cucumbers, radishes, etc vice chips.  So a couple of observations...every other Carne Asada torta I've ever had came with chopped meat vice strips (quite wide strips).  Moreover, it this is how they do it then other the sides, and as mentioned already, there was NO FRIGGIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SANDWICHES...WTF!!!!!!  As for the sandwiches themselves...YUCK!!!  There are far too many places to get a far superior torta in the Valley.  In short, I should have gone to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I apologize for not writing this one soon after I ate there. We had read the reviews and everyone seemed to really like the food. This place is not fancy by any means. Very plain but the food.... The offerings on the menu was different from any mexican food place I have been to. Many offerings I have never seen before. My suggestion is go there and experience the food. I have eaten mexican food all over the west from Texas to California and all states between. This was  the best I have had. I loved the menu selections. Not just burritos, tacos, tostadas or a combination of these three. A completely new offerings of items and everything looked good. First go to their website then go. It was hard for me to rate this restaurant. The food was positively a 5. The service was a 4. Not bad service, just not as good as it gets. The store was a 4. Nothing bad just not a 5. So I gave the place a 4. If I could give a 4.5.   Go there. Eat! Enjoy. I loved the new food choices. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Being that we were the only gringos in the joint was a good sign for me - this is where mexicans go for mexican food! Prices were reasonable, service was immediate and continuous (refills on water, chips, salsa,etc.) our server was very sweet, even took a photo for our group. The Hot salsa was muy picante - the house salsa was delicious and I wish I could get it at the store. The atmosphere was a bit noisy-sportsbar-ish, but I came for the food and was very pleased. We had Chicken Enchiladas, Tacos Camarones, and Tongue Tacos (no kidding...) and it was all very authentic and tasty. I will likely return if I'm in the Tempe area again with hungry friends."}
{"text":"Los Reyes De La Torta  This locally owned family restaurant serves up very authentic mexican food.  They are famous for their tortas and in particular the \"Del Rey\" which consists of - Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, sausage, chorizo and eggs with tomato, onions, jalapeño and avocado. This beast is about 8 inches tall and can barely bite into it. All the different items blend well with each other for $8.99  The Del Rey was featured in Man vs Food and is their staple but other items are very good also.  King Carlos V is the double version of the Del Rey and is brought out on a pallet for $19.99.  The tacos and burritos are also tasty and you will not leave feeling hungry.   We also have had the Mexican drinks aqua fresca which comes in a variety of flavors and which you can't go wrong.  But if you go here the tortas are what you come here for."}
{"text":"Their sister restaurant was on man vs food and is in a little better location but the food is just as good as the original. If you get the del Rey Torta they will serve it with French fries rather than chips at the original location. May want to split the del Rey Torta with someone"}
{"text":"I tried my first torta years ago at a Baja Fresh and fell in love with Mexican sandwiches.  Surprisingly enough, Baja Fresh had extremely good tortas and most of the other places I went to couldn't compare.  Man Versus Food introduced me first to the original location in Phoenix and I couldn't get enough of the place.  Then my prayers were answered last year when a location opened up near home in Tempe.  Hallelujah and pass the chips and salsa.  The menu is slightly overwhelming, but the food, from the salads to the beans to the wide selection of tortas is of very good quality.  Yes, I love this particular LRDLT because it's close to home, but more importantly it's an actual restaurant that provides chips and spicy salsa (unlike the Phoenix location) when you first sit down.  Service is friendly and it's fast.  I think I may have gotten my Del Rey Torta before I ordered it.  That's fast service!  Pork, hot dogs, egg, ham and cheese and I don't know what else all in a sandwich?  Yup, that's the magnificently tasty Del Rey.    I highly recommend this place.  If you're a fan of quality Mexican food at extremely reasonable prices and you're not sure if you want some seafood, a salad or a torta, LRDLT can satisfy a variety of cravings.  **Tip 1**  This place serves booze!!!  I love the aguas frescas at the Phoenix location, but without booze, I was left missing that extra something.  I need miss out no longer  **Tip 2**  Do you like grilled veggies like it do?  Order the side of grilled sliced onions and jalapenos and the cucumber slices and radishes.  Oh the humanity!!!  **Tip 3**  Check your mailbox!!!!  I have received several mailers with 20% discounts on your entire LRDLT check!"}
{"text":"Anyone who wants to go here....sign me up as your arm candy.  This place was fantastic for what it is.   You can call it Mexican but its not your typical corporate-menu Mexican fare.  The menu is full of ceviches, tortas, and large aguas frescas served in ridiculously large margarita glasses.    I rocked the \"Hawaiian\", my date rocked the \"Mexican.\"   We had a little ceviche tostada on the side, washed it all down with a pina colada and found ourselves in heaven.    They will be seeing this guy again."}
{"text":"So, Man Vs. Food came and now it get's crowded. That's what I hear. We went at 11:00 a.m. on Sunday and walked right in, but by 12:00 it was packed. Husband HAD to try the Del Rey Torta (eaten by Adam on the show) and darn, the thing is huge. I had another, which was beef, jalapeno, grilled onions, avocado, chipotle. YUMMY. Wish they had fries instead of chips with sandwiches. Everyone within earshot said this was very authentic mexican food. The platters coming out were massive. The agua frescas were delicious (we had mango and pina). Now, if only I could have had a tecate, life would have been perfect. We had two tortas and two agua frescas for $22. Quite a deal. Prices seemed great, and I would love to try anything else on the menu, which is quite large. We will be back!"}
