{"text":"If I were emerging from the wilderness cold, wet and starving, I would be grateful indeed to come across the Uptown Diner. In a world where I had a choice, however, I would exercise it and dine elsewhere. The single server was simply overwhelmed, and she shouted across the room to her customers, which made for a grating experience. Because she was alone, the service was excruciatingly slow. When my food came, it was pedestrian--an Oscar Meyer quality club sandwich and frankly nasty fries. I discarded half my meal."}
{"text":"We have been here several times. The food has consistently been good. I really enjoy the country fried steak, the hash browns and the cheesy hash brown casserole. Coffee is always good, hot and plentiful. I've read a few reviews of people waiting a long time for their meals but we've never had this problem. Sausage gravy with biscuits is another real treat. My son had a burger--not a frozen prefab patty. Fresh cut fries were tasty too. Only thing I would suggest is having coffee creamer and sugar available without having to ask, same for jelly and butter. I'm sure this is a hiccup with being new and having new servers and would think this won't be an issue going forward. We enjoy supporting local family run establishments and they make it easier by serving good food!"}
{"text":"The food is good diner food.  I had one lunch and two breakfast items.  The coffee is very good.  The only problems I can see could be easily corrected.  The place was not crowded but our breakfast was a bit slow coming to the table and brought out in parts.  Mine and my spouses in three parts.  My spouse got  her waffle, no syrup.  She requested syrup and the waitress said she would bring it with the rest of her food. Then her eggs, hash browns and bacon arrived.  Finally the sausage made it.  The biggest problem is the service.   The first time I was there we had a great waitress.  She did her job and kept our drinks full.  But every other time the service was very poor.  I know a little about food service so let me make a recommendation on waitress training.  Greet customer, hand out menu and take drink order. Bring drinks and take food order.  Serve food and ask is there anything else I can get you.  If so get it now.  Come back in an appropriate amount of time and ask how everything is.  Check back again and again.  Ask if there is anything else I could get you.  If not set check facing down on table.  Simple plan and should increase tips.  I hope this place makes it because service is a huge part of success.  Good luck."}
{"text":"We've been to the Uptown Diner several times and it has been consistently good. But, today I tried the country fried steak breakfast and it was amazing, hands down the best I've ever eaten. 

The tender steak was fried to a golden crisp, with the perfect amount of flavorful crunch. 

The sausage gravy had large chunks of delicious sausage, tasted fresh and was obviously not from a can, with just the right flavor of black pepper. 

It was so good that I asked to speak to the cook to compliment him and I downloaded the Yelp app specifically to write this review.

Oh, and the eggs, hash browns and toast were good too..."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and wanted to take the in laws out for brunch.The food here was delicious! Good old home style cooking. The biscuits and gravy were to die for, so full of thick chunks of sausage and the biscuits were huge! The cheesy hash browns were amazing. And the coffee was also very fresh and actually came in a full sized mug, not a little mini one at other restaurants.  The price was extremely reasonable for all of the food we got. My in-laws loved it and I loved it too! Will definitely be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"Arrived about 11AM on a Friday, found out they did not have my first choice for breakfast, found out they did not have my second choice either, the home fries that came with the omelet appeared and tasted like they were cooked for the third time, dark and greasy. The coffee was not that great either. The tab was $25.00 for two people for two omelets. I do not plan on returning !"}
{"text":"Home made onion rings make it worth the trip. Burgers were fresh and juicy, loved the hand cut fries, and that they come out unsalted.  Our large coffee cups were kept full with fresh coffee.  Staff is friendly.  Have stopped in twice, and the owner has stopped twice to chat.  Ordered the BLT the second time, great sandwich with lots of bacon.  Nice to have a local option to choose from on Rt.8."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. Everything I want In a breakfast (Cheesy potatoes were to die for). 
The service was a bit slow, however, the place was close to full and two girls were working their butts off to get everyone seated, served and cashed out so props to them. 
It's definitely worth a try!
Recommend."}
{"text":"Finally another restaurant on Route 8! I was there on Saturday, new second day after their grand opening. The new diner is cute and quaint. I wish it was decorated a bit more but maybe they are going to add some stuff as they go. The atmosphere is half old time diner and half new classy restaurant with chandeliers and cloth napkins. The service was friendly and menu had some interesting ingredients. I went for breakfast and had a delicious veggie omelette with a biscuit and the cheesy hash brown casserole. Everything was really tasty except here was a hair in my hash browns. The waitress was very polite and brought me new food and took my food off my bill. Very accommodating! Overall it's a good place and I would go back to try something different. They are just starting out and I'm sure will improve on some of there weaknesses!"}
{"text":"We had wanted to try Uptown for some time, but the poor reviews kept us away. 

I read the recent good reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. 

We were pleasantly surprised. We arrived around 9 AM on a Sunday, were seated promptly and our drink orders taken. Our food also came out pretty quickly. I ordered the corned beef, eggs and cheesy hash browns and my boyfriend had a brisket omelette and cheesy hash browns. Everything was delicious and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had high hopes but left disappointed. They need to work on some things. I ordered pancakes & they laid in my stomach like a brick. Orange juice was warm?!? Sent it back for another beverage. My husband ordered an omelette which he said was good. Would hate to see this place go under. Hoping they can work out the \"bugs\"! They just don't seem to be organized. The place is new so it may take some time get it together. If they don't, I can't see this place staying in business."}
{"text":"This was hands down the worst resturant experience of my life the waitress was awful she was very rude before I say down I wanted to leave you could hear everyone complaining about how bad there good was after I waited an hour I finally got my food and it was cold and it tastes horrible and she forgot my toast I will never go back there and I recommend nobody else does either"}
{"text":"I love this place.  We've come many times and plan on coming back many more times.  Food's great and you get a lot of it."}
{"text":"Crab cake sandwich today was great. Always pleased with the diner and the owners really care."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. 

We sat in the restaurant for one full hour waiting for our food that never came. Our waitress kept coming over to tell us that she was \"checking on our food,\" but never came back with it. What we believe to be the manager, was walking around the restaurant socializing with other customers and playing with her hair, not a care in the world. When we told her that we were leaving because we hadn't received our food, she said \"okay!\" This business will not last very long. I can't speak about the food, but the service was terrible. 

And the bathroom... I would rather go outdoors. 

A truly pathetic excuse for a business."}
{"text":"I really really really want to give this place a higher rating, but they need to do a complete over haul of their customer service. This is close to work, and another option for lunch that I want to go to more, but I just can't do it.

The food is always excellent, there is no denying that! But the staff and wait time is just unacceptable. There is no reason for a lunch to take an hour and half! I have given them 3 chances and have been let down every single time. The waitress are slow, it takes 15 minutes to get a drink order in, and then forever to get your food. No apologies, no reason why, nothing but excruciating waiting and waiting. I understand that everything is made fresh, but I have been to way more fancy resturants that make everything fresh, and it does not take nearly this long. This is a diner, and one of the appeals of a diner is a fast, good meal!

I hope in time they work out these issues and figure out how to streamline what they are doing. Staff needs to be trained on customer service, and how to serve and be attentive in a timely manner. Until then, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS DINER!!! The food is delicious the service and always friendly and fast it's good to see smiling faces and always happy people. I would recommend this diner to everyone. MUST TRY IT!!!"}
{"text":"Stick to breakfast I've had good experiences here breakfast is always very good high-quality freshly made. Yesterday had a chef salad. The salad had minimal meat and cheese. After serving I was told that they were out of Turkey and was given a side plate of some steakums. Clearly this should have been discussed with me before ordering"}
{"text":"There are two listings on Yelp for this diner, so this review is posted under both.

Oh, where to begin. We waited 55 minutes for our food. Then we didn't get all of our food. We would have asked for the missing items, but we didn't have another hour to kill. There was a very cold breeze from the window. Someone else was waiting 20 minutes, complained, and got his food before we did. And then, after all that, the food was not good.

The crab cakes on the eggs benedict were decent, but both potato sides tasted weird, the eggs in the omelet were heavy (not fluffy), and there was a weird sausage in it (not breakfast sausage flavor). The poached eggs on the eggs benedict were undercooked and slimy. I never saw more than two plates coming out of the kitchen at a time, and usually five or more minutes apart. Breakfast food should never take an hour.

The waitress never came by our table to apologize or explain why the wait was so long. There were plenty of empty seats - they were not busy.

*EDIT - I forgot to mention two things: 1 -  They didn't have enough menus. The menus are simply printed out on paper and stapled together. There is no excuse for making two people share a menu when you can print out more. 2 - The flowers at our table were dead and near rotting. Someone could have easily removed them before they began to smell."}
{"text":"I was a bit leary about trying this after reading the reviews but I am glad I tried it out for myself. I found the restaurant to be full for  a Saturday morning. The waitress was very warm and attentive.  Super pleased to have a mug of great coffee rather then a standard cup like at other restaurants. Eggs cornbeef hash and homefries were awesome. Don't pass up the cheesy hashbrowns. They are a must have. 

If I were to guess the previous poor experiences can be attributed to being brand new and working out the kinks.  You shouldn't expect everything to be perfect during the first couple of months especially when at s non chain restaurant.  I for one am pleased to have an option rather then Eat and park and Kings.  Give them another try.  I'm looking forward to trying their lunch menu soon.

{"text":"Good food, cheesy hash brown potatoes are to die for.  Would recommend.  I'm glad I stopped here with my family.  Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here, basically I was disappointed. It just is not a healthy place to eat. There was no fruit option, only fried things like potatoes. They don't take charge cards and I at least just don't carry much cash now days. They need to take a stroll by one of their competitors like Panera. Look at their menu what they offer. More healthy choices please."}
{"text":"A step above your typical diner and a good find for those of us on the route 8 corridor  (Hampton, Allison park, richland). I think this was a Chinese restaurant but they've transformed it with some gray paint, a reclaimed wood feature wall, and a counter -- keeping the dark green vinyl booths that make for comfy seating. The menu was good with lots of standard diner fare. I had an omelette, with see delicious cheese potatoes... it was all good. My boyfriend had their big breakfast sandwich and loved it. Service could have been a little better for refills and getting our check but all in all fine. For a great Sunday brunch I'd still choose Breakneck Tavern or Scratch, but for an easy, yummy and convenient diner-type brunch or lunch, this was great."}
{"text":"Great food,Great prices!! Even have a little bar area if you are alone!! Glad as stated in another review that I Didn't take the poor ratings and not Come to this place!! Huge menu like a true NJ Diner!! Thanks for not making me goto the commercial restaurants near my home!!"}
{"text":"Quick service and good homemade breakfast.  Did go at an off time but it's nice to have a local breakfast place"}
{"text":"(As someone else noted, there are two listings for this diner, so this is posted under both)

Pros: we received our food. Cons: Took 45 minutes to receive food. Two orders were wrong. The biscuit on the breakfast sandwich was dry and stale, and it was missing cheese (only four ingredients - biscuit, egg, cheese, bacon). Received a club sandwich, not an \"Uptown Breakfast Club Sandwich.\" Elected to keep wrong order...poor choice. Club sandwich lacked bread on bottom (?!?), the American Cheese was old, and the bread stale.

Brought these issues to our server, who admitted writing down wrong order and told us \"so sorry\" and walked away, making zero effort to rectify situation. Brought these issues to manager when paying, who also made little effort to rectify situation. After making a scene, the club sandwich was comped.

Two tables left while we were there because they never received their food.
IMO, the menu is way, way, way too big. They need to learn how to execute a simple menu and then, maybe, expand it.

Oh, and the bathroom is horrible."}
{"text":"We almost passed by based on some of the early reviews but glad we didn't. Solid diner. Tried the open face platters and they were really tasty. Chicken soup really hit the spot. Would definitely come back and try some of the breakfast options next time."}
{"text":"Great to have a good diner nearby again.  Loved the steak omelet.  Nice inside, terrific service.  Not open for diner."}
{"text":"The food is good here but the service is extremely slow.  I went today for the 3rd time, thinking maybe they would have it together but they still cannot handle a crowd.  We got there at 1245 and the place was almost completely full.  Its not a very large restaurant.  Two waitresses worked the entire place and it should be about 10 tables each. Our waitress immediately took our drink order and when she returned she said she would come back in a few to see if we were ready to order.  I had to flag her down 15 minutes later.  There were 3 in our party and we ordered soups, salads and sandwiches.  Chili came first and then 15 minutes later came the cup of french onion.  Both were good.  After an hour of being there we finally got our food. Philly cheese steak was good but the meat reminded me of a steak-um.  French fries were really good.  By the time we left it was 210.  If the service gets better I will come back for lunch. Unfortunately I don't have an hour and a half on lunch breaks nor do I want to spend that much time waiting for food.  The other waitress brought out food to multiple tables and our waitress seemed to be a bit slower.  Maybe if there isn't a crowd, I will try it again for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday before the morning rush. We were looking for some good diner options in the area and we tried a variety of foods for our first visit. The Country Fried steak had a pleasant texture and taste, but not sure if it's homemade on site, or bought and fried. At any rate, I liked the texture as some CFS can be hard and chewy and this was easy to eat. The biscuits and gravy also had the same gravy as the country fried steak, but the biscuits were just okay, nothing special. The highlight of the Eggs Benedict were the perfectly poached eggs, but hollandaise just okay. Coffee was good and hot in nice large mugs. Let's talk about the wheat toast, not sure if the toast was made from stale bread but the texture and taste didn't remind me of toast.

The major miss of the experience was the potatoes, and I love potatoes. I tried the homefries and while the potatoes, onions, and peppers were cooked expertly, the nicely browned potatoes lacked in flavor. They were missing something beyond salt and pepper. Next was the cheesy potatoes, which I normally love, but again I could not place what was missing about it. Not bad, not amazing, but very much in the middle that we did not finish it. Cheese and potatoes are a no-brainer winning combo in my book.

And to speak to previous reviews the service was pleasant, and the bathroom was nice! I see they will be opening for dinner soon, and will probably check it out again."}
{"text":"First time here! Short wait for a table, but now that I have my food, I know why!!!! Amazingly good!  Fresh and real ingredients!! Super friendly service!  A definite must try!!!  Yum!!"}
{"text":"How in the world do you describe this place?
My wife and I were part of only 5 customers in the place. The other group received their food when we placed our order. The server that took are drink order  seemed a bit perturbed that I ordered tea instead of coffee I guess. Another server came over to take our order and did so professionaly. 
I ordered the egg white omelete with onions, mushrooms and provolone.
I received an egg white fold with mushrooms, lots of avocado and an oily cheese product, with cold potatoes made yesterday. 
I was afraid to send anything back. 
There was a large family hanging around like they own the place. They do. It's like going to your inlaw/outlaw house for breakfast but you would rather eat before you go and leave as soon as possible so you don't have to listen to their ignorant world view about everything you didn't ask about.
I think the sign on the front window says it all. It says I don't give a Crap about customers just fork over the cash cause we don't take cards.
Food is average at best.
Service is below average.
Decor kinda low.
Atmosphere, run by Tony Soprano's wife.
Attitude worse than can be described.
Sorry"}
