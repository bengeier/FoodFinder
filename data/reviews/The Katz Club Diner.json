{"text":"GF's review: It's like your old friend become a chef and invited you to dinner. The omelette was unexpectedly delicious -- beautiful peppers, tasty                       mushrooms and cheese with a bit of a bite. Stone Oven muligrain bread w/great jam. Good potatoes too.  My stuffed cabbage was as good as grandma's. The Kugel needs golden raisins though.  The seven layer cake was a home run as was the attentive service by Emma. Two cons: 1) The wait for our food was fine dining looooong, not dinner long. 2) Patrons need a house appetizer while waiting-- pickles, bread, something.  Returned the next day for lunch with friends. Service was slooow but worth the wait. Orders included the eggplant reuben, tuna salad, and tuna melt. Everyone left happy."}
{"text":"I was expecting greasy spoon diner food, but this place exceeded my expectations! The food is mostly locally sourced, everything is creative, and delicious. The Gouda Mac n cheese was so cheesy and perfect, the coffee is great, and the eggplant Ruben is a genius alternative for vegetarians who miss some Reuben in their life. Next time I'm definitely checking out the tea, adult shakes, and pastries."}
{"text":"Have driven by this place many times, today we stopped for breakfast.  Excellent food, great service and overall, really good."}
{"text":"So happy to see such great food and an amazing atmosphere taking over this Cleveland Heights landmark.  We had an excellent experience, service was friendly and efficient. (must try the matzah ball soup and the trout) Really liked the coffee bar, we took some treats to go with coffee after lunch and they were all amazing, my cappuccino was made really well and my husbands coffee tasted great.   There were some negative reviews on the parking but I found that it was a plus to have ample space directly outside of the diner and there is tons of street parking and other lots VERY close by.  A few yards walk won't kill you, especially knowing that having parking right out front is unheard of in most cities our size.  Besides Cleveland, from the looks of it a walk would do you good.    The Katz Club was everything that a diner should be with the added plus of being a 'farm to diner' restaurant with really tasty healthy versions of my beloved diner meals. Now I can not wait to try out the bar car.  It looks quite special from the pictures online and I love the idea of having some oysters with a nice classic cocktail.  Hope it's as good as the diner!"}
{"text":"Hard to believe the place exists...first visit last night.  The bar has NO TVs staring at you, just a sophisticated background of great soul and motown hits.  Went for their burgers and bourbon special ($25!) but it was well worth it.  3 Different aged bourbons with a grass fed burger and fries that were indescribably delicious.  Eric at the bar actually introduced himself to everyone there and shared his knowledge about the drinks as he poured.  Great people all around me all enjoying themselves.  Also, they make their own Ho-Ho's which, along with a lot of other delicacies, were on the counter as I left.  Bought one of these giant throw backs and was blown away.  Will make it a point to spend more time here.  Thanks for the experience."}
{"text":"Most of these reviews have been about breakfast.  I went for dinner tonight -- not impressed in the slightest.  If you're in the mood for dinner food, keep driving and spend your dollars elsewhere.  You'll get a lot more for your buck a few minutes down the road.  We were seated immediately at the counter - thought it was a bit weird cause there were tables open, but it's a diner, so the counter experience was fine.  The waiter we got had NO IDEA what was in his food.  I've got nut allergies, and he couldn't answer simple questions about whether there were nuts in some of the items on the menu.  It took FOREVER to get our food -- at least half an hour, and we got a sandwich and a burger.   My sandwich was not worth what I paid for it; the bread was a bit stale and the fries were overcooked.  On top of that, dinner was supposed to come with pickles - we didn't get any, and when we asked for them, we were told that they didn't send them out because they didn't have any of their pickles there, and that the pickles they had were from a jar and that the chef was \"too afraid\" to send out the replacements.  My friend's burger came with ALL the condiments on it - they didn't ask her, nor did they tell her, that that would be the case.  When we were almost done, they sat people immediately next to us even though there were open spots elsewhere at the counter and we didn't have to be packed tightly together."}
{"text":"I hate to write this. Because we LOVE Fire restaurant.   But. we. can't. do. it. again.  Our fourth visit and it keeps getting worse.   45 minutes to receive our orders. (two adults and two teens). Our glasses of very expensive juice FILLED to the tops with ice. (Who puts ice in apple and orange juice?)  The food when it arrived was only fair....  Agree that the restaurant is spotless, parking is limited, wait staff is friendly.  The two essential elements in a diner, speed and good food are missing.   Sorry, but won't be back."}
{"text":"The NEW menu is so much better. The food is much more interesting and delicious! I love Fire so this is much more what I was expecting and hoping for. Last week when we stopped in for brunch we tried the Shakshuka and the Chilaquiles and both were excellent. Heavy, but I read the description so it was no surprise.   After a couple of less than exciting experiences with the old menu we were hesitant to go back but, man oh man, now we can't wait for another excuse to go!"}
{"text":"This place is like an ex-boyfriend: you stay away long enough and you start to remember only the good things, but go back to it and you remember why you've stayed away so long. I've gotten faster and more efficient service in several Latin American countries.   The food is good, though sometimes tries too hard to be unique. The decor/atmosphere is awesome. On the downside, the service, though plenty nice, is incredibly inefficient. It's hard to be told there's an hour wait for a table and 30 minute wait for a counter seat when it appears that a big part of the delay is the inability or unwillingness to bus long-empty tables and seats.  This has been consistent every time I've gone. Once, I watched 5 people bus one four top over the span of 15 minutes. Each person literally took one or two items from the table at a time until it was finally clear. In the meantime, there were so many people waiting that they were spilling outside. There's no reason for that. And that's why I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Don't be confused by the fact that the building looks pretty cool, and the 7 layer chocolate cake is pretty damn good. Because the service is TERRIBLE.  I went in with a friend for an after-dinner coffee and dessert. A simple enough order, right? WRONG. We were ignored even though the diner was completely empty except the four Walking Dead extras dressed in their finest 50s attire that were sloughing around pretending to be waiters.   After what seemed like an eternity, one zombie caught a glimpse of what must have been a shadow of a memory from their human life and listlessly shuffled forward, to take our order.  While zombie #1 was making the coffees, zombie #2 reanimated, producing a haunting utterance which we took as the closest thing to an inquiry of any further desires. We asked to be served a slice of chocolate cake. She stared at us dumbfounded, the life in her eyes gone now. \"Oh...He cuts the cakes,\" she grunted.  You can't cut cakes? We're not drilling to the center of the earth. We're just asking that you slide a piece of thin metal through a piece of soft pastry. But fine. Maybe there's a process that the rest of the human race is simply not privy to about the intricacies of cake separation and distribution.  When we were finally served, zombie #1 walks right by a heaping rack of pristine white coffee mugs and elects instead to pour our drinks into paper to-go cups. Paper cups? What the literal fuck?! This isn't freaking rush hour. Its 9:00 PM; we are obviously here to enjoy a little coffee talk over a slice of cake in your otherwise lovely establishment like normal non-dead humans do.   Finally, the master of cake slicing has freed up a moment of his precious time to slice on our behalf. He walks past a stack of perfectly good desert plates, grabs a to-go box for the cake, and OH HELL NAH! We ain't going nowhere! Put our cake on a plate, mother trucker!   I get it. This is a 50s establishment, and you're just trying to create an authentic experience. And us being a Latina and an African American...we should have known better. Our kind ain't welcome in these parts. Maybe we should have used the back door."}
{"text":"Amazing! The atmosphere is relaxed and the wait staff is a delight. I've enjoyed everything that I've eaten there. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Longtime eastsiders know this location seems to be cursed. It's been the home of some truly bizarre concepts. From the awful Gali Gali to the upscale Clyde's which destroyed the original diner interior, nothing here lasts long. The latest concept comes from Doug Katz and with his track record, he should be able to break the curse. But thanks to some serious issues, even he might not be able to do it.   Lets start with the positives. The place looks great  and much of the ghastly looks of Clyde's are long gone making this once again, a true diner. The omelettes are awesome. The ham is among the best I've had. Hash browns are outstanding. The \"pop tarts\" are genius. Sounds great right? Well, not quite.   The Katz Club Diner suffers from serious service issues. Lets start with serving coffee. Seems easy enough. Normally, a waitress will ask if you want cream with your coffee. That's standard virtually anywhere, even at Denny's, but not here. The coffee was poured and the waitress promptly ran away. Nobody showed up at the table for another 40 minutes. Not even to refill glasses. Finally our waitress lets us know that our food is \"on its way.\"  I'd hope so since I've had shorter waits for much more complex items at Katz's fine dining spot - Fire. I realize virtually everything here is house made but waiting so long for diner food on top of not even getting a drink refill is a tad ridiculous. At least the notice that the food was coming soon allowed the waitress to finally realize she should refill our drinks.   Another 10-20 minutes and the food finally arrives. Here's where more mistakes occur. I get the right side dishes but my omelette is wrong. It's a dining companions. Yes, the omelettes are on the wrong plates. You'd think after waiting this long, the dishes would be correct but nope. Not a big deal but still. Another oddity is the toast is unbuttered. So you'd assume they'd ask if you want jam and/or butter. As happened earlier with the serving of coffee, this simple process is totally bungled. The food runner left without asking or even letting us tell them what we wanted with toast. We had to wait for our waitress to return 10 minutes later to ask for butter and explain the kitchen mixup to her.   3 out of 4 diners at the table liked our meals. The outlier was an egg salad sandwich that lacked flavor. The waitress was kind enough to take it off the bill and offered to bring something else but after waiting so long earlier, my wife didn't want to sit at least another 30-40 minutes just to get a different sandwich. In the time we were there, a neighboring table also sent food back while several others also waited around an hour. I'm wondering if that's the norm or if we came on the wrong day. Either way, its not good and shouldn't ever happen at a Katz restaurant.   Even with our long wait and the kitchen screw ups, no manager ever came to apologize or even check up on us even though one was clearly on the premises. That's disappointing since this is supposed to be an upscale diner as the higher price points show. Sadly, the service resembled that of a greasy spoon that relies on value meals to draw in diners. The kitchen problems were essentially blamed on new cooks in the kitchen who just started there. Not sure why a new restaurant already has new cooks but it might say something about its future and whether this place will last long term. Apparently, the kitchen is chaotic and that's usually a bad sign. Professional and friendly service is a key factor when deciding where to go and this place seems to fail at that in the kitchen and in the dining room.   The Katz Club Diner is loaded with potential and perhaps I'm being harder on it just because of who is at the helm and the fact that Douglas Katz even put his name front and center. Chef Katz is very talented and when I go to a restaurant of his, I expect a top notch experience from top to bottom. It is my fear that Katz has spread himself too thin thanks to this new venture, plus running Fire, Provenance and his growing catering biz. Our last visit to Fire was also full of service missteps and kitchen errors. Katz needs to find some better people working under him or his reputation as a top chef with top restaurants will probably suffer as will his restaurant's long term viability. A restaurant can put out good food but if diners are not having a good time and are not treated right, there's little reason for them to return. Because of that, it might be a long time til we return to this diner no matter how much potential it might have."}
{"text":"Boston cream pie: FIVE STARS  Other stuff: the chicken pot pie is more like chicken and biscuits. I think the flavor could be a little more rich, definitely a 3 stars kind of dish. I also had the chicken/spaghetti dish which was also a 3 stars kind of dish. Mac and cheese: 3 stars.  Boston cream pie, five stars!!!  I basically come in here just for the boston cream pie. It's light and fluffy and not too sweet but the quality of the ingredients really shines through here. Perfection. Even dessert-haters can't help themselves when it comes to this masterpiece of patisserie."}
{"text":"I really like the enviornment a little electic and very friendly servers.  I had the eggant rueben and could not eat it. The eggplant was a bit on the greasy  side. The fries were good though."}
{"text":"one word: inconsistent.  I really want to like Katz Diner. It is close to my house and allows take-away for breakfast, but I just can't.   Let me recollect...The 1st time  I went to Katz Diner the French Toast and Pancakes were amazing, the best I had ever had. The 2nd time the French Toast was over-cooked and dry. The 3rd time, I avoided the French Toast, the pancakes were under-cooked and mushy. The 4th time, everything was great.The 5th time, the pancakes were once again undercooked and mushy. The sixth time, and now my last, the pancakes tasted off, the syrup was juice water, and the ricotta was soupy.   After the 5th time, I called to talk to the manager thinking they had changed their pancake recipe and wanted to vote in favor of the former. Cory, the manager that Saturday morning, treated me rudely. I don't know if they changed chefs, or hired new line cooks, or what, but the quality is very very inconsistent. Sorry Katz Diner, I tried...  update: After eating at Latitude 41, I realized that although Katz has many bugs to work out, that it is far superior than other brunch places with better ratings.  With a bit of relativity, thanks to Lat 41, I upped my star ratings fro Katz"}
{"text":"My husband and I went in the day after the restaurant opened. There were 8 visible employees, all very gracious, one even wearing a tailored suit. We were the only people in the restaurant. The server was stumped by both of our questions about menu items, so we both opted for the safe-bet 2 eggs breakfast, plus I also ordered a spinach salad. The salad was classic, packed to the nines with egg, onion, bacon and cheese, although I wished I'd brought a swimsuit as I nearly drowned in the (delicious) warm bacon vinaigrette. My husbands scrambled eggs were a strange orange color, and we decided were nearly entirely yolk, as if the pastry chef was stealing the whites for his meringues. Hash browns were really awesome! Totally fresh and cooked perfectly dark and crispy on the outside. Our toast came unbuttered....4 slices each, and when we asked for some butter they brought us a 2 oz. ramekin not even a fifth of the way full..essentially one half pat of butter for 8 pieces of toast, so we both had one slice and called it a day. I noted the 6 dollar oatmeal cup could be upgraded to include honey and butter for an additional 2 dollars....so it must be some hand-churned butter. In all it was a great environment, well-cooked and certainly not short staffed, but if you want menu inquiries answered, wait a few weeks for the servers to be trained. And bring your own butter."}
{"text":"The Diner:  This place earns additional points for the atmosphere-- a restored 50s diner car.  This goes on my \"you have to go there once\" list for that reason alone.  That said, the food is good and unique, but I wasn't blown away by the flavors themselves.  The Speakeasy-style Bar Car: YOU MUST try it-- this would get 5 stars.  The drinks are phenomenal and 100% hand-crafted, very reasonable prices, service is great, atmosphere is unique, full food menu is available, all around win."}
{"text":"My five stars are a pay it forward review. Truth is, you're not there yet but when you work the kinks out, I'm sure you will be. May take weeding through (or better training) of the wait staff who just aren't at the level at which they should be. The two managers are and clearly Doug is but the rest of the staff really needs to get the vision or move on. Step up your game servers: refill coffee, don't forget butter, don't forget drinks, don't forget cream for coffee, don't forget potatoes --all of which happened in one meal this am.  Most of the problems were with a well-intentioned but green server. I'm sure in 3-6 months it'll all be worked out.  Food is excellent. Would like to see grass fed beef.  So, it's off to a strong start Katz and company. Thanks and welcome to the hood."}
{"text":"I recently visited while in town and had a fantastic experience. My two young sons and I ate at the counter, which was really fun and made the experience even more authentic to this well designed and light filled diner.  I had a veggie omelet and the boys had hot dogs and burgers. You could tell that everything was fresh and made on site and had similar quality to Chef Katz's other restaurant, Fire. My son declared it to be the second best burger of his entire life. The fries were delicious and we were especially intrigued with the wide variety of impressive desserts. We tried the homemade Oreo and a chocolate chip cookie and left craving more.  I will definitely visit again on another trip for any meal or even late night grub since they are open so late. I only wish that I lived closer to stop on my way to work for a latte and scone.  It's definitely worth getting into your regular rotation. Yum!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it.  I had the eggplant reuben.  It needed a bolder sauerkraut to offset the richness of the eggplant and there was very little sauce and no cheese.  The french fries were soggy.  The food was not the real problem though.  The real problem was the noise level.  I taught high school, so I have a high tolerance for noise, but this place was noisier than a cafeteria filled with teenagers.  Everyone was shouting.  The only way you could have a conversation was to shout too, which isn't fun.  Our bill for two sandwiches and ice tea was $31.  Not cheap.  When we left, I did tell the hostess that the food wasn't bad, but it was way too noisy and I wouldn't be back. Cleveland Hts. has too many good restaurants where, for the same price, you can have a nice lunch and hear yourself think."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. We are from California. Minimal breakfast options but everything was amazing! Service great, coffee great, and definitely try the Chiliquiles breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it's because I had super high expectations for this place or if there actually is something a little off, but I just can't get into it. That said, I'm willing to give it another try because I want it to be awesome and feel like it is.  The first time we went was before the menu revamp and things were just OK. The entire car was full of sad looking people and we were the only people under 60, save for a family dining with their children. The atmosphere was very blase and the food was on par with that feeling. It felt like I could have had the same thing cheaper somewhere else and with more excitement. I even felt kind of bad drinking a beer with my dinner. The homemade twinkies and swiss rolls are pretty delicious, and I'm not a huge dessert person (unless it's pie), but I really liked them.  After the menu revamp, we visited the bar car, which I was most excited about. I had a dirty martini that was delicious and a fish wrap of some sort that really impressed. The problem was that I could barely see my own hand in front of my face. I'm one of those people that needs to see my food as I'm eating it, so perhaps eating in the bar car was a bad decision. I also have to note that they have these unique not crunchy pickles that aren't really my thing, but they're a curious addition to the meals.   Like I said, I know we'll be back because I really feel the potential, but it just hasn't hit its mark yet."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Saturday around noon and were seated almost immediately. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive and we ordered the Oreo milkshake to start, which was very good. We then split a bowl of the smoked chicken soup which was delicious and for mains I got the eggplant Reuben and my boyfriend got the omelette.  I would say the Reuben was average and probably wouldn't order it again (a good option for vegetarians, but just didn't do it for me) but my boyfriend really enjoyed his meal.  The environment is sunny, friendly and really has that diner feel. This place would appeal to people of all ages. It is quite small so probably wouldn't be good for a large party. Overall we really enjoyed our time here and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"You know the situation... you read a bunch of trusty reviews from your fellow Yelpers who tell you the wait time for food is too long and the food is mediocre but you hope beyond hope they are wrong and you decide to go to the restaurant anyway?  Yep, that is what happened tonight....4 of us went for dinner on a Saturday night at 6:15.  We were quoted a wait time of 15 minutes and it was 30 minutes.  The food on the menu SOUNDS delicious...Miller grass fed beef, Gouda Mac and cheese, lemon vinaigrette, etc.  It took 45 MINUTES to receive our food and the diner was nearly empty.  On top of that, one of us never received a chocolate milkshake until I reminded our server about it.  The \"grass-fed\" burger was a complete joke.  Two patties (they didn't even ask us how we wanted it cooked...it automatically came out well done).  You get a better burger at any fast food joint for $8 less.  Fries were soggy.  Milkshake barely had any flavor.  Salad didn't have dressing on it.  And the person at the table who ordered a bun-less burger had her burger show up on a bun.  This place is NOT kid-friendly either... No kids menu or any crayons, games, etc.  Completely disappointing and a waste of time and money.  I will never go back.  Cool concept but horribly flawed execution..."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I tried really hard, but it just didn't work out. We went there at 1pm on Sunday and were sat basically right away, which was nice. The decor was very cute, comfy chairs and very clean.  We were disappointed when we received the menu and their breakfast items are very  limited after 11am everyday, even Sunday. You are limited to just french toast, pancakes and eggs. They will not even make a breakfast sandwich for you, but they will make an egg, bacon and toast on a plate for you to assemble yourself. No eggs benedict. No oatmeal. They only offer part of their lunch and dinner menu at 1pm as well, so we were even more limited.  I ordered scrambled eggs with home fries and sausage. The eggs were runny and not completely cooked. The home fries had no flavor or seasoning. The sausage tasted like a mix of sweet italian and breakfast sausage. I couldn't have more than 1 bite of them.  My boyfriend had a burger and it was very small - he actually called it a slider! It was just ok. Lacked flavor and seasoning as well.  We spent $33 with the tip and I left hungry. We will not be going back. The only reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1 - our service was pretty good and the place was cute. Not enough of a reason to go back though."}
{"text":"This place is nice clean, dining car that serves up fresh options for the diverse population of Cleveland Heights.  The service is good, but can get slow when the place isn't busy which was odd.  I tried the vegan burger, and was so happy I did.  It had spice, texture, freshness, and juiciness...everything you want from a burger.  It wasn't greasy and didn't taste like cardboard like most veggie burgers.  In addition to the diner, they have a bar attached on the other side of the lot and a coffee and pastry counter between them."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. It was excellent because of how different they make it compared to other restaurants. When you order a burger at most restaurants, there isn't a huge difference. Katz Club puts their own spin on every dish. The staff was extremely professional and courteous. We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"When you first walk in, you're definitely amazed by how nice the place looks. Everything is shiny and oh so pretty. It's exactly how you'd imagine a diner to look.   We went around 1 in the afternoon, so we missed the big rush. Otherwise, the place is a bit small and you're probably likely to hit some wait.   The food is a little expensive for what it is (9 dollars for a 3 egg omelet with sausage and mushrooms and 11 dollars for an eggplant rueben). The menu is also a bit confusing to read. Their base omelet (apparently with NOTHING in it....so essentially 3 eggs) costs 7 dollars?   I thought the food was also a little too greasy. The eggplant was so soggy with oil that you could barely taste the eggplant. It was mostly oil. I couldn't tell that it was a rueben at all. The homefries were also pretty well lathered in butter.   But for the ambience of the place, 3 stars seems well deserved. But for taste, I'd still head over to the Inn on Coventry if I can."}
{"text":"Awesome from start to finish my wife was in the mood for breakfast I wanted dinner & a drink so we decided to give Kats club but try,my wife ordered French toast and bacon with fresh berries the bacon some of the best I've ever had the berries were fresh and plentiful success I ordered the trout which was outstanding taste freshness and presentation, they make a great cocktail. And if it couldn't get any better I had a coffee drink after dinner so delightful as well as the homemade ice cream are server as good as the meal I must applaud the management here we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian and vegan choices! The Mac and cheese was creamy. The eggplant Reuben was crisp and tangy. The faux Ho was an upgrade on the original. Te vegan burger, however, was dry and had very little flavor. I'd skip it. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. The space is retro cool."}
{"text":"This review is only for the bar side - I've yet to try the diner (but heard great things about the brunch).   My husband and I went a few weeks ago to try it out. I loved the decor and the overall vibe of the bar car! This is definitely something new and different to the bar scene in Cleveland Heights, and I love it!   We arrived early on a Friday night, and it was pretty slow that early in the night. The drinks were delicious (Cosmo and Old Fashioned), but the cocktail menu was pretty limited and could use some creative additions to keep with the speakeasy style.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It is thrilling that at long last there is a business that will be a success occupying the diner cars on Lee Rd.   The updating and polishing done to the space is remarkable. It is clean, bright and polished. The tables and chairs have the perfect period touch and are comfortable to boot. I've not seen a more well done updated vintage space.   The menu offers the expected diner items plus several vegetarian versions of those comfort food favorites as well as day of the week specials.   Our weekend morning visit meant that only breakfast items were available and while I was initially disappointed that I couldn't try the Vegetable Soup and Meatloaf from the dinner menu, in the end it was a good thing as it led me to order breakfast which is something I don't normally do. I had the mushroom hash and loved it. The potatoes were crisp outside and creamy in the middle. The mushrooms and onions were savory and delicious and there was a generous portion of them tossed in with the potatoes.   Between those dining at our table we tried the rye and the white (scala?) breads, the house cured ham, bacon and house-made breakfast sausage. Most of the bread options are from the local bakery, Stone Oven, that does very nice artisan breads. The white bread is made in house and made for rich, chewy, satisfying toast. The house-cured bacon and ham got A grades from all at the table but for me the fresh breakfast sausage stole the show. Perfectly seasoned, savory and herby, it is what all breakfast sausage should be and together with the mushroom hash may make a breakfast person out of me.   The coffee is a solid middle ground choice, nice depth, a polished cup without being too strong for those who don't enjoy a strong cup.   The pastries, cakes, pies, donuts etal are all made in house down to the sprinkles on the donuts. They all looked divine and we enjoyed our donut selections. The house-made blueberry preserves that were served with breakfast were lovely, as nice as my own. We learned that the ice cream for the sundaes is made in-house and the ice cream for the shakes is from the local ice cream maker, Mitchell's.   I'm eager to return soon to work my way through the dinner menu. I have no doubt that the comfort diner dishes put out by Katz's kitchen will be finessed versions of old favorites.   Bravo and welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I bought the Travelzoo deal for this place a while ago, and finally got the chance to try it out recently!   Ambiance: My first impression of this place is that it's a very clean and similar to a traditional 50s dinner. I love the wall decor!   Food: For drinks, I got the mocha and my boyfriend got the latte. The mocha was very delicious, and my boyfriend said the latte was a bit bitter. For entrees, I got the beef hash. It was very yummy! I love the contrast between the salty meat and eggs with the sour cabbage :) Contrary to what other yelpers have said, I thought this was a huge portion. My boyfriend got the 3 omelet, which was also a huge portion and quite delicious! Make sure you try their hash browns! Very unique flavors because they season it with rosemary :) For side, we ordered the seasonal fruit cup. This was totally not worth the $6 as listed.   Service: Very nice servers! They kept checking up on us to make sure we're doing all right :)   Overall, great place for some traditional American food. I gave it 4 stars because 1) it took about 30 minutes for the food to come out after we had ordered and 2) I would probably never eat here if it weren't for the Travelzoo deal because the prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"Finally made it here! Parked near Cain Park, about two hours before the Michael McDonald concert, and walked over to the Katz Club. Good plan, and even though they don't take reservations, the turnover was fairly brisk and we only waited for about 10 minutes. The two dining cars have been wonderfully restored and there is now a central structure that links the two. The overall effect is really stunning inside and out. Service was spot on and this surprised me a little as they are open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner........a lot of staff to train for a new restaurant. Granted, it is a new venture for Doug Katz ,and is now his third location to be spawned from his awesome \"Fire, Food and Drink\"......so it's not totally new, and there are a lot of similarities in the sensibility of the food and the attention to detail by the wait staff. (Good job!) The food is a bit of \"old time\" diner fare with a lot of modern updates. I had the \"8oz pan seared sirloin\" (with yummy fries) and it was a delight! My friend had the \"crispy baked trout\" which had a hint of dill,(I think??) and was excellent (I Know!!!). They don't serve wine or alcohol on Sunday and the \"Bar\" car was therefore not open, but I'll definitely be back to give that side a try!!"}
{"text":"I have patronized every previous version of these diner cars since the first version, and I hope I can say that this version will \"stick\".    Our party of 4 sat in the \"bump out\" section, off the main room, so that meant a bit less noise, but on this 95+ degree day, it also meant that the AC from the main room was not making it into this section well.  There was a small fan in the room, but I would suggest a shade be added to the interior of the south side window because it made for a warm room with nothing to fight the sun rays.  Not unbearable, but there is room for improvement.  Not much of a view from that window, so a window covering that would keep that room cooler would be a good investment.  The food - was really good!  I had the all beef hot dog with HOMEMADE potato chips! Holy moly, those were great!  The hot dog bun was like a bakery style bun, which I like vs. the nothing generic buns.  Everyone at our table liked their food, especially the root beer float.    In my opinion, good place for a meal before a show at Cedar Lee theater, which is what our plans were.  Service was fine, the waitresses wear interesting aprons (a nice touch), and seemed very comfortable with the menu, unlike the previous versions of the diner cars.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I am a huge brunch/breakfast fan, and an even bigger diner fan.  This place honestly blew me away.   A friend from out of town was here for just a day and the only time we could meet up was for an early 8 AM breakfast.  I found this on a yelp search near where she was staying and figured we'd give it a try.   When I arrived I was so impressed with how clean, updated and new it looked inside.  The outside is adorable and the inside has all new leather chairs, bright clean counters, tables and silver everywhere! I loved it and felt so comfortable and at home. They had a bakery/cafe side, then tables, and a long bar to sit at.    They had some fun summer/spring coffee and tea special drinks, I'm just a black coffee girl so I didn't order any but they seemed like they would be really good.  I ordered the 'Local Farmers Table' which includes eggs, bacon, hash browns, fruit, toast, and grits.  The staff was incredibly kind and friendly and let me switch my bacon for sausage and I said I didn't want grits and she offered a ton of other options including french toast, pancake, extra egg etc. which I didn't expect so I ordered a pancake to try and split between me and my friend.    The food wasn't rushed out to know it was maybe served off a line but came out fresh, hot, homemade and honestly perfect for what I wanted.  It was a very large portion too (I guess I could of guessed that), but I only ate half my meal and was stuffed.  I honestly don't have a thing to complain about.  Great staff, atmosphere, and food!   They even included a coffee to go for me on my way to work.  I would love to try it for something other than breakfast but if you are on the east side, I would say this should be at the top of your list to try!"}
{"text":"Doug Katz is a genius with his vegan offerings on vegan Thursdays. The stuffed squash blossoms were wonderful. It's a shame that as summer comes to an end, so do the vegan Thursdays."}
{"text":"Ive tried both breakfast on the weekend and dinner on a weekday here.   I grew up in new york and new jersey where there are diners everywhere. Ive lived here for 5 years and I've been dying for a decent diner. We've tried big al's, the shaker square diner, clifton diner, but none of them come close to back home. And im not sure why its so hard to replicate here. So with this in mind, I had high hopes for katz.  The waiters were very nice. The diner is nice, but small. Are they trying to be a little more of an upscale diner with the wine and the higher prices? 11 dollars for an average burger and fries...about the same as b-spot price...and six dollars for a cup of matzah ball soup. Now...matzah ball mix is dirt cheap. The celery and carrots are dirt cheap. Back in NJ a cup of matzah ball is 2.50-3.50. If you go to harolds at the meadowlands, a matzah ball the size of a bowling ball runs 8 dollars. This was no six dollar matzah ball. It was ok, nothing most of us couldnt make at home with 30 minutes of effort...which would yield a giant pot with 10-12 balls.  the burger was ok. paprika onions? didnt taste them. Tasted mostly the fat in the burger. French fries were average. Doesnt even come close to bar cento rosemary fries on the west side.  So all in all, its worth maybe one try to see if you like it. But unfortunately, where they are at right now, its not going to be a place that I come back to."}
{"text":"i'm with Rachael N. on this one, i love diners! and the katz club diner is a pretty great one. it is actually one of the only breakfast/brunch places on the east side really, so props to them. i came here on a rainy saturday morning, pretty early, after another one of those terrible night shifts. actually i got there around 6:30 and they didn't open til 7. i took a nap in my car. i got some sort the omelette. oh it was so good. ok it was a little greasy but it was delicious. i have to go back for the other food because so much of the menu looks tasty. also, they have a bunch of vegetarian/vegan options. the real deterrent is their prices. i think their menu is you know kinda fancy, but everything is just a dollar or couple more than i want to pay. def want to try the vegan quinao pasta and the black swamp gouda mac and cheese mmm  oh i did also go to the speakeasy side on a separate occasion! there's a side door, you go in and everything is purple velvet and brown leather. the drinks were good, but again, just a dollar or couple more than i want to pay. it needs a little something else, i'm not sure what, although maybe it was that the little stools weren't very comfortable to sit on, or that the lights were a little too bright. i went with a group of girls. i think it'd be nicer to take someone out here for a little something romantic."}
{"text":"I was eager to try the Katz Cub Diner ever since I heard it would occupy this fantastic space. I tried it today and was not disappointed.   The space is beautiful. Bright and clean - it's got a contemporary feel, while still retaining its old school charm. We had a short wait for a table but I enjoyed a latte from the coffee bar, which helped make the wait much more enjoyable. The service was great. We sat at the bar and our waitress was delightful, very friendly and professional.   The food was excellent. Our party of three enjoyed dishes that were hearty and delicious. The ingredients were fresh and the food seemed more like home cooked meals than restaurant food.   I really enjoyed everything about the Katz Club Diner. It was a great experience where everything came together perfectly - ambience, service and food. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We walked in to have breakfast here for the first time today, and as I checked out yelp, I was intrigued by the mixed reviews. This was an 8AM breakfast on a weekday and when we walked in, the place was almost empty. We had a pleasant and engaging server who had a natural rapport about him. We find out this place gets pretty much mobbed on weekday lunch and on breakfast weekend hours.  The breakfast was great. I ordered the classic bacon and eggs breakfast they had at the top of the menu, which I would recommend. The tastiest part of this breakfast was the potato hash because they used whole, mini b-potatoes with skin seared to a crunchy potato-chip-like texture that tasted pleasantly onion-y, garlicky and herb-y . Hash potatoes sometimes suffer from sogginess -- not his one. Bacon was thick cut, which was another plus. My s/o ordered the deliciously fluffy pancakes on a thankfully-not-too-sweet cherry reduction.  The price of $35 for 2 people, to me, for the quality of what we ate, was way more than fair. If you want to go any lower on the price point, then you'd have to skip on a few wonderful ingredient details (like whole fresh potatoes, art on your latte, home-made cherry sauce, fresh berries, home-made sourdough) and will basically translate to a place like Bob Evans. Price it any higher -- then we're talking brunch at Fire where more twists ergo, pricier ingredients, are to be expected.  I love the architecture and the nostalgia-inducing interior. Diners like this were prevalent at a time of American optimism and wonder. Sadly, along with American optimism, there's only a few of them left these days. Finally, a few theories on why I think there are mixed reviews: (1) when this place gets too crowded, the added task and time pressure might affect service (2) too-high expectations for the Katz name? maybe.  As a first-timer, my verdict is that I'm coming back -- but will continue to avoid times when it is crowded."}
{"text":"I always end up writing a lot of 5 star reviews, but it's only because I really want to share my great experience! This place is definitely one of those places! Delicious, and a great ambiance."}
{"text":"Katz does everything right: creative menu, healthy, locally grown, historic adaptive reuse of two dining cars, great service, sinfully clean, indie music on the hi-fi, cute waitresses...what's not to love? Try the eggplant Reuben. Open for breakfast and served all day long. THIS is how to run a restaurant, people"}
{"text":"The food was a little slow today, but tremendously busy.  Worth the wait!  The corn beef hash and pancakes A+. Next time I would like to try the omelets that looked even better!  To boot, the service is ultra friendly + accommodating."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for breakfast.  Like another user said, I really want to like this place.  The moment you step in you get an instant hipster vibe.  It's a throwback to 40's, 50's, 60's type of diner with a bit more class.  The staff is all tatted up and a bit aloof but whatever.    The first time we went we had a groupon and the place was absolutely packed. No seat was empty and the bar seating was full to capacity.    However, we were seated rather quickly (at the bar) and the food arrived quickly despite the number of people inside. I ordered their whole wheat pancakes which includes whipped ricotta and Michigan cherry syrup.   I opted for no ricotta and regular pancake syrup.  I had bacon and eggs ala carte.    It was decent.  It tasted good, but not unlike anything I could (and usually do) make at home.     My second visit was this past fathers day, June 15th.  I went again with my girlfriend, mother and father.  At about 10:00am we walked right in and got a seat as the place was not nearly as packed on our first visit.  The bar had half its seats available and one or two tables were open.    I ordered the same meal as before except this time IT TOOK FORTY FIVE MINUTES FOR OUR MEAL TO ARRIVE.  Just ridiculous.  I flagged our waitress down who was clearly avoiding our table because our drinks were empty for a good 20 minutes and asked where our food was. She said our food is getting ready to come out, which was an outright lie because we waited another 20 minutes before our meals arrived.  Because our waitress was avoiding our table, I had to ask one of the girls who was cleaning and clearing tables to go find her.   I suspect they had a food shortage because I noticed one of the bus boys walking back to the restaurant from the Zagara's Market across the street with both arms full of grocery bags.   In the end, breakfast for four came to 58 bucks, a forty five minute wait and no apology for sub par service.      2 stars. I'll pass on this place next time and go somewhere else for breakfast."}
{"text":"A fun spot with pretty good food to match, Katz Club Diner is probably a \"stretch four\" that gets bonus points for offering a refreshing take on usual diner fare.  The Chicken a la King was alright--bits of chicken, peas, and carrots on top of a quartered Belgian waffle, it was aptly described by our server as a chicken pot pie without the pie.  The sauce was pretty heavy, making this a rather filling dish.  The bits of chicken were a little disappointing, and given the heaviness of the sauce, I wonder if the waffle could benefit from being just slightly overcooked.  I don't regret having the dish, but I'd probably opt for something else on my next visit.  True to diner form, the restaurant serves breakfast all-day, and the Local Farmer's Table--2 eggs, tandoor smoked bacon, potatoes, and grits--was very well received.  The bacon, which I sampled, was excellent--crispy, unnervingly flat, but still with a hint of meatiness inside and with a little extra taste from the smoking.  For dessert, we chose from the selection of daily-made desserts stored in a number of glass stands near the entrance.  The slice of 7-layer chocolate cake was good (but not great) but did benefit from a controlled sweetness where it would have been tempting to indulge and go overboard.  I did like that one of the dessert options, along with homemade Twinkies and Faux Ho's (which weren't there at the time), was \"Birthday Cake\" which, indeed, was a birthday cake complete with \"Happy Birthday\" written in frosting on the top of the cake.  Service was attentive by diner standards, but about on par for any above-average restaurant.  While the furnishings are generally true to the diner car concept, I did appreciate the very cushioned and comfortable chairs at the tables.  Scanning a couple of the other reviews, I could see how crowds and waiting could be a problem given the size of the restaurant.  Fortunately, there was no wait for our Sunday night dinner, so that hassle isn't factored into this review."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner Saturday night, and it was an overall pleasant experience. We'd been thinking about heading out to Shaker Square, but my husband had read about this place.  We liked the idea of spending less than we generally would in Shaker Square, and we love Doug Katz. Mostly we were excited to try out some upscale diner food.    The ambiance was nice-super cute!  The diner car was obviously not as crowded as the bar car on a Saturday night and the atmosphere was cool.  Next time we will have to try the Bar Car.   We liked having the option between the diner car and the bar car.  My husband and I are kind of weird in that when we go out on weekends we really hate overcrowded places.  Going to the diner car on a weekend evening seems like a good choice for others like us.  However, it did fill up, and I will say that the section was somewhat understaffed.  As far as I could tell, there was one waitress taking care of the entire diner car, and while she was pleasant, she seemed to be taking her time in getting things taken care of.   The thing that surprised me about this place was that the traditional diner-y type foods we tried were somewhat so-so. The pickles weren't as crunchy as we like (We understand that that's the product of them being house-made, but I was disappointed because I had such high expectations.)  We tried a root beer float, because it just seemed fun.  Again, it was just so-so.  It might have been that the ice cream was just average, but we were expecting it to be really good, so again, disappointing.  The fries that came with my husband's sandwich had a good flavor, but seemed like they were first overcooked and then left to sit out for a while, not a great combination.  On the flip side, there were a couple things we got that were absolutely fantastic.  My husband started his dinner with a side salad with the lemon vinaigrette.  It was SO good.  It was very simple, just greens and dressing, but the dressing was so good and refreshing that I found myself wishing I had ordered a salad instead of the root beer float.  It's got to be a pretty darn good salad to make that happen!    He got the turkey sandwich, and I got the chicken a la king.  His sandwich was delicious, but my dinner was amazing.  I was not one hundred percent aware of what chicken a la king was when I ordered it, I imagined it to be more traditional chicken and waffles.  However, it was more like a chicken pot pie filling over a house made Belgian waffle.  It was REALLY good.  My husband normally gets my restaurant leftovers, but I found myself fighting him for these.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.     Overall, we liked this place. As I described in my review, there were some things that could have been better, but thinking back on my dinner, I can't give the place less than four stars, despite the other shortcomings.  The prices were fairly reasonable, there was a good selection of different things. I would also recommend this as a good place to take your Bob Evans loving family if you're trying to get them to try new things.  I have family members who are very averse to eating at \"fancy\" non-chain restaurants. However between the atmosphere, reasonable prices, and the menu options that are simple but made with higher quality ingredients, I think most people would like this place. I look forward to coming back again and seeing if this place will live up to the potential I can tell that it has."}
{"text":"Went back for another try and were pleasantly surprised that the new, a little more limited, menu netted a better experience. Breakfast anytime yielded a delish Shortrib Chilaquiles, a little pricey at $15, but good. Also had the Katz Club sandwich that came with a great serving of fresh cut fries. A pretty cappuccino and Bobbie's cake ended dinner on a high note, loved the toasted coconut and perfect cream cheese frosting on a yummy yellow cake."}
{"text":"This review is only for the diner side, not for the bar side.  I wanted this place to be awesome. Hopefully that isn't part of the reason I have to rate it so low. Were my expectations too high?  Katz club diner is a really cool little restaurant on paper. They use fresh local ingredients, it's in a old school style diner car that has been redone quite nicely on the inside, they have nice era style outfits, glasses, and etc. the rising star coffee is really good. They brew it properly and you can come in and go to their little coffee bar to get a cup to go. They also have pastries/cookies by the coffee bar.  However, the cons far outweigh the pros.  We arrived at about 11:30 on a Saturday. Luckily someone is just pulling out as if not there would be nowhere to park! There were people waiting for a seat. However, we were offered a high top/bar spot and to which we could be seated immediately. Upon sitting down our waitress asked us what wed like to drink; or should I say tried to ask us. The noise level in this place at 11:30 was so loud that we'd basically have to shout to respond. My girlfriend could barely hear her voice which lead to some confusion. After a cup of coffee we were asked what we want to eat. I ordered the 3 egg omelette with peppers, cheese, and bacon. My girlfriend had the French toast and a side of seasonal fruits. We sat and drank coffee as our stomaches continued to grow more impatient. finally the food arrives!! A quick glance at my watch would reveal it is 12:30.  Nearly an hour to make some french toast and an omelette? The French toast was very tasty and my omelette was very good. And, as I said before, so was the coffee. But was it worth the extensive wait? Ehhhh... Not really.  Unfortunately I've been to many far busier establishments where my food comes much much faster. I understand that the Katz club diner is trying to be a bit more up-scale but I don't think that really fits with the environment. I feel like a diner should be a quick grab and go with diner quality food. Also, the bill came to $32 before tip. I couldn't fault the waitress because she did refill our coffees promptly and gave her my standard 20%. $38 for two people to eat breakfast?  Major issues: -Price: too high for me... Not too high for my wallet, too high for the wait, the noise level, and the other issues -Slow Food: I'm a hungry guy! -Parking: not enough. -noise level: what did you say??  Pros: -Coffee: tastes good but definitely not reason enough to come here -Style: proper diner car style -Coffee bar: great idea for people who want a cup to go but with the limited parking I think you'd be better off going elsewhere for you daily morning drip  Would I return? I might.. But to check out the bar side."}
{"text":"I love it I love it I love it!  This is like the foodie, hip version of your standard diner. Its in a diner car. Food is delicious (get the mushroom hash- amazing). No frills. This place just feels wholly down to earth, honest and genuine. Yes I just described a diner as honest and genuine. I don't know how that happened.  I've also been to the bar car next door. I almost can't believe a little speakeasy style bar like this exists in this part of town. You'll see elderly couples there after dinner on a date night, a group of 20somethings, and anything in between- and it fits for all. It's classy, swank, and totally unique.  Keep up the great work Katz!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was a bit disappointed....pricey and mediocre. The chicken noodle soup  had the requisite chicken, carrots, and celery, but had an overbearing taste of turnips or parsnips. Would have preferred an authentic basic Jewish broth. The $11  club sandwich had a fried egg inserted next to the bread. Didn't make much sense and seemed to interfere the classic taste of a club. The accompanying fries were great.   Looking around the room, I saw the chicken a la king where the waffels dominated the plate,  with a meager count of little dark meat morsels. The $11 hamburger looked like Mawby's with grilled onions, but could be consumed in three bites.  The staff was freindly and attentive, but I think it really makes sense to go there for breakfast. But it probably wouldn't be as good as Corky's or Jack's."}
{"text":"It's a bit of a wait and a little pricey but overall very delicious and good service!"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Fire Food and Drink I feel it is among the best in Ohio for those who don't know Chef Katz is the owner of both places. So my expectations for the diner were extremely high but I was truly disappointed in the food it was very average at best. ( it seemed they ran out of salt.) and after waiting such a long time for everything I had to get up and get some air because it was SOO HOT inside I was dripping sweat at the table not how I enjoy eating my dinner!! A shame because it such a cool place."}
{"text":"Went at prime time, Sunday at noon.   Overall experience was ok at best.  Parking  lot is small, went in circles a few times, then ended up parking across the street. Waited about a half hour for our group of 4.  We got a table, but do know you may be placed at counter.  They have a separate coffee station so u can just come in and order a regular or fancy coffee to go or while u wait.  Chairs at the tables were cushy!  pretty tight quarters, hitting elbows with my son sitting next to me the entire time.  Wait staff is SLOW!  Which I can't understand cause there is not that many tables and there were 3 waitresses and a 4th cleaning tables.  Waited a good 10 minutes for Coffee to b poured and then another 8 minutes for the cream!  10 more minutes after that and she took our order!  So make sure u have time to go here!  Food was good.   Banana chocolate shake was good and made with real bananas.  French toast was very good.  Pastrami sandwich was very good! Egg sandwich on their \"English\" muffin was good.  The club sandwich with egg was not that great.  I had to deconstruct it just to eat it!  It was a mess, everything falling out, and the egg did not seem to go with the overall taste of sandwich.  Turkey pretty dry and overall just a bland sandwich.   It was a good, 'we tried it once'  type of place, but not sure I would go through all that just to eat there again.  Ps. Regular Coffee was good and the mocha is made w/chocolate ganache and vanilla, was pretty good but tasted like a glorified chocolate milk."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a friend. Had reservations in the bar car, which was cozy but not really amenable for eating without a lot of drinking as well. Bartender was very nice and not at all upset that my friend just got a soft drink and I had a glass of wine. Food was a little expensive but tasty. Not at all crowded for an early dinner at 6:15 on a weekday night. Might come back, but overall not outstanding."}
{"text":"I've only been here once for brunch, but really, really enjoyed it! An excellent menu and our food was great. My multi-cheese omelet was a little on the greasy side, and would probably make great hangover food. The homemade jam was a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Yes, another 5 stars from me!  We have been here twice in the evening and only in the bar car which we absolutely enjoy. We were pleasantly surprised at what was behind the shiny exterior of this hidden treasure in Cleveland Heights. In fact, I would say that we were elated upon finding this place.  I would surmise there are perhaps two different experiences in this restaurant with regard to atmosphere and service as well as time of day visited. I am surprised the overall rating for this place isn't higher.   First off, the bartenders here are superior in their creations of cocktails.They are masters of mixology and to watch them create is a pleasure itself.  The offerings are quite exquisite. I am so happy they have absinthe and chartreuse!  The GINNTANG drink is beautiful and sooooo delicious! The menu lists a pitcher of ABSINTHE if you are daring enough to order such an extravagance. This is on my list of future \"to do's\" as I look forward to a night of hallucinations and bizarre dreaming (if you have ever had absinthe, you will know what I mean)!!!   The food is very good!  Everything we have tried so far has been perfect. The Katz Club sandwich was beautifully presented and oh so tasty! The Vegan Curried Lentil Soup is unique in flavor.  The Spinach and Frisee salad was also very good and has fresh, crisp ingredients. Add the chicken to the salad and it will deliver a smooth, smoky overall flavor to the dish. We even had room for a piece of their birthday cake which was \"melt in your mouth\" texture and deliciously sweet in the right way.   The bar car has such a cool vibe and the lighting gives it such a sexy ambiance. They had soft R&B playing in the background which we love so much. I truly feel happy and relaxed when I am sitting in this hideaway. I have to say that I find this place to be one of my absolute favorites in the area.   I highly recommend the Katz Club Diner to anyone who is looking for a relaxed, slower paced evening where you want to enjoy a special libation and delicious food in a \"speak easy\" environment."}
{"text":"Had one of the best lunches of the year here, 2 wks ago. Had the smoked chicken soup and the burger with bacon/fried egg. The soup is absolutely fantastic, and great service as well. This is my second trip here, and loving the new menu."}
{"text":"Another bullseye by Doug Katz...  Went here a few days after it opened.  Hit the Cedar  Lee for a movie, then on to the diner for some conversation and a sandwich.  The staff was accommodating, there was a line, but they were able to get us a seat at the counter.  I had the diner style burger, my date had the turkey club.  Both were great.  I can't wait to try their brunch - I am sure it will be wonderful.  I am glad this place is so close to my house, I am sure it will do really well."}
{"text":"To sum up my experience - I was disappointed.   I'd been excited to try Katz Club Diner since I'd heard about its opening. The menu sounded interesting. And any place that offers vegan grub here in the CLE will get my business at least once.   My mom, boyfriend, and I were seated at the counter on a late Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was pretty full, but the counter was empty. Our server - in her retro black waitress getup - was nice but inexperienced. I asked her about upgrading the vegan dog to \"the works\" and asked her what \"the works\" was. She had no idea. Good thing I pressed her to ask because \"the works\" includes non-vegan cheese and sour cream. My mom asked her about the eggplant Reuben. Again, she had limited knowledge of what was on the sandwich. I get that this is diner dining, but the wait staff should have some idea of what's being served. Right?  We waited for what seemed like an unusually long time for our food, watching delicious looking plates of food coming out of the kitchen. When the food arrived, only 2 of our 3 orders arrived - my vegan dog with fries and my mom's eggplant Reuben with fries. Apparently they'd run out of fries, so my boyfriend had to wait another 10 minutes for them to make another batch. And so, my mom and I had to wait another 10 minutes to eat our meals. Honestly, we would have been happier if they'd left our food under a warmer, because it was pretty awkward for us to be sitting there, waiting for my boyfriend to get his food.    Once everyone had a meal in front of them, we dug in. My vegan dog was good...but not worth the price tag. $8 for a Field Roast sausage that I can buy at Whole Foods with the saltiest fries I've ever eaten? Meh. (and I'll add a disclaimer here - I love salt more than anyone I know and I still thought the fries were too salty) My mom's Reuben was equally underwhelming. When I think Reuben, I think overflowing sandwich. Her sandwich had a cutlet of eggplant with a dab - literally - of Thousand Island dressing - and a minuscule amount of sauerkraut.   My boyfriend's burger wasn't much better. He thought it was ok, but like the fries, he thought it was too salty. Not sure why someone in the kitchen was being so heavy handed with the salt that day, but...it kind of ruined our meal.  So overall, we had a pretty \"meh\" experience. The food was ok, but nothing special. Unless you consider \"overly salted\" to be special. I had hoped to frequent this diner since I live relatively close, but after my experience there, I'm honestly in no rush to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing! EVERYTHING is made from scratch. The butter is churned in house, jelly made daily, and delectable pastries including twinkles, ho-hos, pop tarts and Oreo cookies!! Delicious twist on corn beef hash!  Yum!!!!!"}
{"text":"The decor (classic chrome diner) is beautiful, the wait staff was very attentive, and the food was delicious and entirely fresh.  They make their own cherry jam (and use it to make pop tarts!) and their own english muffins.  My friends quite enjoyed the latkes that came with their breakfast.  The sausage for my omelette was unique and tasty, and farmer's cheese isn't a typical available option.  They've only been open seven weeks or so, we were told, and while we didn't see what they were like when packed, it was great first thing in the AM.  I am sure we will be back.  I also want to try out the 20's speakeasy in the car next to the diner (same building).  Our waittress said it's open Wednesday-Saturday, can't wait to check it out.  Next time I will check out their pastries, which are made from scratch by them."}
{"text":"I love the concept and the food was good, but I really hoped for better. They have room to improve. My review could be colored by the fact that our server was surly and underinformed about the menu, but objectively the food wasn't where it should be for a \"name\" chef churning out interesting twists on diner fare. The space is really nice. I hope the food and staff match it one day."}
{"text":"Diner which is a little bit on the expensive side, but justified by the freshness of the ingredients and quality of the food.  I came to this diner for Sunday brunch by recommendation of a few friends.  I had driven by this diner on a weekly basis not realizing that it was considered an \"upscale diner\".  If this was evident earlier, I would probably have come to check it out earlier.  I ordered the Local Farmer's Table for breakfast.  The dish came with eggs, grits, tandoor smoked bacon, fresh fruit, home fried potatoes (called the smash browns), and toast.  As mentioned, the price is a little expensive for breakfast, especially at a diner.  The food seemed fresher than in other diners for breakfast.  My favorites were the grits and the jelly which accompanied the toast.  The tandoor smoked bacon was interesting, but cooked a little too long in my opinion.  Eggs and potatoes matched my expectations - also a little better than the typical diner.    They also serve cocktails and \"adult\" milkshakes, which is a nice addition to the menu.  Also, everything looks very new, shiny, and clean.  Wish there was a way to signal from the outside that this place is more than your typical diner."}
{"text":"Such an awesome atmosphere. Walking up to this place is awesome and a flash back in time.   We walked in and were seated immediately. They didn't have an open tables so we opted for the bar.   The waitress was super awesome and after explaining some drink options, I went with a lemon-lime rickey (soda water and lemon like flavoring) super delicious and refreshing!!! My gf went with a black cherry float and it was so so good.   For apps; I got the creamy chicken soup. This is a must try. It's kind of like a chicken howler with kale, herbs, chicken, and croutons. The gf got the black swamp Gouda Mac n cheese. Super super good. Creamy in the middle and crunchy on the top.   Main course.  I got the Katz club. AMAZING. double decker sandwich with an egg. And the fries are made to perfection and sprinkled with some herbs.  The gf got the vegan patty as a cheeseburger. So good. It came with Carmelized onions and an Indian inspired sauce. Super delish.   They have awesome vegetarian and vegan options and their breakfast menu looked amazing.   The pastry counter was stocked with amazing treats. And they have a full selection of teas and coffee.   Really recommend this place. Awesome atmosphere and awesome food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in both the diner cart and the drink cart are top notch. The food wasn't as impressive as I was hoping it to be, but I was still pleased and need to go back for the breakfast to really figure this place out.   The veggie burger has an indian flavor to it that I wasn't expecting. Isn't bad, but just wasn't expecting it. The ginger rum milkshake was okay, but I'd get something more traditional next time. The guyere mac & cheese was my fave thing I tried."}
{"text":"Finally! We have been looking for a breakfast option for Sunday Mornings in the Hts area. TavCo has tasty brunch and the other brunch options are also great. But we are thrilled to have an option that opens before 9.   But the timing is not the best thing about Katz! The food is really delicious - it raises the quality of the classic diner food. While offering the traditional items - everything down to the honey and the jam tastes like it is fresh off the farm. The hash browns were crisp and fluffy. The eggs were cooked perfectly - the juice tasted fresh squeezed. Also - Chef Katz brought out our meals (nice touch!). We are so excited to go back! I am also looking forward to trying some of the tasty baked goods that were out on the counter."}
{"text":"cleveland heights chic diamonds in a dining car comfortable chairs.  Stopped in for lunch yesterday and was very, VERY impressed by the menu and the space itself. Being that it had just opened, some menu items were understandably  unavailable, but all in all, I was well pleased with what we had.   Clam chowder was chock full of tender clams. Garnished with crumbled bacon which was not too bacony or tasty actually. The liquid itself was tasty, but not very clammy or seafoody.  The \"Katz Club\" sandwich had the twist of an egg in it and was quite good. Excellent bread that was buttered and toasted.  Yum. But again, the bacon was kinda meh... Stuffed cabage was solid, as was the mac n' cheese. Everybody has a personal preference to this type of comfort food.  Latkas were eggy but still crispy.   Loved the take on noodle kugel, but wish it had one more note of flavor. Desserts were very good as well. The \"Ho-Ho\" is the bomb. I loved the Boston Cream Pie although my GF would have preferred a more custard to cake ratio. I really look forward to returning. This place shows a lot of promise. Our server could not have been more gracious and sincere.  Oh yeah, the bar car is a stunner! Can't wait to try it!  Carry on...."}
{"text":"Pretentious as F.  Do not let the word \"diner\" in the name or the fact that its in an older diner confuse you.  This is not a place you go for simple and filling food.  There must be 30+ different (non-alcoholic) drinks on the menu and like 10 food items.  I had the club sandwich as it seemed like a safe bet, but the only good thing on it was the bacon.  Way too much money for what you get.  If you're meeting up with a bunch of your friends from Tumblr and you want to post pics of said meeting on FB, this is the place.  If you actually want a meal, go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I am reviewing two of the sandwich boxes that one may order when going to a Cain Park event. First, these boxes are large!  We had one smoked chicken sandwich box and one veggie box.  Each box also had a large bag of plain sea-salted potato chips, utensils, napkin and a small triangle of a brownie for a dessert. I chose the veggie sandwich, which had avocado, cheese, peppers and sauce along with lettuce and tomato.  This sandwich was very good, large, and cut into two.  Just know that it's spicy.  I couldn't eat more than a quarter of it before surrendering it to others. So, be aware it's spicy! I also tried the smoked chicken sandwich, with cheese, lettuce and sauce on wheat.  This was very, very good.  Also, not spicy; however it did possess a lot of flavor.  It came with the same chips and dessert as the veggie box.   The triangle of brownie was decadent.  It was a fudge-y, incredibly sweet treat. Now, these two boxes would have been approaching thirty bucks...and without a drink, I don't think they warrant that much money.  However, it does beat what is offered at Cain Park ($3 waters, anyone?).  Having put this into perspective: they are comparably priced.   Also wish the brownie was a full square, as it  still would have been small."}
{"text":"Based on the good reviews, we decided to give the new iteration of the Cleveland Heights diner car a try. I was hopeful when we walked in - the place is spotless with a great atmosphere. I like that the dining area is small but not too much so. The counter seats are comfortable and the counter itself isn't super-narrow as in most diner cars.   The latte I had was tasty but tasted much more café au lait than latte. Still good though so things are still going well. The pastries up front at the coffee counter, although we didn't try them, looked amazing. The service too, was prompt and friendly.   The wheels really came off, though, when the food arrived. I love me a good breakfast, and a breakfast-all-day diner car done well is just one of the finer things in life. Sadly, this place just didn't measure up.  Sean had the burger with fries - very average with not much flavor. Fries were that which you can get anywhere. Absolutely nothing special in any way - and for $11, that sucks.   My meal was borderline awful. I had the 2 egg plate which comes with choice of potato (homefries or hash browns) and choice of toast (white wheat rye or english muffin). I went with hash browns and english muffin. The base price was $6. I also got a side of 'house made bacon' for an extra $3. Steep but usually with the assertion of 'house made', this is going to be some damn good bacon.   First,  I am stupified with what passes as an english muffin at this place. I can only describe it as bland white bread in a circle shape. No flavor whatsoever.   The bacon was an absolute tragedy. Why you would ruin what was clearly once thick, yummy bacon by cooking it to a completely charred mess, I simply can't understand. One piece was edible and was relatively chewy and good. The other two were just a crumbly, tasteless mess. So one piece of edible bacon for $3.   The hash browns were served as two congealed circular patties - really they looked more like potato pancakes - which are yummy too so ok - except these were so saturated in grease as to be completely rubbery and nasty.   The only fully edible thing on the plate was the eggs which were actually cooked over-medium as ordered. But for $9 I left wanting more to eat and that is just not ok.   Perhaps the other menu items are better, but as we are barely ever in CH anyway, I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for upgraded diner fare, then look no further.  As a Heights resident, I've been waiting for these box cars to finally have a thriving restaurant and I think the Katz Club Diner is just that.  Family came in around 1pm, no waiting and sat at the counter.  Waitress was a little timid, but attentive and polite.  Ordered and cappuccino that was perfectly made, thick and creamy, my family had milkshakes that they said were delicious.  I had the 3 egg omelette breakfast, eggs were buttery, toast was fresh and delicious, the strawberry jam made in-house was spectacular!!!  Hubby had the Reuben with fries which he said was delicious and filling.  Son had the cold meatloaf sandwich which was also delicious and portioned generously.   Only (sort of) complaint would be the long wait time for food and drinks.  Once they arrived though, it was well worth the wait.    This place is a winner!  Go there, NOW!    Eat local and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I really want to love and support this place, but it is a mixed bag here. Food, location, and ambience are great, but it is the lackluster service that is standing in the way of me ever returning.  As another reviewer mentioned, the service is best described as \"aloof\".  The first time I was there during the middle of the afternoon on a slow weekday, our server was noticibly absent during our meal and food was super slow to come out.  That in itself would not stop me from coming back.  Rather it was my experience during a busy Sunday brunch time that will make me think really hard about returning.  My husband and I walk in and the hostess tells us the wait times.  We tell her our seating preference and the number in our party, she writes it down, and then we sit on the steps outside as it is standing room only in the inside.  25 minutes later, I go and check on the wait.   The hostess decided that since we walked out, that she would cross out our reservation.  I calmly explain what happened and show where our reservation was on the paper.  The hostess recognizes what she did, doesnt apologize, but claims they will seat us ASAP.  We wait another 10 minutes inside, when they proceed to seat 3 couples that were on the list well after us.   After this, I tell the hostess why I am leaving.  She lies and tells me that they are customers with phone reservations.  I calmlj tell her that they were not, because I watched them walk in, check the wait, and give their name, and wait like the rest of us.  Phone reservations were seated right away.  Her response was nothing, no apologies, no nothing.    Mistakes happen, I get that.  But when they do, you apologize and fix it.  Not here.  The place isn't that great to deal with the haughty and/or aloof hosts and severs."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our brunch here, was surprised by the quality and that it was not a dive. Nice place with reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"This review is in response to Greg N. First off, when you go to a breakfast joint on a Sunday during brunch hours, of course you can expect a wait, louder than average surroundings and slower service. It would be dumb to think otherwise. As for price... you pay for quality. If you don't like it, dont come back.  As for my experience, I love every second of it. The food is absolutely amazing, the staff is attentive and very friendly. I loved the entire experience from beginning to end. I highly recommend the meatloaf. It's to die for. I'm perplexed by Greg's review because it seems all his complaints stem from not wanting to wait for or pay what the food is worth. I had a completely different experience and I would and already have recommended Katz to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Disappointing!  My wife had a bowl of chicken noodle soup and I had the regular chili.  The chicken soup had a brown colored broth and was tasteless.  My wife had to send it back to have some noodles and veggies added to the $6.00 bowl of brown broth!  MY chili wAs no better.  It was super thick and super spicy, almost too uncomfortable to eat.  The texture was that of something that was cooked two weeks ago!  We ordered the soup and chili because the food coming out of the kitchen was large portions and neither of us are big eaters.  There were no small plates or soup, salad, sandwich combos on the menu. They did not offer a luncheon menu.  I would like to have ordered the fried chicken entree, but at 18.$ this would have been a pricey lunch and I wasn't near going home for the day so a doggy bag was out of  the equation. We might try it again in the future if we're in the area"}
{"text":"Do I love diners? Why yes, I LOVE diners. Do I love the Katz Club Diner? YES YES YES!  I've always been a sucker for diners. My favorite memories in college is sitting in a local diner, getting my eggs, toast, and sausage with weak coffee for a price tag of $5. Sure, the inside of diners were always dingy and ugly, but hey, it's comforting. Take a step up- Coney Islands. Oh, how I miss the Coney Islands of Michigan. Sigh. Nevertheless, when I stepped into the Katz Club Diner, I felt a sigh of relief. Yes, here was my diner...but a fancier one than what I have had in the past.  The Katz Club Diner is pretty cool- from the guy who owns Fire, it's a half diner restaurant car, and a half speakeasy car. You want good food? Go to the left. You want a speakeasy lounge? Go to the side door on the side of the car.  Went here on two occasions: For dinner: - He got the chicken and waffles- oh man, that was a great tasting waffle and great chicken. It's not your typical fried chicken with waffle- it's more of a light fluffy waffle with almost a stir fry dark meat chicken on top..with some type of gravy. Nonetheless, that was the win of the night. - I got the monte cristo sandwich. It was good...and BIG. The sizes they give you....are quite hefty. Nonetheless, it was good.  For breakfast: - WIN: They serve Rising Star coffee! I've taken a step up from the weak watery coffee that I'm used to in the diners I used to frequent. - He got an omelette. It was good and solid. - I got the corned beef hash. Whew- that was one heavy corn hash. It was good though! Picture thick cuts of corned beef... Mmmmmm. Good stuff. With a side of toast. Mmmm.  You'll be definitely full here. But the wait staff is great and knowledgeable, and they serve great food with even a pastry window near the entrance as well. But you know what I love most about it? The FEEL of a diner. What makes it authentic? When old couples come in to eat breakfast together. When old men sit by themselves, eating their breakfast and reading their newspaper. Where the locals frequent. That's a diner for ya. Sure, it's a fancy diner, but hey, it's a diner, and I like it. Check it out when you get a chance."}
{"text":"Fun place with good service and some vegetarian options: eggplant reuben (I tried it and wished for more sauerkraut but otherwise good--I just added salt), vegetarian chili (albeit with mushrooms--not my thing), vegetarian hot dogs, and a couple other things, including omelets any time of day. Vegans have fewer options--I haven't yet inquired about the protein in the hotdogs or chili, but I'm sure cheese can be deleted and there are some salads to choose from. They also have a sort of cafe area, with coffee, baked goods and great-looking desserts, although seating in that section is limited to a few stools at the window.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to have a drink at the cocktail car on Saturday night and they have done a fantastic job with the decor.  Velvet curtains, dim lighting, tufted leather.  Perfect.  The call box at the door is a little off-putting - though, I can see how it may be necessary given the small space and the intimate vibe they are trying to keep.  The drinks, as of now, are nothing exciting.  WIne, beer, manhattans and martinis.  They are all well-crafted, but I feel like if you are going out of your way to establish a \"speakeasy\" type atmosphere there either need to be more classics to choose from or more original cocktails on the menu.  It was the first week of business, so maybe that will be coming in the future.  The crowd seemed to be mostly regulars from Mr. Katz other restaurants and were more concerned with making their appearance and making sure the owner knew they were there than having a nice evening.  I am hoping the longer they are open, the more they will get people in who are there to truly enjoy the atmosphere and a great drink.  We will definitely be back, but I am hoping for some expansion/improvement on the cocktail menu!"}
{"text":"It is great to see more development on Lee Rd north of Cedar. Douglas Katz is well known on the Cleveland food scene. I was curious to try out the revamped diner for a nice weekend breakfast. The west side has John's Diner which is another diner car, old school place. However, my father warned me against trying John's since 1984. Katz Club seems to have a lot of class for a simple diner. The Katz Club can certainly compete with the Inn on Coventry and Luna. It is a nice, bright and cheery place to eat. I imagine a nighttime experience would be on the opposite end of the emotional eating spectrum than my pre-noon visit. Early morning vs after dark dining feel so different from each other. The cosmic energy fields are both fascinating and appeal to me more than the 6 pm in between time. The basic eggs breakfast I had was outstanding. The corned beef hash was enjoyable. I like going to diners for nostalgia and it reminds me that I am existing in America in the eternal moment. The space age diner car is a vessel of intergalactic travel when one opens their pineal gland.   \"Silver Machine\" by Hawkwind  I, I just took a ride In a silver machine And I'm still feeling mean Do you wanna ride?

{"text":"truly inattentive service. 11:30 seated. Diner was at most 15% full. 10 minutes later and no server had even stopped by the table. Too busy socializing. We'll not be back."}
{"text":"My bf is rarely excited about traditional american breakfast foods.  So I was suprised when he kept going on and on about the breakfast here, so we went to give it a try.  I started off with an almond latte.  I asked for soy, but they only carry almond milk as a dairy alternative.  So almond milk it was.  It tasted fine... but I was a little disappointed.  He got the katz club sandwich.  It was yummy.  Very large portion -- easily big enough for both of us.  I usually get clubs at diners and he was being nice, because I wanted to order the eggs that he couldn't stop raving about.  The club also came with fries that were delicious.  I got the Shortrib Chilaquiles.   It's a soft scrambled egg served over short ribs, black beans, tortillas, salsa verde, pickled peppers, & cheese.  Maybe he just had my expectations hyped up too much with how much he loved it.  But I was a little disappointed.  It was much heavier than I wanted it to be for breakfast.  The short rib was deliciously cooked, the eggs were a little over done.  It's a very cute place, the staff are very nice, but the prices are little higher than most diners.  But the food is pretty good, and they serve rising star coffee -- if only they would carry some soy milk. ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"Cool little diner, while there U felt like I was cruising inside the Coors Light train. Awesome interior. Theres a cool little personal room, maybe for Mafia Dons??   I ordered the Corn Beef Hash. It was a good portion, however the tag was12$, but worth it. When they first brought it, I had multi-grain toast and just finished dressing my meal with all the essential condiments when our waitress came and took it. It was someone else's apparently.   Sitting there now mouth watering, I patiently waited for my CBH, it took away from the expectations I had. It was still very good, dont get me wrong.   The experience of diners is a special one, cozy would explain it best. This one doesn't slack in that area."}
{"text":"Since our first trip to Katz Club, we made no fewer than 4 additional visits with family and friends. The food is consistently good - especially at its price point - and we always have a lovely time. We were so saddened by the recent fire that has closed the Katz Club for the time being. I hope very much that Chef Katz and his team know how much the community values their work and are looking forward to the return of the Katz Club! In the meantime, we're just as happy to brunch at Fire, though. :)"}
{"text":"Ok! I got a mushroom burger. It was fine but not worth the price. Their food is just fine. Not sure if I go back for food. Might try it next time for a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"I love this new place - went there three times in about two weeks.  It's great before a show at Cain Park, but also has good breakfasts.  It's open late enough for coffee and a snack after a movie.   The food is interesting and good, and there is a wide variety.  The people are friendly and the setting is cool and fun."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  The first few times, the service was bad, the waitress was incredibly unfriendly and curt.  However, my last few visits were a 180.  Great service and good food.  I recommend the club or the chicken a la king.  The decor is really cool, truly has a modern diner feel.  They serve great coffee and their desserts are incredible."}
