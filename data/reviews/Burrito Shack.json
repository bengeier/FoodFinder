{"text":"Had \"The Shack\" breakfast burrito. Probably the best one I've had in a while. Usually I can't finish the entire thing but it was so darn good I couldn't stop.  The Shack, with a Mtn Dew at 830 in the morning is a good start to a Saturday!  Location is really awesome as well, it truly is a shack. Cool decor and makes you feel like your somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Read all the rave reviews about this place. Finally stopped by to give it a shot. Friendly staff however extremely disappointing food. Ordered the carne asada fries and beef taco. Flavorless...seriously.."}
{"text":"We have lived in the area for over a year and decided to give this a try today for breakfast. Looks can be deceiving!! Great service and fantastic food!! All is made fresh to order and you can see everyone working inside to make the magic happen using fresh ingredients to prepare...all for very reasonable prices. If you are looking for a unique experience and can get past the look from the street (I actually liked the \"worn and authentic\" setting), try this place! You won't be disappointed and will find yourself wanting get to go back for more. It is always super busy for a reason...one of a kind!!"}
{"text":"Delicious burrito for a cheap price. The tortilla and hot salsa were especially good."}
{"text":"Don't think it's bad just by looking at the outside. Seriously some of the best burritos I've ever had! Highly recommend the California burrito. So good!"}
{"text":"Drove by this place & was intrigued but filed it away. Then, minutes later other relatives who had also driven past it mentioned it so we decided to give it a try based on previous reviews. Um, YUM! Between the 8 of us we had quite a sampling of the menu and no one had a single complaint. Carne Asada burrito was the best! Super inexpensive and huge portions! Only 4 stars because it took them 10 mins to give us our drinks and an additional 20 mins before the food was ready. They ran out of chili beef and comped us some chips but it was still a disappointment to those who really wanted it. We will definitely be back the next time we visit the parents!"}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing but all the people who work here are very nice. It may look like a Shack but it's high on quality and service"}
{"text":"For breakfast this morning I had the green chile breakfast burrito and added ham. Perfect!  I love this place."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite fast food Mexican restaurant. Tried carne asada, quesadilla, and machaca all great. Hot salsa is great with a little kick. Mild is ok, but a little watery for my taste. This is a must try!"}
{"text":"Best. Burritos. Ever. I waited so long to try this place, quickly dismissing it due to the outside exterior. Don't be a fool like me! Go in and find joy, topped with their excellent salsa."}
{"text":"Carne asada, Cali burrito was great. Not sure what small is, but the Shack size was huge. Connie's Favorite was lacking flavor, but it was very juicy. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Based on the appearance of the aptly named Burrito \"Shack\" I had low expectations.  I figured anything better than salmonella or the need for a tetanus shot  was a win.    Wow was I pleasantly surprised.  Now I have been there maybe ten times and it has been fantastic every time.  Great food, great price, huge portions, and they are fast and friendly.  I have had a few different items and nothing has disappointed.    If you are not on the Burrito Shack bandwagon you are missing out!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. I make the trip out there all the time! Steak and potato plus sour cream is my jam! Lol all fresh and yummy"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch. I had my doubts from judging the outside of it, but it's probably the best place I've ever ate at in Arizona. Wonderful food. Authentic and so flavorful. I will be going back for more the next time I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"You've probably seen this place a lot if you drive on Power Rd at all and always wondered if it was legit (given the sign streetside usually always says open).  I was one of those folks as well.  It's changed ownership a few times is what the local story has it, but the current owners are kind folks who are cranking out burritos, grande style.  I've been there a few times opting for the carne asada/potato, chorizo/egg/bean burrito options  Chorizo for me is a benchmark.  Burrito Shack didn't blow me away with the chorizo offering, it was good, but not great.  Return visits will have me sticking with a variation including carne asada.  The burritos are large...you can split one with someone if you want.  I'm not sure why restaurants feel the need to wrap everything in a 36-inch tortilla, but the Shack is no different.  Just prepare yourself.  Cut it in half to start to save the rest for later...unless you are muy hungry.  The name states the ambience.  It's a shack.  That covered stuff you see -- it's like the covered parking in a medical parking lot...not enclosed.  If it's cold outside, the Shack will be cold because, well, you're outside.  There is no 'inside' dining.  This is fine by me and I love the 'get your food and find a chair that isn't broken' type places.  So stop passing the sign by, pull in and grab some burrito."}
{"text":"The service was great And the place overall has a great aura. The salsa and chips are my favorite! I recommend the chorizo con papas burrito.. they aren't chincy with the chorizo either!"}
{"text":"The Burrito Shack will not disappoint you. Don't let the exterior fool you. I live in the area and pass the Shack on a daily basis. Seamed to be closed until I learned their hours of operation,  6:30 - 2. The burritos are all ways freshly made and the staff as cheerful as can be. Always a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Numerous choices all fantastic. Friendly staff.  Amazing quality at an affordable price.  Hidden gem of Gilbert.  For breakfast I recommend the country and for lunch I recommend Connie's Favorite."}
{"text":"A friend of mine will occasionally bring burritos from this place to work, so I've nibbled on their food occasionally.  I wasn't overfond of their bean burrito, but their 6 Pound Burrito, served enchilada style? -Yum- and I'm not even all that fond of green chille.  As Matt S. said, it's literally a shack. But who cares? They've got really good burritos."}
{"text":"Every time I visit, I come here. This my favorite burrito place and that says A LOT since I live in San Diego, the capital of Mexican food in America"}
{"text":"Ok so we always go by here and say that we are going to stop by and try it.. So today we drove by and it was OPEN :o) and let me tell YOU it was GOOD!!! Really Good!!! The place looks like it's about to fall over.. But it's cool.. I will be going there Again for sure... The only bad thing about this place is that they close at 5 M-F so I will not b able to eat there during the week. So I will have to wake up early on Saturdays... They are also closed on Sundays :o( but aside from the HRs... The food is GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Gotta keep it 100.. really poor chorizo breakfast burrito. Drove by this place 100 times and never went in because of the horrible curb appeal. Saw all the good reviews so I thought it's worth a try. Not so good. Good Chorizo, microwave eggs, potatoes that were cut up French fries, and a transparently thin flour tortilla. I gave it two stars instead of 1 because the staff was friendly and the price was good. But would have gladly paid more for real eggs, potatoes, and tortilla. It was equivalent to a Carl's Jr. or Taco Bell attempt at breakfast Burritos."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, the beans are full of flavor, the meat is tender and succulent, plus if you go to A.S.U its only a 10 minute walk away so whenever you hungry just walk your self over and your guaranteed the best burrito!"}
{"text":"Delicious burritos and friendly staff!  My favorite is the California burrito with green chile sauce inside.  I wish they were open later!"}
{"text":"Completely overrated. Everyone talks about how amazing the food is and I'll give it to them, the quality of food is good. But FLAVOR is an integral part of food being delicious.  Everything but the green chili pork is devoid of flavor. The carne asada isn't marinated making it especially tough and unenjoyable, the hot sauce has a weak flavor, and  the larger lady at the window is rude. Season your food people!"}
{"text":"Love this little Mexican burrito shack! The carnesada is good! I love the beans and rice too!"}
{"text":"Although this place looks like something from a shanty town, don't let that scare you because the place is sanitary and serves great mexican food. It's decently priced and I haven't had anything I don't like. Everything is home-made as far as I can see and tastes delicious. Just make sure you remember the hours since they're a little odd. I love their green chile pork and potato burrito. Large servings fill you up so you could even split a burro if you don't eat a lot. I would put aside any prejudice from the look and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Best burrito I've found in the valley.  we went during the week and ordered a chimi & California burrito to split.  The burrito was amazing and the steak was tender and very flavorful.  The chicken chimi was decent but I preferred the steak by a landslide.    The inside is mixed matched table & chairs and is like eating outside.  Don't let this bother you b/c the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Not authentic Mexican food or taste.  Lack of seasoning on the meats.  FLAVORLESS . Even Taco Bell tastes better. Cute place. Wont repeat."}
{"text":"Only order the lunch menue. Breakfast is not quite as good. Great Pork. Bring your friends, you will be thanked..."}
{"text":"Great customer service and a cheap price ($7 for a carne asada burrito w/small drink) but the food was overall decent at best and not nearly as authentic as I hoped it would be. If you are looking for some authentic Mexican food, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior appearance deter you. This place has OUTSTANDING Mexican fare. It rivals Elmer's in Chandler. Skip the chains and give this place  try. Funny enough, it appears to be run by Americans."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Probably because of the location: about two miles from my house, the owners: just friendly good people, the clientele: construction workers, crusty old guys, I'm not sure I've ever seen another woman there now that I think of it...They make a big, inexpensive, good burrito. My oldest boys loves the breakfast burrito with potatoes and bacon. And I mean bacon. Real, huge, chunks of delicious bacon. Man bacon. It's delicious. Not that I've ever gotten one of these because women have no business eating huge, bacon burritos right? Yeah. That's it. Never.  On to girly food: green chile pork is delish. My younger boys always loves the bean & cheese.  And it's awesome on the way to the lake in the morning.  Did I mention it really is a shack?? Really Really."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service have had both the Cali burro and the works breakfast soo good! Could visit daily if I had the time/budget."}
{"text":"My waistline doesn't want to admit it, but I am a regular here, coming in about once every week to two weeks. I love the Colorado red chili, the green chili pork, the carne asada, their hot salsa, Cali burrito....really, the list goes on and on. The burritos are huge and really reasonably-priced. Everyone that works here is super friendly and most days when I pick up my order, someone is sitting there chopping away at delicious fresh onions, tomatoes, peppers for the various dishes. They have a very extensive menu and I really need to try some of the tacos and other items but the burritos are just so darn good! Their patio is covered and not very large but we usually just order ours for pick up and eat at home. I have never been there when there wasn't some form of line but the wait isn't all that long for the food.   They have free wi-fi, amazing, quality ingredients, they don't skimp on the meat and fillings in the burritos, either. I will definitely keep coming here."}
{"text":"I have been talking this place up to my wife for months! Finally had a chance on my day off to get some lunch for us there today..... and it was damn good! Best burritos in town. My wife loved her California Burrito and my green chili pork was awesome! Those things are monsters and the price is so incredibly good! I will be returning often, with my family and friends!"}
{"text":"Service was ok, not the best burrito. I had the bacon burrito and also tried chorizo and egg burrito. Honestly don't think I will be going back. When my food was ready the guy at the window said here you go \"babe\"  kinda not what I was expecting .. but anyway the food was meh and the service meh. I put two stars because it wasn't horrible food just not great, I only ate half and didn't care for it anymore. But also a star because of the way the building was, I thought it was pretty neat how they had it set up, unique and went with the name \"shack\" just wished the experience would have been better."}
{"text":"Lived here for 8 years and finally went to the Burrito Shack! The hours are limited, closing at 2:30 so I've never been able to make it in until today. I am bummed that I didn't try it sooner! Very good! Affordable and quality. We got the egg and ham burritos. Good sized burritos. We will be back."}
{"text":"The service was great, the workers were super nice but the California burrito I ordered wasn't the best. The meat was dry and the potatoes were undercooked. I paid about $6.50 but in the future I plan on getting burritos from Los or filabirtos"}
{"text":"I got the Gilbert, wife got the Egg and Green Chile. Smalls were perfect for a quick lunch. Hot sauce isn't that hot."}
{"text":"Place is a joke. All you see is people waiting and inquiring about when their order is coming out. About 10 people and believe me, this was not rush hour for lunch either. Was late going back to work. Never again. Kitchen def needs to hustle instead of taking there sweet time. It's a shack not a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious burritos. It looks gross and shacky from outside so I'm always surprised to see that it's clean inside. And even when it's 110 out it somehow stays relatively cool without having air conditioning. I'm a fan of the California Burrito. The salsa doesn't have much flavor but the burrito has enough that it doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for lunch today!  Had the carne asada burrito with no beans and it was one of the best burritos I've had in a while.  The hot salsa was also very good and the carne asada was seasoned so well.... Don't let the outside deter you.  Great food and friendly service!  Can't wait to go back and try something else in the menu!!!"}
{"text":"What a kewl fun place. The food is good and the shack is fun. Great place for a nice lunch. The queso was good and quesadilla was great! I liked this place."}
{"text":"Look below for the Kelly H. review.  She's an idiot.  This place is a great value for the money and the service was excellent.  Kelly H. needs to stick with Taco Bell."}
{"text":"If I could have only gotten past the fact that this place is truly in a shack - I'd have been OK. The food was awesome - but I just couldn't believe that it could look the way it does and meet all food safety and building codes. Oh well - I enjoyed and I might visit again. But how hot does that place get in the summer? Servings of guac were too small and not completely filled up in the little tiny containers. But the crispy rolled tacos were amazing."}
{"text":"Great place, great people, great food, just trust me. I tried the California Burrito and was great .."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! To bad the hours kinda suck, but Rita's and this place are the best I've had in the metro area."}
{"text":"Nothing to rave about.  It was good,not great.  Lacks meat portion in burritos. It's a little hole in the wall place. Indoor and outdoor seating.  Not open all day."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service! We order out from here for work all the time- tacos are awesome!!! And the chips and salsa are so good!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite burrito place. I try to limit my visits here to once per week, but usually end up coming twice (and wanting it much more). Their breakfast burritos are phenomenal. My favorite order is a Connie's Favorite with carne asada instead of chicken. Food is always done quickly and staff is always nice. I recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Quiet location with great fresh food.   The nice girl suggested the breakfast burrito with green chillis. I added chicken. Delicious.  I chose the mild salsa. Not overpowering with a light taste.   All in all a great bfast-ritto that I would suggest to anyone."}
{"text":"Ok, starting my rating before I start eating. My friend ate here 10 years ago when he got out of the military and he couldn't wait to come back. This kind of memory you can't ignore. When you pull up you can't imagine the building survives a strong breeze. The food must be amazing. The line was long but we got through quickly and we are sitting on the rock patio with sheet metal roof above us. Open air. I can't imagine this place in the summer.   Heading outside to eat as the burritos came very quickly.   Amazing Carne Assad burrito. Ooooooh. It didn't sing like the other guy said but I'm tone deaf. Amazing burrito. Nearly rivals my favorite spot in Reno (Speedy Burrito). You gotta stop. If you like open air places, this is a must stop spot. I'm not a fan of the heat so go in the winter or early spring. It's a bit warm here right now."}
{"text":"Crap in a tortilla, if that's what you're looking for then you found your place!  It's sad that crappy attitudes and rude comments of the Kitchen staff have to take away from a place that has a bit of character and a home town local spot feel.  That home town feeling is when you walk to the window and the lady taking your order says hey I should of known your name, how are you?  Sorry but today was my last visit!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos!! Wow!!! So moist and juicy. I will be back for sure! Make sure you bring your own napkins and clean your table but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time and the food was great. The burrito I got was the Gilbert and it was so good. Also the horchata was delicious. I plan on coming back here with friends and family."}
{"text":"The food is not excellent but it is good for a reasonable price. I personally like the atmosphere but it's probably not for everyone. I always get the green chili pork burrito and it never disappoint. Giving it a 4 star for consistency in quality."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get a burrito around here, a favorite spot of mine.  Cheap but delicious, can't beat it.  Sure you may be eating it in a shack, but if you wanted an upscale ambiance than why would you go to a place with \"shack\" in the name?"}
{"text":"We were told this was a local favorite so we stopped for some mexican eats. We ordered carne asada enchiladas, a crispy chicken taco, mild salsa and chips and the California burrito. The food was lacking flavor and very bland. We were less than impressed. . ."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. Got a bacon breakfast burrito, added ham. Good burrito, but it wasn't that hot. Given, we drove over somewhere else to eat them, so they may have lost their temp on the way over, but if they were hot to begin with, the cheese would have melted, which it didn't. No big deal, still not a bad burrito. Nothing to write home about, though. I definitely want to try it again, eat it right away and give it another chance.  Not really blown away like other reviewers were."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and it's very good but today I decided to get crisp tacos, bad decision, greasy and not tastey, all got a burrito for my friend and it was his first time having one from here and he loved it, and I've had the burritos myself and also very good, so lesson learned stay with a burrito, lol"}
{"text":"4 stars for very small things, but the good things first... Customer service is A+++ and the lady at the order window was very helpful with our first visit. The breakfast burritos were awesome and very affordable. My son had a small bacon burrito and still couldn't finish it. My wife and I had shack size Country burrito and The Works and they were very very good. Knocked off one star for the number of flies in the eating area (minor nuisance) and that the burritos were not wrapped well and opened at one end while eating them. Overall very good experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"Very good!! Have been there 3 times in 2 weeks for their breakfast burritos!! Great place and friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"Great place for an amazing breakfast burritos. My family and I went and loved everything we bought."}
{"text":"DO IT!  Put aside any reservations you may have about this little shack and go ahead and give it a shot.  It's a super cute place and it seems like it may be family run and has a very friendly vibe.  I went here after urgings from my friends and I'm so glad I did!   Today is Cinco de Mayo and one of their specials was Cinnamon crisps with fruit salsa and dip (they sold me with a free sample).  DEEELISH!! Seriously, my hungover husband couldn't eat much, but he sure was able to scarf this down.  The fruit salsa is like pureed strawberries and other fruit and it was perfection.  My husband said he could have drank it, it was that good.  I'm glad we gave it a shot since I don't think it's regularly on the menu, but maybe we can petition for it to be a permanent menu addition... I had a carne asada burrito, the carne is good chunks of tasty meat and the tortilla was great.  My husband got the carne asada fries which were pretty basic but not as exciting as the ones he used to always get in LA with his buddies.  All in all, I'll definitely be back, and I actually want to eat there instead of doing take out... at least before it gets too hot.  The ambiance is really cute and laid back.  I'll be back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Operative words for this place are cheap and tasty. Get anything with carne asada. It is actually in a shack, so don't expect too much ambiance other than large wooden tables full of construction workers and college students from down the road. I would suggest calling your order in ahead as the line at lunch can get long."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite place to eat on the weekends. We take all of our visiting friends and family here when they come to town. It is generally the first place they want to eat when they come. The salsa is amazing, and the portion sizes are very generous for the price. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Literally is a shack but man it's a cute spot and amazing food! $5 for a big burrito ! I recommend the carne asada burrito enchilada style with the green sauce! Spicy and tasty!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Everything hand made and fresh. I eat here multiple times a week and have yet to have it disappoint."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. Their rustic exterior contains excellent service and great burritos (I had the green chile & pork breakfast burrito). Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu. Don't miss this place when you're in the east valley."}
{"text":"Took advice of the Yelp superstars and called in our order at about 12:45 on a Friday. Our California burrito, small 4 oz. chips/salsa and taco salad were ready within 15-20 min, waiting for me when I arrived and cost a little over $16. The young gal on the phone was unfriendly but the woman at the pick-up counter was incredibly welcoming and sweet. As for the food, if I could give 3.5, I would! While I it seemed like everything was fresh and homemade (which is awesome!), the food lacked flavor. We liked, but didn't loved our meal because of the lacking flavors.   The tortilla chips were good and the mild salsa was a bit watery and the onions and tomatoes very finely chopped. The cilantro left a good taste for an otherwise average salsa. The hot salsa with the burrito was more of a sauce and we didn't find it to be any hotter than the mild(and I am super sensitive to spice). The carne asada was well cooked and did not have any gristle. With a bit of salt/pepper or simmering in salsa, it would be amazing! The tortilla was good, as was the guac, although I wish that the fries on the Cali were more crispy and the cheese melted. I may request crisp fies if I try it again. Hubby felt the same way about his taco salad, that his meat (shredded chicken) lacked flavor. It would be nice if they put beans and a salad dressing in the salad as well.   Overall, we would try again but order different items. The fresh and homemade items definitely warrant a second try!"}
{"text":"Went back to this location to give it another chance and I was beyond blown away of how delicious the breakfast burrito aka known as \"the works\" was. I most definitely will become a regular customer. I was also impress on how the owner made sure we were taken care of when we went today. Mmmmmm good!!! =-P"}
{"text":"Love coming here when I'm on the east side of the valley or on a weekend. If you love burritos be sure to swing by here and check this place out. The California and the Green Chile Pork are my two favorites and I'm hoping to check out more of their selection. I usually call ahead my orders just in case. I've never been disappointed coming here. By far the best burrito in Mesa hands down."}
{"text":"What can I say about the Burrito Shack, the food was very good unfortunately two of my three items were were incorrect. Cheese enchilada red sauce, Got green sauce. Still taste good. Breakfast quesadilla with bacon, got a breakfast burrito instead, still tasted good but wrong. Really would have preferred a quesadilla as I ordered over the burrito."}
{"text":"Well, not bad really. Healthy sized burrito. I had the carne asada. Meat wasn't the best, a tiny on the chewy side but not bad. Good meal really, you won't be hungry after one of these.   They were not too busy but I still waited what felt like a longer than normal time to get my order, maybe 8  to 10 minutes. Staff taking the order was efficient but a little abrupt. I don't mind that much really, a place like this is about the food not the social skills of the staff.   All in all I'd say this place is worth an occasional visit. Very casual. It really is a shack."}
{"text":"almost afraid to post this review...... keeps getting busier every time I go!  my wife said i was crazy for going here as it looks like a place you should not touch with a 10' pole but the burritos are the best!  She now gets cravings every weekend for her Green Chili Pork con Papas !"}
{"text":"This is always one of our first stops when we're in town. Our favorite is The California and Green Chile Pork, but we've tried other options too and the food is always on point. Staff is always very friendly. My only tiny complaint is that the salsa could be spicier, but it's still flavorful and yummy."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine told me about this spot years ago and I FINALLY got a chance to try it! The Burrito shack DOES NOT DISAPPOINT!! Great food, I mean GREAT FOOD! really reasonable prices and a fun feel!! This is our new Saturday spot!!!"}
{"text":"My husband was raving about this place and I was thinking this place was sketch but I was WRONG. We went fir breakfast and my husband got The Works and since it was my first time, I wanted to try a burrito that didn't have eggs, haha. So, I got The California and it was bomb.com. I did get chicken in it instead of the carne asada. I would definitely come back here. Out burritos were hot, fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I have visited the burrito shack twice, both for lunch. Both times it was quit busy but I was able to order and get my food in a relatively quick amount of time. I got the steak California burrito, and wow, the flavor, texture, smell, everything is just spot on. It is quickly becoming my favorite burrito shop. I live in the area and I might be in trouble for how often I crave this place already. I highly suggest you check this place out, don't let the hole in the wall uhhh dirt parking lot, throw you off. The food is amazing and the staff is super friendly. Keep it up burrito shack!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is awesome! I usually get the Country breakfast burrito. It has gravy & is pretty amazing!   The place is nothing to look at. I never actually stay and eat. I just order and go. To make it faster just call ahead to order.   The burritos come in smaller or shack size. I always get smaller and can never finish the whole thing. They are quite a good size for being smaller. The prices are really good, too. I usually get the hot & mild sauce with my burrito because I can't get enough. The hot doesn't have heat (it takes A LOT for me) but it's pretty good.   If you want something delicious for cheap & you're ok if the place isn't fancy then I recommend the shack."}
{"text":"Another solid choice on my way over to check out the ASU Polytechnic campus. The food is very cheap and the servings are huge. The food was mmmmmm mmmmmmm good as the hillbilly burrito loving inner self would say. There is not air conditioning at this place so be prepared, but the shack drops the temp about ten degrees."}
{"text":"I use to love going here...but...Last two times I've ordered steak and potato and it had raw onions not grilled, and potatoes were just dry potatoes wedges.  Raw dumped in onions."}
{"text":"Started off my morning pretty late was craving a breakfast burrito. Burrito Shack was everything I expected and more fast and friendly service!  Went closer to closing time, had the green chili egg burrito the eggs were incredibly fluffy and not burn. Definitely willing to come back to try other things on the menu"}
{"text":"The only bad thing about this place is not knowing what to order because everything is so amazing! I love the breakfast burritos. First timers need to either try \"The Country\" or \"The Shack\". Burrito Shack is my gold standard for burritos, and I take all of my out of town visitors there. They are never disappointed. Everything is super fresh and super delicious! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places when I went to ASU Poly. I drove by it daily 5x a week for a whole semester but never stopped. It was not until my last final I had some time to kill beforehand and I was starving at 9am. Think I got a ham breakfast burrito (ham, potatoes, cheese, onions, tomatoes). It was soo good I scarfed it down, which was a bad idea to stuff myself before my final.   So I didn't return again until the following semester and dropped by almost weekly. These times I pretty just ordered the basic bean and cheese burrito. Just the sheer size for $2 was great, but again added my  free (L, O, and T) and made it taste even better. I didn't mind the setting, free water, and parking because my filling lunch was less than $3 with tax. I liked the owners, the lady was always nice and remembered my order. I do miss this place because my major did get switched to downtown and then graduated. If I didn't live 30 miles away I would definitely be a regular again."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Don't let the idea of shack turn you off, may look run down from the outside but the food and the employees are far from it. All the employees have an excellent energy about them. The red sauce is better then Los'. The California burrito is excellent with juicy freshly cooked steak. Will be back for round two for Connies favorite! Thanks shack."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with anything from the Burrito shack. Normally I am one to find something I like and stick with it. Not here-- I am always finding myself trying something new and enjoying everything I get!  Service is fast and friendly and prices are cheap. I will continue to be back over and over again."}
{"text":"ok, so I worked at the ASU Polytechnic campus for 3 years before trying the Burrito Shack.  Students, faculty, and staff would all rave about it but I refused to eat anything from a shack.  I was so worried about the quality of food.  One adventurous morning, I stopped by for a breakfast burrito.  Oh my goodness!  It was heaven.  I cannot believe that I worked there for 3 years without trying it.  LOVE it!  I was able to get a small egg/cheese/potato burrito with a small coke for about $3.50.  Seriously.  Cheap but delicious.  It is so delicious!  You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Such friendly owners too. I always get the Gilbert breakfast burrito. Soooooo good. I would highly recommend. Don't let the outside appearance fool you. I will always be a loyal customer. Great burritos! I wish they were open on Sundays!"}
{"text":"While the outside looks a little sketchy, it's apparent when you are there that it's very clean and the Shack is part of the name and not really rundown like it appears.   My husband didn't prefer the lightly Coated fries in the California burrito but the meat was pretty good. The carne asada was milder than he is used to but good quality.   I think there was a breakfast burrito called the El Paso with shredded beef. That really hit the spot but could've used more green chilies!  If you're a biscuits and gravy fan, they were pretty good too.   The soft taco shell wasn't cooked enough but the ingredients were good.  Guessing that was a one off situation rather than typical.   All in all, it was good and definitely worth a second trip to find each persons favorite dish."}
{"text":"We loved their chips and salsa, but the burrito's beans had no flavor; we had to add a lot of salt. As for the chicken tacos, they were good but nothing exciting enough for me to have every Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"This review is about Burrito Shack's service. I came in early morning and was first in a long line of customers. The guy who took my order wasn't exactly friendly. Then came the wait of 25 minutes to get one breakfast burrito. There were two persons who came after me but ordered more burritos and both got their orders just after 5 minutes of waiting. Nice job, Burrito Shack. That's a good way to run out of business."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place many times without stopping. This morning I went in for a breakfast burrito and it was outstanding. The sausage was tasty and the salsa was awesome. It's literally a shack, but don't let that fool you. It's a really cool place and I'll be taking my family there for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Authentica!  This place is legit. California burrito was on point. The wait was worth it. Fun place to sit in the sun and enjoy during the winter months. Summer would want to be inside,  but a good place to do a quick stop if you're hungry at the airport."}
{"text":"Closer to a 3-3.5 star but I'm not in the business of penalizing a restaurant where I just am not fond of the food prep. Had the bacon breakfast burro and the works breakfast burro. Overall, the meal was good but not the breakfast burro I was seeking. Bacon was overdone to the point of bacon bits and the sausage was just sparse- a few random chunks. The ham was an after thought at the end. Just like a burro that has all ingredients evenly dispersed and more effort in the prep. Salsa was delicious!"}
{"text":"good breakfast burritos. wait sometime isnt usually long when i go but you can call it in before you head over and pick it up."}
{"text":"We were actually kind of excited to try this place because it looks like a hole in the wall Shack! Those are usually the best. We are very surprised though that it would didn't live up to our expectations. We ordered from the menu and had to wait about 10 minutes for our food to be finished. The Shack is actually an open-air establishment so there are flies everywhere. The food was just okay. We might go back to try breakfast sometime, but probably not for lunch or dinner again."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Everything is fresh and delicious. The meat is tasty. They even messed up my order once and whatever they gave me was amazing! Haha. Love this place. Everything is so good. My favorite is the southwest burrito but I also like the breakfast burrito (eggs, sausage, potato and cheese) plus pickled jalapeños and onions. Delicious. The mild salsa is really fresh, homemade and so good!"}
{"text":"You want to talk about a little secret in Gilbert? This is it. I drove right past this place for years when I went to ASU East and I've lived right around the corner for 3 years now. It's a dump on the outside... Literally a shack, but a friend recommended it, so I tried it for breakfast. Seriously, one of the best breakfast burritos I've ever had. Customer service is great, too. I just wish this place was advertised a little better, because I would have came here sooner!"}
{"text":"There breakfast burrito is good. The mild salsa is really good. Unfortunately I think they put way too much eggs and not enough potatoes and bacon. If you eat there be prepared to hit your head on the really low ceilings and also attacked by flies."}
{"text":"The BEST breakfast burrito in the east valley. Fresh ingredients, great service, clean, and fast! We have been searching for great breakfast burritos for years and finally found them here!"}
{"text":"I didnt have a good first experience when I went here, it was cause I went here when they were trying a different cheese. I wrote a bad review and I was contacted by the owner Kurt. He wrote that by the time I wrote the review they had changed the cheese back to the one they used to use since they had a few to many bad reviews of it. We went back to give it another try on the house by Kurt for our bad experience and let me tell you one of the best breakfast burritos I have ever had!!! Eggs were fresh and not over cooked, Bacon was crisp, cheese was melted as it should be in a hot burrito. There is nothing I would have changed about it great job. Pros - It is located close to the road, The works burrito, proactive owner who will make sure you are taken care of. dont judge this place by the outside there is good food inside. Cons - None on this trip. Comments - Thanks for everything Kurt we will be back to try some tacos."}
{"text":"I could drink the salsa!   I have tried a variety of their burritos, and they are delish!"}
{"text":"Best!! So good every time! We love the green chili and everything else... Chimi is always crisp and orders are always correct."}
{"text":"What a burrito! Great atmosphere and great food! Only open until 2pm each day. The college crowd is a plenty with the fun filled open space with a unique atmosphere"}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior fool you, Burrito Shack has the best burritos and is the best kept secret in town! Blink and you'll miss this hidden treasure on the east side of Power Road just south of Ray, but it's a fantastic family run business in Mesa and well worth a visit if you like good Mexican food. Open for breakfast and lunch, you can't go wrong with any choice you make! My favorites are the Gilbert breakfast burrito and the California burrito for lunch. They are good sized burritos and can be quite filling so try the small size instead of the \"shack size\" if you're looking for a smaller portion. My biggest piece of advice? Call ahead! They are usually pretty busy and you'll find yourself waiting for your order (which can be brutal during the summer). Call ahead to place your order and save at least 10-15 minutes of waiting. Check it out and you're guaranteed to have a great meal and a warm interaction with their friendly staff!"}
{"text":"The Colorado burrito is the best and what great beef tacos! The location is a little inconvenient as they share a small parking lot with 2 other businesses bit the food is. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Burrito shack is literally a shack on the side of Power rd. I past by this place numerous times and one day decided to try it out. The food is awesome the burritos taste amazing the service is good. Its a he in the wall looking place but it adds to the appeal of the place. Great spot my only complaint are the hours of operation are horrible. Other than that it's great check them out!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here and I thought the food tasted amazing. The one thing I have to comment negatively on though is the young woman who was helping us in the front. She had a bad attitude, very unfriendly and made me feel rushed when trying to decide what to order. Overall the experience was good minus the rude employee in the front."}
{"text":"Seriously the most overrated place ever. Waited 25 minutes for our food, when our name was called I proceeded to the pick up counter to initially grab food that wasn't ours-turns out their is another person with the same name as my wife; fair enough! As I let the gentleman know that it wasn't ours and if he could check on our order-I noticed one of the workers eating right at the pick up counter (looked as if he got a hold of a dirty diaper, it was just a bean burrito....WTF?) which I don't want to see an employee eating next to where my food is being made. Long story short, the employees have an arrogant hipster way about them, the food is just okay and the wait is ridiculous! If you have 30-45 minutes for lunch.....go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall literal shack with reasonable prices and yummy food. Really good! Not crowded for lunch. Will be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Good place! Reasonable prices, good size/portions, and good flavor mix.  Seating is limited, covered and outside, not air conditioned."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm still the only person that doesn't like this place?? I don't get it. What am I missing? Oh I know... FLAVOR.   Gave this place a 2nd try and was even more disappointed than the first time. Got a breakfast burrito with eggs, beans, cheese (supposedly), and green chilies. I may as well have had a piece of cardboard. Seriously, NO FLAVOR. I poured their salsa and hot sauce all over it and I barely noticed it (they use the word \"hot\" very liberally).   Perhaps if I ate meat other than chicken I'd like the food here, but both the chicken burrito I had the first time and the breakfast burrito I had today were tasteless, so 2 strikes and you're out on this one."}
{"text":"Okay when you pull up you will question the amazing reviews as I did, but push through it's so amazing!! I love the California burrito, best I've had in AZ and for a great price! Me and boyfriend love this place! I only wish they were open later!! That's the only thing that stops me from attending more!"}
{"text":"The same folks who used to own La Comida Ranchera or Ole! in Gilbert. Some say we moved down the street from there to be close to the food. I cried a little inside when they closed.  Made me really happy when they opened the Burrito Shack and I have threatened a few times to move towards them.   Try the chicken chimi with green sauce. I normally don't care for spice but the flavor is worth the burn!"}
{"text":"Don't know how the food is.  We tried to go on the fourth of July, and knowing they might not be open called first.  They said they were closing early at 1:00, but when we got there at 12:05 they had already closed.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm a native to AZ and love a good breakfast or carne asada burrito. This place is by far my favorite for both. The country breakfast burrito with gravy on the inside is the best. The staff and owner are super friendly also. I call ahead and they have it ready for pick up."}
{"text":"OMG! Amazing carne asada burrito. Don't let the outside exterior fool you. Venture in for the good food."}
{"text":"Family owned and always right on the money. Love this place. Breakfast burritos are always a winner in my house. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside appearance fool you.  This is a great place for burritos especially for breakfast!  Not super fast so don't plan on being in and out but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I never make it here before they close but today I DID!  The steak and potato burrito was to die for.  Hubs got the biscuits and gravy and he said it was some of the best he's ever had. EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Update! Went for a breakfast burrito and it was awesome! Loved the bacon and the chorizo is right on the edge of how spicy I'd want.  So good!    New to town and dropped by this place because it looked like a cool hole in the wall spot. Was not disappointed. I had the carne asada and it was great. It looked like they had a few breakfast options as well and I can't wait to come back to try. For sure worth a stop if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Stopping in while running errands. We got the breakfast country burrito with extra gravy. Love this place."}
{"text":"I'd been dying to stop by forever! I live literally right down the street but never made it in before closing. Finally stopped in early in the morning and got \"the works\". It was amazing! Not even ashamed to admit that I ate the whole damn thing within minutes. Can't wait to try the other burritos! The salsa was great, too. Reminded me of the good, authentic stuff I'm used to back home. I don't know how anyone could not like this place. But then again, if you refer to a burrito as a burro, you probably don't know what you're talking about. A burro is a donkey."}
{"text":"Heard quite a bit about the shack but wasn't impressed.   ordered 2 shack sized breakfast burritos and 2 kids burritos. Must've caught them on a busy day as my wait was 45 minutes from order to receiving food, didn't know I was at a restaurant.   What made matters worse was their was another customer with my same name, had been there longer, and had spent less than myself. So when they called my name out, confusion set in. The other decided to cancel his order and ask for a refund, as they had misplaced his order.   I've had better for less money and faster service. Hopefully I just caught them on a bad day."}
{"text":"Came here because I only have 10 minutes for lunch and this was the closest place.  A hole in the wall Shack. Really hard to spot unless you're looking for it. Dirt parking lot.  Upon entering from the side, the ordering station is on the back left corner of the building. Inside is for pick up if you want to wait.   Pretty extensive menu. I ordered the carne asada burrito shack size. Cashier was friendly. Service was pretty  quick.  Carne asada was cooked right and not dry, but could use a little bit more flavor. At least it's not salty. Pretty good size burrito if you get the shack size. You will definitely get full if you finish it. Comes with a side of hot sauce, which you will definitely need to give a little bit of moisture to the burrito.   Tip: Eat the burrito while it's hot and fresh.   Burrito was packed with lettuce onion guacamole and some other stuff I can't remember. Just a mixture of everything in your mouth.  I did not have to wait that long, as compared to other reviews. Maybe it wasn't that busy when I was there.  Price was around $9-10.  Not the cheapest, but you could probably make 1.25 meal out of it."}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance of the place to discourage you, in this place you definitely be happy and satisfied,  food is DELICIOUS!  First time with my hubby, he got a carne asada burrito and I got the green chile pork burrito. The carne asada was good but the green chile pork was AMAZING!  prices are more than fair for the size of the burritos. Open from 6:30 am to 2:00 pm.  Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"For all the hype this place had from fellow Yelpers, I was excited to try out Burrito Shack. Unfortunately, my visit provided me an experience equal to that of what I would expect out of a shack. The guy who took my order was rude, rushed me, and didn't care to try to explain or recommend anything. I was here at a time when nobody else was there, so I wasn't holding up a long line or anything. To just try something, I went with the Carne Asada burrito. This is a burrito that is really hard to mess up, but somehow they managed to.   The menu is full of options, making it hard to direct anyone to what is \"specialty.\" The building itself is pretty cool once inside though! Was cool to try out, but haven't returned since and don't plan to."}
{"text":"Can not love this place more! The food is amazing! You get so much for a small price, always leftovers! So fresh, amazing taste! I recommend everything!! Super nice staff."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place.  Flavorless and can't get my order correct.  I've tried it several times and have tried several menu items but everything is blah.  Would rather go to Del Taco...."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while because I've heard great things about it, and when I finally got the chance to today, I'll tell you that it definitely met my expectations.  I'm always looking for a good burrito, and when I can get it from a place that's literally a shack, that's an even bigger plus!  The burrito shack is located on the side of a dirt road, and if you're not looking for it, you'll definitely miss it.  When you get there, you order from a window and have a variety of options to choose from.  They have a good number of ingredient combinations for their burritos, and for those of you that like to customize your food, like I do :) they have a separate list of ingredients you can add, such as cheese, jalapeños, etc.... They also have two burrito sizes, small and large, and for people like me that can never finish a full burrito, this is a blessing! Now, if you're looking for authentic Mexican food, this place may strike you by surprise at first because it doesn't seem like it is, but the burritos are just as good as some of the best places I've tried in Southern California.    Recommendations on what to order:  - machaca con papas - amazingly delicious! I added cheese, guacamole, and onions to it and loved it! The machaca is shredded beef and really flavorful, and the potatoes are cubed so it's pretty filling.   - green chili pork - also really good! You don't even need salsa for this one because it is so flavorful and has a nice kick at the end"}
{"text":"Ok. This is a tough review for me to write. It is possible that my expectations were a little too high for this little shack so many seem to enjoy. In considering a quick bite to eat I recommended we check it out since it's been on our list for a while.   Unfortunately, it did not make the cut. I have stressed that I want to go back and maybe going in about 40 minutes before they closed was a bad idea. It was all simple enough, there were only a few dining when we got there so the wait wasn't exceedingly long even though I had read they offer the ability to order ahead.   My guy went with the Carne Tacos, I had the sm Veggie Burrito. Now, I am not a vegetarian by any means but I certainly lean heavier toward veggies than meat most of the time. The genetleman in the window asked if we would like hot or mild sauce we responded that we would like both. It's tough to know which you like when it is a first try.... Well, we got both, one of each for both of us. I know sometimes I like to douce my things in mild sauce and then top them with hot. Well, I was now sharing my sauces with my man who had two of his one tacos and well luckily I had the smaller burrito otherwise there wouldn't have been any sauce. It did indicate there was cheese.... where? where is the cheese? there's cheese on this thing? was it melted into the rice and guac? If it was there was no taste of it no sign of it nothing. Admittedly, there wasn't much flavor to any of it. Neither plate. My tortilla was cold. Like just pulled out of the refrigerator cold. Maybe that is the way they serve them? However, my guys tacos were cold and wet. I think perhaps they made his before mine or they weren't really made to order and had been sitting there. He mentioned they were cold and wet, it appeared cold and wet. Mine was cold, apart from the rice in side. I liked the broccoli and carrots but may have chosen a different item had I known the steamed veggies were just broccoli and carrot. I don't know, it was just and overall underwhelming experience. I overheard a customer who may have been familiar recommend the California burrito to her friend. This was what I had been eyeballing and decided that my veggie burrito might have a delicious blend of something sort of Mexican like in it maybe some bell peppers or onions but nope.   As I said, I may have just really wanted a melt in your mouth experience so that I could bulk up all round and cozy for winter, living off of burritos. That was not the outcome. So, when we have time and they're open, we will give it another shot. Not anything we are likely to go out of our way for. May have been a bad day but they had like 20 people behind the glass and could have pushed out some bomb food with all of that help."}
{"text":"On my way to the Power Road Farmers Market, I noticed a lot of cars and people enjoying outdoor breakfast here. I quickly checked Yelp n saw the good reviews. I picked up two bfast burritos on the way back for my husband and I (one ham and one bacon) for $9.50 including tax.  Despite the crowd, the service was fast (four chefs in the back) and friendly.  Delicious homemade cooked-to-order burritos with PLENTY of perfectly cooked eggs and PLENTY of Bacon and Ham. No grease!  My husband is a burrito snob and he loved it.  Will definitely become regular customers  while we live in Gilbert."}
{"text":"The Burrito Shake was a really good quick meal. Loved the outdoor eating and picnic area. Surprisingly good!"}
{"text":"Had the California burrito here. It was a burrito with French fries inside that was unique. Nothing outstanding but nice to mix it up if your tired of the average burrito."}
{"text":"If i had not read the reviews i would not have stopped here because it really looks like (from outside) a dirty rundown shack.  They are very nice and friendly. I wanted the veggie delux but they where out of veggies so i got the big papa.  I will remember to 1) come early and 2) get the smaller size burritto."}
{"text":"The Burrito Shack is not a dining establishment you would see on the side of the road and think to yourself  \"Hey, that looks like a great place!\" It truly is a shack, and depending on your own tastes, you'll either think it looks grubby or shabby chic. (I think it has character and is cute.) Expect a very rustic eating area and you won't be disappointed.  It only earned three stars from me though, because of two disappointments. (I had the California Burrito.)  Disappointment #1 : The temperature of the burrito was terrible. The cheese wasn't melted at all, and the tortilla was barely lukewarm. To compound my disappointment, I took a bite of my husband's green  chili burrito, and his tortilla was hot and tasty with melted cheese inside.  They really need to make sure that all types of burritos are hot and delicious,  Disappointment #2: The carne asada was cooked right, but was very bland. They really need to season the meat more.  If they could serve their burritos hot, I would readily give them 4 stars. If I go back another time, I'll try a different burrito and hope for the best."}
{"text":"Edit: try the California or the green chili pork breakfast burrito if you can't decide!"}
{"text":"My son and his wife are in town and he wanted a burrito so I found this place on Yelp. So today we went for lunch, I ordered a crunch beef taco and a fish taco with a side of beans. My son got the California burrito and my daughter in law got the carne asada fries. We all agreed that the food was good and well priced. Why I gave it 3 stars...the girl at the window seemed to be annoyed, irritated, hung over...I'm not sure but she certainly shouldn't be dealing with customers. She was not friendly, refused to smile and was really rude and short. I had to go back to the window so I could get a fork for my beans and so I tapped on the window and she looked up and said something and then got up and opened the window...no, how can I help you or is everything okay...nothing. I asked her if I could please have fork so she took 3 steps back got and fork and handed to me. I told her thank you and she again didn't smile, wouldn't look at me and literally went ummhumm and shut the window. Not sure if I'll go back simply because she had an awful attitude and it's hard to be nice to people who aren't nice when they are in a customer centric environment. Oh and I left a tip because I'm nice and I hope it has to be shared with the cool staff because they all looked happy and they are the ones doing actual labor."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this restaurant, mainly because it's hiding in plain sight. I have to say that it is a welcome change of pace. I had their shredded beef burrito and it was great. The service was excellent, and the food was prepared promptly. I sat outside and was able to watch airplanes and helicopters due to the proximity of the airport, which was very enjoyable. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wherever highschool and college kids hang out ot get lunch, I'm always going to check it out. They (the hs kids) are usually frugal (cheap) and want lots of quantity and decent-good quality. I had literally driven past this place a few times right when I moved into the neighborhood and missed it. I checked it on Yelp, but I was a little put-off by the overall appearance. Don't let it fool you.  Visually the place is right out of something you'd see in TJ, They say they put the money back into the food and not the building. You'll find old plastic lawn chairs and homemade wooden tables to sit at, It adds to the legitimacy of the business - you come here for the food and VERY casual setting. There has been a lot of construction on Power road, which has made access sometimes tough if you're in a lowered car. The parking lot is gravel/dirt.   The owners and workers inside are so nice. I once bought a candy bar from her son who was selling them for a fundraiser. They are polite and never ever rude.  It can take a little bit of time to get your order, especially if they are busy. If you're in a jam for time- call it in ahead so it's ready for you.   I have had California burrito, taquitos (rolled tacos), quesadilla, bean rice cheese potato (BRCP) burrito, fries and chips. I haven't had any breakfast burritos... yet.  If you're hungry, I would suggest the \"Shack\" size on the burrito size, as its well, duh, bigger. It's not Chipotle with-every-ingredient-possible-sized-burrito big, but its moderately big."}
{"text":"First visit. Called in order for pick up. Service was great! The food was good not great, average! I will swing in again to try something else as the this place is convenient for a Saturday family breakfast.  We will see????"}
{"text":"Really good food and a good selection.  The shack burro is great!"}
{"text":"I woke up craving a breakfast burrito and decided to try this place.    It's truly a shack.   A shack that makes one mean tasting burrito.    Tons of style and character and the burrito was delicious with fresh ingredients.    The hot salsa was really good as well.  .   I'm going to make a habit out of this place.       Nicely done Burrito Shack!"}
{"text":"Burritos are amazing and the small is perfect size. The salsa needs a lot of work. A bit too runny and not much flavor. The chips were also a bit stale. Stick with the burritos and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"Green Chile con Papas will not disappoint. Their salsa is solid as well, I usually get enough to have that night with some chips. People complaining about the heat and the wait time, their name implies that both of those things are probably going to happen!"}
{"text":"I wish that this place didn't have such weird hours!  The burritos here are so good. I have tried a few and haven't found any that I don't like. My favorite is probably the Gilbert breakfast burrito.  Pro-tip: Call ahead with your order so that you don't have to wait!"}
{"text":"The works breakfast burrito with a bag of chips and salsa! Ohh yeah!!"}
{"text":"Ok I'm so sorry, I got this confused with backyard taco in Gilbert on S Higley Rd. I loved the Burrito Shack. Its an inside outside place and the food is made with simple ingredients and they are put together with such care and thoughtfulness and when you bite into the food it sings. When I get a chance I always look into the kitchen and I could see the that they are a day to day operation and that makes me smile. My wife whom loves Mexican food fell in love with this place. I learned a long time ago pretty walls and the best kitchen does not mean the best food. Places that have been around forever tell their own story.   Please go, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! My husband and I had been wanting to try it and we decided to stop in and order take out. To be honest, it did take a really long time for our order, but they do tell you that it is made to order and could take some time so order ahead if time is an issue. The food was delicious and the portions were huge! The employees were all friendly and it was just a cool vibe!"}
{"text":"I love the food that comes out of their kitchen.  Absolutely 5 star dinning.  Every item that I have tried has no equal.  I drive down from Snottsdale, for tacos and burritos.  Well worth the drive."}
{"text":"I found the Burrito shack driving by,it truly is a shack and I was a little leery but when I saw the line of people outside waiting to order burritos I decided to give it a try. There are a few tables inside but open so this time of year it is hot however it's the best deal in town and the best burritos I've ever had. Quite a few people called and order the burritos ahead of time which is a smart way to go however I had my Green chili breakfast Burrito In less than 10 minutes"}
{"text":"This place is literally a shack and hole in the wall place, but it has the BEST red and green chile burritos in all of QC. They are huge. One will do you although you will want to eat more. Go there today!"}
{"text":"Just want to say that the owners are such a  great people. Laura is always friendly, and always has a smile.  Love their food.  Made from scratch,  no preservatives. I differently will go back and recommend it. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Looove Burrito Shack! The owners and the food are awesome! The portion sizes are filling and the ingredients always taste fresh. A great Mom and Pop place that I have visited several times. I was put off the very first time I visited because it literally looks like a shack (that is intentional!) but once I tasted the food, I was hooked! I love that the owners are flexible with my crazy order of a vegetarian burrito with no real veggies--only rice, cheese, pico de gallo and guacamole. It's weird to a lot of people, but tastes so very good! I love going to this place and recommend it to others. Yum! : )"}
{"text":"My wife brought me to this restaurant for breakfast. She ordered a green chili egg and I ordered a carne Asada and egg burrito with cheese. First off, I have to say, that the burrito was jampacked with fresh eggs and a generous amount of beef inside it. The pico de gallo was used sparingly so but I am just adding their pico de gallo salsa to it which made it taste great. My wife enjoyed her green chili and egg burrito immensely. We ordered a tostada and chips as well. Will be taking those home since these two meals field us up. We will be back. Some might say it's a run down shack but I disagree. I think they play into their name in a great way."}
{"text":"Tried this place with my boyfriend this morning. It's super cute and the food is delicious. We will definitely be coming back. #supportsmallbusinesses"}
{"text":"Been a Burrito Shack fan for few years now.  Our fave is the green chile con papas with crispy papas.  When ordering ask for the papas to be well done or crispy and they should be a nice crisp consistency if eaten right away.  The next best burrito would have to be the California burrito with papas.   We've never really strayed from these two burrito choices, and probably never will, so when it's time for our favorite burrito fixation we just have to hope it coincides with their odd hours. This place is definitely worthy of a try if you are in the area during their business hours.  Oh, and have your order with the hot salsa. See ya there!"}
{"text":"This was such a disappointment. They get 2 stars for their gimmick and their service. It's literally a shack, a very clean one, with great quick service. But the food tasted like nothing... I got a shredded beef and cheese burrito and an extra 4 ozs of hot salsa just in case. I'm glad I did because I had to soak each bite with it. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and actually unwrapped the burrito and added salt..... I've never had to do that to a burrito. But the beef was tough and flavorless. Sorry guys. This hurts me too. I like your operation but that beef spoke for itself."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years, always loved the carne asada burritos but over the last few months the quality and consistency of the food has been fluctuating.    Today was the last time I'll go unfortunately.  I am very sensitive to liver and kidney flavors and there was definitely something wrong with the meat today.  Far worse than its been before.  I almost threw up because of the pungent taste.    Why two stars?  Because maybe it was just bad meat today or cross contamination with some other meats.  Sorry Burrito Shack, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Love burrito shack. Don't ever let the looks of it fool you. Great food, nice people and did I mention great food?!?!  I was skeptical about going to the Burrito shack at first, but once I did I get it pretty often. I have not tried many things because I am stuck on one burrito because it is so good. The service is always friendly and even when the wait is long they still get your food to you as fast as possible and my order is always correct."}
{"text":"I honestly don't get what all of he hype is about. So what? You got frozen fries on your burrito? Whoopty do. The food tastes average or less, and the staff isn't outgoing or overly friendly. Nothing special here except to ridiculous line and weird ass hours. It's supposed to be a burrito shack, not brunch spot."}
{"text":"Pros -delicious food -family run business -charming aesthetic -delightful and friendly staff  Cons -missed opportunity by not having a mascot called the Burrito Shark"}
{"text":"Delicious burritos filled with tons of goodness! I had the shack size carne asada that was full of lots of meat, beans, cheese and gauc! I tried the red and green sauce and they both were very good! The prices are very reasonable, the kids egg and cheese and bean and cheese were $1.25 and the same size as the small! I have been on a taco adventure during my visit but had to try Burrito shack and it did not dissapoint!"}
{"text":"Whoa nelly! This place is amazing! Great service with a smile at the walk up window, the food is made in small batches with love! The Connis burrito is great, the chunky salsa I will dream about! Don't let the exterior keep you away, this place rocks!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here finally.  I had fish taco and smaller taco burrito.  Taco nothing real fancy but very tasty.  Burrito almost as big as the California burrito that hubby had.  Everything was delicious.  The mild sauce was excellent.  Will continue to return trying something different each visit.  Try the Burrito Shack."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! It's literally a shack, not much to look at, but don't let that fool you! I love the Mexican food here, it is scrumdidallyumpshious! Prices are cheap and you get a ton of food! My favorite is their Carne Asada Burrito! Stuff full with steak, beans, pico, guacamole.... my tummy is very happy after eating here! I got my food baby on (huge full tummy that makes me look pregnant) then I went back to work and tried to concentrate while in a bliss of food comaness! Great little spot for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican food restaurants in the East Valley.  The only complaint that I have is that they are only open until 2pm.  I brought my fiance there and she swore she would never eat anything made in what appeared to be a tin shack.  It is now one of  her favorite places to grab a Saturday lunch!  I just wish you were open later so we could eat there more than once a week!"}
{"text":"We love this burrito place and have ordered there for the past year. The staff are friendly and the burritos are made to order, so it takes some time, but so worth it. Thanks for all your hard work!"}
{"text":"Good little dive type place to get a burrito. No indoor seating but there is a covered/shaded area with 10 tables or so. Closes at 2pm so it's really just a lunch and breakfast place.    I had 'Connies Favorite' which was pretty good and had a ton of tender chicken on it. My wife had the 'chorizo con papas' and she loves it, a little too much chorizo for my liking.   Just remember this is rated 4 stars for what it is, it's not a classy joint, just a dive with decent tasting food and decently priced food."}
{"text":"I've had several different burritos here and they all were good, but not good enough to keep me coming back, except for the California burrito. It has crinkle cut fries, guacamole, carne asada, cheese and sour cream. This item alone is what keeps me coming back. It is a must try."}
{"text":"Awesome burritos!  My personal favorites are The California and Chile Colorado.  Both bring amazing authentic flavors.  If it's breakfast I'm after, Gilbert is my go to, carne asada with eggs and cheese is super tasty.  Don't be alarmed when you see the \"shack\", I assure you the kitchen is nothing short of immaculate, not to mention health inspector have been by, nothing to worry about.  I laugh so hard when I hear the people in line who are so concerned they might get sick, ridiculous.  If you are a mind over matter person, maybe you shouldn't eat here, but if you are looking for a grand burrito at a great price, this will soon be your regular spot!"}
{"text":"Great food but gotta get here before 2pm because they close early. Try machca burrito, carne asada burrito and tacos...all great. There r 2 sizes for burritos, the small is very filling. Chips are super fresh...gotta stop here nxt time we visit Mesa."}
{"text":"This place has off hours, but if you happen to be driving by while it's open you should defiantly stop in.  All of their burritos are awesome!  Dining in is a bit like dining in a shack so I guess it stands up to its name."}
{"text":"They have the best breakfast burritos! Don't let the \"shack\" atmosphere scare you away! I have not tried their lunch items, but other people have told me they like it as well. Their eggs are not too dry and the tortillas are fresh, never dry, and taste really good. I would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place since it looks like it belongs in a Mexican desert mirage where you somehow lurch from starvation to eating the best tacos ever. It actually sucked ass and was filthy and run by white people who only got the \"shack\" part right. Now they should work on making their food better. The second star is for the lack of AC even when it's 108 degrees; I kinda liked that part."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time. Actually my parents eat here often and we were visiting so this was my first time eating here. The food was delicious. Absolutely delicious! I didn't even mind that we were actually eating in a shack! Lol The prices are so low too. You won't be disappointed if you eat here! I had the best burrito I've ever had.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the girl that took our order was not friendly at all. She seemed annoyed to be doing her job. Customer service is a huge priority to me in any service industry (and I've worked in it almost my whole life). It doesn't hurt to crack a smile."}
{"text":"I'm new to Arizona, coming from Los Angeles and of Mexican decent, so I've tasted many flavor-sum burritos. This place is on the top of my list, I'm sure it could be #1 if tha salsa could be more flavorful with some spice. Overall its delicious, and ill be a regular."}
{"text":"Carne asada burrito was below average. The meat was tough and there was some gristle. I have had the bacon breakfast burrito a couple times and it was good. I will not get the carne asada again."}
{"text":"Their chorizo burrito is the bomb! So delicious! I recommend it with added beans and you'll be in heaven!"}
{"text":"A real hole in the wall joint in a gravel lot - What this place lacks in aesthetics it makes up in price and quality.   The price is pretty comparable to Chipotle and Filibertos and they have a pretty decent amount of choices on their menu. Stick to anything with Carne Asada!  The hours are a bit weird too 6:30am-2pm"}
{"text":"Get the California burrito. I'm from California and the burritos don't taste nearly as good as the Burrito Shack's!"}
{"text":"I have probably passed by this place a thousand times on my way to ASU Poly, but after a yelping for some breakfast burritos finally went. This place is literally a SHACK, which would be no problem except that it was a 100 degrees and there is no AC. If you are not going to eat there/ it is not winter time I would oder ahead to avoid the wait in the heat. We were disappointed that they ran out of chorizo, but we ordered a California, Gilbert, and Red Chili Burrito all grilled (50cents extra). All the prices were pretty reasonable for what you get in all about $5-6 each. Flavors were ok nothing exceptional-they also forgot the potatoes in the Gilbert burrito. The salsa was a plus and add some good flare, but the eggs were to gelatinsous and not scrambled enough"}
{"text":"Best taco I've had since I moved to Arizona 4 years ago.  They close at 2:00 everyday, so don't plan your supper around this place."}
{"text":"Best burritos I've ever tasted from NV to AZ! Seriously can't find anywhere comparable"}
{"text":"PHENOM place for breakfast, and great for lunch.  They close at 2 pm!"}
{"text":"Love the food! Good customer service, love the atmosphere laid back vibe and ridiculously fair prices! Have never had a bad experience here. Wish they were open pass 2 pm ha :)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  Like everyone one else, we would drive by and it looks scary on the outside.  We read a few Yelp reviews just to see what it was a bout and decided to try it.  I am so glad we did!   You are greeted by the nicest person taking your order.  They are very helpful for first timers.  You can see everyone in the back making things from scratch in small batches.  We got a Connis Burrito, chips and salsa, a ground beef taco (My new favorite!) and a chicken taco.  The food was amazing and we had to order more salsa as we ate it all.   The service was great and they remembered our name.  They ran out of some things and someone came out and apologized to everyone and told them their food would be out shortly.  No one seemed to care as everything was being made fresh.   It's really clean on the inside and the food is made with love!"}
{"text":"Woke up early about to head out of town for the weekend decide to stop and try this place based off of the yelp reviews. We live right around the corner from this place and I've never tried but my son and husband has and loved it. They insisted on coming here.   Lady that took our order was nice and cheery. I ordered the Conni's favorite. It wasn't too bad but not my favorite it so far. It had steak meat and green chile. It was really messy to eat and maybe if it had a little more vegetables and less green chile it would of been better.   Will try this place again but definitely a different burrito."}
{"text":"Finally! I finally got to try Burrito Shack... It always seemed like they are closed during hours I can make it there to give it a chance.  The burritos are a meh size for lunch. Definitely filling, but I know w few contenders around the valley that can eat these burritos for dinner. BUT!! The green chili is pretty delicious. I tried the Cali burrito as well and my husband really enjoyed it. I'll agree with a few other Yelpers the flavor is missing just a bit... Something just lacks. It's a nice place to try when you have burrito cravings and need a quick fix."}
{"text":"We finally checked this place out.  Based on reviews, we had breakfast there when it was cooler weather.  Food was great!  They used real chorizo.  The theme lives up to the name.  It really is a shack.  I felt like I was on vacation in the Caribbean.    I will be a regular here."}
{"text":"Came for my all time favorite breakfast a breakfast buritto. Amazing green chili! Being from the Colorado/new Mexico area I am a huge fan of green chili and this is the best I have found around here. Flavor is incredible and spice is just right. Unfortunately the eggs in the buritto were a real let down and I think could use a big improvement. Overall pretty dang good though."}
{"text":"I have been driving by this place for a year.  I love dives and authentic Mexican food.  I was terribly disappointed.  I ordered the carne asada burrito and a taco.  The burrito was big and had great value.  However, it was dry and the steak was tough and chewy.  The taco was not good value for $1.95.  It was no no bigger or better than the  69 cent basic taco that you get at fast food places.  Sorry yelpers but my review does not agree with the majority."}
{"text":"I've been passing this place daily for 3 years. Finally stopped in for a chorizzo burrito. What a mistake. Now I know that the best breakfast burrito in the world is right there waiting. Time to either change my commute route or buy bigger clothes. I would have stopped years earlier, but from the street it looks a bit scary.  That's obviously by design, and I wouldn't let that stop you if you have been considering trying it out."}
{"text":"Been here 5 or 6 times now and they do not disappoint! Everything I have tried here is really good, the carne asada and machaca burritos are my favorites, the biscuits and gravy is also very good, if I'm kraving a burrito this is the spot"}
{"text":"Good people get high reviews.  We went to Burrito Shack over the holidays, and the employees there were fantastic and friendly.  Honestly, the burritos were so-so.  We are from New Mexico, so we do lots of Mexican - I thought the plain burrito with red chile was awesome.  The rest seemed really dry.  \"Carne\" is carne aside, not carne adovada - a substantial letdown, but probably my fault for assuming based on my New Mexico roots.  Overall - it was good.  I will go back again, I am sure."}
{"text":"For a place that doesn't look like much, the Burrito Shack delivers on flavor. Get the Green Chili con Papas if you like it spicy. Add a side of hot salsa for extra kick. The papas in this one are fried like French fries, so you get a nice crunch to offset the spicy chilis and big chunks of pork.  Don't expect ambience and you won't be disappointed. In the summer, you may need to grab your order and go somewhere that has A/C... like your car."}
{"text":"Great food!  Green chili Quesadilla = excellent.  Shredded beef chimichanga = delicious!  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much to be honest, but the carne asada fries were amazing! Guess you can't judge a book by its cover after all. Just a quick warning, all the seating is technically outside, so I was a bit toasty as I'm visiting from Minnesota."}
{"text":"My husband and I got some of the best burritos we've ever had here. He got a chorizo one and I got pork, potato, and green chile. So good!!"}
{"text":"C'mon folks. Anyone going more than 3 stars here is being silly.  This is about on par with Filibertos except in a much dirtier environment. Dusty non air conditioned dining area with super uncomfortable seating. This is a very LDS style hodge podge of a dining area. Whatever could be found at the Thrift store if I had to guess.  Nice people working there though. Don't expect a conversation however if you are from out of town. People in this part of AZ are very very dry."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  It is our go to Breakfast for Saturday morning.  Don't let the outside fool you there is some seriously good eats happening inside this magical shack. We usually go for the Shack burrito or the Works. We have never had a bad bite of food from this place and recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Found this place looking on Yelp for a good Mexican food spot. All the reviews looked promising I'm a firm believer that hole in wall spots have the best food. This place did not disappoint.  I had the best chorizo burrito in life.  They also make a tasty Arnold Palmer. The customer service was great as well. I'm only in the area two more days and I definitely plan on going back. Only sad thought is they aren't open tomorrow (closed on Sundays)."}
{"text":"Many years ago, about 8-9 years ago? (jeeze), when I was in high school, my friends and I would pass this place and joke about going there. \"On that's the place that will send you to the hospital across the street hahaha\" kind of stuff.  Then one day, my friend Kyle braved the dares and decided to eat here. And he came every day for a month. So I decided to meet his challenge and try it. I ordered their California burrito for 5 dollars and received a burrito that changed my life. I've been a faithful burrito shack customer ever since.   The aesthetic of this place isn't much, but it isn't trying to be. They don't have ac, they have water bags to keep flys out. But who cares, the food is awesome. I, and my friends, have since moved away from AZ. Any time we are back we hit up the burrito shack. I took all my groomsmen here after my wedding for a thank you burrito. My best friend asked me to be in his wedding here. I've discussed the most important things here like life, the future, marriage, and the every day stuff like tv and video games. What does this have to do with a restaurant? Well that's just what burrito shack is. It's more than good food, it's a quirky place where you make memories with friends that last a life time."}
{"text":"So I decided to stop by and check out this Burrito shack with all the great reviews last Saturday. Only a couple of people there so I thought I would get in and out. I ordered the carne burrito and that's it. I sat in the shack waiting area and trust me its a shack. Flies everywhere and garbage on the floor from other customers food. I waited and waited then 25 minutes later I get my burrito on a paper plate with a side of salsa. By this time I was really hungry and thinking that it was going to taste great because I waited that long. The burrito was luke warm and had no smell to it? Anyways like the review said don't judge a book by its cover so I took a bite..... the meat was tasteless and cold. I unwrapped it to look at the insides while the flies were landing on it and it was packed with the carne but it was disgusting looking like old meat. This is the worst place to come for Mexican food ever. NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO HERE, DISGUSTING!  I honestly think this place is getting FAKE POSITIVE FEEDBACK. The only way you would think this was good Mexican food is if you're dead drunk."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place out for awhile. The place is literally a shack but omg don't let that deter you from checking it out.  I ordered the California burrito which had carne asada, guac, potatoes, and sour cream. With a side of chips and guac. People are super nice and the guac is super tasty. I would like a tub of just that with their paper thin chips. So addicting.  Carne asada in the burro was Delish. Some of the best I've ever had and the burrito was full of it.  Go check it out!! Sad they close at 2pm otherwise I would grab it for dinner on my way home from work."}
{"text":"I do not get what people are raving about..  I really don't.  Nothing good about the food, just ok.  There are a lot more and better mexican places to go to, and I do!"}
{"text":"Their enchiladas [red] rival some of the best New Mexican food I've had...and I'm a multi- generation New Mexico native born and raised .  I crave their red chile.    Only occasionally in the area for work related reasons (I have an office/Fire Center at Mesa-Gateway Airport) I have no issue eating lunch there every other day while working there.  But when I get a craving and I am not wanting to cook it myself and I am not in the area, I am so willing to drive the 35/40 minutes one way  from home just to get my fix.  Yes, with places like Dick's Hideaway/Richardson's relatively just up the street from me, I would drive to the Burrito Shack just for their red chile (burrito, enchiladas, or burrito enchilada style).  I have not tried their green chile but if it is as good and authentic as the red, oh watch out.    They are known for their burritos for good reason too.  They are quite large and the ingredients quality.    The price is sooo right here.  Very reasonable for the very generous portions.    This place is nothing fancy.  It has \"patio\"/outdoor dining but nothing indoor.  It is almost literally a shack.  During the summer I recommend calling your order in ahead and picking it up to avoid the wait in the heat as their Order/Pick-Up window is not an enclosed air conditioned situation."}
{"text":"Visiting Mesa for the weekend and happened to pass by this place.  I was craving for some Mexican food so I decided to stop by.  I ordered their carne asada burrito, and I must say, it was delicious!  The meat was tender and the flavoring was perfect!  So I decided to come back for their breakfast burrito the next day and again I was not disappointed.  The staff was friendly which made me want to come back.  When I find myself in Mesa again, this will definitely be a required stop!"}
{"text":"This lives up to the name, very divey and run down; meaning this is the home of the best burrito you will ever have!! I'm not the smallest appetite and the shack size burrito will kill any hunger!! So fat n' happy right now."}
{"text":"This rustic place has one of the best breakfast burritos. I always have the small chorizo and egg. The chorizo has a slight char to it which adds texture to this tasty delight. It has some heat but there are many other choices for breakfast or lunch. The food is fresh...the service is excellent and the price is very reasonable. Don't let the rustic presence of the Burrito Shack scare you away...it is part of its charm. Seating is in an indoor patio or outdoor lawn area. A favorite if in East Mesa. Way to go Kurt!"}
{"text":"Tried Burrito Shack for bfast -- it was adequate, but didn't live up to the Yelp hype.  Burritos came in 2 sizes, though the difference between the large and small was hard to discern.  Eggs were good and sausage was ok, but I was halfway into my burrito before I got a bite of potato.  As for the spuds, Burrito Shack uses crinkly fries; I prefer hash browns or home fries at bfast. For me, the best part of BShack was the friendly service.    I'd like to return and try some of their non-breakfast burritos, as the menu looks very promising. However, I can't offer more than 2-stars based on my first experience . . .  Cheers RS"}
{"text":"I have been to the burrito shack plenty of times before and have been given some pretty good tasting burritos. Today unfortunately was not one of those days. As I cut my burrito to proceed to take my first bite I found a long blondish/brown hair. I have short black/brown hair, so it was not mine. It was wedged way inside that I had to tug at it to get it to come out. I will say I give them two stars because they did allow me to get my money back or a new burrito."}
{"text":"It's actually a shack!  Haha, the people are very friendly and the food is fantastic! Highly recommended if you can break away from your air conditioning.   Their hot sauce is a must! :)"}
{"text":"I came across Burrito Shack on accident.... I was really hungry and just happened to drive by... I was scared at first by the looks of the building but it was all worth it.   Sadly, their food is too good and I can't stop going... I recommend the Carne Asada Fries!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Gilbert for some time, finally decided to give this place a shot. I got the carne asada, added rice to it and enchilada style. Got home to realize they put green chili over it instead of the red I asked for. I really hate green chili, but the burrito was very good in spite of needing to clear off as much of the green chili as I could.   I also got a bag of chips and a half pint of the hot salsa. The chips were excellent, light and crispy and tasted very fresh. The salsa had a great flavor, just the right amount of hot, but it was too watery (maybe thin is a better word). A little thicker and it would be perfect.  The hours of operation are pretty awful, which is the main reason it took me so long to try it out in the first place. Saturday is the only day I can eat here and even then they close too early to make a dinner of it, unfortunate. I am a fan, but won't get to eat here very often."}
{"text":"Great burritos that will rival some of the best I have had over a couple states. The only reason I give a 4 and not 5 is - they are pretty heavy on the stomach.   Cool joint to hang out outside and relax.  We had the California and the southwestern - both were good but I am a fan of the southwestern."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday lunch at my request. The food was so good, the portions were just right and left us feeling great. This place is a must try for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Oh, man, love this place. What an authentic crap-hole place, that serves awesome burritos. And the burritos are (way too) affordable. The veggie burrito is one of my local favorite veggie burritos."}
