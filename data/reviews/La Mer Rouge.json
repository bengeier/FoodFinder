{"text":"We were visiting Montreal and decided to try this restaurant as it delivered to our hotel. We checked out the website and noted that they listed pictures for every single meal. Big plus. We ordered a few different dishes including the barbecued shrimp, fish and chips, shrimp and calamari, and the family plate (a super large plate with multiple types of whole fish and fillets, shrimp, calamari, and rice). Not one person in my party was dissatisfied with their plate! The food was well seasoned and flavorful (even the fries and the rice). Please note that the shrimp is \"peel and eat\" shrimp. This was my only complaint as they put a lot of seasoning on the outside and I was afraid that it would not permeate the shrimp inside. Thankfully, the flavor did get inside somewhat. Overall, I would definitely order from here again. I would have done so sooner if the prices were a bit cheaper. That being said, I think all of the food was worth the price, and we even had leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"I've had this place deliver at my job a couple of times. 
First time was quite simply the best shrimp I've ever had. Saut√©ed and slightly spicy.

The second time, it was the garlic shrimp with a side salad.
The salad was just OK, a bit tired and not fresh.
The shrimp was good, the only downside is the skin was still on, so a bit messy to eat.
I just wished a starchy side came with it so I sop up the garlicky oil left (prices are steep for sides like $6 for fries)

While he prices are not the cheapest, but it's standard for seafood, will try other items next time."}
