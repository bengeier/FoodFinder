{"text":"Way better than Qoola upstairs. Qoola and yogen fruz is a joke. The yogurt here is not self-serve which is great because i know my toppings have not been touched by dirty hands of other customers. This is the real thing here and all their fruit toppings are freshly cut!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love froyo and the toppings. I always think its so fun to play with the toppings but I was actually scared to try pinkberry as I knew that it's not self-served. The regular was $8 with topping and I thought that was pretty high since I didnt expect to get a lot of toppings. Boy was I wrong. The service was AMAZING, the employees were letting me and my friends try every flavours we wanted and when we finally decided on the flavours, they were soo generous with the toppings! I think I got a lot more toppings than I normally would get with the self-serve and I actually paid around the same price. They were telling me that I could add more if i wanted to but I was getting too much already lol. Anyways, they had, green tea, hazelnut chocolate, salted caramel, original, and mango i think and they were all really good! Also, the toppings choices were great! The quality and the fact that they are healthier than the regular froyo was amazing! Would defo go back again."}
{"text":"How can you not give Pinkberry a good review? It's simply the best! I have travelled around the world and had Pinkberry in Miami, LA, Las Vegas, Dubai, London, and Peru! There is no frozen yogurt that even compares to it so you can imagine my excitement when it finally came to my hometown in Toronto. I made the drive across the QEW to check out Square One which I have not done in a long time - just so I could get my Pinkberry fix! They did not disappoint. I don't know how they do it, but they have the best customer service in the game. Super friendly and always smiling! The place is extremely clean which I appreciate and it is full serve. I went for my go to with the Original Fro-yo which is hands down the best in the game. I also sampled Pink Grapefruit which was actually tasted like Grapefruit, but not really my thing. Even tried the Dairy-Free Tropical Mango and that was bomb! Tastes so light and refreshing like a sorbet and would go well with Blackberries which I will try next time! Thank you Pinkberry for finally coming to Toronto! Hoping for more locations closer to downtown soon."}
{"text":"Simply the best frozen yogurt in Toronto! This location is one of the best I've seen in the world. Cool design, great staff, and the best tasting froyo as usual! Pinkberry is sooooo much better than the rest."}
{"text":"Highest quality frozen yogurt on the market hands down. Too bad they removed the dark/bttersweet chocolate chips and replaced it with milk chocolate."}
{"text":"This is not just any frozen yogurt.  It is the freshest and cleanest.  Machines are cleaned out nightly not like the others that are left in their for days.  The toppings are only fresh fruit daily and a smorgazborg of goodies to add to it.  I also love the frozen ice cream and the honey comb toppings.  If you have not tried this yogurt your missing out on something special.  Get there.  Then write your review."}
{"text":"If you want the best freshest tasting treat, you have to stop by Pinkberry at Sherway.  I never go to the mall without stopping for my fix.  I thnk pink grapefruit is the featured flavour right now and it is so tangy and fresh.  Makes you feel like your in Florida in spite of the fact that we are in the cold north.  All fruit toppings are fresh daily and the machines are also cleaned out daily unlike the competitors.  I especially love the honey combs.  Amazing.  If you haven't tried it, your missing out on a great experience.  Get there and give it a try.  Write a review.  I'm anxious to hear what others think."}
{"text":"Photo looks a lot better than it tastes. $10+ for frozen yogurt with toppings. The frozen yogurt was not even good. Tasted nothing like what they had listed. Don't recommend anyone to try it. The topping were okay, pretty blan in my opinion."}
{"text":"The first time I had pinkberry was in Dallas TX, there is nothing quite like the original flavour.  I'm glad there's finally one in Mississauga."}
{"text":"It's in a crappy part of square one with very little seating.  The seating is also very dirty. I feel like for some reason this part of the mall does not get cleaned. It's near a Walmart and a Bulk Barn so I guess they think the standards are lower. They run out of ice cream and don't put signs up so while you're there waiting with your kids who want to eat chocolate ice cream you get up to the front and they say \"sorry we are out\". Why can't they put up a sign? I asked the lady why not and she said that it's automatic meaning the menus are automatic. She made no effort to try to fix the situation and her apology was apathetic. It's not her fault I guess as she is just a kid with no customer focus or work ethic (what's that?)."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Pinkberry, and before you say anything, Yes I went for FROZEN Yogurt during our recent cold snap. You really cannot help the cravings when they hit, and diet and healthy life choices be damned, we were jonesing for some froyo and there were no options except for a late evening mall visit just before closing time.  What I like about Pinkberry over other Froyo places is that they've limited your choices to a few flavours AND they don't try to screw you by making you pay by weight. I hate going to Menchies, pretending to be respectable only to find out that being \"good\" still runs me about $16! What?!!  At Pinkberry, they had 4-6 froyo flavours and once you choose your size and flavour they dress it for you with your choice of toppings. For those of you who enjoy paying $20 for a pound of Froyo and 800 grammes of cookie bites, this isn't the place for you BUT, if you go I promise it's the same experience without the wallet regret or the excess and shame.  I went with a small peanut butter and chocolate flavour with some almond cookie crumble and dark chocolate mini balls. Perfect. I then found out that on certain weekdays during the last hour of operation you can buy tubs of select flavours for only $5 with the purchase of any sized regular froyo. We went for it and bought a tub of dairly free coconut and one of the peanut butter.  Total bill for a well dressed small and two tubs was just over $20 and that was only because one of the tubs was regular price (not a select flavour on special). It's still a pricey treat but way more manageable!  Definitely come back - I know I will be, at all hours, whenever the cravings hit again  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped by here on our way out of the mall and my sister was thrilled to see a Pinkberry in Canada. She previously only had it in the USA and told me it is the best froyo! I asked her why and she said it's because they give you unlimited toppings. We got in line and my sister asked the employee if they provide customers with unlimited toppings like they do in the USA.  My sister was delighted when the employee responded with, \"Yes, we do! As long as it fits in the cup!\"  I asked the lady working if they had a dairy free flavour. She told me they did and offered me a sample. The dairy free mango sorbet was a bit too sweet for my liking, so I decided not to get a froyo. The lady working mentioned they sometimes have a coconut milk flavour, which is really good. Next time I'm at Sherway Gardens I'll have to see if they have this flavour.   My sister choose the original pink berry flavour and loaded it with her favourite toppings. She really enjoyed her froyo but said she was a little disappointed because they left they only put the froyo around the circumference of the bowl and left the middle hollow. She wished they filled it better. While we were leaving, we saw the employee making one for another customer and she really seemed to fill in the gaps and not leave it hallow like the one my sister received.  All over, my sister said her froyo tasted delicious and she would definitely go back.   Sisters Rating: 5-stars My Rating: 2-stars  Average: 3.5 stars!!"}
{"text":"My first visit here was amazing. The worker there deserves some sort of employee of the month award. She was so welcoming and immediately offered us to try samples. I instantly fell in love with their Mango flavour. Their original tart flavour has got to be one of the best out there."}
{"text":"So excited for a Pinkberry to finally open in Toronto!   This did not disappoint. Original yogurt is tangy tarte. Or you can choose their other flavours but original is my favourite. Pick your choice of fruit, candy, popping bobbas, cookies or nuts to top.  Located under the food court area."}
{"text":"Just like Qoola upstairs, they only get 2 stars. Why you ask? The whole fun of frozen yogurt is \"self serve\" for most people. I'm 1 of those  They need to let customers dispense their own yogurt & mix n match different flavours inside the cup."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try pinkberry! Pinkberry's first Ontario store opened officialy on Friday, August 21, 2015 at Square One. Pinkberry is the original tart frozen yogurt brand from Los Angeles, California. You always see celebs eating this treat so I was curious to try it out.   Ok....they serve fresh ingredients. They taste as good as they are for you. Their yogurt is made with real milk and real yogurt and their fruit is hand cut fresh daily. You can really taste the high quality ingredients.  Chocolate hazelnut frozen yogurt is amazing and I was able to try the pomegranate, green tea and vanilla... I wanted all of them lol the best part is that you can add as many toppings as you can fit in the cup. Just amazing. Also! The service is out of this world! Everyone was so professional and attentive! You've gotta try it!"}
{"text":"They were super accommodating towards my vegan needs and ventured to try a smoothie with no milk and water instead. Best staff ever!"}
