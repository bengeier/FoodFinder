{"text":"WOW!! How cool is this place??You have to check it out!! It is a small, cozy, quaint place. The food David prepares is mouth watering delicious. But don't take my word for it, go taste for yourselves! Louie did a beautiful job at creating a meet n eat stop, and shake a leg on the weekends with live bands! I am happy this place opened in my neighborhood, it's like having my own backyard party. Welcome to the hood Dirty Martini!   Ms Raven"}
{"text":"Whole in the wall ... not a great wine selection but really, really good martinis. 

My girls and I gave Dirty Martini Bistro & Bar a try last Friday for Happy Hour.  It was a great start to a Friday night.  We ordered hummus and chicken wings, will pass on both next time we visit.  You go here for the Martinis and Martinis only!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Dirty fries and dirty wings!! This place just opened and the food is here is fantastic!! I LOVE the dirty fries!! I can't wait to come back and try the martinis sounds delicious!! The service was great our food came out rather quickly and our server Casey had great suggestions and was very attentive!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"For a Martini bar you would think they would actually know how to make a Martini...wrong...wrong. Get your shit together and check your tone!"}
{"text":"This place is a great spot for parties and def should advertise at the local colleges. Went to a b day party and the place was nice with good parking and right off the light rail. It's small and you can't see it off the street. They even had a buffet and the food was really good! ( fried mac and cheese cat fish ect) ( only for event guest) The waitress are nice and polite and know how to make drinks. Unfortunately I'm a mixed drink kind of girl and not really into martinis but boy were they crafted amazingly to perfection."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and his father found this place and treated me to lunch. The two of them have eaten there a few times and, just like our visit today, they both say the restaurant is always clean, the condiments are chilled, and the service is pleasant and the entr√©es come quickly. 

My boyfriend had the Dirty Burger and said it is the best burger he has ever had! It has a fried egg, some sort of delicious garlic sauce, and a bun that is soft but doesn't get soggy. He's also had the Cuban and said it was quite good. I tried the Grass Fed Burger, which was also very well cooked. 

The chef personally greeted us, and let us sample a new item he is adding to his menu. 

Worth the drive, parking is hassle free, ambiance is pleasant, and the chef and staff are great."}
{"text":"Great new spot in downtown Phoenix. I dined here last evening and enjoyed every aspect of the meal. The wings are excellent and the burger is nicely seasoned with super delicious fries. The bar staff and owner are friendly and plenty of flat screen tvs on the walls. Excellent experience for an out of towner. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Last night was their soft opening. The place is all good vibes. The ambiance is very cool and relaxing. Beautiful mood lighting, brick walls and great music in the background. A friendly and attentive staff. I met the owner he was very nice and helping out his entire staff. Fabulous bartender! It was very busy with everyone arriving just after 7pm but it was great for a first night open! Once the food arrived It was absolutely delicious. Some of the best chicken wings I have ever had. That is saying a lot, because chicken wings are my fav! The pork belly slider was absolutely amazing. They didn't have a gluten free option, but they will in the future. They have a gluten free chef on staff! Amazing! The pork belly without the bun was tender and just perfectly cooked. The beef sliders were great with caramelized onions and cheddar. I also tried the truffle fries, they were crispy and delicious.
I can't wait to go back next week when they officially open and try more items. I will for sure be back for the wings!
Go hangout here with some great company and you will for sure have a fabulous time. 
Great drinks, food and plenty of parking for easy access!"}
{"text":"I will say, when I tried this bar it was very new. This may have contributed to my less than fabulous experience. I went with a friend towards the end of hh. The place was packed! There was nowhere to sit and getting any attention, even to get a menu, was a challenge. They had an interesting duo  playing music, who were fabulous, but loud for such a small space. When we finally got someone's attention (maybe 30 min after arriving), we ordered a couple drinks. We only ever received one of the drinks and that one drink wasn't super fabulous (i can't remember the name, but it had ginger beer and blueberry I believe). My friend never received her drink and eventually we gave up. Maybe I will give this place another shot after they have been open a bit longer.

Ps their hh is 4-7 and they have some food specials, mostly on pretty standard sounding bar food."}
{"text":"We rode the light rail to Chase Field last night. Got off at the 12th street stop to get a drink here before the game. One of the best martini's I've had! . The bartender was great and we enjoyed talking to her. I would highly recommend making this stop on your way downtown rather than the bars/restaurants next to the ball park. It's so easy to get off, have a drink and/or food, then get back on the light rail for the final stop."}
{"text":"This place is within walking distance of my downtown condo & my friend loves martinis so we thought we'd check this place out. Turns out, we made a good choice! The bartenders/ people working were very friendly. The drinks were delicious. She had a martini & I had the Phoenix Sunrise. 

After talking with us for awhile, the bartender offered to give us samples of some of their food. We tried a chicken wing and some of their pork belly. Well... the chicken wing was SO freaking good. The pork belly was good as well, but didn't compare to those wings. We can't wait to go back for a full order!

It's kind of in a bit of a sketchy area of town, but it's still a cool & unique place and I highly recommend you go check it out!"}
