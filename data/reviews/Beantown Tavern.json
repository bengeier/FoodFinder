{"text":"Me and a group of friends went to this place one night when they had live music. We had a very bad experiance and ended up leaving because of the rude service. We were a small group and we are obviously different looking than the crowd in the restaurant. The servers at the bar where very rude and no one offered to take our order or seat us. Then there was an open booth near the front and we asked to sit at that table and one of the servers told us that it was taken even though no one was sitting there. Like 10 minutes later a white couple came in and they offered the booth to them. We finally realized that there was a back room with empty tables and we went and seated ourselves and literally waited for 15 minutes before anyone even walked over to our table to ask for our drinks. They saw us seat ourselves which is why we finally got the hint that we were not welcome and got up and left. I think unless your a local in the neighborhood I would not visit this place. Very rude and unwelcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"this bar is racist full of good ol'boys and if you speak up they will tell you not to come back white only please do not spend black dollars here"}
{"text":"Really, don't waste your time and money on this place. Servers only don't have uniforms to make them stand out to figure out who is a server, they wear normal clothes.. They have attitude towards you and basically refuse to wait on you if they don't like you, so you get s visit from them 3 times if you are lucky when you are there. One: when they greet two: when you get your food/drinks and three: when you get the bill. Not the service I want and will not come back to this dump"}
{"text":"If you're from the New England area, this is your joint.  Patriots, Red Sox, BC, etc...all the time on a massive amount of plasma monitors.  Seriously, there's at least 23-30 of them.  I'm not from that section of the country, so the whole Boston thing wears a bit thin.  

The food is decent.  There's a substantial selection of bar-type food that's on par with the Fox & Hounds and Graduates, though a bit pricier.  The service was rather slow.  Might have to go back when the Panthers play the Pats to see what the local Boston contingent is like."}
{"text":"Not going back. It's the cleanliness of the place that still haunts me. 

5/15/2010 i sat on the patio. When you enter there are 2 lamps on the brick wall outside..one is totally busted. There are 3 ceiling fans on the patio that do not work. (one didn't even have the hardware attached just dangling cords.) Instead there was a floor fan on the bar. There were FLIES everywhere!!! I had to sacrifice half a beer because one went in and drowned...i barely noticed this!!! Not one bit of this review has anything to do with food...but everything to do with maintenance and impression. The tables and chairs were just dirty. I enjoy sitting outside, and i can name many places that are clean even outside...this is unacceptable for me. I wish i had taken pictures...it was surprisingly dirty as compared to last year."}
{"text":"Poor and slow service.. even it was just Saturday afternoon. We tried robster skins for an appetizer (6 potato pockets) Where is robster meat? More than half of it was just potatos and definately overpriced ($9.99] for potatos. Will not come back"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick in and out meal then you may want to think twice about this place. We were here on a Saturday afternoon and there was not even a wait for a table yet it took us an hour to get food. We were never told of the specials and didn't realize there were any until we heard another table being told. Of course we were offered an opportunity for a beverage however there was no follow up for a refill the entire time we were waiting for our food. Also after the food finally arrived there was no follow up to see if everything came out as ordered. I could go into more detail but as you can tell the speed and customer attention were quite lacking.

Now on to the food. I don't give two stars just based on a one time service problem however if a restaurant has such an issue coupled with bland food then there is not much to raise my rating. There was nothing inspiring and the food was quite mediocre. One person in our party had the taco salad and the salsa was just like barely spiced tomato paste and the shell not like the crispy tasty treat that you normally find in a taco salad."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was horrid! For a more than half empty restaurant it took 30min to get a club sandwich and hot dog! The waitress was standing around at the far end of the bar. Refills on drinks were not offered till the end of the meal!! Try not to go"}
{"text":"Took a friend here thinking they could get a black & tan since it's a tavern, but they didn't have them.  I had a burger.  Nothing to write home about, nothing to make me go back."}
{"text":"This place has all the underpinnings to be a great, hugely successful restaurant bar. Its a good place to watch football and have a few beers, but the the food is just okay and the service is unpredictable."}
{"text":"Great place to watch games and have a cold AB. The staff is nice. They also will put on any game. It is located in a cute part of town also. Go check them out!"}
{"text":"I have had dinner here once...the very first night I moved to town, and was impressed with the burger that I ordered, along with the evening waitress that we had.  I have been one other time for drinks & karaoke was going on at the same time...so entertainment was free! Great place to watch a game, but would suggest better beer selection."}
{"text":"My wife and I went on  Saturday afternoon. She had been before but this was my first time. The service was good. I had a salad and a bowl of clam chowder that was as good as any I've had traveling through New England. The portion was very large."}
{"text":"I moved to Matthews from Boston in August and was excited to learn of a local watering hole where I could catch a Sox game.  I went in during the week just after the lunch rush to check out the food and brew.

I was by myself and sat at the bar.  The bartender was friendly and attentive, but never wiped the bar in front of me where the previous customer had been.  My draft was nicely chilled but had an after taste indicative of dirty draft lines.  The menu was just as described in these reviews, and the calamari I ordered were surprisingly as good as some back in Boston.

As I continued to take the place in and appreciate the Sox memorabilia, it became apparent that the bar had at one time not been smoke free.  The air vent in the ceiling was filthy with tobacco stained dust bunnies.  Similarly, most of the top shelf liquor bottles were enveloped in dusty under usage, and the mirrors in the back bar were cloudy and dull.  I began to wonder how clean the kitchen really was and if I was going to regret what I ate.

Like a previous reviewer, I agree with the \"Departed\" characters being at the bar.  Otherwise the place is plenty spacious, and there is adequate parking nearby.  In retrospect I think people go there because there is really very little choice in Matthews and it's better than nothing at all.  To top it off, I had to ask to have a TV tuned to the Sox game that day.

For my money in Matthews, check out John's Place, the bar half of Mario's Restaurant in Plantation Market."}
{"text":"Dear Bar Rescue and John Taffer, I've found your next victim. This place is heroine. The one star is strictly based off of location, which is on point.

We ordered a OMB on tap. It tasted like it has been sitting in a bathtub. Stick to the bottle selection, which is very limited and full of frat boy light beer. 

The food....wow?!?!! My uncle was fought in Korea. By his report, he ate far better i the trenches then what was feed to him at this place. Everything is greasy and super frozen. 

Wow. This place is bad. Bad beer. Really bad food. They call themselves a sports bar inspires by Boston. In my opinion, the only thing they successfully pull off from the Boston vibe is rude waiters."}
{"text":"Worst place in the area.  Terrible food, poorly maintained tap lines, and the worst service I have ever seen.  Throw a stone and you'll surely hit a better place to spend your time and money."}
{"text":"This is by far the best bar in Matthews!  It has more TV's than you can watch.. Every garme, of every sport can be found. The owner of Beantown is there all the time ensuring you feel welcomed. It's more like family when you come and really get to understand!"}
{"text":"If you come before 6pm, the appetizers are half off; however, when there is live entertainment, it's better to come later! All the wait staff is great and extremely welcoming! They all know my almost 2 yr old by name and make sure to come by to say hi. This is a place where everyone knows your name! We love it and frequent it weekly. Just come once, I promise you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Good place to have a drink with friends or meet new people. Can get kinda loud with the later night drinking crowd. Yeah, the food seems from frozen as listed in previous review."}
{"text":"So service was good.  Extensive menu.  Nice Bar area.  French Dip had excellent flavor but the meat was a little dry.  Love the thick fries!  Would come again!"}
{"text":"People. It's a dive bar. Get over it. It's meant to be what it is and as that it's perfect. Great potato skins and pickle chips. I love fancy places and I love dive bars. The thing to note about that is that I love many fancy places but I only love THIS dive bar locally. Get over it, chill out and have a good time."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me with this place?! The only nice person I've encountered is the blond bartender who works at night. Most of their waitresses are rude as hell and look like they just rolled out of bed. The food is mediocre and the place is just sticky. Slow service from monotone, apathetic women whose attitudes show that their management doesn't value customer service or care about the image their employees give off... I'm surprised this place has lasted this long."}
{"text":"Needs more Boston sports memorabilia!  That was a pretty half-hearted attempt.  A bit of '04 World Series stuff, but they really could stand to put a little more effort into it.  They don't need a mini Green Monster or their own parquet floor ... but would a Tom Brady jersey or Bobby Orr sweater really be that difficult to put up on the wall?

Decent bar menu, okay selection of beers (nothing special on either account, but if you can't find something that works you're being too picky, considering you walked into a tavern).  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere, and value for the money is excellent. It is a place you can go for a casual, sports-bar feel. Enjoy a game or just chat with friends. What I like about it is the sound level is just perfect so talking with others is still possible even when it is busy or the big game is going. 

I usually go for lunch and the ahi tuna salad is awesome. I have also had the strawberry spinach salad with grilled chicken and that is very good too. Lastly, for dinner I have had the BBQ and even though it is not your typical 'Southern' restaurant, they make a great BBQ sandwich."}
{"text":"The food is good. I assume it's a good place to grab a couple of drinks and a few burgers. I went with my family (4 adults and 2 toddlers). We all enjoyed the food, but my issue was with the service. Slow is not the word to best describe it. The waitress, hostess and server were all the same woman. We went Sunday at 3 pm and it wasn't overly busy; however, you would think she was serving a party of 50 all by herself. We never got our appetizers. She didn't respond to requests for drinks. When she did, drinks took FOREVER. I've been wanting to try this place for quite a long time, but it will be a while before I go back."}
{"text":"My first review of Beantown a few years ago wasn't very positive. I've been back a few times in the past couple months and sat in the bar area. Food was pretty good I have to say and the service has stepped up (at the bar, can't speak for the rest of the restaurant). The bartenders take care of their patrons."}
{"text":"AWESOME BREAKFAST!!! Seriously even though it's a bar/restaurant, I LOVE to come here for breakfast. It's absolutely delicious, the home fries are crispy and flavorful, the sausage tastes homemade, everything is consistent and filling for the price. I don't review much unless I feel it's necessary, and I feel it necessary to tell people to come here for breakfast! Also, our waitress was EXTREMELY nice, patient and helpful. The blonde lady at the bar, didn't catch her name but she was super sweet. Will keep coming back"}
{"text":"I am from Boston and I was hoping this place would remind of great service and good food up north. Sad to say it provided   Below average on the service scale and the food was below par. I emailed the owner and described my negative experience. He defended his food and service and never asked me any details on the experience. This place really sucks."}
{"text":"I love love love their food! Its delicious. They have a wide range of food and the price is well worth for the amount of food you get. When I was pregnant with my baby girl, this place was all I wanted! I've tried almost everything here except the pizzas and I was never disappointed... hmm I may go tomorrow! =]

I really love the atmosphere at this place and the people are very friendly! Which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"We ran into this place yesterday and we were really happy to find it!  It's a cute pub and they have live music on Saturdays.  We got some beers and wings.  The wings were delicious and the service was great as well."}
{"text":"I love the bar, I love the atmosphere.  I love the waitstaff and the people.

The food is not good.  I've tried it 3 times now, various dishes.  Unless you're getting a burger or something, there are better places to eat.

But like I said, I love coming here for the bar and it's always fun to come in for a pint!"}
{"text":"Awful service.  We went on a Sunday afternoon when the place was more than half empty.  Our table was dirty.  Waitress gave it a quick swipe, told her to clean it better.  We ordered two burgers, medium, one BBQ sandwich and one crab cake sandwich.  We waited over 20 minutes for the food, while watching the cook chatting with the waitress.  Both burgers came out well done and the sweet potato fries were burned.  We returned one burger (daughter was too hungry to wait for another) and then had to wait another 10 minutes for the new burger, which was still well done. Husband ate it anyway because at this point he was very hungry.   Apparently cook doesn't know how to cook anything else. When we complained to the waitress her answer was: I don't know what to tell you.  What would you like me to do?  My answer: I'd like to speak to manager.  Her answer: well, he's on vacation.  The bartender is running the place today. 
Well that explained a lot.  Will not be returning again."}
{"text":"You go here if you want bar food.  
Considering the number of new restaurants popping up in Matthews, they need to clean the place up.  Spend some money on the interior and update the tables and flooring.  
The reason we keep coming back is our server, Jamie...she's the best."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in and try Beantown on a Friday night. It's a casual sports bar. When we walked in, the hostess was gone and we didn't know if it was seat yourself or not. She eventually showed up and led us to our table. The server was polite but didn't know the beer menu that well (wasn't sure if they had PBR) a pretty common beverage don't ya think? The one good thing about the place is the food wasn't half bad, I built my own calzone which starts out at 10 dollars and 1.50 for each topping, a bit pricey for a plate of dough. At least it came out hot and it wasn't bad.

This place gets two stars because of the bad service. It wasn't crowded (for a Friday!) and our server just disappeared after our food came out. Saw her texting and just wasting time with other servers. It took about 15 minutes to get our check. When we eventually left, I spotted the hostess on the patio talking to a guy and not doing her job. Seems like the place needs better management. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Our table of seven enjoyed good food and great service. The music on the patio was a little loud, and it was somewhat difficult to converse. The overall atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"Our waitress simply seemed annoyed that we were there. We were a party of eight, so I can see how that would be difficult, but perhaps a smile?

In the bathroom, the statement, \"Blacks have rights...?\" Um...not sure WHAT that's about.

The food is...bar food. My expectations weren't high as bar food tends to be bar food...but how do you overcook frozen mini-corn dogs? Seriously.

Friend got a cheezeburger and said it was good. 

I will do my best to not frequent this establishment."}
{"text":"Food is awful and recently got busted for gambling in restaurant where they were gambling on where a pigeon would poop in the restaurant. Stay away"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting and join a Meetup group.  Realizing how crazy it must have been organizing the drinks, food orders and crowd, service was exceptional.  Food was fine too.  I had the chicken sandwich and fries."}
{"text":"We attempted to go to Beantown Tavern today to watch the Patriots/Dolphins game. We even called ahead to make sure they had the Patriots game on after reading reviews on Yelp. When we got there, they only had the Patriots game on in one room, they stated they would turn the game on in another room that had the Panthers game on 3! TV's. The staff failed to check with the patrons in that room, who refused to allow just 1 TV to be turned to the Patriots game (wait, isn't this supposed to be a Boston bar?!). We sat anyways, hoping after half time we could sneak into the \"Patriots room.\" Well, after waiting for over 20 minutes, seated at a table, multiple servers walked by us, looked right through us, and ignored us. At least 4 servers walked by our table, did not offer a hello, or even bring us water. After 20+ minutes of this nonsense, we left. Word to the wise, apparently Beantown Tavern doesn't need any business, so don't bother going. I'd give it 0 Stars but Yelp doesn't allow that."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today.  Thought the food was okay.  Nothing really special, but it was $5 for a burger on Sunday, so that is a good value.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Will definitely give it another try."}
{"text":"Before getting a coupon for Beantown Tavern, I had never heard of it.  It's not someplace anyone in my circle has ever talked about.  After looking up their website online, we decided to give it a shot. 

We got there early on a Saturday evening and it was already packed.  We even had to park quite a distance away down the small \"street.\"  Our wait thankfully wasn't too long; they have a lot of seating.   Being led into the restaurant and being seated, I looked around and thought, \"Wow.  My dad would love this place.\"  He's a huge Boston Red Sox fan and that's who this restaurant is dedicated to.  Red Sox memorabilia covers the walls and there are TVs showing the games.  

The menu took awhile to read.  It's pretty extensive.  There was page after page of sandwiches, salads, appetizers, entrees, pizzas, etc.  It's your traditional American fare, but a lot more choices than you see at other American restaurants.  The entrees (pasta, seafood, chicken, steak) seem a little on the highend for such a casual place, but the sandwiches and salads are very reasonably priced.  If you know me, you know I love spicy food, so naturally I went with the Buffalo Chicken sandwich.  It was spicy and gooey, dripping with hot sauce.  YUM.  The kids menu is pretty good here, too, and only about $3 a pop.  

All in all, Beantown Tavern was a nice casual place to go and hang out with your family or friends.  We had good service, good food, and enjoyed it in a casual and fun atmosphere.  Plus, you could return many times and never get the same thing twice.  If you're a fan of baseball or miss your hometown of Boston, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Good food, but not as atmospheric as the Matthews location.  This Beantown Tavern was one big open room with harsh lighting.  They had a LOT of televisions with a variety of sports options, but it felt \"unfinished\" restaurant-wise.  A tavern sounds \"homey,\" which this Beantown didn't feel. 

Atmosphere aside, I love the variety of food options they offer.  20 appetizer choices?  Wow.  The rest of the menu continues that variety, making it a tough call.  I went with the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which was very big and dripping with delicious hot sauce and blue cheese.  The fries they serve are very flavorful as well.  

So while the food at this location is a step above regular bar food, the atmosphere is severely lacking, making it not a good place for a \"night out.\""}
{"text":"Boring decor, the only outside seating is smoking, the beer list includes no local or craft brews whatsoever. 

The food was also a disappointment. We happened to come here on a day when burgers were half price, so we tried those. They were dry and very bland, both when it came to the meat and the extras. I am glad I only paid half price for this burger. The sides were also not spectacular, nothing seems to be house-made here, whether it's fries or condiments or whatever else. Not coming back, even on half price day."}
{"text":"My go-to bar! Great food, drinks, entertainment for the whole family! Must try wings or the homemade pizza! Live music every weekend."}
{"text":"Go on Tues night.  Full slab of fall off the bone baby back ribs.  Two sides.  A salad.    Wait for it......ten bucks.    Was very good and well worth the price.  Decent beer list decent apps list.   Would go back.  Fun place."}
{"text":"I always get the patty melt & sweet potato fries. Good patty melt but inconsistent sp fries. Friendly service. The owner is a big community supporter so I will keep supporting him."}
{"text":"I am from the Caribbean so my food has to taste seasoned.  The ribs were cooked to perfection however they did not taste seasoned! I am tempted to season some ribs and take it back to the chef and have them prepare it.  Then it would be perfect!"}
{"text":"This bar has a hometown local feel. Bar food is outstanding. Chicken nachos, lobster bisque, and their wings are my favorites. The lobster bisque has more lobster in it than you can imagine. Staff is friendly and hustles. Daily specials are amazing. Lots of local live music."}
{"text":"To me, this is a very comfortable place to hangout. Folks are nice, beer selection is good, live music on some nights and afternoons, dog friendly, they serve breakfast on weekends, and food / service is usually quite good."}
{"text":"The live music was great! But that's about it! Definitely nothing special about this bar. Charlotte/Mathews has alot more to offer than this place. The service was horrible..like your lucky to be in \"they're bar\" type situation. This staff didn't represent a Boston bar at all. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"This place serves up typical bar food and on my 2 visits, we had decent service.   If you happen to be in the neighborhood and are looking to grab a cold beer and a bite to eat, this is a pretty safe bet. 

Their menu is quite extensive and there is literally something on there for everyone.  If you are watching your budget, they have plenty of good options under $10. 

On my first visit, I decided to have a quesdilla (appetizer menu $9.95 w/chicken).  It was just fine - nothing out of the ordinary, but solid.  On my next visit I decided to go for the Salad with Ahi Tuna (also $9.95).  Again, it was good. 

I like the bar - it definitely has the feel of a typical tavern, and I suspect that if you're a sports fan, this is a great place to hang out and watch your fav game."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a light bite and a beer...and this is now Stadium Tavern.  Not a bad place to have a cold one while watching the game."}
{"text":"There are better places in Matthews that deserve your business. Don't go to Beantown Tavern.  The service is terrible. Food isn't good.  I wouldn't be surprised if this place ended up on Bar Rescue.  Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Beantown is your typical dive bar.  We enjoy going there, but it gets 4 from me.  Really should be more a 3 or 3.5, but we've gone too many times.  Usually busy on weekends. Interesting people watching.  Its not NY which is a huge plus. The food is average to even some below average, but good times and usually a band."}
{"text":"This place is a solid, \"OK\". 

The menu is way to extensive....nothing is really good...and, most of it looks like it was frozen and reheated.

One visit we had to move tables because the air conditioner was leaking and dripping on our table....I really thought that was gross. 

At the bar you will discover most of the extras from the movie \"The Departed\"....except I don't think they are acting.... I think they are placing bets, or are bookies, I don't know, but it was pretty mafia looking to me."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying I like the food and atmosphere at beantown. I'm a fan of the cheesesteak and l love all the sports. I went there with my girlfriend and friend. We sat down and soon after at 10:02 we're approached by the security guard (bald guy with tattoos). He came at us aggressively asking us for ID. I explained that both me and my friend are 22 and will both be drinking. My girlfriend is 20 but will not be drinking only eating food. He then said to \"get the **** out of the restaurant\". I explained that I am a regular and I don't understand why we have to leave. We were already seated.   He explained to me that it was the law. I told him that that was not true we go out frequently after 10 pm never with any problem. He said that in North Carolina restaurants are not allowed to have anyone under 21 in it after 10pm. We went to hickory tavern and were served without any problems. We also asked if it was a law and the waiter was like no not at all. I guess beantown doesn't want our business. Probably would have had a $60+ bill."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game. Yummy hamburgers and a fun atmosphere.  They also have some fab. live entertainment on the weekends and a nice patio."}
{"text":"I love this place!  We always come here to watch football.  The service is excellent!  Some of our favorites as the nachos, the fish sandwich,  and the shrimp cocktail!  They also have non-alcoholic beer which is hard to find at other bars.  Also a great place for breakfast, love the home fries!"}
{"text":"Walked in last night there were hardly any people in the restaurant at 7pm on Friday as soon as we were seated we could smell why. It smelled absolutely foul. I don't know what it was but it was just nasty we got up and left and won't be back!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time with friends for beer and appetizers. It was disappointing. Atmosphere was nothing like a Boston Tavern. The beer offerings are mediocre, again I expected more of a 'tavern'. Oddly they do not provide a beer list nor did the server help us understand the choices. Not a good first impression, so I will not go back."}
{"text":"I was in Matthews for a weekend training and the group went here afterward to chow down. there were about 14 of us and we were sat immediately on a Saturday night. Impressive. 

The menu is pretty big, with all sorts of options. Feel like Chicken Parm? Got it covered. Hamburgers? Yup. Quahog? Check. (That's giant clam that's been stuffed btw. Ya learn something every day.) 

I went with a simple cheeseburger. Thrilled I could add bacon, but bummed no guacamole. No avocados in North Carolina apparently. 

So I should have ordered the calzone. It was giant and looked amazing. Unfortunately I was stuck with my burger that was dry and well done. And no bacon. Given that overall the waitress was not that attentive, I ignored it. To the waitress' credit, we were a fairly large party, and in general, sort of obnoxious. Pretty sure she didn't come by that often as she was afraid we'd order more drinks. 

I honestly didn't notice this was a Boston or Red Sox themed restaurant. Maybe cuz I'm not from Boston and have only visited once, I didn't' pick up on it? I guess I assumed it was a generic sport-bar/restaurant because of all the TVs. It was fun to watch the last few clutch seconds of the Kansas game on the big screen. Until they lost. Totally F-d my bracket. 

Everyone seemed to enjoy their food and drink and it was a pleasant experience overall. It was all moderately priced and the environment definitely suited a group. Nothing stellar, but nothing awful either, again a nice variety at a good value, perfect if you need to feed several."}
{"text":"We LOVE their delicious soups. Great place for a late night snack. The atmosphere is friendly and the service is good. They have live music on Saturday nights."}
{"text":"I normally only post about places I like. That being said... don't waste your time or money in this hole. The food is mediocre, at best. The service is a joke. Staff spends most of their time texting or yapping with each other and the owner is a drunken mess. Someone should make a call to Bar Rescue."}
{"text":"Food is very bland and typical. I'd rather see a smaller menu with better and fresher ingredients. The beer menu was not actually a thing...and the waitress only offered us the specials nothing about what was on tap or in stock. Service was friendly enough but slow. Not somewhere I would frequent. And kind of disappointing since it carries the name of my stomping grounds"}
{"text":"The food and prices are mediocre however, the service is horrendous. Everyone who works there is either talking to each other or on their cell phones while ignoring you the whole time. The food almost always takes about 30 minutes to come out and is cold or not cooked properly.  Managers don't care about their customers and I've seen some questionable things in regard to sanitation."}
{"text":"I had the same experience as the Celtics fan below except my experience was during a Sox playoff game. The playoff game was on and about 1/3 of the way through the game they had a band come in and set up to play. How in the hell do you have a band playing in your restaurant during a SOX PLAYOFF GAME when you advertise yourself as a Boston sports bar?!?! About 10 Sox fans, including myself and my sister, got up and left. Waitstaff wasn't pleasant, beer was lukewarm, and the food was mediocre at best. I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Quick service. Gave ideas about what was good on the menu. We went for an early dinner. We heard later on that evening they had a great band that played."}
{"text":"Make that 3 1/2 starts with judicious choosing
To start with I decided to try this place out of pure perversion. I had just had some disappointing Marsala chicken at Fontanella and lousy Pork Marsala at Carrabas. So why not try it at a Boston pub? Ok the chicken breast was just meh, they don't know how to bread it and bake it like Fontanella does and the Marsala sauce was thin and again I could not taste prosciutto .... but the sauce tasted of Marsala wine and of Porcini mushrooms something that both previous eateries  failed at. Shame on them. 

The grilled fish is generous but ... not so great. Sorry. But blackened fish works fine, it's lightly blackened and doesn't overpower the taste of the fish. The cole slaw is delish, why serve such tiny portions?? It's just cabbage folks. The onion soup is very very good. Like most everywhere else they need to learn that the proper way to prepare it is with a large piece of French bread toasted first, then floating on top to present the cheese to the broiler. Au gratin is not melted cheese floating about. Aside from that it was I said great. Burgers are pretty good although the chuck is a little greasy. 

Tuesday special is a half price rack of ribs with fries($10) Killer deal, the meat was moist and fall off the bone. The sauce didn't win any competitions but was perfectly suitable for the job. Not sure if it was Wednesday but the special was pulled pork with beans for $7,95 and again it was really good and plentiful both.

For my money I'll pass on the more expensive dishes but if you KISS it's will be hard to go wrong. Given a choice I'd chose Tavern on the tracks but it's at the other end of town. Everything considered I'm happy having this joint as a neighborhood option."}
{"text":"What in the world is a Boston bar doing in these parts? Just went over here for the bar after some Thai across the street.  Bartenders are nice and even come around to your table.  A couple guys on guitar rocked it out and were surprisingly not bad; rocking out the 90s tunes.  Met a few interesting characters roaming around, like the really old guy who yelled \"Just shut up and give me my drink\" extremely loud and seriously to the bartender.  A cultural experience.  After I have no idea how many rounds I someone else closed my tab out for me so I had a minor panic attack the next day wondering what the damage was; logging in to online I banking I was delighted to see the smallest tab I've ever had for that many drinks.  I'm liking this town already.  I still don't get the Boston thing though."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a midafternoon lunch. My office is not far away. I have been to this restaurant once before about a year ago. It was not very good but I decided to give it a second chance. The only people in the place were regulars at the bar. The place wasn't clean and the table was sticky. The waitress was slow to respond even though she had no one else to serve. She was busy reading at the bar. We had potato soup, a grilled chicken salad, and fried pickles. The food was not fresh and tasted very bland. It is amazing this place stays open. I felt like I needed to shower after I left. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Wow, band start and our server left twenty minutes later.  If you want quality food and any service, AVOID.  You want a bar that is under staffed and has holes in the restroom walls, this is your spot.  Band was great"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good,  but we almost didn't try it because the place appears so rundown. The foyer/entryway is now more of a storeroom.  It used to be a lot \"neater\". Now, it looks more like a dive bar on a college campus.  Maybe that is the look they want.  
For a Friday night dinner, it sure wasn't crowded as we had our choice of seating.  The food is actually pretty good, service is adequate, beer is cold, and we will likely be back."}
{"text":"My wife ordered a bowl of lobster bisque. Let me describe to you what arrived. 

Something gelatinous and lumpy. I think she could turn her bowl upside down without loosing any. We couldn't identify any lobster meat. We even broadly widened our definition of lobster meat, but no. 

We asked the staff if it is aways very solid/gooey vs creamy/slightly thickened like bisque we are usually served and they said it was as we were served. Waitress could tell she was disappointed and took it off our bill without us asking. Note, our waitress was 5 stars start to finish.

I had the Boston cheesesteak. Unremarkable, but the au jus was good. 

Regular crowd seemed to love the place and seemed to be drinking and having genuine good fun but not eating much. So great place for them which is good for that crowd. 

The whole place smelled like smoking was still allowed."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first meal there and it was really good. Started with the jalapeno poppers stuffed with cheddar and fired pickles. Both were very good. The cheese in the poppers were stuffed with sharp cheddar which was a nice change from cream cheese. 

The night's special was fried chicken with real mash potatoes, green beans and gravy. All really good, and I had so much that I had to bring some home. All for $7.95. 

Their menu is vast though, with lots of sandwiches and appetizers. 

I would recommend it and plan on going back."}
{"text":"Waitresses sloppy and indifferent. As in rough. Clientele sad. As in drunk old men staggering around. Foul mouths everywhere, as in derogatory to women foul. Decor non existent. Food bleh. I remember going here years ago and it was kind of ok. Now it's just gross. Like crackhead gross."}
{"text":"Eight of us went to Beantown tonight for dinner.  We had a variety of items to eat: meat pizza, ham and cheese, Monte Carlo, chicken sandwich, soft tacos, salad, and a pasta dish.  Everyone thought that their choices were good ones, except the one with the pasta dish.  She thought that the pasta was over cooked.   My wife and I had the pizza and salad and we were pleased.  Service was good."}
{"text":"One of the worst bars/restaurants I been to in a long time.  The place was half full and the food took over an hour to be served.  We talking burgers and sandwiches, not any complicated.  The service was lousy, when you could finally place a drink order it took forever to get delivered.

Hate to see what service is like on a busy night!"}
{"text":"I've landed at Beantown a few times, always kind of by accident. I can't say that I'd ever go there on purpose, as there's not much that stands out about the place to me...but it's never let me down as a good, old bar.

I tried to see the symphony in the park in Matthews earlier this summer, and it started to rain before the show started. The friends I was with decided to try to wait it out at Beantown. We drank coffee at the bar and chatted until the weather made a firm decision in the rain direction. 

The servers are really nice, and the crowd is usually a little older. It's a weird older crowd, though...often quite drunk. I get the idea that it's the Matthews township's answer to the uptown yuppy bar. There's definitely a smaller town, lower key feeling here. 

The restaurant area is plenty big as well, so it's great for groups. I've been out with friends here a few times, and it's always pretty easy to get a large, roomy table. It's a great spot for watching ballgames if you must be subjected to such an activity..."}
{"text":"Our crew appreciates Beantown only because it's simple and cheap. Nothing is remarkable, save for an always present crowd no matter the time of day. With that said, downtown Matthews offers SO MUCH MORE... settling on Beantown is typically reserved as the very last alternative to any alternative plans. I find myself loving the environments and crowds at Carolina Beer Temple, Black Chicken Wine Cellar, and even Kristophers more and more.

Some things worth mentioning -- karaoke's relatively big here, well as live music; covered semi-outdoor seating available; classic arcade games & darts available; NO POOL TABLES; parking can seem impossible, but it's not... just park towards the rear of the building or nearer the library.

Rating specifics (i.e. 1-5, low-high)...
- Overall recommendation = 2.25
- Food taste and quality = 2 (extremely plain bar staples)
- Portion size = 2.25 (where's the generosity?!)
- Price = 2 (Carolina, Black Chicken & Kristophers are all a better value, least for drinks...)
- Atmosphere = 2.5
- General service = 1.75 (many times lacking)
- Waitstaff = 1.5 (general disinterested attitudes...)
- Location = 4.5"}
{"text":"This place rocks. I may be a little biased, because I am about to move to Boston. This restaurant is dedicated to the Red Sox. I found this while searching on Yelp for a new restaurant to try. The menu is huge, you can try some \"authentic Boston food\" if you'd like, but they also have other different things like hamburgers, ribs, and coconut shrimp. You'd probably find something you like even if you don't like seafood. 

The atmosphere is very nice, spacious but cozy at the same time. The people are nice and make you feel comfortable. It's a casual and laid-back place with several plasma TVs all around. My friends and I left when they started turning up the music at around 9pm, because I guess that's when the \"bar life\" wakes up. Fantastic hidden place in Matthews. I say give it a go!

One last thing: their sweet tea is fantastic."}
{"text":"Great wings and fun atmosphere!  Live band on Saturday, tons of tvs w football and great crowd."}
{"text":"A few friends (who waitress here) recommended me to Beantown and I was happily surprised.  Normally, you wouldn't find me in a bar full of Patriots fans, but this Boston themed bar had a good feel.  The owner, Donnie, actually approached my group of friends and asked us how everything was and if we were enjoying ourselves.  Of course I was!  

There was a live band covering old soul jams like Curtis Mayfield and Isley Brothers and doing a damn good job at it too!  I chatted with the band members during a set break and they explained that they were also in a gospel group together and then cordially invited me to join them for service at Ebenezer Baptist Church that Sunday.

I enjoyed the diversity of the crowd, old and young alike.  That is except for the fourty-something year old that had one too many Budweisers and a taste for younger men.  It was hilarious nonetheless and I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"A-OK.  Please have better beer selection, that's my biggest gripe for a place labeled 'Tavern'.  The food was ok, nothing great.  

Typical bar food grub.  My girlfriend ordered macaroni cheese and it was literally out of a Kraft box.  Her buffalo chicken though was pretty good, I must admit.

I'd come back simply because it seems like a good comfy spot to watch a game or two.  Good friendly service too."}
{"text":"*****updated***** this is a reply I got from the waitress I mentioned below.  Beantown is \"not for everyone\". She's got that right.  I'm guess the owner agrees ?

\"Nina K: For your information I wasn't texting/Drinking on my Job Duty (I sat down to wait for a beer,Thank you) Man up and ask for a Manger next time..Beantown is Not For EVERYONE so Beantown is Not for you guy!!!!
I didn't give yu guys bad service yesterday so idk why you guys took that shitt on me.\"



Wow.  Popped in today because we were looking for a late lunch.  Our biggest mistake was seating ourselves next to the most obnoxiously wasted and offensive person ever.  Heard all about how he cheats on his wife with strippers, and which ones \"swal*ow\".  He yelled \"I licked her v*****!!\" about a dozen times during our meal at 3:00 in the afternoon. I don't blame the restaurant for the customer's bad behavior, but the worst part was that I felt intimidated to make any comments to our server or the manager.  Apparently he is a regular because all of the waitresses were basically sitting in his lap or rubbing his shoulders and laughing with him.  We had to get up and look around for our server to get the check, and she was sitting at the bar texting.  When we got up, the guy pointed at my fiancé and said \"look at that guy!  He only has one ball!\"  Ok? Trashy place with scum of the earth staff and customers."}
{"text":"Literally the worst place I've been to in Charlotte. Save your time and money.  It took over AN HOUR to get our food from our Princess waitress. Like other reviews said, you get the impression that you are bothering the waitstaff.  By far the worst waitstaff I've encountered. This place simply doesn't have ANY management oversight. If I could give it zero stars I would!"}
{"text":"Awesome fun place.  Cheers mixed with great sports fans and great food.  Everything from steaks to fish and chips to bar-style aps.  Anything you might want and all of it is great.  Live music, dart boards, lots of fun at a very affordable price."}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome, the chicken fingers are meh.. Too small of an order to be satisfied, just FYI for all you fat bodies out there.  Waitresses are ALWAYS nice as can be and damn hot!  Every time I go there there's just hot waitresses everywhere and they're fast too.  Bartenders are great, quick.  All around decent little joint.."}
{"text":"Large menu, small bar area but the owner really seems to appreciate his patrons.  Yesterday was their 5yr anniversary and EVERYTHING was 1/2 off.  That included adult beverages.  At one point, he even bought everyone a shot of their choice.

To piggy back off of my first review, I was here Super Bowl afternoon, they had free roasted pig for the patrons with fixins for as long as it lasted. I also witnessed the owner drive a drunk customer home and then walk back. Got to appreciate owners who take care of their clientele."}
{"text":"Took 15 mins to get a drink ... waitress never came back to get a good order ... the beer from the tap is skunked ... the best pet of the night is the band"}
{"text":"The vibe I got here was just strange.  It's a bar and there's really nothing fancy about it but we were put in the back room which was just odd in decor.  There were antique-style chandeliers and light fixtures that seemed out of place for a sports bar.  There was art on one wall and a wall of sports plaques.  The decor just didn't go together.  But maybe that's out they do things in Boston, which is the teams that this bar caters to,

My first disappointment came with the beer selection.  Not a single craft beer in this place.  I guess they haven't heard about the local trend to serve craft beers and haven't heard how popular some of the NC beers are.

My 2nd disappointment with this place is the appetizer menu.  We ordered several plates of many different appetizers and all of them seemed like they were right out of a box from the freezer.  Nothing stood out.  The potato skins looked like Ore-ida,  The nachos barely had any cheese on them and the fried pickles were some of the worst I've ever had.  

Friends of mine had salads, one with seared Tuna, spinnach and fruit which looked good but that was the only thing in this place that impressed me.   

Being that I rarely get to Matthews, I doubt I will be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Lunch July 8 
  Group of 6 for lunch.
  Wide variety of sandwiches and lunch entrees & salads. Food comes out quickly and no one had any complaints.
  I had the \"Hot Ham & Cheese Sandwich\" - it was on a grilled bun and had cheddar cheese (wish it would of had Swiss & on sour dough or anything but a bun).
  Everyone enjoyed the \"French Dip\" Sandwiches.
  This place did pretty standard lunch fare and it did the job, nothing spectacular.
  Tons of New England Pats & other Boston Team decorations - hey it is called \"Beantown\"!"}
{"text":"Customer service rates a 0. Bar tender was extremely rude. Just because my husband fell asleep at the bar she basically threw us out. He had a long day at work and was very tired. Right before we left she jerked my glass of wine that I had out of my hand. I had al ready paid for it and demanded we leave the facility. We were not obnoxious or making a scene. Will NEVER come back to this establishment again."}
{"text":"There are certain times in your life when you really crave trashy bar food. However, if you experience that while in the Matthews area, turn around and get the hell away from this bar. 

I stumbled in, maybe a little buzzed from Carolina Beer Temple (don't you judge me) and ready to eat something really bad for me. So what if the Yelp reviews of this place made it sound horrible? How bad can bar food be, I thought?

THE ANSWER IS REALLY PRETTY BAD. 

The inside is charmingly gray. It looks like you're eating in someone's garage, maybe in the Soviet Bloc. Of course, the garish TVs all over the wall didn't add much to the ambiance. 

Slowwww start to get service. We even questioned leaving, which in retrospect would have been the better choice. Our table was pleasantly sticky, which really heightened the mood. Started with potato skins. No real way to mess those up, so those were fine. I mean, I could've eaten the frozen boxed ones from TGI Friday's and had the same taste. 

We skipped cocktails because they all used weird discount no-name brands and I didn't want a sugary alcohol hangover the next day. 

Our waitress disappeared for what seemed like an eternity and then took our order. The Buffalo chicken sandwich was mediocre. Fries could've definitely been hotter and less limp. The nachos...wow, I don't know what the \"queso\" was made from, and maybe I don't want to know. I think I ate three chips before giving up. It looked like a plate of sadness. 

Waitress just never checked on us the whole time, and we had to flag her down to get our bill. I don't think she was very busy seeing as how there were maybe five other tables and several other waitresses. 

I get the impression everyone just kinda gave up on this bar. 

This morning has brought me a cavalcade of tummy troubles. I regret everything. 

In conclusion, listen to the reviews. I wish we had!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst!!!! We were soooo disappointed, more like heart broken. 
We are from New England and we heard this restaurant was the place to be, being Patriots fans and die heart redsoxs fans.. We couldn't wait to go to this place, and here it goes:
Walked in and the hostes asked if it was just the two of us, then she said just sit anywhere, so we walk  inside and there is a bunch of tables in the center, no order, more like just there, so many chairs all around no possible way to get to the tables. Plan B -Booths,  we turned and almost every booth is dirty w food and leftovers, a couple is sitting in one of them and looked like finishing. Ok then lets look at the bar.... packed with what looked like wayyy too drunk to be there middle aged men no room there! 
Lets go outside blah... smokers all around tables dirty, ok back in, now we are looking at each other not knowing what to do, the waitresses walking by us made us feel like we were on their way, not once looked at us or offered help, We see the couple that just left and a waitress trying to clean the table (not succeeding) we sit there and wait .....and wait....While waiting a drunk man walked in, all beat up asking for a woman that works there  about 3 waitresses answering all his questions, then he leaves they all start talking to each other ....Hellloooooo we are right there next to you literally staring ...nope they left.  15 minutes of waiting we looked at each other and without a word walked out, the hostes too busy on her cell to even noticed that we walked out.
Now why one star?  Because i had to put one to write this. Needless to say,  we will never go back."}
{"text":"This hometown tavern is my favorite breakfast. Donnie's breakfast menu is so easy... There is never any waitress confusion with your order. Just check a box on the menu and your order is off to the kitchen. Ease on back and watch any of a dozen channels or glance at the morning papers that are always available. Next think you know poof!!! There it is... exactly what you ordered to start your day. Best kept secret in the historic downtown. You can even write in Neese's Country Scrapple and cheese grits..... Try that anywhere else. Great friendly service and value."}
{"text":"Another of the (seemingly endless) places tucked back into Matthews Station, this one is something of a sports bar/casual dining establishment., and to say that there isn't anything fancy about the place is a stretch. It's almost as if they just ran out of money when moving in so they stopped decorating. Heck, it looks as if they just stopped finishing the walls.

That said, the staff is generally welcoming, and the menu has some solid variety, but they are a bit on the slow side. Once delivered, however, the food was reasonable, but nothing stellar. Don't know if it is worth another visit or particularly memorable, however."}
{"text":"We typically come to Beantown Tavern every week. We know a couple of the servers, if they aren't there than the second isn't good at all. Overall the food is good. Beer, your usual domestic and a couple imports, no real craft selection. The building is rundown and could you maintenance for sure. They have plenty of TVs for your sports viewing and over if you need a place to dunno and hang out. Beantown is your spot."}
{"text":"The ribs were okay. Nothing extraordinary the table did not have extra barbecue sauce and the waitress never came around to ask us if we wanted more. The ribs were only sauced on one side. The good thing is they were half-price but even at eight dollars and $11 for a half and full size orders, I would have been disturbed paying the full price for the orders we received. The two dollars Bluemoon special was about the best thing that happened. They did cook the broccoli to my liking and a baked potato was not half bad. The salad was nothing special either but it was enjoyable. Overall not bad barfood. We actually came here to test the ribs so that we can order catering for our wedding party. It appears that we shall meander on down the road and check out Moes barbecue right down the street. To be fair we did have a decent meal for $27 including the tip. Be aware it is a monument to the Boston Red Sox and we are Yankee fans so that's why we only gave it two stars."}
{"text":"Service was slow, food was avg. I bought the mushroom/swiss burger and it was ok . ... there were 3 drunk loud obnoxious old men who should have been cut off .. They were the reason for the short visit. Good specials on drinks."}
{"text":"Decent place to grab a drink and watch a game. Drink specials every night. The bartender was friendly and after a few rounds, attentive. My husband got a burger and I got a chicken sandwich, both meals were average but definitely on the expensive side. The beer selection is poor and they have no local brews on draft, that was disappointing. Great place to people watch especially when there is karaoke going on. The highlight of my evening! We will go back to have a few beers and watch the karaoke peeps but will eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pro: downtown Matthews, tons of TVs with as many different games on, good variety of eats
Cons: porch is for smokers and non, so non smokers either suffer or stay indoors; food quality is meh - basic bar food; inside needs a serious scrub down"}
{"text":"LOVE this place for a few reasons. The food is good (not upscale but good, esp. for a \"sports bar\" type eatery). I LOVE the patio. I take my kids here often and we can watch whatever favorite sport that happens to be on. Great \"local\" feel. My 10-year old and I enjoyed our lunch yesterday here on the patio. Very kind and attentive server, and the food really was good (daughter and I split a dinner entree). Live music on the patio to boot (this was around 2 or so on a Saturday). 

I've also been here with friends, esp, when a certain band is performing here. Waitstaff is great. Acoustics are great for the band(s). It does not feel like your typical bar (hole in the wall). Really a nice place to rock out with your friends or just take your family. 

PS: Not a Redsocks fan, but I still love it here. :)"}
{"text":"The live music was good, & I always appreciate a strong drink. The ahi tuna was over cooked, but it's a bar soooooo."}
{"text":"Food was great. ......sadly the waitresses we're not professional. One in particular was disgusting.  I witnessed her multiple times grab a slice of pizza from the line go to the back eat come back chewing and wiping crumbs off of her hands as she began to roll silverware.  Then I heard her at least 4 times say she did not have time to go home this morning to shower before work, and asking co workers is she smelled bad but it should be ok because at least she put on deodorant.  I would eat the food again but only carry out.  I'm in restaurant management and this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"We just enjoyed a great \"clam bake\" on the house! Andoille sausage (sp?), shrimp, clams, bread, corn on the cob, and different sauces. We were (see my review) at the Matthews Library, in the middle of town  and were \"drawn\" into the tavern for a beer. What a great surprise! I guess they do this before winter hits."}
{"text":"A more apt title is BS Tavern. I didn't read the Yelp reviews as I normally do and went just based on the radio ads which make this sound like a vibrant hot spot where you watch your Boston sports (not just the Red Sox).  Instead it's just a dive where locals hang out for cheap beer.
Full story.  Being a Celtics fan I thought it would be cool to watch a playoff game in a Boston themed bar.  And while they did have the game on, it wasn't even on the biggest TV and some golf was on as many as of the TVs.  I suspect they just leave the TVs on certain channels all the time and only change them if somebody requests it.  If its just another regular season game I would understand but playoffs should warrant special attention.  And while I understand many people probably could have cared less about the game, if you're representing yourself as a Boston sports bar then that's what you have to be.  That way when a fan like me shows up he isn't in for a big letdown.  Same way you wouldn't have a country western bar and be playing Katy Perry all night.  
Another thing is I've never been to a bar where's its so difficult to get to the bar area.  As in getting to the bar seats you have to maneuver yourself awkwardly around tables and chairs.  Same thing goes for the bathroom.  Isn't this some kind of a fire hazard?  If say a fire did ever break out in the kitchen I imagine there would be a bit of chaos trying to exit safely.  
In fairness I will admit that yes the beer was cheap, service at the bar was okay (didn't bother to try the food).  But still the one star applies for misrepresenting itself.  I went to school around Boston and know what the taverns like there are like.  And you are no Beantown Tavern.  Heck the Boston Market up the road is more Boston than you are.  You're just a cramped dive bar with a few Red Sox signs on the wall.  And there's nothing wrong with that...just stop pretending you're something you're not.   Maybe just shorten the name to the \"Town Tavern\". While I realize my experience is unique, it sounds like lots of other people have had their own story of this place being wicked bad."}
{"text":"They have a variety of food at this restaurant, pizza, pasta, calzones, wings and other bar foods.  A very large selection to choose from!  The beer selection, however, is lacking.  They do not have local beers to offer, except maybe one at a time, which is pretty disappointing.  The service is very slow.  The waitress pretty much ignored all of our signs that we were ready to order and made us wait at least 15 min to even come to see if we had questions.  After getting the food, she didn't come back to check on us.  I only got mozzarella sticks this time, which were fine.  My friends ordered sandwiches and fries which we cold and not fresh.  The service just needs to improve, it was not a busy Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great atmosphere of a hometown kind of feel. Half off on wings on Mondays and Half off on baby back ribs on Tuesday are my two suggestions anyone considering going here. Ask for Hannah she will take good care of you."}
{"text":"I was here recently over the Thanksgiving holiday with my brother and friends. We only drank, didn't eat. For what we went for it's A-OK! They have a nice outdoor area with lots of TVs to watch the games. Even more around the bar area. The bar area does need to be a little bigger but it gives off a smaller, intimate feel. We were there on a Saturday afternoon and the bar area was packed with local patrons. One of the new additions to this place is Keno (gambling game). I wasn't familiar with it but my brother, who lives in Ohio, was and taught me how to play...and lose. That's ok, it was still fun. Located in the heart of Matthews, I'll be back around to this place!"}
{"text":"A great burger  and on special on Sunday.
A great deal for the family after church but you have to remember that it is a bar and full of New England fans so it is loud.
Recommend the French dip with crispy fries.
Service varies, sometimes good sometimes not. The younger wait staff sometimes is networking to hard to do a competent job, recommend take out.
If you are into sports, it is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"My favorite bar! Great Long Island's, great staff. Burgers are good too and daily specials."}
{"text":"This is the worst representation of Boston I have ever seen. Bad service, bad food, bad experience. If I posted pictures of the food you would be sick to your stomach. DO NOT COME HERE!"}
{"text":"We had a great time here.  Bartender was phenomenal.  As we left, a person threw empty bottles at us!  Management took up for this guy (We think, It could be a female.).  This man/woman slung beer bottles at me.  I have a video."}
{"text":"As a Patriots fan, this is a great bar for me to watch football at. Owned by a New England native, it's the only Boston bar in the area that I know of. 

They have cheap beer options and the food is pretty good--the pizza is the best option on the menu. It's super cheap for the size of the pie and it tastes great.

We've had some issues in the past with the rowdy crowd the bar attracts at night, it is much more a bar than a restaurant so I wouldn't recommend it for a quiet dinner or anything like that. But if you're looking to drink a cheap beer and watch football, go for it!"}
{"text":"We ate there for lunch today. Not bad. French dip and wings (half off special today) were fine. Not mind-blowing but a nice lunch at a fair price. Service was great. Only minor complaint was the door to the patio closed very slowly and there was a serious draft where we sat. 

I also like they have Coca Cola products, but that is just me."}
{"text":"Really want to give this place more stars since it's in Matthews (plus+) and has a lot of potential.  Great location, extensive menu, and good food... it was just the service that really brought it down for me.  The servers and hostess are in regular clothes so it feel like they just rolled out of bed and it was hard to distinguish who was there to eat and who was working.  Our server, though pretty nice, took FOREVER to get to us.... granted we had the time to spare, but when you find yourself staring at a wall mural for a good 10min when you are ready to order... doesn't really put me in a good mood.

The bar looks like a fun place to hang out and watch games at... there is also a nice patio that we couldn't help but notice since we were seated right near the door and a rush of humid sticky air would rush in every time the door opened and closed.  Great thing the people on the patio were drinking profusely and had to frequent the bathroom more times than a normal person....

I'll definitely give this place another try since my roasted chicken ravioli really saved the day in taste and filling-ness."}
