{"text":"Comparing it to all other buffets I have been to, the quality of food is a notch or two above average.  Value is probably one of the best I've seen.  Selection was numerous and they also had a sign that they would prepare anything fresh for you upon request.  I was more than satisfied after I left and would return when I'm back in the area again.  The one star off is that the dining area was not the most clean, but they did what they could and it was ok."}
{"text":"Not good. I always like to try Asian restaurants when I travel for work, so I stopped here on my way through town. I should have kept going. I got there around 12:15 and there were 3 other customers. Despite this, all of the entrees on the buffet were picked over and just about empty. The food was not good, and I almost had to spit out a particularly fatty piece of what was supposed to be chicken. The crab rangoon and egg rolls were just okay. Somehow multiple things from the buffet were cold. Gross. As I write this I am actually hoping I don't get sick later.   As far as cleanliness the dining area was clean but the rest of the place was pretty dingy. The bathroom was clean enough.   The price was dirt cheap but I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"My family and I went and had the buffet during dinner time. We enjoyed it. They had the normal assortment of Asian buffet items that you would see on a buffet like this. The food was very good and fresh. They also had soft serve ice cream..however, no salad bar."}
{"text":"Had the buffet. It was good, typical Chinese food buffet. It was clean but nothing fancy. Will try it again."}
