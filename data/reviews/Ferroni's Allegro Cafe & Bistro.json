{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Middlefield is Amish country, but this coffee shop definitely has used the country feel to it's advantage. The deserts are superb and the coffee is great as well. One thing that makes the coffee great is the prices, for a large latte you'd be looking at $4. 

Another great thing about this coffee shop is the atmosphere. With this place basically being a remodeled two story home, there are plenty of spaces to sit down and curl up with a good book. There are two full rooms upstairs. One with a couple of couches and the other with a large table where a couple people can meet. Great place and great coffee."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why Yelp hasn't counted any of the other reviews on this place. (The other reviews are hidden). They seemed perfectly suitable and you should read them too.

I went to Ferroni's for the first time today. I just moved out to the area after working as a barista for the last three years in California. I wasn't expecting to find many quality coffee options in a small town like Middlefield. But the drink selection is fantastic and the quality is equally so. The tea selection is also high quality and my happens to be my personal favorite brand (Harney and Sons).

The food was fresh, delicious, and super cheap as well ($4 for a panini and chips). 

The ambience feels like going home to grandma's house, in the best way. It has the feel of an old-timey country cottage with rustic wooden furniture, charming upstairs seating, and a smattering of antiques.

I really recommend it. This and Vinny's have quickly become my go-to spots in Middlefield."}

{"text":"Middlefield, Ohio is Amish country but this shop has a surprisingly superior West Coast coffee quality. And the breakfast and lunch items are superb. I can't imagine you'd find better coffee or coffee shop food anywhere for miles."}
