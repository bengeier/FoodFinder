{"text":"My tea was the only thing good and it was hot water with a Lipton pack tossed on the table. These sandwiches could be so awesome. The fries on the sandwich were soggy and tasted like old grease. The cold slaw was similar to sauerkraut with a strange tangy flavor. I ordered the fish sandwich which was the size of a deck of cards hidden under fries and slaw and one and a half inch thick bread and was not seasoned. Separately all pieces were mediocre at best. But for the price, the two stars is for the waiter who was funny. And the food will fill you up but you won't be bragging to your friends about it. I guess coming from the south my expectations are high on quality tasty food. But this place I'd suggest you'd skip."}
{"text":"The pitts burger is my favorite! It makes my mouth water everyone! Great service here the staff is great and friendly. Can be slow at times"}
{"text":"Though Primanti Brothers is really good, it is not as good at the stadium.  I tried it IN the stadium and OUTSIDE the stadium at one of their regular locations and there definitely was a difference.  You get more and pay less at the outside locations and inside PNC, you get less and pay more.  So next time I am in town, I will definitely get one outside the ballpark so I can get more for my money."}
{"text":"Absolutely no flavor. Needed at least some salt. Will never repeat. Sad in Pittsburgh :("}
{"text":"***The good thing about the concessions at PNC Park is that they feature local brands/products like Primanti Brothers; the bad thing (and definitely not surprising) is that the ballpark version of Primanti Brothers is probably not a good representation of their food***  I have never been to an actual Primanti Brothers location, but I've heard of it.  This Primanti Brothers location is inside PNC Park and it features a limited menu (a few sandwiches and their fries).  The sandwiches are served on thick bread and topped with French fries.  I ordered some of their French fries as a side.  They were freshly cut, but the fries had been sitting around for a while.  Some of the fries were crisp, but most of them were limp, soggy and cold (they were also quite greasy).  With the skin on and everything, the fries might capture the great and guilty pleasure experience of carnival fries when they are served just out of the fryer.  But given that the fries are so unevenly cut here, you still may not get consistently great fries with one order (even when they are hot and fresh).  Cheese dip is also available for an extra charge.  The cheese dip was the standard cheese dip you get with stadium nachos.  The fries were expensive, but I did purchase them at a ballpark and the portion size was generous.  Service was fine and quick.  Since ballpark food often sits around (I had a similar experience with garlic fries at AT&T Park in San Francisco), PNC Park is probably not the best location to try Primanti Brothers.  The fact that Primanti Brothers is a local product might make you consider giving it a try over other generic concession food at PNC Park.  That being said, PNC Park seems to feature a lot of local food so you may want to explore the park a little before committing to Primanti Brothers (or at the very least, you should request the staff to serve you a fresh batch of food).  Primanti Brothers is located within the stadium so it is only for ticket owners.  There are several parking lots and structures nearby.  The lot right next to PNC Park is $25, but a structure just one block over is only $15."}
{"text":"First of all, Im from the Bay Area, so we don't have Prim Bros out there.  I had Prim Bros for the first time on the Southside. My buddies took me there and it was amazing!  Then I checked out the Prim Bros at the game. Still delicious, wasn't as fresh, it was kept under a heater... but damn it beat eating a regular ol' hot dog!  I'd take a ballpark Prim Bros Cap and Cheese now whenever I go to the Giants game over anything there!"}
{"text":"There was four of us that ordered different sandwiches for dinner and all enjoyed their food. The sandwiches were large enough to split. The outdoor seating is pretty cool too because you can see the activities of the square. They also have enough TVs to watch your favorite game."}
{"text":"Man, I'm so disappointed with this place. I'm in the midst of a stadium tour and I've heard that Primanti's is THE staple of Pittsburgh. Either I was lied to or these guys just had a bad night. I hate to say it, but I actually think this was one of the WORST sandwiches I've ever had. I should have taken the absolute lack of line as a sign, ESPECIALLY since the stadium was PACKED on a beautiful night AND there were 20 minute minimum waits at the other restaurants .   I had the Pittsburger (not sure if I'm spelling that right). It was delivered quickly, which is the only positive thing I could say about the sandwich. The meat tastes like it was out of the freezer and also had a rubbery texture. There was no flavor either. Would salt and pepper hurt? Even worse, the pull of the whole sandwich is that it is supposed to be stuffed with fries. Ummmm, not only were there like maybe three fries in the whole sandwich, the fries were soggy and not seasoned. For all visitors, don't waste your time here. Check out the many other winners.   Oh well, the rest of my experience at the park was stellar. End rant."}
{"text":"Don had the chili, I had a roast beef sandwich that was mainly bread, coleslaw and fries. still tasty though. Bathroom was a disaster; no soap or paper towels. ewww"}
{"text":"I finally received a call today after my complaint on Friday night that I had submitted online with Primanti Bros... the lady could not have been nicer and more apologetic about the incident understanding my dietary restrictions.  She said she will mail me some gift cards (totally unexpected).  Once they arrive, and I go to a Primati's and use them on a Sandwich with NO CHEESE, I may update this even again!"}
{"text":"Next time I'm going to be sure to eat a full-sized dinner before coming. I totally understand ball park food is overpriced, but I paid $6 for fries in a little cup. At the regular primanti's you get a nice amount of fries (for $3) Also, they werent hot at all and the only option for cheese was on the side. ($1.50)"}
{"text":"I was looking for that Pittsburgh experience... Pirates game and a Primanti Brothers sandwich. The Pirates got shut out and my sandwich left me disappointing as well. I KNOW ballpark food is overpriced and not the same. I get the gimmick that the sandwich is stuffed with coleslaw and fries. Interesting and worth a try, but not something I will try again. Next time I will get a sausage or brisket."}
{"text":"Very dissapointing, i love the original Primanti Bros, but the booth at PNC park is not in the same league, i suppose the sandwiches are bulk made & kept under a heater, just not that great, but stilll better than average ballpark fare..... Served with IC lite, possibly the worst beer in America."}
{"text":"Not quite as superb as the stand-alone restaurants [http://www.yelp.com/biz/primanti-brothers-pittsburgh#hrid:C30sebXtI6ykCBDwI0b1ew], but that shouldn't be a surprise. The cheesesteak felt like it had been made an hour earlier and partially re-heated, but still tasted like you hope it should. And it certainly beats your other options at the ballpark-- lukewarm frankfurter, anyone?"}
{"text":"I must of had the wrong sandwhich...I had the traditional Primanti with steak coleslaw and fries and I thought it was dry  a dry as can be.   The woman at the counter was very nice but sorry I wasn't inpressed.  Sorry"}
{"text":"Absolutely great food. When you go to the park hot dog and burgers are great but a good ol promanti bro sandwich is another great Pittsburgh option"}
