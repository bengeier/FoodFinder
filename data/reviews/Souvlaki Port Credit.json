{"text":"I want to like this place ... I really do. It's closer to me than the competition down the street. I didn't realize that it's not a full service restaurant. You order at the cash and sit down but they do serve the food to you. It was actually busier than I thought with a lot of take out traffic every five to ten minutes. The food was tasty but the portions were average. Tzatziki was a bit softer than I like or am used to. The washroom was out of service temporarily which was highly untimely for us ... perhaps that really put a damper on the whole experience.  As someone else mentioned, they do give you honey sticks ... deep fried pita smothered in honey ... delicious!  And this comment is highly subjective but it's not very child friendly as they don't have any high chairs. This is probably a non-issue for most Yelpers but for us, it'll be difficult to come back since there are so many others in the neighbourhood that are much more accomodating to children who need booster chairs or high chairs."}
{"text":"I tried Souvlaki Port Credit at 50% off thanks to a just-eats coupon tonight, and while I hate to say this, it feels like even at half price, I paid far too much.  I ordered the grilled octopus dinner, chicken souvlaki dinner, and a \"side\" of grilled calamari.  I was a little nervous about the octopus, given its $18 price, but I figured at half price, I could take the risk.  Chicken is one of the basic souvlaki types out there, and every Mr. Greek and Zet's does an acceptable version, so this was my \"can't-go-wrong-with-it\" order.  The calamari was ordered just to indulge in seafood, which I absolute love.  The chicken souvlaki was reasonably moist and tender, similar in many respects to Mr. Greek's version.  The latter is more seasoned (a good thing), and both are acceptable in portion size.  The chicken appears to be marinated/tenderized.  Souvlaki Port Credit provides Greek salads that too are similar to Mr. Greek's.  I found the rice to be a little on the soft and mushy side, but decent enough.  The potatoes were quite a bit of a letdown.  I've come across Greek restaurants that make potatoes that will move you, just perfectly seasoned and moist.  I love the way my knife/fork slides through perfectly moist potatoes and sadly, these guys totally missed the mark on seasoning and texture.    Our salads were inconsistent.  Hers had a lot of feta and adequate dressing, mine had less and nearly no dressing.  The calamari was cooked nearly perfectly, no signs of rubberiness or overcooking at all.  I could taste the grill, but it was masked with a bit of a watery sauce which wasn't a great addition.  I was not a fan of the seasoning here, but that's more my taste than them not doing it well.  The texture was pleasing enough that I finished this completely, and it was clear that these weren't rings out of a frozen bag, since they had only cut the rings about 80%, so you could see the body of the squid.    There was another reason I finished the calamari in its entirety.  The highlight of the night - the octopus, was not just a letdown, it ruined my meal, my mood and if I hadn't had octopus before, I would wonder why people even eat octopus.  Now I realize octopus is not that easy to cook right, but hey, it's on their menu, and they charge good money for it.  It should be edible.  It wasn't.  It was so beyond overcooked that I'm going to make a sweeping statement here and say:  \"It was the most overcooked piece of seafood I have ever had or seen, ever, anywhere.\"    Towards the end of the tentacles, my butter knife was not able to make it through (seriously).  Caveman genes reared their head, and I grabbed the piece with my bare hands and tried to take a shark bite out of it, but alas, I tugged and pulled to no avail.  All that resulted was a slight toothache from the general left side of my mouth.  That wasn't all... it also lacked seasoning.  Restaurants should keep in mind that coupons, Groupon and other such promotions often introduce customers to their restaurant and may either provide a paying customer for life, or exactly the opposite of that.  I will not be giving this restaurant another shot.  _________________________________________________________  UPDATE:  While I appreciate the response Andrew V., it seems you should check on your own promotions a bit.  Here is a link to the online bill that shows what I ordered, how much I paid and the 50% discount, as well as it being from Just-Eat.    http://geekliness.ca/wp-content/uploads/bill.png  About trying you again, I'll check with the missus!"}
{"text":"Quite expensive for what you get, but the quality of food is great. It's operated as a mostly takeout/counter-service greek restaurant. A souvlaki dinner will cost you about $20, which is quite expensive for the portion size you get.  The ingredient quality makes up for the high prices. Their greek salad is fantastic, with lots of feta and other toppings. Also they make their tzatziki sauce in-house from what I hear, it has a very \"different\" flavour compared to most commercial stuff. It's very good. My only issue is the quantity of meat that comes with a souvlaki dinner. There should be more than 3/4 chunks if i'm paying $24 with tax for a meal"}
{"text":"This is a frequent stop for my girl and myself when we are craving some greek. The chicken here is unbelievably good, cooked perfectly and juicy with lots of flavor. When I don't feel like the chicken, the gyro is an awesome substitute. My girlfriends favorite is the calamari salad. The flavor and texture of it is sublime. Their tzatziki is rich and creamy and compliments their proteins perfectly. We've also tried the spanikopita which was above average but nothing mind blowing. The servers are nearly always fantastic to deal with and friendly. Be sure to ask for some complimentary honey sticks to finish off the meal. I also choose to support this place over the 'other' chain shop down the street because I feel that supporting the local businesses you enjoy is very important!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was hot, fast and on point. That being said, their tzatziki is terrible! I can't get past it. Also, why are they using basmati rice. Change your tzatziki please! Then it's 5 stars all day!"}
{"text":"Spent ~ $20 on a gyro dinner for take out.   Meat was dry (maybe had been shaved earlier rather than when I ordered) and overly seasoned with salt. Did not include tzatziki or any greek sauces, so it was just a pretty dry and salty $20 meal. Got about 1/8 through it before throwing it out."}
{"text":"Greek take-out for the Canadian palate is not rocket science ... and yet this place can't get it right. Soggy, listless and oily salad is just sad. You know how there's a good kind of oily, as in a delicious vinaigrette made with quality olive oil & lemon, covering crispy lettuce? Well this ain't that.   The meat was dry, although it seemed to be seasoned fairly well. The rice and potatoes had the quality of day-old leftovers. Not horrendous, but certainly not good either.   The whole thing was just so mediocre and not fresh tasting. But the tzatziki sauce was nothing short of an abomination. It is over-cultured yogurt (read: too sour) and is missing the critical ingredients of garlic and cucumber!! Even without the cucumber, you can't skip the garlic. It's sacrilege and everyone knows it. How they are getting away with such an offence is incomprehensible.   So on that sour note, I recommend you avoid this place and spend your money elsewhere. They need to shape up and get the basics right. You'll get better Greek take-out at a food court."}
{"text":"My go-to take out place in port-credit. Cost is half decent and food is hot and made exactly how you want it. I have allergies and they always take their time to make sure i'm taken care of. The tzatziki is inconsistent though - sometimes it's amazing and sometimes it's just a container of yogurt.   Regardless, the rest of the food is on point - all the time!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to P.C. Souvlaki for a long time. A long, long time. Was present when they first opened, knew Andrew (the original owner) and his father, and remember a time before they switched out the pita bread for another brand (still hurting over that one).  Yet, it's still my go-to Greek restaurant in Mississauga. You can't get much better than an open-faced gyro with extra tzatziki and some sriracha sauce drizzled on top. Pure heaven, folks.  The restaurant's always had really good prices over the years, and though the dinners can be a bit expensive, the portion sizes are huge. You pretty much have to split a dinner between two people - scoops of rice, big salad, plenty of pita bread and (if you're lucky) you might even get some honey sticks on the house. The fact that they also have their liquor license and can serve beer during the day was a huge shock to my friends when they came along with me last week.  Yes, I will continue to shill for Souvlaki Port Credit until the day I die. Definitely a highly recommended restaurant."}
{"text":"Lamb.Cooked.Fresh.Any.Way...WAIT FOR IT..........................................You want it.    Got a bunch of stuff here for a small get together.  What I ordered for myself was a medium rare lamb salad.  It was pricey as it $13.99 for a salad, but it was damn good lamb!  It was moist and tender and had very good seasoning without overdoing it.  I'm trying to think back and it's probably either the best or the 2nd best lamb I've had. Probably 2nd best. The best was at a friend's wedding.    As for the salad - very good with fresh feta cheese.  So for food: 5/5  Service - I did takeout, but they were all friendly and good looking girls hehe.   A bit upset as they didn't take the Yelp offer, but hey, I got some good food, so I'm happy. 3.5/5  Atmosphere: this kind of confused me a bit.  I wasn't sure if it was fast food, casual or a sit down restaurant.  It was nice, but it was weird.  I think it's sort of like an upscale diner type atmosphere? I don't know.  But it was nice. 3/5.  Would I come back? You bet I.....WAIT FOR IT.................................WILL.    Sorry, too much How I Met Your Mother. :-)"}
{"text":"Couldn't fault this place.  Service was amazing, food portions are giant and great value for money.   AND they are currently waiting on approval of their liquor license.   Delicious!"}
{"text":"We stopped for dinner and had very tasty gyro dinners and a VERY small glass of wine.  I rate this so low because when we got the bill, each item was a dollar more expensive than the menu read.  When I asked, they said \"oh yes, our prices went up but we haven't re-printed the menus yet\".  I personally think it's a crime when you go to a resturant and are told you will be charged one price but are charged a higher price when you go to close the tab.  I was not impressed."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad but we ordered 2 large dinners and pop but were  refused tap water. Establishments that serve alcohol should serve water and it would be so petty to limit this to only those who buy alcohol. Very very petty and disappointing."}
{"text":"Great food, shawarma is pretty cheap and tasty. Enjoyed!   The server was VERY kind and helpful.  Pokemon stop outside."}
{"text":"So had to go try this place after reading the other reviews.  Honey sticks are amazing! Lamb and chicken cooked perfectly.  Only let down we're the potatoes.  Very large pieces not completely cooked through. Lots of paprika but not a lot of flavour.  Go for the salad and rice sides instead.  Super friendly staff and great value for the money.  Will definately go back."}
{"text":"We got the regular size and the large size chicken souvlaki dinners, both were fairly good but nothing spectacular. My problem with this place was 2 things. 1) They refused to give us a cup of water and then charged 2 dollars for a bottle of water. 2) The prices listed on the menu were less than what they charged us. Reading through the other reviews, its clear that this was an issue back in April as well which makes it ridiculous for why they haven't fixed the prices on the menu after 5 months! They should have at least given us a heads up while ordering."}
