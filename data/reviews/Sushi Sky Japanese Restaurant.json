{"text":"Yes it's cheap but you can tell the quality of food is not all that. I ordered the salmon teriyaki set with the dragon rolls. Salmon was okay, but required a bit more teriyaki sauce and the sushi was below average. The rolls were mostly rice which got us full quickly. Wouldn't recommend this place. Mehh."}
{"text":"I only ate there once but my experience was great. The seating amopshere waa great for chatting. I didn't have any sushi but I had the garlic muscles and squid. Both were amzing with great quality fish. I would go back in for the muscles. Service was also nice and fast"}
{"text":"Convenient location.

Great prices for lunch and dinner buffets - although there are not a lot of choices.

Quality of food is great."}
{"text":"my FAVORITE sushi place in the city. LOVE the dinner specials ( spicy tuna, california, soup, salad and four spring rolls for only 9.95....among about 5 other amazing dinner specials!) 

its cheap, they always give me a booth, good staff, FAST service. my favorite place to bring a date"}
{"text":"i wanted a cheap lunch and they answered :D
if you want a super cheap lunch (from 11:30-4) that includes makis then do come to Sushi Sky. I got the futo maki(4 pieces) + cali rolls(6 pieces) for only $4.99. The cali rolls were not bad but i could have done without the futos.

Service was ok, and to respond to the comment before, yes the servers do converse really loudly in Mandarin."}
{"text":"Service was fine during my visit. Sat in the very back and tea was still constantly refilled. They also can back to ask if we needed anything else like dessert , etc. food was decent, well priced and portions were fine."}
{"text":"A generic Japanese restaurant that does little to distinguish itself from the many others in Toronto, let alone on Yonge.  

Ordered the dinner bento takeout on a few occasions primarily for the convenient proximity to my apartment.  Every component - the teriyaki, tempura, rolls tasted like what they were supposed to taste like and nothing more.  

Service was always brisk and unsmiling, but not unfriendly."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable sushi-maki Japanese restaurant with an all-you-can-eat option for 21.99 $. Food is great and plentiful. Fast and reliable service by genuine Japanese waiters. They have wine by the half-liter pitcher for less than 10$ and free refills for green tea. All in all great taste without emptying your pocket. A stone throw from popular Marriott and Holiday Inn hotels on Yonge."}
{"text":"The food is ok. The service is really poor. Really long waiting time for our food and they forgot a lot of stuff we ordered. I even have to ask twice to get my bill. They seem don't care at all."}
{"text":"I did a takeout on a Sunday afternoon. I didn't find the fish to be particularly fresh, which is everything really when it comes to sashimi... even the ginger seemed to be dried out. Left me feeling a bit uncomfortable - I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"the worst! I work right by here so i popped in for quick take out. Service was FAST but that was about it. Ordered 14 pc sashimi and a spicy salmon roll with avocado. Got 3 pcs of salmon, 2 pcs of red tuna, 5 clam, and 3 octopus. Ripped off.  Got a spicy tuna roll instead of salmon with no avocado. Also bug in garnish. Terrible. Couldn't eat octopus or clam because it smelled so fishy."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today with my mom and my aunt. We ordered the gyoza and two age tofu orders as appetizers and three Vegetarian dinner combos. 

When the age tofu orders came we saw they had bonito flakes on top and were in some sort of fishy smelling sauce, even though it made no mention of it in the menu like at other places. 

My mom explained that we can't eat the bonito flakes because fish makes us very sick and that it wasn't labeled on the menu as containing fish. She then asked if we could have replacement orders (like other restaurants have done before).

 Instead of taking the order back he very rudely denied that it was bonito flakes and was completely vegetarian, even though it obviously had bonito flakes and the fishy odour of the sauce was overpowering everything else. Come on guy, we know what bonito flakes look like. 

We couldnt even pick them off because they stuck to the tofu from the sauce. Sure enough my mum and I both are barfing like crazy now. 

We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"have never eaten in the restaurant but the take-out has been great. 

they have lots of options - everyone at my workplace has been able to have what they want for a really reasonable price. this is our go-to place to order sushi/maki for sure!"}
{"text":"I used to come here frequently for a nice cheap dinner, as the rolls are quite tasty and the variety is good. The waiters would always allow me to substitute (as a vegetarian) vegetarian rolls in the bento combos instead of fish ones (and it makes sense... vegetables are cheaper anyway!). While there is a vegetarian bento combo, I love variety and don't want to get the same thing every time! 

Anyway, while I have always been pleased with this place, the last time I went the server (who was a young male) refused to allow me to substitute. When I told him that I had always substituted for this combo before, he told me that he could not substitute because \"if he did it for me he would have to do it all the time\". Ever since this, I have not returned to this place. It seems as if the service is hit-and-miss depending on the waiter (as every other time I've been here I've had absolutely no complaints), however I still refuse to return on principle."}
{"text":"I got rolls. They were small and were mostly rice with tiny pieces of tasteless salmon and red snapper. Not worth it."}
{"text":"This is my third sushi review today. Out of all the three I submitted, I ranked Raaw with five stars, Sushi Sky with four, and Sushi Club with three. All reviews are based on not only the quality of the food, but also the service.

 My order was the rainbow roll, which came with a miso soup. The portion was pretty generous, even though I was filled by the rice instead of the fish. I hate it when they stuff me with rice just cuz it's a lot cheaper than the fish and avocado. Nonetheless, the rice was sweet and sour, perfect to the taste. 

Moreover, the service was really mediocre. When my friend and I asked if we could get the 10% student discount advertised in the UofT Student Saver booklet, she immediately turned tense and asked for our student cards. Even after seeing our student cards, she seemed extremely unhappy about the discount and told us with a frown :\"I only give discounts to international students. Just a UofT card does not work for me. Next time, I will not give you discount\"  She made our dining experience preatty unpleasant. Afterall, a 10% discount wouldn't make her bankrupt."}
{"text":"This place is close to my office so I order take-out there twice a week and sometimes come there for lunch with friends. Their sushi is always fresh and the prices are very low. I wish they had a bit more variety, but overall it's a good value for money."}
{"text":"Pretty standard sushi restaurant. They recently underwent renovations and the interior is much nicer than it formally was. The fish is always fresh and sushi is always good. I've been about four times, service has and from fairly mediocre to excellent.

My favorite server was a Japanese woman who in the traditional Japanese style didn't charge me extra to add booze to my drink.

Fuck, it was like being in Tokyo again. Don't know if this is policy or not but I liked it.

Tip well ladies and gentlemen. Keep her generous."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places for sushi takeout. While I've heard mixed opinions on this place, my personal experience has been very good. It's not the best sushi I've ever had, but it's a solid choice for dinner takeout."}
{"text":"Decent sushi... lunch special is around 8 bucks which is great for the location however you'd have to order two bento to fill you up... no joke. I'm a small again I don't eat much and even then their portion don't satisfy me !"}
{"text":"I love sushi sky because it's cheap, fast, and sushi. The lunch specials are reasonably yummy and definitely filling. I usually eat my miso soup, salad and either the salmon twists or maki and take the other one for later."}
{"text":"I almost wanted to leave just after reading through the all-you-can-eat menu, because the selection of sashimi and rolls is so limited and boring. The quality of the food is definitely below average. The salmon and white tuna sashimi were not fresh. The texture was mushy, a bit sticky, and about to fall apart. There was even a fish bone in the salmon sashimi. Most of the rolls we ordered were filled at least half by tempura bits, which I thought is lame and cheap. There were only two okay dishes: salmon skin roll and Thai curry chicken skewer. Price-wise, at $22 per person for dinner it is not cheap at all given the poor selection and quality."}
{"text":"Lunch bento is really bad
They also removed surf clam from all you can eat dinner
Won't be coming back now"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The food is always fresh and great. Now they have the all you can eat sushi menu. A good value for sure! This is a great friendly neighborhood restaurant. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I think the default Yelp description of 3 starts is very apt in this case: \"A-OK\". My girlfriend and I have been eating at Sushi Sky ever since we moved to Toronto over 5 years ago. She's been eating there since she started going to Ryerson 10 years ago.

Sushi Sky delivers consistently solid sushi and a very good price. We usually get 3 or 4 maki rolls along with the expected salad & miso soup. They don't have anything really fancy or different and the quality isn't as good as some of the more expensive Japanese restaurants in the city, but it's a great option of you're looking for a good quality to price ratio.

I also find the staff (who are all exactly the same from at least 5 years ago) very attentive. Usually there's tea waiting for you before your butt hits the chair and they never let it go below half. The food and bill are always brought promptly, but there's no rush to get you to leave if you're not in a hurry.

Some recommended maki rolls:
- spicy salmon (their spicy mayo is excellent)
- black dragon (if you like unagi)
- sushi sky (if you like variety)"}
{"text":"The food is good and pretty large portion! The price is very reasonable and the silver combo box is a super good deal!!"}
{"text":"Sushi rolls are big. I mean there's a lot of rice. 
Service is slow. A lot of waitress just walks up and down and not checking tables for their orders or refilling drinks. 
Food doesn't taste good. I'm still waiting for my order as i'm writing this review. I ordered sushi rolls 15 mins ago and I'm still waiting for it."}
{"text":"This is a definitely a favorite for the work lunch crowd. The lunch specials are cheap and the staff is attentive. However, boy do they pile on the rice in the sushi. I literally have to take chunks of rice out because it just not possible to consume that much rice.  

The lunch bento box options are pretty decent as well. I always order the sweet and sour chicken which has just the right amount of fried saucy goodness."}
{"text":"The main reason that this particular sushi restaurant is so good, is the value.

Upon entering this fantastic restaurant you are immediately acknowledged by the staff and promptly seated. The menu has everything you would expect from a typical Sushi restaurant, but its really the food quality, attentive service and reasonable prices that keeps me coming back. I was introduced to Sushi Sky a few years ago and it has been my 1st choice for sushi in Toronto ever since.

Its located right at Yonge and College, so if you are downtown and hungry for some fabulous sushi, you really have no excuse not to check out Sushi Sky."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best sushi in town, but great lunch spot. Quick and inexpensive (especially if you order of the lunch menu). It was my 2 nd time there, but will make it a regular occurrence."}
{"text":"I know that people love this place but I've never been overly impressed. The sushi is just okay. Service is just okay usually. 

However the last time I went for lunch during the week, we ended up waiting almost an hour for the meal. That's ridiculous. It's lunchtime downtown, people have to go back to work within a reasonable amount of time. 

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Toronto is a big town and undoubtedly has better sushi places than Sushi Sky, but I like this little sushi restaurant nestled amongst all the shops and hustle on Yonge Street.
I also like them for their cheap and tasty sushi selections. I've filled up here many times with friends, including a large group once, and everything has always been fresh and accompanied by good service."}
{"text":"OK, I will start this review by mentioning that I have never eaten in at Sushi Sky, so I can't say much about their service in that regard, but as someone who has ordered delivery from them a lot (like, a lot a lot), there are many reasons why Sushi Sky is the only sushi place I will order in from.

The first and foremost reason I always keep coming back to Sushi Sky is because their sashimi (salmon specifically, which I order every time) is always thick, fresh, tender, melt in your mouth good. It's never that kind of chewy, not so fresh tasting stuff I seemed to get most of the time when I used to order from other sushi places.

Beyond that, their seaweed salad is fantastic and very well portioned, their gyoza is perfectly crisp every time (and dirt cheap at $2.50 for an order of 5), and they have green tea ice cream, yum!

Delivery times are great as well, usually within 25 to my area. They quote 45 minutes, but have only ever once taken that long during that bit of a storm we had yesterday. My miso soup is always hot, ice cream always cold, and the delivery driver is a doll, though he doesn't speak much English.

All in all, with the way too many sushi options that deliver downtown, Sushi Sky is your best bet for good quality, cheap eats sushi."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place across from the hotel I am staying. The reviews had been mixed, but I have to give it a 5 star rating. The sushi is excellent and fresh. Service is friendly and attentive. The selection in the AYCE is good and I do like this place better than spring sushi which I had visited the day before. $21.99 for the AYCE is a good price.  Will come here next week again. I truly enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"i always order delivery from here on justeat because they deliver sooo fast. like 15 minutes after i order, they're at the door...which might be because they're relatively close to me but still, i'm impressed. the sashimi is always really fresh and so is the sushi. overall, a really good place"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times. Decor is modern and the restaurant is clean. Never had a problem with the service. Tea and water are constantly refilled and the food comes quickly. 

As far as the food goes the deep fry oil could use more frequent changing other than that its typical food quality for any cookie cutter Chinese owned AYCE sushi joint. Good selection of menu items although they just stopped offering BBQ eel (unagi) due to global price increases. 

Cheap at $13 bucks for AYCE  lunch however if you are looking for authentic Japanese sushi this is definitely not the place."}
{"text":"The yelpers are once again correct. This is a restaurant where price point during lunch wins out over the need for quality. Additional 10% off for takeout is the cherry on top. 

Fish was decent quality nothing off about the fish, but not the best I've ever had. Will return if I need a cheap lunch. Takeout service took about 10 mins for 4 pieces of assorted sushi and 3+3 salmon/cucumber maki."}
{"text":"My favourite place in Toronto for sushi, I know I haven't try them all but so far this was the best! Nice place and reasonable price! You should definitely try the sushi pizza, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"I like \"treating\" myself to lunch here. Treating in quotes, because it's actually not that expensive at all considering their great lunch options and it would be more expensive for me to get a sandwich and a dessert at a convenience place. I always get the same lunch, lunch A, just the right amount of food, and yummy. Lunch during the week was can busy because all of the office people coming here on their lunch break but only once did I have to wait more than 2 minutes to be seated. Service is quick and the waiters, while not overly friendly, are around when you need them. It's not the best Japanese restaurant in town but it's convenient, cheap, and good enough for me to keep going back."}
{"text":"Lunchtime Crowd Pleaser

I eat at Sushi Sky at least once a month, usually with colleagues, occasionally with friends who work nearby.  This particular visit was stop number four in a 72-hour birthday bender, an old Hamilton friend turned fellow Torontonian, P.S., was buying me lunch.

I've always been a fan of Sushi Sky for their speed and value.  For $15, I can get absolutely rammed full of Japanese food, usually rolls and sashimi.  I usually go for the 8-piece Sashimi Appetizer ($8) and Super Set A ($7), which comprises salad, soup and 12 rolls.  The food is always good but never earth-shattering.  It's just decent sushi for a decent price.  Realistically, you only need the Super Set, and they have $5 sets too.

A lot of sushi servers I encounter have a way of \"dumping\" food at the table with little to no concern for whose it is or how it's presented.  Some places are worse than others, but these days Sushi Sky seems to have deteriorated in this department.  It's gotten to the point where I'm starting to feel rushed or that I'm getting in my server's way by enjoying my lunch.  They now leave plates hanging half-off the table from time to time or play bumper plates in order to shuffle them around.  Maybe it's like this everywhere, but I don't like it one bit.

Notwithstanding my objections, everyone else I dine with seems to like Sushi Sky and doesn't usually worry too much about these things, which is why I'd note that they're OK for groups.  The only time I saw anyone else bothered about the service was when a server pointed out that a colleague had dropped her napkin on the floor, and proceeded to stare at her until she picked it up and handed it to him.  She actually had to ask for a new one!

Good for groups, good for a fast lunch.  If you work nearby, you can probably eat and get back to the office in 45 minutes or less."}
{"text":"Service at this place is incredibly hit or miss - usually more MISS than hit no doubt.  Being ignored is heavily easy to do!  Equally easy is receiving the wrong order.

The food itself is pretty decent for a budget shop!  No complaints on the food other than it often takes a little bit of time, isn't always right (ie. they don't bring what you ordered they bring something else all together) and they lack a bit of the variety a few other places have.

If you are looking for a fine dinning experience - this is NOT your place.  If you are craving sushi, have 10 bucks in your pocket and a little bit of time, stop in!  We frequently quite regularly - despite the bad service the quality is consistent.

Last time we dinned in we did NOT leave a tip due to the insanity that was the service (no service, had to walk from back of restaurant to front of restaurant 3 times to fetch a server - didn't bring what we ordered even though we ordered by the item name not menu number, hard to mix that one up, took an exceeding amount of time to make/deliver food, the days wait staff were quite kirt) upon paying the woman taking our money had the audacity to say \"oh...mam you didn't include a tip, give me your card back and we'll do it again\"  A tip is not a legal right, it's an earned reward!

Regardless...we'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Great selection, and it's one of the best AYCE places I've ever been. The sushi roll orders come in 4 or 6, which is perfect when you want to try a couple different types of rolls. Everything came very quickly, the servers were on top of reordering and drink refills, which you rarely see! And it's right downtown at Yonge and College. I wish they had sashimi included in AYCE but everything else was spot on!"}
{"text":"Okay I will run you through the experience I had at sushi sky. 

When I walked in my first impression was very positive I was greeted by a very polite and friendly staff member. I ordered some Sake to drink and some gyoza as an appetizer the sake was nice and hot with good flavor. However the gyoza was soft and lukewarm as if it was zapped in a microwave. I ate 2 and placed it aside. I then asked the server if I should order the ramen or the hot pot and which he recommended, he quickly said the hot pot takes a while and that I should order the ramen.. strange I asked which was better not the cook time. So I went with ramen and assorted tempura. The tempura was really good! But the ramen was terrible, it had no flavor the noodles were very soft like they had been boiling for 3 times the standard cook time and the vegetables did not seem fresh at all. I then decided to order some sushi, and went with my all time favorite \"Saba\" it came out quick but looked really dry and was falling apart. When I tried it I got a really dry and chewy texture, seems like it has been sitting out of a long time or was getting old. Anyways there were some decent things and the place looks nice. I hope they take more care in the food the make since this is near my house and I would like to try again."}
{"text":"What a great sushi restaurant! It met all my needs. It was fast, fresh, and well priced. They offer lunch and dinner deals and an all you can eat option. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This was the closest sushi spot to the Courtyard Marriott on Yonge Street. It was in the low 20's so I just took the trek across the street and did AYCE for the low price of $21.99. 

I ordered the typical:

Miso Soup
Yam Tempura
Vegetable Tempura
Shrimp Tempura
YAS I love my fried tempura LOL
Salmon
White Tuna aka Super White
Yellowtail
Tuna
Ikura

Everything was ok. I'd say i had sashimi at other spots that taste way better. The service was mediocre. I had to keep flagging them down and I felt like I was being that annoying customer. They walked by my empty plate and water a few times before I would flag them.

The one thing they didnt have was radish wasabi aka fresh wasabi. I love it especially when I am eating sashimi. 

Overall, it was OK. I would suggest going somewhere else if you can"}
{"text":"Nothing that jumps out at you while looking at the menu of this restaurant. Typical Japanese restaurant.  Prices are reasonable. Food portions not bad.  Quick service, food came out hot, servers were some what attentive. Located at Yonge and Wellesley. We had the edaname, age tofu, goyza and I had a vegetarian bento box, my friend had the vegetarian sushi rolls."}
{"text":"So once again my craving for average priced good sushi got me feeling guilty.

I've walked across Sushi Sky often and seen a lot of Asian people eating there, so I just assumed its pretty decent (sorry for the generalization). I guess none of them are eating the sushi (maybe teriyaki or something).

I ordered myself a red dragon roll (8pieces) and a dynamite roll (4/5pieces). I was a little surprised by the price of the rolls, the red dragon was 10.99 and dynamite was 5.60. The red dragon roll was nothing special, I always try my rolls without any soy sauce first because it is known that if its good sushi, you won't find the need for it. Well this was not. It was dry and I had to dip it into soy, unfortunately I couldn't dip it too much because their soy was too salty (at least it seemed that way when mixed with the vinegar-y rice). The dynamite roll was even less appetizing, not only was it dry, it was like trying to shove a mammoth down my mouth. 

I once again have spent $20 on below average sushi. And so, the hunt continues."}
{"text":"I cannot figure out how the word 'sky' fits into the theme of this restaurant. Not a clue. 

My friend and I were in the mood for wings. We first thought about going to All Stars in 16th Avenue, but by the time we were approaching the on ramp, we found ourselves southbound because I've read an article listing the best chicken wing joints in the city. Yes it was Toronto Life. We exited on the Gardiner onto Yonge, headed Westward on College into hipsterville, and parked our car in Yorkville. Then we walked down on Yonge and ended up in Sushi Sky. 
Things are not going well this week for me.

The sign over the door was in-your-face and looked more appropriate for a Greek restaurant rather than a sushi place. The décor was...straight. It appears that this place has been here for awhile. The washroom gave the illusion of being dirty, but upon inspection it was just a bit aged. The cleanliness was above my expectation. But the lighting in the basement where it was located seems to better fit a butcher house where dead hookers are kept. Definitely go to powder up with a friend ladies.

The spicy salmon was not chewy enough, and of course the sushi chefs here were no masters. But the price was befitting to this venue, and the service was civilized. One of the waitresses insisted to her co-worker that she must find a foreigner to date. She spoken in Mandarin, so my friend looked at me awkwardly when I started laughing to myself.
I never had to ask for my water to be topped, and there wasn't too much fault I can find in Sushi Sky. 

Throughout the evening I saw faces peeking inside, pounding whether to nourish their hunger here. I nodded at them from my table...none of them came in after seeing me perform this action."}
{"text":"I used to love this place until my husband and I decided to order delivery from them one night...

When our food came to the door there was no soy sauce, no wasabi, no napkins, no chopsticks and barely enough ginger. Upon opening our salad containers, we discovered that there wasn't even a drop of dressing in either one of ours! The miso soups were cold (we live two blocks away) and the quality of our sashimi and sushi combos were terrible.

I must say, I have never had this happen when we went to dine in. The food quality is usually okay. Not the best sushi ever, but good. However, what happened next is why I will NEVER give them my business again.

Because of the lack luster delivery, I felt a bit insulted so I called Sushi Sky and asked to speak with the manager or owner. All I wanted was for them to resend the order or give me some sort of discount on our next one. Not only was this man SO RUDE, he wasn't about to correct the problem and acted as if he didn't care about what happened. He raised his voice at me! Unbelievable...

This place has THE WORST customer service ever and apparently they don't know how to package their deliveries properly."}
{"text":"Service must be hit or miss.  The second time we visited this place, all the servers seemed to have attitude.  We visited during lunch hour on a weekend - the restaurant was maybe 10% full and there were servers just walking around trying to look busy.  But, when we asked for spoons for the miso soup, the waitress gave us the impression we were bothering her and she said to us \"miso is not supposed to be eaten with a spoon\" - okay, so maybe she is right, but does she need to give us attitude for asking for a spoon?

Our main waiter was also not very welcoming.  I almost felt like he was annoyed with us and never once smiled.

I'm not sure why the wait staff was so cold and maybe even slightly  hostile towards me and my family ... the place never seems busy when I walk by - shouldn't they try to attract customers?  

Lunch specials are cheaper than dinner specials (I think) but the portions are a lot less too. 

Our dinner bento boxes were a much better deal.

Sushi was still fantastic and flavourful but we left the place not feeling very welcomed."}
{"text":"The wait time is so long. Specially the guy server or the owner is pretty rude. The food is good but they don't proceeds the order what we have ordered . I have order sushi pizza and many dishes which they didn't took the order at all... really disappointed and will never be back for sure"}
{"text":"Horrible food to me! The sashimi is frozen and not fresh. The Sushi is lose and tied by seaweed. The roll is complete a mess. Even the seaweed salad which u almost cannot screw up, tastes so artificial. If u want to kill ur desire for Japanese food, this restaurant is perfect choose."}
{"text":"This is my little go to place whenever I am in Toronto. The sushi and service are good. The beer is always cold. The prices are always decent!"}
{"text":"20$ for all you can eat sushi- for lunch. The seaweed wrap inside the sushi is a little chewy. The sushis arent amazing. The menu isnt too expansive, and they did not offer shrimp sushi which is my favourite and also a basic item that they should have offered."}
{"text":"Really liked the place, great sushi and japanese dishes at a reasonable price! The tempura dishes are amazing, better than average, super crunchy and non-oily at all. Yummy.

I like the fact that they have all you can eat buffet at a good price (also on weekends +1 dollar), but if you do not want the buffet option you can choose between 4 or 5 menus at a very good price too, which include various options with soup, salads, sushi, rice or any thing you may want to eat."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Someone said it well here - decent budget sushi. No rush to go back though..."}
{"text":"Got take-out.  Took a while to wait, but the gentleman offered us tea or water, which was kind.  10% off for takeout which isn't really a huge incentive.  I got the ikura nigiri and the larger sashimi platter and it was good, surprisingly good.  Wasabi had the proper \"kick\".  Good for the neighbourhood, I'd be back for take out again but dining in doesn't seem that appealing to me."}
{"text":"Had the sashimi boat with rice. According to the pictures I was expecting a lot more, it was okay. I would not order it again because the portions are really small.

Ambiance is standard for a Japanese restaurant but every seems to be Chinese here, how authentic is that? Good thing is that there's a lot of seating."}
{"text":"My order:
Avocado Salad   $3.50
Veggie Tempura   $2.99
Salmon Sashimi Roll   $6.99

Let's start with the avocado salad:  Fresh, crisp greens with enormous chunks of perfectly ripened avocado covered in a tasty ginger dressing.  This was definitely a big winner with me and if it came in a larger size, I could probably order this as an entree and be completely satisfied.

The veggie tempura was super cheap and completely over-portioned.  Sweet potato and zucchini deliciously deep-friend and ready to take up residence in my belly!

The salmon sashimi roll was very fresh with thick cut salmon wrapped around avocado, cucumber and mayo.  If you're not a big fan of rice, you'll be a big fan of this roll!

I ordered take-out so I cannot comment on much other than the food.  If I lived in Toronto, this would definitely be my new sushi spot.  It's conveniently located on Yonge St. a stones throw from the College subway station.  If you're in the area, don't pass it by!"}
{"text":"Food: 7/10 -- Value: 8/10 -- Service: 7/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 7/10

Surprisingly, the sushi I had for all-you-can-eat lunch was better than the a la carte sushi I ordered last time. At around $15 for lunch AYCE, I was pretty satisfied with what we got. The sushi rolls were surrounded by an acceptable layer of rice and there was no secret stash of rice underneath the fish this time to try to fill you up. Among the rolls, the crispy anything were my favourite. Crispy spicy salmon, butter fish.

The standout fish was definitely the satay (I think?) chicken skewers that were covered in a flavourful peanut sauce. 

Service was okay. It's a busy place and it seemed like there were only two or three people waiting on the lunch rush, so it was tough for them. There were a few dishes that were missed, but we didn't want them anyway by the time we realized.

This place is good for what it is: reasonably priced downtown cheap sushi."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! A lunch special is amazing! White tuna maki, salmon avocado maki and salmon rose. Only $7!"}
{"text":"Good service, the food is alright. Friendly priced, dinner for two was $67. But they should really be taking Amex, especially given the downtown location."}
{"text":"Have had really delicious sushi, sashimi and seaweed salad. Very convenient location with attentive servers."}
{"text":"Excellent food, extremely reasonable prices! The atmosphere is cozy and calm. Perfect date spot! We will definitely be returning. My only two complaints are the lack of parking and the very unenthusiastic wait staff. Other than that, I absolutely loved it and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The service generally would not have been so absolutely terrible if I didn't speak Chinese. I remember going there last April with my then-boyfriend who is Latino so we were speaking English. This store is/was (not sure if they changed owners since then) entirely staffed by Mandarin-speaking individuals. I accidentally knocked over my glass half full of water, and heard our waiter call me \"dumb\". I got really angry and started explaining his rudeness in Chinese, which elicited a \"tsk\" sound from him and he walked away. Needless to say I did not tip and did not go back again. 

The food was poor/mediocre at best, typically expected of a day-old fast food container, but not one where you have a waiter. Complete waste of time and money. 

As for the decor, the front half looks okay, but we got seated in the back, and I rate based on where we were seated - which was ill-lit, noisy, and right in front of the stairs leading to the washroom."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but my latest visit for Lunch was pretty lackluster. 

The Good
-service was good
-prices are low

The Bad
-their lunch menu combos are far from impressive -- there's no sushi + roll combo that I liked
-miso soup was close to taste-less
-the teriyaki chicken in my bento box consisted of 5 tiny strips of chicken
-the salad was shit -- i got mostly the ends and the dressing tasted like water
-their rolls are too big -- i had trouble fitting one into my mouth
-their maki rolls were largely rice, not enough fish

I probably wouldn't go back here.  Compared to some of the places in the Annex (ie. Big Sushi), this place is weak!"}
{"text":"I always order Dragon B, eel roll. It is AMAZING. 
The rest dishes are okay.
Parking might be a problem."}
{"text":"Below average sushi. The rolls were small and had very little filling. Sashimi wasn't very fresh.
They charged 1.50 for soup/salad even though we didn't ask for it, they just put it on our table. Tasteless miso soup, and gross brown lettuce leaves doused in a mayo dressing.

First time coming here for lunch, will never come back. Save your money and go somewhere else, there's many more sushi options in the area!"}
{"text":"I find Sushi sky, reliable, reasonable, and a good place to take people. Its not the best sushi in Toronto, but its the one I go to the most often. 

The service has been decent, never had a bad experience. Sometimes its quite difficult to get anyones attention, and the staff will go long periods without ever checking on tables but sometimes the staff are super attentive at refilling water/tea.
Sushi is good, tempura alright. Salads are always the same desultory lettuce with ginger dressing that every japanese restaurant in Toronto seems to offer.  I prefer it to the many of the others in the area. 

They have increased their prices, so its no longer quite as competitive as it once was. (2014)"}
{"text":"Lunch was so quick we had a chance to head out and shop a bit before returning to work.  Nothing beats having the lunch hour respected.  Paying was quick and the food was top notch.  Love it Sushi Sky!"}
{"text":"With so many sushi restaurants in the downtown area, it's a competitive business. Sushi Sky is yet another Chinese owned sushi place with fairly standard prices and food. They don't have AYCE but their a la carte menu is solid. 

Their dinner/lunch specials are fairly priced (just like most other sushi places downtown). Their quality is ok (just like most other sushi places downtown). As usual in Asian places, they don't focus much on service, which I completely don't mind. 

With nothing memorable to write about, this restaurant deserves the standard 3 stars. If you're in the area and isn't looking for anything fancy, Sushi Sky is a decent choice."}
{"text":"This place was a cute spot on Yonge. Great décor and clean washrooms. Had the Vegetarian Combo Box for lunch. I managed to ask the waiter to switch my 3 Gyozas (3 deep friend dumplings that came as part of the combo box) for shrimp tempuras (that didn't come as part of this combo box). The waiter came back and offered me 2 shrimp tempuras instead of 3 in lieu of the dumplings. I also was told I would have to pay $1.50 extra.  In my opinion, this wasn't fair. I understand paying 1.50 extra for 3 tempuras but to reduce it to 2 tempuras. 

The food was okay - not as great as other sushi places. I felt the tofu covered in teriyaki tasted like jelly. My lunch mate felt the same way. Too jelly-like."}
{"text":"Did not have AYCE; We weren't feeling that hungry, so we got dinner specials instead.

My partner got the Silver Box combo which includes grilled chicken, assorted veg. tempura, and a salmon & avocado roll. I got Dinner Special #2, which comes with chicken/steak/salmon tereyaki, tempura, and 3 pieces of california roll. I got the steak, and asked to change the california roll out with a spicy mayo salmon & avocado roll. I was told that there would be a charge for this substitution (which I was already expecting). What I was not expecting was that I would get 6 pieces and be charged $2, instead of the usual $1 for substitutions found every where else.

Both our specials came with miso and salad as appetizers and rice and fruit (half an orange) as part of the bento box. My dinner special had 2 pieces of shrimp tempura and 3 or 4 pieces of veg. tempura. I was not expecting this either. Esp since we had told our server that my partner has an allergy to shrimp/shellfish.

I was okay to eat it, but we had to be very careful about sharing food (I wasn't able to just give him the stuff I didn't want to eat, or steal off his plate, I couldn't steal his drink, etc).

I'll likely come back someday because it seems like a place my friends go to (being in their neighbourhood). Unfortunately, I've found that most sushi houses in the downtown core are not quite to my liking. If it's not the price, then it's the service, or the quality of food, or something. With this one, it's pretty serious that I was served shrimp without it being mentioned at all beforehand (and it's not specified on the menu) despite my dining companion mentioning an allergy to them."}
{"text":"The quality of the rolls weren't good at all. They didn't have green dragon. Only two ice cream flavours. They add extra powder in dynamite rolls which makes you to feel full sooner. Edamame were over cooked."}
{"text":"Good prices plus an all you can eat sushi menu ($22.99 during the week and $2 more on weekends and holidays) . They have a good solid menu though nothing very unique. Sushi is fresh and well made. Friendly servers. They take credit cards except AMEX."}
{"text":"Great place to get all you can eat sushi for a a great price! Wide selection of the usual items, great udon soups, large pieces of both sashimi and rolls, and quick service. Pen and paper ordering system."}
{"text":"The decor is good and the location is good. That being said, the sushi and rolls are average but they do seem to have their fair share of regulars that eat there, usually for the specials. The fish seems to be decent quality but honestly, it's hard to tell. Sometimes the fish is warm, sometimes it's cold but I suspect that's just depending on whether they've iced them recently.

I've only ever ate here for the all you can eat which is typical for sushi restaurants around here. I recommend the dinner AYCE over the lunch AYCE as that actually comes with sashimi and they are quite generous with that. The selection for the lunch is also smaller. 

There are also quite a few fried items on the menu. A lot of the items are coated with curry or have butter in them. I find that they tend to serve those first, possibly because they're quicker to make and gets you filled faster. 

The service is normal. The servers are quick to remove dishes and refill water. They're quick to bring desert if you ask them directly for it. They did mess up my bill one time, but it wasn't a big deal and I think it was the machine's fault. 

Overall, I still come here relatively often because I like the convenience and the food."}
{"text":"The place is large & to my surprise at noon on a Saturday there was just one other person in the restaurant (hope I didn't make a mistake of stopping in today) when I got here, but during the course of our lunch the place started to fill up. Sushi Sky has been here for years and the place is always busy at night.  

Right away our server brought nice hot green tea - and today it cold outside, so it was truly needed. 

We ordered sashimi (white tuna & salmon), and of course I had to have Ikura (yum), a salmon roll with no rice - I asked for it to be spicy and it was just mayo. 

The Miso soup is very nice. My friend ordered dragon roll and some sushi and he said it was \"ok\" - I didn't like the white radish on the plate, it had an odd taste. 

The food came very quickly and was very good quality. The salmon sashimi pieces were very large. The butter fish (white tuna) was increasingly soft and melted in my mouth. 

All in all, not a bad place to grab quick sushi lunch.
Customer Service was great, food was typical sushi, atmosphere was ok and price was good !"}
{"text":"I came here with my mom on Saturday for AYCE dinner. The rice was a bit too sour, and the salmon sashimi slices were super thick. They put a lot of rice into every sushi so you get full really quickly. Fried calamari and Thai chicken skewers were tasty, but everything else was below average. 
The service was terrible. I asked for more tea and ordered green salad THREE TIMES but they never came till the very end when I got super mad. 
Will never go back again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. The food is still good but the service sucks. Every time I come they forget something. Last time we had all you can eat, and they forgot half our order... No big deal... We filled out another form... The next round, forgot 2 things.... Then nobody came to our table for over 30mins... UNTIL I asked for the bill... Then they jumped.

Now, I'm currently sitting in the restaurant; ordered the exact same thing I always get, and NO miso soup or salad... Everyone is getting their meal before me.

I need to find a new place! I'm done with this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm over it. I went for dinner today and they brought tempura sauce with a bug swimming in it. When I pointed it out they didn't apologize or anything. They just removed the bowl from the table and brought a new one. Then all the rolls are covered in black sesame seeds so I spent the rest of the meal inspecting every bite to ensure I wasn't chewing on more bugs. To complete the experience, I ordered a yam tempura roll with mayo. Received a yam tempura roll without mayo. Boo. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place is fast, yummy and cheap. The downside is that the service is really rushed. Despite that I've returned here quite a few times because I appreciate how cheap and fast it is. You can get in and out within 30 minutes, and have a huge plate of sushi with soup, salad and green tea for under $20 (including tip)."}
{"text":"Good service, great portions, delicious sushi (veggie), and super affordable! The only reason is doesn't get five stars is that staff don't regularly check back in with you to ensure that you don't need anything else/want to order more/etc."}
{"text":"Great place for a lunch time deal!

I am a big fan of salmon rose (called salmon cakes here....not sure why).  To my happy surprise, found out that they provide two with the lunch special!

Came here twice now, first for the a la carte option second for the lunch ayce.  

A la carte was good.  Decently priced, came with a good amount of food, and had me filled.  

AYCE  option was not as great.  Not only were their food options rather limited,they not have salmon roses on there (boo!). The food still tasted great, came out within a decent time and left me happy.

Definitely would come back again, since it's really close to work."}
{"text":"This place is fairly good in an overall sense. Service is friendly and nonimposing, food comes decently fast,  and the place is always moderately busy. It's not really a place for high quality sushi or sashimi but their food is not at all too bad. Their ayce is great value too.
Would recommend this place as a casual dropin with one or two friends or reasonably priced takeout in Japanese food"}
{"text":"Inedible. I never knew sushi can be this bad ... please, I do not wish even for my worst enemy to come visit this restaurant. 

This restaurant should be ranked #1 having the worst sushi all you can eat in Toronto. Let's see where to start ...

- Quality of seafood. Time after time, the fish placed on sushi is not only miniscule but has a pretty dismal quality. All the fish / shrimp / soft shell cab taste very rubbery, bland. Even their Tobiko (Fish roe) is very hard and dry.  

- Amount of rice. I get it, AYCE have to cut corners, but the amount of rice placed in Sushi Sky is just mind blowing.  In our party, we started to get full even after eating five pieces of sushi. The amount of rice is just unreal. One portion of roll can feed entire family in Africa. 

- Service. Since we didn't even touch most of our foods - and we didn't even order any second round, the server warned us that we would be charged extra if we did not finish the food. I have to explain to her that the food is literally inedible. 

Overall, Sushi Sky is a disgrace to sushi food culture. There is absolute and utter neglect of food quality to its patrons. Again, Simply inedible."}
{"text":"Good place for an all you can eat sushis night!! 
The service is average, most of the servers don't speak English (or don't speak at all). If you're q big table, they sometimes forget what you ordered so keep a picture of your order in your phone! 

Sushis and rolls are good and with the price  for all-you-can-eat only!"}
{"text":"It was around $21 per person for AYCE plus tax and tip. Very reasonable considering it is dinner all you can eat that you're paying for. I must say, the quality of service and food is far better than the AYCE joints I'm accustomed to uptown, in Markham or Richmond Hill, for similar prices.

The staff were very helpful and attentive, always refilling our tea, even after we had paid the bill and gotten our desserts. Food-wise, lots of variety and I think everything we ordered actually came - which is very, very surprising for an AYCE sushi place. Some of the food was a bit out of our expectations though. The mango and avocado roll was an avocado roll with mango sauce drizzled on top white the calamari, looked more like onion rings. They have quite a lot of seats, so I wouldn't worry too much about going in early or making a reservation too much.

Otherwise, glad to have found a nice and affordable AYCE place of quality in the downtown core!"}
{"text":"This place has an all you can eat option as well as La carte. We decided to go for the la carte option(order individual rolls).

I ordered the golden chicken teriyaki box, which came out very well. It was good quality. The shrimp tempura was nicely done and the 6 salmon rolls were delicious. It was 12 dollars I believe for the box during dinner hours(maybe it is less at lunch?)

we also ordered 2 rolls(forgot which ones) but they were very good. Quality was nice.

Service was great as well, quick and did not have to wait too long.

Overall I am giving this place 4 stars because the service was great, food quality was great and price was more then fair for downtown toronto near where all the tourists come."}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit. Located conveniently around the Yonge/College area, it's your typical Chinese-run cheap sushi joint. I've been about half a dozen times and I've always left satisfied. Nothing too exotic, but I've never had bad fish here.  

Pros
1 - Price: pretty nice prices, comparable to other similar establishments
2 - Seating: I've never had to wait for a seat here..it's always about half full in the evenings, even on Friday or Saturday nights. However, it's also not completely empty, which always makes me wary (few customers = fish sitting on the counter longer) 
3 - Service: waiters certainly don't grovel at your feet, but they are quick, food is quick, and the tea continuously flows.

Cons
1 - Rice: it's a funny thing to judge sushi restaurants by, but I find that the way they season the rice is about average...I've been to places with excellent sushi rice, and this is not one of them.
2 - Bathrooms: a little gross."}
{"text":"2.5 STARS

I came here for a quick bite to eat prior meeting up with my friends.  It's a big restaurant that also does takeout.  If you get seated at the front you can see the dishes being made.  

I ordered the hot sake and the Crystal Maki roll (4 rolls, wrapped in rice paper, with avocados, spicy).  It was definitely spicy which I'm glad b/c most sushi places that say spicy aren't really spicy to me.  I just wanted a quick bite to tide me over for a bit as we were going out to dinner later.

I;m not sure if someone called in sick or what but there were only 2 servers and the place was busy - therefore the service was slow.  It was pleasant, don't get me wrong...but sloooooow.

The maki I had was ok - except for the spice I couldn't really taste much of anything else.  Plus the rice papers stuck to each other and it was difficult to eat.....everything kept falling out.  

They do also have AYCE options.  It would be good for a big group since the back of the restaurant can certainly accommodate a large group.  I'm sure there are better places to get sushi in the area."}
{"text":"I've never been to sushi sky despite how often I walk by this place. So today I decided to check this place out with my bf coz I haven't had sushi in a long time. $13.99 for ayce lunch sushi, sold. But everything went wrong and I don't even know where to start.

The sushi? I've never had any warm sushi before. The salmon, the tuna and everything was meant to be cold was warm. Weird! And the sushi rolls? The usual dirty tactic, packed with lots of rice. And that shrimp tempura rolls almost suffocate me because it was filled with bits of tempura crumbs. Not happy!

When the fried scallop and squid arrived oh boy the coating/batter was dark brown instead of golden brown. Yuck! 

We ordered edamame and it was gross! How can anyone f'ed up edamame?? The moment I saw those poor edamame I knew I wouldn't coming back ever again. 

Finally, their snake move happened again.  My bf ordered 1 piece of vege spring roll and guess how many came? FIVE! 

I also suspect a lot of the ingredients were not fresh, I went home and puked a few times. I don't know what's \"yummy\" about this place. Everything was below average."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, attentive service and tasty sushi. Can't beat an all you can eat at a great price and service."}
{"text":"What happened to this lovely Sushi place? It used to be packed, food was great and staff were awesome. 
Now, met at the door by staff who asked me to repeat my order a couple of times when I asked for take-out, seemed like she really didn't care or have a clue at what I was saying/ordering and the vibe inside, while I was waiting for my order, seemed dismal. 
This used to be my fave place to come for quick, tasty sushi. 
No longer, sadly."}
{"text":"So, I'm not normally a fan of all-you-can-eat Japanese restaurants. The quality of the food usually is so poor, you'll regret it afterwards. However, the all-you-can-eat option at Sushi sky is pretty amazing. 

You get to choose from a pretty big menu, ranging from sushi rolls to sashimi to udon noodles to teriyaki to tempura to much more. And, the food quality is really quite good. 

Best of all, the all-you-can-eat lunch on weekdays is just  $15 CAD! It's practically free! So bring an empty stomach, and get ready to gorge!"}
{"text":"I tried AYCE Lunch. Waiter was attentive who refill tea and water very often. Food was good which match as the price."}
{"text":"I had a craving for sushi and this place was close to my hotel. It was just okay. The staff was friendly and attentive but I wasn't wowed by the food."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite before heading to a show....only had 30min to order and eat. I had the veg tempura entree with salad and miso soup as it was the first veg meal I saw and I was panicky about time.....bad choice! Salad and soup were fine. The tempura was deep fried (obviously) and so greasy....also not gluten free so I suffered for my poor choice. Serves me right! I got a bowl of steamed rice with my tempura.....ummm, why? What do I eat it with? I left it behind.
Hubby was going to get steak entree but they said chicken would be faster so he had the chicken teriyaki and enjoyed it.
Cheap, fast and friendly service....I should have chosen a more appropriate option suitable to my hf and vegan needs."}
{"text":"This Place Was The Worst All You Can Eat Sushi Restaurant! When we went there, The server said \" We close soon, so it's the last time that you can order\" , so, at that time we ordered 40 pieces of sushi, then they asked us \" Are you guys really able to eat all ? If you guys left sushi, you need to pay more 20$ \" What The F**k. Whatever! we didn't change our decision. However, when we got the sushi, they served Different Size of Sushi!! Which was Huge Rice!! With Really Tiny Sashimi Seriously!! The Size of Sashimi looked like nail size What The Hell? I still have the photo which is the Fkin Huge Rice Sushi!! It's So Mean!! Whatever we ate the fkin 40 pieces of Huge sushi because we didn't want to pay more!! each person 20$? Whaaaaat? Anyway, I will never go this place again if my boss asks me to go there"}
{"text":"Sushi Sky deserves a 3.5 star considering how you are getting more value than what you pay for. The All You Can Eat (AYCE) is $15 before tax on weekdays which is cheaper than most places and the quality of food and service is as good as or better, than some AYCEs that charge more.

I came here on a Thursday with some coworkers with low expectations of the place due to low reviews. To my surprise, the customer service was really good. After placing our order, it only took a few minutes for all the food to come in. They also did not charge us for some of the pieces we couldn't finish which is always good (for the customers at least).

The sushi here was decent but I do wish their menu had more variety. You order on a piece of paper and there are no fancy Ipads with pictures of the different rolls. In addition, if you order their ramen, you will be surprised since it comes in a pretty big bowl in comparison to other AYCEs.

Overall, Sushi Sky is a pretty good restaurant if you are craving sushi at an affordable price. I will definitely come back when I want to be reunited with Itis."}
{"text":"This place is my standard sushi place when I don't really know what to have for dinner on a Friday and want to stay in and get my food delivered. I have ordered most of the stuff off their menu but I have stuck with either the Katsu Don, spicy salmon skin roll, uni, dragon maki, and/or grilled squid.  Quality is consistent."}
{"text":"The food is okay. The place is nothing special. The price isn't that cheap. You can get a better deals at other locations. I wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"I came here on a lunch date after seeing that the reviews weren't too bad. 

The portions for the lunch menu are rather small compared to other places. I recommend getting the sushi set on the menu rather than anything else because the rest are just not worth it in my opinion. The price is good for the portion. The quality of food itself is good. Salmons were fresh. The customer service was excellent-- my cup was never empty and there were always servers asking us if we were doing alright. 

All in all, I wouldn't mind coming back here again considering the location is convenient and the food is good. I wouldn't come here if I were expecting larger portions though."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii and Vegas, this is the WORST sushi I have ever ate! Prices are expensive for poor quality! Do NOT recommend it. TRUST ME! Service and utensils/plates were dirty ASF!"}
{"text":"I live right across the street from Sushi Sky and the amazing lunch pricing was always enticing when I walked past. Eventually the curiousity caved and my boyfriend and I decided to drop in for dinner.  The staff and chefs were friendly, greeting us at the door.  We came in for a weekday dinner, so the menu was pretty standard. Sashimi, sushi, rolls and some cooked foods. There wasn't too much variety to choose from aside from that.

Service was fast, all our items arrived quite promptly. I've been to other AYCE sushi places but unfortunately the quality here really seemed to be on the lower end. Within 10 minutes of eating we both weren't feeling great and by the 20 minute mark I found it hard to stomach more food. The white tuna tasted still frozen and the rolls had way too much rice and all the rolls had the exact same stuffing so in the end the rolls really all tasted the same.

The pricing is extremely reasonable and affordable but I don't think I would come again."}
{"text":"BEST DAMN SUSHI RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD !!!
This place is like a second home to me, I literally lived here this summer. Its tasty sushi for a damn good price. I get my usual, which is Dinner Special #4 which is only $13!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -  You get 6 pcs spicy mayo tuna/salmon - my favorite, i crave it everyday -, 6 pcs cali roll, miso soup, green salad (with their special house made sauce, which is to die for...they sell it for like $5 bucks for a medium size container I think), and a choice between gyoza or spring rolls. I usually get double salad instead of spring rolls and gyoza cause I go there for lunch almost everyday (sometimes even dinner) and I don't want to have an obesity issue. 
Don't be alarmed if the servers aren't talkative or \"nice\", they are honestly sweet people who have no desire to converse with you or look you in the eye for that matter. I love them. All of them!!

10% off take away, and they deliver till 1030pm I believe! The delivery guy is a sweetheart as well. 

OO and the green tea and mango ice cream is creamy and very satisfying !"}
{"text":"The waitress will stand by your table and watch you while you eat! Absolutely classless bunch. Also got a spider roll that was stuffed with crumbs and no crab! Waste of your money. Terrible experience. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price, my group and I got the dinner specials. Almost everything we had was good. The miso soup is absolutely incredible and I'm sad I didn't get a big one to go. The drinks are a little weak but they're inexpensive so that makes up for it. Our waiter was super attentive and nice, we got so much food we ended up having to take it home to enjoy later- even after we left in a semi food coma."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for close to 8 years now. It's always average but i would keep coming for the bento box while i was at school (good deal). Over the years, i've come here every once in a while, and i have to say, it's just an average sushi joint - but it has good memories for me. If you're in the area, stop by, but definitely, don't make an effort or go out of your way to eat here."}
{"text":"i came here for a quick lunch before shopping. my friend ate here once before and liked it so i wanted to check it out. 

i got the lunch set B which comes with miso soup and salad. i chose the beef teriyaki. it also comes with 3 pcs of cali roll. the beef was really fatty and the sauce had zero flavor. the salad was standard. the cali rolls were good but almost fell apart when i picked them up. 

we tried  the hakutsuru cold sake. it was easy to drink... but i'm not sure if i would order it again.

service was okay. the staff was talking quite loudly to each other in cantonese and it was kinda annoying. they were so close to each other but were talking as if they were yelling. they just happened to be closest to our table. 

the prices are suuuuuper cheap but u get what u pay for. go somewhere else and fork over the extra bucks for better food."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favourite sushi places, and I give it 5 stars, for one main reason: Lunch Special A - white tuna with green onions maki, salman and avocado maki, and salmon 'cakes'. Yummy - my mouth is watering just thinking about it!

It's a nice place as well - quick service, cheap prices, and nice booths for more relaxed conversation in the back."}
{"text":"Decent place. Went here for a AYCE dinner on a Friday evening ($20.99) and it was surprisingly not too busy (in comparison to sushi places along Bloor & Bathurst or Queen & Spadina).

The maki were not heavily filled with rice, and the sashimi & sushi pieces were all fresh. The fried calamari was a tad overcooked, but the shrimp tempura was flaky and yummy!
The service was good, waiter was shocked that 3 women can EAT & still have room for ice-cream.

Reasonable price, especially where it's located... but there are other better places downtown."}

Fairly standard 

Price: 3/5
Fairly standard for Japanese food.

Service: 1/5 
Stopped counting after the staff walks back and forth over 20 times, since there's barely anyone there. Felt like he was trying to rush me out. 

Overall thought: not coming back."}
{"text":"Sushi Sky used to be our favourite Sushi place for lunch.
Fast service, close to work, cute servers, cheap and tasty.

Then Takumi opened up 2 doors up Yonge and we frequented there for some time.  We went back to Sushi Sky yesterday and the quality was lacking in the food to the point of causing myself and my food-partner to get ourselves back to the office ASAFP for a watery treat in the bathroom.

The fish was a touch on the side of no-so-fresh anymore.  They only gave me a tiny bit of ginger, and the wasabi was weak.  We were asked if we wanted more tea only once, and the servers were grouchy.

Doubt it that we'll go back again.  But your mileage may vary!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food at a decent price. 

Not sure if related but my friend and I both were really tired about an hour after eating there which is unusual for 3pm. 

In conclusion, good sushi and bento at a good price but be careful of the sleeping powder."}
{"text":"I went to this sushi joint yesterday after playing a game at 401. I went in a group of 6/7 and we opted for the AYCE. We stocked up on the sashimi since that's what you do when you got AYCE! We got 40 pieces first and a lot of other things. The wait for the sashimi was a bit too long. I think we waited for 20 mins until it came. 

The price for AYCE is 20.99 before tax + tip. It was normal price I believe. I don't usually go for AYCE. The sashimi wasn't bad, it was OK. It didn't seem frozen. 

The sashimi, tempura, chicken wings and dragon roll was the best tasting dishes for me. I like the crunchiness of the tempura and it was bartered quite well. Dragon roll was not bad and I would order again. 

The service was decent. I would recommend to come back for AYCE. I'm accustomed to Vancouver sushi so this place ranks 7/10 for my Vancouver comparisons."}
{"text":"Came here years ago and it was my favourite sushi place in Toronto!  Don't know what it's like nowadays but absolutely loved the sushi boats.  Would love to go again!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Budget sushi at its finest. Call ahead, pick it up and save yourself 10%.

You've been to Sushi Sky, even if you haven't. This is but one of Toronto's numerous budget sushi places run by non-Japanese owners, and whilst that may sound like a dig, it's really more the norm than anything else. This is probably one of the better ones out there, but to be honest, at this price range, they're almost all the same to me. What you want is a cheap, fairly fresh sushi and a non-intrusive atmosphere to enjoy your meal with friends. This place has got in in spades. It may not impress your date, but it'll likely get you a second...especially if you take her down the street to Volo afterwards for some delicious beers."}
{"text":"Ordered the 'buffet' and got less than half of what we ordered.  It was horrible.  Left hungry.  Sad place.  I will never return."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has gotten four stars!! ...The other reviewers did get something right. This place is cheap ...too bad EVERYTHING about this place is cheap.

The staff are rude and the food is awful. Not even necessary to endure, considering Kokyo Japanese Cuisine is just across the way.

Kokyo does cost a little bit more, but worth the trip across the street."}
{"text":"Good prices and sufficient space for stroller. Enjoyed the sushi platter. Close to the subway."}
{"text":"Good: Sushi is decent and VERY cheap, especially at lunch. Portions are decent.

Bad: The cooked food is awful.

Ugly: The wait staff need to work on their manners.."}
{"text":"I ate here on the last day in Toronto, Canada in 2013.

I'm a big fan of sushi and the quality was perfect, very tasty and nice food! The employees were very friendly.

the open kitchen was fun to was, very clean also.

If I ever be in Toronto again, I'll come visit this place again for sure!"}
{"text":"The horror. Avoid, avoid, avoid. I have nothing good to say about this place. The menu offers a run of the mill mainstream sushi selection. This hardly qualifies as Japanese food. We found a shrimp shell in one of our rolls, right in the centre piece, and the server told us that's how the roll is supposed to be. When we asked for spicy mayo, to help us get through the awful \"sushi\", the server said it'll be an extra dollar or two. 
The service was terrible, the server acted like he was doing us a favour. 
Not sure why people like this place, a real sushi lover would know this isn't sushi.
If you notice, most of the five star reviews for this place are speaking to the price rather than the food."}
{"text":"Ordered the dinner bento box. Miso soup was plain, sushi was not fresh as expected nor were rolls balanced. Rice and sashimi was slightly dry too. Tables smelled like wiped soy sauce and a fruit fly was buzzing around. On cold days, sit far away from windows since there was a cold draft. Service and staff were decent thankfully"}
{"text":"I really don't understand why people like this place so much.  They offer the standard bento boxes and sushi platter.  The service is ok but folks, there are so many other places in the area.  And there's also Takumi two doors north of it."}
{"text":"Meh, it wasn't awful but it wasn't great. I was in the mood for a bento box for some strange reason and just happened to come across Sushi Sky. I got one with some teriyaki chicken, a few dumplings, and some sushi. The teriyaki was pretty bad. It was just a whole lot of grease and I started regretting my bento box desires three or four bites in. I don't think I'd come back here again. The staff was very fast and attentive and it wasn't too expensive, but I just wasn't digging the food."}
{"text":"3 stars. This place is okay. I wasn't blown away by anything in particular and the quality of the sushi, sashimi, and cooked items from the kitchen isn't the greatest. There's a large variety of items on the menu but I didn't see anything unique. 

I usually always start any AYCE sushi meal with a miso soup which was quite good here. The sashimi items tasted fresh but the octopus was still a bit icy which I didn't like so much. I always order and feast on enoki beef rolls but they were just mediocre here - the enoki didn't taste fresh and lost that bounce it usually has when you eat it. Service was okay - for some reason the waiters kept giving us more than what we wrote down (e.g. we ordered 2 pieces of takoyaki but they gave us 5) - this happened a few more times with other items. We didn't mind so much because we were really hungry, but it annoyed us toward the end when we had a bunch of extra food items we didn't order but unfortunately had to finish. 

Overall this place is okay/decent."}
