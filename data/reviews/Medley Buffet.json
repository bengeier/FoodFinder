{"text":"I've eaten at many buffets in LV.  I just don't know why, but any buffet that is North of the strip just isn't up to par at all.  And the Medley at Aliante is no exception.  First of all, at breakfast and lunch (not including weekends and holidays) there is virtually no line.  Great if you're hungry and can't wait to eat something.  The service staff seems to be really good and their personalities are really good.

That is basically the good part, with a few exceptions.  One of the first things you see upon entering is the huge soup and salad bar, with the fruit prominently displayed.  It looks awful.  All the melons are cut in different sizes and looks worse than if my 6 year old grandkid got hold of a knife and started cutting.  The tables and booths are of decent size and comfort.  Usually go to buffets at lunch, as that is my big meal of the day.  Went for some soup and tried the minestrone.  The flavor was ok, but the pieces of vegetables were much bigger than the spoon.  The salad bar itself seemed stocked with the usual ingredients but no bell peppers.   Everything down to the prepared salads seemed to be prepackaged.  Went over to the Mexican section which had some small but decent tamales, menudo, fajita fixings, taco fixings and the salsa bar.  Most of it tasted blah!  Went to the American, wow, they had my least favorite fish again, tilapia!  Carving station had beef and turkey.  The Italian had some dried up baked pasta dish, pizza with lousy crust, spaghetti + meatballs, sausage and peppers and marinara sauce that was so watery it wouldn't stay on the meatballs.

The Chinese section had a variety of foods that my diet couldn't handle so I stayed away.  At the BBQ section they had pulled pork, kielbasa, hot dogs and hamburgers that were not cooked to order but tasty and they had a decent no-bean chili that tasted ok and French fries and corn bread.  There was a decent selection of deserts but no vanilla sauce for the bread pudding.  The NSA deserts had very little variety, but sometimes they put out the cookies which taste ok.  The coffee is pretty decent.

All in all you get what you pay for I guess.  Would not have a problem paying a little extra for better quality food and presentation.  Seems like all the food workers don't take pride in their cooking because the food almost always looks like it was just dumped in a serving plate and put out."}
{"text":"I went there for the breakfast buffet. Lots of food. The carving station was excellent. Fruit was fresh and the waffles were delicious. Out server was always available for re-fills and clearing dishes away. The discount with the Alliente card was excellent. I would like to try the dinner buffet next."}
{"text":"I went to the French Market for the all you can eat BBQ beef ribs.   First of all, even though they call it BBQ it's not.  The ribs are roasted in an oven, and then just before serving the cook slathers some BBQ sauce on the ribs, puts them on the fire for 60 seconds and then serves them.  There is no BBQ flavor, no smoke, no spice rub, no falling off the bone tender.  They don't give you a steak knife so eating them is a pain.  The ribs have been cut so that the only meat is the little strip of meat between the bones.  Very disappointing - but all you can eat - for about $10 if you are a member of the players club.   

The salad bar had the bare minimum ingredients to call it a salad.

The deserts were more looks than taste.  Tasteless meringue in the lemon meringue pie, tasteless pumpkin pie, cannolli with barely any filling.  Best desert was the cream puff.

There are much better buffets in LV (but they don't have beef ribs)."}
{"text":"Prime rib that melts in your mouth.
And a good price with your connected card.
Vegas really is a foodie paradise"}
{"text":"Friday Night Seafood
I'm just not that enthusiastic about this place as my 1st two visits. Tonight was the Seafood Buffet for $17.99 with $1 off with players card. The oysters were absolutely scary looking. I've never seen oysters look so dried and shriveled up before. And there was a large bowl loaded with them. But we were happy with the salmon, the king crab, snow crab, shrimp, craw fish, mussels and clams. But not so impressed with the $37 we paid for this. We could have gotten the same things at Asia Buffet for $28 and enjoyed the oysters and a larger sushi selection. The desserts here deserve 5 stars because they all are very delicious. I have no complaints. 

I'll be back.... just not for Friday night seafood. Any other time I want to say will be my money's worth."}
{"text":"Has been eat in at the Orleans Casino French Market Buffet for quite some time now.  I can confidently say it is one of the most consistent buffet in Las Vegas. Their food selections r quite fresh n huge! With your typical basic Salad Bars, Mexican, Chinese, Italian, American, BBQ n Seafood and also an above average dessert section with Cakes, Pies, Gelatos, Soft Cones n some French Finger Pastries. I believe Wicked Spoon n Studio B is still the reigning chanp of dessert decadence! But Orlean's French Market Buffet is still one of the few most value honest deal buffet in Las Vegas! Your hard earn dollars will go along way by eat in here!"}
{"text":"This will be a shorter review than what I usually write. This buffet sucks. Truly. The BBQ station serves sour cream, horseradish & another sour cream that's lumpy. Instead of labeling it sour cream/horseradish mix they call it sour cream. Desserts are dry. The carrot cake especially.  There's a breakfast station too, although I couldn't find it. Everything I had was bland, dry or had a funky taste to it: chili tasted like corn, dumplings bland & dry, same with fried rice. Someone in my group found it & he took one bite of scrambled eggs & pushed his plate away. I'm not a buffet person but have been to a few that are actually good. This isn't one of them. It's easily the worst in town. I stopped for lunch elsewhere after \"lunch\" here. Servers were nice & attentive."}
{"text":"Best off strip buffet in town.  If you're looking for all the choices and flavors of the bigger casinos but want a better price and less crowds then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"We had 3 ruby players cards for our family of 5 adults and my son and for my son they wouldn't do the discount of $5. We told the cashier and she wouldn't do it. The service was average. 

The food was good but not excellent. I liked the shrimp, crab, and other foods but their fruit was unripe.

The price was reasonable for its food which I liked. Each adult is $21.99.(kids older than 8 are full price)"}
{"text":"This was the first time I'd been to this buffet. Went for dinner and it wasn't bad for the price. Plenty of selections. Soft serve was a little too sweet, but there are plenty of other options."}
{"text":"In town for the WCC basketball tournament and did not want to drive and hunt.  Decided to try the buffet and the price seemed okay.  $56 for two -- whoa!  Turns out I guess I missed the fact that it was Seafood Night.  Too bad because I am not that big a fan of oysters and Alaska King Crab legs which were flying off the serving trays.  The food was okay for buffet food.  I was served a thick slice of roast ham and there was a wide variety of food overall, but I never did find the fried chicken."}
{"text":"Grossest buffet I have ever been to! After seeing a nasty wirey white hair in the chorizo, I thought I was going to throw up. Then a lady came around me and grabbed a bunch of them on her plate, I was going to tell her but I froze because of shock.  I tried to force my self to eat since I was starving, but just couldn't do it. The price was $7.99 per person and supposedly included champagne but we were never offered any and no one around us had any so we just assumed it it was just the name for a breakfast during the weekend.  The price was low enough for me to just sit there and drink coffee while my hubby had a plate of french toast and an omelet. We went to eat elsewhere right after since I hadn't eaten. The staff is rude but what do you except from a cheap buffet. They couldn't pay me enough to step foot in there again, well maybe a million dollars, ha ha. It sure does remind you that paying more for quality food and service is worth it."}
{"text":"No great stand outs here. Nothing that I wanted to go back for - sad. Crab, crayfish, salmon (maybe the best item I ate), ribs - bland, prime rib - overcooked.  Desserts were run of the mill high production type desserts.  My lemon meringue pie meringue was so hard I couldn't cut it without a knife."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness my mouth is watering just thinking about this buffet

Its located in New Orleans, a little off the strip, but it is well worth the drive. The price is unbelievable! $7.99 for lunch on a weekday! For a buffet! With seafood! and steak and dessert! I don't understand how they are even making a profit!

For seafood, they have fish, crayfish, shrimp and KING CRAB LEGS. They have a variety of american food (steak, mac n cheese, grilled cheese), chinese food, mexican food, italian food (pasta, lasagna, pizza), BBQ (mongolian BBQ and baby back ribs) and over 25 varieties of desserts. 

Everytime I go to Vegas, I come here and eat my heart out like a little fatty. 

Highly recommended for a casual lunch and a great cure for hangovers :)"}
{"text":"Better than most buffets.. The lunch time hamburger bar and seafood night are awesome. The decor and service is top notch"}
{"text":"Went here for the Sunday champagne brunch. My family and I paid $13.99 per person. And we were promptly seated. There is quite a variety of food. There are smoked salmon, primed ribs, crab cakes, breakfast foods (i.e. blintz, pancakes, waffles, and bacon), an Asian food station (i.e. Kung Pao chicken), cheeses, a Mexican food station (with churros!), an omlette station, some crab legs, shrimp, veggies and fruits, and finally, dessert. Overall, the food tastes great. I love it. The only things I do not like are: 1) the tiny, cheap, plastic champagne glasses and 2) the infrequency of waiters/waitresses coming around asking if we were okay or if we needed anything. I waited forever to ask for more coffee or champagne. I wish there were more waiters or waitresses going around. And they also take a while to take our plates. But I am willing to look over these things because my tummy is nice and full because of French Market Buffet. And yes, I am willing to go there again."}
{"text":"We went to the French Market Buffet on Christmas day.  We were looking for a good buffet, off the strip, without the 2 hour wait in line.  We were in line before the 1100 opening.   At the carver's station the roast turkey was very good.  The ham was very watery, like it was boiled or steamed.  At the other ethnic stations, the food appeared to be from the day before.  The mexican refried beans were old-looking.  Mind you we we at the start of the lunch buffet.  You could get breakfast, and the scrambled eggs were freshly made, but room temperature.   The steam table temperatures were not hot.

End result two of us got sick

The waiter service was great.  

Bad show for such a special occasion."}
{"text":"Much better than we thought! We came here after getting married in Vegas and to our surprise it was amazing! The day before we came by to check if they take reservations and were surprised to find out they did! It worked out perfectly. Another amazing thing, we came on Octoberfest day so the price was only $10 a head! Amazing! It is like the Rio World Buffet but for a third of the price! Now I will admit it does not have all the selections of Rio but it was just as good! I do highly recommend you coming here for cheap but good buffet with a good variety!"}
{"text":"I love the renovation!! It looks very modern and cute. $20 for the dinner on a Sunday is a great deal! The steak was the best buffet steak I've had in a while. They definitely expanded for the better, and their staff is very friendly. I had Kathy our server and she was so nice. She made sure our glasses were full and she always cleared our plates as soon as we were done. She really made the experience a lot better. I would recommend the dinner, the food was hot and fresh. Definitely my new favorite buffet in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have been to this buffet Handful of times for breakfast and once for dinner.

I'm giving this buffet four stars based upon overall value, service, and decor.
The prices are great. Example: $5.99 for breakfast with players card. Service has always been great. The restaurant is spacious, modern, and overall attractive setting. 
The food pretty decent, stick to the cooking stations and fresh foods. Does it compare to the Wynn buffet or Wicked spoon? No, you get what you pay for. It is was it is, accept for what it is and you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"This buffet was pretty bad. The food was edible but that's the nicest thing I can say.

The staff was slow and rude. The price was 15.99 but it was more in line with a 9.99 buffet. They even had the nerve to charge $10 for a two year old child. 

The orange juice tasted fake and they were so slow to refill our drinks. 

At one point my two year-old spilled her drink. A staff seemed annoyed to bring me one dry towel before walking away.

I would not return here again."}
{"text":"Great food diversity. Delicious and a lot of choices. I just would like to know why it takes so long if there is more than 50 tables available and the line still growing? Also a child under 12 shouldn't pay full price for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. It ha decent variety of food and snacks. One negative is that it open at 8am and those of us on business trip need to eat earlier."}
{"text":"I don't think so. 

This \"buffet\" is probably one of the worst buffets I've ever eaten at. The food was bland, the staff was rowdy, and the utensils were dirty. When you eat corn that tastes like nothing, you know this is a waste of 14 dollars. 

Just don't come here at all."}
{"text":"The $11 weekday lunch buffet at Orleans Casino is an excellent value. Delicious prime rib and ham. Great deserts selections as well with 12 flavors of premium ice cream."}
{"text":"We will keep this one simple Went on two different nights, comped so we thought we would take advantage. Seafood night was somewhat phoned in. It just strikes me as an old folks home buffet. Bland and brown. Oh well if it's free it's worth it.
The stars are all for the service."}
{"text":"3.5
Been here a ton of times...with tax it's only $7.45 or something like that for the breakfast..show up near the end of it and you get to eat all the lunch stuff as it comes out.  It's not the best buffet but when it comes to getting your moneys worth it might be! I prefer this place over the Caesars dinner actually....the best deal on the strip is probably the $35 unlimited buffet for 24 hours offering 7 different casinos...PH. Cesars, Imperial, Paris, Harrahs, Rio and a couple others...but if are in the hole from gambling bad, the buffet at Orleans is a good way to feel like you won some of it back."}
{"text":"French Market Buffet is located in The Orleans Casino Hotel. I had the Saturday Champagne Brunch for approx. $10/person. (There is a $1 discount if you have their player's card.) After seating me, the waitress promptly took my drink order.  You can order champagne from the waitress but I chose not to drink the champagne.  

Buffet food selection:
French Market Buffet offers a selection of food ranging from American to Asian.  As expected, the selection is not as grand as buffets located on the Strip; however, there was a good variety of food for the price paid.  The food was reasonably tasty.

There is also an omelet bar (my fav!) where one can order an omelet with ingredients that include ham, sausages, bacon, cheese, green peppers, mushrooms, etc.  My omelet was delectable!

Desserts:
The coconut macaroons and chocolate cake was super delicious.

The waitress refilled my drink without me asking.  The facility was clean and well-kept.  Overall, I had a pleasant experience and will return mainly for the price."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst food I have ever eaten in my entire life. The roast beef tasted like they put poultry seasoning on it the chinese food was over deep fried and when I finally tried the prime rib it tasted like it was rotten. The only good thing on the buffet was the Mexican food and the desserts were good. I stayed at the Orleans for a month and I wouldn't give them another dime to eat there that horrible buffet could be complimentary with your stay and I still wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"I was there for the Christmas brunch. The crab was good, the selection of dessert was vast, and the coffee was great with the dessert. Everything else was... meh... But at this price, there's not much you can complain about."}
{"text":"went here for Sunday brunch. For about $15 per person quality should b better. The pork ribs tasted like it was re-heats. Osso bucco was tender but sauce it up so it looks appetizing  not like it was  the heat lamp all day, the sad thing was we were here when it just opened. Crawfish and ham were good, desserts looked good but I was lo carbing it. I'm not a salad person but the grilled veges, cheese platter at sPalad bar was nice. Maybe the m resort spoiled me, but was not impressed With the orleans buffet ."}
{"text":"This Review is for the Friday Seafood Buffet. $ 18.00 per person 
Peel and Eat Shrimp, Hot and Cold Crab Legs, Tuna in Dill Sauce, Fried Shrimp Patties, Craw-fish, Clams, Oysters on the half shell, Salmon on a wooden plank, and several additional seafood selections. Many traditional Buffet items were also to be found. 
Average quality seafood with poor to average preparation. Some items were over fried and tough - other fried items were barely cooked enough. Crab-legs were small - ensuring lots of work. A seafood stew was mainly mushrooms. The Clam Chowder soup was very thick with only a promise of clams. The Seafood Buffet was Pricey for the quality of the food. Very good service by the wait staff. 

I would suggest this buffet for Breakfast or Lunch - or even better with a Comp or Coupon.

If you're playing tables always ask the Pit Boss for a comp - they will rarely(if ever) volunteer one. On Slots ask the Players Club what it takes - Before you spend your money here."}
{"text":"First, let me say that I'm not one to eat at a buffet, sorely because i lose my appetite when I see piles of foods on trays lined up from one end of the wall to another.

I was forced (yes, forced!) to go here with my family - party of 8 with two toddlers. Usually, for big parties wiith messy toddlers, the host would normally sit you in the corner away from other gobbling patrons, but not our case. we were just a few feet away from the food, yet not too close from foot traffic.
(that's 1 star)

The buffet, being in the Orleans casino, serves southren food (among other \"international theme\") - from crawfish to hush puppies. They also have cooked and raw oysters. Not bad for a $20. The only drawback is the desert section - they dont have much to offer tehre. But then again, I get stuffed easily and usually dont have much room for sweet shutffs.
(that's 2 stars)

This is no Rio buffet, so there's really not much waiting. However, being that it was graduation week, there were a lot of locals with their graduating kids (still on their cap n gown). Stilll, we only waited for about 8 minutes.
(that's 1 star)

I got a bad impression of our server at first because instead of neatly placing our silverwares on the table, she would just toss it from the other end of the table, so I had to catch my fork as bouncess across the table. 
(that's -1 star)"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for 4 days and ate here twice.
First time was for breakfast, a decent selection of stuff to choose from; you have fruit, waffles, pancakes, bacon, sausage (normal breakfast foods). Nothing to spectacular on that end considering the biscuits and gravy they had was below my expectations (gravy lacked flavor almost as if they were afraid to make that traditional peppery white gravy you crave with biscuits and gravy), drink service was also a little slow but it was to be expected for a Saturday. But then you get to the desserts which were available during breakfast; not only did they have donuts but they also had cake and pie. I'm a sweets fanatic but have a pretty severe nut allergy and the lady working there (I can't remember her name but super sweet and a little older lady with brown hair in a bun) was very understanding of that and gave me a full list of everything with nuts, cooked near nuts, and may possibly be contaminated with nuts. I was pretty happy with that since I got a fresh slice of the most delicious peach caramel cake I've ever eaten and convinced me to give the buffet another go but at lunch to see if it was better than breakfast.
Second time was for lunch and lets say I was left feeling a little disappointed. The cooks  behind the buffet prepping food didn't seem to know much about the foods and had to go track down other chefs to ask if anything contained nuts or was cooked in peanut oil; while nothing was prepared in peanut oil other foods \"could have nuts\". Disappointing since they couldn't name anything that had nuts at all and I had to guess at what would or wouldn't be safe to try and eat. The lunch options were not very impressive either, the fried fish was kind of \"meh\" the pasta at the American station was very oily/greasy almost as if they had only boiled the noodles and melted butter onto them. Italian food left A LOT to be desired, the pizza wasn't very great but even bad pizza is good pizza, but there were not many pasta options. Plain noodles and only meat or marina sauce, a few options for various different pastas (none of which really stood out) and one sad looking vegetable lasagna. Drinks this time were quicker to arrive and be refilled. And then we get to desserts, whoever makes these do a superb job and they ladies who work in that area (the one from Saturday was there again) are the nicest workers I have ever met. They saved what would have been a disappointing lunch with the offering of a delicious blueberry cheesecake that I had two pieces of.

Overall: very average quality food offerings, except desserts those are superb; but the price is pretty decent compared to the other buffets."}
{"text":"No difference between the meals at this buffet and any of the other $8 - $11 casino buffets.  Line is usually short during breakfast and lunch during the week.  Earns four stars instead of three because the staff has always been great when I've eaten here."}
{"text":"I used to go to this Buffet when I lived closer but haven't been here probably in 5-6 years at least. I usually figure a buffet is a buffet and know what to expect. Last night, this place was just a big MEH! Most of the food tasted exactly the same as other items and some of it was less than appealing in it's presentation. I'm also not a big Prime Rib fan but I do at least like it to not be smiling at me. It was clean inside and looked nice.
The service was great and friendly, which is unusual for a buffet. I won't be back soon."}
{"text":"Great buffet with affordable pricing. It is the most expensive on Friday nights so a way to save money is do lunch or a late lunch before they switch to dinner pricing at 4 but stop letting people in for lunch at 3. They have a bbq, italian, mexican, american, chinese, seafood, and mongolian/Hawaiian station plus desert.  It's fresh and good quality.  Not as good as some of the more pricey buffets but for a $9.99 lunch it beats the $35 buffets anyday. Make sure to get a player card for a better price."}
{"text":"Decent lunch buffet, with variety. Good price. Tried the beef brisket and ribs, which got great reviews from others--good flavor, but lots of fat on them. Most of the food was bland.
Definitely save room for the dessert bar. Deep-dish pecan pie was quite tasty. Oreo cake was good too."}
{"text":"I don't expect much from buffets because I've been disappointed so many times. I went at 4pm for the seafood buffet which was way overpriced. I paid 86.00 for four people including a 6 year old child. There are no discounts on seafood night for children. I also had a players card. I thought the food was okay. I did enjoy the variety of desserts (sugar-free). Overall I think you should go when you're really really hungry and feel like splurging. It  wasn't amazing but it wasn't horrible. It was like \"eh\"."}
{"text":"Last night me and my husband and 2 years old little girl had a dinner there. I was surprised that they charged for 2 years old kid. $9.99 for 2 years old kid. And mine was $10.99. Only $1 cheaper than mine? She didn't eat at all. Only had couple piece of fruit."}
{"text":"After a canceled flight, I wound up spending my airline meal vouchers here for dinner and a breakfast. The prices for dinner change daily, depending on the night's theme cuisine. My night was BBQ and it cost about $15.

Like a lot of sub $20 buffets, the food offerings here need to be attacked with a strategy in mind. I have my own system for deciding what to pick, but the most important buffet rule is to immediately stop eating anything that isn't GOOD. There's a lot of crap at this buffet and a lot of stuff that's so-so, but there's some real good stuff to be eaten, as long as you're not busy chowing down on dried-out, fake, instant, imitation, bland funk.

I found the roasted chicken to be excellent, like actually worthy of being on a plate being served in a regular restaurant. The crawdads were unique and it was my first time trying them. I didn't care for the taste, but I don't have anything to compare them to, so I switched over to the peel and eat shrimp. The salad bar was decent enough. The bread pudding was amazingly good. The service sucked, as my water was never refilled, I had to scrounge for a second napkin, and at one point my table was totally cleared while I was up getting more food.

Breakfast was about $8. The OJ was fake and tasted funny. The coffee was not bad, but not good. Skip scrambled eggs as they're fake too. Instead, get your eggs off the top off the Benedict offerings. You don't want to eat the whole Benedict, just the egg, as the rest is gross. I have a weakness for cheap-o breakfast sausage with syrup on top and I wasn't disappointed. Don't bother hoping for a nice pastry to pair with your last cup of coffee because they're all pretty horrible.

Overall, FMB is worth the price it seems, but don't think you're going to get the variety of a full buffet, as most of the food is no good. Be picky and search out the few gems to be found, then jump in with both feet."}
{"text":"This buffet has gone downhill. The overall prices without discounts are 21.99, which is not worth your money because the food is less than ok. The fish tastes like its been frozen for months and the pastas are watery or too dry... the Chinese and Mexican food were ok and the American food was worse than mediocre. The desserts were good, especially the gelato. Overall, don't come here to eat unless you are dying of starvation!"}
{"text":"Ive eaten at a lot of the buffet's in Vegas, but this one at The Orleans is the best. All of their food was great, and I don't think I came across anything that i did not like. Service was also amazing, never had an empty glass. I definitely recommend this place! I will be coming back."}
{"text":"My review is pretty much the same as the others. Would be nice if they were open a little later than 9. Busy enjoying your time and cut it close getting there by 9. Will eat there again."}
{"text":"Avoid this place....the only thing good was the omelette & beef ribs. Bland fried rice, salty biscuits & gravy, & a cardboard tasting rice Krispy treats."}
{"text":"Bad, bad, bad.  Poor service, flavor was off on almost all of the food, we both ended up with a horrid stomach ache the next day.  Quantity  Quality. This place is overpriced for what they offer."}
{"text":"The Orleans is always a place I like to frequent when I am in Vegas.  For some reason, I find their buffet to be a good value, and call me crazy, but they make a crazy-good tuna salad!! Yes, of all those options (including crawfish-not for me), I return again and again for some of that tuna!  Not the biggest or brightest buffet, but I am still a fan and will return each and every time."}
{"text":"I used to like this buffet for value.  However, after my recent stay at the Orleans and 2 visits to the buffet, I need to update my review.   I thought the first time was a fluke. In the past, I never noticed them  putting out food that is way past it's prime.  However, there were several items I used to enjoy that should have gone into a compost bin rather than being served as food.  Watermelon and some items at the salad bar were especially disappointing since I had enjoyed them in the past. My boyfriend is the meat eater, and he said the quality of the meat had gone down too.

The pricer Sunday brunch was the most pleasant of the meals we had.   The free champagne, which wasn't bad, helped make the experience more enjoyable.  They had better fruit on Sunday, and had a  chocolate fountain to dip fruit, rice krispy treats, macaroons and marshmallows in.   

I never cared for the cakes and pies at the French Market Buffet.  They are pretty, but like most Vegas buffet desserts, they taste like they use a cheap oil instead of butter.  The cobbler is usually good, and so is their ice cream and gelato.

We always like the servers and tip them even if the quality of the food is bad.  It is not their fault."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband for brunch on Saturday morning and we had the server Marcelo. He probably was the worst server I've ever had there. Took his time clearing our table when I watched him he was much quicker getting to the older couples and smiled much more around them. He seemed at when talking to us. Never checked on us once while eating. Never brought us napkins. Idk if it's because we are young, but I work in the service industry and I tip very well. It's not right to stereotype."}
{"text":"The most horrible food quality - save your money. Dont know how anybody could give this place the many positive reviews seen here."}
{"text":"Steak night buffet cost $21 + tax . The food and services were ok. I liked bean sup , it taste very good. Weekend come here with friend eating and gambling . Happpppyyyyy if you win..,,,,"}
{"text":"For someone that enjoys the Vegas buffets and has been to 50 of them this is by far the worst one in did not like any of the food the clientele where the worst I have ever experience, if you want a cheap Buffett try Fremont."}
{"text":"Fairly good food.  Unpeeled shrimp.  No turkey.   Good breakfast stuff still out at noon. Would not be my first choice, but not to bad.  Overall the hotel and casino are fine.  Other restaurants  here are very good."}
{"text":"Probably the most food I've wasted at a buffet and I hate wasting food.  Quality was not good as a few things were inedible.  Chewy shredded hash browns, hard coated chicken fried steak, face clenching sour pineapples, and overly fat and greasy sausage.  Now at $7.50 you would think it is a value meal but I would not come back if it was free."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere for a good price.  Drawbacks: Very crowded, which is actually a good sign.  We ate here for lunch 3/5 days one week b/c that is where we received tickets from training.  Worth the price. Good presentation.  Good food.  The only negative food experience was the roast beef was a bit bloody for me, but I just didn't eat it."}
{"text":"Went here at the French Market buffet in the Orleans for lunch on a Christmas Monday, didn't have to wait long. Everything looks and tastes fresh. I especially love the Korean short ribs and rotisserie chicken which they served! They are both to die for! Would love to come back for more. Please save me a seat. Thank u. Almost forgot to mention. The cost is average! Only $10 per person without club card. Worth every pennies. So, What are u waitin for?"}
{"text":"As some others have been saying, the terrible quality of this place may be due to it being under construction. But it is, as it stands now, terrible. Food is close to cafeteria quality. We went for brunch, and upon trying the eggs and sausage, I found both to be undercooked. The eggs were so runny it was unbelievable. One of the two gave me food poisoning, so here I am 24 hours later, missing out on my vacation because I'm now confined to my hotel room. I rarely use Yelp for anything other than checking reviews people have already left, but I was angry enough to make an account and write this one up myself!"}
{"text":"I find it hard to believe that this isn't the best Buffet deal in Vegas.  Once again, had breakfast this moring and it was out of this world!  The custom omeletes, made to order, are just as good if not better than the ones for $35 on nthe strip.  The cooks and staff are always very friendly and make this a fantastic place to start your day.  Along with my omelete I had fresh watermelon and honeydew melon and fresh baked cookies to dip in my cofee.  Try it and you will see."}
{"text":"For 12.97, pretty damn good food. I also didn't eat for like 6 hours before that so that can be a factor. No complaints.  4 stars because nothing stood out too far to be a 5. But it was damn well delicious. Too bad they have no cookie dough ice cream. I'll be all over that shit  . The egg drop soup though was a little bland and tasted too much like baby corn. 

I was a satisfied customer ."}
{"text":"The buffet is arranged into nine serving stations. They include the soup & salad bar and the Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Mongolian Barbecue, American, Seafood, BBQ and the dessert bar.

I have eaten here many times. The food is not outstanding but there is plenty of variety and I can always find things here that I like. The salad bar recently had marinated artichoke hearts which is a big plus for me. The beef ribs are meaty, tender and flavorful. And you can gorge yourself on the shrimp and crayfish. And numerous other offerings keep me returning. I found the dessert bar to be just so-so but overall it's a good buffet. And I'd have to say that the prices make it one of the best buffet values in town. If you present a B-Connected card which is free from the Orleans casino, you'll save an extra dollar on the buffet. The same card is valid at all Boyd Gaming properties."}
{"text":"The brother casino has a better buffet for a cheaper price. Lines here are longer and food is okay. Not coming back as there is better for cheaper with a free shuttle!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here - way out in the high north central part of Las Vegas. The buffet room itself is very impressive looking: classy, large, beautifully decorated. Breakfast opens at 7AM. The staff was welcoming and very friendly. Customer activity apparently starts off slowly after opening for breakfast. Table service was excellent and food was neatly arranged and visually appealing. The place was immaculate clean. Breakfast offerings were fairly standard with a slightly above average selection. Food quality was above average. No one should have a problem assembling a decent breakfast here. 

It looks like a well-run operation in fairly upscale and relaxing surroundings. I hope this great-looking facility develops into a busier operation as development in the area continues and customer traffic increases."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth 22 bucks only reason im eating here is that it was comped my wife almost broke a tooth on some chicken no seafood salad which is cheap to make"}
{"text":"Have been in Vegas for 5 days and the Orleans is right down the road.  We've eaten at the buffet 3 times and have enjoyed the lunch and dinner.  The staff is always checking for drinks and keeping the table clean. Ate 90% salad bar and loved the selections. Found the smoked ribs and that became our desert. Really tasty. Ate at 2 of there other properties and would give the Gold Coast a three star and the Main Street a two star."}
{"text":"So I'm a fan of breakfast, aren't you?
Well, $7.99 per person & all you can eat :D
Mon-Sat 7am-10pm
Sun 8am-10pm
I came in around 9:45am & was lucky to get some lunch food with purchasing the breakfast price. (useful information, don't you agree?) ;)
So on with the food... Yes, it does the stomach good. Chocolate waffles, make your own omelet, unlimited bacon. Yum!
And the perfect drink to compliment your breakfast: O.J.
There's a lot of selections and a fruit/dessert bar is available also.
This place isn't one for top-notch, but it satisfies my pocket and tummy."}
{"text":"Over priced! You don't get what you pay for! This is the first and maybe the last time I eat here! Instant mashed potatoes and the wine was horrible!!!! There's more , but it'd take all day to name all the bad and cheap food! 
I will say that the service was good!"}
{"text":"4 stars for great value in terms of price vs quality and selection among near-strip buffets. Removing one star for making me poop longer than usual. But adding a star for nice decor. Removing another star for making me look fat. I'd also subtract couple stars for putting me into food comma for 2 hours, which makes this place a little more expensive as time is money. But the overall experience was very good and I'm giving it 5 stars to negate older reviews posted before remodeling, as this place now deserves much better rating.
Anyway, I wasn't aware of the recent remodeling and was nicely surprised when visiting for Christmas Day dinner.  I usually don't care for expensive remodels that are often used to increase the price, but in this case it worked somewhat well and the Orleans buffet now deserves the place among the top buffets in Vegas, even though still far from perfect. There are no crab legs (except Friday nights) and therefore this buffet cannot be compared to the best ones that do serve them. Yet, the price reflects the lack of crab legs and justifies rating this location among the top of those that do not have them. The food quality and selection makes this place among the top 5 in Vegas on my list, little behind Bacchanal, M, and Wicked Spoon, while beating all of them on price.
I was especially surprised with ribs, which were better than those served in many restaurants. They had good selection of other meats, although some could've been added only for Christmas. Green beans, sweet potatoes, and other vegetables were fresh and cooked well. Lots of other selections from various cuisines, at least during Christmas Day. Some things that I would like to see added would be mushrooms and au gratin potatoes. Desert selection not as amazing as top buffets but still along better ones in Vegas. The holiday price was the same as the regular price during nights and weekends ($19 with rewards card), therefore I'm assuming that the selection and quality may be similar every day.
Nice decor and friendly waiter further helped providing great experience."}
{"text":"I love this buffet for one reason - all you can eat crab legs for less than $20 on Friday nights!  If you get the players card you can save $1/person.  Most of the other food on the buffet is mediocre - but if you love crab legs as much as I do you don't have any problem!  Great price!"}
{"text":"The Orleans and Boyd did spend at lot of money to renovate the buffet.  It's too bad they put all the money into the building instead of the food.  About 5 years ago the food was good.  No I can't believe it passes the state requirements.  None of the hot food was hot.  All the food was bland.  The hubby loves the Mexican food at most buffets but everything here he said was cold and tasteless.  We had a buy one get one deal so at least it only cost us half to be so disappointed.
We will not be returning to this Boyd establishment."}
{"text":"This is our go to buffet for. weeknights don't want to cook.  The food is presented nicely but quality and taste is inconsistent from visit to visit.  Since it has become a boyd property the carved beef is not as tender or flavorful and the dessert area has less variety and not kept up as before. The staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"SO and i visited today - another freebie...overall, we liked it....even if we had to pay, i think it's worth the money...$15/ person

plus - free glass of wine...sure it's table wine...but it's drinkable
           bbq foods - ribs, pork and beef, pork loin, sausage
           variety - like most casino buffets - about 7 food stations -               bbq, seafood, mongolian ( yes...they say mongolian
            but i did not try any of the foods at this station ) chinese, 
         mexican, italian, etc
         decent variety of desserts

minus - steak ( it was steak night ) - allegedly ny steak...hmmm
               it ain't high quality, but i don't expect high quality !!!

the drink server - very pleasant and attentive

i would call it a \"2nd tier\" buffet, but it's one of the better 2nd tier places ( it's comparable to the green valley and red rock station casino's )

Enjoy !"}
{"text":"Very good. Here for easter brunch. One issue is they dont have chicken gumbo this morning. They had it yesterday. Still give 5 stars. Prime rib was good and rare. Omlette station great. Steak and sausage great. Pasta station great. No sugar added chocolate pie and cake is superb."}
{"text":"Went with the family about an hour before they closed for dinner. I wasn't that impressed-it seemed like it was the place to eat your sorrows away with mediocre food after you lost a decent amount of money at the casino. Because of the odd time, we were placed at a small corner of the eating area, and rarely had anyone come and take away our plates. It was definitely A-Ok."}
{"text":"I give 3 stars cause the service is excellent all the servers are wonderful and courteous, the food on the other hand is blah don't get me wrong there's tons to choose from but the food is not good, has no flavor I got the brisket was inedible tasted really weird like plastic, maybe to much liquid smoke, and the beef ribs tasted the Same just weird tasting, and the dirty rice was that yucky,, I then tried the breakfast u cAnt go wrong with that, but the sausage had a distasteful  flavor also and kind of soggy in the middle, the Asian food was ok the egg rolls were actually really good... I'm at hmmm with this place I want to really like it but to me the food just tasted weird and lacking flavor big time,,,"}
{"text":"Garbage! They got rid of the Friday crab legs and kept the expensive price. The steak is terrible and shrimp is cold and not peeled... No grilled shrimp anywhere! Do yourself a favor and buy your own bag of frozen/peeled shrimp and cook it however you'd like... You'd be happier you did than coming to this expensive slop house...Do not come here!"}
{"text":"Slightly better than average.

Pros:
Even though the line can get long, they always manage to keep it movin'.
Reasonable price.
It's in The Orleans(which is the casino I go to the most after The Palms).
Decent variety.

Cons:
A lot of the food is pretty bland so every time I go here I end up getting the same things over and over again...
The ~Mongolian section is random and weird(how about having an Indian, Caribbean or Mediterranean section instead?)
Not enough Cajun/Creole/Soul Food, disappointing for a place which is always tooting it's \"VIVA NEW ORLEANS\" horn.

This is probably the buffet I've been to the most out of all the Vegas buffet, and it does it's job. It definitely hits the spot, but it's sorely lacking in many areas unfortunately."}
{"text":"Very, very disappointed.  We frequented this buffet before the BIG CHANGE. The food was always good. Lunch or dinner.
We went for lunch a few days ago. The food has changed drastically.
The potatoes in the potato salad were CRUNCHY. Couldn't eat it. The greens were SUPER SALTY. Couldn't eat it. The black-eyed peas were CRUNCHY. Couldn't eat it.  No hush puppies or cornbread. NO CATFISH!!!  They offered planks of pollock that looked AND tasted like they came out of a box of a GENERIC brand of frozen fish!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely not worth it anymore. Thought the prime rib night would at least worth the trip but it was dry and all food for that matter was not that good. If you want to spend 35 I'd recommend going to south point."}
{"text":"I want to give this buffet more stars but my honesty won't allow me. The price and quality of food go hand and hand in this establishment. This is a place I would eat with my friends when hungover and dehydration has set in. This a wonderful casino with great service but the quality of food is fair at best. I've been here 2-3 times and have always walked away full. I stick to all of the food that looks and smells hot and fresh. Seafood here may be a gamble but I enjoy gambling at the Orleans. I have never gotten sick because I take my time to eat food that looks of good quality. The dessert bar was forgettable. The breakfast buffet is well worth the price. All in all, I would have to say the breakfast buffet is Key."}
{"text":"Went there an while back, had 2-1, The food was good, the service was great. Beats what is on the strip, and for half of the price. Been going back for at least an year at least 2 an month, never had nothing bad there."}
{"text":"Yuck!  I would never visit this place again for dinner!  Food quality is poor, selection is okay, but the food is not that great.  The food was not hot - the desserts looked much better than they tasted.  We went as a family with 4 kids and 2 adults $103 for dinner...  We arrived at 3:05 PM, we were told it was too late for lunch, and were told they closed from 3-4PM (for dinner transition).  They would not let us in even though we did not care about dinner...  We ended up waiting it out at the bowling alley (non smoking area) and then came down at 4 PM and waited in line for 25 minutes!

When we finally got to eat we were very disappointed.  This place is much worse than our local casino back home at Tulalip!

Kids are FULL PRICE!  Food selection is well below average for a casino in Vegas, food quality was below average for Vegas...  I will not be back!  Very disappointed - I went there based on all of these reviews, sad I can't share the same positive feedback.

This place is only one step above old country buffet...  Save your money - eat elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"The buffet at Aliante Casino has a nice variety of food
and the price is reasonable if you have a coupon or discount.
In general the quality and taste of the food is adequate;
the most notable exceptions being the tough green beans and
the dressing which was mushy and lacked flavor.

The biggest problem is that the property is not well managed.

When we arrived at the buffet there were two long lines
extending into the casino, and there was no way to tell
the difference between the lines.  The buffet manager should
put out signs to mark the VIP line and the general line.
After a while somebody started herding the customers out of
the casino into an area closer to the wall.  This should have
been done before the line got so long.  It would also help if
the buffet manager would put ropes along the wall to make it
obvious where the line forms.

After standing in line for an hour the cashier would not
accept our players card because it was the \"old\" style.
We had to get out of line and go to the  Players Club Counter
to get a different card.  The casino should have notified
patrons that their cards would have to be exchanged.

The dessert bar is understaffed.  The gelato service area
alone requires one full time person.  There was only one
person to handle gelato, pies, cobbler, pastries, toppings,
and everything else.  Because of this the lines were long
and the service was slow.
They stopped putting out desserts about an hour before closing.
At 30 minutes before closing there were no more cookies and only
a few slices of pie left.  When we left there were still people
entering the buffet, who obviously were paying for desserts that
they would never get.

The salad bar had items placed in random spots.  It was impossible
to follow the logical progression of getting salad, then toppings,
then dressings.  The person in charge at this buffet does not have
experience running a food service operation."}
{"text":"The Orleans buffet it just average if you ask me. Of course its above any other buffets you have anyways else (thats not on the Vegas Strip). But to me its like your hometown/JJ North/ Chinese Buffet that offers maybe better seafood of course.

Well, I've come here for breakfast and dinner and let me tell you that right now, I give them a 3. Of course I am comparing it to the Mandalay Bay, Bellagio and Wynn buffet. When you have those, you cannot compare these buffets. Of course, you pay for what you get and comparing a 14 dollar buffet to a near 40 dollar buffet, you will get quality and choices. Service is alright, food could be a little better of course. Crab legs, reminiscent of those you can find at Todai's.

But yes, if you looking to not paying too much, or if your looking to not wait in long lines, or if you are looking to get away from the strip, then come on down to the French Market Buffet at The Orleans."}
{"text":"Wow, what a treat. Yes not on the strip, but there lies the charm. After a dismal buffet at a pretentious  strip hotel, this buffet renewed my faith that there are still inexpensive finds in Vegas.
I had the Sunday brunch buffet. It was a couple of bucks more than their normal breakfast, but the selections were phenomenal. Flat iron steaks cooked perfectly, pork onion gravy for the chicken fried steaks, gumbo, jumbalaya, ribs and more ribs. Crawfish! Every dish I tried felt the gave it special attention. Their gelato dessert area rivals the Rio. And for sunday brunch, there's a chocolate fountain and sparkling wine.
Kudos Orleans! 4 stars to food, bumped to 5 for cost and service"}
{"text":"I'm extremely easy to please so this is my first 1-star review and let me just tell you it's for a reason. There was not a single item here that had flavor or wasn't dried out. Lowest quality food I've ever put in my mouth and I feel disgusting right now."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this buffet since the hotel opened. It is a decent buffet given the price. The selection is very limited compared to other buffets on the strip but it is enough to fill your appetite. The service is always great here."}
{"text":"After the renovation, it looks modern. Perfect customer service & great selection of food. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This buffet is awesome! They have a wide variety of items including sushi, BBQ, Mexican, Italian, Asian, salad bar, dessert (even sugar free options), and much much more! 

Your tastebuds will not be bored! I loved how the buffet items changed from breakfast to lunch to dinner and even the next day there were items they didn't offer the prior day. Also during the champagne brunch they have a chocolate fountain! 

They offer an all day pass Monday-Thursday for $25 and Friday-Sunday for $28...such an incredible deal! It's a great way to save money on food while in Vegas. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I usually give this place a 5 star. But this visit at \"seafood night\" was sooooo disappointing The crab looked generic/plasticy and it was wayyyy too salty! :( it's usually never this salty but tonight it was on some other level! I had to take my blood pressure pill after this! This was dangerous!"}
{"text":"This is a big step up from the old place. Lots of choices with good flavor. I would go back again"}
{"text":"This buffet is sooooo foul! The mimosas for the Sunday brunch had almost NO ALCOHOL! I had to drink 5 to get somewhat of a buzz.. All the food is lukewarm, no seasoning and they let it sit out all day! I could practically taste the FOOD POISONING! 

The only thing that was good was the ice cream and thats because they didnt make it themselves. (Blue Ribbon Brand) The flies were relentless! Bugs buzzing around the food! So vile! So disappointing! Never going back!"}
{"text":"Buffet isn't my thing but my girl was having a craving.. So we searched around and saw that the Orleans has what is said to be a good buffet. Good is subjective and lets just say there were lots of people that seemed to be enjoying themselves there.. I just wasn't one of them.. 

Options.. Seafood.. American.. Mexican.. Pasta (Italian I guess) Chinese, and big ol desert bar. Well It was all very plain Jane and wasnt something I would partake in again.

Buffet food is generally low end but this was really just the bare basics of buffet food. Lots of starches and low quality proteins. I guess that's how they make money but it was all very average and pretty sucky. The Chinese food was really bad.. nothing Chinese about it.. unless u figure Panda Express is from the mainland.. but PE blows this away in spades.. American.. was just crappy dried up prime rib.. with lows of bread and fillers.. Salad bar didnt even have seafood.. like shrimp etc..

I wouldn't recommend.. was just too low quality.. price was low.. like the quality.. $28 for two of us.. lol.. should have known.."}
{"text":"After reading past reviews I was just expecting an average buffet. I decided to go anyway since I was coming to Aliante for a movie. I came for the Sunday brunch & with your players card it only comes out to $11. Everything was outstanding! Not your typical bland buffet food. Everything tastes fresh & full of flavor. Top it off with all you can drink mimosas!! Our waitress Rikki always made sure our drinks were filled & plates cleared away. She always had a smile. Bottom line, great food & outstanding service!"}
{"text":"Hate to give a bad review, but if you like the Orleans buffet, please un-friend me. THIS WAS GROSS!

Seriously, this is crap. Hopefully Mr. Boyd does not show up at my house and takes this as constructive criticisms!

We had a comp, I still wanted a refund! the people in front of us paid $44 for 2 on Sunday Night \"Summer Sizzling Southern Crab & Shrimp Boil\". Which comes with a free beer. I asked the server about the free beer, he asked if he should go get it for us? What? I asked what kind, he replied \"Blue Bell Beer\" ... ummmm, again, what?   No, I guess we will pass, since we did not want to inconvenience the server.

Now, let us break this down - \"Summer Sizzling Southern Crab & Shrimp Boil\" - they got one part right, it was still summer. Sizzling? Nothing sizzling in here, maybe luke warm. Southern? Well, they did have crawfish, but they tasted funky. Crab & Shrimp Boil - yes, very bad crab legs ... shrimp boil? They had some popcorn shrimp that were kinda fried ... no boiled shrimp at all. Oh, and the meat?  They claimed it was tri-tip. Chewy and had a weird after taste

I have been in Las Vegas for over 20 years - and this was easily the worst buffet experience to date."}
{"text":"This is a typical casino buffet, a bit of a crap-shoot. Most of the food is pretty good, not spectacular. It's probably as good as you can make at home, but we do enjoy the variety.

In the past, we thought the desserts were particularly good here, but they weren't this time, which was very disappointing. 

However, IT IS A GOOD VALUE and you get plenty of food choices. I would not discourage you from going here, just don't expect fine dining. It's a good dinner though. (or lunch)"}
{"text":"What a disappointment! This will be our 4th time here. Usually my husband and I are very pleased but after today's visit we won't be back! It started in line, on Sundays it's $13.99 or $12.99 with your players card. Usually I carry my card since I have a purse. Never has it been an issue where they only give one of us the discount but today the sassy grouch at the counter wanted my husbands card too. Oh well it's just $1. So we are seated at a table with no place settings and a bowl with one coffee creamer. I was waiting for a family to return to their table as if it was in use. the waitress comes and gets us silverware. She takes our order. Me: coffee and a water, him: champagne and an orange juice. She rolled her effin eyes at him! Really Zoraya? Is his order  really going to ruin your day with your busy section of 4 tables? She didn't even refill our drinks. We are good tippers since we both are in the service industry but this lazy horrible waitress got $0.00! like I said before usually the service is great, even on champagne brunch day. Today it looked like everyone was on the same cycle."}
{"text":"Been to eat at better buffets in Vegas. Steaks were tough, pecan pie looked green (see photo). I did like the Mexican section. Food seemed to sit out all day. Will not be back, sorry"}
{"text":"This review is for the Friday night seafood buffet.  $31.99 for subpar food.  Before the renovation, the price was cheaper and the food was so much better.  King crab was also on the seafood buffet, but not anymore.

The crab legs were so skinny like the Chinese food buffet and the meat did not come out in 1-piece.  No matter what you did, the meat kept breaking apart and stuck in the shell.  The oysters had quite a bit of shell in the meat.  Luckily the crawfish was huge and the dungenous crab was pretty good.  

Prime rib was non existent but roast beef was on the menu.  When the prime rib did come out, it looked very dry and unappealing.  Everything else was just \"average.\"

If you are charging $31.99 premium price for a seafood buffet dinner, the food better be up to par with the price that is charged.

Unfortunately, you are paying for their renovations with a lower quality food product than when it was the French Market Buffet.

Sadly I uses to love this buffet, but now I will never frequent this place as the quality has gone downhill.  The breakfast buffet is just as bad.  Please make the necessary changes if you want to charge strip buffet prices."}
{"text":"(Late post)

This review is really about the quality of the food and not about the staff or service.

I took my family here for the Mother's Day special (crab legs and prime rib) that they were having.  We live nearby and had not been to the buffet yet so we were really excited to try it for Mother's Day.

I have to say that I was very disappointed in what they had available for an occasion such as the one we attending.  With that said, besides the crab legs and prime rib, I'm sure what they were serving is pretty typical to what they serve everyday unless otherwise specified.  That's normally what most buffet restaurants do.  

Nevertheless, the quality of the items are what I was dissatisfied and disappointed in.  It all looked cheap and tasted that way as well.  What's worse, were the crab legs!  Most, if not all of the crabs legs looked like scraps - crab legs with no actual meat inside of them.  

Sounds strange right?  That's what I thought.  I've never been to a buffet restaurant where each one of my family members would grab a plate of crab legs just to return to our table with what appeared to be 80% of empty crab legs.

The disappointment comes in because the property is so nice.  But maybe that's my fault.  I have high expectations for the Aliante Resort Casino.  I mean, I didn't expect it to be Bachanal at Caesers or Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo but I did pay $25/person and so I wasn't expecting Jerry's Nugget either, lol.

Either way, I will try it again simply because it is by my house.  But honestly, that's really the only reason I'm going to give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for my first time as I haven't been here before I seen a couple of the reviews of this buffet and they were okay at best so I was skeptical came here at around almost 630 place was packed as there were people from a wrestling tournament from around the world staying here it was so packed that the lines were going almost out side. Anyhow me and my friend got in because me and him use the coupon we had where you get a free meal at the buffet so was lucky to not spend much of anything here. Now onto the food although it was good they didn't have many options to choose from with the foods at each station it was limited at best but the food was good just wish they kept up with the freshness of the food I went to get my plate the first time got some chicken bit into it as I sat down and it was dry and not that fresh but the second time I got some it was fresh and chewable just wish they were consisted with stuff like that also got the pizza it was good and hush puppies they were delicious and I got some mac and cheese out of the rest of the stuff I mentioned that was the worst no flavor bland and even if you added salt or pepper to it it still tasted awful. Besides that are server who got us our drinks worked her was very friendly and always at are table to make sure we were okay and got our refills we also gave him a tip as he worked hard and went that extra mile for us. Overall this buffet is okay would I say this buffet is one of the best out here no not a chance but you do get your money's worth besides the limited options of food and dessert and you'll leave here full I probably might come back one day as it's not really that bad and the customer service is good I give this place 3 stars."}

{"text":"Took a December trip to Las Vegas for some family and friends fun time ! We visited the buffet at the Orleans hotel for dinner for the first time since it was remodeled. Standing outside the entrance - the remodeled buffet looks very nice and classy - quite a change from the old French Market Buffet. The name has also changed to the Medley Buffet. The buffet now has several cooking stations with much improved food ! The buffet was just OK before - now it's definitely gone up a notch ! Everything we had was very tasty and their selection was significantly improved ! I would now recommend the newly remodeled Medley Buffet at the Orleans !"}
{"text":"Hands down better food than the Bellagio or the cosmopolitan. I would take the bus here from my resort, and then walk back to try and burn off some of the calories. it was so good I went twice.

Directions from the Las Vegas Strip at Tropicana. cross the street to the north side of of Tropicana. there you will find a bus stop. Take any bus going East, but there is usually only just one. get off one the Orleans is anounced.

Mike starting to get a Players Club card as this will give you one to two dollars off.

Directions to French Market is very well marked.

Once you pay and are stated the choices are unlimited. come prepared with what food styles you are looking for. the good stuff like the sea food and barbecue, it's at the far left. this is also where things get very exciting and tantalizing.

At least four different types of ribs in addition to a large carving station, with some of the largest portions of smoked brisket you can imagine. perfectly seasoned, with many rings of smoke, and a fatty bark if you request that. I always request fatty bark pieces. my serving was at least a half pound.

it's a good point to remember that it in a buffet like this, to take advantage of things that you don't normally get to eat so skip the salad bar and go for the expensive things like shrimp and grilled vegetables.

Shock and awe on the dessert station. the tiramisu was so good I went back for thirds.  but in addition there were several varieties of gelato as well as sugar free desserts.

Service was five-star five-diamond. but my diet Pepsi and my water never went empty and I did not have to ask. licked clean plates were whisked away unobtrusively when you would come back to the buffet. From the cashiers to the cleaning crew, everyone greeted you with a sincere smile and kind words.

What really stood out was the number of regulars and locals, that have a choice of hundreds of buffets. What keeps them coming back is the delicious food and service. and I do not have to reply on cheap gimmicks like the Cosmopolitan....stop putting food in different containers such as miniature skillets. this is nothing more than a gimmick to get you to eat less.

I would recommend French market to anyone visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Don't trust the photos. The food is worst a school cafeteria food. I rather to pay a little bit more for better quality food."}
{"text":"So we promised the kids we'd  have a  buffet on this past trip to Vegas.  Just didn't want to break the bank to do it.  French Market Buffet was perfect for this situation.  Can't beat the $15.99 per person price for Champagne Sunday Brunch.  We were so happy that we could have peel and eat shrimp, crab legs and crawfish at this price.  The quality of the food is good, not great.  Definitely not the same quality that you'd find at a five star on the strip hotel, but if you are looking for good variety at a reasonable price, this is the place.  There was a carving station, great BBQ options, Mexican selections, Chinese Food , salad bar and standard breakfast fare.  The best part by far was the desserts.  Got our money's worth there alone....there was a huge selection of french pasteries, gelato, cakes, cobblers and other goodies.  If I was looking for top quality food/impressive selections, not sure this is the buffet I'd choose, but especially if you have kids, this is a wonderful option."}
{"text":"Buffet quality is getting worse each time. Seems like food is not prepared properly or is old. Three in party got sick after eating here."}
{"text":"The renovation looks good but the food is awful. If you're looking for bad food and bad service in a good looking buffet, this place will work for you. 

I went to the renovated buffet the week they opened. While the food was disappointing, there were a few items that were edible and I thought it showed promise. I went back today and I could barely find anything worth eating.  Anything that cost more than a few pennies to slop up was removed since their grand opening. 

They raised prices but lowered their food quality with the reopening.

In just a week food quality has fallen dramatically. If they keep this up they will just be serving ten versions of potatoes and twenty variations of cabbage  and some rice with nothing else soon. Instead of crispy fried chicken they had frozen pre-fried chicken wings which were cold, soggy and disgusting. Instead of a rich oxtail stew they had dried out \"roasted\" sweet potatoes. The clams and mussels were replaced with shells that were pretty much devoid of anything else. Their BBQ ribs were so over cooked and dry they were worse than jerky.  

Service was terrible as well. Waitress was very nice but she could not keep up with all her tables and our dishes were piled high and sitting there throughout the meal. 

It's such bad management to invest so much money and effort into creating a gorgeous new buffet only to ruin it by basically serving reheated the cheapest frozen foods out of some deep discount food warehouse.  I was really looking forward to this new buffet and utterly disappointed.  My review may be a bit harsh and overly critical but Ii really want management to fix this buffet.  There is so much potential to have a destination worthy buffet at the Orleans. 

I hope management rethinks their strategy and decides they should do better ... it's hard to do worse."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast buffet because of being hungry cereal was my choice, not worth the breakfast buffet don't waste you money beside the dessert don't waste your time and money ..!"}
{"text":"We ate here when it was owned by Stations and I thought the buffet sucked. Since the new ownership I think the food is much better. $10.99 for dinner is a good deal especially if you have a 2 for 1. The BF likes Tuesday nights as they have Hawaiian roast pork."}
{"text":"Waited an hour in line to be told that my color players card was no longer used. So then had to wait 30 minutes for a new card and buffet was closed. What a disgraceful customer service. Won't ever come back for gambling or dinner after being treated like this and ruining my Friday night dinner."}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever been happier in my entire life. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's not as convenient to get to.

$17.99 for champagne Sunday Brunch (without player's card) and they did not mess around with the champagne. They basically just poured the entire contents of the bottle into our drink glasses (and it was just two of us). The servers were very attentive and fun. 

The buffet itself: heaven

Made to order omelet station-delicious with plenty of options.

Seafood! Delicious baked clams, sushi, lox for bagels, calamari, and plenty if other options I did not even try (including crawfish which I thought I would try but instead became our table mascot).

Plenty of fresh fruit and cereals including oatmeal and grits. 

The rotisserie chicken melted in my mouth and had I not filled up on everything, else the honey glazed ham looked amazing. 

Dessert selection: wow. So many cookies, pastries, pies, and cakes to choose from, but I had to have the chocolate fountain. 

If I could have stayed for more time (and had a bigger stomach), I think I would have tried everything in the Mexican and Italian sections because everything looked delicious. 

Keep in mind that I have never been to another Buffet in Vegas, so perhaps there are better ones out there, however I know where I am going the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good prices great service! I have been going to the breakfast buffet for years and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Rude cashiers and hosts, some grouchy (rib and meat cutters) and nice (ice cream server) people behind the food counter, nice server, okay food. Don't waste your time or go when you're super hungry."}
{"text":"Very reasonable, especially if you have a players club card. So get one for the buffet. Great place to take the kids, and very well priced. Menu items from pretty much all over the globe. If you are in the area, or staying here, it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Food is ok . I really just ate desserts . Desserts ok . Overall customer service sucks . Cashier very dull. No customer service what so ever . When seated asked to sit near another family but we had to pay 1 dollar more to get seated near each other that's not the problem  at all what's the problem when I asked they brought that up but in a rude way... it's like paying for extra guacamole we charge more! . They sat us like maybe near each other but still refuse to put us next to each other knowing theirs an empty table there.  Jesshhh ok well first time here u could of said something  First and probably last. Customer service f-  had to call someone for refills when asked she asked what I needed in a very rude and like I just shouldn't of asked her anything . Stupid lady ur help obviously refill .. 0 stars"}
{"text":"This place was okay. Ate here on a Friday night. Had the Alaskan King crab legs from their hot station where they serve you hot crab legs with clarified butter. Only problem I had was.....it smelled like fish. I have never had crab smelling like fish.     More like fish water.....if that helps. Crab supposed to smell like crab, not smelling of fish....water. Other than that even if Boyd Gaming now owns this casino, the buffet is basically the same as the buffets at Station Casinos. Meh."}
{"text":"I love it here! I've only been on Fridays for seafood night. The crab legs are amazing and everything else is just as good. I'm always full and satisfied when I leave.  The variety is amazing, I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Customer service isn't the issue, it's the poor quality of food. Compared to other casinos in the area (Cannery, Santa Fe, etc) Aliante is nowhere near theirs. Food seems like it has been sitting under the heat lamps for 3 days. Go spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"this is one of the \"to go\" buffet when I visit LV.  honey love their desert, especially pecan pie.  I love their craf fish and filled my plate with shrimp.  sometimes, their green chile pork stew or shredded beef for taco are really delicious.  I only go there for lunch which ends at 3pm, you can eat till 4pm before they removed everything and shifted it to dinner. with their player's card, it's only $7.99 for lunch.  No boby can beat the price for the variety of food you can get.  yes, when I went Wed lunch, they do have beef ribs, beef brisket, roast chicken at the craving table.  I mean for that price, it's much better than hometown buffet which is the only choice I have at home. not all the food taste great, just need to find what you like.  egg rolls are always fresh and crisp, they do have the mogolian dish, I never have a chance or room for that, eat too much shrimp.... anyway, as long as you set your expectation correctly, you will be happy."}
{"text":"So far I have been here in Vegas for 3 days. I've had several buffets. Including one of the supposed 10 ten buffets in Vegas (Cravings) which totally sucked. The French Market Buffet was awesome. Very flavorful food with the perfect amount of seasoning... Thank u... After 3 days finally good food"}
{"text":"Great new modern remodeling with expanded choices.   Great selections , always open omelet station and  a salad bar. Friendly service"}
{"text":"Pretty good buffet and better than the surrounding local casinos.   Good salad bar and desserts.    Pizza also good.   Can't say anything is excellent but average or above.   One little thing I notice is that they must have a lazy food preparer in the back because their chicken for their fajitas and Chinese dishes is cut in large pieces and not small as usual. Try fitting them in a small corn tortilla and see what happens.   Same with some of the veggies.   That shows they rush things and need to be more attentive.  Service is also good. Like in most buffets they need to stir their foods more often."}
{"text":"I ate here with my family for breakfast. It cost around $9 a person. Pretty cheap for a breakfast buffet. There wasn't that long of a wait. This was my first time here. They had pretty normal/expected breakfast foods like pancakes, waffles, eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, etc. The food was ok. Nothing great that stands out that makes me want to eat here again. We ate here because one of my relatives were staying at The Orleans so we just ate the breakfast buffet here.

The food is ok for the price. If you're in the area and looking for a decent priced breakfast buffet, try this place out."}
{"text":"Been here many, many times.  It's not horrible but not at all worth full price.  The service has gotten better but is barely average.  Food is edible at best, nothing worth remembering.  The Last time we ate there a teenage kid vomited standing right next to my husband all over the floor and chair.  We told our server who didn't seem to care or even attempt to get it cleaned up.  Kind of ruined the whole buffet for both of us."}
{"text":"Great buffet,  newly remodeled,  added more to the menu and better quality food! Big difference from before.. We caught the dinner buffet $18.99 with a player's card.. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"How funny that another group of people had a problem with the manager Rochelle  and the other person we had problem with the cashier Brittany. We are handicapped and most hotels have a handicapped line but we called to make sure and were to go.    So we went to the Medley Buffet at the Aliante Hotel and Casino.  On 2/13/15 we went there, it was about 6:30pm.  We were told that we should go where the handicapped placard. This is where we ran into Brittany and we asked her were are we suppose to go because there were 2 signs that had handicapped and also a black and a purple Aliante card.  Well Brittany said that the handicapped line was the main line and i said do we have to have these other 2 cards and she said yeah but you have to spend alot of money.  We then went to the rewards center and the manager was there, we dont remember his name but he was nothing but helpful. He walked  with the manager back to the Buffet and there was Rochelle.  He spoke to Rochelle and Rochelle talked to Brittany then all of a sudden Brittney Spouts out I never told them that, i then said yes you did and Im not going to argue with you about this.  It is what you said.  So the Rewards manager talked to the Rochelle and we were told that we will be next.  Once the rewards manager left, , Rochelle then opened her mouth and told Brittany to take this person, this person, this other person and then she said take 6 other groups before us.  Brittany then said to Rochelle that she already rang us up, Brittany even had our card and money in her hand.  Rochelle told her to clear it from her register, Brittany then handed me my money and card back.  My other half said that sh will not give our money to Aliante and she said lets go.  So we walked out of the hotel, still have not eaten and went home.  Rochelle was just a rude person and Brittany was no different.  Now Aliante will get NOTHING from us.  Rochelle and Brittany need to know what customer service really is.  If i were there boss, they would no longer be working for the Medley and also Aliante hotel and casino!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I just went to this buffet this last weekend and boy was it worth it! The buffet was around $15 per person for dinner which wasn't too bad compared to all the other buffets esp. on the strip. They served all kinds of food like: italian, mexican, u.s.a., mongolian, chinese, bbq and delicious desserts. I was pleased with the variety of food and service was great. It was so much better than the Bellagio buffet. I totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Super mediocre. This place was maybe 2 steps above Hometown Buffett.  But for 8 dollars, you get what you pay for.  

Me thinks this will only be good for people who are crawfish fanatics.  Something about sucking a crawfishes ass I can't get with.  

Everything was so bland and basic. The only thing I liked was the pizza because it was fresh out the oven.  The shrimp had that old smell to it. The fried rice was bland and dry.

I hear that their breakfast and dinner is delicious. But lunch was not.

They have a gelato bar. I think this is the direction dessert is going in Vegas buffets and i dig it."}
{"text":"The Orleans buffet might not be the most popular in Las Vegas, but in my humble opinion, it's one of the best! It consists a plethora of diverse dining stations. Each station has a wide variety of its particular cuisine. The food is great, the price is right and the staff is very personable. Your meal is discounted, when you use the hotel's B-connected card. They also offer a three meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner) pass at a discounted price. I highly recommend The Orleans Hotel buffet!"}
{"text":"A buffet is a buffet is a buffet (unless you are willing to spend the BIG dollars to dine at the Bellagio buffet...THAT one is amazing.  But I digress...).  We came here with some free buffet tickets in hand (you've GOT to love free Vegas!) and without much of an appetite so we didn't try much.  Overall, the French Market Buffet isn't anything amazing, BUT it does have everything.  There were sections of food \"types\":  American, Mexican, Seafood, Asian, Italian and they each had a really decent selection.  The food was okay, the service was actually pretty good, and the atmosphere was typical buffet.  I think this is definitely a decent choice if you are staying here and want to eat on the cheap or with a lot of choices, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here if I wasn't (especially with the other [better] choices that The Orleans offers)."}
{"text":"Came to The Orleans strictly for the French Market Buffet! To my surprise the remodel was complete and now open as the Medley Buffet. The staff was amazing in accommodating our large party  and Miss Peggy was our waitress and she was awesome! The Buffet itself left a little to be desired but I still got my money's worth. It's going to run you about $12/ per person for  breakfast, $15 per person for lunch, and $20/ per person for dinner . What I remember starting from the left to the right:
Salad  bar with traditional items and pasta salads, soup bar with about 3-4 options, southern type food like black eyed peas and greens, Asian American food, sushi bar , omelette bar with breakfast items, rotisserie chicken, ham, roast beef, then enchiladas and a nacho bar and a taco bar, with traditional Mexican soups. Lastly was the  Italian section with vegetarian lasagna, pasta bar, ceased salad with house made dressing, and three types of pizza . Finally we have reached the  dessert  section that was home to three types of freshly baked cookies , about 10 flavors of gelato , individual mini dessert and cakes . Fountain drinks are included in your price with free refills so don't be afraid to quench your thrust! Plan to spend an hour and a half 2 hours dining at a pace that ensures getting your money's worth. In case you need to drop and reload midsession the restrooms are located right outside of the venue across the casino."}
{"text":"Not worth the cost.  Limited choices and poor food quality.  Will never go back, let aline take a guest."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Great food, friendly staff and great prices. Perfect for that off the strip place. Italian food great, Mexican food (enchiladas) great and the sweets are \"oh so wonderful.\" You might wait a hot minute at holidays but that's ok. Oh also parking is free."}
{"text":"If I had a choice, I'd still eat at the Courtyard Cafe with the lower rating I gave that because I don't like waiting in line, and it was a long wait - but mostly because it was senior day, and all the seniors who were members of B-Connected had their buy one get one free coupons.  I also don't like competing for food at the buffet line.  So, that said, what I'm saying is that the cons are that i don't like that the place was too popular.

And I can understand why it was popular on the day we went.  Of course, the senior couples are eating at half price, which is a great deal because the regular price for lunch is $8.99.  $8.99 itself is a very good price for this buffet.  The variety is good: you have American, Italian, Asian, Mexican, etc. stations, and the quality is good for a buffet (I tend to rate buffet food with a lower expectation that sit-down food).  I enjoyed the shredded pork carnitas, the chile verde pork was okay, and the bbq ribs, I enjoyed also - I can't remember everything I had, now, but I do remember sampling a variety, and I normally don't do that at a buffet.  I normally have two servings and stop.  Here, I think I went back three times, then went for soup (I had a cup/bowl of the hot and sour, and that was a bit disappointing - the broth was too thin).  

The popular item seemed to be the craw-fish. I passed by tables where people had stacks of craw-fish on their plates.  I myself, took a nice quantity of shrimp, and except for peeling the shell, basically had a nice shrimp cocktail (on a plate). 

If the line is super long, like out the door (as it was this day), I'll probably end up at the Courtyard cafe, but if the line is not too bad, and I'm hungry, you'll be finding me in this line."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal fan of this place since 2008.  My brother and mom live in the area and they are regular customers. To me, are more hits than misses.  First off, I love this buffet over many of the others in town because of the prices which can vary from $8 for breakfast to $25 on Prime Rib and Seafood night, with discounts for most meals with a Player's card.  And you can thank gamblers whose lost wages make the price lower than restaurants without losing gamblers.  I love that buffets faster, no one screws up your order, and you don't have to leave a 15% tip.  As regular customers, though, my brother, Mom, and I always leave $4-5 for our servers who all recognize us by now and always treat us well and know our drink selections and bring refills without asking.  That's a special treat during the Saturday and Sunday brunch when the mimosas flow freely.  

The hits include the brunch omelet bar when you can even order egg white versus whole egg...with a wide array of combinations.  I always order everything in it, including melted cheese and jalapenos. Usually, their piles of bacon are crisp and not greasy.  I also love the times they have Prime Rib, not the regular roast beef. which can be dry sometimes. The Prime Rib is great with fried rice or various potato versions.  I enjoy the pulled pork in the Southern section with sweet yam casserole and collards.  In the Mexican area, I like the tacho bar and menudo with a rich broth, and you don't have to eat the tripe if that's ain't your thing. The good soups are clam chowder and cream of mushroom.  

And since most of us don't eat enough veggies, there are some decent choices such baked yams, plain boiled peas and carrots, Chinese stir-fried eggplant and bok choy, Italian style summer squash, and buttered carrots and green bean casserole when available. To me, their tastiest vegetable dish is the baked yam casserole. The roast pig  night on Tuesday is great, and is a favorite with the large FIlipino community here in North Vegas. Thursday night is pasta night...they pile shrimp on their Fettucine Alfredo.  The words \"I'm on a diet\" are prohibited on those nights.

Their salad bar quality varies with the seasons.  Don't expect really sweet melon in the winter.  The salad bar choices are good but somewhat limited.  I would like to see more and variable prepared salads...But  I like their cole slaw, imitation krab, and carrot raisin salads. Eat some jello, too....it's made from beef collagen and good for your joints.

The desserts selection and quality vary, but their pies,  pastries, and cakes are usually decent though not particularly memorable.  My favorite dessert when available is the chopped hazelnut chocolate bar. I also like their ice creams.  

The misses to me include the orange chicken and sweet and sour pork.  Anything deep fried with sauce on it is always gummy.  But that's not just here, but almost anywhere.  Their corn on the cob is rarely sweet. Their Alaska king crab I like but some say it's too salty for me.  I don't like their burger patties that sit out.  If you can't tolerate smoke, that might be an issue because smoking is allowed in this Casino, like all Nevada casinos.  Most people don't smoke in the aisles walking to the buffet, though.  And their air filtration system is state of the art, for what it's worth.  Also, there is no bathroom in the restaurant, so bring your alcohol wipes or wash hands before entering.  
 
The lines can be long during Mother's Day, night time, and weekend brunch.  If you ever have a large party, please talk to them know beforehand and don't go during the busiest time.  We once had 15 people at 11 AM and it was a fantastic time.  And if you have any handicapped person in your party, they try to seat them ASAP.

But really, the best thing to me is the service of the staff.  A few of them come up to my mom who's been a regular customer since 2008 and give her a hug or a warm hello.  The value is overall pretty good.   When unlimited breakfast is $6 with beverage if you have a Player's Card, for the price of a fast food breakfast, it's hard to beat."}
{"text":"The buffet is located at the Orleans hotel.  We came here for Sunday brunch which was about $14 per person.  They charge adult prices for any kid 8 years or older even though they don't eat like adults.  They separate their food by regions, American, Asian, Mexican and Italian.  They also has a separate section for desserts. This was typical buffet food, the ribs were my favorite.  The omelet station is a little different.  The ingredients for your omelet are in a salad bar and you grab what you want and place it in a bowl.  You then give the bowl to the cook who then makes your omelet.  Overall, food was decent for the price you pay."}
{"text":"AWESOME! Affordable, delicious, tons to choose from. Ate here multiple times and always had a good meal. Breakfast is my fave and if you go around 10am, they switch to lunch about 10:30/45 so you can get those choices too!

Don't try taking a piece of fruit with you to go though. They'll stop you! :-P"}
{"text":"Everytime we go to Vegas it's a must love their Breakfast buffet. .Prices are pretty good..."}
{"text":"Good food good prices for the family. Service is really great food is fresh. Don't pass up the ice cream bar."}
{"text":"$15 for an all you can eat buffet that includes PRIME RIB? I AM IN!

The prime rib was my favorite. I really ate about 3 slices. & thats ALOT because i ate the other food as well. The workers were very nice and the reasonable amount of items on the buffet were okay. I was sad they didn't have FRIED CHICKEN but its okay.

I'm not too sure if we'd be coming back here, but it was a nice change and surprise."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to eat at this buffet in the Orleans Hotel and casino. It was moderately priced not much of a long wait and really, really decent.

I went for breakfast, primarily. I enjoyed the really crispy bacon, the scrambled eggs we're perfectly scrambled and fluffy. I also enjoyed the buttermilk pancakes. I've been to buffets in Vegas such as Caesars Palace, the Bellagio, Winn, Harrah's, The Flamingo, Rio, pH, etc. This one was nearly half the cost and was about as good as most. Nothing fancy but good and satisfying.

The service, on the other hand, was very lacking and almost non-existent. I basically got up and got my own coffee and tipped accordingly."}
{"text":"We had a large party of 13, so was a bit challenging getting us in, but we all waited for a few tables.  The selections are good, there is a BBQ section with beef ribs, chicken, bbq beans, corn bread, a New Orleans section with Jambalya, gumbo, collard greens, mud bugs and red beans and rice, a Chinese section of fried rice, noodles, char Sui, a carving board section of roasted chicken, turkey and roast beef, gravy mashed potatoes, an Italian section of pastas and pizzas.  A salad and soup bar and a dessert section with selections for diabetics.  Serve was nice, refilled our sodas, Walter and coffee.  There is just nothing that jumps out at you that says delicious, mediocre buffet food, the crawfish was good, collard greens good, hush puppies good, roasted turkey was dry, gravy ok, couldn't find the bread.  Ice cream or the gelato was very fluffy/airy, not a good texture, soft serve I passed, the cookies were ok.  Again, nothing stands out at this buffet."}
{"text":"There is no buffet that I frequent more than this one, and not just because it's close-by, but because for the price you get a pretty good meal!  It's even better if you're a gambler there because you get a discount, sometimes a comp!  I have been coming here for years, and the food is always consistently good.

They offer the usual American-Asian-Mexican-Italian-salad bar standard that I've come to expect in the average buffet here in Vegas, so you shouldn't feel like you won't find something you'll enjoy.

I eat here once a week or so, and my favorite go-to items are their BBQ items... I love their ribs and their brisket!  I also judge buffets by their mashed potatoes and I believe this buffet has some of the best in town -- none of that powdered potato crap, this stuff is legit, smothered in yummy butter!  They have a mongolian grill if you're the type who likes fresh-grilled asian fare as well.

They have a really great selection for dessert!  Although my favorite is always the gelato, if you're lucky enough for them to have chocolate chip cookies that day, make sure you swoop some up!  

I usually go for lunch or dinner, but the other day I woke up early enough for the breakfast buffet for the first time in a long time, and was pleased to see that they offered many gluten-free items, and their made-to-order omelets were on point!

Great selection and affordably-priced, this is my little gem of a buffet off the strip."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome value for the money. It was cheap to begin with, but they recently lowered prices and you still get a discount with a Coast Card, even if you have no points on your card. A lot of people seem to just go for the crawfish, which were OK, but nothing special since they appear to have just been boiled in water. I'm used to them being boiled in seasoning so I don't really like them plain. However, there is so much more to eat than the crawfish. The salad bar is nothing special, but they had watermelon. I think they are just coming into season since I didn't see them at too many other buffets. There were lines for the watermelon here. I was lucky to grab some just as they were restocking.

My friends reported the BBQ station was very good, but I mostly skipped it since we had Brazilian BBQ the night before and I wasn't really in the mood for more meat. I ended up eating a lot from the Cajun station and the USA station. The Asian station had stuff for Mongolian BBQ, but I didn't see too many people take advantage of it. I should have since I love Mongolian BBQ, but I really couldn't take too much grease that day. The Mexican station had stuff for DIY tacos, but I was too lazy. The pasta station was probably the most disappointing. The pizza was OK, but the other items were either horribly mislabeled or complete failures. It could have been the former since they did have Salisbury steaks in the USA section labeled as terriyaki chicken.

The dessert section is a big surprise. Not only did they have some pretty good cakes and rolls, they also had a good gelato selection. Overall, I really enjoyed this buffet. I honestly could have paid twice as much and still be fairly satisfied. They also have beer and wine specials ($6 bottle of wine) for those who are interested. The only negative was our server seemed kind of upset the whole time, although she did occasionally refill our drinks and take our plates."}
{"text":"By far my favorite buffet in Las Vegas.  The food is outstanding, the selection is great, and the service is also great.  You also cannot beat the prices.  $7 for breakfast if you're a B Connected Players Club member or a guest at the hotel.

Even if I'm not staying at the Orleans during my visit, I will make it a point to get to this off-strip hotel for breakfast, lunch, or dinner at the buffet.  I highly recommend doing the same for others as well.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here many times before but tonight I am soooo disappointed. First after we pay the gentleman  in the tux looks at us and does not say a word to greet or to let us know we need to wait to be seated. We wait then the girl comes to take us to our seats. I wait over 10 minutes in an empty buffet for someone to get my drinks ordered. Usually  my grandma is very simple to satisfy but even for her she tried different things and finished non of it. The food was cold the pork was dry. I don't know what happened but I used to think this place was pretty  decent but not after tonight's Tuesday night hawaiian pork night. My $23 is better spent on 2 meals elsewhere. Thumbs down you guys. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Been going here for 15 Yrs Plus. Best Food, Quality Selection, Great Fresh Flavors, Many Stations to choose from, and very reasonably priced. Forget about the big Casino Over Priced Crap. Great Deal Right Here."}
{"text":"The seafood is what gives it 3 stars, the service wasn't courteous and it was messy everywhere. It's a decent buffet, desert is ok, price is ok, hot chocolate is good, 
I see myself going again, only for the seafood (:"}
{"text":"For the price, this is an excellent buffet.
Been here 4 different times for lunch and each time it's exceeded expectations.
Everything from salads, soups, entree selections, and the deserts were all well prepared, fresh and flavorful.
Looking forward to our next trip to LV, and will be hitting this buffet at least a couple times :)
Oh, and the Hotel rooms and Casino are also excellent!"}
{"text":"Food was just plain, not of a lot of variety either. Not a place I'd be eager to come back too."}
{"text":"***Friday lunch review***
CHEAP!!!!...but expect what you paid for...

We've always wondered and were curious about the casino buffets away from the strip.  On Friday around noon, we had to go to AutoZone and Orleans Casino just happened to be around the corner...we said...why not?

The buffet has no lines which was nice...Yes it is nothing like the buffet you experience on the strip but for the price, it is ok...not bad.

* Price:  $8.99/person...CHEAP

* Food: NO CRABS but small cocktail shrimps with shells still on them.  My most memorable was Mongolian BBQ...it's descent (oh don't ask for beef...it's tough and tasteless) Crawfish available...but dry.  Oh I would stay away from the desserts...

* Service = pretty attentive.

* Ambiance = honestly, it has a feel of run-down old casino buffet but it's ok.  It has it's charm...very relaxed and casual.  

Ok, no sophisticated gourmet here...basically, if you dream of being able to go to a mall food court and eat whatever you want, all you want....this place is it."}
{"text":"I've never seen steak cooked on a gas grill with 1' high flames. They looked like charcoal and surprisingly enough...  tasted like charcoal.

Second round I asked if they had any steaks that weren't being charred and they brought out a pan with several steaks that looked like they had been microwaved. No flavor at all.

The good news is that I like salads, but for some reason the salad bar only had salad and a few toppings. 

Management should be required to eat the food they are serving. I get that its a buffet, but it is possibly the worst buffet I've eaten at and I've been to a hotdog buffet at a bowling alley in Pahrump... 

Cut up my player card and not going back."}
{"text":"Garbage. 

This place used to be awesome before it became Medley buffet. Now the food sucks. 

They used to have seafood on the weekend (Fri and Sat). Then they changed it to just seafood on Fri. Now they have completely got rid of seafood night. WTF?! 

By the way, they also raised the price. For whaaaaat???? Luckily we get comped dinners here. There is no way in hell I would pay for this food.

For anyone thinking of coming here without a comp, please don't waste your hard earned money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I stayed at the hotel, that portion was great. However their buffet is probably one of the worse ones I had while I was in Vegas. The dinner buffet was about 15$ which is cheap for dinner, but the food wasn't all there, the beef was dry, the desserts seemed old and it tasted like it' sbeen sitting out there for a while. The best part was that they had italian meat balls that were tender because they were overcooked in the sauce. I would say avoid this buffet and goto in and out about 4 blocks towards the strip."}
{"text":"Finally tried their Sunday champagne brunch.  Only complaint was that we overate.  Line was about 15 minutes long, service was good, food was fresh and had great selections.  Getting refills on drinks was no issue and the champagne tasted great."}
{"text":"Service was good, that's what the 2 stars are for. 
Came for the seafood and it was not good. Extremely salty crab legs ( the main thing we came for) and the rest of the selection of seafood was blah. Live and learn , I guess."}
{"text":"Yuck. I was in the area and hungry so I decided to stop in for the Sunday brunch buffet, which is $11.99 pp with a players card. It was a little after noon when we got there but the brunch is supposed to be until 3. All the breakfast items were cold, old and hard. I tried the eggs and they were hard and crusty. The French toast was rock hard and the sausage patties were inedible. The best thing I had was a bagel with lox and cream cheese! The dessert section was lame, but they did have gelato and a variety of soft cookies. I tried the spumomi gelato and added little mini marshmallows on top and I almost broke my tooth chewing on one of the marshmallows. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This review is for December 22, 2016. This buffet is located inside the Orleans Casino. If you have a players card, there is a BOGO deal. 

The customer service, particularly the front, I was not satisfied with. The woman who rung me up had an attitude the whole time. I asked her how the BOGO deal worked because my dad did not know, she rolled her eyes at him and ignored him. I had to ask another hostess. 

The variety of choices of the buffet was amazing. They had USA, Asian, Mongolian, Seafood and Barbecue. The chefs were fast paced ensuring each tray was stocked. The quality was great as well. I'm very particular with how I like my barbecue, but none of the meats were too salty or underdone. I appreciated that."}
{"text":"My son and I didn't really know what we wanted to Eat, so he suggested going to the buffet since we has a two for one coupon. They have American, Tex-Mex, Italian, Asian, & BBQ. The Asian food definitely has the best selection and quality. Of course they also have a soup and salad bar with fresh fruit. And they have a great dessert bar with cookies, different cakes and pies, and ice cream. $16.99 or $12.99 with a player's card for dinner!"}
{"text":"Tried the lunch buffet here this past Saturday around 2pm-ish  - pretty decent for the price of $10 per person and they weren't super busy at that time.

Service: 

The service was okay - our waiter was a bit slow and they didn't really clear out our plates as quickly as we ate...actually it would stack up quite a bit before he or anyone came to clear it. He was also hard to wave down to get refill on drinks. It did get a little busier with big parties of people coming in - looked like there was a graduation somewhere cause a lot of graduates came in to eat with their families. 

Food:

They have pretty good selection of cuisines and not to mention an unbelievable amount of choices at the dessert section. They had a lot of comfort food for sure - fried chicken, mac n cheese, jambalaya, etc. What's interesting was that they had really good pizza - usually buffet pizzas are okay - but the pizza here was really cheesy and the crust was really perfect - not super thick and not too thin - so to my surprise I think their pizza was pretty awesome. 

They had a lot of good choices for desserts too - 7 different flavors of Gelato - the peach ice cream was the best and the Watermelon Sorbet was very refreshing. In addition, they also had Tiramisu, red velvet cake, cookies and just too many to name - However I did like their Chocolate Cream Pie the most - it was pretty heavenly. 

Overall this was a pretty decent buffet for a pretty fair price - at least for lunch. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"My family and I came to eat at this place (7 total). They have No Children's Price and No Senior Price. My son is 7yrs. old and my grandmother is 95yrs old. We paid for the price for 7 adults. 

They sat us by connecting 3 tables that are not even and seems that the table was not wiped down clean. Tried asking if we can be move since they have sooooo much open area but they can't. The carpet floor at my end table had a very bad odor. And their high chair need to be clean way better, it was dirty. Instead I held my 1yr old on my lap. Our server was ok."}
{"text":"The food was really good and different than the other buffets. my only complaint was that the crawfish was plain. and for a place that is supposed to resemble new orleans they should have put creole seasoning on it. i didn't like how the server was rushing us to get out of the place since it was mother's day and a line. overall most of the food was very good and the price was great."}
{"text":"When I was in Vegas last year, I came to the Orleans French Market Buffet. When I showed up this year, I was surprised to see a total redesign and re-vamp, now as the Medley Buffet.

First, although the previous buffet was cute and rustic, it was clearly aging. I love the new set-up and decor. Its chic and modern and I like that it feels more \"open\" and fresh.

That said, the food was hit or miss. Some things were pretty good, while others weren't great. The shrimp scampi and the stuffing were mushy, but the cuts of turkey and salad bar were delicious. It seemed to be like that with most of the food, so quality wasn't consistent. 

Our waitress was a bit MIA most of the night. I get that its a buffet so you don't need constant attention, but we didn't see her often and that made it difficult to get refills on drinks or dirty plates taken. Other than that, the service was adequate. 

There's a nice variety on desserts but I don't like the addition of having some of the small desserts behind the glass case and having to ask for them. It made it feel like I was inconveniencing them, or that I shouldn't take as much, even though its a buffet and had they been out in the open I would've gotten one of each. 

Overall, its a decent value buffet. I would come here for a lunch and maybe a dinner again. There are better buffets around, but this wasn't the worst by far."}
{"text":"Love the food selections and quality available. Seating arrangement however is very uncomfortable as tables are pretty close to each other. Customer service with waiters are usually a drag and they hardly care for you. Overall, I would come back but hesitant to recommend to others."}
{"text":"The Medley Buffet was average. We went for Sunday Brunch and it was ok. The food was good except the eggs benedict and shrimp pasta. The shrimp did not taste fresh. The mimosas were extremely weak. I question if there was any champagne. The decor was nice and the wait was short. I would go again but it was not 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good and really good for the price. Compared to other places I've been that cost more or the food sucked I will come back here again the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This buffet was mediorce from the beginning.Wanted to pay seperatly....cashier could not figure out how to do it.We get seated.We go to the buffet.Fake crab meat in the ceveiche.I asked server what the steak was? She said it steak.It was rib eye....looked liked donated beef of anything....maybe beef to be discarded.She would identify the steak.I did not eat eat it.I chose the ny strip and prime rib.Both were just edible.The rest of the dishes were just ok.....edible....not really good.For the money....
not worth it.Inferior food......They need. to improve the quality and up the price"}
{"text":"This is for Sunday brunch .it was ok, I was kinda disappointed but I think my expectations were just too high. They have a pretty decent variety of lunch and breakfast items. Nothing was bad but nothing wowed me either. But you will definitely find something to eat. And it was cheap
 10.99 with the club card. So for the price it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Awful and over priced! We come to Vegas every year and we drive to the Orleans hotel and Casino for their amazing breakfast Buffet.  We arrived to the Buffet to find that it was closed and under construction. There was the other breakfast buffet inside the same hotel. It was 13 dollars per person which was more than we were used to paying at this type of venue but we were there and hungry so we gave it a shot. We were so disappointed. Firstly we were there at 9 am. Not anywhere close to lunch and there we more dinner food items then there were breakfast....crawfish, ribs and salad bar. Don't get me wrong I don't have a problem with that except that there was no yogurt, fruit, grits,ect. The only bread they had was held in an area that you had to wait in line for an employee to make toast. Our 7 year old got pizza which looked and tastes like it sat for two days. We had to pay full price for a 7 year old which made the experience that much worse. 
 The wait staff brings you drinks. Ours was was not friendly and when she asked if We needed refills she didn't even wait for an answer and had already walked away.

Don't waste your money at this place."}
{"text":"After hearing about this buffet by many friends recommending it, I decided to make the trek over to the pretty Aliante Casino to try it out...

Atmosphere:
As previously stated, the Medley Buffet is located inside of the Aliante casino. The seats are pretty comfortable, and the decór is visually pleasing. It's very nice on the eyes. However, there isn't a bathroom inside the actual restaurant. You have to go outside of it to the casino floor over next to the TGI Fridays. Not a big deal, it's just inconvenient when your daughter needs to go. Also, due to where the restaurant is located, the place smells terribly of cigarette smoke and the perfume they spray to combat it. It's to be expected, since it IS a casino, but just be warned that it IS there. 

Price:
The price for this particular buffet is fairly expensive for the quality of food I had received, in my opinion. We paid $12 per person, including the child price and using the Aliante Players Club card. It is more expensive on Fridays and the Weekends too, so please take that into consideration. (We went on a Thursday night) They do give a discount for people with a players club card (which is free!), so I suggest that you get that first for a couple bucks off each person. 

Food:
The food here is decent. They have different stations clearly labeled above them such as Mexican, Italian, Barbecue, Asian, and traditional American food. The desert selection isn't too vast or impressive, but what is there is pretty good. Unfortunately, though, the food isn't much different from other, cheaper buffets such as Golden Corral or Ryan's. 

Overall, I wouldn't necessarily say to go out of your way to go to this buffet, but if you're nearby, can afford it, and your party can't decide what type of restaurant to eat at, then stop on by and fill your bellies up until you can't walk out!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed. I have tried a few buffets in town and I've falling in love with one. But it's very expensive. I heard a few good reviews about this one so we decided to check it out. It was nothing short of amazing. Great customer service. The food was amazing. 10.99 for brunch with a players card. Fresh omelettes made to order. So many items to choose from. I enjoyed everything I picked. I left feeling so full. I will definitely be back and I will ring family here too."}
{"text":"Orleans has stepped up their buffet since the previous one! The food was delicious and fresh! Each time I would get up to get more food, the seafood dishes would restock like the crawfish, oysters, and mussels. The waiter was polite and very attentive towards each table with their needs. The only thing disappointing from this seafood dinner was the crab. Usually the crab would be snow crab legs however today was dungeons crab legs which doesn't have too much meat in them."}
{"text":"You can't beat this for $15.  It is worth the short drive off the strip.  Food is decent.  Staff is nice.  Great if you have a big group to feed and don't want to drop $20+ a head."}
{"text":"This buffet is ok. I used to like it a lot more when they had steak night on Saturdays. Once Aliante was bought out by Boyd they seemed to make small changes and now Saturday night is prime rib/shrimp night. Lines here are hit or miss. It's usually totally dead during weekday breakfast and lunch, but can get packed at night especially when they have their specialty nights: Tuesday pig roast, Wok Wednesdays, and pasta Thursdays.

My favorite things here are usually the BBQ meats - pulled pork, baby back ribs. The pig roast on Tuesdays is good but the meat goes quick, so you need to grab it as soon as they put out a fresh pig. Wednesday night is basically Mongolian BBQ/stir fry. They get super backed up though so it may be a good 15 min before you receive your cooked creation.

I live in the area so we drop by a few times a year. If you don't live up north, I wouldn't recommend the trek up just to eat here. It's really not that great!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this buffet for over a decade just for the BBQ station and the  ribs! They have a fair selection of foods to keep you happy and its all very tasty. 

Dont tell anyone ......but i heard they added a new chocolate fountain.....*wink wink*"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Orleans and this buffet for many years. It has always been my favorite buffet and game me an excuse to spend the day in the casino, aside of the many times that I have stayed at the Orleans. However, I went to the Orleans on 7/4/17 to go to the buffet followed by the casino visit. The regular buffet area was closed and they had a mock buffet on the other side of that part of the casino. The line wasn't long, but we had to wait for 45 minutes to be seated. The food was about 1/4 of the amount of choices that the other buffet had, and it was of poor quality. The employees were commenting on how bad this was. We got it over with and I lost interest in the casino. I emailed the Orleans and received a response from Rhonda, the buffet manager. Basically I was told that that's just the way it is. They charged the regular price and did not notify their gambling customers that there was a change. Rhonda said that she hopes that I will come back to that buffet sometime, though wasn't acknowledging that there was a problem with their setup. I'm done there and maybe someone else will avoid wasting their money sometime."}
{"text":"Went for the seafood buffet...was so excited to have the crab legs but they were dissappointing. Im not sure if it was not cooked well or just bad crab but it was more work than it was worth.   Crab meat was sticking to the tendens so when you then cracked the shell the meat wouldnt come out. Tried the prime rib and it was so bad and overcooked hid it under a plate and sent it to the garbage. Tried eggrolls they were terrible... the only thing good was the clam chowder which was actually amazing."}
{"text":"After the NBA Summer League was over, me and a couple friends wanted to find a buffet that was decent & good priced despite being in VEGAS. I believe this hit the mark exactly. At $22, i thought this was a reasonably priced Buffet in the Orleans Hotel & Casino.

The food was A-OK in my opinion is slightly better than the average home town buffet in your local town. I got my fill and did not feel gross after lol. this Buffet worked out and 3 out of 5 is exactly the kind of food your getting. Nothing that makes you say this is good but will fill you properly."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Vegas. Huge selection and huge seating area the line to get in is never long only on Friday and then it's only 10 to 15 minutes. The Friday seafood buffet is amazing i go almost every Friday, if you have never been you're missing out."}
{"text":"Terrible, bland food and even worse service if you can even call it that. First of all, the buffet was half empty and yet we had to wait 10-15 min in line to even pay and then another 10 min to be seated. Once we got in, we got no service at all once our initial drinks came. It seemed like the waiter had some type of issue with us even though we said nothing to him besides what we wanted to drink. Something was clearly wrong though because he never came back to our table, despite walking by a hundred times during our meal. He walked with his head up but whenever he got close to our table, he would look in the other direction as if to ignore us and continue serving the other tables around us. Is it a crime to be Asian now? WTF. This was very offensive and that's not even considering that we never got refills, napkins or service whatsoever.

The food isn't much better. Everything that I tried was either overcooked or bland except for the fried chicken wings and ice cream which ended up being most of what I ate. Healthy right? The entire Asian section was terrible and I was forced to waste an entire plate of food. How do you over cook broccoli beef or forget to season chow mein so that it tastes like nothing? I just don't get it. Worst buffet experience I've had in Vegas and I've been to some seedy and dirty looking buffets...Will not be back and would not recommend"}
{"text":"Fairly good place to eat. Service on drink refills was a bit slow that's why I gave it 4 stars.  Food was good and fresh.  Good selection of food.   A good place to eat if you have kids or a large group of people.  Everyone gets what they want and no waiting."}
{"text":"I went here for Seafood night on 6/30/17. I waited about an hour in line (not the restaurant's fault; it's an extremely popular night!) and was then seated after paying. The waitress (Cherie) promptly welcomed us and took our drink orders, and was clearly working hard in her packed section to keep drinks filled and clear the plates, most of which were filled with crab legs! She was a great server, and appeared much more friendly than some of the others there. As for the food, what an incredible selection of seafood, and other food. Crab legs, cold crab, mussels, clams, baked fish, fried fish, sushi, and more, as well as all the other usual international stations. The price is very reasonable IMO at $26.99/ $24.99 with players card, considering that you can eat all you want, and drinks are included. Definitely a fantastic choice when you feel like a splurge!"}
{"text":"Average is the best way to describe this buffet. It's reasonably priced. The service was fine. Of course there was a wide range of choices. The healthy options were actually pretty good. As were the desserts. The biggest disappointment was what they called brisket in the BBQ station. Basically it was awfully similar to eating at Golden Corral."}
{"text":"A mirror image of Red Rock's buffet...which is a good thing..lotsa people here during a military appreciation  night...the food is plentiful and fresh..it's Wok Wednesday  if ya wanna stand in the line, I'm sure you'll eat well. I put together a yummy thanksgiving plate.."}
{"text":"Disappointed - not my idea of a Vegas buffet. Poor service and microwave quality food - I guess as the saying goes - you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"The food and prices makes up for the long wait time getting in. I definitely recommend this place to everyone. I have been to many buffets in Vegas and this is by far the cheapest. So if you want a Cheap quality Buffet, and don't want to pay the high price of one, this is the spot you're looking for."}
{"text":"The food is mostly dry. I had one tamale and it was horrible I was only able to eat the meat. Some of their food is doughy as though it's not cooked all the way. Their pies are very dry. The ribs were not eatable, they were so dried out I couldn't even chew it. The best part is the ice cream swirl. I wished this place was better. Circus Circus has one of the best buffets. Also our waiter Tony, no personality. I don't like when someone is talking to you without looking at you instead they look over your head. What happened to friendly staff that smile?"}
{"text":"Medley Buffet is the name of the Orleans new buffet. It replaces the French Market Buffet which had been the casino's buffet since they first opened some 20 years ago. It's theme matched the casino. I actually liked the French Market Buffet and had been going for years. It had a very casual atmosphere and it was decorative, the Mexican food section had a Mexican theme decor, the Chinese food section had a Chinese theme decor, and so on. It had character. I liked the layout. One big section in the middle for desserts. Matching fruits, salad, and soup sections on each side of the buffet. And a row of everything else stretching across the entire length of the buffet starting. Most of the food wasn't the greatest but their BBQ section had to be one my favorites.

This new buffet is a lot brighter and a lot \"fancier\" looking than before. The layout is just one long row stretched across the length of the buffet. They have the usual Asian, Italian, BBQ, and Mexican sections with various items changed and even improved. The dessert section is a lot smaller but offered some better items. The soups, salads, and fruits section is ok. There's grilled steak. There's these thick short ribs which was my favorite item. I ate a bunch of them. The BBQ section seemed smaller but they still had the BBQ beef ribs which was good. They have crepes, pho, el pastor tacos, and those Mexican corn on the cob.

Overall it's not bad of a buffet though I've had better in the price range. It was about $20 for regular dinner, non-seafood night."}
{"text":"Food here is average. Ate here many times. This review is a classic \"I was mistreated\" type of review. 

I showed up 3 min late. My fault no doubt. Along with about 10 others who were turned away. Considering just two days ago I got in line 10 min late I was surprised that they were enforcing the clock so strictly. But \"rules are rules.\"

What I can't handle, though, is being lied to. I was watching hundreds of people in line for a buffet, and they told me that they \"didn't have someone who can take my money.\" (lie) Then I'm told there are \"no open tables,\" when I could see many open tables. (lie #2) Our group is then told that there is a \"power issue\" (possible lie). I asked, \"so what about all those people in line to eat, are you going to make them all leave?\" She says \"yes.\" I was floored and said I would like to see that... So she then starts going table to table, but nobody actually leaves.

I know this because at this point I was standing away from the front door looking at my phone deciding where to go for food when hotel security surrounds me ...

Now ... I know that I was late and I know that they weren't going to let me in. I lost, I moved on. I never yelled, I never made threats or swore. I had what I thought was nothing more than a conversation with a restaurant manager. The fact that she resorted to calling security shows that she is out of her depths in a position of leadership. I cannot imagine what she would have done if I truly was a risk. 

I can handle being rejected. But if you are going to obviously lie to me then I have a problem with you insulting my intelligence. Just say, \"sir, we don't want to let you in \" and be done with it. Telling me you \"can't\" and then making up of a bunch of made up nonsense is really insulting.

And a manager should learn how to be firm without having to call security. That was downright offensive and embarrassing."}
{"text":"Wow so much better than before. Newly renovated with more food options. Best buffet I went to while here in vegas. Couches to sit on while you wait for your table. Take out a players card and you will get $2 off- it is free to get a card btw. Lots of delicious options. Leave room for dessert for some gelato. Those little baskets they put food in are cute. so good and the price is amazing. Will be visiting more often while in Vegas."}
{"text":"went there for dinner because I like to try different buffet.
food is really not good. just OK. barely edible. food really deserve 2 stars but they made it up with the ice cream selection.
I really like the peanut butter flavor and other flavor. I forgot what.
this buffet price is really cheap so just come in to eat a few items and the ice cream will be worth it."}
{"text":"I wondered why my dad took me here several years ago. Its because its cheap and almost a good competition to Rio's World Buffet. I think the price is $8 per person for lunch. I did not have a Orleans Club Card, but $8 is a deal. The Sahara Hotel has $8.99 Buffet with a Card, but with the Orleans, you probably would save $1 or $2. I remember my total was around $16. Very Good Deal!!

They had Salad, Mexican or Tex-Mex Station, Chinese Station, American, Italian, and their own big Dessert Station. I mainly went to American Station since I always fall in love with Mac N Cheese. I had sandwiches, and bunch of other Americana stuff. They had a lot of food, but I only had three plates. Like my headline says...I am a Big Guy, but I don't eat a lot.

Orleans is away from the strip, but somewhat is small scaled version of the Rio. Orleans has their French Market Buffet and Rio has their World Buffet. If you are on a budget and not wait a long line...go to the Orleans. Its pretty cheap for lunch without a Club Card and food is better than the Sahara Buffet and probably as close to the Rio Buffet without the high price. 

Lunch Ends around 3:30pm. Not sure what time Dinner starts during the weekdays. Very reasonable and not too crowded, but the food is very good and not seem too be mass-produced.

Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!"}
{"text":"This buffet is always good  food is always fresh and hot even between change overs,  but the waitresses and waiters here are lazy sacks of shit at a buffet pretty much all you have to do is bus your tables an refill drinks and they can't do that i am a a huge tipper this is the only place i never tip"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice.  Once for lunch 2 years ago, and once for dinner 2 weeks ago.  I have to say that I really like this buffet.  There's nothing fancy or gourmet about it, but maybe that's what keeps the \"down-home\" menu consistently good.  Small selection at the salad bar, but the romaine lettuce mix was fresh and they had beets.  My favorite section is the BBQ.  The pork spareribs were baked to a delicious tenderness.  Sauce is served on the side.  Mac n cheese was  bright orange, creamy, and cheesy.  LOVED IT!  Other sides were simple but good.  The sign at the register said $13.99 for dinner but they were charging $16.99 that night (because it was Christmas week?).  We used our $1 off Gold card, so it was a good meal deal."}
{"text":"Buffet located inside Aliente casino. I have been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I especially like breakfast here. Great selection of food. I also really like getting down on soups, salad and fresh fruit. The pozole is one of my favorite dishes here. It tastes home made. Very tasty not skimpy on the meat. Big chunks of tender meat.  

Some of the meats can sometimes be on the dry side but it is a buffet. It's still a great value. This is a large restaurant with lots of seating. Both tables and booths. There is plenty of people working here keeping the place clean, neat, and the food stocked. The service here is good. We always get waited on promptly. Drinks served timely and plates cleared from our table. 

Next time you're hungry and can't decide what to have come here and you just may find something you love."}
{"text":"Excellent place for the quality/price/variety of food. The brunch buffet line moved quickly as well. I love the scoop ice cream the old fashion way. I like the option to have mimosas or champagne. The ambiance and decor excellent"}
{"text":"Food was very bland and poorly put together. Everything tasted old and not fresh. Weird smells from food lines. Omelette bar was gross. The only reason they are getting 2 stars  is because of the breakfast desert."}
{"text":"Buffett was pretty good. They have seafood. . Mexican. .usa...bbq.. Italian... salads .desserts of many kind like cakes. . Pies. Gelato.. pRices listed online are only if u have a player's card which is free if u don't have one the it's about $6 more"}
{"text":"Don't be scared away by the huge line of large people: it moves fast.   Strange concept where you pay at the register and then get in line to be seated for your buffet.  Drinks are free and fast (soda and water that is).  Several buffet stations: the variety is key since each section does not have a huge range of appetizing items, maybe 1-2 things in each section looked reasonably attractive.  No particular dish was special or amazing, just basic level ingredients and expected tastes.  More comfort food/americanized versions of foreign cuisine (this is Vegas after all).  Good way to fill up before a long night or afternoon out wandering the sad streets."}
{"text":"This buffet is located in the Orleans hotel, which is not on the main strip.  My family introduced me to this place because it was a favorite of my grandmother's when she went to Vegas.  There's a free shuttle that takes off from Bill's Gamblin' Hall and brings you to Orleans.  It runs every 15 min from 9am to midnight.  

The food is good!  I recommend going straight for the crawfish and beef ribs.  They are the \"signature\" items!  The crawfish is boiled in a cajun style broth has great flavor without being too spicy.  The beef is super tender and well seasoned.  The good thing is that because these are very popular items, they're constantly being replenished.  Aside from these two items, everything else was okay.  I sampled the gumbo, mushroom stir fry, and a few of their desserts.  All were good, but I spent most of my time eating crawfish!

At $7.99 for lunch and $13.99 for dinner, this place is one of the best buffet values I've seen.  I will definitely be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"I was in vegas for Viva and we stayed at the Orleans.
I went to this buffet on Easter for brunch 
I must say the food was delish the fruit was fresh and the pastries were divine
for a buffet it was good"}
{"text":"I was SO pleasantly surprised by the Medley Buffet tonight! Having been in Vegas for a decade, I have become accustomed to mediocre buffets at local casinos, so I was hesitant to try Medley tonight, but gave it a try hoping for yummy seafood (Friday night is Seafood Night). I was not disappointed! The buffet boasted abundant crab legs, a decent sushi selection, and a variety of other foods. My two year old, who usually eats like a bird, asked for second and third helpings (which I was delighted by since I had to pay the child's price for her - the first time I've had to do so at a buffet!). The atmosphere was just the right amount of noisy that no one batted an eyelash when my daughter would get excited about a crab leg or wave her chow mien like a lasso.  I would have liked if they provided traditional she'll crackers for the crab. Also, when I asked if champagne was available to accompany the meal I was told no. I would have loved to enjoy some bubbly alongside my crab. Lastly, I recommend the hot crab over the chilled. I found it to have much more flavor and easier to eat. I will definitely be back for seafood night!"}
{"text":"Great Value Buffet at a low price, Lunch time Buffet is just $12 per person although I recommend getting a players card and then swipe in the Machine as you can get a buy 1 get 1 free, but even so at just $12 for lunch the choice is amazing, there is American, BBQ, Pasta, Mongolian, Fish, Gluten Free choice, vegan and Vegetarian  Huge Salad and Desert section,Which includes Sugar Free and Diabetic choice as well! something for every taste!  there is also soup available, the restaurant is clean, the service with a smile, even though the Que to get in was long we was in and sat down within 5 minutes and it was worth it, the food choice is great, its hot and fresh! I we got served By Antonio and kept our pepsi glasses filled, for Brits like me remember they work for tips so a tip of $1-$2 per person is a great way of saying thank you."}
{"text":"This buffet was recently downgraded, prices too, and it is now a far cry from what it used to be.   We could hardly find anything edible at lunch time.  The baked ham was tender but tasteless, and the shredded bbq turkey was okay.  Other than that, most things were inedible.  The \"gelato bar\" has the foulest tasting stuff you could ever imagine, I think that it might be made with water instead of milk, or maybe with powdered milk.  It tasted like slush, not gelato.  
A better dessert would have been strawberry shortcake since they had a can of \"real\" whipped cream on the counter, but they brought out a big vat of frozen strawberries that were still frozen!  Not just cold, but frozen in a big block that you'd have to take a pick and shovel to if you wanted strawberries!  
Even the salad bar was skimpy and lacking....usually I can make a good meal of just salad, but not here.  
Garlic bread was very  good if you got it when they first brought it out hot, and lunch was only $7.99 per person,  therefore one star.  If you can survive on garlic bread, ham and shredded turkey, by all means it's a steal."}
{"text":"Located at the Orleans Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas... 15 minutes til closing time and the food was STILL the bomb!!! My friend didn't agree, but I don't care... I'm sure there's better buffet's in Vegas. But they're AREN'T better buffet's in Illinois... So with that, I'm giving these guys 4 stars... The food was fresh even though they were closing... The food tasted great even though they didn't have a great selection... The Chinese was better than anything you get at home. The Italian pasta??? Same thing... A selection of ribs from different regions. And all were good... Round that out with all you can eat Prime Rib??? And I'm happy... The only downside was??? Where was the Cajun fair????? They had crawfish. And my buddy told me they had Gumbo... But I expected Louisiana southern cuisine. And it wasn't there... Oh, did I mention the fried chicken???"}
{"text":"As of today, it is the Medley Buffet. A real big step in the wrong direction, IMHO. Whoever was in charge of this remodel was very foolish! Gone is the festive, colorful feel of the old buffet. Welcome to the dreary somber feel of corporate gloom. There are grey walls all over the seating area that separate you from the food and other diners. There is literally nothing to look at. I'll miss the whimsical signs directing you to the various types of food they serve. Still no restroom in the buffet.

I was there for lunch today and found that even though they raised the entry price, I didn't see any roast beef, turkey, shrimp or craw fish like at the old buffet. Perhaps I missed them because the food area is more spread out and there are no signs.

They also eliminated any dedicated line for disabled people which shows me that they don't realize that they have a much older customer base than most casinos. Maybe they just don't care. Remember, I said whoever is in charge was foolish and inconsiderate of customer needs!

Whoever made up the new pricing is also foolish as they post on the website and at door that breakfast is from 8am to 10am and lunch is from 11am to 3 pm. What happens between 10am and 11am? I called and asked and was told that if you come after 10am you will be charged the lunch price ($3 more) BUT you won't get any lunch items until 11am when they start putting it out! Who made this ripoff deal up? Maybe they were rushed to come up with this new ridiculous pricing. They only had 4 long months before they reopened. READ UPDATE BELOW...

To sum up, a cold dreary atmosphere, raised prices but fewer pricey foods, no accommodations  for handicapped people, unnecessary walls all around, still no restrooms in the buffet, and unreasonable high pricing etc., a definite step in the wrong direction for me. I much preferred it the way it used to be!

UPDATE: I went back today to the new buffet to take another look and found that I was given incorrect information yesterday. The reason for lack of pricing between 10am and 11am is that they actually close and stop admitting customers for that hour! They do the same thing from 3pm to 4pm. I'm retired and don't keep track of time anymore. I go to the Orleans to gamble and as soon as I either run out of money or get hungry, I head for the buffet. Now I have to worry if it'll be open since they close twice for two hours a day during the daytime. I guess I'll have to find somewhere else to gamble and eat."}
{"text":"Medley Buffet is located at Aliante Resort and Casino in North Las Vegas

I came I came on Saturday night for Brazilian night and the price was $17.99 for dinner; with a player's card. I've been to my share of buffets through the years in Vegas and I'm a fan of those with a variety.
Medley Buffet has just that a variety of different foods; a medley of them.

They have a various different stations from Asian to Tex Mex to Italian. They have typical buffet items such as fried chicken, pizza and pasta but they also have some unique items such as tamales, chicken siumai and tamales. That night since it was Brazilian night, the place also had plenty of beef items such as steak and pulled pork. Lastly they've got a dessert section that includes a full ice cream bar with featuring ice cream of different flavors such as pecan praline, pistachio, cookies and cream and spumoni and a medley of toppings such as cookie crumbles and sprinkles.

They give a full steak which is nice; but I did notice my \"medium well\" was more like overcooked. Overall though I did enjoy several things from dinner here. Some of the items I did enjoy that night included their cauliflower soup, rice pilaf and beef tamales, fried plantains and sesame balls. I also was a fan of their desserts. I enjoyed my pecan praline ice cream topped with cookie crumbles. Despite the 47 degree weather that night, I was not going to pass up on ice cream. 

As you can see, I tried a medley of things ;) at Medley Buffet and found this place not to be bad choice when in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"While working I was talking to a bus driver who I will call \"JOE\"( because THATS HIS NAME!!) & we were talking \"Buffets\" & he said I had to try this one. So to show what truly nice people I have encountered thus far in Las Vegas, Joe not only makes a recommendation to this place, BUT gives me a $4 off coupon & meets me on Tropicana Ave to give it to me and drives me there with his wife & daughter as they were on their way to run errands. HOW COOL IS THAT?? (Answer: VERY!!)

 So I ended up paying $5 and change for this AWESOME Buffet using the coupon. And let me tell you now THIS PLACE IS HUGE!! The entire dining area has to be as big as a basketball court if not bigger. And for the size and the crowd on hand, it was a very nice and orderly atmosphere, well lit and pleasantly quiet with no crying babies and no standing up \"Peekers\" looking over the back of the booth I was sitting in. (I like to feed them string beans!!)

I asked to be seated in a booth and was gladly told to sit wherever I wanted. There are several stations = BBQ, American, Mongolian, Chinese, Mexican, Italian and a HUGE island of deserts.

I made a good attempt to try as many items from as many stations as I could and ended up liking the Chinese station the best that had spring noodles mixed wt vegetables & Beef  that was really fresh and good.

Joe had really pushed the BBQ Beef ribs saying they were the best but the selection the day I went had ALOT of fat on them and I had to pick at them to take it off. And while I'm complaining I might add that the onion rings, fried fish & chicken fried steak had ALOT of breading on them that had me picking at it as well. Other than that though I really cant complain and have to give this place 2 thumbs up.

The Mexican station was extremely good with beef tacos and all the toppings and a spicy shredded chicken that made nice tacos as well. There were other selections such as enchaladas etc and it all looked very good.

The Italian station had speghetti, lasagna, pizza that all looked really good too. I have a sliver of a slice and it was very good and crispy and I tried a couple pcs of eggplant parmesean and it was off the hook good .

There was also peel n eat shrimp wt tartar & cocktail sauce as well as crawfish which looked good and I had one and still cannot see what the draw to these things are as its alot of work for very little pay-off in the way of meat. I chose to stick wt the shrimp & mixed them in wt my Chinese noodles mix & sliced open a couple spring rolls and put them inside. I always \"shrimp out\" my spring rolls!!

The aforementioned Desert Island had a little of everything = soft serve ice cream, strawberry & whipped cream toppings, scooped Ice Cream, Gellato, Pies, Cakes, Cheesecake, & cobblers. I tried the Coconut Cream Pie and the filling was off the hook (I had 2 pcs and had to stop myself from getting more!!) but the crust was soft and mushy-like and not to my liking at all and I didnt eat it. I also tried some soft serve Vanilla Ice cream  wt whipped cream and the taste of the shortening in the whipped cream came through and more cream & sugar was needed.

The waitstaff seemed nice enough but my Ice Water was'nt refilled, nor was I asked if I needed a refill. I didn,t so it wasnt really a big deal. The girl taking the plates off the table seemed to be working the hardest and I felt bad for her and took my plates up myself several times. I also hid a dollar under my dish within a dish so she would find it and not the waiter as she deserved it more than the waiters did.

Overall I have to recommend this buffet not only for the wide variety and selection, but the quality and good food offered. I only paid $5, but had I paid full price it would have still been worth it."}
{"text":"For the amount of money you pay you think they wouldn't brine the crab making it so salty. Is this a trick to keep patrons from eating so much? 

The salmon was paper thin and unrecognizable as salmon. I was very disappionted by this. 

The oysters looked like they had been sitting out long enough to form an outer crust. 

The garlic clams were good and there was still meat and pizza for those that were dragged along by a seafood eater."}
{"text":"Not my favorite but it's a nice convenient buffet next to my home. Servers are usually friendly unless they're really busy, easy to get overlooked when they only have a single server to a full section. Food itself is decent, though if you're a fan of sushi, steer clear of what they serve here, as for most all you can eat buffet-style sushi when it's not the main food served there. It's always a little stale.

One thing I like most about this buffet, though, is the dessert area. The sugar-free zone is where I hang, and it's actually not terrible! 

Pricewise, the buffet is inexpensive if you have a small party and you have a players card for Aliante casino. Otherwise, it gets pricey.

No comment about the kitchen area since i try not to look past the foods on display. Dining environment is fair. I have nothing horrible to say, but also nothing outstanding to comment on. An average buffet."}
{"text":"Brunch gives you all the breakfast staples:

Corned beef hash = reminds me of dog food, but maybe that's just corned beef hash
Eggs Benedict 
Waffles/pancakes/French toast = really dry
Omelets = dry and the \"extras\" didn't taste fresh 
Bacon/sausage
Scrambled eggs = Really runny, I could actually slurp it up
Chicken fried steak = super dry, gravy mediocre 
Sweet potato pancake = the one thing that is actually ok, best thing in the buffet
Hash browns = ok, can't screw those up!
Syrup = super thin and runny"}
{"text":"Let's be honest here. This is not Caesars Palace but that doesn't mean that it's not a good buffet for the venue you're eating it at.

To start with, understand that this is actually owned by a corporation that owns several different casinos here in town most of them called Coast. For example Gold Coast, Suncoast.

Which means you're going to get simular quality at all of these buffets but the Orleans is actually slightly above the cut of the others.

I'm only going to be talking about the seafood night, because if you pay a few dollars more it's the only night that it makes sense to go.

So, Friday nights are Seafood night. Typically in Las Vegas this is the night that most of the hotels put out Seafood.

It makes sense doesn't it? People get paid on Fridays, Seafood is consumed when people get paid and have extra money, unlike the strip hotels which can jack their prices up and put the food out every day of the week this is how the local hotels and casinos operate for seafood.

Okay, so what are you getting here?

Well, in addition to the regular fare, you're also getting snow crap period The Orleans snow crab is pretty decent. It's not skinny and small and actually quite large compared to other hotels here in town.

It comes served cold but you can also take it over to the Mongolian cooking station and have it heated up for you with different spices which is something that no one else offers.

Word of warning though, if you're like me and you can't eat seafood then you should probably avoid the Mongolian station all together. They literally cross contaminate like crazy which is the only reason I can't give the early and so true 5 star review.

Everything else at the buffet is actually quite good. The food is fresh and turned over on a regular basis.

The dessert bar is actually great they have gelato and lots of different desserts for anybody's tastes. Make room for dessert when you go to this one.

I can only assume that the rest of the week is just like Friday nights but just without Seafood with the exception of shrimp. I highly recommend the Orleans versus the other local hotels here in Las Vegas because the quality is pretty darn good the wait times are low and the service is great."}
{"text":"Great selection! Go for Sunday brunch and they will have one lox and bagels which is one of my favorite things to eat. They also have a great omlet station. I love that they have fruits and vegetables which are as fresh as it can be. I love there Asian section, they make great food there. They normally make lemon chicken, sesame chicken and a chicken dish. They have a great selection in the mexican food part as well as an italian part. If your at the hotel i'd recommend it. You cannot beat the food you will get at that price. 

Go hungry because they do have a great amount of food that they serve. The meat is great whenever they have it out. 

Dessert is awesome! They have everything there."}
{"text":"Disgusting food! Nice new remodeling though . Not worth eating here for the price . $14.99 for brunch per adult . Flies were on the cookies and desserts section . Stale bread. Just gross!"}
{"text":"Go for lunch, if want crawfish and beef ribs you'll enjoy this buffet. Desserts were hit and miss, not worth the money for dinner. 

Staff were very friendly but the food was a huge disappointment and this meal was my intro to the Orleans hotel dining...will stick with my old time fav the Spice Market in PH."}
{"text":"Mold on the pie, told the chef he told me it was just burn marks. Never seen burn marks that are green. As we where leaving he was yelling at the dessert lady , and pulling all the pie I was eating. Only thing good about this place was the drinks. Even the prime rib was over cooked and dry . Gross, the shrimp scampi people on here rave about is slimy."}
{"text":"I loved the price for the buffet, they have Italian, Mexican, American. Chinese, BBQ, Mongolian, seafood and dessert with gelato and a few others I missed. The place is a little run down, torn booths and sunk in. Took a while to get my drink, but the waitress was extremely attentive afterwards she explained she had a large party upstairs.

The Mexican food was meh, the taco shells weren't crunchy and it fell apart as I was about to take a bite. Ribs were excellent from the BBQ stand and Mac n cheese was yummy. Seafood was good except I hated the fact that I had to peel my shrimp. 

Dessert station was good, I recommend the gelato and cream puffs. 

I give four stars because of cleanliness, the dessert station was a mess and I seen a lot of different foods mixed with others. 

I encountered a group of tourists with strong body odor (not the hotels fault) but it made me lose my appetite."}
{"text":"Pros: good price for a buffet (even better if you have a rewards card), nice selection of foods, delicious desserts 

Cons: most of the food was subpar due possibly to being reused too many times and/or over cooked, sushi was horrible (cold hard rice)

We were a bit disappointed with our visit. We had heard that Medley was better than the old buffet and we finally had the chance to try it. Honestly if you're not absolutely starving then go somewhere else. We've decided that unless someone is willing to pay for us then we most likely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Went for the breakfast buffet. We went with 3 people, clearly told the lady 3 people, apparently we got charged for 2 and the staff was getting angry at us for only having been charged for 2. Finally told the lady to charge us for the other person and gave her the money. Could have been handled better. Picked an eggs Benedict.... tasted like windex, made one of the ladies sick, not food poisoning but thinking about it. Sausage was overdone almost burnt. Cake tasted stale. Not good at all. Very dissappointed."}
{"text":"As a carnivore who doesn't eat any starches, the meat selection at a buffet is the most important part to me. I was very excited to see that they offer a \"Brazilian Steak\" night, and upon walking through the buffet and looking at the choices, immediately rated it 5 stars. But then I tasted the food...

It was all so dry that it was hard to eat. I'm not sure if it was left over then reheated, but it was so dry or just overcooked, but it literally wicked the saliva out of my mouth. So much potential to be an amazing buffet, but executed so poorly."}
{"text":"First off...I'm just going to say this buffet have a pretty great dessert section for a \"off the strip\" property. So definitely save room for dessert. They got endless flavors of gelato, different kinds of cakes and pastries (some are sugar free as well).

Second...they have a good variety of food items available with a small salad bar, Mexican, Italian, Chinese, and a BBQ station. I'm a simple kind of girl when it comes to buffets. I really don't care for the seafood and all that \"fancy smancy\" stuff. Just give me the basics of  spaghetti and meatballs, eggrolls, enchiladas, dumplings, BBQ meats and sausages etc etc...you get the idea. For $8.99 per person on a weekday lunch...you can't beat that."}
{"text":"Hands down, best Thanksgiving buffet outside the Las Vegas Strip. Our server, Morgan, gave us extraordinary table service!

We got in line around 12pm and, inspite of how busy the Medley was, we were led to our table around 12:30 :-)

The kitchen staff was on spot! There wasn't any cold dish anywhere, unless of course, it was meant to be cold. The meat dishes were tender and juicy. The veggies were crisp. The salad, fruit and dessert bars were equally good.

I thanked one of the supervising managers, after noting that two of them helped clear and set up tables to keep the incoming guests seated. That's teamwork!

It's no wonder that the Medley is my fave buffet. Highly recommended.

Now get in line before they run out of ham, Turkey, and steak! Not! LOL!"}
{"text":"Don't often write bad reviews but, unfortunately it happens.  Buffet has been remodeled, prices went up on average $5.00 but quality suffers. Let's start with the dessert station, most items were fairly bland, the custard tasted like more flour than egg, the ice cream/sorbet/gelato did not have the basic chocolate or coffee flavors not to mention the mint chip i did have was not very good.  The main entrees were over cooked, the fried items were too crunchy/hard (onion rings), fried chicken. The one redeeming item was the chicken gumbo soup.
I won't be giving this place another try for a while needless to say."}
{"text":"This is the second time coming to this buffet and the food was pretty okay; however, I asked about the time this buffet was supposed to close.  The buffet was closed at 0900pm and it was a little bit after that time so I wanted to get some dessert before I left.  I went over to the dessert place and the worker was hollerin' out..\"we're closed!!\" Then, he proceeds to turn out the light so I walked away very disappointed.  After spending $159...really?  Not sure if it was worth it to come back."}
{"text":"I give this buffet five stars because the price with the member card is affordable, other than the $10/child 2+, and the food is great! This is our usual brunch place to go to when we're in town visiting and it has never failed us, plus the unlimited mimosas aren't too bad either!"}
{"text":"I went to French Market Buffet at the Orleans on a Saturday for brunch. It was $15/person and totally NOT worth it. I should have gone to TGIF, which is also located in the Orleans.

The food was sub-par. The only two items that were tasty were the ribs and the gelato (+ for this), both of which you had to ask a server for. There are different food stations, but their themed dishes were not worthy. Customer service was great, but there was still nothing memorable about this location. 

Please save your $$$ and try another buffet."}
{"text":"I honestly gave it 2 stars because it's $21. So if your short on cash and want edible food this is your place. The warmest food we had was the tacos they made fresh and those were room temperature. Pork ribs were bloody and when I brought it to the cooks attention he told me that was smoke, yep cause now smoke runs out of meat, sure!!! The prime rib was cold and tough and this was the \"new\" piece of meat he was cutting. Manapua was bomb!!! Best thing about the buffet."}
{"text":"We went to the buffet tonite and I have to say it was outstanding! Everything we ate had great flavor and didn't taste bland or overcooked like a lot of food at most buffets. The casino must have changed staff at the buffet because it was excellent! The deserts were great and flavorful also! Finally a buffet that's actually close to us that worth going to!!"}
{"text":"Major disappointment.  Lunch in December 2017 was $12.95 without a players club card and the food was completely forgettable - I can't recall a single item, and they only utilized half of the serving stations (not a lot of choice).  I did not get my money's worth.  Now, back in the early 2000's this was a very good \"value buffet\" which feaured decent food at modest prices. No more.  I still like the Orleans, and their rooms are clean, spacious, and well appointed.  But this newly renovated buffet was a huge disappointment and an insult to what once was the French Market Buffet,"}
{"text":"Worth every cent! Crawfish and Prime rib at it's best!"}
{"text":"it's a buffet.  good variety of usa, bbq, chinese, seafood, mexican, italian represented."}
{"text":"Beautiful renovation BUT food still the same ..

I love how trendy this buffet looks and the presentation of the foods but it's still NOT good.  

They did change some of the food items like the omelette station and the meat craving station and the desserts(only thing that was good).  

Chinese was probably the worst, than Italian and the soup station.  I was hoping it would be better than before but not."}
{"text":"The food was disgusting and the service is one the worst. We went during lunch time and it was like 7.99 but man, even with the cheap price comes with cheap ass food. The only good thing was the french fries and the soda -.-"}
{"text":"So I admit I'm not a regular to come to Vegas but for the past 4 years I've done my best to come to a hotrod car show hosted by \"Viva Las Vegas Rockabilly Weekend\" and luckily this year was one of them. Medley Buffet is located in The Orleans Hotel and Casino, which by far is my favorite. I love the Southern feel it has and the buffet hours are from 8 to 8. We went on a Saturday so the price was 20 in change, we were a group of 8 and they got us a table quick and our waitress was friendly which is always a plus considering the amount of people there. Well, considering i was wearing a tight 50's dress i admit i did not eat as much as i normally would but I attacked the egg flower soup, roast beef, salads and shrimp for sure!! In fact, I enjoyed the food so much i didn't take pictures of it. ( except for a video i saved in snapchat lol )"}
{"text":"This is a great buffet with a clean, very nice atmosphere. The drink servers are very attentive and friendly. All food items labeled accurately. A little pricey, yet I would go here again."}
{"text":"I liked the decors, kinda classy with high ceilings and bright chandeliers. So 3 stars for that.. BUT the cashier was very very rude, impatient and not helpful at all. We were confused as to how many discounts we can get since 2 of my friends were members in the hotel. She was looked like she was getting short with us and ask us to step aside while we figure our things out. It was really rude and to think she was the first person customers will interact with even before paying for the buffet. We were seriously considering eating elsewhere but we had already made it through a very long line to be seated.

The servers were really pleasant. Thank God! 

The food, however, was an entirely different story. Seafood tasted bland, no seasoning whatsoever. The tools to crack the shells were unreliable and often break. Some of the dishes were already cold. 

I'd come back though, just to give it another shot and see how their Steak Menu is like. If it bombs, then I will not come back here again."}
{"text":"Two words. Powdered potatoes. 

The mashed potatoes are powdered. I know this because I nearly choked to death on a powder cluster that wasn't thoroughly mixed in your mashed potatoes of lies. 

I also resent being resented by the carving station people for busting up their conversation because I wanted a sliver of parched turkey. 

Everyone working there just seems despondent."}
{"text":"It was our first time trying Aliante's buffet and we loved it. It tasted a lot fresher then some of the station casinos we've been to, and the quality of the food was mm mm good. My partner and I loved the Asian section! The pork buns and noodles were so yummy! 
Certainly check out this place if you're looking for a station like casino buffet but one with good flavour! Just know the section is a little smaller then say Santa Fe or Red Rock."}
{"text":"If i could give zero stars i would. Waited for an hour to even get to the pay line. Horrible wait for the not so great food."}
{"text":"Friday night seafood buffet is always good! My family and I always go....well, we used to. Last night was probably our last. The buffet manager on duty, Rochelle was RUDE and I did not appreciate the way she spoke to me! I know losing a family as customers won't do any harm, but HER customer service was flat out horrible! 

There were two lines, no signs indicating what or who the lines were for, so we stood in the shorter line. Well after 30 minutes we find out its for the VIP people and get asked to stand in the other line, which is now ridiculously long. Told her it wasn't fair, there's no signs what so ever, she said that's why she was monitoring the lines. So I said, well you weren't monitoring it for the last 30, minutes, and having to stand in another line wasn't fair for us! Then she told me that talking to her like that was the \"wrong move\". Talking to her like what? Factual? I walked away cuz at that point she pissed me off with that statement. Went back to her asking for a manager or someone else I could speak with to find out my options, cuz I still don't feel this is fair. She said she was the buffet manager. So I told her that as a manager she shouldn't be talking to her customers like that. She went on to tell me she doesn't have to take abuse, and her company was behind her 100% and that she didn't need to serve me and could get me escorted off the property. I agreed with her, and let her know I too work in customer service, but this isn't abuse. Never once did I raise my voice, swear or anything. Yes, I spoke with an attitude, but I feed off of vibes. As a customer, if you are going to treat me that way, don't expect me to talk to you politely. She kept telling me to calm down, and I told her repeatedly that I was calm and all I want to know are what my options if there were any. She gave me a whole uneccessary speech about telling me again she doesn't have to take abuse, that she was trying to help me but I kept attacking her and if I stepped out of line one more time she would call security on me. Even if it was me asking a question, to her i was \"coming at her\". I didn't want to talk to her to start with, but she refused to get me someone else and i feel she just used her manager power trip on me. 

She finally agreed that we didn't need to stand at the very end. Had she just listened and wasnt so quick to jump into defense mode, this could have been resolved so much faster and much more pleasant.

And the only reason why I stayed, because I didn't want to, not after all that, was because my son wanted to eat crab! If it wasn't so late in the evening, I definitely would have made the drive to somewhere else!
 
Everyone else we came in contact with was very pleasant as always!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for brunch on the weekends.Only 11 dollars with a players card.Everything is always fresh and there is even an omelet station.Also,all you can drink champaign.Its a good deal"}
{"text":"This is the cheapest place in Vegas to eat buffet...but you can see why. 14.99 gets you a bunch of crap food and unlimited champagne. I'd honestly rather pay 20 bucks more and try the Rio buffet instead, which is a whole better deal.  I'd get little foods here and there and take a bite out of everything but i wasn't impressed.  In fact, all I ended up doing was eating a bunch of bananas."}
{"text":"We went here for the Prime Rib and Crab Legs. They have this special every Saturday night for $21.99 per person. Which I thought was a pretty good deal! 

The buffet was full of people but the line wasn't long at all - how awesome!! The casino is like 25 min away from the strip so that's why it's not crazy busy but it was definitely worth the drive. 

Everything I tried was hot and fresh. I was especially fond of the Pork Bun Baos in the Chinese section. They were so warm and yummy. They had a BYO burger and hot dog station I didn't get to try because I was so stuffed but it was the first time I've seen this at a buffet and it was quite popular with the other guests and looked good to me! 

They served the Crab Legs in baskets, and there was a small line for them. But it went very quickly. One basket per customer at a time and they were VERY serious about this. A woman ahead of me asked for two so she could bring one to her husband and one of the chefs walked with her with the second plate of Crab to her table! But I understand why they are serious about this and it's still AYCE so I didn't mind that I couldn't choose my own pieces or anything like that. They also don't offer any Crab crackers because they slit the shells for you so you just have to crack on the lines. How nice! 

The prime rib was kind of dry and over cooked :( 

The dessert section was kind of small, but I found some decent things to eat. They also have scooped ice cream with a variety of flavors along with the regular ice cream machines. 

The inside of the buffet is nice and everything is displayed well, they kept all the food warm and the surroundings clean. I will definitely return, maybe even on a weekday since it's only $11.99 then."}
{"text":"The new buffet at The Orleans Hotel and Casino was disappointing.  The food wasn't good at all.  The cornbread was dry and tasteless.  The prime rib was fatty and cold.  It is definitely not worth the price.  The service from Robert was excellent.  The poor quality of the food and drink was not his doing.  I remember when this buffet was one of the best around.  Admittedly it was a long time ago, but when you continue to raise the price of a buffet you should not lower the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I came on Easter Sunday, which was the last day of Viva Las Vegas for the Champagne Seafood Brunch, and I was pretty pleased. The line to get in was pretty intense, but it went by fast so didn't wait longer than 20 minutes to get seated. The French Market has all sorts of food including: American, Italian, Mongolian, BBQ, Mexican, Chinese, and Seafood. They have 2 big salad bars and a pretty good dessert section, but seriously, who wastes time with salad at a buffet?! 

The beef ribs and prime rib from the carvers station were pretty good, probably one of my favorite things there on that day. I mostly took my chances with the huge variety of seafood there was to offer. The salmon, the king crab, snow crab, shrimp, craw fish, mussels and clams were all very good. The craw fish is sort of complicated to eat and so are the crab legs, which there was a crazy long line to get, haha. Fine, maybe I'm just dumb and don't know how to eat, but still I was getting impatient with the craw fish and crab legs. It's too much work for not that much meat, haha. 

They had an omelet station where you had omelets made for you after picking out what you want in it. It was whatever, not too impressed, takes too long and isn't the best omelet ever. The whole USA section of the buffet is pretty bland, very typical breakfast foods, but boring and flavorless. and I love breakfast foods, but that was a fail. The deserts looked so awesome, but I just had a little bit of ice cream, didn't want to go into food coma after.

Too bad I was driving home after otherwise I would've taken advantage of the unlimited Champagne and made them fill up my Viva boot for me, haha. I really wanted to eat their usual Sunday night dinner which is rib night, but since it was Easter they had the Seafood Brunch special, oh well maybe next year."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need to get out of the office with the gang and have some fun! This is a fine...and close....place for it! This is our \"Field Trip Friday\" lunch spot. We load ourselves into a couple cars, drive over and for $8.99 we bond over a mediocre A-Y-C-E Buffet. No harm in that!

OK, the food kinda mediocre, but there is a LOT of it!
And the deserts are my favorite! Next time maybe I will just eat sugary treats?"}
{"text":"Decent, clean and fair qaulity! Large variety of options.

Not like most buffets were they place more sides then main staple items."}
{"text":"My husband and I tagged along to my mom's high school reunion.  They invited us to have dinner at The French Market in The Orleans.  The buffet here is ok.  I had a hard time getting something that I liked.  The only thing that I remembered were crab legs and the soup.  Other then that...everything else was bleh..."}
{"text":"Ok buffet. Need a different variety of foods. Same as lunch & dinner.
Children have to pay full price as adults!!! Even a 2 yr. old will be charged adult price, so beware!!"}
{"text":"Cheap! 

Would not pay a dime more on this food. It's your run of the mill buffet food with poor cuts of meat."}
{"text":"This is not one of the best places for a buffet, but if you want to save money and go to one for the basics, this is it.  They don't offer fried shrimp, crab legs, etc., but they do have prime rib and roasted chicken. Yay."}
{"text":"The buffet is great for breakfast only, lunch and dinner needs some major improvements the food is horrible I couldn't believe it brought my family of 6 the 3 of them are boys and not 1 of them got for a 2nd plate REALLY DISAPPOINTING"}
{"text":"Decided to go to this buffet after many years. When I was a kid, this buffet was the best, but it has gone downhill. When I came for Seafood Night on Saturday, there wasn't lots of people in the buffet. The food quality didn't look so good and the taste of the food was horrible. Not recommended."}
{"text":"This establishment does not even deserve 1 star. What a bad experience me and 14 of my family members experienced today. We will definitely will not be going back EVER! My daughter, husband and I arrived at the buffet first while the rest of the family were still parking there vehicles and helping my younger brother out the vehicle which he is in a wheelchair. Once we got to the cashier we specifically explained that we had a party of 14. We wanted to pay for our entry first while the rest of my family got there. The cashier was nice and told us it was no problem. We payed $55.00 plus 9.95 Tip. She specifically told us \" we are seating you in a table while the rest of the family gets here, and once they get here they pay and you guys can all seat together\". So we sat down and ate and explained everything to out waiter. The waiter said it was fine just to let her know and that we would have a different waiter. 10 minutes later my family arrives and so they get the table and once we go sit this so called manager named Rafael (Hispanic) tells us that we couldn't and that they had rules we didn't know about. He kept telling us that we couldn't seat together and kept arguing with my husband and older brother when we tried explaining him what the cashier had told us. My husband took him to the cashier so she could explain to him what she had told us and what she charged us for. The cashier told him what once we had explained to him and he yelled at her in front of other costumers that she was wrong for doing that and that she didn't know what she was doing. This so called manager was so wrong in so many levels. He as a manager should have had a different attitude and tried to make the problem better which he did the opposite. I for work in costumer service and know how you should treat your costumers. My husband is an executive chef at the Bellagio and knows that's not how you treat your customers. We kept explaining to him everything in English and kept telling us to speak to him in Spanish which, for myself is an insult as if trying to say that we couldn't speak right English while speaking to him. The waitress was more considerate that she went up to this so called manager and asked him if it was okay if she sat us at another different table by our family members. He kept saying no and arguing with my brother and husband for at least 5 minutes. He eventually said okay and we got to sit at a table next to out family not with our family which we had paid for to begin with. To top it off, he kept walking around the tables my family and I were sitting in laughing at us. I have no words for what we experience today. Such a poor costumer service. Sad."}
{"text":"Nice environment. Plenty of different foods and desserts. My wife and I were taken to a crowded section squeezed in between two other groups. We asked to be moved to another less crowded area. They had lots of sections where nobody was sitting. Anyway, we got seated in a less crowded area.  The roast beef was cold and tough. The rest of the sides- green beans, carrots, mac and cheese were also cold. The desserts tasted old and were a little hard. The strawberry puff was good. Overall, for the price, we were disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"Saturday is Seafood Night, no fried shrimp, no fried fish.  The vegetables were cold and the only thing worth eating were the shaved snow crab legs were good, but cold and the boiled shrimp was not peeled and cold too. 

Desserts were sloppy looking and picked over ---we were there at 7 pm.  Waitress was slow and every time we got up seed to have a big cart in the one path in and out to our table area, which was piled with filthy dishes.  It was kinda disgusting.  

My recommendation is to skip this buffet."}
{"text":"Remodeled and now a very awesome 5 star buffet! It was a good 3.5-4 star buffet before but a lot has improved. 

I enjoyed all the food! 
Salad bar was great. Fresh everything, nice thick dressing. Great tacos and nachos. Good meats and mashed potatoes. Even the French fries and soups were wonderful. 

Decor and seating is pleasing and comfortable. Not to smokey like the rest of the casino. Music is bad but not too loud at least. 

I could dock a star but another server made up for our first server who took on 30 person group and literally just left us and never came back. Not even to say sorry or check in at all. Odd. The seating ladies, most drink servers, and the cashier were very nice. I'll not dock any stars for the one employee because overall it's a good team working. 

I plan on coming back much more often now."}
{"text":"I would not recommend!  Nothing was exceptional at all. Lots of choices but nothing was great. Service was ok. Prime rib was raw.  Mexican food was not good.  Chinese was not good. Desserts were average. Pizza like frozen. Shrimp were tiny and peel and eat.  Workers behind Buffett seamed disinterested in their jobs."}
{"text":"I had probably one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had in my life today at Aliante buffet.  I took my kids to a celebratory dinner on Saturday night and as usual they asked to go to Aliante buffet because they love it.  We showed up at 8:55 and the hostess told me they close at 9 and they start pulling food at 9:30, my kids love it so we decided to eat there.  As soon as we got to the buffet they had started pulling food, and by 9:30 90% of the food was gone.  I asked to speak to a manager and Dan came to talk to me.  He told me that I should have expected to not have all the choices that are usually there because I came in just before close.   He never once apologized or offered to get me the food that I should have been offered.  If you are going to charge me the same amount of money that you charge everyone else you should offer me the same experience that everyone else gets.  I have worked in restaurants for 20 years and offer the same experience to the person that comes in at 6pm, as I do to the person that comes in 5 minutes before close.  I used to go to Aliante buffet about once a month and now will probably never come back."}
{"text":"No, it's not high class buffet like Caesar or Wicked Spoon. But then again, you're comparing $45 to $15. Lines are never to long for the buffet, even during prime dinner time. Most days, there are prime rib that is decent. Succulent meat and taste is there. I also like eating their shrimp with cocktail sauce here. Unlike some other buffets in Vegas, the cocktail shrimp here taste fresh and have that good seafood taste. I do enjoy the simpler American side dishes here. Mac and cheese, baked beans, mashed potatoes, etc. Dessert is nice as well. They have a gelatin bar that they serve you and cheesecake is creamy with a good crust. 

Don't bother with the Chinese food. Maybe I'm super critical because I'm Chinese, but that hot and sour soup is a joke -  taste nothing like it. Egg rolls inside is too soggy.

I give this 3 stars because for $15 and the lack of waiting in line, it's hard to beat in Vegas. As long as you enter knowing full well what you paid, you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"Just give me the beef ribs and prime rib from the carvers station and I'll be happy.  When a family of four can eat there for 20 bucks (with coupon), all you need is to impress me with about 10 dishes that I can rotate on all of my trips.

The Orleans is like the Costco of casinos: not much flash, but plenty of value.  Their buffet is the same to me.  Give me value: great food, low prices, and cleanliness and I'll stick around.  Alcohol prices are super cheap and the waiters are responsive and friendly.  The kiddies love the dessert bar, and I like the constant rotation of the food.  Chalk one up for the little guy."}
{"text":"Love this buffet, get the players club card for the discount.  Very great selection of dinner food items but I have to avoid over eating here just because it's that good!  Pace yourself by trying a little scoop of everything is my advice.

I love the taco meat here, super powerful flavor but not overbearing.  It's one of the first things i get on my plate.  I have to say check out the salad bar it's great and I'm picky eater..  I grab lettuce from the salad bar and head out to the Tex Mex for taco meat and shredded cheese. Go crazy and add black olives or whatever you like.


The desserts here are better than most buffets on the same parr.  I prefer to have the ice cream of I'm going to go for dessert."}
{"text":"It's was a great buffet .. especially when they got remodeled now it sucks they quit serving crab legs I'll take my business elsewhere"}
{"text":"The food was really good. Everything was made fresh. The buffet is very clean and spacious. I would definitely come here again. The only thing I would say they could improve on is the variety of foods are available."}
{"text":"This is what I called secondary buffet choice.  It's great value, decent selection and good food.  $7.99 (with a players card) for lunch can't be beat.
I like their fish and chips.   Collar green used to be my go-to vegetable choice, but lately it's very salty so I just stick with salad.  Each salad bar has different selection, so check out both if you want to have salad.  I would skip the Chinese, not even up to Panda Express quality.  My favorite dessert is the walnuts tart.  Ice cream didn't taste like ice cream, more like yogurt or something very artificial."}
{"text":"If you want to know what the color beige tastes like. Eat here.  Nothing good, nothing terrible pretty much bland and dry across the board.  

Sushi option is small and awful.  Breads are dry and hard.  Salad bar is so small with few options.  All the meats taste pretty much the same.  

You can do better for your money at any other buffet in town.

Update:  decided to give them another try since Boyd has taken over the property.

Food was good and fresh.  Options were limited but not lacking.  Will definitely go back now that they have their act together again!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch this afternoon.I had seen photos of the newly renovated buffet and I was curious to see if it looked as good as the photos.I am happy to say that it did.It is one of the most modern,beautiful and aesthetically appealing buffets I have ever been to.The lighting and colors have a really positive feel to them.To use an Asian term,it had a real good Feng Shui,IMHO.The servers were quite good,coming over frequently to remove empty plates and refilling beverages.The dessert selection seemed quite good,although I only availed myself of a couple of items as I am trying to restrict my sugar intake.Having said all of the above,I must say that I wasn't really impressed with the overall quality of the main food items.Don't get me wrong.I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy the meal or that it was industrial sewage like you would get at Circus Circus.It was probably a bit better then than the offerings at the old French Market buffet that the Orleans used to have.It's just that a lot of the dishes just seemed to be lacking in a certain pizzazz.I would not have a problem coming here again for another meal as long as it was discounted like the one I had today.To me,their prices are about $5.00 more per meal then what I would ideally like to pay.But if you do choose to eat here,I doubt that you'll be disappointed.There is such a large selection that you should get a full meal.Just don't expect really incredible food.Of course,you're also not paying a really exorbitant price.Enjoy."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this buffet! The food is fresh, delicious, there's a large variety, and it is very clean! We love Aliante Casino, so the fact they have such a great buffet is a huge bonus. We love their Friday night seafood buffet, my husband loves the crab legs, my daughter loves the salmon, and I love their fish n chips. We even went here for Thanksgiving and were so pleased; classic turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, ham, green bean casserole, sweet potatoes, pumpkin pie....just awesome. The service is excellent, fast, friendly, accommodating, and polite. Great salad bar, fresh fruit, American, Asian, Soul Food, Italian, dessert, I can't say enough good things. Try it out if you want to get away from the busy strip and outrageous prices. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The only great thing about the place is the price; it simply can't be beat. But what you pay is what you get.
It was our first meal after arriving to LV so we were pretty starved. Seated right away.
Food was good but not great. Like it lacked zazz. The hot and sour soup sucked (way to sour).
I did enjoy the potato salad, of all things. And I think the mongolian station was the best station because the food was actually flavorful. 

Dessert was the best part! (though i wish they had more fruit options). I got some peach cobbler (my fave dessert) and some honeydew on the side. soooo good. And some hot tea with honey and lemon [on a 103F day haha] to finish my meal.

Not bad, not fabulous. Great price."}
{"text":"Great buffet for the price. Of course you can go to a fancy buffet on the strip but the price will triplicate."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a ton of times. It's ok. You get everything you want. There's American, Asian, Italian, Mexican, and an extensive salad bar. Pretty much your typical local casino buffet. Nothing will stole you as awesome, but it's all edible. Salad bar is loaded. I do like the Mongolian grill. Lots of dessert options including a chocolate fountain."}
{"text":"went today @ 2pm horrible Asian waitress only came by my table once, looked at me crazy when I asked for more napkins. Everything was absolutely cold not even luke-warm. what a shame @ $15.95 , on a Friday just cold fishsticks and hard fries, loads of pizza that no one was touching. the taco meat was hard very dark brown and congealed.     I want my damn money back...Now!"}
{"text":"Remodelled Orleans Buffet now called MEDLEY BUFFET. Ox tail melts in your mouth and loved the steamed dumpling. duck was tasteful.  Very modern feel and spacious. Great selection.  Sign up with their players card and you get a different discount"}
{"text":"We received 4 free buffet vouchers in the mail from Boyd Gaming so we decided to try this place out on their seafood buffet night. I believe it costs $27.99 for dinner on Fridays. The line was super long and the wait was about 30 minutes. Not too bad considering this is their most popular night. 

The crab and oysters were fresh and plentiful. The food in general is decent. We like to make our own dipping sauce for the crab and bring it since we don't care much for the butter they provide. We basically stack a mountain of crab on a plate and start cracking away. We tried a few other like the spare ribs, smoked sausage, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, and clam chowder as side helpings to the crab. Nothing stands except for the service which is always attentive and professional."}
{"text":"This buffet is disgusting and not worth $20 a dinner at all! Do not waste your time!!!!! Go anywhere else and it will be better. The food is not fresh, all premade, even the dessert was bad. I mean how do you mess up a brownie?!"}
{"text":"Yep, things have changed!  The new design in the buffet area is really hard to understand.  There is a massive hallway in the middle of the dining area that is not used, from what we could see.  The food is now distributed all along the back rather than utilizing cold tables just to the fore of hot service.  It was so convenient.  We both picked two different eggs Benedict for breakfast that were supposedly on steam tables in terrines, which looked warm and savory.  They were both cold and awful.  Neither one of us could eat them.  So wasteful.  Waiting for a table was also long and weary, even though the number of people was about 20.  I wish I could give our once-favorite buffet a good rating.  We've gone to the Orleans for years!"}
{"text":"Sat down with my parents and children for breakfast. Seemed like a nice place to eat. Kids ordered milk and as soon as they got it, the 3 and 4 year old started to spit it out saying it tasted funny. I took a swig and sure enough just about gagged. My father being as anal is as he is about serving bad food and causing mass illness in a public place, became concerned and notified the drink server and the waiter who didn't seem too concerned and told us they'd replace theirs with juice. Being the kids lost their appetite from the milk they didn't eat much. Again on the way out my father told the hostess that the milk could make people sick and they should have it replace. Her response in a sweet smiling way explained 'I'll be sure to let security know.' Seriously? How patronizing can you be to customers. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I think this is the updated, renovated version of the Orleans buffet. For $21 weekday dinner, it is such a good place to eat for the flavors, and the value. I enjoyed the prime rib and bone-in ham. I enjoyed the run raisin sauce, and the various desserts, specially the Bananas Foster. Darn, I forgot to get any of the hand-made crepes. I was just desserted-out. What I think could be improved is the seafood selection. The shrimp scampi was nothing special. But overall, the food, cost, and service is for me the current best value in Vegas."}
{"text":"Basic Vegas buffet that's Popular with some locals I'm guessing mostly because the prices are some of the lowest in town.  They also offer good discount deals for their player's club members. The lines can get long if you come right at the peak of service (like 9am for breakfast; noon for lunch; or 6pm for diner).

They've got the various food stations based on either type of food or region.  BBQ, seafood, Asian, Mexican, Italian, etc. Two salad bar stations and a center desert island with cakes, pastries and ice cream round out the mix. 

The servers are all busy, efficient and make multiple stops by your table to fill drinks and take away plates as you grub your way through your meal session. 

Some of the food is decent, some you'll pass on depending on freshness and others you won't even touch.  That's what keeps a buffet fun and you on your toes."}
{"text":"Not to bad sometimes it's good, other times they don't fill up as fast so some of the food is  dry."}
{"text":"I am not a big buffet fan in general, but I was told the breakfast was great so in I went. The wait to be seated seemed avoidable as there were open 4 seat tables and booths. We were seated and greeted by Nena who took our drink order and we were on our way. Alot of good looking options, 2 omlet bars and a carving station for ham, meatloaf and sausage. Most of the food I tried was great and tasted fresh. I tried the cheese blintsz, a mini waffle, pancake, 3 different sausages, bacon and french toast and I cleaned my plates. I went back an tried their mexican bar, I had a taco some refried beans, a few tornados, guac, chilaquiles and a basket of chips. This is where that one star faded away. The food from the mexican bar had no defining flavors, nothing memorable, everything in a way tasted the same. The sauces were tame and didn't highlight any tastes in any of the foods. The chips in the baskets were chewy.
The service was phenomenal and the majority of the food was fresh tasting and great. Try it out you're bound to find something you like with so many choices."}
{"text":"A-ok. We have eaten here twice in the past few weeks: once for prime rib and crab legs, and tonight for shrimp and steak...which was a bummer, because we came for the crab legs and apparently they just changed it. The steak and shrimp options weren't too bad. If you come, make sure you sign up for the players card, because it gives you a pretty substantial discount. We also had just gotten a flyer in the mail for a buy one get one, which brought our total for five buffets down to $80, which wasn't bad at all. 
The service can be hit or miss-on our crab leg night, our drinks were empty, our table was a mess, and we couldn't even get napkins from anybody. Tonight the service was much better-constant refills and table cleaning and a huge stack of napkins when we sat down. We tend to only do buffets when family are in town, but it's a nice option to have the Aliante to get away from the Strip, and it's a little more updated than the Santa Fe. Overall it wasn't a bad experience and we'll probably be back when we have visitors again."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and breakfast this time. Both times were satisfying and everything tasted delicious. Dinner was $19.99 but you get $5 off if you're a member (players card). Breakfast was around  $9.00 per person. We really enjoyed it! It's nothing fancy but everything tasted great. We will definitely come back again! And the people that work in the hotel were all very polite."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I was rather impressed with the quality of the cuisine at the buffet. I'll begin on a positive note before delving into the depths of my irritation with this place. I went twice during my stay. Once for breakfast and once for dinner. The breakfast was one of the best breakfast buffets I have visited in a while and the dinner was pretty top notch as well. There was a good variety of steaks during the Saturday night dinner buffet with a good supporting cast of potatoes, veggies and other buffet staples. The grilled onions and sauteed mushrooms were a nice touch. The problem I have is with the mandatory 18 percent gratuity for a large party. We stayed at the Orleans over a weekend for a family reunion and gathering of friends who had not seen each other in some time. Our party for dinner was approaching 50 bodies and we got there prior to their opeing for dinner and gave plenty of notice ahead of time. We did not just show up and ask for a table for 50. We paid in small groups (immediate families, etc) and were all charged the 18 percent. I can see an 18 percent tip at a restaurant where the waiter or waitress takes your order, fills your drinks, deals with special requests and is attentive to your table. An 18 percent tip at a buffet is over the top to begin with, but outrageous when you consider the drinks were running empty and the waiter was rude and acted as though we were putting him out. The tip was in the $150 range for a lack luster, one-star performance from the waiter. If you have a casino \"Club Card\", you'll need one card for every two people to get the discount and there was no price break for children. The quality of the food was the saving grace, making this an overall three star rating for me."}
{"text":"The very definition of \"A-ok.\" You get what you pay for at this buffet. But even then, it's still miles ahead of what you'd find at Circus Circus or something. For $12 at lunch time, you can't go wrong with cafeteria-style enchiladas and pasta, and while it isn't as luxurious as Bellagio Buffet or quirky like Wicked Spoon, it gets the job done."}
{"text":"Not quite sure what the reviews are about the prices. We paid $28 a person and the place definitely made money on us. There were some nice choices however the food was simple-cafeteria style taste. I liked the Chinese food however I'd rather just go to Panda Express and save myself a bundle. People all around us had plates piled high with crab legs. We didn't try any since that's not our thing. The hotel is close to our house so we may try other restaurants however not too impressed with this buffet for the money. The device was good however."}
{"text":"On a whim, I ended up spending Easter in Vegas.  In search of an Easter-worthy buffet, we ended up at French Market Buffet in the Orleans.  I anticipated the worst, knowing that buffets can often be filled with steamed scrambled eggs and microwaved ham.  Much to my pleasant surprise (a la the Easter Bunny bringing me a basketball hoop when I was 12 years old), the food was absolutely delicious.  The buffet has food stations for different types of food, and they all have cooks behind them doing it up right.  The food was average priced, but so much better than any of the others I've had in Vegas (even the ones I did like).  Although there was a huge line, it went by surprisingly quickly because they had plenty of tables to seat everyone.  I took a chance on them for Easter, and I will absolutely be back on my next trip out."}
{"text":"I've visited this buffet for regular dinner service, weekend brunch, and holiday specials. For the most part this buffet is a great value with something for everyone, even a picky eater like me.

Highlights are the carving station, desserts, and the made-to-order areas. Everything else is divided by cuisine, with lots of flavor in the Asian dishes.

It can be difficult to get a server's attention for something like drink refills or extra silverware."}
{"text":"Came here lunch time on a weekday. Surprisingly long wait in line (maybe ~20-30min) but the line moved fairly quickly.

Nothing too special about this buffet. There's a lot of different options but beyond that, the flavor does not call for a repeat visit....EXCEPT the beef brisket. That was fantastic and I was so surprised. Juicy, fatty, great flavor and seasoning. A MUST get before you fill up with everything else. Because everything else is standard and not great.

Pros: Selection. Each section has a different theme to it so you can pick and choose what you're feeling. Big dessert and salad islands in the middle, but nothing special about the desserts, just your standard selection. Service is good, they're attentive with clearing plates and getting refills.
And to be fair, at ~$12 for a buffet, this place offers quite a lot, and is worth the costs."}
{"text":"Food is adequate.

The USO sponsors meals for families of deployed soldiers twice a month, once at the Cannery, and once at Aliante's buffet.

I participated last month. I had pizza, pasta, salad, and ice cream.
Everything was average, like you'd expect of a buffet, but still delicious.

The dessert area was awesome, as they had several cakes, pies, and cookies, plus a soft serve machine AND about 12 flavors of ice cream served from behind the counter, to choose from.

I'm not sure I would pay to go back there, unless I was at Aliante for some reason other than this monthly event, but it wasn't half bad. Service was impeccable for as jam packed as it was."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great. Staff is friendly food is good. I went around 1pm and it wasn't too busy which was nice. I'd recommend for your money's worth"}
{"text":"French Market Buffet at \"The Orleans Hotel\"
Overall
4 Stars

Gold medal - BEST Fried Chicken Wings
Silver medal - Great service
Bronze medal - Great price

The name is a bit deceiving.  It is not french food, but a mixture of Mexican, Chinese, Italian, & American.  Lots to choose from!

They have the BEST fried chicken.  It was crispy and juicy!!  I want more!!  They also had like 4 other types of chicken items.  Lots of variety to choose from.

The service is really a hit or miss, but during this last visit......... It was a HIT.  The server was super fast, nice, and attentive.  Every time we were done with our dishes he was there to clean it up.  He came by offering refills without us having to flag him down.  He was great. I even over tipped him.

We went on Saturday during Memorial Day weekend.  They did not increase the price to Holiday pricing, which was nice.  It was still $10.99 for lunch.  If you have a players card you, +1 guest are $1 off each.  $9.99 for a HUGE buffet selection is not bad at all!

HAPPY OVEREATING!!"}
{"text":"The quality of food has declined over the years, and it may be due to Aliante departing from Station Casinos. Who knows, but it remains an affordable dining option at this property and in the surrounding area. 

There's a \"medley\" of offerings that you could find at most buffets. The difference here is that the food didn't look appetizing, specifically the wilted lettuce at the salad bars. I stuck to eating the \"Asian\" food, which has familiar offerings like beef with broccoli, chow mein, lemon chicken, egg rolls, and pork belly. Not bad. 

The dessert section isn't exciting. It consists of donuts, slices of assorted fruit and cream pies, cookies, brownies, and ice cream. Sugar-free options are also available.


Sundays lure in the crowds and are one of their busiest days. Anticipate waiting in line for over a half-hour, especially if there's only ONE person working at the register. A discount is offered to customers with Aliante players club cards. This is beneficial if you want to a save few extra bucks."}
{"text":"This buffet is currently being remodeled. A temporary buffet is open 8am-2pm. The food is banquet style. Not hot or fresh. Beef ribs cold and dry. Waited 30 minutes for an omelet on wedesday. Not much selection. Very unorganized. Not happy at all."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience at the French Market Buffet, the waitress (Judy) told our table to \"shut up and listen so I don't repeat myself\" then she said the drinks they carry.  I responded by asking her if she was in a bad mood? She said no why!! Then I said because you're being very rude to us.  She stated I'm not being rude and said she will get someone else to serve us.  Then I followed her and she was talking to the hostess Ana and they both were laughing, so I approached both of them and said I don't think it's funny.  Ana responded and said \"oh we are not laughing at you\", I then said I needed to speak to management.   I got to speak to the supervisor who had me and my friend write a report.  We then were approached by the manager (Rhonda Turner) who I feel was very professional in handling such situation.  I also want to state that the waiter they sent (Felipe) was very attentive and super polite.  Kudos to them both!!! 
I can't believe the bad service we received here and won't be returning.  I still left a tip because Felipe gave us good service the remaining of the time.  
One star as we waited 40 minutes for our drinks and the terrible experience from the first waitress Judy!!!!"}
{"text":"I couldn't pass up this $7.77 buffet special for locals inside the Orleans Casino.  It is 1/2 of the regular price of their evening buffet and they had prime rib too.  I haven't been to this buffet for a long long time, so this was the perfect opportunity to rediscover this buffet.  I was impressed by the selection of hot food items.  The prime rib, though, was on the dry side (overcooked).  My wife really enjoyed the jambalaya and pulled bbq pork with fried onions pizza.  I know it sounds pretty weird to me but she said it tasted pretty good.  I, on the other hand enjoyed the crayfish,  Their sushi was freshly made which was nice, compared to other local buffets around town which served day old and dried out sushi.  I would definitely go back for this price.  Okay, maybe not for a couple of week, since I ate way too much in one sitting."}
{"text":"The first thing you should notice is the price and for this one, you know you are going to have a baaaaaad time. I went on a Saturday for brunch. 

Service was quick and efficient so no complaints there. Now getting food is where the ordeal begins because the tongs were on fire! Seriously, trying to pick up food with 100 degree tongs is not fun. 

The fried chicken was decent. The pancakes, waffles, and French toast were very hard. The bacon was overflowing so that's a plus.

My wife on the other hand did not enjoy anything she tried which was breakfast potatoes, roast beef and sushi. Why would she try the sushi ? Smh

If you are hungover and staying at Aliante then maybe this is the place to go, other than that it's a pass."}
{"text":"We came here to eat the Sunday Brunch and it didn't disappoint.  The line was not that long and the guy working the desk allowed us to go get a Players card and come back to the front of the line.  You get a dollar off just cause you have a players card.  The Sunday Brunch was from 8:00 am - 3:00 pm and it was only $16.99.  Free Champagne was Served to Guests throughout the meal.  The Buffet restaurant was packed and the price was worth every PENNY!


On the buffet line going from right to left he French Market Buffet had many different dishes to choose from.  I had to get two dishes, a plate of meat like i was on the atkins diet and one plate of everything else. They had Italian, Mongolian, Barbecue, American, Seafood, Mexican and Chinese food as well as an huge dessert bar with plenty of desserts to choose from.  They had some delicious bbq pork ribs and yummy smoked ribs.  The Smoked Ribs to me was the highlight of the meal.  The bacon was nice and crispy.   My lady had sushi and she hit the huge salad bar that they offered.  She also got her some sushi which she truly enjoyed.


Overall, One of the best buffets I have ever been too. I would have gave them a five.  My only complaint was that the Crawfish and jambalaya that they offered didn't taste like back home.  Need a little bit more salt but I will Definitely be visiting this casino and its buffet again in the future."}
{"text":"Just awful.   We've been eating here for years and it just keeps getting worse and worse.  Nothing new, nothing different, just poorer and poorer quality food.  From the beef that can't be chewed, to the ham with no flavor, to the dried-out turkey and the watery so-called gelato.....everything is barely even edible these days.   Had a great breakfast/brunch at the Sunset Station in Henderson and we're going to start staying there in the future as the food prices are reasonable and the quality is much much better.  Too bad, because Orleans used to have one of the better buffets."}
{"text":"New Buffett at the Orleans. Newly remodeled and branded. It was a good solid Buffet experience."}
{"text":"Please note that this buffet has been remodeled so be careful of older reviews. 

I was pretty impressed with this buffet, honestly. I went for lunch on a Saturday since we happened to be here. Line was fairly long but kept moving quickly. Be mindful that lunch ends at 3:30 but they stop ringing people up at 3:00. 

The place has a very nice variety of food, especially for a frequent buffet lover like myself. They had some odd noodle dishes, fresh pork tacos, a noodle station.  They also had the requisite omelet station and three pans - which means the line moves pretty quickly. I felt like overall the food was pretty fresh and wasn't sitting out. 

I wouldn't go out of my way for this buffet, but if you're already at the Orleans it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the quality and selection of food during our lunch visit.  The roast beef was tough and did not have much flavor.  I knew it was going to be tough watching the server cut it.  Then, he did not even trim the fat away.  The turkey was really tender and good but the dressing seemed old and stale.  The corn on the cob looked old and did not have much taste.  It did not seem that there was an effort to keep the food fresh and hot.  Service was not anything special.  Really disappointed.  Don't think that we will return"}
{"text":"How do I even start? 

Line was lonng, considering it was Labor Day and they had wrestlers in town.

Here, some workers just looked Unhappy with their job. It was packed and it was noticeable on their face at their frustration, especially with some cooks in the back. When a customer tried to make small talk and ask about the food the cook just gave him a nasty glare and shrugged. I don't expect the cooks to be all jolly, but it just felt since they aren't acknowledging guests then how can I expect them to make tasty quality food if they don't give a f$!k?! Plus, our waiter needed an attitude adjustment. I asked for sprite and she rolled her eyes. 

Honestly, I only enjoyed the spring rolls and salad bar. I took a leap of faith with the passionfruit \"gelato\" (It looks like the gelato melts and they just refreeze it). 

I was disappointed in the fried rice *sad face* and their sub sandwhich. The bread tasted rubbery and very dry while the fried rice was REALLY PLAIN. I felt like whoever prepared the fried rice did NOT know what they were doing. Now I understand why it was barely touched. 

If I were to come back I would visit the BBQ spot. The guy on that side seemed very attentive and the food looked DELISH. 

But I will returning when I have an appetite for that side."}
{"text":"3.4

I've had better food and the same quality of food for way more money in Vegas buffets.  What this place supplies is reasonable food at a price point less than many of the other buffets around.  I went for their steak and crab Wednesday, $15,99 less a dollar discount for being a guest at the hotel.  The crab legs were spindly and the steak was a bit tough but cooked to the medium I asked for.  The swordfish wasn't bad and I noticed several folks with whole plates of crawfish.  Many of the folks seemed to be locals and although I had no wait at 5:00 by the time I was done the place was full and a long line had formed.  They do not rush the diners in the restaurant.  There were plenty of food choices.  I gave up after 4 plates, the last of which was desert.  Because of the number of people everything I tried was still hot or cold as needed.  The vanilla soft serve had given up so I had chocolate ice cream with my peach cobbler.  The service was really quick and I noticed those folks requiring bar service got their drinks quickly.  My one big complaint was my plates got cleared while I was getting another and my service, complete with whatever was on them, was set on the table rather than waiting for me to get back and transfer them to my new plate so I would get a separate plate to put them on on the first trip.  

For the price this was an excellent value."}
{"text":"It's a remodeled French Market Buffet. The decode is modern with open theme, but I think it lack personality. I guess everyone uses the same designer. Palm's new 24 Cafe has similar decor. I have the seafood buffet. They raised the price by about $3/person without raising the food quality. The food selection is the same, but the quality becomes a little worse. For example, the crab legs are much smaller than before. 
The worse part is the service. Our server is Loiter.  She never refilled our drinks. She just cleaned out the dishes. She can walked up to me and asked was everything ok when my glass in front of me was empty. Could you just open your eyes and see we need refills? My friend and I stayed to have some girly talks. Our server just walked past at least 5 times without making eye contact or refilling our drinks. She probably trying to chase us away, so she can rest. 
Anyway, I won't recommend this place. It's over price with so so food and bad services."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!!
Kaori is the best waitress I'm here right now for brunch and so far I have had so much champagne, for 2 people I paid 23 and some change!!! All you can drink mimosas sat and sun 9-3 pm!!!! The food is delicious I'm drunk lol!!! I'll be back tomorrow FORSURE lol."}
{"text":"Just because you are staying at this hotel, it doesn't mean you should eat here. We were tired from traveling and wanted somewhere to eat that was close and convenient. Food is bland and nothing out of the ordinary as far as your common buffet. Not worth $18."}
{"text":"It was Sunday and we didn't want Champagne brunch.  So, this buffet offered a regular breakfast buffet for less $$.  We happily dined here for our breakfast!  

The food was decent.  The selection was pretty good for breakfast, they served the usual breakfast items but they also had Italian, Chinese, Seafood selections as well.  It was good!"}
{"text":"My favorite buffet in vegas, every time I come to vegas I make sure to stop by here. The food is really great and the prices arent too bad, especially for a buffet in vegas. Plus the dessert section is amazing."}
{"text":"It was super busy when we went....it was Sunday Brunch.  It did take us a while to get a table for 4.  
--TONS of food options.....but I would stay away from the Chinese menu on the Buffet.  Lacked flavor. 
--Salad bar was adequate....more veggie options would have been good. Ranch dressing was pretty good......Probably the best thing on the buffet was the Potato Latkes.....so much better than the breakfast potatoes.   None of us tried the seafood so can't say if it was good or not.  Our guests raved about the pizza and taco bar.....but I think the actual breakfast was the best.  We had coupons so the price was good.....I would return....maybe not for Wok Wednesdays tho"}
{"text":"This buffet has a good selection. The problem is that they don't have enough people eating here. Every time I'm in there is no line and over half empty tables. This creates a good issue. The food doesn't turn quick enough so it gets old and dead. What you need to do is eat within an hour of the meal starting time so all the food is fresh and just put out."}
{"text":"Boy, was I surprised when I walked by and saw this completely remodeled buffet.  I've been staying at the Orleans for Vegas trips for the past 15 years.  I've had the old French Market Buffet more times than I can count and it has always been this drab depressing place with horrible food.  Well, all that has changed.  The Medley Buffet is all new and modernized!

I came for week day dinner and it was $18.99 with players club card.  They have extended the buffet line and there are so many more choices that look much more appetizing and inviting.  The food is overall much improved.  I really liked their smoked pork spare ribs, the braised oxtail, and the menudo.  The old New Orleans items are still there, so rest assured you can still get chicken and sausage gumbo as well as red beans and rice.  The gumbo seems less spicy than it used to be, but nothing a little Tabasco can't fix.  I also really liked the al pastor tacos with the meat actually being cut from the rotating spit.

They also serve crawfish, although when we went they were frozen crawfish from last season.  They were gigantic in size and tasted quite good for being frozen.  They were cooked well enough that you could still take the first ring off and pinch the tail to get the meat to come out all at once.  I hope as crawfish season picks up, they switch over to the live stuff.  It's happened in the past at French Market Buffet, so no reason it can't happen at the upgraded Medley Buffet.

Some items have not changed.  The hushpuppies and fried catfish are pretty dry.  The pizzas look anemic and greasy.  The desserts, while upgraded, are still stuff that's brought in instead of being made in-house.

The staff seem to have more of a spring in their steps and even the clientele seems upgraded.  No longer is this buffet just full of old locals eating for free after earning 200 points.  It felt like I was eating at M Resort.

With this new upgrade, Orleans leapfrogged many local buffets and even many strip buffets.  I'd say the order goes Bacchanal at Caesars, then Studio B at M Resort, then Medley Buffet in a tie with Feast Buffet at Red Rock, then Wynn, Bellagio, and the 3rd tier stuff at the Harrah's resorts."}
{"text":"Tonight my brother in law wanted to celebrate his birthday at the buffet. We were a party a 14 people as my sister in law got in earlier to save a table for us the girl at the register said that she would charge the gratitude tip of 15% so everyone could sit together. Everything was explained clearly but when we all got there the maneger named Rafael was being rude from the time we were paying to the time to sitting us. we paid over 200 dallaras close to $300  and we waited a long time as he said they didn't have a table for us and he didn't want to have someone put tables together for us he was arguing and being rude to my  husband and brother in law he has bad customer service and he was being racist. We had to sit in 3 different tables Evan thou we pain the 15% gratitude. The the receptionist Said paying the 15% gratitude is for us to be able to sit together and it didn't happen. We had the worst experience ever altho our waiter was being nice and the receptionist was being nice 2 it was almost as if she was afraid of him 2. They should lower his position he shouldn't be a maneger or he should go to costumer service classes because he is rude and he argues and he fallows you to keep arguing and while we were eating he keeps passing by with a smirk on his face like laughing at us. If that man is still there I don't recommend going to eat there at all......."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the Saturday night BBQ Buffet. About $24 including tax and drink. So not bad on the wallet. Buffet overall was just OK. Not really a BBQ buffet as claimed but they did have a good variety of different ribs and some sausage. But no other true BBQ meats. For example when I think of BBQ I think of brisket, pulled pork, BBQ hot link, Yams, Sweet tea and banana pudding. Which they had none of.  I was actually happily surprised by the Craw fish they were huge. The rest of the buffet was just OK and As far as desserts they were terrible very cheap and very little quality."}
{"text":"For a buffet which I normally don't go to buffets hardly at all in the city of many buffets.  The food was absolutely great for a buffet but the food and the selection of food could not make up for the lack of attention by staff from getting drinks to being friendly at the checkout. I don't care what it was we were made to feel like it was asking far too much of them to do anything we ask for a refill on one soda one time and then before we left I asked for a to go cup for tea because I don't drink with my meals at all hardly we don't have to go cups and you can't take a markup on to the floor of the casino. Also I took four times of requesting Tabasco sauce for some of the meal before we got it and then it was like we were troubling the staff to actually help so rather than leave a tip like we had done on the credit card. So we returned to the checkout stand and retracted the tip from it. This is one of those places that make me feel that even though it's free to go eat there because of comped me almost due to gaming play I refused to that pretty much means the Aliante casino not get any of my business thank you very much and have a good day."}
{"text":"I would give this a 3.5 actually because of the outstanding remodel and much improvement in food quality ! Here's what I liked. There was more salad variety, like seafood, edamame, cucumber. The hit items like Asian and Mexican fare look more fresh and appetizing  .We also noticed more of a variety in desserts as well. My favorites, oxtail soup , edamame salad, and Mexican corn !  Very very good !  layout is more spacious without the stations in the middle for cold items like it was before. What I couldn't understand was the Caesar salad station placed far away from the others and the breakfast was still being served at 1230pm. I feel like they were just there to fill space . Otherwise,  I still suggest you check it out !"}
{"text":"This is one of the most shittiest place for buffets on a Saturday night which is prime rib and shrimp the shrimp sucks the prime rib sucks they are such a ripoff my daughter just made five years old and she had to pay $18.99! When you look on their website it's a $17.99 for the prime rib shrimp Buffet but it's actually $18.99 when you come here and if you don't have a card it's $22.99 They don't even have everything thats labeled up there on the glass.. the place Crazy Buffet is 10 times better than this Buffet here at this hotel. All I can say is they've lost a customer I WILL NEVER BE BACK TO THIS SHITTY BUFFET!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best buffet for all you can eat crab legs on Friday nights. The selection of other foods is also pretty good.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"Tuesday dinner buffet is Hawaiian night with the roasted pig----the meat was soft and juicy and the skin was crispy. The other dinner entrées include American, Asian, Mexican,  & Italian. I would recommend this buffet if you happen to be in the area. Seafood night on Fridays offer all you can  eat snow crab legs."}
{"text":"Medley Buffet, big deal. You serve the same style of food as any other buffet.  Boyd Gaming bought you years ago from Station Casinos. This might explain why you still look like the buffet at Red Rock Casino and Spa.

Where is the originality? Give people a reason to drive to to North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't love Vegas for its gambling or partying, well I do  but mainly for its FOOD!!! 
Every time I come to Vegas I must try a new buffet or restaurant. And this time it wasn't the  exception.  So, I gave this place a try. They literally deserve 3 stars. Everything, including ambiance is MEH. Idk if we were here on a bad day but their employees  seem barely alive to say the least. They have a variety of food, which I gave everything a try and it wasn't horrible but it wasn't good. Definitely not recommending this place, unless you don't care much for your food."}
{"text":"ORLEANS:  The French Market Buffet is located in the Orleans and I love it. 
It has a ton of options for a very affordable price. Not to mention, it's all-you-can-eat!  

VARIETY:  The variety of food available is very diverse. Great for picky eaters, I guess, because of range of food is almost ridiculous! Dinner buffet was my fave; breakfast was a close second. 

Here's a general idea of the dinner spread:
-Fresh and cooked seafood: crab, shrimp, clams, crawfish, sushi, you name it.
-Chinese: stir fry station, noodles, spring rolls, etc.
-American: ribs, steak, etc.
-Mexican: burritos and such
-Several different pastas
-Soup
-Salad bar 
-Dessert bar with a gelato case!

SWEETS:  The desert bar/station will satisfy any sweeth tooth!  Diabetic and all!  I'm so happy to say that they have a whole sugar-free dessert section for all you health nuts and diabetics.  I like to eat and sample sugar-free desserts every now and then, and these desserts are scrumptious.  This buffet dessert station may quite possibly have the best tasting sugar-free banana cream pie I have ever tasted! It tasted better than many regular banana cream pies I've tried! 

VERDICT:  This buffet is definitely a go!  (Who could turn down such a tasty and affordable buffet??!) 
No doubt I will be back for more of that delish sugar-free banana cream pie and that amazing spread.  :)"}
{"text":"Haven't been to the Orleans dinner buffet in quite a while...went there tonight, a Monday, for their prime rib featured buffet.  Guess the prices have recently been raised, with my club card, it still cost me $16.50.

Prime rib was dry (I tried it 2 or 3 times--the au jus didn't help...recovering from over eating while I type this), the rest of the selections were truly average and unremarkable.

Compared to other LAS buffets on a Monday night, there are much better (a) values and (b) quality to be had.

Very disappointed, unlikely I'll return to the Orleans feeding frenzy in the future.

Didn't use to be like this..."}
{"text":"For a southern style buffet, this place sucks...everything is flavorless unless it has sauce. What I did like about this place was that they had individual sections for each ethnic foods.  Still didn't do much for taste.  Even their freshly cut ribs were terrible (not to mention their dry roast beef)....$18 down the drain...had 2 plates and bailed cause I couldn't see stuffing myself with flavorless food."}
{"text":"Very good selection, and good tasting. Healthy choices too at almost every station. My daughter says to avoid the canolis. The pizza was actually very good. Be sure to watch their close times (lunch ends at 3), but better value for lunch over dinner."}
{"text":"The worst buffet I have ever tried in Las Vegas yet! Everything was dried out and I went there on a Friday during a dinner rush, so everything should be fresh. There is no reason for the food to be dried out or way overcooked. The stuffing was a huge disappointment for me and that is one of my favorite foods. I did not enjoy a single between the Chinese, Italian, and American options. I will not go back."}
{"text":"I'm not a very picky eater because I don't enjoy cooking.  For me, the effort (grocery shopping, cleaning, prepping, chopping, stirring, frying, etc.) and time is not worth it - especially if it doesn't turn out well.  I'm so exhausted from my Graveyard Shift job, that sometimes I'll skip a meal because I'd rather sleep.  That's why I truly appreciate anything anyone cooks.  I understand the work that went into combining ingredients to create a meal.

With this in mind, I especially enjoy Senior Days at the Orleans Casino.  It used to be on Tuesdays, but now it is Wednesday.  After collecting 50 points on your B Connected Players Card, you earn a free breakfast or lunch buffet.  After 100 points, you get a free dinner buffet.  I believe I earned both a lunch and a dinner buffet!

I have been to pricier, higher quality buffets like the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan, but for the price (free), I can find good enough food at the French Market Buffet. 

For example - the dessert section... the fluffy cheesecake; and the strawberry torte.  I wish the torte's crust was on the lemon meringue pie!  I try to eat things that I don't normally make, such as the bread pudding, chocolate cream pie, and the gelato.  Those are pretty good.  Remember to get a plastic spoon from the dispenser!

The Italian section was okay - there was pizza, pasta, garlic bread, and lasagna.  Nothing really outstanding.  The pizza crust was on the thicker, softer side.

The BBQ area was interesting with its collard greens, yams, black eyed peas, hush puppies, ribs, and fried okra.  I had a well-done rib and enjoyed the crispy edges!  

The Asian foods were adequate: spring rolls, Hot & Sour Soup, Egg Drop Soup, crab sushi, and shrimp tempura sushi...  The noodles loooked spooky, so I just had one for good luck. Some dishes looked sad and overcooked, like they had been there a while... 

The salad bar looked fresh.  The fruits (cantaloupe, honeydew, and watermelon) were relatively sweet.  The peel and eat cocktail shrimp moves here at dinnertime so the crawfish can take its place at the Seafood station.  Dinner buffet includes Prime Rib at the carving station.  Breakfast buffet includes an omelette station.  

I skipped over the Mexican section because by that time, I was full.  I had a bite of macaroni and cheese for my niece, but it was bland.  

The service is quick and efficient.  The atmospere is energetic with many people moving here & there.  It's like a variety show!  The coffee refills are often.  Raspberry iced tea is available.

The long line to get in moves well.  There are many, many chairs and tables for singles and large groups.  It's just a basic buffet for everyone of all age groups to fill up.  The variety and value are noteworthy!"}
{"text":"When the Orleans was still fairly new in the 90's I can remember my family and I mean my ENTIRE family would come to eat here because of our aunts who gambled received fairly good comps. However, those days are obviously in the past and I seedom see myself going into this Casino. Recently came here on a week day for lunch costing $8.99. This was a reception for event I attended prior, making it free for all of us! I was at the same buffet 2 years ago and remember it being not that good. Contrary to belief, this time around it was better. The Korean style ribs was decent, not the best, but definitely edible. The BBQ section also had pretty tasty selections. I tried the pasta with alfredo sauce, which had a nice texture and a flavorful garlic taste. I had tirimisu for dessert and I enjoyed that as well. Overrall, \"good enough.\" I don't think I would pay money to eat at this buffet, but the food was good and didn't make me sick."}
{"text":"First of all, bad news for you crawfish fanatics - they have a notice saying they won't be serving them for the foreseeable future. 

I stay at the Orleans a lot because of the gambling and because I get comped (although I'm not exactly a whale - more like a minnow). So I often eat here. This trip I discovered Anton's Secret to Buffeting: try having a meal more like you would in a regular restaurant, that is by courses, or by themes. Usually I sample a bit of everything to make sure I don't miss anything good, but really, this isn't the only time I'm ever going to eat here, so why not be a little more discriminating? 

For example, on this visit I had dinner here twice. The first night I did it strictly Mexican. It was not bad but not memorable - maybe the double tequila had something to do with that. On the second night, I had a full course meal: a seafood appetizer - shrimp and clams, a salad, and an entrée of sliced-to-order roast beef with vegetables (although I did sneak  in a yummy rib). And pecan pie for dessert (ok - I also had some bread pudding - but how can you go to Las Vegas and not have bread pudding?). All was certainly as good as your average restaurant, but a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"WORST BUFFET EVER!!!!

Seafood lovers beware! Oysters and clams on the half shell were dried out and tasted so bad that I had to spit it out. YUCK! Prime rib is dry that Au Jus did even moisten the meat which leads me to believe that they didn't allow the meat to rest before slicing allowing all the natural juices to run out.

Hot snowcrab legs were iffy at best, over steamed making the flesh mushy. 

Only the desserts were considered acceptable so that means the pastry chef is better at his/her craft than the head chef.

I am never EVER going back."}
{"text":"Second time coming here. The selection is decent for the amazing price. Less than $9 if paying cash. Everything I sample was good. Coffee is good too. Friendly staff as well. This is now my go to plave for breakfast while I am in town. Recommend."}
{"text":"Much improvement since the renovation in food and atmosphere. However, of course, prices have gone up to help pay for the cost of the renovation."}
{"text":"Saturday night, so nothing special on the menu.  We've been here before, several times; just seemed like the selection wasn't quite as good as before.  No specific raves or complaints.  Or maybe I was just tired."}
{"text":"So I was visiting the family for the holidays.I use to frequent the buffet at the Orleans and it was a good deal. I took my 7 year old daughter who eats like a bird. I went up to pay full price is charged for children ,that's ridiculous! I ponied up $30 for 1 and a quarter of us ok i bit the bullet and paid. So i guess the buffet was recently renovated great, too bad the choices and quality of food went way down. They use to have babyback ribs now they put out the cheap country style that are all fat. I tried some roastbeef,baked chicken nothing was great.We got in right before lunch closed so thought we could get something edible on the dinner .We waited a short while got up served ourselves and came back to a cleared table . A worker came up with attitude and said i would have to pay the extra $17 a head to have what's on the dinner menu. Unbelievable these greedy bastards no way that's worth $32 .They made it seem like I was a criminal stealing food,can't believe they kick people out .fuck this place now!"}
{"text":"i'm not a buffet person....and am very snobby about what i eat.  so with that said, i wasn't really able to find much that i would actually eat here.  

although i'm glad the french market buffet's conquistadors invaded a crawfish colony and massacred all its inhabitants, and probably kept some alive for breeding purposes to feed us gluttonous vegas patrons...because all you can eat crawfish made me feel like i ate my money's worth."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for dinner tonight and most things were done OK for a buffet.  However, two things caught my eye.  1)  Perogies larger than 2 raviolis combined and sitting in tomato sauce; and 2) Stuffed cabbage with a sweet raisin sauce.  Who on Earth ever added these tender morsels to the lineup? Certainly not a Top Chef contestant.  I didn't try either of these, but one member of our party tried the stuffed cabbage, but didn't know what it was.  He remarked as to how sweet it was.

I did try some of the red cabbage and that had been sugared too!  It doesn't need to be that way.  The rest of the things I tried were good especially, to my surprise, the Osso Buco."}
{"text":"We met friends here for dinner partly because we'd never been in the place since it opened several years ago.

While no longer a Station Casino, the buffet maintained some of the Red Rock Casino's layout and some of the items were identical to the buffet at Red Rock.  Probably the same supplier.

We were seated promptly.  The area to get your food is quite large and makes getting around people fairly easy.  I was most pleased with the pulled pork at the BBQ section.  The pork buns in the Asian section were good and they have a nice selection of gelato. The rest of the desserts were a bit lacking.

Refills of drinks and coffee at the end of the meal was very efficient.  I may be back when I'm looking for something different especially when I found out that Tuesday night, they have lechon."}
{"text":"Have ate here regularly when I stay at The Orleans.  A typical Vegas style buffet with five culinary stations including Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Mongolian BBQ, and Southwest BBQ. There is also two carving stations with the usual prime rib, ham, turkey or beef brisket.  Large salad bar with a few soup of the day options.  And desserts include many sugar free cakes and pies, gelato and cookies.  Good price for decent quality food."}
{"text":"Nice place to dinner with the family! The crawfish was awesome! The crepés are a must!!!"}
{"text":"Located inside the Orleans casino, the only reason I went was because I had a free comp. Asian, mexican, american, mongolian bbq are some of the varities of food available.

The quality and turn over of the buffets was so bad that I doubt I would go back even if I have another free comp. The best thing about dining here was that I got lucky at the craps table after dinner."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. The cashier was great but the server and supervisor was clueless. We received a comp and with that we were supposed to get (4) souvenir glasses. We told the waiter and he was so stupid that he gave it to another table. We heard the other table say \"oh why do we get this?\" So, at the end of our dinner we asked for our souvenir glasses and he said, oh no you don't get it. He was asking for the receipt that he took. He tried to argue and got his supervisor who was also clueless, so we had to go to cashier. Needless to say, we got our souvenir glasses. They just didn't seem to care. Also, we left our sun glasses by accident on the table and guess what....when we returned they said they couldn't find them. Hmmmm I wonder why? I know they stole them!!! I guess they needed it more"}
{"text":"Hometown Buffet a la Vegas. Pretty standard ordinary sub par food. It is $15 for Sunday which is pricey so definitely I wouldn't go back. I had ham, blintzes and cold shrimp with sauce."}
{"text":"They have improved over the years.  They are actually  one of my favorite places now.  The price is right and the food is good.  Sometimes the lines are super long so dont go when they initially open."}
{"text":"Whoever tweaked the recipes or cooking techniques at Medley...well done! 

The fam decided last minute to go to brunch at Medley before going to the movies yesterday at 1130 am and the line was long. 30mins later we were led to our table and Richard, one of my favorite servers brought our mimosas and champagnes. He kept it flowing while we were there so hubby was one happy customer..ha!

Everything I tried was really good. The roast beef was exceptionally tender, juicy and pink just the way I like it, their ribs were falling off the bone, fried mochies were yummy, the pork buns had more meat in them than usual and what's in that eggplant dish? Holy cow! It was so good I wished I had a waterproof/grease proof purse so I could dump a whole wokful of eggplant goodness in it. I am more of a menudo girl but their pozole was pretty good too. The guys at the omelette station on the Mexican side are always cool and friendly no matter how busy they get as well. The fried plantains are always good too. 

Between Red Rock's Feast Buffet and Aliante's Medley, I'll choose Medley any day."}
{"text":"If you have a coupon, this is one of the best deals in N. Las Vegas for sure.  We had 2 BOGOs from the LVA and had lunch for 4 for eleven bucks.  This buffet is not the Wynn of Caeser's but in my opinion it measures up to all of the other 3* and 4* buffets on the strip.  Meats were excellent and my wife enjoyed their little neck clams.  Very large selection with no lines, isn't that a breath of fresh air.  The Bananas Foster Gelato/Ice Cream may be the best I've ever had, worth the trip alone.  

I also like the clean air and relaxed vibe of the Aliante.   Customer service was outstanding at the buffet and throughout the casino!"}
{"text":"Wow!  After the remodel of this buffet late last year, I give it a nudge to a 4 star rating!

Look, I realize these buffets in Vegas are par for the course...so I go with what the buffet is doing to improve themselves, to make it a better experience.  With the newly named Medley Buffet at The Orleans, they seem to have gone all-out with a total makeover!  The old buffet is unnoticeable - new walls, new stations, new decor, new seating, new carpet...new everything!  Their buffet was due for a nice change, and it seems to be all the better for visitors new & old to Vegas.  I think many would be pleased with its new looks!

I'm not really gonna complain about the food either!  No, it's not really competing with the likes of Bacchanal or Wynn or Cosmo when it comes to really high-end buffets...but it gives many of the local player buffets a run for their money!  We went on their most expensive meal night (Friday's Steak & Shrimp is $25.99 per person) and had many selections to eat:

-Prime Rib
-Al Pastor Tacos
-BBQ Beef Ribs
-Shrimp & Pork Shumai
-NY Steak
-Assorted Meat & Cheese Platter
-Kalbi Ribs
-Fish & Chips
-Crepes

Overall, mostly good!  Some of the items were on the overdone side, like the NY steak.  Some were not flavored the way I prefer, like the Kalbi ribs.  The BBQ beef ribs are tasty but they do tend to get stuck in your teeth & get very messy!  The crepes were not my favorite - batter is a bit too thick and more pancake like.  But I give them an A for effort on those.

The station selections were varied and there are more offerings than ever before.  Choices people, choices!  So while you may not like everything you try, there must be something you can agree with!

For me, the best selection they had that night was a HUGE pot of Oxtails they brought out!  We Asians know!  The minute I saw those glistening oxtails I knew I had something special.  Right after I got my large bowl (OK 3 large bowls), all my Asian peeps followed suit.  One little Chinese lady actually came to our table and asked exactly where those oxtails were on the service line!  Popular to say the least!

Great experience at the all-new Medley Buffet with my family!  Good eats with good company always makes for a good time!

Don't forget your FREE B Connected players card when you visit the buffet, discounts galore depending on your player level.  

We'll be back Medley Buffet!"}
{"text":"On Veterans Day, we knew just about every buffet (especially Station Casinos) would be packed to the brim with folks!  Especially our deserving veterans, who all got to eat for FREE at a number of local buffets!  If I was a vet, I would have been livin' it up all day at the buffet...comped meals for breakfast, lunch, & dinner!  Eating = 100x better than gambling.

We decided to go to the farthest local buffet we could think of that may have a tinier crowd that day.  What a trek just to go to the Medley Buffet at Aliante!  Driving there alone on 215 makes it seem like you're going to another city.

The line at the Medley Buffet was hardly any different!  Even at a late lunch the line was still near full, lots of vets wearing their military hats or shirts, ready to eat with their IDs out!  It was a glorious site to behold - these folks fought for our freedom...and were now fighting beside us for the next open spot at the buffet!  Really it was a madhouse.  I can only imagine what the other more central buffets were doing.  Frickin' crazy.  Took us about 30 minutes to get to the front of the line, then a small wait for a table.  Luckily there were only 3 of us in our party so we didn't have to wait long.  Many tables had large families on them, all celebrating with at least 1 vet on them.  Man, Daddy how I miss you so!  Wish you were with us on this day to help celebrate what you did for the good ol' U S of A.  #armyvet

The lines for food at the buffet were constantly flowing with folks in and out.  I overheard one of the sous chefs who had been there since 5 AM prepping, that by the end of breakfast they had served over 1000 people already!  That in itself is a battle.  And it was only lunch time!

It was good to see vets enjoying time with their grateful families, but I do have to knock some stars for the quality of food at the Medley Buffet.  Come on guys, vets coming in, how about you up the ante, eh?  Put on that extra burner to give not just quantity, but some extra lovin' quality!  A lot of the food on the lines were short on TLC.  Some of it looked like it was made in a rush sloppily to satisfy hungry patrons.  Some of it just sat under the heat lamp too long (hello fish fillets) and took a beating.  And what is up with the Asian station?  It's like a half-hearted attempt to put some sorry looking stir-fry out.  Just mediocre.

For the most part I stayed away from the buffet stations that were getting the least attention by eaters - the Asian & the Italian.  Most of the foods there just looked like it sat too long, wasn't changed out in a timely manner.  Marinara sauce got a slight crust over the top?  PASS.

Majority of what I chose to eat came from the American station and the Mexican station.  Food seemed the freshest there because of the high foot traffic.  Things I like the most that day were the turkey (I got me an entire LEG), and the tacos with carnitas.  Those tacos were pretty tasty, I had like 8 of them!  For some reason I also grabbed a chicken nugget from the food line, and unfortunately the ones from McDonald's (even Wendy's) are better.

I passed on a lot of the other options available, desserts didn't appeal to me, nor did their salad bar.  Their BBQ station was a pass for me too, even though I thought about a 'fresh' grilled cheeseburger.  But as I watched one being made, why grill-maestro, why did you not put the buns on the grill with a pat of butter?  That is crucial for a great burger!  Ugh.

Service was good, and our server was very friendly even though she had a billion tables that day.  She fell behind on our drinks but made sure to apologize when she did come around for refills.  No knock on her for being super busy.  A vet takes precedence over my needs just about any day of the week.

Nicest thing I can say about the Medley Buffet at Aliante was the price.  Even for Veterans Day, price for entry was only $8.99 for lunch with the Aliante players card.  If you didn't have the card it was only $1 more.  Wallet friendly for sure.    

Will we be back?  Probably, but it may take some convincing or a BOGO FREE coupon to lure me back to Aliante.  In my opinion, it was much better when Aliante was still owned by Station Casinos and this used to be a Feast Buffet.  On the upside though, the slot machines may now be looser now than when Station Casinos was the owner, I won our buffet money back with the $7 I had leftover in my pocket!  Breaking even can sometimes be the greatest thing.

**Don't forget kids - VETERANS are one of the main reasons you & I can rant & rave on YELP today!!  #freedom  **"}
{"text":"Voted Best Buffet in Las Vegas... I see that advertising for everywhere in Vegas... Who decides what is the Best of Anything???

In this case, regardless of the billboards, I do. I believe this to be the Best Buffet in Vegas. I have eaten at several including the Rio and Bellagio. 

The French Market Buffet at the Orleans is a much better value than the others. On Friday's it is higher than other days, but being Catholic I appreciate that almost everything they serve at all the stations is seafood. 

For under $20 on Friday, I piled high plates with crab and shrimp. Had civeche, shrimp fajitas, fish, sushi, clam strips, oysters, a smorgasbord of seafood. Everything was delicious. 

There are also a ton of desserts to choose from."}
{"text":"First and last time in!
I've never had burnt crab legs before. Waited in line for an hour only to be told they were closing at 9:00pm. If we hadn't paid by then we wouldn't get in. At 8:53pm I paid for our buffet. Still didn't get seated until after 9:00. Then we were told that the food was being pulled at 9:30. 
Ok fine, we will grab a couple plates of what we want. 
At 9:40 we were told we needed to hurry up and finish because they were closing soon. Ok fine, I understand. The problem was in the delivery! The manager on duty telling the tables they needed to \"hurry up\" was ver rude and completely unprofessional. 10-15 minutes later she came back around and told us that and I quote \" It really is time for you to leave now. We are closed and you need to leave this room now\". 
Could not believe I was being spoken down to like that.
Food was mediocre at best. My crab was BURNT. Black and charred. Oysters were gritty like they weren't rinsed off enough before prepared. Mashed potatoes tasted like the instant stuff. 
Our server was nice and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday brunch, only $10.99 and they have a little bit of everything, I strongly recommend. Their hotel is always nice and clean and their machines are on the looser size. Over all this place is worth an early morning trip or early afternoon and a nice place to play, their movie theater and food court is nice too."}
{"text":"Service there sucks and the food is mediocre at best I wasn't expecting greatness just decent food.  Save yo dollas and go to some place else."}
{"text":"Excellent buffet for the price!  They have all sort of different foods to choose from, and not the long over crowded buffet like the ones on the strip.  Also sign up for there free B-Connect card and you get a discount on the buffet.  Well worth the trip and price."}
{"text":"Since they've done the redesign it seems their food menu was also redesigned. The selection has decreased but the quality has increased. We've gone several times four different meals and I can now say I'm happy with their breakfast! Someone finally learned how to cook scrambled eggs!! Salad bar is decent but it seems like they took out a lot of the other salad types to choose from. Steak options are good but they're always overcooked. I would suggest making them medium-rare and then grill a little longer for those who want thoroughly cooked meat, I prefer medium, the Mister likes medium rare - unfortunately we don't get that option here, it's either well-done or well-done. Dessert area is definitely lacking options, and flavor. Seems to be easier to get in these days though, as we haven't waited more than 10 minutes in line. It still could use a little more improvement in food quality/quantity, but a definite step up from where it was!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, very over priced for food out of a box.  Alfredo sauce tastes like milk. The black beans so old they were hard. Staff excellent at ignoring customers. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Medley buffet has been one of my go to buffets, I've been here for lunch and dinner but this is the first time I've done breakfast. Early in the morning night too many people, i was able to get my food rather quickly. I had a variety of food but the one thing i really enjoyed was the country fried stake. I don't know what i was expecting but i was somewhat disappointed with the variety, and the quality of food that was available for breakfast.

Overall not a bad experience but not the greatest either."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Love the cooked to order eggs, unlimited bacon, yummmmmmm bacon!!!! Always very clean and staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"This is, by far, my favorite buffet in all of Vegas Valley. There are a lot of things I really enjoy and the taste and temperature is very consistent. The shrimp scampi is a must if you aren't allergic to shrimp. The prime rib isn't the best, but it is still pretty yummy. Also, there is SUSHI. Which is actually fresh tasting and delicious. They only offer a few different rolls, but it is better quality sushi than you would expect.

The vegetable sides are really where this buffet stands out, in my opinion. Especially the roasted potatoes by the BBQ section, the Lyonnais potatoes in the Frenchy section, and the greens beans all the way down at the end in Italian/Asian.

It reminds me of back home in Texas. And I don't say that about much. The only thing lacking, which I would have expected to see in a New Orleans-themed place, was rolls of some kind. They had fantastic corn bread, but no good yeast rolls like you get down South."}
{"text":"Came here cuz my roommate and I had comps and wanted to try some place we hadn't been before. We heard some good things about this buffet and as a Boyd loyal player we decided to try this buffet , all I have to say was WOW! This place has totally stepped up their game !!! There was a huge variety of food from many different cultures , I was impressed by the many many carving stations and live action cooking stations , such as create your own pho, the made to order crepes and tacos !! The Chile verde is the bomb and if I get comps again heading here for that alone , it was that good !! Actually many of their pork dishes were great !! Also for the gluten free crowd the table menus give you a play by play of your gluten free options , I did post a pic !! All in all we left with a full belly and a happy disposition !! Only reason for 4 stars is that service was a little spotty starting out but our server did eventually come around and was there when we needed refills or a clean table !!"}
{"text":"Just made it before the end of breakfast at 10am. $7.99pp with the players card was a great, especially when paying for 8. Great selection and everything was well prepared. Good selection of American and Mexican. Even had good menudo.  They started bringing lunch out at 1030, so the big eaters in our group ate two meals in one sitting. Great value."}
{"text":"This review is based on lunch dining - I would've never though to go here, but it was a work stop, so here goes my review. 

It's $7.99 for lunch and it's quick, its food and whare more would you expect given those two things.  It doesn't compare to many of the strip buffets in terms of the quality of food, but I don't think it tries to.  

There is quite a large variety of options organized by cuisine.  I had a few things from the american and chinese section and a salad.  I did see pizza, pasta, potatos, fried chicken, meatloaf, mac-n-cheese, a mexican spread of tortillas and taco shells with the fixin's, and salmon that was actually pretty tasty!  There are quite a few dessert options to go with the many food options and there is hard scoop ice cream and I am a sucker for hard scoop ice cream!  The soft serve machine stuff doesn't cut it.  The coconut cream pie was probably the best tasting thing I had during my trip there, definitely recommend it. 

Btw, THERE IS NO ROMAINE - it's an iceberg lettuce kind of place, but that sums it up.  That should be the title of this review. :)"}
{"text":"A solid 3+.

We came on a seafood night (Friday) and it was packed.  The hostess/waitress was very helpful.

Plenty of shrimp, crab, and crawfish.

Liked their dessert; plenty dishes to choose from.  Price was reasonable.  $32 for dinner and on a holiday weekend."}
{"text":"If your points are paying for the meal then it's worth it but i wouldn't pay out of pocket. Good place to bring kids to fill up on whatever they need. You won't find the best cut of meat here. They do have a good asian and seafood station. They have a good breakfast selection in the AM. The waiters were good at bringing the drinks and getting plates off the table."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. You get $1 off up to two buffets with one player card. The prime rib was super rare, pork loin was dry. Peel and eat shrimp were good, but too much work. Desserts were pretty good, loved the chocolate cake and various gelatos. Service was basic, the table was dirty and server took forever to clear our stacked plates."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff don't see something you like? Ask!!, they\"ll make it for you! Or at lest they did for me. 
Didn't really do the all to you can eat just ate once and it's great for it's price. 
Came here 2 weekends in a row for the Viva rockabilly fest. Wasn't disappointing with the food ever. Really cheap and worth for what you get."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. The crab legs were over salted, and the oysters were questionable: both grey and dry. The pork ribs were tough, the salmon was over cooked and dry, and the watermelon tasteless. Sad to say it, but the best thing I had was the butterfly fried shrimp, and those probably came out of a box in the freezer. For the price, save some cash and go to Krazy Buffet. At $30 a head, color me unimpressed."}
{"text":"Cheap ($14.95 dinner) and good enough!  Everyone lived and had no emergencies eating here! :)

Didn't have to wait very long, once we paid we were seated right away and SUPER close to the food.  It was great!  Service was excellent!  Food was hot and from the amount of people there was a good turn of fresh food.  Nice layout too - spacious and  no rude people.  Keep Calm Get Buffet On! :)  

My favorite was the crab legs, crawdads, peel-n-eat shrimp, when given the right cut the baby back ribs were excellent and beef ribs were pretty cool too.  I had tiny bits of everything and didn't feel like those Wall-E floaty people!  Dessert was alright.  I did like the coffee ice cream.  Pumpkin - not so much. 

I'd go back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try a buffet while in Vegas. It was New Year's Eve, so we wanted to avoid the madness of the strip until that night. We were staying fairly close to the Orleans Casino and decided to give this place a try. Many buffets off-strip didn't seem to have great reviews, and this place seemed decent while remaining reasonable priced. I don't want to spend tons of money, as I can't eat enough to properly take advantage of a buffet.

We were quite happy with the offerings at this buffet. After paying, we were seated at a table and received excellent service for drink refills and bussing. I started with some BBQ, trying the pork links, biscuit and gravy, and jerk chicken. I also tried some french fries and fish filet from the seafood section. From an American food section, I had mac and cheese. From the Asian section, I had sweet and sour chicken, potstickers, egg rolls, and lo mein. I also had a salad from the salad bar and gelato, a mini pecan pie, and a mini piece of chocolate cake for dessert. There was another Asian-inspired section and a Mexican section as well, although I didn't try those.

I liked everything that I had, with the exception of the mac and cheese. It was dry and flavorless, although others in my group seemed to like it. The biscuit for the biscuit and gravy was extremely dry, but the gravy softened it, in addition to being tasty. The Asian foods were typical, Americanized offerings but had good flavor. Everything available looked appetizing, even if it wasn't my cup of tea. The salad bar was small, but I enjoyed the balsamic vinegarette and the topping options. The balsamic and oil and vinegar were the only dressing options that weren't a fattier, mayo-based option.

I wish I could have eaten more, but there was simply wasn't enough time for us to linger to have more helpings. If you're in the area and looking for a good buffet, I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time staying. And not too bad.

Pros: Room service is excellent. They go above and beyond to ensure food is delivered fresh, hot and to your specs. Lessie is the best! So ask for her by name! Tried both dinner, a Cobb salad and a cup of soup and breakfast, both were delicious. 

The rooms are clean! The staff does a very good job in restocking supplies, and ensuring the rooms are not only tidy but actually clean! That is a big deal it seems anymore, so bravo to the housekeeping staff.

There is a small arcade room near the movie theatre which is fun, not big but fun. 

The buffet is not to bad! The staff ensured we got a military discount without us even asking which was super nice. The scoped iced cream is a nice touch. And service was fast. 

I love the full service Starbucks! And the location is fantastic especially if you need to get to Nellis AFB and Creech AFB. 

Cons: The lights on the phones in the room. There are screens in the phones and are suppose to shut off and dim at night but ours lite up like the strip off and on all night. There was also some blinking green light under the desk that went off periodically as well. So, after doing damage control aka: taking towels and our clothes to cover all the lights up, we finally got an undisturbed nights sleep.

But the reading lights are nice as well as the picture lights that you can turn off and on.

I secretly wish all hotels would start upgrading mattresses to foam mattresses like a Casper.  The spring coils don't offer much super and the pillows are also too sloppy. It takes two to equal the support of one pillow.  Hint. Hint. Boyd.



We wish this was not a smoking casino. And there was a poker room."}
{"text":"Went to the breakfast buffet around 10am. There were only five people in line ahead of myself and my guest and we were seated quickly. I got the usual: bacon, scrambled eggs, and ham. My guest had eggs Benedict and granola and fruit-- didn't like the fruit or the terrible tasting Benedict. The bacon was very salty. The ham was a little salty, and the eggs were just ok. Service was ok. I will probably go back for dinner sometime. But the breakfast is not the best. I remember it being better, but not this day. The price was good with a players discount, came to $15 for two."}
{"text":"Great buffet for the price!  We ate here twice in the 4 days we were here."}
{"text":"Came to the Orleans Hotel with a roommate who scored free tickets to the Bill Maher show (He was hilarious)... decided on the buffet since the line wasn't long and none of the other restaurant options there seems interesting.

Being a native Las Vegan who was born here. I have not eaten at the Orleans Buffet since 1998 when I was 16.

That being said I was actually surprised by it.... the salad bar had nice crisp lettuce as well as all of the other options for your salad looking and tasting fresh and crisp as well. the salad plates were stone cold too which was a plus!

Of the options they had on the buffet line I didn't try any of the Mexican or Italian selections, I stuck mostly to the seafood area (They had a sign out that said due to unforeseen circumstances they would not have any craw fish, when I asked, the response was that they wouldn't have any for another week.) but the peel and eat shrimp were nice and plump and easy to get into and the Seafood Newburg and Cioppino were surprisingly good. 

The beef ribs were disappointing however as was the cut of prime rib. I also didn't like the Salisbury style steak that they had with a mushroom gravy, I went in at it with a fork thinking it'd cut right through it however the fork bounced back and almost took my eye out.

not much for seafood selection and as I said before the Mexican/Italian section didn't have anything that looked appetizing, the Mongolian section had SUSHI though which is kinda strange however the rice was pretty good and the fillings were decent for basic buffet sushi. 

TIP!: MAKE SURE YOU GET YOUR B-CONNECT CARD BEFORE PAYING!! (The regular price of the buffet is 14.95 without that card however it drops down to 9.99 after you get the card. 1 B-CONNECT card is good for two people to enter and the 5-10 minutes you'll use getting it is worth saving 5 bucks per person.

Overall it was not terribly bad however it wasn't amazingly good, but it'll make a turd."}
{"text":"This was our plan B when plan A was a bust (we checked out the menu at the oyster bar and the cafe, but majority ruled)- the McMullen's irish bar across the street was jam-packed, and there was a radio station there too (should've known it would be a hot spot since St. Paddy's fell on a weekend this year). (We'd been here years ago, but I think that it was seafood night.)

Since I had the baby, my system has gotten a little sensitive to certain dishes so I went the safe route and stuck to a few choice items: shrimp scampi- didn't really taste like it was supposed to but eatable (didn't get seconds), chicken gumbo (good considering the averageness of the buffet as a whole), peel 'n eat shrimp- who can mess this up, right?, mussels- a tad overdone but eatable, green beans- surpsingly a crispness to it, and not soggy, prime rib- good, once you cut out all the fatty parts (and there was a lot of it). There were salads, mexican, seafood, carving stations, asian including a mongolian feature, and pasta. 

I still find that some people get a little crazy when it comes to food, and that there will always be an impatient person right next to you or someone who wants to create their own line when there is already a clearly defined line started. The majority of the diners were good, except there were a couple kids playing and when there is a big crowd, that type of horseplay is not appropriate period.

An average Las Vegas casino buffet is the best way I can put this place, not the worst, not the best, just right smack-dab in the middle. To tell you the truth, the desserts ARE better than the food selections- there were No-Sugar selections as well, in addition to the pies- pumpkin and pecan, cakes- red velvet cake, slice of rolls- lemon or raspberry, cookies, macaroons, plus ice cream and gellato- about 9 flavors like cookies 'n cream, coffee (delish!!!), watermelon sorbet. Just steer clear of items like cake slices that were the obvious leftovers. I made the mistake of grabbing a red velvet slice, against my better judgement, and had to take off the entire side because it had hardened a bit- eww.

There was a lot of refilling of dishes going on by the workers, which meant there were a bunch of customers here. It was a good crowd for a saturday night. It wasn't too noisy, since our baby got to nap a bit. I also noticed a Hand Sanitizer station in between food stations, which you don't see a lot in a typical Vegas buffet. The drink server was good except she kept missing asking one person in our party. 

FYI- get the card so you don't feel like you just wasted your money; it's a few dollars cheaper when you \"get connected.\" $12.99 for saturday dinner."}
{"text":"I actually didn't finish anything that I attempted to eat. This Buffett had a little of everything which in the beginning was promising. I tried the enchiladas, bad choice bland and cold. Tried the egg rolls, took one bite and was done yuck. Tried the fried okra one of my favs. Tasted like it had been in the freezer along time before it was cooked. Tried the roast chicken and one bite was enough. Then I thought let's try desert, that can be bad. Have you ever had warm coconut cream pie? I have now."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food! 
In other countries, they charge a fee if you leave too much food 
It wouldn't be a bad idea to start charging people because some of them waste to much food"}
{"text":"If I could give the FMB 3.5 stars I would. However, because I think when it comes to buffets they are about as good as you can get in  regards to bang for your buck. The French Market Buffet along with the Garden Buffet at South Point are my two go to buffets for the price, especially when eating with the family. I will clarify though, we RARELY eat the buffet because it is not always worth it when you aren't meat eaters. That being said - the French Market provides more veggie options than many other higher priced buffets at similar casinos, and they have a lot more seasonal fresh fruit than some strip buffets. 
We happened to go for dinner on Saturday after seeing a movie. It was about  6pm, there was no line, and we paid about $30 (including tip) which is about the same as we'd pay at another restaurant. I usually stick to Chinese and Mexican with the addition of fruit and veggies, and this night was no different. Everything seemed pretty fresh,  except for some roasted potatoes. The fruit (mostly melons) was fresh and juicy. As always the desserts were good.I think the secret to buffets is as Anton mentions - eat in courses. That is definitely the way.  What you really must know about this buffet, and any of the non-strip buffets is that the food is not the best you'd find, but not bad at all. Don't expect the best Vegas chef's but you will get a meal here that rivals the restaurants in this and other local casinos. 
On this particular occasion our service sucked, but that really was the worst we'd ever had at the this buffet. Since we don't eat the buffets often, it probably won't be until we have family in town to go back, but they are always satisfied, and so are we."}
{"text":"This is the buffet option in the Orleans Casino.  We had lunch there with a reunion group and were well served in a separate room.   The food options were extensive, if not terribly exciting....other than the dessert bar which was nearly overwhelming in variety of cakes, pies, fruit, gelato and even no-sugar-added caramel gelato.  Other reviewers note the different ethnic cuisine bars, but the Mongolian area offered bacon, eggs and other breakfast items at 11 am. 
 Price was under $10 with the free \"B-card\" offered by the hotel/casino chain (available on the casino floor.)   Slightly higher in the evening, but prime rib is included.   (BTW prime ribs seems to the the mascot meat in LV)  Considerably better and nicer ambiance than the usual Golden Corral or other buffet at a very reasonable price"}
{"text":"Came for the LECHON on Tuesdays make sure you get a players card for your discount. The review is only for lechon. As soon as we turned into the parking lot we could smell the lechon! Our windows were rolled up our mouths we already watering before we took our seat belts off! 
The lechon was delicious! We arrived around 7 there was a short line to pay for the buffet, and a short line for the pig, they even had mang Thomas the Filipino dipping sauce the pig was nice a moist and the skin exactly how it should be crunchy!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  We went there to get the Buffett and no one was there to greet you , when someone did come up they were like we're closed and walked away. Another worked came out from the back and stated they are closing at 8 pm Mon to Thursday now.   No notice on that either"}
{"text":"Cost considered, this place is a great bang for your buck.  Food tastes good,  surprisingly the coffee is high quality."}
{"text":"Not as good of some of the high end buffets in Vegas, but the price and food are decent. You get to sample various different types of cuisine (American, Chinese, Italian, Japanese, Creole/Soul, etc.), and although it's not the best, you will eat well. My favorite was the desert bar which had so many options, it was hard to make a decision. The desert bar even serves Gelato hand scooped by a server : ) 

 One thing that turned me off was seeing children put their fingers in the chocolate fountain, while their parents were standing right there! 
 If you are in search of an off \"The Strip\" buffet on a budget, this is your answer. Just don't eat from the chocolate fountain ; )"}
{"text":"This is not your grandmother's buffet!  We went on a very crowded Friday night to the all you can eat snow crab leg and seafood buffet!  Surprisingly, we were seated quickly. I was impressed with the fresh and tasty food.  They even had great sushi.  The variety of food was amazing, everything seafood you could ever want!  And they still had some staples like mac & cheese and hot dogs for the kids.  The desserts were delicious and very appealing!  Highly recommend this buffet!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite buffet restaurant so far. Some of people in front is friendly , other is not. Most waitress is good and friendly. We have to wait less than 10 minutes for the seat. It's not too bad. The food is okay. I like the crawfish here. Others are normal, nothing is special. $26 for special on Friday. For me, dinner is better than breakfast."}
{"text":"The first thing to know is that this buffet is super cheap -- which is awesome. I've tried just about every hotel's buffet and sub-$15 blows my mind. Food is separated by types of cuisine and they actually have a seafood section with piles of shrimp. Quality is okay, you basically get what you pay for.

There's also endless gelato. Some foods I liked included the ribs, potatoes, roast chicken, shrimp, and pastas. 

This is the kind of buffet you take someone who isn't a picky eater or someone who you don't like too much but eats a lot -- or both. Great place if you're forced to pick up the tab."}
{"text":"For the price this is a good buffet.  Everybody is friendly and the overall quality is good. They have several stations so the selection is good for enough to make my family happy."}
{"text":"You will find a couple items you like here, but overall, this is only a buffet I would  go to if I was staying at the hotel and did not feel like heading out to a better one because it's pretty basic.  I found a couple items I enjoyed, namely this Hawaiian shredded pork dish.  But the salad bar is sad, no bread to speak of.  For the price, it's not bad, but it is worth spending more to experience better quality and selection.  Would have gotten a 2, but I recall they surprised me with a pretty good dessert item at the end."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Orleans for several days this past weekend and the French Market Buffet was a staple of my diet while here. Hey, I'm Chinese (or at least half)- you say \"all you can eat\" and I'm runnin'!

The breakfast is economical at about $7.50 (okay, I don't remember exactly, but it was more than $7 but less than $8). Compare that to a menu breakfast at Denny's or the like only you can come back for seconds!

Saturday night was my favorite night because they featured prime rib! They have two stations, one for medium rare and one for medium well. The rare is juicy and buttery! Mmmmm!! For seconds I went for assorted jumbalaya, seafood and crawfish which are regular dishes.

I was getting pretty full and felt it was time for dessert. I got up and came back with another helping of rare prime rib!

I think I'm going to be eating a bag of salad everyday for lunch for the next week or so...."}
{"text":"Want crab for Easter? lol don't come here. Each leg was cut into 1/4s. I don't know if they're trying to save money, but don't overcharge the buffet for a \"Crab special\" and then pull that crap."}
{"text":"Great foods specially the crab legs, the price is reasonable, if you go there on Friday you gets 5 bucks off the buffet."}
{"text":"Decent buffet for the price.  Crawfish, shrimp, deserts could use improvement. Wait staff was very good.  Line took 30 min to get in with empty tables inside. Salads, shrimp and meats were all very good as well. The Oyster Bar in The Orleans is fantastic."}
{"text":"Rarely eat at buffets but we were seeing movie so seemed a good place for lunch. The wait to get in was awful. We could see plenty of empty tables and people leaving but they did not have enough staff. Food was so-so. Key lime pie and their gelato very good. Wouldn't do it again."}
{"text":"I am sorry to give two star to Buffet, food is really not so good, dishes are cold, food is blend and without flavor . Desert bar is much better, they deserve four stars at least. On the other hand costumer service is flawless . They truly deserve five star.  I had some issues with a food, they took care everything in very professional way. Security took my report very seriously, buser( Tony)  was on the point, server nice and manager Ana sweetest person I ever met in my life. Thank you for taking care me and give me feeling that I am special guest not just number. Hopefully next time food is going to be better and warmer but I wish service stay always so good and nice."}
{"text":"this is a cheaper version of bellagio, if you ask me.  The food is good, and though their dessert selection is average, it definitely exceeds my expectations based on their price.  Though i dont like it, my parents always get plates and plates of craw fish...no thanks.  i like the variety and especially the price.  were were lucky enough to grab a bunch of $5 coupons and ended up paying $8 for the meal per person....but yeah..if youre on a budget, and want to eat at a buffet, skip the rio because this is the place to go.  one of my favs!"}
{"text":"We visited Medley Buffet while staying at The Orleans Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. We were given a Buy 1 Get 1 Comp on our gaming cards. This buffet runs $21 p/p & $32 p/p on Sunday's. John said it must be good. Let's try it. This buffet represented all ethnic cuisines. I know the stations took up a 1/2 mile. Not making this up. Full Salad Bar, Asian, Hawaiian, Italian, Mexican, American, Japanese and so forth. All had a menu option. The dessert bar was topped with fresh baked cookies, pies, cake slices and ice cream. I can see why they charge so much. The servers were attentive and helpful. They asked us about our stay and genuinely wanted to wait on us.  We will visit again soon."}
{"text":"Arrived at 9.45am for the breakfast buffet only to be told by the hostess that the food would be pulled at 10.30am and everyone had to vacate the restaurant before 11am.  Turns out over 50% of the food was yanked by 10.10am and many containers of food were already empty.

The food is inline with Station casino food. Plenty to choose from but not many healthy options, lots of fake/toxic food additives/flavors and you won't remember eating it a couple of hours later.

Surprisingly, the coffee was exceptionally good.

Our Server Elsa was top knotch. We poached her as our original Server Peggy couldn't be bothered showing up for 15 minutes and the place was not busy."}
{"text":"As far as buffets go in Vegas, who rules the roost? Not Medley Buffet at Aliante, but for those living in the North/Northwest side of town - it will do.

My husband, myself, and my brother trekked here on Christmas Day for dinner. We arrived at about 1:30 PM, which I think was the \"sweet spot\" because there was only a few others in line ahead of us, and when we were seated, there were no other patrons around us. However, as we got through our meal it got crowded real fast.

This buffet offers the \"norm\" - meat carving station (props on the very succulent and juicy turkey, probably my fave of everything), and the prime rib was nothing to turn your nose up at. The ham though fell flat and dry. Other \"traditional offerings\" included stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, green bean casserole.

Other sections of the buffet include: Asian, Mexican, and Desserts. It's not the greatest selection, nor is it the worst.

Aliante has been broken away from Stations Casinos for a couple years, so don't expect to be able to use your Station Card to get a discount here, you have to sign up to Aliante's players club. However, since it was Christmas, the kind cashier charged my family the players club price anyway. Per usual this is a good deal taking about $3-$4 off the norm price.

I was happy to not have to cook or clean dishes after a big meal. Only downside is, we have no leftovers! Oh well."}
{"text":"For $12 for 2 people price wasn't bad but the food was bland.  Breakfast buffet is better."}
{"text":"Our waitress was attentive and kept our drinks  filled  and table clear of dirty dishes. Brunch Buffett was the typical stations with breakfast, international stations, carving station and omelette made to order. I was surprised at the freshness of the fried chicken. It was still moist and skin crunchy. The carving station was a disappointment. To save time they precarved some of the meat so it looked dry and unappealing.  Had to wait for the attendant to ask for a fresh slice.  Wife loved the ice cream selections and the soft serve. It wasnt top tier like the strip but for what i paid it was good."}
{"text":"Can't say much about lunch but definitely come here for breakfast.
My friends and I came here for lunch and was not impressed but received a $2 off coupon for breakfast. So the next morning we came and ate breakfast at about $4 a person. Only in Vegas can you find prices like these for the food you get. The breakfast is a fat kid's dream come true complete with pancakes, waffles, desserts, you name it. 
By the way if you go a little later say around 10:15 you get to start off eating breakfast and end the meal with a little bit of lunch (spoken like a true fatass).
When we got there breakfast was being served but they changed everything into the lunch menu not too long later.

This place makes losing money in Vegas worthwhile. And this is why I love Vegas. People think I come here to gamble but I secretly come because of the food."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for Thanksgiving and looking for a reasonably priced buffet with good food.  We were close to the Orleans so we went to their French Market Buffet. After a 40 min wait (not bad for Thanksgiving at 1pm) we got a table and it was really, really good for the most part.  

The traditional Thanksgiving fare was not that great.  I didn't like the way they did the yams at all.  My husband thought the dressing was ok but I didn't.  The turkey breast was delicious but the dark meat was pressed in a loaf and slice, my husband didn't like it much.  

However the other food was awesome!  Seafood Newburg, Jambalaya, Crab Stuffed Salmon from the seafood section.  Hubby had a plate of Mongolian BBQ that he loved.  The Steak with Peppers from the Asian area was faboo, tender and delicious!  There was also some Veal Osso Bucco.  It was new to me but really good.  

The dessert area was also wonderful with a LOT of variety.  Strawberry Shortcake and Cheesecake were our favs."}
{"text":"This is my favorite buffet in Vegas.  Cheap, No Lines and all you can eat Crawfish.  Has almost the same selection of food as the Rio Buffet and you'll never find a line here.  The desserts are delicious too, plenty of southern favorites.  But yeah I cant say enough about the all you can eat crawfish.  You pile a plate full of crayfish, clean them, eat them, and go back for more.  So remember this place if your in Vegas and its lunch time and you dont want to wait in a long line to eat.  Oh yeah did I say they had crayfish?"}
{"text":"The best spot for getting your grub in vegas, especially if your on a budget. Can't complain, all you can eat crawfish + only $11 for dinner. This isn't some fancy fusion bellagio $50 buffet, this is just good simple affordable food. Been here many times with family, many of the locals go here too. Compared to the price of other buffets, can't complain, service is always average and better. When you spent all your cash on clubs, crap tables, and your drunk off your a$$ this hits the spot."}
{"text":"Every Christmas season a club my husband belongs to, which shall remain nameless to protect the dorky, has their Holiday \"party\" at a different buffet.  I say \"party\" because this group eats and runs.  Luckily, we were at a separate table with two couples who stayed a while, so it was a pleasant experience. This year's buffet was at French Market at Orleans.  I was dragged, kicking and screaming.  I'm not a fan of buffets unless they're 5 Star Yelp quality, otherwise why bother?  I don't particularly like stuffing my face just because the food's there.  

We went on Friday night, which is Seafood night.  I like seafood, but don't love it, so right there my review has to lose a star - or two.  I waited patiently by the crab legs while the Great Unfed loaded up their plates to overflowing, then took my two crab legs.  I promptly gave myself a deep puncture wound trying to wrestle the crabmeat out of the shell.  I DON'T LIKE TO WORK FOR MY FOOD!!  I was happy to discover that the crab wasn't as briny as the last time I tried it, but it wasn't full of flavor, either.  I don't do oysters, so I skipped that part, and the peel-it shrimp wasn't anything to write home about.  I did like the baked salmon and the osso bucco.

The desserts were typical - looked great, tasted not so, except for one chocolate-covered thingy that had a decent chocolate mousse inside.  And the soft-serve ice cream is ice cream, not froyo at some other buffets.  That was pretty good.  I don't like pie, but I'll give this buffet a 3 .1415."}
{"text":"I really liked this buffet inside the Orleans Casino. I like that they have a huge variety, large seating, good prices, and good schedule. Next time we're there I want to try their Sunday Brunch. So if you're staying at the Orleans, the Buffet is a MUST."}
{"text":"Me , my cousin and sister in law came here to eat brunch during the brief time I was able to pull them away from the strip. The buffet was like all the others with an Asian, Barbecue, Italian and dessert station. Some of the things that stood out was at their salad bar they served grilled veggies. They had asparagus and grilled zucchini. The taste was nice and sweet. 

They also serve southern food like grits , and Jambalaya. I tried the grits because I remember liking them so much when I ate some at Rosemary's restaurant but it wasn't quite the same. I did have fried scallops and mini crab cakes which were really good with a spritz of lemon. I also had chicken fried steak but it tasted plain to me because I usually eat it with a side of honey mustard. It's different ... but it tastes good! Unfortunately they had no honey mustard salad dressing. 

My second plate I thought I 'd try their chocolate waffles. If you like soft waffles don't eat these they had the consistency of toast. I also grabbed some scallop mixture they had cradled in a shell it's not as tasty as the ones at Asia buffet. I would pass these up.I also tried a cheese blintze but I could only take a bite the cheese inside was all crumbly. 

My dessert plate was my favorite because they had this almond crumb cake that had drizzled raspberry sauce in it. They used to serve this at Red Rock casino but I haven't seen it there in a while. It was so good with tea,. They also had Tiramisu cups which were really tasty the cake part wasn't too wet it was just right! 

The most amazing part of the meal was my cousin saying this was her favorite Las Vegas Buffet . I wasn't sure I heard her right but she said this was by far her favorite. I was like ...uh okay. I'm just happy she liked it so it was a win..win situation!"}
{"text":"For $13.99 is OK for a buffet. The food was decent but everything tasted too salty even the fried catfish(?). The best part of this buffet is the crawfish. You can get a huge plate of them unlike some other buffets. A pound or two of them is worth the price. Service was slow but we ordered extra drinks early and they accommodated that with out trouble."}
{"text":"We ended up at the Medley Buffet inside The Orleans because we were uninterested in the food court options they had. We had been here several years ago, and were not particularly amazed with the food-and even had a sushi food poisoning incident. However, with the recent remodel of the buffet, it seems they have really improved!The selection isn't huge, but is still pretty decent, so you are sure to find something you'll enjoy. 

It was really refreshing to see that hey had completely renovated the buffet, from the decor, the flooring, the chandeliers, everything appeared clean and looked beautiful! When we were here a couple years ago, the decor was very dated but we were happy to see that the place had really opened up, was bright, and overall a major improvement from our last visit. 

We had no problems with the service, all of the waiters were extremely friendly, and we were checked on numerous times. Our waiters were quick to bring us refills and clear plates off our table. She also made me custom iced coffee (not on the menu!) which was so nice of her.  

The food quality-having been to numerous AYCE buffets in Vegas has really improved since our visit years back. On this particular visit this past weekend, there were two standout dishes for me: the pesto tortellini, and the al pastor tacos! Pesto tortellini is one of my all time favorite Italian dishes, so to see it as one of the dishes in the Italian section was a big surprise, and it did not disappoint! The pasta was creamy, the cheese-stuffed tortellini was sooo delicious, and the pesto was not overwhelming, and tasted fresh! The al pastor tacos were such a pleasant surprise!! We are Southern California natives so everyone in my party was super excited, and they were DELICIOUS. The quality of meat was fantastic, and the salsa gave an amazing kick. We also saw the al pastor being cooked traditionally on the stick, and carved fresh-so amazing! They also renovated their dessert bar, and I'm so happy that they added gelato- my AYCE Vegas buffet trips are not complete without it! 

So happy with the remodel and improvements! I would recommend this buffet to anyone as they are really beginning to stack up to the higher end buffets located on the strip. Their selection is smaller but very unique. Very happy with the service and left very satisfied!"}
{"text":"I will make sure to never return to this buffet again. After the way our group was treated by Nickey I was disgusted. She was very rude and came off argumentative from the beginning. Hopefully someone from management will see this and help her to change her attitude."}
{"text":"One of the better buffets in Vegas. Price is very good. Sign up for there rewards card and save money. They also send coupons in the mail."}
{"text":"employees are always nice, but went last week on a Saturday brunch (not thinking) and it was 17$ a person even with our members card, there was nothing special about the food, nothing new, same stuff, same taste as going on a wed. afternoon and paying less. way overpriced sat"}
{"text":"Our first time back since they remodeled the buffet. Don't believe any poor reviews this place is fabulous. The food was great and their are so many choices. The facility is new fresh and sleek. 
The shrimp was excellent as was the prime rib and New York strip steak. They had craw fish which every one loved. So many choices you can't go wrong. 
The desert area was great. Ice cream ,sherbet and gelato. Cakes pies cookies and more. The staff is excellent but get their early because the line is long"}
{"text":"The remodel is the best thing to happen to this place. Since the remodel the place has looked more modern. The food has followed with the remodel with the quality of food going up. The food is now superior quality then other Vegas buffers around the same price. I would highly recommend this Medley Buffet."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have visited this buffet twice now in the past few days. Once for lunch and once for dinner (the Tuesday night Pig Roast). Both buffets seemed to have the exact same selection except for adding the pig roast for dinner. I believe lunch was $9.99 and dinner was just a few dollars more. But if you get a rewards card, you get. Couple bucks off. I feel the quality and selection were pretty great for the price! I particularly enjoyed the taco station where I could load up on guac and sour cream. Hubby seemed to really enjoy all the Asian food. And mom loved the selection of ice cream - both soft serve and scooped were available with a bunch of fun toppings. 

Service on both visits were pleasant and attentive. I know we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had never been to the Orleans.  But my parents were in town and I agreed to meet them out in Vegas for Christmas.  Since they were staying there, we thought it would be great to try a different buffet.  They usually stay at the California and we always eat at the Main Street Station buffet.  The French Market is good...very good.

What I really like is the variety!  I tried a little of almost everything, but of the stuff that I like.  Yes, I managed to do three plates and a couple desserts.  The staff is very friendly which is great!  The woman who took care of us even joked around with me.

She: I forgot your mom's tea bags...they are on my station, can you go and get them?
Me: Oh, okay...(as I start getting up)
She: I'm just playing....I'll be right back

I was actually going to go and get them!

I wouldn't say that this buffet just knocked me off my feet (I have yet to find that one), but the food offerings are fresh, tasty, and plentiful.  I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Came here at 9am for the breakfast buffet on a Monday morning. The line looked long but it moved very fast.

The buffet has all the breakfast basics: eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. The price was fair at $8.99, but you get a discount depending on level of players card.

Highlights: 
1) The Omelet guy- he was making five at a time. There was hardly any wait time. In addition, the ingredients are laid out like a Mongolian BBQ station. I liked being able to choose how meaty I wanted my omelet. I piled up bacon, sausage, mushrooms, spinach, and had him top it with jack cheese. 

2) One of the trays had spam. Being Asian, this was a plus for me since I had it with fried rice.

Minus one star because the server took a while for the drinks and rarely checked on us. Other than that, it was a great value for the price."}
{"text":"Whoever says this place has good food has obviously had their taste buds surgically removed or ones that are accustomed to the creations Chef Boyardee and Hot Pockets. 

Your options are:

*Pasta 
*Mexican (The guacamole is made from a powdered mix)
*USA (Proof that Americans don't eat anything original)
*Chinese (Hello, MSG)
*Salad Bar (Wilted lettuce leaves and sopping mayo bean/pasta salads)
*Seafood (Cocktail shrimp, crawfish, and tuna doused in cream sauce)
*Carcass (All the dried up meat carcass you desire)
*Diabetes (All the \"ice cream\" you want, and grocery store cakes you can shove down)
*Slops 

Our server was incredibly sweet despite his sh*thole occupation of hauling away plates of half-eaten \"food\" and was prompt in delivering drinks.  But honestly, you're better off people-watching here than actually consuming anything."}
{"text":"The ratio of walkers to wheelchairs here is rather high.  That's not say that I'm against either.  Just that, I felt as if I was visiting my grandparents in their assisted-living home's restaurant.  

The lasagna tasted like the best Chef Boy-Ar-Dee's I've ever had.  

The cheese enchiladas were great until you tried the second one and realized that it's almost all sauce and the enchilada themselves have no true shape.  Rather, it's just a coagulated gelatinous glob of cheese and something that tries to be a sauce of some sort.  

The shrimp are small and have all of their little shrimp feet intact.  If you enjoy using your napkin to often wipe the taste of the sad misery of the ocean floor off your fingers, this place is for you.

The top portion of the bread pudding tastes like bread pudding.  About a half inch down, though, it turns to jelly.  Jelly fused with a raisin or two.  Be sure to add lots of the vanilla sauce to mask the true flavor of this delicacy.

All of this for nearly $40.  

Next time, I'll just skip a meal and weep quietly in darkness - that actually sounds like it might leave a better taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I don't typically do buffets...but this one did it right!!! Everything was prepared well with quality ingredients. The service was fast and friendly.  The price was nominal for what you got..I think it it was like $13 for dinner...I would DEFINITELY go back if I wasn't sure what I was craving and needed a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Breakfast food is my fav, and I come here for it. They have all the fixins and more. Never had a problem or bad food when I came here. It's a nice little local spot. $6 for all u can eat breakfast with players card. I'd come here every morning if I could."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. No way I'd ever go here to spend $45 on my wife and I again. I'd sooner go to Golden Corral or just about any other restaurant in Las Vegas. The fried chicken was dry and difficult to chew. The best desert was the ice cream, although the lady behind the counter was pretty rude. Their saving grace was that their steak was cooked pretty well but was bland and they had no A1 and the sauces they did have were disgusting. Especially their honey bourbon barbecue sauce tasted like it was 90% alcohol. I'm not usually a picky person but if I'm going to spend $22.50 a person the food has to be better than that."}
{"text":"Lunch was $10.99 and includes a beverage. After 3:00 they start packing up the food and my waitress was busy cleaning and stopped bringing drinks, so it's best to get there before 2:00. The food was great, the price was alright."}
{"text":"This buffet has great ambiance and friendly staff and server! Came in for lunch.

Food are organized by category ( BBQ, Italian, Asian, American, TexMex, Desserts, and Pastries)

Breakdown for each category:

BBQ: their cornbread and hushpuppies were really delicious! Their collard greens were too salty for me to enjoy.

Asian: They served wonton chips, Pork buns (has a soft bread and right amount of pork filling), sesame balls (little hard but the purple filling taste like any other sesame ball), Tofu (love the sauce!), and brocolli stir fry.

Italian: must try the cheese raviolli! (Especially the sauce!! Load up on it!), the pizzas were average, the alfredo was creamy and just right!

American: had baked yams, baked potatoes, waffles, chicken among others. Didnt get try this section.

Texmex: they served taquitos, tacos (which you can customize!), posoles (yum!!), and their rice has exactly the right amount of flavor! Not salty but very flavorful! 

Desserts & Pastries: had many different pies such as coconut creme pie with coconut shavings on top, blueberry pie (it tastes okay, not sweet which I prefer!), and lemon pie among others. They also served donuts, donut holes, danish (had a black filling--not sure what it was but it wasnt the best, it could have used more filling),  creme puffs, mini desserts like chocolate mousse with a graham bottom layer and strawberry mousse), peach and apple cobbler, and this one pudding next to the cobbler that taste very delicious, its mushy but really good!  Had different flavors of ice creams too! Not just the typical vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.

Overall, I loved this place! Finished my meal with s black tea!"}
{"text":"Can't make this sh$$ up. What else do I need to say...? Just look at the picture and laugh with me"}
{"text":"2.5 is a more appropriate rating.  We haven't visited this buffet in a number of years due to past quality/turnover issues, but we decided to give another try after I won two free buffets.  Most of the buffet employees were dressed in Halloween garb and they seemed to be in a particularly cheery mood.  Also, the buffet was very busy which no doubt had a positive impact on turnover.  I had my usual huevos rancheros, fruit and OJ.  The quality and variety of the food was a notch above those at both the South Point, Sunset Staion, Aliante and Gold Coast on this trip."}
{"text":"This is what my mom and I like to call the budget buffet.

Cheap to chow...and the food is relatively tasty.  

The food isn't of the same quality as let's say the buffet at the MGM, but the price is about half.  The food here isn't as bland and tasteless as many other buffets either.  I would eat here before eating at RIO again!

I am giving it 3 stars for the food and selection, plus a bonus star for the price."}
{"text":"Our server was Chow.  l loved his service if I could give him 10 stars I would  I will be coming back.  His manager was Ana.  Thank you both wonderful job."}
{"text":"Decent prime rib buffet for the price. Food quality is better than some of the other buffets in this price range. The place was very busy around 8 pm on a weeknight. Oddly, I really liked the sushi - shrimp tempura and various CA rolls. And the prime rib was good too. Southern food was good - collard greens, black-eye peas, etc. Salad bar wasn't the best - iceburg lettuce mix and not many toppers. Large variety of desserts but none were great.  

Server was great - very attentive and friendly.

My only complaint is that the hosts took a long time to seat people and did not prioritize those in the handicap line. And they were not super friendly."}
{"text":"Recent upgrade ( place looks nice ) with usual consequence of price hike and less people. We came because of our 2 for 1 coupon. Great selections for those who love Asian food ( which I do ). Their brisket was tender but the flavor was bland- needs some salt and some spice. Love the omelette station btw. Cashier told us they stopped their seafood night because of lack of guests and our server told us they have been cutting servers hours because of lack of business. Are we coming back? Not without a 2 for 1 coupon. I told our server South Point has the best food out of all our local casinos and only costs $10. I bet if they charge $10-11, they would see more traffic. Not everything is about the ambience, buffet is all about food and price."}
{"text":"I don't honestly see what all the hype is about this place. I went after seeing numerous reviews in the past few weeks about how great this place is, how great the food is, how excellent the service is... 

The best part of the buffet... new york strip steak, onion rings and some beef lasagna. 

Other than that the food was mediocre at best, the desserts were kinda junky tasting and dry, and the service was very slow/rude. Our server was quite ornery and took almost 10 minutes to get steak knives for us after being asked. Never showed up with A1 sauce either. (She told us after the 10 mins and bringing back 1 knife... not 2...that she couldn't find any steak sauce.) 

The guy who was supposed to be carving the chicken/prime rib at the station wandered off for over 5 minutes, and there was quite a few people standing there waiting for service behind me... I was about ready to cut the bloody meat myself for everyone else who was waiting.

So while the three foods I listed earlier were worth 5 stars (The new york steak is only on thursday) the rest of the service and food was only worth 1 or less. 

Tragic..."}
{"text":"This place is decent for a buffet, it's your typical buffet. The Aliante Hotel is right around the corner from family. We went here for their Saturday Steak Dinner (the day after xmas) and the next day for their breakfast. 

Saturday was about $18.95 normally or about $15.95 with a players card. One players card works for up to 4 people. Sunday's breakfast was about $8 normally or $5.95 with a players card. You cannot beat the price, but again you aren't paying for anything spectacular. 

Saturday had lots of meat. I don't eat meat, but there were options for me. The best part was their dessert. Delicious bananas foster ice cream and pies. Their mexican station was pretty good, as was their Asian. 

Sunday they had an omelet bar and all the sides. They also had donuts! 

I wouldn't drive out here JUST for the buffet, but if you're local and in the area you can't beat the price or the variety of food."}
{"text":"Was a regular before this up grade?  Now they have it looking more upscale but very limited for handicap access. Most accessible tables are to the far end from the food.  Getting around the tables in wheelchairs is difficult.  The lack of signage means diners wandering around to see what is where.  This must increase the dining time per patron considerably.  The food on my two visits was fair at best. Many items over cooked, dry and hard. A definite step down from the old buffet in all regards. Management was seen to be non receptive to a patrons complaint I observed and was borderline rude to her.  The upside is the table servers who really have to hustle."}
{"text":"Yikes! The Orleans Casino and Boyd spent 4.5 million dollars completely renovating the buffet, changing the name, layout and everything. I was super excited when I got a coupon for 2 free buffets and couldn't wait to give their new buffet a try.

Lets just say I'm glad I didn't pay for this. 

On my first plate I tried their cheese enchilada (because how in the heck can you mess that up), rice and a few pieces of sushi. The sushi was inedible, falling apart, dry and fishy. The enchilada was over-cooked, falling apart and to say it was salty would be understating the salinity of this abomination. The rice, surprisingly crunchy.

I had literally one bite of everything and ditched the plate. I thought for sure our server was going to kick me out or something for throwing out an entire plate of food, but thankfully he didn't say anything.

Round 2: I tried the steak, a salad, some chow mein, and cheese ravioli with marinara. 

So I ended up eating the salad for dinner (the rest was inedible). 

Dessert was bland. Also, like every other casino in Vegas, they have those cute little desserts in the clear cups, and small tarts.... unlike other casinos, they put these tarts behind glass and you have to ask for the ones you want. So weird... you just know they're going to shame you if you ask to try 3 or 4 different tarts.

One guy reviewed the Aliante's buffet and said that if you wanted to know what the color beige tastes like you should eat there. EXACTLY! If you want to know what the color beige tastes like-- this is your jam. I would have been really upset had I actually paid the $43 for 2 buffets. 

Pros: The place is gorgeous, new, and modern.
Cons: The food is terrible."}
{"text":"Instead of charging you based upon a child's age, they charge you based upon a child's height (42 inches and under are free).  Join the \"B Connected\" club and save $2.00 on your meal.  Ok, on to the review:

This place is great!  I dined with my wife and two children here for breakfast.  They have all the standard stuff: eggs, bacon, hash browns, pancakes, waffles, etc.  The cool thing is they have two omelette bars, which really helps the lines move, and ensures you get one, if you really want one. 

The Mexican breakfast section was REALLY good.  I could eat the Chile Verde all day (which is probably why they put a two hour time limit on buffet purchases).

The wait staff was very courteous.  You don't get drinks at a drink station or anything, they bring you all the drinks you want/need.

By booking a room at the Orleans, I got a $20 dining credit, which I used to pay for our group's breakfast.  Since one of my children was under 42 inches, and by joining the \"B Connected\" club, I only paid a few bucks for our breakfast!!!!!  This brought back memories of the \"old days\", when buffets were SUPER cheap in this town."}
{"text":"Went during lunch time. Wait was long to pay, and then another long wait to be seated. Food was average, there are better buffets to choose from if you are willing to pay a couple of extra bucks.  For the price, you get what you pay for.  Waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"Great deal and great food. Especially breakfast. Its not the fanciest place. But i come here everytime i'm in LV."}
{"text":"Went to the newly renovated Medley Buffet November 21, 2017 for lunch. We have been coming here for years and the buffet was renovated very nice, was really impressed. That's the GOOD news, now the BAD news.  The food didn't meet our expectations from past years.  My friend got food poisoning eating the spoiled shrimp cocktail and was sick for five days, it messed up our entire trip. He was the only one in our party that ate shrimp and I remember him commenting the shrimp wasn't firm and was soft. Hope they get their act together and improve on their food preparation and their menu."}
{"text":"The buffet has plenty of choices and options of food to choose from. Me and my son come here almost every week. The waitress and waiters are very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Looking through yelp someone posted a picture of the prices which is not current. Today we went for brunch and with the B connected card it's actually $16.99 instead of $13.99. Regular price is 21.99. The b connected card applies for 2 guests so since there were 3 of us 2 of us ate for $16.99 and the third person was $21.99.
Asked for a high chair for my toddler (didn't have to pay for) they brought a highchair that was filthy with old food glued to it. So disgusting. Requested another highchair which was clean.
Food: was OK I was disappointed but my husband enjoyed it.  A lot of variety especially in the desserts section it was overwhelming but out of the 4 desserts that we sampled the pecan bar was the best. Overall food lacked flavor not worth the $ go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The new remodel is absolutely stunning! The whole feel of the buffet is completely different. You feel as if you are in a hotel on the strip. The decor is absolutely beautiful and the colors that were chose were perfect. The food was organized perfectly as someone would order a meal. Salads,deli meat, cubes cheeses , fruit and bread all beautifully arranged in the far left corner with the food selection flowing into American BBQ,Chinese,Italian ect. The food was excellent. I usually don't eat everything I get on my plate from buffets as it's mostly trial and error but I finished everything I chose. The prime rib was cooked perfectly and was no where near dry. The pasta station was incredible. The El Pastor tacos were to die for. Dessert was was good, the normal ice cream and pies. The service was outstanding! Our server was very polite and our drinks were never empty. Out plates were taken as soon as we finished. I have to say I really enjoyed the new atmosphere and attitude that the entire place gives off. We will be visiting again soon :)"}
{"text":"The food is  good but average. Nothing that separates from the other station casinos making the price a little too much. Seating is a bit unorganized as well. I think the communication needed is a bit over bearing at high volume times."}
{"text":"Came here on January 15 for Sunday brunch with my family. Good price for all you can eat &my parents enjoyed drinking champagne with their meal. Definitely will come back worth the money."}
{"text":"I would say FMB is in between  3.5 - 4 stars ~ 
We came here on a Sunday after much debate on what we wanted to eat and decided a buffet was perfect for a couple indecisive minds haha The price was $12.99 (with a player's card) for Sunday brunch which includes AYCD champagne~ The line moved super fast so we were happy about that and we both agreed that the food quality had improved from the last time we were here.. 
I really enjoyed the crawfish, prime rib, salmon filet, hot & sour soup, smoked salmon & cheese cubes.. My man couldn't get enough of the mustard hush puppy crab cakes things HAHA 

The server was nice & let us know she was leaving. She also made sure we had all the drinks we needed before she left! 
Nothing fancy here but you really can't beat the price and the food was actually good!

{"text":"The food was passable, but nothing extraordinary.  The salad bar is small, the selections at the other themed areas are strange... like why are there BBQ ribs on the Asian section when there are already 2 different kinds of ribs at the BBQ section, and look over here at the USA section... more ribs.  Ilike ribs well enough, but I was almost afraid to go to the Italian section for fear of seeing BBQ Rib Pizza.

The dessert bar is okay.  None of the pastries were phenomenal, the cheesecake was heavy and not at all creamy, and the blueberry topping on it had the consistency of drywall spackle.

Our drink-getter was pretty awesome, though.  She did a great job.

The best thing I can say about this buffet is that the lines are short and it's better than the buffet at a lot of the hotels on the strip, expecially those at the castle and pyramid... names omitted to keep from hurting King Arthur's and Pharaoh's feelings."}
{"text":"Comfort food buffet at it's best along with super nice people working there.  It's a smaller buffet compared to those on the strip, but they had enough choices to make it worthwhile.  The price point is perfect.  

One fun item they had for lunch was hamburgers and hotdogs!  What a fun addition!  They also still have gelato, which is rare as so many buffet's went with the less expensive soft serve."}
{"text":"You definitely get your money's worth here. It's clean, spacious, and there are a lot of great offerings. We were there for breakfast, and there was an omelette station, waffles, fresh fruits, blintzes, traditional breakfast meats, and also a mexican station. 

I think all the Boyd properties have some great buffets, but this one is hands down a favorite. Definitely worth a short drive from the strip."}
{"text":"For an off the strip buffet that only does breakfast & lunch I'd say it's good value for the money. The offerings are certainly less diverse than at other buffets in town, but what do you expect for $12. The staff was friendly and my water glass stayed mostly full. What higher praise could be given."}
{"text":"Come on a Thursday to try their dinner buffet, they have a huge dessert island, all different kinds of ice cream, cakes and pies, the food is pretty basic, has Italian, which has pasta and pizza, chinese has spring roll, chow fun, fried rice, american has fried chicken, ham, pork spareribs, slider, mexican has tacos, enchiladas, seafood has fried cat fish, crawdad, fried tilapia, the mongolian section, you can cook your choice of food and vegetables on a hot iron griddle, and for the meat lovers, they have roast beef and smoke spareribs, and don't forget to get the shrimp cocktail from the salute bar too....service is on par, the place is huge, so it is pretty roomy, you won't feel it is too crowded....overall it is okay, nothing special, for the price, it is a lot better than the strip casino buffet.."}
{"text":"When I first arrived I was excited to see a long line to get in for breakfast. I  came here with a Meet up Group  of around nine of us for Thursday morning breakfast. It was my first time here. My friends had been last week and stated they had some issues but were going to give it another try.
When I sat down The staff was terrible about getting our drink orders . They weren't friendly at all about Refills. I was really surprised because my experience since being in Vegas has been pretty friendly service.

The food was not cooked well at all. The Scrambled eggs looked RAW and the Sausage was burnt. The eggs benedict wasn't appealing at all.

Overall they had decent variety but bad quality service and very poor quality food. For the money its not a BAD breakfast if you're staying at the hotel but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for food otherwise."}
{"text":"Disgusting food and LOUD!!! Went to this dump on a Saturday at Noon. The chicken was dry, the salad was crappy looking...cheap iceberg crap, The beef ribs had no meat on them, the roast beef was juicy but was like chewing leather... I could only eat 2 bites. Some of the trays containing meats were empty. Without a doubt the crappiest buffet experience I have ever endured. What a joke..... you mean to tell me that on a Saturday, you can't supply fresh food when there's literally 200 plus people eating? You can't afford to put some romaine lettuce into the salad choice? What's sad is this poop hole is owned by Boyd gaming and they run the Suncoast Casino buffet which is decent. I will NEVER be back to this crap joint again.......What a waste of $20 for 2. Should have gone to the Texas station for a buffet."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of buffets. Trays of food being 'tampered' with freaks me out! I haven't been to a buffet in ages -- at least not the last 3 times we've been to Vegas, but this time, I had a craving for peel and eat shrimp. I don't eat much else at a buffet, so I said let's go to the Orleans for their buffet since it's really cheap and I know they have peel and eat shrimp.

OK so the pricing was super cheap -- it's $7.49 for lunch -- and it includes non-alcoholic beverages. There were the usual bbq stuff, Mexican stuff, Chinese stuff, Italian stuff, and an attempt at Mongolian bbq, which was rather dismal. 

I had about a pound and of a half of shrimp, a few slivers of bacon, 3 corn on the cob, a swirl of vanilla ice cream with crushed peanuts, 3 glasses of iced tea and I was done. I remembered last time they had these fantastic cookies, but there wasn't a cookie in sight. On top of that they have added a gelato station, but all the desserts were handed out, you couldn't help yourself to them.

For me, this buffet suffices because I don't really eat much at a buffet. Usually, I'll eat peel and eat shrimp, smoked salmon or trout, and lamb chops if they have them. What's the point of paying 20 bucks when that's all I eat? 

The buffet at the Orleans is fine by me. It has the shrimp, and I'm happy to pay $7.50 for it! I must say I remember there to be more selections so I have to deduct a star for this visit. However, I didn't feel ripped off and I was content when I stood up to leave.

PS: If you are my kind of buffet eater -- check out my review of the buffet at Palace Station -- I thought it was better than this one and for almost the same price!"}
{"text":"Came here at the suggestion of a friend for AYCE crawfish... secretly I'm a crawfish junky and after learning about this place, I don't think I'll ever go back to the Hot N' Juicy or Boiling Crab ever again!

The downside to it being a buffet is that they have to cater to the masses, so definitely no extra garlicky or extra spicy options available. However, find a willing cook and give them a tip and I'm sure you can get it flavored how you'd like. 

Their crawfish looks like it was on steroids with how big they were and I had to stop after 3 huge piled high plates of just crawfish alone! My friends and I were THOSE people that would basically pile up a lot of crawfish on our plates to the point where other people behind is would give us the stink eye... excuse it, it's an AYCE, don't get your knickers in a twist, they will replenish it haha. I even had to give my friends the side eye and sh1t talking at the table because they emptied out the pan when they went before me haha.

Their barbecue station was amazing. The pork and beef ribs were fall of the bone tender. 

Their made to order crepes were decent. I mean, yes they don't have the crepe pan to ensure it's a thin crepe, but the filling of fresh pineapple and blueberries made up for it.  Here's a tip: Tip your cooks who do a made to order anything in a buffet. Even a $1 is better than nothing. They were down to the last 2 crepes and the cook serviced me first because he knew I tipped him over the other person who was plain rude and didn't give them anything. It's kind of an unspoken rule seeing as you know, they're serving you something fresh and not just something in a pan that's been sitting in their warmer in the back. 

Seeing as this trip was all about the crawfish, I didn't really try anything else. That'll be for the next visit. But definitely one of the better buffets in town that's off the strip."}
{"text":"my favorite buffet in  the city. i use to go all the time on saturday night when it was steak and shrimp scampi night. make sure you get the players card. it cost around 17. well worth it the food is amazing and the selection is just great."}
{"text":"The Medley buffet inside the Aliante Casino has got to be one of my favorite locals buffets. The prices are reasonable, the service has always been really good and friendly, and the food is good! 

I had dinner on a Sunday night and there were many good choices, I would have liked to see beef ribs instead of pork but never the less a good selection. 

Don't expect to see gourmet, but do expect to have a good dinner at a reasonable price, and very clean buffet."}
{"text":"I have been here 10+ times. The restaurant is located inside the Orleans casino that is a smoking lounge.

Cheap buffet, average quality. Large selection. There is no item at this joint that makes me crave for. I came here just to load up on fiber and protein between business dealings. 

Service is always good. Discounts for members of Boyd gaming."}
{"text":"One of the best value buffets in Vegas!

Not on the strip, so it's not so crowded, and I've eaten here twice without ever having to wait in line.

Good variety too - for lunch and dinner, they categorize the food: USA, Italian, Chinese, Mexican, Seafood, Mongolian, BBQ, and a huge dessert section in the middle.

A lot of the food is pretty decent, though I didn't think the ribs were that great. The shrimp cocktails were fresh, and I liked the Mexican and Seafood sections the most.

The dessert section also had no-sugar desserts!

Super cheap, we came here for lunch on a Friday and it was only $10/person, without any kind of membership or anything.

It's not the Bellagio or anything but French Market Buffet at the Orleans offers great value in terms of quality and variety!"}
{"text":"Don't come here until they are done with renovations! Currently the buffet is located in a temporary location until renovations are complete. The selection is much smaller & not quality food. Normally this is a great spot, but not right now"}
{"text":"5 stars for:  price (amazingly low), selection (even french fries, which are rare for buffets!), and quality foods.  Both times we've been here, waitstaff has been below par, but we didn't seem to mind.  Seriously, with a player's card, the price for lunch was $9.99 a person.  For a local's casino, thus buffet blew away Red Rock and Suncoasts."}
{"text":"Boy do you get your money's worth here. Great pricing and service gets you seated quickly. And the seafood buffet rivals those on the strip but at half the cost. A great hidden gem in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong at this off the strip buffet. Great price. Food is actually pretty good and tasty. Wok Wednesday are so good!!  Haven't tried the Hawaiian pork night yet, but I'm sure it's not bad. We went there for thanksgiving, Mother's Day and steak/shrimp night with a bunch of people and was great tasting. Kids enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food I mean I went for lunch buffet and had some discount coupons so got it all for a five spot. Can't beat that I am sure it was the same food offered on their dinner menu but just at the reduced rate. I sure was hungry the day I was here too. I put away some food and kept smiling. I liked the BBQ ribs here, Prime Rib and fried shrimp."}
{"text":"I've been here now for breakfast and for lunch, and I gotta admit, they were pretty good.  Not every item was great or anything, but over all I definitely enjoyed both meals. This place is DEFINITELY better then suncoast buffet. That place went down hill YEARS ago and is gross.

I will definitely be back to this place and just fyi, not only did this buffet have a crowd of people, so did the casino area too.  So people are comin here for a reason. ;-)"}
{"text":"Great place to eat for breakfast, lunch, & dinner buffet. Close to home too! Plus the service is good. Simple choices for that buffet fix. After the buffet I hit up the slot machines & win that big money yadada?! Lol..."}
{"text":"While waiting to watch a transformers 3, me and my fiancee was hit by a hungry monster. So we decided to take the later show and fill our tummy with some monster food. 

The wait wasnt that long and they have some special for $13 perperson at 4 pm everyday except wednesday and friday I guess. All and all the food was considerably yummy although I only like a very few items. 

Service are ok and I dont even bother to get myself a second serving. A-ok for moi!"}
{"text":"Eating here will make you sick.  I eat here once a month and I always eat so much food I leave feeling sick, but still have a gelato cone in my hand.
The food is good, the just changed the price structure so breakfast and lunch are $1 more and dinner is $1 less.  I usually only go here because I have free offers or 2 for 1.  The dinner is now $22 on Friday for crab night, so even with a 2-1 is more expensive then many dinners you can get.  You will always leave full, but you will also get full at a stations at half the price."}
{"text":"Medley (formerly Feast Buffet) gets a 4 because of these top 5 reasons:

1. Lunch is a measly $10.99 with players card
2. Automatic gratuity is a modest 10% for large parties (up it to 20% 'cause the server was great)
3. Service is very good (refills on drinks came without asking)
4. Food selection is decent and food quality is good.
5. NO WAIT!


Carving station featured roast beef, ham and roasted turkey.  The roast beef and ham were tender and juicy and better than I expected. 

Salad selection: 3 types of salad (spinach, ice berg lettuce, mixed greens.  No honey mustard dressing - if that is your favorite, sorry not available. 

Dessert station was average although I did like the better than average gelato bar flavors. 

The layout is very similar to Red Rock.  Iced tea is brewed.  In general it's a good value for some comfort food."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. And reasonable price.

Nancy was a great server. Didnt bug too much but got us what we needed. Their meat selection is great. And for dessert I had some ice cream. Love their pistachio one. 

Also if you have the players card, you get a dollar off. We checked what promotion they had going on with the players card on their kiosk..and got a 2 for 1 entry."}
{"text":"Wife and I in Las Vegas for several days and  the Medley buffet at Aliante was one of the best values.  Good food at reasonable prices, just sign up for players card to get discounted price.  As comparison.the buffet at Red Rock sucked and buffet at Planet Hollywood was twice the cost and not as good so Medley is good value."}
{"text":"This is a little pricey but when you have 2 for 1 it not that bad. But the food is worth the price it is great!! Love it!!! We went yesterday 1st time we been since they re-did it, and we WILL be back it was simply great!!! Love the selections of food and the taste was great!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying out this buffet at New Orleans Casino. Coming here on friday night for seafood buffet. This is surprisingly good and beyond my expectation. It is inexpensive as well for $27.99 per person. A lot of crab legs from both areas for hot and cold. They got the raw oysters, shrimps, big mussels, whole fish, prime rib and full rack of beef short ribs. Love the beef short ribs. It was so juicy and so good.
Absolutely a very good quality of foods. I'll definitely be back next time soon whenever I were in Vegas."}
{"text":"Buffets in Vegas are pricey on the strip and I get it. This one is close to home and still satisfies. 

Tuesdays, Fridays or Saturdays are our favorite days to go. On Tuesday, they actually roast whole pigs for Hawaiian night and T loves crispy pata! The chefs cut up perfectly sized squares for you to pick from. There is all purpose sauce for dipping too. And I know it must be pretty legit because it gets packed and the line gets long real quick. So take note and allow yourself to have an early dinner, then go walk it off around Discovery Park.

Friday and Saturday is prime rib and seafood night aka crab legs aka me trying not to panic the entire time in fear for our son's life (shellfish allergy). These are not my favorite nights because of the aforementioned, but he has never had any problems here which is a testament to how clean they keep it. The oysters are never good, the sushi is so-so, but the crab legs are real decent as is their prime rib. I only get the prime rib when they have the real horseradish and not the creamy one. They've only been out once though. Not bad out of the dozens of times we've been before.

In addition to the main attractions, they have great BBQ (I'm a fan of the ribs), roast turkey and a very nice salad bar area. Chicken fingers, hot dogs, fries and burgers are found over by the BBQ and are always good (according to the fry/hot dog/burger critic). Oddly enough, their pozole is very good as well. I don't partake in the desserts here because there is nothing to accommodate me accept for fruit, and that's always fresh, but they have a fairly wide selection of ice cream/toppings, cookies, cakes and pies. They even had a sugar free section.

I appreciate there is such a decent buffet a few minutes away from my house and that it's very reasonably priced. Don't forget your players card and monthly coupons for Buy 1 get 1 free!!"}
{"text":"In a word...edible. Since Stations left...it's gone downhill. Even so, still light years better than Cannery on Craig Rd...which is HORRIBLE!! We're really lacking any really good places to eat in the Northwest part of town!"}
{"text":"Came here during Mother's day.  Cost was about $19-20.  They served Mexican, Chinese, sushi, dessert (cake and ice cream), breakfast, salad/veggies, and seafood.  Drinks served were soda, coffee, and champagne.  Overall, the food was just okay."}
{"text":"Great buffet especially for the price! We went to breakfast buffet for $7.99 with club card. OJ was good and great omelet bar. Several folks making omelets. We will be back! Short breakfast hours though M- Saturday (8-10am)"}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet costs only $8.99 per person with a Players' Club card.  Including drink, this is a deal!  The food tastes good and there is plenty of variety:  omelettes, chocolate waffles, doughnuts, cereal, fruit, sausage, and much more.  If you come near the end of breakfast hours you can get the best of both worlds when they switch to lunch fare, including seafood, BBQ, Mongolian, and more.  My friends also loved the AYCE seafood dinner buffet -- the cost is a little bit more, maybe $15, but they quickly ate more than that in crab legs, mussels, clams, and shrimp.

Come early in the morning to avoid any lines.  This represents superior value compared to the Courtyard Cafe, which is also in the Orleans, though that Cafe is 24 hours.  There an entree plus drink could easily cost you $12 or more."}
{"text":"This is our go-to buffet for a seafood crab night where we don't end up paying an arm and a leg.  Its not a high end strip buffet but its decent for the price.  Every Fridays between 4pm-9pm you're looking at spending 28.99 per person.  Go early because the line can get really long.  We went at 8pm and still waited 30 minutes before we got seated.  

If you're like us and you love crab, you have two options here, steam and frozen.  You can also ask them to stir fry the crab at the Mongolian station in a yummy asian blend sauce.  Also, the oysters are awesome.  Especially if you can get them right when they first bring out a new bucket.  Freshness!

The buffet is split up into sections, Mexican, Chinese, Italian, Salad Bar, Seafood, small Hawaiian/Japanese section, and of course dessert.  One thing I can not get over is their fondue station.  Ladies and gentlemen there is a chocolate fountain.  Yes, I just said it.  Running waterfall of chocolate with a spread of marshmallows, pineapple, bread, strawberries, and a few other items you can submerge into the brown gooeyness.  Awesome goodness."}
{"text":"It's better than ever now that they renovated 
Food is way better and tastier 
Opens till 8pm
Prices are $20ish depending on the day 
Friday's are steak and ribs night! Super delish 
Sunday's seafood it's a little more on those days 
I always come for the crawfish!! 
Because it's so bombbbbb here 
This is the only place that I know that steams the crawfish without seasoning it and it's the best ever!!! It's so fresh and doesn't smell 

My sissy always make her own sauce for the crawfish and it's our dipping sauce so when we come we strictly come for just the crawfish! 
It's my heaven 

Everything else is pretty yummy! 
This place is very worth it, prices are awesome and food is pretty tasty"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food especially on Tuesday nights. The one star is for the ridiculous pricing they have for kids. I understand $9.99 per kid up to a certain age. BUT for them to charge that amount for a 2 year old?! Come on Aliante! That is a pretty absurd price for a toddler."}
{"text":"It's not fair to compare Medley Buffet to the Buffet at Bellagio, the buffet at Wynn or Bacchanal Buffet because this place is pretty cheap for a buffet.

Located at the Orleans Hotel & Casino, The Medley Buffet has create your own omelette station, basic breakfast stations (egg, sausage, bacon, pancake, waffle, etc), Chinese stations, Mexican stations, donuts, ham & sausage station and assorted pastries.

I was excited to see donuts, sweet potato pancake, menudo & beef fried steak.

3 stars!! 

Medley Buffet is almost yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"The new buffet name is Medley. For me to consider going back, they need to change their tune.

It seems like everything that was fine with the old buffet, they decided to go with the opposite on the new one.

From the way they get you in there to the fact there's no signs for at least half the items to the bland food, this is an utter disaster.

I hope they can get their act together soon because there'll be no one coming back if they keep this up."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! The price is right and the quality and variety of food here is great.  They have different stations with different types of food from Italian, Asian, American, to Mexican.  Their desserts are decent.  There was this special where you pay $22 for all day buffet privileges.  I would have done that if I weren't already all burnt out on buffets during my trip to Vegas.  It's a smokin' deal!  If you're staying at the Orleans, take advantage of this hidden gem in your hotel.  It blew away the other buffet I went to on the strip."}
{"text":"Best Price in Las Vegas for lunch Buffet.

I love eating at an all you can eat buffet.

I think this place is very good. I just come here to eat and save some money on my trip to vegas.

They have a wide variety of food to choose from.

They even have mongolian grill.

Is just 1.5 miles off the strip."}
{"text":"The dining area is clean and the staff are friendly.  We visited the location during lunch time which is $12 for adult.  The food overall is okay.  The hamburgers and fries section is standard along with corn on the cob.  The Chinese food section had dumplings, white rice, fried rice, lo mein, Asian ribs, beef with barcoli, and tofu.  The fried rice and lo mein wasn't fresh or hot which was surprising since we just got there when they opened for lunch at 11:00 AM.  They also have an Italian  food section with cheese and pepperoni pizzas, ritoni and traditional spaghetti with either tomato or spicy sausage sauces.  All were hot and very good.  They also had roasted turkey and roast beef wich was freshly cut by a server along with your choice of side dishes, i.e. mac and cheese, mashed potatoes with your choice of gravey, etc.   There is also a Mexican good section to make your own tacos and burritos.  Lastly, there is a vast dessert section which will lure you into a new diet plan.  Overall, everything was good, but they can make improvements.  Food can be kept warmer.  Our server only came once to give us our drinks, but she never came back thus the reason why I didn't leave a tip."}
{"text":"On weekdays a lunch at Medley Buffet is only $8.99. I had a BOGO coupon so lunch for two with drinks came to $9.72 - not too shabby. Unless you come on a night where there is a special dining theme (Hawaiian, Seafood), the available food options are always the same and typical of other Station Casinos. I always find myself hovering over the Italian and Mexican cuisine. For this occasion, I loaded up on Cheese Ravioli with some type of cream based sauce, garlic bread sticks, and a Caesar salad. On my second trip, I tried to do Mexican but was disappointed that they didn't have refried beans (they had black beans instead, but who wants to eat that healthy nonsense?). For dessert, I had two scoops of mint chocolate ice cream. One plus is that at Medley, the ice cream tastes like ice cream and not that gross watered down stuff. 

Bottom Line: the majority of the food is strictly mediocre, but for the price, you can't complain because you get to stuff your face on a dime."}
{"text":"Mediocre. We went to Hawaiian pig night which is Tuesday night. It was later in the evening around 8 (they close at 9) and there was still a good amount of pig left but it was really dry.....the chicken long rice was not chicken long rice. I expected poke but there wasn't any...the spam fried rice was bland...I was disappointed with the offering. Whoever is in charge should be ashamed. This buffet should and could be good maybe need some competition because some of their food prep just looks lazy; the chicken long rice, spinach luau, and the fact that they had the sauce bottles for the pig just laying out their are good examples. The positives were the teriyaki meatballs and the teriyaki pork chops. Who ever is making the teriyaki stuff should get promoted. And of course the desserts were the usual good stuff. Love their pistachio ice cream. 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"So, this was once Feast Buffet.  I'm glad there's nothing that really changed though except for the name. As I've written in my Feast Review that I could no longer find, the best time to go is when they serve whatever food you like.  There's seafood night which I'm not too concerned about since I'm allergic to shellfish, and then, there's Lechon Tuesday!

My buddy, Lawrence M was excited when I told him they have lechon. So, off we went!  We weren't sure what time they close so, we felt bad when we got there 3 minutes before they close.  We had a plan B in mind and were ready to march to a different place to eat but they allowed starving gym rats like us to go ahead and stuff our faces.  It really pays to be polite and kind! The hostesses, our server and foo station attendants were nice eventhough we got there so late. So yeah, they close at 9pm.

Dinner for us was only about $12 with military discount on Veterans Day.  Normally, it's about $12/person and you get a discount with a player's card. That's really cheap! I'll say this again, lechon can be expensive because not a lot of places have it. You have to be in-the-know where to get lechon and normally, you have to pre-order it and buy the whole pig for abput $200 depending on the size of the pig. Anthony Bourdain dubs this succulent pig with crispy skin THE BEST PIG he's ever had. So, even if you paid full price for the buffet, you definitely get your money's worth. Get this, they even have Mang Tomas lechon sauce.

They have the typical buffet fare such as prime rib, turkey, BBQ ribs, salads, pizza, pasta, potatoes, veggies, Chinese food, Mexican food, pies, cakes, cookies, ice cream, etc. Since we got there so late, the soft serve was liquid - but I didn't care, I just want the taste. The lady behind the counter kept telling me that it's liquid. But I like ice cream soup. The only thing was the coffee ice cream had ice particles. The other flavor I got was fine. The lady behind the ice cream and pie counter was sweet and funny.

Items on my plates:
Lechon - absolutely great! Skin was crispy - finding crispy skin requires great skill. 5/5

Chicken Fajitas - a bit dry. 2/5

Steamed BBQ Pork Buns - most buffet places that serve these are awful - too doughy, too dry. These were quite good for a buffet place. 4/5

Sesame Balls - they're tinier than the ones you'll find at Chinese restaurants but this isn't a Chinese restaurant. These have red bean inside. 4/5

Fried Plantains - I love fried bananas! Some bananas were soft, some were firmer. I pefer the softer ones as they tend to be sweeter. 4/5

Meatballs - these were pretty good. Either that or I was just very hungry after working out. They're not dry and they're quite tasty. 3.5/5

Prime Rib - juicy, medium-rare slice of beef. Mmmmm...3.5/5

Turkey - I was expecting a very dry piece of turkey because it's closing time and it probably has been sitting under a heating lamp forever. I was pleasantly surprised that it was juicy. 4/5

French Fries - I was so happy to see they have fries. I love fries! Warm, crispy fried potaoes. Add a little bit of salt and I'm happy. 4/5

Kielbasa - I've been good at avoiding cured meats lately but Lawrence gave me his sausage. Since it was already on my plate, I had to try it. Maybe, I'm not used to salt anymore but it was pretty salty. 3/5"}
{"text":"This is my favourite buffet in town, it's reasonably priced and has a great selection.....doesn't matter what time of day you come, there's always a big selection with cooking stations cooking to order.  The staff are all good and very attentive"}
{"text":"I liked the price and the food wasn't bad either. The salad bar is small in comparison to many other buffets but who goes to a buffet and eats a salad?  Right? 

They have a BBQ area, stir fry and make your own pasta stations, a Mexican food area and pizza and pastas. Oh and then there's dessert. I think they may actually have more dessert than food options. Soft serve, cakes and pies, gelato and sorbets and my dad's favorite: the bread pudding. 

I enjoyed the breakfast buffet with the omelet station and crisp bacon!  

The waitstaff that brought your beverages and took away your dirty plates were really nice and prompt with our drinks. 

I had to minus a star because of the cashiers. On one occasion the cashier was rude and charged us incorrectly even after we told her numerous times how many people were in our party. She was downright sassy commenting on other people being served near us \"oh there's another one, must a full mood out tonight\"."}
{"text":"I usually had a good meal here, but not last night for the prime rib and crab night. The crab was over cooked and the prime rib resembled some sort of dog food that comes out of a can. Not only was this expensive trip a waste of my time, but on top of it, I got food poisoning. I'm not talking about a slight upset stomach either- these are full blown flu-like symptoms. I have a fairly strong stomach, as I have ate bad MREs. Well, this buffet broke the barrier. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Worst buffet I have ever experienced in my life.   Nothing was edible.  Everything was old and dry.   Terrible location.   Prison food is an upgrade, I suggest you try that first."}
{"text":"Garbage!!! Same old crap guys. Don't be fooled in business we call it old lady wearing new dress. Same odor same food and textures.  Unimpressed!!"}
{"text":"We'll I was expecting a way better buffet than before with the remodel. A bit disappointed with the food. The buffet looks more modern and better lighting. Only huge change was the look and the price. As expected to pay for the remodel the price has gone up a bit. Used to love buffets proceed under $20 for dinner. I think the new leader in town is the new Palms AYCE buffet. 

The quality of food hasn't changed much compared to before. Ya it's expanded a bit but the only huge change I saw was a crepe station and a pho station which I didn't care for. The only big change I saw was the dessert station which improved a lot with higher end desserts like creme brule. They always had a gelato station. 

My always favorite thing was to go there to eat the BBQ beef ribs which they still serve for dinner only. They also had prime rib but was very low quality of meat and tough. Who would've thought prime rib would be tough. 

The Chinese section was decent the lo mein was good. Now sushi no matter what buffet you go to in Vegas is a must void food. They make it ahead of time and refrigerate it and you can tell the rice isn't made right. Anyways any buffet you go to sushi and pizza are a must avoid period unless you like crap food.

I honestly would only go here if I wanted all you eat beef ribs and gelato. For cheaper price I'd rather go to palms buffet way better quality. Even tho less quantity.

They also has a Al pastor station that looked decent.

The dinner price with players card was $20.57 you saved $2 with card. This is during week day."}
{"text":"we came for champagne brunch. $12.99 with my players card... not too shabby. 

the menu items were diverse and bountiful. i was quite suprised, considering the \"classic\" stature of the hotel, how fresh and varied the food was. granted it was $3 champagne, it was still a great deal. 

they offered all kinds of different cuisine. mexican, italian, american, asian, a good sized salad/grilled veggie bar and a huge dessert bar. they also had an omelet station. the sections had typical items, enchiladas, pastas, bbq, cornbeef hash, shrimp, mussels, ham, roast beef,, corn on the cob, kung pao beef and most anything you can think of. each section was very well tended and replenished. the areas were clean and all the food looked delicious. the champagne lady came around frequently too. 

for the price and selection, this was an extremely awesome champagne brunch buffet."}
{"text":"The food here is \"okay.\"  Ate here for breakfast and dinner and they definitely carry some items over from one meal to the other.  For example, the breakfast fruit (cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon) will turn into a fruit salad for the dinner menu.

The menu offerings do not vary day after day.   Shrimp cocktail and crawdads are very popular as people take them by the platefuls back to their seats.  Most of the items I had were slightly warm at best, including the soups. 

There are 2 salad bars that have different toppings and salad dressings.  The soups are the same on both sides though.  

Best part of the meal is the gelato bar for lunch/dinner.  They offer about 8 different varieties including: mango, mint chocolate chip, lemon, raspberry , caramel, white chocolate, vanilla, etc...

Slightly disappointed that this place lacks any FRENCH food.  (French salad dressing doesn't count!)  After all, this is the French Market buffet, a crepe station or hot/fresh benets would be nice."}
{"text":"This was my first Vegas lunch buffet during my trip and it was ok. My aunt had a coupon from the casino of Buy1 Get1Free. It was about $10 for the 2 of us. I thought the layout was gorgeous and huge!! The waitress was attentive, nice, polite, and friendly.

There was a lot of food to choose from like an Southern style to Asian. There is also a nice salad bar in the middle alone. The food tasted ok overall. I tired some waffles and they were dried out. We were here about 11:30am. So I guess it was leftover from breakfast.

The desert bar had a wide variety too. I got pistachio ice-cream. I thought overall this place was and I wouldn't recommend making a drive all the way from the strip. If you are close and want to try it out or the casino, then give it a shot. If not, pass on this to get a better buffet. I'm glad we had the coupon because I wasn't too impress with this place."}
{"text":"They have gotba New York steak, short beef ribs, Chinese duck, little red lobsters, French crepes (on cooking station), roast beef on the regular dinner night which is really worth the price"}
{"text":"I'll keep it short. Crawfish (fresh) and Beef Ribs (fall off the bone goodness). YUM! And for less than $10/person for lunch? That's a steal!

oh, and desserts were great too :)"}
{"text":"I arrived a minute or two before they opened at 8am on a Saturday and waited about 7 minutes in line which isn't too bad. 

The cost is only $9.99 (11 something with Tax) - which is actually a great price - not all of the food on the breakfast buffet is good but there are some hidden gems 

DOs - bacon - it's extra crispy !
        - tater tots - cannot screw these up!
        - hash browns - crisp not soggy
        - multi-grain waffle w/strawberry sauce
        - pancakes - not super awesome but probably IHOP quality 
       - omelette bar - customize just ask for less oil so it isn't saturated. 

DO NOTS - eggs Benedict - disastrous 
                 - standard eggs - just bad 
            
 Service is very friendly. The person assigned to my table came back frequently to check my coffee and water to see if I needed more and took my plates away. 

Coffee is a go!

I only rank this 3 stars BC I've hit just about every buffet in Vegas and even with the $9.99 cost this one isn't rated up super high... But if you are staying at the Orleans you can get an omelette, waffle, pancakes, hash browns, toast, juice w coffee for around 11 bucks and if you got all that a joint it would cost like $30 so it's more of a bargain spot than one you would enjoy the food a lot!"}
{"text":"So they closed it down and remolded. Bringing the buffet up to par with most of the other casino properties.  It has a modern vibe, with muted earthen tones, browns, grays and golds. 

They spread the buffet line from one end to the other without the middle salad bar. One cool feature I really enjoyed was the middle of the line a made to order crepe station with fresh fruit. My husband kicked it a notch and made himself a bowl of ice cream topped off with fresh bananas and banana foster sauce he then added to his crepe! 

The salad end if facing the line is on the left, everything was fresh and the staff kept it that way while we where there. I even saw them change out the rolls with fresh ones! The opposite end is the desserts and the strawberry sorbet was way too good! Cleaned the palate.

There where several soups, it was seafood night so there where two gumbos. Sushi was decent for a buffet. I wasn't a fan of the warm crab legs, they seemed to be a bit over cooked, but I loved the fish taco. The filet was crispy and love the combination slaw with it. There is cold crab legs, oysters, muscles and clams as well as the peel and eat shrimp and crawfish!

It's been improved for sure. Clean, servers keeping up with refills and the line monitored for freshness! Friday night, seafood night. You gotta try it."}
{"text":"Good buffet, some cool Louisiana-inspired options, along with the usual salad bar, meat options and dessert bar. I like the custom crepes, which I had loaded with Nutella and chocolate chips. 

Options a bit on the thin side compared to other buffets (the one at Cosmopolitan being my favorite), but really a first-world problems sort of complaint, as there were plenty of choices I enjoyed."}
{"text":"I dined in on friday night when they were serving seafood night. The selection was great as it had snow crab, dung. crab, crayfishes (huge!), shrimp, & raw oysters. The feasting night gave me food coma but that's when you know they did a good job!. Services was good as our server kept checking in on us and clearing out our plates ASAP. This wouldn't replace my favorite buffet spot at the Bellagio but it's up to par! Will return when in vegas."}
{"text":"BLUF: If you for some reason just absolutely have to go to a buffet, then at least go on a night they have specials.

The service was good, people were very friendly.

The food was mediocre at best. Bland and tough, some of the meat had clearly been sitting under the heat lamps for far too long. The selection was ok, but nothing really unique. It's a buffet, so I didn't expect much and it still was underwhelming.

If you still want to try this place, at least pick a night where they have specials that you like (prime rib, crab legs, pig, something)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We came here about an hour and a half towards closing (we had no idea) and they didn't rush us to finish up. The buffet line moves swiftly and there's so many options to choose from. They have a salad bar and a dessert bar as well!! The wait staff are efficient in clearing plates and refilling drinks and they're friendly. Believe me, I'm from Hawaii and you'll be amazed at how appreciative I was that the workers were so friendly. Most people don't acknowledge you when you say thank you to them, but they always returned it. 

Anyways, there is a section that's smacked in the middle of the buffet where you can build your own pasta!! They'll cook it right in front of you. It's a mini show and I enjoyed it as much as I loved the pasta!! So fresh. So delicious. Always remember to tip the chef a dollar because trust me, the portion is PLENTY and it's sooo ono. The line gets a bit long, but the chefs move quickly. 

Dessert Bar: you can get ice cream in a bowl. However, if you CANNOT finish your ice cream... you're allowed to ask for a cone for your ice cream and you're ALLOWED to take it out of the restaurant!! How cool is that?! Lol if I wasn't so full, I woulda taken an ice cream cone to-go! Lol they also have so much flavors to choose from. Mix the flavors, you'll be amazed at how yummy some flavors taste, mixed. Haha

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very pleasant. Noise level isn't too loud. We were dressed casually so don't be too concerned about dressing up. Although it is a nice place. So I definitely felt underdressed. Use whatever you feel comfortable wearing. Lastly, just a few stores down, there's a Starbucks!!! That is ALWAYS a bonus in my book. Lol


10/10, I'm definitely coming back when I go to Vegas next year!"}
{"text":"This is hard, for value I'd easily give this 4 stars plus (at 17.99 the food is excellent), great variety, and it's really really good. 

But, it's not Caesar's, but hey it's less than half the price. I think Caesar's and Orleans would be my 1/2 go tos in that order. You should try both. 

I'd rate it at 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Yelps 365 Review Challenge 2014 - Los Angeles #65 - #365

Don't expect 5 star quality, it's more like 4 star quality with 2 star pricing. I'd honestly rate the Luxor and Excalibur buffets a 1 - 2 stars. The food here is not the greatest compared to the strip buffets but it gets the job done. 

What i liked about the buffet was the prime rib, crab legs, cocktail shrimp, and the crawfish (New Orleans Style). They also had different sections of food, like;

-American
-Italian
-Seafood 
-Mexican
-BBQ
-Cooking Stations
-Dessert 

I would come back to save some extra money if I'm ever in town to save some money from the strip buffets and restaurants. Anything to save a buck from the tourist trap areas."}
{"text":"Really more of a 3.5, but I digress.

So, let's say your family gambles at The Orleans so much that they get dining comps from them all the time, right? Since that describes my family to a T, lately, we've been going here about once per month thanks to comps that allow us to eat here for basically free. 

Is it the best buffet in town? Not quite, but it ranks pretty high up there among locals places at least. As a matter of fact, the Feast Buffets at the Stations are the only ones that give this joint a run for it's money. 

There are numerous Creole, Cajun and other southern-style touches scattered throughout. Most notable is the fact that it's probably the only buffet in town that serves crayfish. And eight times out of ten, gumbo is included as one of the daily soup options. Everything else is pretty standard fare, but most of it is done fairly well. The chicken wings in particular are always tender, well-seasoned and tend to fall right off the bone. 

One major gripe I have about this place is how certain things aren't seasoned up to par. The last time I came I tried to do some makeshift Hoppin' John with black eyed peas and smoked sausage and it just ended up tasting like a bland, soggy mess. Another one is that desserts tend to be pretty hit and miss. The ribs are also tough as nails but I've found that to be true of ribs at literally EVERY buffet so that's just a universal complaint right there.

They also have a \"Mongolian\" section which is probably the most useless section to have in a buffet ever. Other than that though, you do get your money's worth here. Especially if you're able to eat her for essentially free. *Wink Wink*

The Final Verdict

Pros:
Generous comp provided by The Orleans.
One of the better locals casino buffets.
Wide variety of cajun and creole delicacies available.
Diverse selection of seafood as well. 
Usually friendly service.
Probably one of the fastest moving lines for a buffet I've ever seen.

Cons:
Occasionally a little deficient in the seasoning department.
Sometimes great desserts, sometimes not. 
Decor in dire need of updating.

Huh?:
Why is there a Mongolian section? Like, for real?

Suggestions:
Replace that Mongolian section with either 1. A crepe making station or 2. A full-fledged Cajun/Creole/Soul Food section. Also, beignets in the dessert section! That way the theme comes full circle!

Return factor: 10/10. We're probably going to get another comp in the mail anyway."}
{"text":"You kind of have to go to a buffet while you're in Vegas, right? This one has a fantastic selection at a reasonable price: italian, mexican, asian, cajun, fried things, meat stuff, soups, salad, and an especially impressive dessert variety: ice cream, cakes, pies, danishes, all kinds of stuff! I went at breakfast, so they had breakfast things too like waffles, omeletes, and pancakes. The dishes were hit or miss quality wise, as generally to be expected at a buffet, but the majority of it was quite good, and the beauty of a buffet is that you can try all kinds of stuff and eat more of what you like! I think my favorite dishes were the shrimp/cheese enchilada, churros, mashed potatoes, crabcakes, and apple crumble. And convenient if you're staying in the hotel!"}
{"text":"Food is decent enough, not worth the price but. will try other places before i hit this one again"}
{"text":"The date of this review is December 25, 2016.

This French Market Buffet is located inside the Orleans Hotel and Casino. It is on Tropicana Avenue and it is a little distance from Las Vegas Blvd. (The Strip). They offer very reasonably priced food with great taste! 

On Tuesday, December 20, 2016, we had lunch. On Wednesday, December 21, 2016 and Thursday, December 22, 2016 we had dinner. Each time we have been at the French Market Buffet there was a large selection of buffet items.

They offer several types of food, Italian (pasta, pizza, etc.), Mexican (enchiladas, salsa, beans, etc.) Chinese (sweet and sour, fried rice, egg rolls, etc.), American (turkey, chicken, biscuit, gravy, etc.), Mongolian (stir fried noodles, etc.), Seafood (crawfish, shrimp, etc. (sorry, no crab legs!)), and BBQ (Prime rib roast, BBQ beef ribs, boiled corn, etc.) A standard salad bar and a dessert bar (cakes, ice cream, pies, cheesecake, etc.) are also provided.

The chefs are very cordial and accommodating. We asked the BBQ chef for two generous prime rib roast meat to be grilled on the BBQ. He gladly obliged and served us.

The lunch is $11.99 and the dinner is $18.99, each very much worth the price. My wife and I both enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"Ugh, the crab legs were either very salty or bland with no happy medium and in my view were over cooked and old. The crab meat would crumble and had no taste. Everything else was just so. The entire buffet was mediocre at best and I would not be back."}
{"text":"Everything we ate was either over-salted or bland.  Enchiladas, eggplant Parmesan, Chinese spicy shrimp, steamed pollack, stuffing, all way too salty. Crawfish, egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, egg rolls all bland, no flavor at all. Everything else didn't really look appetizing. The ribs were tough to eat. The Chinese ribs, too dry. Chicken gumbo was ok. They had Cajun style offerings like fried catfish and hush puppies, but it looked like it had been sitting there for too long, so I avoided it. The only thing that tasted great was their prime rib and mashed potatoes. Dessert selection was nice. They had gelato and sorbet as well as soft serve. Lots of cakes and pies, but didn't try. They have a chocolate fountain where you can dip fruit and cream puff in. Kids loved that part. Our meal was a decent value only for the prime rib. Our waiter Manny did a great job at taking care of us."}
{"text":"Their quality has gotten better and this is a run of the mill average buffet. Neither good nor bad, and they often have coupons that come in the mail."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! What was once one of the best values in LV considering the price and fairly unique southern food has changed to an ordinary buffet you can find in other casinos. The remodel was nice but the food got much worse although the price went up by $3+. I visited the buffet for breakfast and lunch (decided not to bother for dinner). The southern food has virtually disappeared and only a few of the dishes previously served from the French Market buffet are there. It also seems the executive chef has changed because the food tastes worse for a lot of the dishes. And the shrimp...my gosh, I told management 3x that the shrimp was old/bad/spoiled and 3x they kept changing the shrimp and it was still bad. I'm sure many people got sick that day. Also, they serve menudo for breakfast but not for lunch? If you're looking for a vestige from the French Market go elsewhere, you won't find it at Medley anymore. Sadly, I will pass on this buffet which is one of the reasons why I go to the Orleans in the first place as it was once one of my favorite buffets to go to."}
{"text":"We go to a buffet at least once a week and our current favorite is the Suncoast. Today we were nearby the Orleans so we decided to eat here for lunch. There was no wait on a Saturday after 1:00 pm. We were pleasantly surprised to find both pork ribs and beef ribs. The beef ribs were great but the pork ribs had a strange aftertaste. I loved the Italian broccoli and the onion soup (minus the cheese and croutons). The Chinese section had well prepared baby bok choy that was not overcooked like at other buffets. What was especially nice was the chart defining the gluten free choices and the dessert section which included a selection of gluten free options. The only picky thing was that the hand cleaners were hard to find and one was broken. $12.99 with players card is a bargain slightly off strip. Btw, it was less smoky than usual."}
{"text":"A couple friends were in town and they were staying at the New Orleans. We were going to head to that other restaurant that serves mainly seafood, and I'm allergic.  And the story gets written err typed from there...

No line, walked straight to the cashier, and in...that had to have been record time for a buffet line! Lunch was on my friend so I don't even know how much it came out to nor did I bother to read how much. Probably wasnt interested as I could forsee myself never coming back anyway.

There are buffets you may try and know...just know...once you have your plate in hand and start doing the slow zombie walk as your eyes wait for something from the warmers to jump out at you...and nothing doesn't. So you forcefully tell yourself, just get something. And I did...

Everything aside from salads because I swear you almost can't go wrong with salads unless the dressing is gross or the salads are wilted...and buffets never screw up on salads...regressing here, okay...everything I had was bland, boring, and dry. That was me trying a dish from every country they offered. I even had a simple rye grilled cheese sandwich or something like that...and THAT was bland, boring, and dry. What the?! Service was typical of a buffet one so no comment. As long as we got our drinks refilled without asking, good enough.

So before I make this long and repetitive, unless you get your food comped here, or you don't want to leave the casino...then by all means. However, if you are coming here from elsewhere looking to eat at a buffet, I won't say DONT...but uhh....you know there are a lot of good places to eat out here.

It is kid friendly (but if you don't want the smoke smell since you do have to go through the casino then not so kid friendly) and stroller friendly.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"3.5 to 4+  Stars, maybe more.  Depending on if your Fav's here that buffet day.  Been here many times over the years. Lunch today awesome Beef Ribs, Brisket. Oxtail Stew. See my picture.

Dessert Stations here mind blowing. A buffet in itself. Kids Delish Heaven. Yummiest. Me...I'll need about 5 dessert Trips 

HAHA. It seems empty at the Rio Casino for gambling.


Read Yelp Elite's Rex M.'s review. For Foodie's Impression from the Heart.


 Every, Every, Every Trip to Vegas we will MUST eat here at the Orleans French Mkt Buffet least once. If for Nothing Else than to satisfy my huge Dessert Craving here"}
{"text":"Best value for a quality buffet. Champagne is included at the Sunday Brunch. Renovated and reopened on Sept 13 2017 with its new name, Medley Buffet, and contemporary decor."}
{"text":"3.45872 Stars.  This is by far the BEST of the ghetto (ahem) excuse me....economical casino buffets in town.  We get coupons here every once in a while and the champagne brunches and steak/seafood nights are decent but this is pretty much a place I would only go maybe every 3 months at best.  The BBQ station is probably my favorite."}
{"text":"Worth coming for breakfast if you can get it comped or deeply discounted. It's kind of annoying that they close the whole thing down between breakfast and lunch, but I'm not a huge buffet person, so this might be standard now. I think you need to be selective about what day/ meal you come here for, as some offerings are better than others. We came on a Friday and got here at 11, so we had to wait until noon for lunch.  They put bell peppers in everything and I'm allergic to them, so that limited what I could have. The barbeque brisket was a little tough, next time I'll try the ham. There will still a few breakfast offerings, but for the most part it was pretty meh. Couldn't find toast or even plain sliced bread, they had rolls to go with our omelettes. The server (I think his name was Alex) was very good though, so extra star for him."}
{"text":"Went here for my wife's Christmas party on the weekend.  Although they had a large selection of food, nothing here looked particularly appealing;  though, it probably didn't help that I wasn't feeling very well before I came here.  The food overall probably rated a two, but the service by the staff very attentive to everyone so the service was great, bumping the rating up a star."}
{"text":"There are better deals in other hotels/casino but this one is convenient and you can't ruin breakfast after all. Service is good, fruits are fresh and the breakfast buffet adequate."}
{"text":"You have to know what to go for here. If you fill yourself up with their bland pseudo-Italian/Mexican/Asian offerings you will be disappointed.

On the other hand, endless crayfish and beef ribs? Yes please.

There is also a wide selection of desserts."}
{"text":"Did I hear someone say ALL YOU CAN EAT PRIME RIB?!?!?!?! Yup Yup! You did!

This buffet is located inside the New Orleans casino. The price is a bit expensive (over $13) but if you sign up for a free B-connect membership, your meal admission is only $9.99! Need I repeat it? All You Can Eat Prime Rib for only $9.99!

I have to say the quality of the selections there is pretty good, considering how much you pay for your meal. I was pleasantly surprised at the Chinese section, since the stir-fried vegetables and eggplant dish was pretty delicious. Usually, in my experience, I usually avoid the Asian section when I go to buffets (except for sushi) since the food ends up tasting like Panda Express.

But other than that, I really did enjoy the dessert! They had ice cream flavors ranging from Vanilla, Coffee, Mango, and Peach. Also there were sorbet flavors such as Passion Fruit (My fav! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!), Lemon (another hit!), and Watermelon.

I definitely recommend this place, especially if you sign up for your B-connect membership before lining up at the buffet. It's worth it. You save AND you get to eat happily. :D"}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you are able to take down a lot of food. If I were able to post pictures, I would post one of the many pictures we took of 21 plates of empty crawfish shells on our table :D It was not a one man job, it took 3 guys and 1 girl. 

I didn't just eat the crawfish. Their many stations offer you a variety of ethnic foods ranging from Italian to Asian and Mexican. Their meat items would be among the best. I favored their grilled sausages (wow, I thought about that sentence to try avoiding any 2nd meanings...). The majority of their food was mediocre at best, but they have some jewels.

The service is pretty efficient here. They come by every so often to check on your status and to refill your drinks. For the most part, they are very nice except for one or two of them. Many of them do have a good sense of humor and had a laugh with us when they came to look at all the plates. A lot of the other patrons came by to take pictures of us and give us some encouragement.

The environment was pretty spacious. It gives you a lot of room to move around without having to run into people on accident like some other buffets. It was a comfortable setting, just don't look around too much to see what other people do with their food. It can become pretty bizarre.

Overall, this is a good place to go to with family and friends. There is plenty of food selections, so you'll be able to find something you enjoy with very little ease. People are overall pretty friendly here, so you won't feel uncomfortable much. If you love crawfish, just come here for that because that alone made it worth the money for us, as you can probably tell from my introduction. I believe lunch was around $8 and dinner around $16. It is definitely worth a visit. 

I gave this restaurant 3 stars because I judge establishments on overall quality, not just on the amount of food that I can eat. If I did that, almost any restaurant would get 5 stars. They do have some excellent food, but overall, there are some bumps. This is a very good 3-star establishment though that will most likely not let you down."}
{"text":"First things yes its good for kids... there is a play area for school age and an arcade room for teens, a movie theater also!! So that there since i havebmy 14 year old was a big plus. I dont play much so it was a good find. Now the buffet breakfast! Was bomb!! Loved the Mexican food section they need to add pozole for the hang over. The spice in the food was perfect."}
{"text":"It was edible. I came here with my mom and grand parents. they wanted to eat here. Think they had crab or something they wanted. It is not very memorable. I have eatin at several better buffets similarly priced. I have been to vegas too many times to like this place. But the food was average, service and atmosphere is the same. I rather eat at the orleans Coasta Cantina. Much better quality."}
{"text":"Since I stayed at The Orleans last weekend, I thought I would give this place a try. This is definitely one of the better casino buffets I've eaten at in Vegas, if not the best (I have to admit, the only buffets I've tried on the strip were at Excalibur's which was pretty bad and The Stardust which was terrible, the worst buffet I've ever had anywhere, even though that's a moot point now since it's no longer there. I also tried the much-hyped Carnival Buffet at The Rio a few years ago and thought for the money it was a rip-off).

The surroundings were nicer than average for a buffet and they had a tremendous variety of food. They have a deal for $21.00 in which you can eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner there. I only had lunch there once ($8.00), but because of the huge variety of items, I'm sure it would be no problem to eat all three meals there and never have a single item twice if you didn't want to. 

The quality of the food was above average for a buffet. There were a few things I tried I did not like, but there was more I liked than disliked. The beef back ribs, in fact, were by far the best I've had at any buffet and they had a braised oxtail stew which was very good, not as good as top quality homemade, but very good nevertheless, probably the single best item I've ever had at a buffet. The mashed potatoes, usually just fair or mediocre at most buffets, were also first rate.

The lines moved quickly and the service was good, although I couldn't understand why you couldn't just get your own water and napkins instead of having to get the attention of a server to do it for you. Also, there didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the order or location of the various food stations, i.e. the ribs were two or three stations from the American food station whereas it seems more logical they should have been next to each other. That's a minor thing, though.

In terms of overall value for what you get this place is an easy four stars, although I could not quite bring myself to give it five due to the items I did not care for and most of the stuff just being decent. If I ever go to The Orleans again, though, which is quite likely, I will definitely go to this place again."}
{"text":"I gave a 4 instead of 5 rating for the waitress not the food! She had a lousy attitude. 

We Always make it to the French Market Buffet! Very tasty selections. Over the years have tried many Vegas Buffets..Aria, MGM, Mirage (when it was Great b4 Cravings) Bellagio, Caesar Palace on and on!

But we never leave Vegas without eating here. Sunday February 12th we tried their Sunday Brunch! OMG delicious! I never made it to the pancakes I came for! But the made to order Omelet and the Hush puppy Fried Shrimp were Ridiculously Fantastic....should have eaten more of them!"}
{"text":"Well ... Went to vegas this weekend and always try to hit this buffet , but this trip the buffet went south. We went for the breakfast/brunch and were very hungry. The food was sub par to say the least ... Lousy flavor , bland. 

The eggs benedict went right into the trash after the first bite . The corned beef hash was good , as were the bisquits and gravy , but that is where it stopped ... Everything else was horrid. 

The link sausages tasted very strange and were pushed away from me. 
I used to fatten up here and hit the dessert bar BUT after chewing on muck , i passed on dessert ( which i never do ! ). My appetite for later was ruined as i spent most of the day and evening grasping the sides of the toilet with fire ass ! 

Although i am kinda pissed , i hope in the future there is more care in the way food is made ....."}
{"text":"Gluten Free Buffet! Sweet! Paper placemat has gluten free items listed on it right at table so you can preview the available menu items. You can order your own gluten free pizza...although I didn't care for the crust. For those who are truly gluten free, guess what? The staff is KNOWLEDGEABLE ( imagine that!), about the ingredients in the food!

Only four stars because of pizza crust...hopefully they find a better alternative as mine fell apart and I had to eat it with a fork but the toppings were great!"}
{"text":"This is for the Breakfast buffet. 

I'm not a fan of the all you can eat, and this one reminded my why. 

Everything on my plate was cold and tasteless. Next time my family wants breakfast, we will go down the street to Jack in the box."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Friday night crab and prime rib.. The buffet has a large variety of dishes. No long lines or overcrowding. Will return again.."}
{"text":"A friend who is a Veteran wanted to go here for Veterans Day and although it would not have been my first choice I obliged. The lines were long and the place was packed but the line did move along quickly and when inside Management was everywhere helping to clear tables and seat people ( nice to see ). The food is not above average but it is good and all stations were kept filled. I had broasted chicken, sweet potato and salad and all were fresh and tasty. My guest was happy with everything and I think he tried everything !! The highlight however was not the food but seeing so many of our military in uniform. I'm glad I went."}
{"text":"First meal of the day at Vegas and its breakfast.. I get tons of breakfast foods; eggs, bacon, waffles,donuts, ham, and hash browns. I decide to get a omelet with everything on it including the shrimp. The next few hours I get sick and my stomach is churning like threes no tomorrow. Everyone was fine besides me and I find out I am only the person that got an omelet with shrimp. So it has to be that that got me sick. All around the food was really bland or salty. I was stuffed at the end but who isn't at a buffet. You gotta get your moneys worth. Anyways I would've gave it a 3 star but since I got sick it looses both star and only is left with 1. Too bad."}
{"text":"Im very impressed with the renovation and opening of the new Medley Buffet at the Orleans Hotel/Casino. It had been awhile since I had dined at the Orleans and I was excited to try out the new digs.

Dinner buffet is 20.99 and 18.99 if you have a Boyd gaming card.

The selection is endless! You can have anything from prime rib to veal parmesan and yes...shrimp scampi. I was in the mood for mexican and they offered a taco station, enchilada's, chili releno, street corn and an entire fresh salsa bar with delicious chips. Plus so much more.
I did try the steamed crawfish because I have a weakness for shellfish. They were really good but wasn't in the mood for all that crack a'lacking and messiness.

After dinner we decided to try the desert area. Impressive Boyd Group!
So much to choose from..bread pudding, cobbler, carrot cake, pies, fresh baked cookies and my favorite \"The Ice Cream Parlor\" This is not an ice cream station its a full size ice cream store! Not some soft freeze ice cream that squirts out of a machine..but endless flavors where an employee scoops it out for you and puts on a cone or a dish. Its kind of hard to describe, you will just have to go see for yourself. I thought it was really cool.

For the price this buffet is worth it! I certainly couldn't eat more than what I had, but if I had a big stomach I would've tried more things!
Boyd Group did good with this buffet as the other Boyd properties have mediocre buffets. 

I definitely recommend if you want an extensive selection of food from around the world and endless deserts. And the renovation is very elegant and classy."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5       Price: 5/5        Service: 3/5     Ambience: 3/5

This buffet is a little far from the Strip, but they offer cheap meals with pretty great taste! We came for the breakfast, and there was a wide selection including Italian(pizza, lasagna ), Mexican(tacos, enchiladas, beans), Chinese(fried rice, pot stickers, sweat and sour chicken), omelette station, American (biscuits and gravy, french toast, waffles, bacon, egg, fish and chips, potatoes), Carving (ham, brisket, ribs), salad bar, and dessert(pies, cakes, bread pudding, ice cream, cookies). Overall very worth the price and I enjoyed the meal.

Pricing 
Breakfast : $9.99
Lunch: $11.99
Dinner : $ 18.99"}
{"text":"New remodel but same type of food.  Overpriced breakfast (11.99, 9.99 with card).  Food was cold.  Cold eggs, cold gravy, cold ham.  Only good item was the bread pudding.  Go around the corner to Palms or even The Orleans sister property (Gold Coast) for better food or pricing."}
{"text":"I sincerely hope some manager of Orleans Casino or Boyd Gambling reads reviews cause they need to. I have been going to Orleans Casino for almost as long as it has existed. Great hotel, great pool, great everything despite it being off the strip. Best has been the buffet. It's was inexpensive and good. The locals loved it. Now with a new name and new look called Medley Buffet, it's the same food but much more expensive. Not a good idea. And if management reads this, your American flag flying above the entrance is totally torn up. Replace it please"}
{"text":"THIS BUFFET was a total waste of $20 it included DRY MEAT, sloppy shrimp scampi, most of the food was uneatable !!!!! I got full off eating vegetable spring rolls and salad because it was the only thing I could stomach. Not to mention I didn't come on Seafood night and I was craving crab kings. The ice cream was good and the
Fruit was fresh but I would Never Ever eat @ THE FRENCH MARKET BUFFET AGAIN. People must be writing fake reviews to gives this dump 4 or 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Excellent food for a very good price. This was our first time here and we will be returning. $57 for a party of 5 on a monday is not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Horrible.  Food was terrible, service was terrible.  If you want a refill on your coffee, better order two.  Upside - it was cheap."}
{"text":"For myself I'm kinda a picky eater but French Market Buffet in Orleans Casino blew my expectations. Most of these cooks in each stations from Asian to Italian and Mexican makes Table Mountain and  Chuckchansi buffet very forgettable. Also their server was really efficient and nice refilling my drinks. Every stations was really good it wasn't bland, it had the right amount of sodium the only thing I didn't like was their seafood soup with tomatoe sauce and their \"dirty rice\" dish. They even have BBQ beef ribs along with prime roast beef you can't beat that for only under $20.00 for AYCE. The buffet is nothing fancy but they have decent foods and good service also their desert slections is awesome so be sure to leave room for that. If you're complaining about paying under $20.00 for decent AYCE buffet I suggest you shut up and go to McDonald's or Burger King for you cheapskates."}
{"text":"When I came into this buffet, I thought it must be just as good as the Ports O'Call Buffet at Gold Coast because of the set up and it did offer the same foods. However, I was wrong. French Market Buffet was just alright. I found a couple things I could eat, but overall, this place was a dud. I found myself placing a lot of salt and pepper on my plate just to give my meal a little bit of flavor. They are definitely other places to go for off the Strip buffets."}
{"text":"No French food here but the Mexican food was great! Hubby went for a second serving of Menudo!"}
{"text":"It's not bad for the price. Lots of different choices, from around the world, including desserts. I always eat too much whenever I eat here. Bring your big appetite, Because there is so many choices. There is quite often a line, so be ready for that. It is inside the Orleans Hotel and Casino, if you're a guest here you get a discount on your meal here."}
{"text":"I ate here for breakfast on Saturday. It was only $8.99 including drinks. I expected the worst but suprisingly, I enjoyed the food here. The bacon was crisp, the mexican sausage was especially juicy and you can't go wrong with the biscuits and gravy. There was also an omellete bar. It's a steal at $8.99."}
{"text":"My father just stayed at the Orleans for the past week and we had breakfast here most mornings and dinner one evening. I would say the breakfast is the best value (8.99 with players card) but dinner was still pretty good. If it's a busy weekend prepare to wait in line especially in the morning but they do keep things moving along fairly quick. Drink service can be a bit slow to get to you but it was very busy the times I was there over the week and the servers had many tables."}
{"text":"One of the worst buffets in Vegas. It's tiny and their staff is so slow. I'm a local and decided to try their shrimp and steak night. When I went to get some \"steak\", they cut off a paper-thin slice so I asked for 2, and she refused stating, \"one slice per customer.\" Really? One paper-thin slice then wait in a line for another 10mins for a second paper-thin slice? On my second trip to the buffet, hoping that maybe their other dishes were palatable, I walk back to my table and the bus-people have completely cleared it off. Our drinks were there and our receipt was still in the little holder indicating people were sitting there. So we had to sit there with our food, waiting for 3mins for a new set of silverware and drinks. Most of the food is way over cooked and the deserts are mediocre. Pass"}
{"text":"For the price you pay, this buffet is a good deal.  :)  It's $12 for lunch, or $1 off with a club card, and you get a nice variety of food.  The best section for me is the Cajun section with the smoked ribs and the beef ribs and the gumbo, its all pretty good.  I also actually thought their sushi was pretty descent for a buffet, I have ate sushi at probably about 50 buffets and I thought it actually tasted pretty good, it was a bit dry, but it was still fairly fresh and tasted like sushi, the problem I have with most buffet sushi is it just does not taste like Sushi, not even at Asian Buffet restaurants. 

The sweet and sour pork was surprisingly good, the sauce was separate which was nice so the food was not at all soggy.  :) The craw fish is very tasty and well-cooked, love craw fish those alone are 5stars, and they also have a chocolate fountain, for dinner at least (can't remember if it's there for lunch too)!

Overall, for the price, I think it's pretty damn good.  I have been to a lot of Vegas Buffets and I would rate this higher than many of the buffets on the strip that cost 5-10 dollars more.  The staff was friendly, the food was pretty fresh considering they were pretty dead, and I nothing was poor quality, even if not all the dishes are exceptional, they are at least decent.

God Bless ~Amy"}
{"text":"First time here since the remodel...it's like ten times better in execution than the redo of the Palms Casino buffet.... Here it's Old Vegas....the food looks good and actually tastes EXCELLENT! And the line servers are happy  folks and actually want to talk to you if you make eye  contact...  went on a Tuesday and there's definitely price value for what I paid.... Crepes, oxtail stew, Chinese roast duck, prime rib anyways you want it, bbq beef ribs...it's all here"}
{"text":"So-so food. But at Sunday Brunch I was surprised to find the roast beef tender and the gravy without clumps of gook....even more surprising were the mashed potatoes being moist and flavorful and not the usual pasty glop.
French fries were crispy hot and tasty... but then again we arrived at the start of Brunch---9 am....Chinese food station--tasteless---looks cute until you bite into it.
....of course the service staff are always top notch to us."}
{"text":"Best selection of food ..bbq is amazing and a variety for every taste. Chocolate fountain too..would recccomend."}
{"text":"For $21 buffet, it's really not too shabby at all.  The variety of food and quality is worthy of another trip.  We came on Friday night, which was steak & shrimp night.  From what I could gather, there is no more seafood night.

There were so much shrimp dishes- butterflied shrimp, shrimp over ice, popcorn shrimp, deep fried shrimp, shrimp linguini, and a few more shrimp dishes in sauces and broth.  I'm starting to sound like Bubba Gump, so you get my drift.  The variety of soup like clam chowder, sweet & spicy, menudo and even pho were all represented with a few more that I can't quite remember. The pork ribs, beef ribs, the variety of meats on the carving board will satiate any carnivore eating habits. 

This is our first time and we were so impressed with the clean décor, excellent service that was provided throughout the floor.  

Stay for the gelato, the bite-size dessert and if you could believe it, their decaf Folgers coffee was pretty darn good.  To each's own, this place was a pleasant surprise for a buffet."}
{"text":"This may be one of the better Vegas buffets off the strip. A variety of foods such as seafood, Mexican, Chinese, Italian, and Mongolian. 

I had a little bit of everything but my favorite was they're carne asada and seafood enchiladas. Mixed with some salsa, guacamole and sour cream. Oh boy! 

Two salad bars, but who eats salad in Vegas? 

Very big selection of desserts! Not only ice cream and pies, but gelato! That really surprised me. 

Awesome place to eat if you're at The Orleans."}
{"text":"Price was good for what you get.
Did not have to wait in line long only 17 mins., place was already full.
I especially enjoyed the German food. You could tell a lot of time and thought was put into these dishes at the Hofbrau station.
The Wait service met my every needs, I never had to ask for anything.
Very tasty and delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite cheap buffet in Vegas! It's a really good deal to eat here and good food. There is a wide selection of food. The line can get long but not long as it does on The Strip or at the Rio. I think the food here is much better than at the Rio buffet. Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"HELL YEAH I know I came out weighing more but who cares, the food was lick my plate good ... I was playing with my B connected players card and thus it made this awesome meal for fahhhhhfreeeeee.. Now good food that is also free is a winner any day in my book!!!"}
{"text":"Combination of food, price and service makes this buffet worthwhile.  Nice variety of selection.  Asian, Mexican, American, Southern, and Italian.  I particularly liked the Char Sui and Smoked spare ribs, as well as the desserts.  We also got a very pleasant surprise with the 2 for 1 promotion."}
{"text":"Good value. Decent food. Adequate variety.   We drove out from downtown (about 20 minutes).  The casino and the buffet are very open, meaning not cramped, as many are in the more popular places.  The property is nicely decorated and welcoming.  At a reasonable price, the buffet was OK, but not outstanding."}
{"text":"First let me qualify this it $14.99 lunch.  Luke warm, Bland food.  Selection was meh, desert table a waste of time -70% empty. Service was sssllloooowww. Maybe it was to limit the amount of drink? Maybe they were understaffed due to all the cheerleaders? Regardless - not an enjoyable or tasty experience I would repeat."}
{"text":"Living in Las Vegas, I've been to quite a few buffets at both the big hotels and Station Casinos. This one is definitely one of your best deals (about $16.99 for dinner, $3 discount with BConnected card) for the mid-priced buffets. The prime rib was excellent, and the other offerings included Mexican, Asian, Mongolian, pasta station, delicious dessert station."}
