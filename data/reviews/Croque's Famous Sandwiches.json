{"text":"Tucked within an office building, I would have never learned about Croque if my friend had not suggested it. We came during peak lunch hour, and being that we were the only diners there (often a warning sign to me), I was a lil weary of how good the food would be. Yet, I wholly enjoyed my Soperssata cold sandwich (reminiscent of Genoa Salami) that featured large slabs of feta (I think this place is BIG on feta!) and a tasty basil-pesto spread. My friend got the Croque Special Sandwich...def. want to try next time I visit!   Service was fast and what you expect from a deli-like place (read: nothing special). Sandwiches are served on what appears to be like a chopping board. All sandwiches range from $6-8. Will return! In addition, they have a N. Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here for quite some time, hidden along a side street with office buildings surrounding this restaurant. It's been under new management for the past year or two.  My company orders lunch from here quite frequently as they do deliver to our office and, being so hot here in the summers, they think it's worth to have the lunches delivered.  To me, it just so, so.  I've tried about 4 items on the menu and I'll have to be really hungry to order something from here.    What I had: Turkey club tortilla wrap.   I've tried this sandwich the way it should be made but the french bread consumed the turkey and bacon, so I thought I would have them make it in a wrap. Like I said, it's just so, so, and for the price they charge, it wasn't a very big wrap ($7.75)  Very small menu, their menu consists of Salads (7 different varieties), Wraps (3 items), Breakfast (3 items), couple of items from France, Italy and America (Philly Steak, Roast Beef, Turkey Club).    I've had better for the prices they charge (average price $8), and their portions are not large, but if you're hungry enough and you don't want to go out in the heat, it's ok."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I've tried many of the items on the menu and have not been disappointed yet. It's a little pricier than some places, but you get what you pay for! Working in the same office complex it's convenient and easy. I prefer their sandwiches rather than the salads, but then they are known for their sandwiches. You have to have the garlic sauce. It's the best!!"}
