{"text":"Définitivement le meilleur resto de déjeuner/brunch de Saint-Jean! La nourriture est toujours excellente, chaude et de bonne qualité. Mention spéciale pour les patates déjeuner, qui sont les meilleures que j'aie jamais mangées. J'aime aussi beaucoup les cocktails de fruits frais, dont le nectar d'amour. Les prix sont très bons et le service est rapide et courtois. Honnêtement, il n'y a absolument rien à redire; j'y vais très (trop!) souvent."}
{"text":"Oh my this is the best breakfast place I have ever been to! It is ALWAYS packed which says a lot about how good their food is. I keep coming back and am always happy and satisfied with my breakfast. A great way to start the day.  I often get the 1 egg breakfast which comes with toast, potatoes, and fresh fruit, all that food for only $3.50! Wow! Their potatoes are to die for! I have never had potatoes that good! This is the reason I keep coming back.   Their crepes are delicious too!   Don't be dis-encouraged if you see a line, it goes quickly, so we've rarely had to wait more than 10 mins. I've not had to wait that long after ordering and plus the wait staff are always real friendly.   I have tried other breakfast places in Quebec, none of them aren't even as good as this place."}
{"text":"I don't know why there aren't more reviews but this is quality food for amazing prices!This is a popular place and there are sometimes long lines but the lines go quick!  They have the REAL maple syrup & Canadian cheese & sucre a la creme here! It's definitely worth waiting for! We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"THE BEST breakfast ever! I dunno what they do to the food but it is still my fav! I've been here a few times over the past 10 years or so and each time it doesn't disappoint! My favourite is the French toast with fruit. Also be sure you get the house potatoes--they are delicious!!!"}
{"text":"large open dining room - above average for the price - busy Sat morning and yet great food at my table in less than 5 minutes! As expected a bit noisy but very enjoyable meal"}
{"text":"I had the spinach omelette, potatoes, french toast, and toast.  A good choice if you're a vegetarian.  I came hungry and left FULL!  Good food and good service."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast place! We came on a busy Saturday morning and while there was a pretty long line, everyone was seated within 5-10 minutes.  The food was really good value, I'd say about 90% of the menu is under $10. The plates were very generous and based on the tables around us, it seems everything on the menu comes with toast. In all, the taste was very good too. Coffee is on your table in a nice thermal pot, I think it keeps the service smoother since they don't have to bring everyone coffee all the time.  It's a nice big dining room and everything was running really smoothly from the kitchen to the service."}
