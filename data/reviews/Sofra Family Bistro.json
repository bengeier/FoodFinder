{"text":"Service is always mixed up, erratic, and sometimes outright rude. I generally go here for breakfast. They don't seem to be super thrilled about seeing you. Orders are often mixed up and/or late in coming to you. One of the ladies who looks like the older of two sisters who works there has a tendency to bang your food down on your table and walk away. Don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"I can't even say how much I loved going here. I ordered to go but while I waited had a glass of Malbec sitting outside. The food was SO good and everyone that worked there was super nice. The lady at the front desk was the sweetest thing ever. Every time I come to this town, I will go here."}
{"text":"Your typical American family diner with all-American food items on the menu, which is just average tasting. Great service and very friendly staff. Booth and table seating available, suitable space for larger groups."}
{"text":"We had the Albanian omelette and a lamb/beef burger.  Without knowing anything about the restaurant prior to our visit, we hought this might be a standard American bistro.  It was a pleasant surprise to have some authentic regional specialties like fresh Ivar, chivape sausage, and kaymak.  Service was quick and very good."}
{"text":"We love this place for breakfasts and dinner.  Best item on the menu is the Albanian quebabs, which are huge! They are a beef / lamb mix, so if you are like me and can't enjoy half of what is on a breakfast menu usually it is a great choice,  for dinner, You get six sausages and a ton of fries. You also get soup or salad. We usually order the salad, which isn't too special, but is good. Wednesdays are free sangria nights when you order from the dinner menu.

The only reason I don't give it five stars is because sometimes the service is hit or miss. When it is the owner, they are fantastic, but the past couple of times it has been general waitstaff, one girl was dressed so inappropriately that my husband couldn't even look at her. 

The two outdoor tables do get busy in the summer, and I do find myself wishing there are more.

One thing to mention is don't go in late. We once went at 8:30 and they wouldn't seat us. Annoying, but as we have been back so many other times and enjoyed it, not worries."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast at Sofra and the food was amazing. Can miss the pumpkin pancakes. Good and spicy Bloody Mary! Wait staff was fun and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Staff here is delightful! Always treat me like family and are very kind. The food is amazing. I just finished the best bowl of tomato bisque I've ever had. The sea food linguine is so delicious! It's easy to taste the high quality ingredients used in their tactfully constructed recipes.  If you want a wonderful dining experience any time of day Sofra is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Eh. Forgetable. I went for brunch and had a little bit better than ok salmon sandwhich, with a little bit less than ok service. Decor is eh. Not bad, but I wouldn't pick it over any of the neighboring restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I had brunch there last weekend and was in food heaven. I have a rule that I never order any dish that I can make myself, so I immediately gravitated to the Albanian sausage dishes. After all, where else in Dane County can you get Albanian sausage. I asked if the could add it to the Mediterranean Scrambler since my husband was getting the skillet and the waitress was very accommodating. It was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! If you love sausage, this stuff will blow your mind. The copious amounts of fresh veggies didn't hurt either. With the included toast, it was really filling and a great value.

Filling or not - this brunch so we had to have dessert:) We topped our already glorious meal off with their Black Cherry Crepes. They have this soft cream cheese filling in them that is just amazing. I ate as slowly as I could because I didn't want it to end.

I know others have complained about some of the other dishes, but reviews I read on other sites talked about how great it was. I guess it's all about your personal taste. I just wish the ENTIRE menu was Albanian so that there was more unique stuff to choose from. My husband and I were both thrilled and can't wait to try some of their Albanian dinners. 

For anyone interested in their brunch, it's served Saturday and Sunday and was pretty busy, but the place is big, so I didn't see anyone wait for a table longer than a few minutes."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while searching for a place to eat for breakfast. We were seated within minutes, which was nice. All five of us squeezed into a corner booth and were quickly asked if we wanted coffee. My daughter wanted espresso, which she thought she saw.. only to be told 'we only serve turkish coffee' as tge waitress rolled her eyes and walked away. There was something odd about her which was distracting, but besides this, the food was very good and it was clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"Always great food and service. Have had the hummus plate a number of times - great for a take out dish on the way home from work."}
{"text":"Friends recommended dinner here and we came on Friday night.  It was wonderful!  We had the Mixed Grill Platter for Two.  It had Lamb Chops, Chicken Skewers, Albanian Sausages, Dolma, Hummus, Red potatoes & Fresh zucchini.  The Albanian Sausages are lamb and hamburger made from the family recipe without casings and very tasty. The lamb was excellent.  The zucchini and petite sweet peppers were grilled and wonderful.  All in all, it was a great evening!"}
{"text":"Nice breakfast/brunch spot in quaint Middleton. Outdoor tables available. Our party had a variety of breakfast plates and we loved them all. Most notably was the house made Albanian sausage. It seemed like the restaurant took a lot of pride in their sausage - AS WELL THEY SHOULD!! It was amazing!  The flavors, especially when paired with some salt and chili flakes was very tasty. 
They do a good Turkish coffee as well and the waitress we had was engaging and pleasant. 
Back to the sausage - it was incredible. A mix of beef and lamb the flavor was made for breakfast and coffee, so good!"}
{"text":"Albanian wedding is fantastic although recently they changed their bowl sizes. What was a full portion of the soup before, now is a lot smaller (still larger than a cup). 
First time I ordered their grilled beef skewers, asking specifically for it to be well done, they brought it BLOODY!! Asked to fix it and they brought it completely charred black! In the end I lost all appetite to eat anything. 
Today we went again and there was only one couple beside us. So asked if we could be seated by the window. The waitress responded that those seats are only for larger groups and sat us across. As we set there for over half hour seats by the window were filled by single couples. Yes there was another waitress seating people but shouldn't waitresses be on the same page with each other? 
Even with all of the above mentioned, most of the food is great but that's the only reason we've been returning."}
{"text":"Went to Sofra for brunch and was underwhelmed.  Scrambled eggs came out looking like an over cooked omelet, Albanian sausage was alright, Bloody Mary was middling to not great.  Great ambiance and nice severs but honestly the food was so lacking that I doubt we will be back"}
{"text":"Stopped here first time for an early  lunch today and loved it! Nice, relaxed atmosphere , although the chairs are old and not very comfortable, and the single tables are very small (which is why i  gave it 4, instead of 5, stars). But the food is excellent. I got the gyro and it was really good. Their feta cheese is amazing - reminded me of the incredible feta cheese that I experienced over 40 years ago when I lived in Massachusetts near an ethnically Greek community. My husband had the Albanian sausage and really enjoyed it. I tasted it as well and was fascinated by the intriguing mix of flavors. We are definitely returning!"}
{"text":"I always liked the Bavarian Cafe, so I was suspicious by the upgrade and name change, until I stopped by for breakfast. Their omelet and crepe selections are fantastic and almost too much food that early in the morning. Other than spicy up their menu, they re-did their booths, tables, and a few other aesthetic touches, but Sofra still has the same look and feel that I've enjoyed in the past."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service! The vegetarian platter is delicious with fresh pita, roasted veggies, home made hummus, vegetarian Dolmades and goat cheese! 2nd time here and love it!"}
{"text":"It was soooo much better before they changed the name! Way to pricey now for what you get. Menu turned more upscale. The old Bavarian was a much better place."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on Saturday night.  It was the night before Easter so there were not many customers which meant our service was fantastic and we were served super quick!  I had the mojito which they made less sweet for me...nailed it!  We started with the dolmas, which were good but kind of spendy for 4 small stuffed grape leaves.  It also came with this amazing olive bread that was grilled.  Then we both had soup.  My husband had the tomato bisque which was super delicious and I had the Albanian wedding soup.  It had great flavor but the noodles were so over cooked they turned to complete mush when they kit your mouth, that was a slight disappointment. I would like to try it again to see if the noodles were less cooked if it would be better.  My husband ordered the beef tenderloin skewers, which were over cooked and had a funny taste to me, but he thought they were fine.  I ordered the rotisserie chicken, it came with roasted vegetables, and lemon oregano potatoes and this was amazing.  It was a huge portion for under $13.00 and worth every penny.  We want to give this place another try and next time we might split this dish so we can try a few more appetizers and perhaps a dessert. So overall it was good but there is room for improvement."}
{"text":"The food was very mediocre. The ingredients were fresh but food was lacking in creativity and flavor.

Service was nice but not the best. Restaurant needs a makeover and prices seemed a little high for what you get.

Better than a chain but not worth 4 stars."}
{"text":"Fantastic!

I went here on 4/5/14 for lunch with my husband. We had coffee to start, which was delicious. They use their own blend that's locally roasted. It was just what we needed  for a mid-morning pick me up. 

My husband ordered eggs, toast, and their own (delicious) Albanian sausage. He liked his meal a lot, but my meal stole the show. I ordered the Beef Skewers entree which consisted of steak tenderloin medallions seasoned with Mediterranean spices and served on steel skewers. The steak was served with grilled zucchini slices, homemade yogurt-dill sauce, a delicious veggie-rice pilaf, and a side of homemade hummus.

 Where do I begin with my praise? 

First of all, the beef was **tender**, which was my biggest concern when I ordered. They asked me how I wanted the beef cooked (medium rare), and then delivered me perfectly seasoned beef with a perfectly pink medium rare center. The yogurt-dill sauce was great, and I used it as a dip for my meat. The zucchini was not mushy and had cute grill marks on it. I don't love zucchini, but I was able to eat a few pieces of it, which is a true testament to how well it was prepared. The hummus was awesome too...except  that the hummus was sort of on its own, so I ordered a side of pita to dip in it. The pita was warm and crunchy around the edges when it was served, and it was the perfect complement to the rich and garlicky hummus.

On top of the excellent food, service was extremely friendly, prompt, and the waitress tasked with refilling water and coffee was on her game. Our glasses never went empty for more than 10 seconds before she was back with a refill. This was on a Saturday morning after we waited for 5 minutes for a seat. The place was pretty much at capacity, but the service was still top-notch.

The only negative in my eyes was that the menu is a bit pricey, and the portions are a little on the small side. I've never been the type of diner to equate large portions with a good restaurant experience, and I have a normal to small appetite anyway, so it wasn't a problem with me. However, a big burly man might have an issue with portion size. I also feel the price reflects the quality of the food, and the old addage \"you get what you pay for\" holds true. Finally, it's only a couple dollars more expensive than going to someplace like Perkins, and it is 100000000 times better in every way!

Next time you want to go out for lunch or dinner, give Sofra a try. It's awesome and I guarantee you'll have a great experience there."}
{"text":"This is one place I really miss since moving away from Middleton.  A great variety of Albanian/Greek food. I ate there at least once a week and never had a meal I was disappointed with. They  always had  great, homemade soup choices and interesting specials."}
{"text":"If the food wasn't so cheesy (i mean literally) I would rate it 4.5 but then again, i don't really have the option anyways, ;-) 

Great little town next to Madison - my boyfriend n I were on road trip and didn't wanna eat @ any chains - so we took the map of Madison area and threw a dart @ it. It landed on Middleton and so did we... 

Bavaria Cafe is nicely decorated and have some yummy cakes and pastries you must try to believe. We got chicken quesdillas and it was more cheese then chicken/vegs. Not a fan of that - I stuck to the carrot cake and let my bf finish the quesadilla. He has no complaints. 

Corona for $3.25! Also try the spotted cow. ;-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for something different after shopping in Middleton and stumbled upon Sofra Bistro. We are glad we did. The atmosphere is sweet and the service is good. The menu is interesting; it was nice to have choices that we don't get everywhere else. On the other hand, I am only moderate in my food adventuresomeness, and I was not scared off by the menu choices. Meals come with freshly baked olive bread, which is delicious, and an Albanian-style chicken noodle soup that is a little creamy and has a touch of lemon. I had the beef skewer dinner, and that brought the only negative of the meal: my beef was so tough I couldn't eat it. After spitting three pieces into my napkin and attempting to cut into several more, I gave up. The server was accommodating and offered to bring me something else, but I chose to eat the vegetables, rice, and hummus on my plate and leave it at that. As a result, my meal price was reduced by over half. My husband's lamb chop was delicious. I think I just ordered the wrong thing. We will go back and I will expect to have a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"I have breakfast at Sofra about once a month. 

On Tuesday morning the weather was nice so I walked over. 

I usually have the eggs Benedict or eggs florentine with a side order of the spicy Albanian sausages. If I'm really hungry I'll have crepes for desert. 

This time I had eggs Benedict and sausage and the black cherry crepes. Breakfast was excellent, and the service was prompt and friendly. Well recommended."}
{"text":"The vegetable plate, albeit kind of expensive, is absolutely delicious and highly recommended.

I can't speak much for the rest of the menu. I ordered the Salad Nicoise and thought, hmm, I can make a much better salad dressing at home, with olive oil and lemon juice - so I took the rest home with me. With thoughts like that, why bother to go out and eat?"}
{"text":"We love Sofra!!!! When we feel like going out to breakfast or brunch, we always go to Sofra! Never any complaints and we always get in and out within 30-40 minutes."}
{"text":"My first time in the Madison WI area and I was looking for a Albanian restaurant and was not disappointed one bit.  Food was outstanding as well as the service. I would recommend this place to all and I will be there again (like next week)."}
{"text":"The albanian sausage was a pleasant surprise.  Solid breakfast at a good price with friendly staff.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Just ate at Sofra for the first time in a couple years, I think. It was delicious and the service was as good as I remember. In years past I cannot say the food was more than just average, but the dish I had today was something I will definitely go back for.

At my dining companion's recommendation, I ordered the Albanian Qebap (Sausages) - All-natural, homemade lamb and beef sausages, grilled and served with scrambled eggs and homemade potatoes, skillet style. The sausages had a sweet taste with a hint of something familiar that I could not identify (old age). Normally they are served with fries and Shephard's salad, which my friend had (his usual when he eats here). Great value for the portion. Cost us $15 for lunch after tax/before tip.

Service was very friendly and attentive. It was great sitting out on the sidewalk. We interacted with many neighbors and friendly faces walking by. Cannot wait to go back"}
{"text":"Except for the Albanian sausage, was very unimpressed by the brunch here.

Albanian sausage and eggs: pretty good, based on the sausage and eggs
Eggs Florentine: over cooked eggs, broken hollandaise, not super pleasant
Black cherry crepe: overly crisp and too sweet, both in terms of the preserved cherries and the cream inside
Turkish coffee: mostly grounds, but came with a piece of Turkish delight

Ambiance and service were also mediocre at best. Unfortunately, not with the visit."}
{"text":"I had been eager to try this place out, wanting to support a local place. First of all, the breakfast menu threw me off as a Mediterranean joint. The ambiance was mediocre--there was pop music playing and it just seemed like a boring diner. My waitress looked like it was torture for her to be there and was not very welcoming. I ordered the salmon steak and it was meh. The salmon was undercooked, the rice tasted bland, and the only \"vegetables\" I got were grilled zucchini. This was not worth $13 for lunch. I don't plan on ever going here again."}
{"text":"I think every time I come here I accidentally order the same thing, but it's so good! To start, dolmas and raki; lamb chops with grilled zucchini and potatoes for the main course; and flan to complete it (I'd probably add Turkish coffee, but that might be a bit much caffeine in the evening). Yum!"}
{"text":"Looking for a nice place to eat prior to my afternoon customer meetings. Discovered this place and decided to give it a try. The atmosphere is excellent, the food was good and the service was pleasant. My food was the Rueben which was very good with fries on the side which were good. Didn't like my soup choices but I am sure they are good. Coffee was good and strong. My server; Brooke, provided great hospitality with a smile.  Overall, I appreciated my experience and will be back for lunch when I am again visiting this part of town again."}
{"text":"\"This place is AMAZING!\" is the quote from my discerning mother: \"Unbelievable!\"

What makes this place so special is the hard-working owners. They keep their restaurant perfectly clean. They offer several healthy Mediterranean dishes and homemade soups while also doing a great job on deluxe burgers and fries.

They are open for all three meals and impart their high standard for excellence at each one."}
{"text":"Stopped by for Balkan Night a few weeks ago, which was a special event, so I can't really comment on the everyday Sofra experience-- but Balkan Night was really a blast. Live music, dancing, and everyone from the owners to the waitstaff to the customers all were having a fantastic time."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Sunday - I made a reservation and our party of 3 were seated within 5 minutes of getting there. The interior is cute, nothing extraordinary but it feels pretty cozy. Our drink order was taken pretty quickly too once we sat down. Good coffee - however I wish they would have brought some cream with it. I'm not a fan of the room temperature cream packets that have been sitting on the table for god knows how long.

We also didn't have to wait long for our food. I ordered a Breakfast Quesadilla with a side order of hash browns. The quesadilla was yummy. Full of cheese, eggs and Chorizo. It was still crisp which I appreciated (sometimes quesadillas can get pretty soggy). My meal came with fresh fruit and salsa and sour cream on the side. The hash browns were also tasty. A little under-seasoned, but nothing a little table salt and pepper can't fix! 

Price was a little high for what you get. But the food was good, so we'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late breakfast. I started with a cinnamon roll. It was fresh and soft, it was loaded with real cinnamon, and the icing/drizzle was perfectly sweetened. Overall, one of the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had. I ordered the Albanian Sausage Scramble for my main meal. It felt light for a sausage scramble. I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Sofra and I have to say it was a huge hit. We were seated immediately, even on a busy Friday night, and our server was prompt and attentive. The menu was short but tantalizing; I wanted to try nearly every item and our server's descriptions of the few we had narrowed it down to made it even more difficult to choose!

My husband had the Albanian Qebap platter and he thought it was out of this world delicious. Fantastic especially for meatlovers. I had the chicken medeira plate and it was mouthwateringly delicious. 

We had the best service we have had in a long time -- even though our server was new (only been there a week) and was quite busy, he took the time to make conversation with us, check in regularly, and go above and beyond our expectations. 

The only reason I am giving this a 4 instead of 5 is because the atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired. Kind of bland ambiance with an awkward host station that had no seating for waiting patrons. Other than that, it was fantastic. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sofra is a great breakfast or brunch place in the heart of Middleton. My family and I have been regular breakfast customers for many years. 

The breakfast and brunch offerings are fantastic. Generous portions and appropriately priced. Your coffee mug is never left empty, and their special omelettes are, without exception, delicious. The wait staff are always friendly, and always happy to answer any questions. You're never hurried through a meal.

I wouldn't recommend Sofra for dinner, and I wouldn't sit in the basement. I've been once for dinner and been sat in the basement twice. The dinner I had was a chicken meal, but unfortunately my chicken was badly undercooked. Everyone else at the table had a decent meal but felt it was overpriced for what they received. Being in the basement means that the waitstaff have to keep trudging up and down the stairs for orders, and you don't receive anywhere near the same level of service as you do on the main floor. 

That being said, I would give Sofra a 5* review for breakfast and brunch, hence it's high rating from me.  

Do NOT miss their Albanian Qebap (lamb and beef homemade sausages), and ask the wait staff to show you how to season them. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night and had one of the best fish that I have ever had and it was unlimited! Definitely recommend this restaurant for all types of people. Can't wait for my next trip back to Sofra."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Waitress needs people skills lessons.  Slow and neglected service with 4 tables and 2 waitresses.  Forgot to bring second beer, after first acquired 2 gnats.  Ordered med rare lamb chops, came out charred and med well.  Veggies were grilled squash, forgettable.  Not impressed this time."}
{"text":"I love this place and eat here often. 

Breakfast skillet is tops!

Service is always personal."}
{"text":"Always a delight to come back to Sofra. The staff is always very friendly and courteous. Their Albanian sausage never disappoints. 

Our first stop for the New Year and place delivered again. We tried their special- churo French toast. This is one heavy breakfast. There were three on my plate and I could only barely eat one and a half. It was awesome though. Must try if you come visit."}
{"text":"If you want to get away from the chain store restaurants that dominate in this area and try some excellent Mediterranean food for dinner, this is the place. As long as you aren't looking for fine dining. 

Run by an Albanian native, Sofra has an eclectic menu. We went all Mediterranean, and loved it. 

First the wine list: Three or four dozen wines, good choices from all over the world, with only one priced over $30. Great start. Once we understood the owner's background, we decided to go all appetizers. We had calamari, hummus, olives, and dolma for a light dinner. The servings were all large, accompanied by plenty of pita bread. The olives were good, the calamari was predictable, the hummus was delightful. 

The dolma: Absolutely delicious. The best I've ever had. They were cooked well so the grape leaves were nice and tender. The rice and feta combination inside was just right. Then the yoghurt/dill/oil sauce made them outstanding, with a hint of tartness and a burst of flavor with each bite. Nothing dull about them. They were memorable, enough so that I'll make an effort to go to Sofra's when in the area just to have the dolma again. 

The decor matches the menu - a bit of everything. Service was good. This isn't a white table cloth restaurant. It's a fun place with some outstanding Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed.  Gyro is very obviously from a packaged kit.  Ice tea is from a crummy powder mix.  Pay at the register onthe way out certainly makes the atmosphere feel like a diner or pizza shop."}
{"text":"Quaint place to meet for coffee or a meal.  I had the Clam Chowder with my Mediterranean Panini.  The soup had chunks of potato, vegetables and some hearty sized clam.  I really enjoyed the panini, it's refreshing to have just a roasted vegetable sandwich.  I did fight the idea of eating it like a normal sandwich(the veges fell out ..all over the place) versus cutting it up..  I did ask for some mayonnaise in case the goat cheese wasn't making the sandwich, uh...wet enough.  I can't explain how I like me sandwiches any better than that.  The server suggested the Roasted Red Pepper Mayonnaise and it was fabulous.  I really didn't need it that much, in fact, it became a dip for the veges that kept falling out- even when cutting it with a knife.  All in all, I'd come back and order these two items again, but I'm ready to try the breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great casual place for dinner. Based on yelp reviews I thought it was just a breakfast place but they have a good dinner menu as well. Albanian saugage appetizer was good. Tasted kind of like a meatier breakfast sausage. Server suggested to put red peppers and salt to taste but I found it very flavorful already. I had the Chicken Albanese which was similar to a Chicken Alfredo with broccoli, onions and mushrooms. It was very good with lots of chicken. Great service."}
{"text":"The service is excellent, and my brother loved his Armenian Breakfast skillet. I ordered the eggs Benedict and was not impressed at all. The eggs were overdone and hollandaise sauce looked a bit brownish and did not taste like hollandaise usually does. I would go back but I would not order the eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Sofra isn't awful but it isn't fantastic either. I got a sub-par breakfast but would like to try some of their lunch or dinner options before completely writing it off."}
{"text":"Very good food.  I went twice and both times the food and service was excellent. Avoid the franchise joints and check out this great little place."}
{"text":"The setting is easy and relaxed.  The service is very good, and the food is delicious.  The menu has something for everyone."}
{"text":"Albanian food -- who knew it was so simple and delicious? 
I was at the Middleton Library and in search of something that was good and would not make me sorry I decided to eat out. 
Albanian sausages.... signs all over saying they were available by the pound..
The best part is their sausages they make by hand and sell for people's tailgating parties wedding etc... 
At first I was going to order a Gyro but then I needed to try a hamburger made form this Albanian suage . So light and delicate lamb/beef mixture but so light and the price was very reasonable for the QUALITY of food.. That is what I was looking for quality. They changed the name and appearance from a German restaurant a few years back and the food was awesome then !  Little did I know they are the same owners who decided to go back to their Albanian roots ! Jazzed up the place as well..  
comfortable contemporary very warm and cozy still. 

THEY MAKE THEIR OWN BAKLAVA!! Delicious coffee I had with it as well..."}
{"text":"It isn't often that I give out 5 stars, and this is based off of just one visit, however, it was perfect. Went on a Sunday for Breakfast with my mother and the wife and kids. I've heard good things and thought we should try, very impressed. Brought out pancakes for the kids, which were done perfectly and all the sudden our picky eater, was overly indulging in his food. The biscuits and gravy was amazing with their homemade sausage and the biscuit was so light and fluffy. Its not often when everyone couldn't stop talking about how good their food was. Service was great, and I always had hot coffee in my cup. I might have high expectations next time I go there, but I think so long as they continue to do what they do, I'll be just fine."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch last weekend and loved the place. We were seated very quickly and the staff was friendly and the ambience was great as well. Food arrived promptly and was delicious.
I would certainly go there again."}
{"text":"We went with 2 other adults and two young children for Sunday brunch. I am so thankful Sofra took reservations because we were seated at a corner type booth with plenty of space and elbow room for our group. The coffee was always replenished and served piping hot. I had the biscuits and gravy and J had a n omlette with the Albanian sausage. The sauasge sort of reminded us of a mild like chorizo, DELICIOUS, so we ordered another side of it and took more of it home with us. Service was quick and speedy. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Really good for lunch! The tortilla soup was good, and I had a delicious salad with lamb and beef sausage. Quick, friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Quaint resturant that had excellent service. Went there twice during my stay for a half marathon that I was running nearby."}
{"text":"I would have given this restaurant 5 stars but my new policy requires my ultimate Restaurant factor to wit: from now on if one of the three important things in the rest room aren't working I am going to pan it. Here are the three important. things and now a days tied to motion detectors: water, soap, towels. If one three important. Features does not work, I go 1 star on the place. The place did not have soap working. PLEASE AMERICA TAKE DOWN THE MOTION DETECTOR HAND WASHING FEATURES?"}
{"text":"I stopped here for dinner the other night with my two small kids on a whim.  I was nervous it was too nice of a setting for kids, but the restaurant did a fabulous job catering to them with fast service and a fun coloring sheet. And the food was delicious!! I ordered the roasted chicken with vegetables and rice.  It was so good!  And my two kids had the sausages and butter noodles.  Each of their meals were very reasonably priced and came with a drink and delicious side of fruit.  We will definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"So Friday is a nice family-style restaurant. It does have an Albanian twist to it. Lunch is quick and good but not great. My kids would say great when it comes to breakfast for lunch"}
{"text":"My mom LOVES going out to breakfast and on her most recent visit to Madison, we decided to finally check out Sofra's. I had, of course, long heard of those famous Albanian sausages but for some reason had never ventured in. I'm so glad I finally did. The space is oddly comforting. There is nothing particularly nice or special about it but it just kinda feels really comfy. The tables are a little close together and a bit small as others have noted but it really somehow works. 

The Turkish coffee was great. Our server was very excited for me to try it-why yes, this was my first Turkish coffee. It was served with a small piece of Turkish delight (some sort of jelly candy with peanuts). She carefully described what makes Turkish coffee Turkish and explained about how you don't drink it until the last drop. Very helpful tips!

The food was great. I had the biscuits and gravy which were fine-nothing wrong with them but not a stand out either. My mom thoroughly enjoyed one of the daily specials-the Sante Fe skillet. It featured pulled chicken (which was excellent) as well as corn, black beans and potatoes. Her only (very mild) gripe was that the jalapeños were pickled instead of fresh. The server said they never had fresh jalapeños as they don't go through enough of them. Overall she was very pleased with the dish.

And, of course, those famous Albanian sausages. They were outstanding as promised. Probably a bit too savory for me for breakfast-but absolutely made me want to come back to try their lamb burger.

Top everything off with super friendly staff which made my first visit here just delightful. I will be back indeed."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the Albanian sausage and eggs. Would 100% go back just for the sausage! They taste like kebabs. And I've been missing kebabs!! The chili flakes and the sea salt makes it even more excellent. Need to try the corned beef hash, but I'd still get a side of the sausage regardless. Iced tea was mediocre sadly, and would have preferred to sit upstairs, but will definitely be back! Especially in the summer when I can get some of those delicious sausages for my own grilling...!"}
{"text":"Cute clean and authentic.  Any place with a great breakfast AND mimosas gets 5 stars automatically, but these guys deserve it. The Armenian sausage is wonderful!! (Just hope I don't have to breathe near anyone the rest of the day). The chicken skillet was really good but menu says pulled chicken and it was just nice hearty chunks. If you like spicy, ask for their crushed red pepper, I almost stole the jar! It has to be home made as it was better than any I've had. 

Worth a visit for sure."}
{"text":"Albanian Qebap with wedding soup (fridays for the soup) and a Capital Amber...

At almost every place we go, i will try something different each time (*if we go back) to round out my experience and try to find something i really like... I don't think i can move past this one the menu; it's really that good.

It was also great to see our server really enjoying that we were loving the food too"}
{"text":"Atmosphere:
I've been coming here for over six years and the atmosphere has always been great. They recently (in the last couple years) remodeled their interior to create more tables and redecorate the outdated chairs, booths, and table pieces. I have only ever been seated in the main dining area on the first floor so I can't speak to what is downstairs - I can only assume it's very similar. There are also a few tables outside on the sidewalk for some outdoor seating in the summer.

Food:
I have mainly come here for breakfast over the years but have also had brunch and lunch, all of which have been extremely positive and delicious experiences! The homemade Albanian sausage is really tasty so any of those dishes are great, in addition to the Turkish coffee which is served with a side of a Turkish delight - yum! There is usually a really tasty special on the specials board so don't forget to check it out or ask. My go-to breakfasts are the Albanian Sausage Skillet or Southwestern chicken skillet and lunch would have to be the salmon club.

Service:
The service is always great - fast and hardworking servers that have been there since I started eating here. They promptly serve drinks and the food also doesn't take long to come out. It's always packed on Saturday and Sunday mornings but I've almost always have been seated within 15 minutes of arrival. I've come to know one server is particular and we always chat whenever I see her.

In summary:
I think my choice to come here for over six years is a testament to how I feel about Sofra. The family that owns this place has clearly done a great job in maintaining a high quality of food and service which makes customers want to return. Definitely stop in here for a meal when in town!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere.  If you're fine with the staff making friendly but awkward jokes about your visible medical condition (which you should be), this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Echoing others' reviews, the Albanian sausage is great. Skip the regular coffee and the homemade sausage gravy that tastes like every other breakfast joint's bland version.

I had the Albanian sausage skillet with eggs and wheat toast. This sausage is awesome. The feta and peppers and onions are lovely. They actually had a multigrain bread as a wheat option. You should get this.

I don't know what is up with the coffee. I overheard the people next to me complaining about it too. If I go back, I'll try the Turkish coffee. A sign on the door insists NO carry-in drinks, as is a restaurant's right, so don't think you can stop at Starbucks on the way. Try the Turkish and post what you think."}
{"text":"My first impression when I walked in was \"omg what is that delicious smell!!\" Then charming and cozy atmosphere caught my attention. Overall it is a very nice place for breakfast/ lunch/ dinner. I had the Albanian skillet with poached egg and Turkish coffee. The skillet was very good but the coffee was something else. It's like a very strong espresso yet very creamy even though they didn't put any cream or milk in there. I am a coffee lover and this is definitely one of the best. My boyfriend had a lamb burger and the patty was so amazing."}
{"text":"This place was alright.  They don't do outdoor seating on Sundays,  which is a bummer. 
The staff were very attentive,  but I didn't think the food was really worth coming back for.  You could get the same caliber meal at a family dinner. 
I ordered the Albanian Benedict special, and my friend ordered the Greek omelet.  Mine was barely warm, and though it tasted fine,  they lost points for the temp factor."}
{"text":"Coffee was very bitter and sour. Ordered the Albanian sausage and eggs. Best part was the sausage - taste like a blend of gyro meat. I would order this again."}
{"text":"Went to the Bavaria this morning for breakfast...it's pretty much your local family restaurant...complete with flowery booths and more than a handful of \"regulars\". The only thing I didn't like was the fact that my waitress seemed in a rush to get my order. She asked me if I wanted coffee before I even got my butt in the chair(I DID look tired...), and came back with a cup in 30 seconds...and wanted my order. I asked for a minute, and that's what she gave me. Feeling rushed(I was torn between the blintzes and the eggs Benedict), I went for the blintzes. They were quite good(better than the coffee which was nothing better than tolerable). Really, two could have split one order. 

I'd go again, but I guess I should have my order on-hand."}
{"text":"I decided to stop at this Albanian diner on my bike ride today to try something new outside of downtown Madison. Overall, I thought it was good but not outstanding. The sausage is very good and as you can see from other posts recommended by a number people.

The one thing that I really like about it is the number of healthily options for a diner. Sometimes that's hard to come by but they make it a point to be a bit healthier."}
{"text":"Sofra used to be my go to. However recently the owners wife zamira works there and is extremely rude she messed up my order and I take out regularly or at least I used to. She is rude to customers. Avoid this place at all costs zamira is a not friendly and not a nice lady and unfortunately her husband employs her!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food were fantastic.  The red pepper dip was out of this world.  The presentation and flavor were exceptional.  

You're not getting a chain restaurant dining experience when you come here.  You're getting a home cooking family flavor in a modern bistro dining experience.  

The price also can't be beat."}
{"text":"Not bad for a rather standard lunch.  The food is ok if a bit high priced, and they do have a few Mediterranean type things. Been there twice now and I would say Meh.  I've experienced better, but the one thing that really turned me off was the service.  You almost get the feeling that they would love owning a restaurant if not for the customers.  Hint, when someone gives you their money act pleased not annoyed.  My wife and I like to order several apps and then split an entrée.  The cost is typically more then just a coupe of entree's but you get to try more things.  The fact that they charged me a $1.50 because I wanted to cut my sandwich in half and give half to my wife (I wasn't asking for an extra plate or anything)  is a bit over the top if you ask me.  Its not like we were ordering less and paying less.  It would be interesting if we both had ordered entrees and then cut them in half to share... I think they would have tried to charge both of us an upcharge. Anyway I suppose if you just don't tell them what you plan to do they wouldn't know and won't try to upcharge you... although if they do notice you might find the fine on your bill?"}
{"text":"WONDERFUL! I've never knowingly had Albanian food and ohhhh do I like it! When I eat something that is new to me I tend to go a bit overboard on the ordering. As per usual, I dined here by myself (Actually I got takeout.), and ordered enough food for dinner as well as lunch the next day. Gotta love having a corporate expense account. 

I ordered the beef stroganoff, Albanian wedding soup, dolma, Albanian sausage, and had a free sangria. Yea, entirely too much food. The beef stroganoff was great. Sauce was well balanced for a restaurant stroganoff; however, a little saltier than I would have made it at home. Nearly perfect ratio of sauce to noodles as well. I appreciate that. 

The soup was... different. Different than any soup I've ever had before. Thick, creamy, lemony, with tender chicken, and noodles that I thought were a tad soft. I should have asked how it was spiced. The flavor is lingering in my mouth as I write this and it's a lilttle woody, a little earthy, a little bitter, and pretty damn delicious! 

I love dolma. My wife doesn't like dolma like I do so when I have an opportunity to charge an order of dolma to the Fortune 500, I jump on it! This is one of the better dolmas that I have had, and I've had all sorts from many cultures, both homemade and restaurant made. I consider myself to be a good judge of dolma, and I consider this to be pretty good. Texture was perfect: soft, but stayed together for dipping. Lemony flavors from the slices it came served with (I didn't squeeze any on).

Albanian sausage, this is what everyone on this Yelp page is talking about. Awesome! I love sausage in general, so I may not be the best judge of this as I am easily impressed, but I can say with certainty that no one would walk away disappointed in their decision to order it. 

On top of all of this, one of tonight's specials was a free sangria with entree purchase. I enjoyed the sangria very much while waiting for my takeout order, which made the wait time (about 15 mins) pass by very quickly! 

If giving half stars were possible, I would rate this place a 4.5. I'm rounding up rather than down because of how great the people working there are. Friendly, generous with that free sangria on a takeout order, helped guide me through the order, etc."}
{"text":"Babe and I went here for breakfast. No complaints for the basic breakfast staples of potatoes and eggs, what was fabulous was the toast! I tell you, if you pay attention to toast in restaurants you don't often get perfectly toasted toast. I was happy, but beyond that the Turkish coffee and the accompaniment of the Turkish delight was really good. We also tried their hand-made Albania sausage (lamb and beef mixture); it had a wonderful flavor. We went on Friday morning and sat by the window. It was a wonderful breakfast and a wonderful memory."}
{"text":"Sofra is a solid family owned cafe. There is also a family connection to Villa Dolce around the corner. Villa Dolce is an upscale pizza place - my favorite pizza place. 

Back to Sofra... I generally hit Sofra for breakfast/brunch. Breakfast is available all day, but they also have a robust lunch and dinner menu. Sofra is the type of ace that asle as has at least one special. 

Today I ordered the Greek Omelette - companion had the Meat Lovers Omelette. The Greek version came with gyro meat and veggies with a yogurt sauce to pour on top. The Greek Omelette is one of my favorites. Omelette's come  with a choice of hash browns or home fires. I go for the home fires. 

Sofra used to have a blueberry granola pancake on the menu. It's not there anymore, but if you ask you can still get them. We split a 2-stack... I just can't go to Sofra without craving those blueberry granola pancakes!

The Eggs Benedict are worth a shot as well... As are many of the other menu items. Eat local... Explore the local joints across town and when you travel."}
{"text":"The food was good, (I had the gyro). But the reason why it is A-OK was because the waitress abandoned us midway and she just talked to her friends for the last half of our meal."}
{"text":"I took my wife here on Monday night to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and the service was exactly what we wanted. We started with a glass of wine each and an appetizer to share. The pace of the service was perfect - we had just enough time to really enjoy our food and the time with each other in between courses, and our water was never empty. Unfortunately, there was so much food that we didn't have any room for dessert, but that's what our next visit will be for!"}
{"text":"You have to try this place!  I am a fan!  The food is terrific and service is outstanding!! 

Driving around after some plans fell through I let my stomach be my guide and wound up here.  As I sat down a woman who I assume is the owner greeted me and made me feel very welcome which was nice because I felt a little out of place going to a restaurant on a friday night alone.  My waitress was also very nice and very genuine.  

I ordered the Mediterranean White fish which came in a tomato based sauce that I can not stop thinking about!  Forgot to mention that I started off with a tortilla soup which was surprisingly good for a restaurant that wasnt a Mexican restaurant.  I went for the gusto and ordered a coconut pie for desert with a dessert wine which was a mix of 3 reds and some cocoa.  No complaints!! Everything was amazing!  

I went back a couple of days later and tried the rotisserie chicken with rice and grilled veggies.  Again no complaints.  Amazing!!  That meal started with Albanian soup that was great.  

I love this place and cant wait to take the man.  The portions are huge and the plates are filling."}
{"text":"On several recent visits, which actually average out to about 2 1/2 stars, I have drawn some new conclusions about this Middleton staple.  When the boss is around, their margin of error seems to be lower.  To backtrack, our plucky server was charged with taking care of 2/3rds of a dining room, which is why I don't blame what happened in my second visit on her.  As a weekend special, Sofra's lamb shank is a steal at $12.95.  The initial of the two recent visits featured an ample and steaming shank, with a baseball sized serving of mashed potatoes and also at least a cup and a half of green beans.  On the second visit, the shank was served slightly above tepid, and the sides portions were (to put it politely) meager.  I sent it back to be reheated, but the temperature was the same at presentation.  Had the boss been around on the second occasion, I am sure he would have made things right, but I didn't see anyone who looked to be in charge."}
{"text":"The homemade Albanian sausages are amazing, particularly with the garlic cream cheese dip they come with. Portions are generous, large enough for two, but they add an almost $2 sharing charge. Service can be brusque. Prices are on the high side - $12 for a lunch entree - but you'll get plenty of food. This is the kind of local spot I want to support, so that impulse makes up for some of the shortcomings."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 14 after searching and finding in Yelp (in town from New York). No issue on holding a reservation...and managing a late 4 person addition.

Food and service was as advertised....very tasty and nice people. 

Without a doubt the best options are anything with the homemade sausage.

Best bet: Turkish Coffee and the Albanian Skillet.

Enjoy! We did!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous place. The food was outstanding and the owner was delightful! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"A wonderful homey aroma as we entered this intimate, casual bistro for a Sat night dinner. I was thrilled at the prices for the large plates offered! We went for the Albanian entrees: Chicken appolonia and Qebap (lamb/beef sauages). The chicken kebabs were so juicy and served with dolmades and a little spinach pie.  The sauages were light if a little salty and came with delicious, crispy french fries sprinkled with feta cheese and  a shepherd's salad - which is vinegar marinated tomatoes/peppers/onions/cucs.  I liked this salad a lot, reminded my of my Mom's cooking.  They have a wide selection of desserts, but I felt like these were not homemade nor traditionally Albanian.  So skip dessert and have an appetizer instead.  They know how to cook their traditional foods for sure.  I will be recommending this delightful little cafe."}
{"text":"2's little harsh, it's more like 2.5.

I smelled bleach as soon as I sat down at a booth near restroom. But that was only a warning sign.
While my friends seemed to enjoy their omelet and benedict for brunch, my so-called Belgian Waffle suffered from a serious identity crisis. I want to know what was Belgian Waffle about it. 

What I got was a pale colored, flavorless slab with out-of can syrup/juice immersed soggy mess. Wow, really. How could you do that to a plate of waffle?

The service was ok. Pleasant, but without a charm.
The place gets busier with after-church crowd on Sunday. So timing is a key."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast because of yelp reviews and very glad we did. They were busy when we got in but rushed to get everyone seated. Food was great! The sausage was a must."}
{"text":"Could have been one of the worst meals we have had in ten years. I got the baked cod with roasted potatoes. The fish was a perfectly shaped rectangle that tasted like cardboard.  Had to have been from a box.  Also, still wondering how to make roasted potatoes tasteless, but they did it.  
My mom didn't even finish her bowl of soup, and it was all she ordered.  It was my second visit, and deinitely my last.  Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Don't forget yo roll your sausage in the salt n pepper mix that comes from the shakers!"}
{"text":"It got the 3 stars as a positive because the staff was attentive and friendly.  The food itself was just OK.  Eggs Benedict were non descript, and they as well as the hash browns came out cold.  There's nothing worse than cold food served to you.  Possibly should have tried the sausage they are known for."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken salad sandwich and it was such a sad plate. The plainest white bread and small leaf of lettuce. Some of the dishes I saw go by looked good, so I plan to return and see if other menu items are less disappointing."}
{"text":"Delightful little restaurant with amazing service and pretty fantastic French fries. I'd give a higher rating but I only ordered a blt. I'll have to try again."}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly people and badass breakfast. Get the Turkish coffee. Southwestern scramble was perfect!"}
{"text":"I brought my son here for a special event.  My review will probably reflect more on the catering aspect versus the regular menu you'd usually deal with.

The staff were very friendly and attentive.  I thought they were going to pass out when I asked for a diet soda or a water (since they were providing fancier drinks for our group).  They eventually took care of it, but it was a bit funny how they reacted to my request.

I thought the food was very good.  It's a big \"fancy\" - \"lamburgers\", gourmet-style pizzas, etc.  Sofra seems to try to provide upscale food for reasonable \"regular night out\" prices.  I enjoyed several foods myself - the lamburgers were very flavorful - I could have eaten way too many of those, but there was more to try!  The beef and chicken skewers were great - good cuts of meat and not over-seasoned.  I think when you order off the menu, they come more as a kabob (with veggies on them).  Our catering just had the meat - and that was fine for me.  As I said, everything looked really good.

The facilities are quaint.  On a busy night, you might have to get cozy with folks eating near you.  If you're okay with that, you're good to go.  If you're looking for something more intimate and quiet, you might have to ask for special seating, if that's even an option.

I'd eat here again, but I know it's not in my wife's wheelhouse.  Maybe a work lunch/dinner will land me here again.  I'm in!"}
{"text":"The food was great and they had good service. When we had a reservation, it was a short wait and we got our food in time. The Turkish delights were great and tasted of a combination of honey, brown sugar, maple syrup, and had a consistency of sticky, soft Jello."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious. 

The Albanian sausage alone is worth coming here for. Quick service, nice atmosphere and good coffee!

Nothing disappointing here whatsoever. Looking forward to coming back in the future."}
{"text":"They have Turkish coffee! And great friendly service! And yummy food. The Albanian sausage was very good. Different than typical breakfast pork sausage, more savory I think. Nice place to visit while in town for a tournament."}
{"text":"Our food was just fine, nothing special. They did however seem to have a problem with my service animal. They kept asking me to move her, which was completely unnecessary and uncalled for. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent food, generous portions, reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I was on vacation in Middleton this week  and my friend that lives there and I were looking for something different to have for lunch. Sofra looked nice from the outside so we tried it.

I believe the place was recently redecorated because another customer remarked on the removal of some tables and placement of some booths making the place look spacious. I really liked the decor--bright and modern with a fresh look. We were a little late so missed a lunch crowd if they did have one. The place had three senior citizens eating alone reading the paper. It seemed like the type of place they frequent. I mentioned to my friend these three seniors should have sat together and made a party of it...

My friend and I both had the Gyro ~ Savory gyros meat, sliced thin and served with onions, tomatoes, cucumber sauce and feta cheese on a grilled pita. Mine with french fries (hey, i'm on vacation and calories don't count!) and she had the chicken noodle soup. Sandwich was very good and very filling. I especially liked the cucumber sauce that was on the side for us to put as much on as we liked. My fries were really good but my guess is that they were frozen--the type that are dipped in something to make them crispier. I liked them but they weren't like fresh cut fries. My friends soup looked OK--she really liked it. The soup had large chunks of carrot and celery in a clear broth. it reminded me of something you might find at a cafeteria. Not out of this world but good and hearty.

All in all, I would recommend Sofra but not highly recommend. Staff was very friendly and efficient, prices were reasonable and food was good. Not the sort of place you would go to if you are looking for a special place to eat but yes, it was good and filling."}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights

1) good breakfast
2) lacking ambiance
3) good location

Sofra has a great location right downtown in Middleton. You will likely need to street park, but there is almost always something available.

We (a group of 5) stopped in for Sunday brunch around 11am. Sofra looked really busy, but there is a whole section in the basement so we were seated right away. Maybe it's because we were in the basement, but the ambiance is nothing to really write home about. Banquet chairs with dated chair covers, and a few TVs. It's a family restaurant feel.

The menu at Sofra (specifically breakfast) is great! There are a ton of savory and sweet breakfast entrees, and some of the entrees are Greek inspired! Everything from skillets, to omelets, to pancakes and even Dolmas! We didn't try them, but I did see gluten free pancakes on the menu. We tried the southwestern chicken skillet and the Mediterranean omelette. The portions were fair and the food was pretty good! Fairly traditional family restaurant quality. Nothing seemed super fresh but it hit the greasy brunch craving. 

Worth a stop in if you haven't been here before, but I probably wouldn't go out if the way!"}
{"text":"Wow - what a treat. Delicious breakfast in a small-town setting. The Albanian sausage and egg breakfast and skillet breakfast were both very good. The service here is very attentive and friendly. I'd come back here for breakfast any day of the week."}
{"text":"Ok breakfast food in Middleton.  Service is always friendly but their prices keep creeping up for what you get.  As a long time Middleton staple they have a loyal following, I would describe this as diner type cuisine."}
{"text":"Sofra offers a mix of American and Mediterranean cuisine. I visited around 1pm on a Tuesday. The place was nearly full, and we were seated promptly. The interior is comfortable--and interesting mix of cusual and upscale decor. The waitservice was very professional. I ordered a Turkey Avocado Sandwich. It arrived promptly and tasted good. The menu is quite extensive and there is a good selection of daily specials."}
