{"text":"My go-to spot for Chinese take out!  The BBQ Pork Fried Rice and Egg Drop Soup are my favorites, but the Thai Curry dishes are yummy too.   Service is always very friendly and delivery orders arrive in no time!  So happy to have this place just minutes from my house."}
{"text":"Love this place.... recently moved almost 4 miles further away.. crossed my finger hoping they would deliver this far... lucky me they did. They have the most amazing duck in Las Vegas... always great.. highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB. My go to place when i have the munchies!!!! I beleive the guy who served me was Bruce and was on point with it!! Thank you XO ps xoxoxoxoxoxxo"}
{"text":"Got take out and had them deliver a few times.  If your in the mood for Chinese takeout this place isn't bad.  Delivery added one star to my rating so keep that in mind when ordering."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened.   I looked up Chinese food on my mobile Yelp and this was one of my two choices. This place got better reviews then Jackie Chan so I went with it.   The Hubs and I ordered Chicken Lo Mein, Spicy Garlic Broccoli, Szechuan  Shrimp and Chicken Curry.   They said it would be 45 min to an hour. Got there in 20 min. Great, we left them a big tip and got ready to dig in.   Where did the meat go?? Considering I try not to eat many carbs, there was no meat in these dishes. I didn't try the lo mein but the shrimp and chicken curry had a few bites of meat and all veggies. Needless to say, I went hungry because I don't eat rice. The curry had a weird flavor. I haven't had tons of Thai curry so I am basing my comparison on Pin Kow which is yummy. The spicy broccoli was the only thing that didn't disappoint. When I am paying 9 bucks for a chicken dish, I expect there to be chicken in it.   I will never order from here again. Waste of 40 bucks."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place out because most restaurants like this end up being bad. But to my surprise not only was the food really good, the service was amazing!!!! Bruce and Vince were very helpful and went beyond my expectations. Me and my family will definitely be going back!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this Asian restaurant. Crab Rangoon is extra delicious. They also have a wide variety of salads and chicken. The service is great, sir Alan is a very kind man. Thing is, kind of a bad place to go unless you have a ton of self control. You want to eat everything! Also they give you more than a generous amount. Awesome if you live in mountains edge easy access!"}
{"text":"I come here every two weeks when I'm too lazy to cook for myself . The service here is very courteous and is willing to take custom orders. Like the beef fried rice and beef lo mien  . Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not very tasty.  I ordered a spicy garlic dish, which had no spice or garlic.  Fresh veggies were good, but it didn't make up for the blandness of the food.  The female at the counter was not so nice to deal with.  I will avoid this place, even thought it is on the way home."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the sweet and sour pork it was hard as a rock! Maybe it sat out too long."}
{"text":"I work in the southwest and this location is very close to my office.  The food is really great here. My favorite is the orange chicken and the mixed veggies. The staff is friendly and helpful. I frequent this location often when I am craving Chinese Food."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food! I love the salt n pepper shrimp and pork chops! Delivery is fast and the staff is very friendly. I definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I had the general tsos chicken and it was sour and disgusting. I also had the refried pork rice very bland. I will not go back."}
{"text":"The lady was rude and rushing, i was still nice and tipped. Didn't know what was up with her?  Thinking she will be nice when i ordered something again... But regardless the rice was alil undercooked. Never going to that local spot. Now i go up the street to Jackie chan chinese. Much better and frendly people."}
{"text":"This place is great. Large portions, great tasting food and very pleasant workers. They always give me the free items without having to remember my coupon.   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Fresh, clean, tastes great. healthy and caters to my food allergies!  They deliver too"}
{"text":"I ordered Kung Pao Chicken, but that was not what I got. No Peanuts, just a ton of bell peppers and huge chunks of chicken with no flavor and no heat. Kung Pao is supposed to be small diced chicken and vegetable. I also ordered combination fried rice, this tice tasted like like a wooden spoon had stirred it for a week. I will never eat there again, disgusting, try Rice and Noodle instead."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful!  They have really gone down hill.  The brown rice was more like minute rice.  The teriyaki chicken was like the frozen pre-made you find in a grocery store.  The pot stickers you could definitely tell they didn't care when cooking them, they had a quick burnt fry on the bottom.  Never again!"}
{"text":"WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!  Be EXTREMELY careful when you order here especially if you're taking it to go.  They will intentionally leave out certain items (egg rolls, fortune cookies, and such) and by the time you get home, it's too late (at least that's what they hope).  This has happened to me 3 times in a span of a month and every single time, it's been a to go order.  When we eat in, it's fine, every time.  Another thing to ABSOLUTELY look out for is the order accuracy.  I swear to you, over 80% of my orders have been wrong which is mind boggling! You will also notice people checking their orders before they walk out because everyone has been a victim of a wrong order or missing items which appears to be the norm.  Besides these shady business practices, the orange chicken is the only thing I eat here and that's OK when they actually make it right, which happens rarely.  Most of the times it's very mushy and soggy even when you're eating in so you need to MAKE SURE they fully cook it unless you want to eat mushy, moist breaded chicken.  Aside from the orange chicken, everything else I tried sucked.  I'm officially over orange chicken so I won't be going back to this restaurant ever again.    Finally, if your order is wrong, they WILL FIRST BLAME YOU and try to send you off but DO NOT CAVE IN!"}
{"text":"YUCK! Worst Chinese food. I would rather have Panda Express. No flavor to the soggy orange chicken or the greasy egg noodles. $10 Delivery minimum + $2.00 Delivery fee. I should have just driven to Panda."}
{"text":"New owners fast delivery and speak good English  Food is really good I was happy with my choice"}
{"text":"Love the chicken wings!  Came here with friends and the service was wonderful.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I was craving some authentic Chinese food and came across this spot. I thought it was going to be your typical Chinese food, but surprisingly the quality was excellent. Didn't disappoint at all. Portions were more than enough food to last me the next day for lunch. The owners were very friendly and nice and their son Vince (I think that's his name) spoke very little English, as he told me how hard it is to pronounce the American vowels, but he got my order perfectly! Don't be discourage, you are living the American dream and doing a great job. Will definitely be back again, thanks!"}
{"text":"Not very good beef and broccoli tasted off. Orange chicken was okay. Don't think I would go back though."}
{"text":"Place is not a bad place for Chinese food. They were nice to give us steam rice and red bean sesame balls with our food order. The food tastes authentic to me."}
{"text":"Talk about the ultimate meal for that rough time that comes twice a week aka day before payday!  It's cheap, it's tasty, they deliver, they're fast, and you will be full.  I'm slowly drifting off into chinese food coma, with leftovers in the fridge.  Things are looking up... Tomorrow's Friday, I got some tasty leftovers for lunch, and it's payday!  *Put on speed-dial."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time. The place was very clean, was greeted right away; very polite. I order the wor wonton soup, which is filled with vegetables and different meats; also order the shrimp lo mein.  Everything was made fresh to order. Everything tasted so good! Reminded me of the Chinese food on the east coast. I'll definitely be back again! Highly recommend this place to others"}
{"text":"I went in to XO Chinese food w an open mind. Was and craving a quick bite to eat. I had tried other Chinese food restaurants nearby, Jacky Chans, WTpho? I ordered my go o Chinese dish of General tso chicken. I told the man working as the cashier that it was dine in. After waiting awhile a woman emerged with my to go order all bagged and tied up in a plastic bag. I told her I was eating there and she looked surprised. After opening the bag and container of food and  trying the chicken which was hard and looked old like they had some leftover chicken and dumped sauce on it. Everything was dry and old. The food looked absolutely nothing like what was pictured on the menu on the wall. Not sure if I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"I guess all good things must come to an end. The first time I tried XO it was good. Food was hot, staff was friednly, and it was decently priced. I am from the Midwest and I was thrilled to find an authentic Chinese food restaurant here in Vegas. The second time it was awful. The food looked like it was microwaved and had no taste. They charge you for extra rice which I think is ridiculous. Plus, we didn't get any fortune cookies! Isn't that a tradition?! My husband convinced me to go a third time hoping that last time was a fluke. I'm sorry to say that the food still sucked. There was nothing fresh about it and it was cold. I'll be on the search for a better place to get some Chinese cuisine...."}
{"text":"Gross. Greasy. White chicken meat did NOT even taste like white meat. Mongolian Beef (?) was that actually real beef?? Veggies were even disgusting. Rice was crunchy and resembled maggots. None of us (4) could tolerate any of the meals we chose we threw it all away!!! Never again. Even if it were free AND the only food left on earth!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible chicken was old texture was odd and the food smelt foul! GROSS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate a ton of food here with friends. Fried rice was great, Duck was good, and the shrimp with the sweat white sauce was awesome.   5 stars because my stomach was fine the next day!"}
{"text":"Right down the street from our house, so it gets one star for being the quick, I don't feel like cooking we need to eat fast because I'm starving place. :)   Friendly staff, fast turn around for call in/pickup orders. Star.   The food is consistent and good. We order from here about twice a month so we are always trying new items. Hands down favorites because they are full of both veggies and meat are the Szechuan Hot Garlic Beef and Kung Pao Chicken. They have great Singapore Noodles and Combo Lo Mein. The Combo Fried Rice has large meat pieces and whole shrimp. Star. Honey Walnut Shrimp. Star. And earlier this year when I came in to place and wait for my order the lady working gave me a small sample of the Hot and Sour Soup. Yum. Salivating now just thinking about it.   Good food, reasonable price, friendly service, close by the house = winner."}
{"text":"General sao chicken is tasey,zestyand spicy. Portions size are good. Nothing to complain"}
{"text":"They said 30 mins. It was at my home in 20. The food was fantastic! Great Egg Drop Soup, Great Rangoon's, but the best Pork Fried Rice! I found a new place!"}
{"text":"Place is clean and was server right away. They have a nice lunch menu and the food was fresh. I got the Kung Pao Chicken but it had no pow... The chicken always good and the lo mein noodles were fresh. Not a bad place but not great. People behind the counter were very friendly."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I tried this place last night and I thought it would be better then it was.   I order the orange chicken because everyone was raving about it. My chicken was dry and you couldn't really tell that the sauce on it was orange didn't have any flavor really.   Chris order the Beef and Broccoli and it was very bland. The wonton soup was ok but have had better.   I did like the chicken on a stick and the crab rangoons and the egg roll.   I am going to try this place one more time just in case maybe they were having an off day!"}
{"text":"Xo Chinese Food is one of my families favorite places to eat. It is very clean and everyone is so friendly here. I highly recommend everyone to come and eat at Xo Chinese Food you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Pathetic food and pathetic way to serve the customers, people could care less about these reviews as this restaurant offers decent, should I say less than decent prices and also looks like that's the only Chinese restaurant in that area and obv people will treat it as a big thing as its so easy to grab and go, but the taste and ambience of the restaurant, the small from the sewege right Infront of the door all add up for me to not like this restaurant, I went there this past weekend and that would be my first and last visit..!! Hope they correct that small at least....horrible!"}
{"text":"I was on yelp trying to figure out whats good and close by when I saw xo. Everyone either had a good food experience or bad, unfortunately mine was horrible. The only reason why I gave it a one star was because the gentleman at the front desk was nice."}
{"text":"A great part of the community always offering and serving hot meals! Perfect for those days when you just dont have the time to prepare meals for the family. XO has plenty of options for everyone in the family and offers veggie options! Lunch specials are a great go to whenever you're in the area!"}
{"text":"XO Chinese Food definitely has some descent prices but. . . You get what you pay for. I had some beef and broccoli with the lo mein as my side. My girlfriend had the Mongolian beef. We also ordered some egg rolls and crab rangoons. We had the lunch orders delivered. This actually one of the quicker deliveries that I've had from a Chinese spot. The entrees were pretty good, no complaints on the Mongolian beef or beef and broccoli however, the the lo mein wasn't very good. It was edible after some soy sauce. The egg rolls were really good. Very fresh, really good. The rangoons were so disappointing I tasted no crab at all. Just a ball of fried cream cheese. I'll give them another chance though I want to try their fried rice. That always makes or breaks it for me."}
{"text":"Average , late in the day greasy, bland, have tried several times, it's the same just so,so"}
{"text":"I've lived in Vegas for 11 years, and of course have tried out numerous Chinese restaurants in town.  This one is an absolute favorite of my partner and I.  Not only are they very friendly and hospitable, but they are super quick! Especially with delivery. When we order delivery, it gets here so fast it's uncanny. Their portion sizes are very reasonable and the food is always fresh, hot, and tasty.  I highly recommend this location for anyone looking for \"real\" Chinese food on the go.  They also have some amazing lunch specials and and family deals. So even the price has a fair value to getting such great food."}
{"text":"The dinner specials are a great deal. You get a small size fried rice (enough for 2 people) and there's about 10 different meat combos. I got the short ribs, chicken wings and fried shrimp with pork fried rice. The rice was really good. Chicken and shrimp had a nice crunch, but not a lot of flavor. Good with duck duck sauce. The ribs were good, tender with lots of bbq sauce."}
{"text":"Do not eat here if you have food allergies. My daughter is allergic to shellfish, but had a reaction after eating the sweet & sour pork from this restaurant. I called and they said they cook everything ( including shellfish) in the same oil, so that is where her reaction came from. The lady I spoke to on the phone didn't offer a refund or care that someone got sick from their unsafe practices. They are not concerned with the safety of their customers, so we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Will never get the hot n sour seafood soup for almost 8 bucks and got 2 shrimps and nothing else. No crab no nothing. Want my money back. Bought a few entrees and got one container of rice. I just ate my chicken entree on its own because there was no more rice to spare. Total disappointment. Chances are i will never return. Already gave this place a chance from last experience based on taste. Best believe tonight was the 2nd and last visit."}
{"text":"What an awesome spot for the price! Nice what seemed to be family owned restaurant!  Always nice, fresh, and quick when we go in! Our favorite spot in the Area!"}
{"text":"Good food, fast delivery, never gotten an order wrong. The people there are very nice. I have been going to them for about 4 years now."}
{"text":"I always get the shrimp and broccoli and it never disappoints! It's a small little restaurant, but the price is good and I always order for take out."}
{"text":"XO Chinese food is awesome. For take out, i cant recommend a better place. My personel favorite dish is the pineapple shrimp fried rice. Prices are great and they deliver fast. Thumbs up to XO!"}
{"text":"we just moved here and were excited to try this food because we saw great reviews on YELP. The food was yucky. The chow mein/lo mein was noodles and beef only, tasted like top ramen at its best. The lettuce wraps filling resembled cat food in smell and look but i couldn't finish one. The egg rolls may have been ok as frozen egg rolls can be but they were cold.  Very disappointing dining experience. Our 1st try will surely be our last."}
{"text":"Better than China a go go.  Just moved to mountains edge and was looking for a new Chinese restaurant. Food was great."}
{"text":"Extensive menu and cooking style is on par with most Chinese restaurants one would expect to find. Ordered some Szechuan chicken and beef and it was kicked up to my spice tastes. General Tso is also good. Egg rolls and crab rangoon as well were delicious."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service.  Food is always ready when picked up.  Sweet and Sour Chicken is great but have noticed they are skimping on the veggies a little...  No other complaints:)"}
{"text":"I've been living in Mountain edge for almost 5 years and once a week I'll order my usual pad Thai noodle with shrimp.  So bringing my conversation up with owner how long I been here, we both reminisced on the good memories I had with this place.  By the time my food was done, he threw in some egg rolls on the side for me for appreciation.  This never cease to amaze me!  This asian joint will always be my go to when I have my Chinese food cravings."}
{"text":"They removed the Thai chicken curry from the lunch menu! You'll have to buy a full order WTF? Poor decisions!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, from the most rudest, unprofessional human being in the restaurant industry! Will never be back! Also they load your order with onions, and only sprinkle on some protein!!"}
{"text":"After our first visit...food was outstanding...we returned again for a second time...the food was just as good if not better, I love consistency...they have choices between large and small servings...the small servings are more than enough, I bet the large could feed you for several days.  The pork fried rice was outstanding...next time its the Kung Pao Chicken...go you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The crab rangoons are the best I've EVER had. Love the chicken fried rice and orange chicken. Always a happy customer after leaving."}
{"text":"Pad Thai Vegetable( $6.99)   Price was cheap. Pad Thai was the worst I have ever had.  Didn't even finish it.  In the Garbage it goes :(  Won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here all the time. He loves the orange chicken and I usually get the salt and pepper pork chops or shrimp which are both really good!"}
{"text":"LIKE. I've tried a few other Chinese places in the area, but this one is by far the best. Portions are generous and there are some specials that are even good for delivery! Also, plenty of vegetarian options--enough for me to have to sit and make a decision. I tried the lo mein, which was delish. Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"I'm always a fan of their lunch special. When I call, they know me by name and when I pick up my order, they know exactly who I am!"}
{"text":"I dont know about the other dishes, but their \"pad thai\" is absolutely  atrocious. I have never tried noodles as sour as sour patch kids  candy until now. Also, enjoy their fake sriracha sauce and chemical hot mustard. If that doesnt get you  hospitalized  i dont know what will. However, enjoy the fortune cookies!"}
{"text":"This is our family's favorite Chinese take-out/delivery restaurant.  The food is great and customer service is top-notch.  The portions are always more than we can eat.  The quality of the food is excellent - try their walnut shrimp - best I've had."}
{"text":"I just ordered some wor won ton soup and egg rolls. How disappointing! The won tons had very little meat and they had a really dough-y texture. I'm not used to that at all and didn't care for it one bit. The prices weren't bad but I just wasn't impressed with the food. Maybe I should have went to Jacky Chan down the street.."}
{"text":"Chinese food should be bomb. Not here need I say much. The food is tasteless and the flavors are all wrong. Egg rolls are my favorite things in the whole entire world and the egg rolls here are like cardboard. The chef should really be ashamed to put out such things and the sweet and sours dipping sauce that comes with it...SMH I can't even wrap my head around it. It was water downed and pink. All in all GROSS! I give a 2 star because my wife liked the chow main and I thought it was ok. I don't mess around when it comes to Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Apparently there aren't many good Chinese takeout places in Vegas. So putting this into perspective, I guess this place is okay. Good for lazy days when you don't feel like cooking or going out to get food, and are sick of pizza."}
{"text":"After spending the day at the hospital with my baby I called this place on my way home to order General tso-chicken to go. 5 minutes later I was there to pick it up. When I got home excited to have a meal what a nightmare, it was the most disgusting thing I have ever tried I can't even describe what kind of chicken they had sold me. We ended up eating white rice with NOTHING ELSE.. It was 8pm so I decided to stop by on the next day as it was already a long exhausting day to me and my family. Next day (Sunday) around noon I went there with my baby and just told the ''gentleman'' that they had served me something else instead of GTC, he immediately started screaming at me in front of all his customer ( Even when I tried to make it as discrete as possible). He said that if I hadn't returned it at the same day it was my loss... He wasn't going to refund my money or anything. I told him  that I was giving him the opportunity to make it right but as he was so ignorant I wasn't going to waste my time instead I was calling my bank and disputing the charge (Exactly what I did). Anyhow, this place should have been closed a long time ago. PS: Drive few more minutes and go eat something tasty, affordable and with an excellent service Rice and noodle on Rainbow."}
{"text":"Overall this place is good - it is close by but a bit pricey in my opinion.  We have tried most of the apps, the soups and chicken dinners.  All are very good, but nothing that stands out as great."}
{"text":"Our go to place for quick, delicious Chinese food! We love the BBQ fried rice, beef chow fun (dry) and mapo tofu. We always get delivery and they are fast! I love that they keep our information in their system so we don't have to provide our name, address, phone number etc every time."}
{"text":"It was ok. My fried rice wasn't evenly cooked and the seating area was pretty dirty."}
{"text":"Orange chicken from this place is really good.   Also tried the BBQ pork fried rice and was not bad at all.  Food is ready within 10 minutes of calling it in.  Will be coming here instead of China Go Go."}
{"text":"If I could give negative five stars I would.  I use to live in mountains edge, and when I lived there, it was my go to Chinese food spot.  When I was in Vegas over thanksgiving weekend visiting with family I thought to myself it would be a good idea to call in for some food to my OG go to spot.  Boy was I wrong!  I ordered the rib plate and was greatly disappointed.  They loaded the plate with broccoli and ribs with just bone minus the meat.  I thought short ribs were suppose to have some meat?  Then I proceeded to try the broccoli.  It was the most disgusting broccoli I have ever tasted.  I DO NOT recommend this place to anyone.  Avoid this place if you plan on eating good Chinese food.  If you want to take the risk in trying some disgusting food, be my guest.  Don't say I didn't warn you!"}
{"text":"We ordered about a hour before closing and I was nervous our food was going to be stale and cold. We was told the delivery was going to be about 30/45 mins so we said ok. Literally a half hour later our food was here. We opened our food and tasted it and fell in love! It was so hot and fresh. The rice seemed as if they mixed it with fresh and old rice cause it wasn't so fresh but the overall meals was great and I will be using them as our neighborhood Chinese food"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery last night from Xo Chinese. The lady who took my ordered was friendly and patient.  She said it would take about 30-40 minutes for delivery, and as promised the food arrived about 40 minutes. The delivery guy was friendly. Overall, I was very pleased with the customer service I received from them.   I ordered: Crab Ragoon-Delicious! I almost ate them all, but I had to contain myself.  Chicken Lo Mien-Lots of chicken!  Crispy Walnut Shrimp-The shrimps were big and delicious. Better than the Chinese food that I usually order from Chinatown.   Orange Chicken-It was good.  Bonus: Two free egg rolls! The egg rolls were decent, but nothing spectacular.  I would order from Xo Chinese Food again."}
{"text":"Not sure why all of the bad reviews. It's not the best Chinese food in the world, but it's not horrible. I've had all of the following at various times: both the chicken and veggie egg foo young, chicken is better. egg rolls are egg rolls, crab rangoon is decent.  Both the cashew and kung pao chicken are decent, and the chicken and pork friend rice are decent. I'd take this over PF Changs, but I would take Panda over this."}
{"text":"This is around the corner from our new house. I like the people here and think that they care about customer satisfaction. I have been here with my son and another time with husband. All three meals were good and we were happy. I can't rave about the food but it is good and near home. It makes us happy and we will be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in this area, the food is always fresh and the service is fast. I usually order the orange chicken with rice or chow main but the walnut shrimp is really good too."}
{"text":"Great tasting Chinese and Thai dishes! They have an extensive menu and their food isn't nearly as oily as other Chinese take-out/ delivery places I've been to- they even have a 'healthy menu' which has fresh steamed options instead of fried or sauteed."}
{"text":"This is the best local Chinese restaurant! We've had several different entrees and been happy with all of them. Delivery is pretty quick. Carry out is even faster. We have also dined in and been pleased."}
{"text":"This place is a bit out of the way but they have The best jumbo shrimp egg foo young with sauce."}
{"text":"I wish there was a 0 star option.  I will admit it was my mistake for ordering the \"Thai Chicken Curry\" from a Chinese place.  This dish was horrible.  Not even suitable for my dogs.  The alleged curry sauce looked and tasted a lot more like a bland powdered mix of store brand gravy for mashed potatoes.  After a few disappointing bites I quickly went for my white rice and threw the gravy and accompanying vegetables in the outside trash can.  This meal was an abomination.  This is my first yelp review.  I've eaten plenty of crappy food so, that says a lot.  Roaches wouldn't eat this plate."}
{"text":"Nice diverse menu. Very consistent and good. We live close by and we order often. One way to judge a place like this is by the freshness of the seafood, and they pass the test. My favorite is the Kung pao."}
{"text":"I live right across the street from this place. This is my number 1 place for amazing chinese food. I have tried over 5 other places and none of them can compare to this place. There food is reasonably priced and amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef and broccoli with crab ragoons! Thought it was extremely delicious and I will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This is the only place in Las Vegas where I will get Chinese food now. They make everything just how I like it. Close to home too!"}
{"text":"I actually really liked this place! They have dinner combos so you can eat more than one thing and it doesn't cost you a million dollars if you're the only person eating. The pork was a little sweeter than I'm normally used to but it was cooked well. Plus their chow mein does t have bean sprouts and I hate them so I appreciate that so I can just go for the noodles! I got this for carry out and it was done in 10 min and was packaged very well. I'll go back again soon."}
{"text":"Good Chinese take out. Chicken lo main is decent. Great pot stickers. Always quick delivery as well. Sometimes a little heavy but we haven't had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Used to live right around the corner from xo so it was a regular on our delivery list. Food is amazing and the family that runs it are so nice. I'm on the other side of the valley now but we still make the drive every once and awhile for some really good food. I highly recommend this place no matter where you live in the valley."}
{"text":"I just found this place when I boyfriend had ordered me food to deliver. Their orange chicken with rice is pretty good so I decided to come back for egg drop soup and garlic fried rice on a cold day. The egg drop soup is great, it even comes with small chips to with the soup and it's delicious. However, the garlic fried rice was a bit under cook. The rice was hard like it wasn't fully cooked, not much taste too. Don't get me wrong, food is good, prices are awesome, just pay attention to quality a bit more."}
{"text":"1st time order and was there fast and fresh portions looked small but was plenty will definitely order again glad we found good Chinese place to order from also cheap lunch specials"}
{"text":"I'm becoming a little obsessed with this place. My go to Chinese take out in the area, surpassing China a gogo imo. The pork fried rice is top notch. Overall a great value especially when you do the lunch specials. You can't even get a fast food combo for under $6."}
{"text":"Great food, great people, been going for years. I haven't ordered anything that wasn't good, hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant trying out this place based on the reviews, but was looking for a new chinese food place as the one I tried before near me I was not that impressed with. Wherever I live there is always a great chinese food place near by, and this is now my go-to as I just recently moved to the area. I got the D4 dinner combo with pork fried rice. The pork fried rice was awesome and they make it just how I like it. The chicken fingers, boneless ribs and beef on a stick tasted just as great."}
{"text":"Great service!!! Love ordering from here they have awesome food!!!! Good place to go to when you wanna skip cooking dinner and get some yummy take out instead."}
{"text":"What can I say, the food is good and the staff is friendly. Plus it's close to home. Not a picky eater so everything is fine with me. I'm a big fan of their combination fried rice and orange chicken. If you need a quick bite in yhe Blue Diamond area and don't feel like driving too far, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Let's talk about Xo Chinese Food..... The food was a delivery to my place and I was absolutely blown away by the quality of the food and the service.  My girlfriend and I ordered War Wonton, Rice, Chow Mein, Healthy steamed veggies and Chicken, and Orange Chicken...... The kicker of the meal Thai Ice tea - a favorite of mine!  On to the review, first, the food got delivered before the 30 minute time referred to us on the phone; always a plus.  Second, The food was neatly sectioned down to the broth used onto the chicken so those of us who like our healthy food super duper healthy need not worry; another plus. All the food ordered and paid for was included except..... the Thai Ice Tea :(  This is normally where I wouldn't include anything other than the food tasted fantastic and it was another three star place for having prompt service and great tasting delivery, however, no less then 10 minutes later a secondary driver.... Yup, second delivery person came to our door with my wonderful Thai Ice tea.  I understand the place is across the street from my complex, but that is above and beyond customer service.  It's five star Yelp and Mike P service.  Great job Xo I cannot wait to order from you again."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Deliver all over mountains edge and southern highlands, quickly! Great people! Try their orange chicken and crab Rangoon. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I finally tried this place after driving by it 8 million times.  I got a to-go order of the lunch special, chicken and broccoli for $5.95.  Everything was made promptly and packaged up in a styrofoam container.    I dove into the meal when I got home minutes later.  The chicken was all white meat lightly wok-tossed in a thin brown sauce with broccoli, sliced carrot, and pieces of green onion.  Pretty good but not quite as good as Rice N Noodle (they have a thicker, tastier brown sauce in their chicken and broccoli dish).   Their lunch specials all come with an egg roll and choice of fried rice, steamed rice, or lo mein.    Decent value and I'd like to return to dine in.  The restaurant is located in the middle of the strip mall.  On the inside, the decor is contemporary-modern, clean, and the counter staff can speak fluent English (not Chinglish)!"}
{"text":"Great, classic, last minute Chinese food. First restaurant on my list when I'm hungry and there's no food in the fridge (or if I'm too lazy to cook lol). Love the almond cookies also :)"}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times in the past two weeks because the food is tasty, CHEAP, and prepared quickly.  So far I've gotten Orange Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, and Kung Pao Chicken which all include white rice, fried rice, or lo mein and an egg roll for about 6 bucks. The portions are HUGE! They give it to you in a jam packed styrofoam container as you can see in my pics. There's so much that it normally takes me two days to finish. No problem there because I love me some Chinese leftovers.   The Orange Chicken is all white meat which makes it a little more dry than normal, but I still like it more than most other places because I prefer white meat anyway. My brother likes the General Tso's Chicken more though because he says it's less saucy than the Orange Chicken. The Kung Pao Chicken I tried today had way too many veggies. I know it's suppose to have a lot of veggies, but there was hardly any meat at all in there; I might as well have just gotten a vegetarian dish.   Pros: Cheap Big portions Free wifi! Slushies and Thai Tea Tasty food Location Nice staff Clean Free refills  Cons: Too little meat in some of the meat dishes Orange Chicken can be pretty dry  Overall, I like to come here for their Orange or General Tso's Chicken lunch specials because you get a lot of bang for your buck and the food is yummy. It's an added bonus that it's less than a mile away from my house ;)"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my meal here. I have the Mongolian beef bowl and it was delicious. Also got some pot stickers on the side.. They weren't the best I've had but dipped in some sweet and sour and was good to go."}
{"text":"Bomb.com, A \"go-to\" for anyone in the Mountains edge area for delivery, exceptional food with timely service.. This is the start of a long relationship :D"}
{"text":"Love this little hidden gem. After, I yelped a few Chinese spots this place popped up. The food was delicious and fresh. I ordered the chicken wings which were crispy and seasoned perfectly. The chow mien was delicious with lots of fresh veggies and meat. The service was quick and  friendly. Especially, this boy named Bince. He said how grateful he was living the American dream from the farmlands of China. I will be back and try the different items on the menu. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Hate to give any place less than 2 stars unless I think something is seriously lacking.  Well, in this case something is seriously lacking.  The Mongolian beef I ordered was made with the cheapest, chewiest beef since I bought beef jerky at 7-11 a few years back.  The fried rice option for the combos is PORK fried rice only.  You can't get regular fried rice.  The pork didn't really go well with the beef, although I'm not sure it was beef.  The fried rice itself was very dried out.  The combo meal consists of a choice of entrees for lunch, plus pork fried rice, lo mein and one other option.  You do not get soup with the combo, and a drink is separate......so much for the great prices.  If you got the Mongolian beef, with an order of soup, and a drink, the price of lunch would be well over $10.00....hardly a bargain."}
{"text":"Got so sick from this place. Ordered Mongolian beef for dinner. Vomit, crazy pooping, fever, chills  all by 4am.   Avoid this place like the plague!!!"}
{"text":"This place is just ok and stingy on the shrimp. My boyfriend and I both ordered combo plates - szechuan shrimp with chicken fingers and orange chicken with crab ragoon. They only gave us 3 pieces of the chicken fingers and crab ragoon. So it shouldn't really be called a combo if one of the entrees is not an entree size. And I can count in one hand how many shrimp was in my szechuan shrimp - they piled more of the veggies than the shrimp. For the money we spent, there was definitely not enough food for each of us. The only thing that was given enough was the orange chicken. We definitely won't be coming back unless we're desperate for some mediocre chinese food."}
{"text":"Decent spot for chinese food. Extremely fast service and gotta say the prices are more than reasonable,quickly becoming my favorite chinese takeaway since I moved this part of town."}
{"text":"My good friend got discriminated against by the general manager. What a shame.. Just lost a big number of clients."}
{"text":"Certain dishes are good, others are not. You have to try a few different things and see what you like. Their sweet and sour sauce is quite terrible but not really a concern to me. I wish I could give a half star to make it 3.5 but it is what it is. The service is actually what makes this place. Always a pleasure to order."}
{"text":"fast cheap food yes its here ! great good amazing not so much. But if you are in a bind and need to grub fast this is the spot. Its worth the money"}
{"text":"Best chinese in the Southwest area...it isn't the best I've had, but for location and convenience, we frequent here a lot!  Side note, if you order they have several free items depending on price point you spend, but you have to make sure to bring it up while on the phone or while ordering (if not they give you a lesser free item)"}
{"text":"Super yummy food! They have a vegetarian menu now which is actually impressive. From the combination fried rice to the hot and sour soup to the crab ragoons, it was definitely an enjoyable meal. Pretty good for chinese fast food! Definitely, will be back."}
{"text":"Have to change my mind here.  Excellent dinner tonight!  Had dinner with my family, got the garlic shrimp lo mein, sesame chicken, sweet and sour shrimp, boneless ribs, potstickers. Everything was on par!  The boneless ribs were out of this world good. Reminded me of NY chinese food, except better! My dinner was delicious, the sesame chicken was tender and flavorful, and my mother loved her sweet and sour chicken.   Also, the fortune cookies were hilarious. Mine told me that I would be a good lawyer (I dropped out of law school), and my mother's said she would take a vacation (she's on one). The other two were blank. Sidenote, wtf, blank fortune cookies?  Anyway, good dinner. We'll try one more time to see if this is 4 stars or 2 stars :)"}
{"text":"Family owned Chinese food place. Very sincere people that run this joint and not to mention AMAZING food. Been going to them for years and catered them many times for study sessions. If you are on the south side and are craving Chinese, look no further than XO."}
{"text":"This rating is for Fast Food Chinese not Sit Down restaurant. Owner is very good, takes no crap from anybody and gets the food out quick. Only complaint is for some reason he won't let you get 1/2 Rice and 1/2 noodles like everyone else in the valley does. The Steak and Onions is my favorite off the Lunch menu. They just remodeled the place and not sure when they re-open but I will be there for lunch within a few days."}
{"text":"What a great Chinese place. Food is great, Prices are very Good, I live in Mountains Edge and this is the Chinese place to go.  Combination fried rice is the very best menu item IMHO."}
{"text":"The order taker appears to lack the face to face Customer service when Ordering to go. No options of chow mien and fried rice. First time here but poor first impression."}
{"text":"Meh is right... lets start on a positive note. The service was friendly, very friendly. I ordered take out the General Tso Chicken with Lo Mein and Edd rolls. It came out pretty prompt (7ish minutes or so) But when I got it home i opened the bag only to notice the guy hadn't closed the lid all the way and the sauce and lo mein were every where. it drenched the egg rolls and made them soggy. It also made everything taste the same. And the noodles seemed to be over cooked, they are so soft... yuck! And for 10 bucks you can get much better. Ill stick with my Grand China on Durango & Warmsprings..."}
{"text":"Since I moved to Vegas I've been coming here. I do love the Xo's \"to go\". Our favorite dish in our house is the shrimp fried rice. We always order the party plate so we can eat with our guest or save for later, it feeds  6 for good."}
{"text":"I always go pick up food there when I have guests and no time to cook. The party plater feeds 6 easily. Our favorites are the Mongolian beef and shrimp fried rice"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money on the pad see ew.  By far the worst among with the pepper steak!"}
{"text":"Called order in. The gentleman who answered was very pleasant. However the delivery driver was extremely rude. Before handing over our food, she wanted her tip first. She had no problem asking for it as if it was owed. Which I would have given more if she wasn't so ungrateful. I ended up tipping her $1.80 because the nerve. Food portions of the family dinner are very small. The Mongolian beef had more onions than beef. No spice. Tofu and steamed veggies were okay. Could be more fresh. BBQ fried rice was good. Not much flavor but it was alright. Can't mess up white rice so nothing to say there. Egg drop soup was tasty. A little on the thick side. Lo main was okay. Lack flavor. Chicken on a stick tasted like they fried the chicken and then brushed sauce on. Would taste much better if it was cooked in foil. Spring rolls have more wrap than veggies. Overall I do not plan on ordering again."}
{"text":"So after reading reviews on yelp I wasn't sure if it was good or not. My desperation of being hungry and sick lead me to order delivery. I have to say I was impressed given I didn't have high expectations. The food was OK for the Price. I ordered the family meal deal with Curry Chicken, Beef Egg Rolls, Eggdrop soup, Fried Chicken strips on a skewer (I don't know what they're called), steamed rice and a side order of BBQ boneless pork ribs. The ribs were the best of them all. The egg rolls were too greasy and had a very stale texture to it. Their sweet & sour sauce was tasteless and probably just gelatin and red food dye #4. I have to admit they packed the food and soup very neatly. The delivery was within the 30min. window and a friendly guy. It's close by and I don't like Jacky Chan it's disgusting food so I would say I would order again if I was desprate and lazy to drive further to get something better. The soup was good, after I added chili to it. Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to order from them. How can you mess up Chinese Food? I'd hate to say it, but Panda Express was way better than this, and it's not a huge nationwide chain for no reason, they got their Shhhht right whether we want to admit it or not."}
{"text":"It's fast food Chinese what do you expect, well exactly that. Pretty good food the portions are okay. When I want good fast food I order for delivery or sometimes pickup either way it's a good experience. I always get hot n sour soup plain really good I recommend"}
{"text":"Decent fast food Chinese. I got the cashew chicken (my go-to dish at all take out places) and the mixed vegetables. The cashew chicken had huge pieces of chicken and plenty of cashews, along with some veggies. Pretty tasty overall. The mixed veggie dish wasn't bad either -- good variety of veggies, nice and crispy in a garlic sauce. This is one of the better take out Chinese places in southwest Vegas (at least compared to China a-go-go and Jackie Chan)."}
{"text":"For Mtns. Edge? It fulfills the Chinese food craving. Def a fast food type place. It was clean and staff friendly.   I had the pad thai, I am used to it having a bit more of kick but good. Figured since it was the first time I couldn't go wrong with it. The best was my edamame. Yummmmm.   Will prob go back because when you live in BFE Vegas and want Chinese fast, this will do. They deliver and you can call in your order too."}
{"text":"My go-to when I don't want to cook and need a quick delivery. Seriously, they're fast. I always order the fried rice and the Spicy Eggplant in garlic sauce. It's so good! The portions are also pretty generous so I get to enjoy it for a couple of days."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service! Ordered from here brought it home and the containers were not closed properly and all the food fell into the bag. Called and spoke with the owner and was told to return back to them. When I suggested I did not have the time too she didn't even offer to drop off more by delivery. I've read the reviews about the place. They must all be completed by there friends. Good luck here! I would never recommend this place to no one!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!! Super good pork fried rice! Big chunks of pork and really flavorful. Tried the Mongolian beef and orange chicken. Both were very tasty. Prices very reasonable. They have dinner combos between $8-$10 and you get very large portions! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I won't go back. The noodles were greasy, the orange chicken had a lot of soggy batter with flavorless bright orange jelly with a combination of fatty brown  meat inside I'm started to doubt it was actually chicken. I wouldn't be surprised if it was goat meat or neighborhood kitty cat. The meat was gross. It was over priced. And bad quality authentically masked with a fast food flavor. It reminded me of casino workers employee dining room free food offered. The kind of good that makes you violently ill."}
{"text":"Leaving another positive review because I can always count on friendly fast service and awesome food. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Love this place and I love how close it is to home. We have been eating here for the past 5 years and it is always delicious. My favorite thing on the menu is their chicken curry, so much flavor and you get a large portion. The family who run it are lovely and accommodating to any special requests that I have."}
{"text":"Salt and pepper pork are to die for. I live down the street and XO is my first choice if I am craving for good Chinese food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. I will never get tired of this."}
{"text":"Called in an order for delivery. It arrived in about 20 minutes. Mongolian Beef. We added vegetables and they were very accommodating  Vegetable egg rolls are delish. Packed with veggies. Hot sour soup is awesome.  I would recommend this restaurant. Try it..."}
{"text":"The restaurant has never closed.  They were on vacation.  The service friendly. The family meal is the best offer."}
{"text":"Pretty good! I'll definitely be back! I'm not even a Chinese food fan, and this was good! Portions are good size, chow mein is solid, and the garlic broccoli is a must! Not a fan of how they cook their Kung Pao chicken, but it was still good. Prices are very reasonable also. Glad they opened up in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for the first time on a Tuesday night at 5pm. Told it would be 30 minutes, it took 40. Ordered pork fried rice, sesame chicken, and kung pao chicken for $25. When the delivery guy arrived, he informed us it was cash only, which would have been good to know when ordering. Everything was bland. There was literally no flavor to any of the dishes. The kung pao chicken had hardly any chicken or peanuts, all vegetables. I have had bar Chinese food that tasted better. I would never order from here again."}
{"text":"Delicious food, always delivered hot and fast. Crab raggoons are ridiculously good and Shrimp with Lobster sauce is very tasty as well."}
{"text":"Good food for such a small price. I took yelpers advice and got the crab Ragoons. They are amazing. The food itself was nothing spectacular but nothing to stick your nose up to either."}
{"text":"We were very pleased.  I love that they had a few Thai dishes to round out their delicious Chinese menu. For me that meant Pineapple fried rice to go with my Kung Poa chicken. For my partner,  an appetizer of Satay Chicken.  The entrées were full of fresh and crispy vegetables with meat that remained fresh and tender. I also appreciated the complete dinner plates so that family style dinners won't always be necessary. Delivery time exceeded expectations.  Thanks for a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"XO is the place! Great prices! Good Food! Great service, take out and delivery too! Love XO!"}
{"text":"The egg foo young was very good.  The owner and staff are very professional with great service.   Everyone in our group thought the food was really good and tasteful."}
{"text":"The generals chicken was not good...the sauce was thin and the chicken was not crispy at all. The crab Rangoon was good. The cashew chicken was chewy and there was too many soggy vegetables. Maybe Chinese is not their strong suit, but I don't think I'll ever order from here again. Fast service though."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese/Thai food I've ever had. Had two bites of my pad Thai and threw it out, chicken was chewy, bean sprouts were mushy, and it had an overpowering taste of lemon. I also got an Appetizer platter and everything was soggy and greasy. I will not be dining there ever again."}
{"text":"Some of the best food ive had in a while. Everything tasted super fresh and the service was awesome. Great atmosphere. Will defiantly be returning to this fine establishment."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars here. Not sure what happened to this place. Maybe they have new ownership but the food quality is now just horrible. Im pretty sure they just microwave their orange chicken. I also ordered chicken pad thai for delivery and when i got it it was litterally a box of chow mein noodles. I called to ask what this is about and she said they put the order in wrong however I am welcome to purchase another order of pad thai..... I dont get it. You know you messed up my order then offer me to pay again for what I originally ordered. I dont whine or go out of my way to post crappy reviews but seriously save yourself the time and money and go pick up something from the frozen isle of Vons before ordering anything from here."}
{"text":"Good, fast Chinese food. I think the owner is the one who takes order, very polite and answered questions about some dishes offered."}
{"text":"I've been going to XO since the opening. I've never had a bad experience. The staff is always friendly. It doesn't matter if I call in for pick up or take out. I've never had to wait extremely long either. My favorite and mostly only dishes I order are the Singapore Noodle, Salt/Pepper shrimp and Orange Chicken. It's always very tasty. Last night I had a craving for Singapore Noodle. Came home from running groceries Smith's. Made a pit stop at XO. Waited 5 minutes for my order. Drove home, unpacked, turned on the TV, sat down in my couch and enjoyed a delicious meal. A happy camper.  Thanks XO."}
{"text":"we go here because it's located down the road from our house.  we're glad that it is there too.  it's a small place, but clean.  we usually get lunch here as theyt have great lunch specials.  portions are pretty good size for the price.  food is tasty.  the only thing they need to work on is the egg rolls.  (however, it's been impossible to find good egg rolls in las vegas...anywhere here)  they are also very quick here.  during the lunch rush, i call in and immediately head over and my food is ready, always less than 15 min.  they are friendly and definitely a great place to check out.  we will continue to go back."}
{"text":"I go here all the time. The food is really good and they have the lunch specials everyday. General tap chicken is really good."}
{"text":"Never again! I thought id give this place a try and I regret it. I eat often at jacky chans but I wanted to try fried rice since that is hard to mess up. I also purchased wonton soup for my husband since he had a sore throat. The soup was not good and the portion I got for the price I paid was not worth it. The rice was too stale. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"I  tried this place cause i was reading the recently good reviews ? But i order delivery and the food was pretty fast Which is why they got 2 stars But other then that this food is absolutely terrible Im not sure where all these people have been eating chinese food before but this experience was awful!! I tried multiple dishes and every dish was so bland and absolutely no flavor at all ?? I dont know if they are cutting back on spices or ingredients ??  Will definitely not be back"}
{"text":"This is a great place for dine-in, delivery, or take-out Chinese food! The restaurant itself is clean, casual, and provides a comfortable environment to hang and eat for however long. The prices are reasonable and portions are generous.  My favorite is their Szechuan garlic chicken extra spicy with white rice. They provide plenty of meat so that you're not fishing through too many veggies to find it. The chicken fried rice is also good because it isn't too greasy. I'm normally not a big fan of fried rice but I enjoyed the one here. I also recommend their wonton soup... hearty and comes with quality wontons (not the yellow, Americanized kinds), and the broth isn't too salty like most other places.  Staff is friendly and helpful... (we all know this is not the case for most Chinese restaurants). They're also lenient with menu modifications so if you like your dish extra spicy or enjoy baby corn the way I do, they will not have a problem making these adjustments. :) Overall I definitely recommend this place for a meal that's quick, cheap, filling, and enjoyable."}
{"text":"XO to their peppersteak with onions:     If \"XO\" means hugs and kisses. Then I say XO to their peppersteak with onions. It is this XO to their peppersteak with onions that has brought me to the XO Chinese Restaurant (abbreviated XO) a few times the last couple of years.     XO is located in a shopping center at the southwest corner of Blue Diamond Road and Cimarron in the Mountain West community. Sitting in this location it is in the shadow of Exploration Park Mountain. It was after hiking up the Exploration Park Mountain (also called Shoelace) that I found out about XO. For the record Yelp was the guide that led me there.     I don't like repeating myself, however, I want to spread the word that the Chinese Restaurant lunch special is one of the best deals around. From the first time I visited XO after Exploration Park to today after Red Rock Canyon, I took advantage of the XO lunch special.     The XO lunch special, as seen in one of the pictures proceeding the review features fifteen different dishes ranging from $5.69 to $6.99. In my case, there is one item that I order. It is the peppersteak with onions (I will return to the peppersteak with onions shortly).     The dining environment is more Chinese Take Out with tables than full service restaurant. When I have ordered from XO, it was off a pamphlet outside the restaurant or at the counter. If I opted out of a pamphlet menu, I could order off a large wall menu that takes up a large part of the left wall. There is no XO to interior design even though it was closed a short time for refurbishment. With each experience, I'd order and pay at the counter, fill up my twenty ounce soft drink then wait for the person that accepted my money to deliver my food in a styrofoam bucket dish. While waiting for my food, I'd sip a Pepsi soft drink that I poured in the 20 ounce cup while overhearing the TV above. On today's visit I overheard \"Family Guy.\"      Everytime, that I worked on the peppersteak with onion lunch combination ($6.59 plus $1.25 for 20 ounce soft drink), it was obvious that everything they served was outstanding. My styrofoam bucket plate was a representation of quality. Representing quality was fried rice, an egg roll, and the peppersteak with onions. Regardless of how diminutive the egg roll is, the taste is gargantuan. The fried rice exceeds the quality of quite a few Las Vegas Chinese restaurants. As far as the main dish, one more time I write \"xo to the peppersteak with onions.\" Before wrapping up my experience with their food, I need to bring up that XO is one of the few Chinese Restaurant lunch specials excluding soup.     In conclusion, XO gives hugs and kisses to their peppersteak with onions and most likely other dishes. It is a hugs and kisses that has created exceptional peppersteak with onions that has been an afternoon delight that  skyrocketed my taste buds in flight during the lunch special. \"XO\" to their peppersteak with onions, fried rice, and egg roll."}
{"text":"Junk food masquerading as take out Chinese.  Really tasteless, small portions, veggies were undercooked and the chicken looked suspiciously meager.  Their \"hot garlic sauce\" required generous soy and chili from me to be palatable.  Strange location as well - probably mostly serving the huge apartment complex across the way, but not much else in terms of neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is my go to chinese fast food joint..food is good to taste and very conveniently located in my neighborhood delivery is also available."}
{"text":"I always get the same things, almond chicken and bbq pork fried rice. My favorite dishes. My MIL and husband get the sesame chicken and an order of rangoon. I prefer this resturant over a couple others in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome Chinese food in Southwest...I haven't had better take-out in Vegas yet.  And yes, I do think this place is better than PF Changs  My favorite dish is the Szechuan Hot Garlic Chicken...the fried rice and noodles are really good too.  I'm not a huge fan of thier soup but you can't have everything....  The staff is always friendly, prices are fair, your food comes out fast, and it tastes great!  I'm just sorry I can't go there as often any more since I moved across town..."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to my chicken fried rice so I ordered online & specifically asked for no onion & light oil. When I got home I started eating and tasted ONION but that wasn't the worst part. All the chicken was inedible!! Slimy and rubbery!! I tried another piece of chicken...disgusting!! I had to throw the whole thing away and I lost my appetite for the entire day. I DO NOT recommend this place & will never go back again!!"}
{"text":"Bomb chinese food, great hospitality services and always on time with their deliveries. If you're on the South west part of Vegas highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a convenient pickup meal on the way home yesterday from work and decided to check yelp for some highly rated chinese food in our area. Up pops XO. Now, I have to say I definitely use yelp more and more now to determine where I am going to go and what I am going to do when I get there. The reviews for this place were high and XO did not disappoint. We ordered a family dinner, so we could get some appetizers to go along with our meal and be more cost effective. So we ordered the BBQ pork fried rice with dinner which was excellent, won ton soup (also really yummy with lots of won tons unlike other places where with 2-4 ppl you get one won ton a piece usually), egg rolls, and chicken skewers with a nice lemony sorta sauce. We also got the Orange Chicken and the Crispy Almond chicken by Yelp recommendation as well. Id say the Orange Chicken was my fave in the dinner as unlike most chinese restaurants, the chicken was super crispy and covered in the orange sauce. My bff loved the Almond Chicken and sauce. In addition to the food being awesome when we got home, it took less than 10 minutes from ordering to get our order. They also deliver so we will be checking that out next time. Thank you yelpers for such a great suggestion.  PS me & my dog loved it - see Isabella Y's review ;)"}
{"text":"Super fast and friendly delivery, but the food was super blah and greasy. We ordered both the BBQ pork fried rice and the BBQ Pork lo mein, along with sweet and sour chicken, garlic chicken and beef and broccoli....just all \"meh\"...New to the neighborhood and based on reviews was willing to give it a try, but unfortunately, will not be going back. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and super hot when it arrived. We had to let it cool off for a few minutes and man was it good! We had the beef and broccoli, orange chicken and chicken fried rice, large amount for Small sizes.   Delivery was about 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Yep I gave them 5. For one thing it's the only place in or around this side of town that makes real pork fried rice, not just fried rice with pork. The chicken noodle soup is good also. Every time I order its good food. That's a rare thing in this town full of restaurants."}
{"text":"Food was great! Service was amazing! Eat there a lot & food is always yummy! Definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"You know how every cheap Asian takeout place with huge portions always taste the same? And you think you know what you're getting and even still you're disappointed by how not good it is? That's what I expected here but I was pleasantly surprised. Every bite was tastier and richer and had one more level of flavor than every other cheap place. You know how most egg rolls are one glob or soggy mushy veggie goop in the middle? Not here. Real, crunchy cabbage. Crab Rangoon usually just a bunch of flavorless cream cheese? Not here. Flavorful and crunchy. Literally every bite was better than I expected. Go! It's good!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite lazy night delivery places.  The food is always delicious, the people are friendly and the delivery very fast.  My kids love the donuts, we are always ordering extras."}
{"text":"Quick take out and fast delivery. Food is always consistently wonderful. The reviewer who said he was sick with fever and chills and gastric issues.... could be food born illness, but sounds like the flu to me. My family and I have been eating here for more than 5 years and have never had a negative experience."}
{"text":"Middle of the road chinese food. I've had most of the chicken dishes and Thai soup. Satisfied with both but doesn't blow me away. They are quick and the portions are big for the price. I'd take this any day over the fast food Chinese place."}
{"text":"I always order my food here for family /party potlucks! never a disappointment!! Call and you get your food on time!!"}
{"text":"Don't order lunch special or dinner special here. Instead, order their regular menu. Why? Because lunch specials ARE cheap so u get what u pay for, there's no effort at their specials at all. On the brighter side, their salt and pepper fish is the only reason why I'm giving them 3 stars and the reason why I keep ordering to them. (Oh, and because their service is quick)"}
{"text":"6 months in a row! I have ordered food from XO at least twice a month for 6 months in a row. Every dish so far has been Amazing! They have great service....Great good....Amazing delivery service! Orange chicken is fresh and white meat! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese delivery for Mountains Edge. These friendly people are the fastest delivery and the food quality is consistently good and always hot. The other nearby places are hit and miss."}
{"text":"Food was meh nothing exciting. Ordered my kung pao extra hot and it wasn't spicy at all. I don't think I'll order from here again. It was kind of a bummer because I eat Chinese all the time it's my favorite food"}
{"text":"One of the worst Chinese food I have ever had ...very greasy and really doesn't have any taste to it"}
{"text":"This place never fails to amaze! I brought my brother here and, although the were almost closing, the food was fresh and very tasty. The best Chinese food in the southwest!"}
{"text":"Service is horrible! We went there for dine in. Place is hot and no hello or anything! Lady was so damn rude.... We ordered: almond chicken, duck and honey walnut shrimp...$35!  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I have ordered take out from this location a handful of times and have always loved the quality and quantity of food along with their friendly, efficient service. I dined in today during lunch.. ordered their general tso's lunch special (mind you, I've had this dish multiple times from this location)... I was given the heavily breaded chicken which is used for their (sweet and sour chicken dish) just doused in general tso's sauce, making it quite soggy and unappetizing. I brought it to the cashiers attention as to that's not the dish I am accustomed to. He snapped at me and straight out yelled across the dining room that I am wrong. I held my plate up to the wall menu pictures pointing out the difference of chicken texture between the sweet and sour chicken and general tso's chicken dishes. He still insisted that I was wrong. I asked to order Mongolian beef instead because I don't care for the heavily breaded/fried chicken dish doused in general tso's sauce.. he took my plate and replied he will bring me a \"Mongolian chicken\".. I corrected him that I asked for beef and he told me I owe him $1.. SERIOUSLY DUDE?! I'll happily bring my business elsewhere.   I'm a general tso's chicken connoisseur.. and I know general tso's chicken when I see it!  That, my friend... WAS NOT GENERAL TSO'S CHICKEN!   Still mad I didn't take a picture!   Got my refund and bounced on out of there! Never again, never again.   If you're still looking for a good Chinese spot, check out Baidu China Bistro on Rainbow & Robindale!"}
{"text":"Always the best service with authentic tasting Chinese food and quick delivery. Plus the delivery guy I think his name was Bruce is such a cutie."}
{"text":"Okay so I moved to the South West from Summerlin.  I was told to try this restaurant. My first visit was not a good visit, the food was very greasy and did not taste good at all.  however, I tried a second time. Chicken and broc was a lot better the second time. Very large pieces of chicken and broc. the customer service both times were great, they treated me very nice and helped me with the menu.  I will be trying it a third time to see how I want to rate this place, as I am currently 50/50 on my take out.  Lets add that the price is right on with the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Love the pork fried rice. It reminds me of the pork fried rice I used to get back when I used to live in NYC. I always order from them especially after long nights out with my friends, XO Chinese has a delicious, hot, light soup called Wor Wonton Soup which contains veggies, chicken, shrimp, wontons and pork. Mmmm. Great hangover remedy. Until I move out of mountains edge, XO Chinese will always be my spot."}
{"text":"This place is our new go to spot for Chinese.  They offer fast service with good food. They aren't rude but not friendly. Maybe it the cultural differences.  The portion sizes are good."}
{"text":"The staff was very pleasant and helped me find the perfect order for my kids that they loved. The food was delicious and very fresh and good environment"}
{"text":"Picked up our food rather than delivery. Purchased the Family Dinner soup was good & hot when we brought the food home. Nice variety of appetizers. Main course was a generous portion. I would order from here again"}
{"text":"TRY THE HONEY WALNUT SHRIMP!   I've been coming here for YEARS, I love that they're a mom & pop owned business who genuinely value guest satisfaction!!!! They've always been nice, warm and very greeting! It honestly adds to the whole experience! The food here is incredible, I try to get different things every time but sometimes I can't help but indulge in my favorites such as almond chicken, honey walnut shrimp and orange chicken  the place is very clean and the delivery is quick if I feel like being lazy and ordering delivery instead of dining in  My girlfriend and I love ordering from them all the time! You'll enjoy it!!!!"}
{"text":"I do like this place a lot. Its across the street and is always there whenever my stomach is in the mood for some spicy Lo Mein (you have to ask for it Spicy but its delicious if you do)  My GF and her daughter love the place as well and always fight over the leftovers they have.  We will be back and who knows I may just try something other than their Lo Mein."}
{"text":"Always great service and the food is made to order!! Large portions and lots of protein in every dish - I tried the Mandarin Style Pork chops this time - I highly recommend it !!!"}
{"text":"I would have given them a better rating as their prices and portions beat China A Go Go by a long stretch but there are a few problems. Firstly I hate when Chinese restaurants advertise spring rolls as \"egg rolls\", which is a traditional Hunan dish that was Americanised and Europeanised (yes we have/had them in Europe too) but for some reason the tide turned against deep fried food and spring rolls largely replaced egg rolls. Egg rolls are deep fried, larger and usually have an assorted vegetable (chopped not stringy) and meat filling, usually pork. These are really hard to find. Reading \"egg roll\" on their menu made me salivate, literally-I love egg rolls.   The next problem is that for me I love Lo Men (Chow Mien) noodles, they did an amazing job and this dish was large, in a traditional Chinese take-away box and absolutely perfect.   I am trying to wrap my head around how what was once called \"Peking Ravioli\" became \"pot stickers\" but apparently in Nevada they are pot stickers. In Europe and I know on the East Coast in USA too the term Peking Ravioli still prevails, I can accept the change of terminology and they did a great job with these as well--PORK. I do not know why so many Chinese restaurants have gone over to chicken, it is not the traditional way to cook these nor is it good. They made really good \"pot stickers\". (BTW \"dumplings\" is another word that used to describe these, ie \"pork dumplings, fried or steamed\").   Where they struck out was the Szechuan Beef dish. It was not my dish but I did examine and eat a bit of it as my husband said there was no meat in it all Chinese vegetables as filler-and he was 100% correct. Good luck trying to find the beef in that dish. To top it off it was not the least bit spicy.   I would get Lo Mein and perhaps the pork dumplings again but would be hesitant to get much more."}
{"text":"Nice little Chinese food place in a strip mall as you're leaving Vegas heading west toward Red Rock Canyon and Bonnie Springs. It looks like a nice little family place and I thought I'd give it a try and see how it went. I had moved off of the big Vegas scene and was heading for the country in a very countrified Motel. I was happy to see they were open late in the evening although 8:30 might not be too late for some. But it looked to me like this end of town would close up pretty soon. It's definitely not the strip in Las Vegas. The people were very cheerful and we're processing to-go orders like wildfire. I guess that getting it delivered can be a real Plus for some people. Anyway I ordered up and sat down and had barely been there for just a few minutes and Presto overcame my kung pao chicken and my pot stickers. I said wow is that fast. She said you look hungry I cooked you first. I say thank you and what a wonderful joy that was. Now I have to say the pot stickers were thin skin which I liked, a bit crispy which I like and had a nice feeling which I liked. The Kung Pao chicken was so so, with a lot of vegetables and me chasing around to find the chicken. It served what I needed for dinner, and I know I had plenty to eat, and thank you very much is about all I have to say."}
