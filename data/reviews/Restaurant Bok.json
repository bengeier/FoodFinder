{"text":"Literally the best korean&Chinese fusion restaurant in Montreal. I came here as an international student from korea, and I always come here whenever I miss the original taste of my home country's food. The restaurant also serves very good quality tea so if you are a tea lover, you should try here. The owner and the staffs are really nice and friendly, the owner, she has the warmest smile ever. I highly recommend this restaurant, everything the food, the service are always excellent. You will never be disappointed!"}
