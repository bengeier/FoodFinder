{"text":"Small Korean bar with of course soju!  

Ordered a $25 special which comes with 1 bottle of soju and a platter of fried pork and chicken cutlet.  This platter was pretty huge, we didn't finish but it's great for sharing!  The pork was a bit on the dry side tho'.  Note:  Soju and food specials are in Korean so not knowing how to read Korean, we had to be a bit resourceful.  (Or, you can ask the servers!)

Appetizers come with your order, which is pretty standard for Korean bars.  Cabbage salad with squid, mashed potato, cold broccoli drizzled with hot sauce.

Drink selection is not that extensive, no soju mixes on the menu so if you're looking for that, this might not be the place for you. 

Overall, a nice place, decent service.  Decor is modern, it's a bit dark inside but it is a bar.  Not really a place for big groups tho' unless you can arrive early."}
{"text":"I 've been here once but their fried chicken was very good and tasty, beyond my expectation. It didn't smell any greasy oil but fresh and crispy even though I was full already. I'm not sure it was only that day but their food quality was better than any other average restaurants, especially for fried chicken."}
{"text":"The service was decent,  however I felt that given it wasn't a busy night,  they could've checked us on a bit more. When you order just drinks it comes with 3 sides on the house (potato salad,  edamame,  and broccoli with spicy sauce)."}
{"text":"Little cozy korean restaurant/bar located beside MENAME. Very Low visual lights with bit catchy musics. Foods are not bad. It is just enough place to hangout with friends. I would recommand whole chicken, half sweet and spicy."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to hang out with a small group of friends.. place seats about 40 ppl at full capacity.. 

Came here Bar hopping on a Friday night..  not really good for large groups.. mostly for groups of 2 or 4 ppl type of mech tables..

Waitress and waiter was friendly.. 

3 stars cuz it's not the liveliest in the area.... menani and hashi are bigger and more atmosphere.. 

Would revisit this place tho"}
