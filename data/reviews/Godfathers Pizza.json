{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. We ordered 4 pizzas and were told it would be 45-60 minutes. At one hour we called and were told 10 more minutes. At an hour and a half we called and were told any minute now. At 2 hours we called again and they called the driver, who arrived about 10 minutes later. It wouldn't have mattered if we had gotten \"pizza\". Instead we got something that made us all sick. The buffalo chicken pizza had no buffalo sauce on it - in fact no sauce at all. Order from another pizza place, unless you like chewy dough and salt."}
{"text":"Ordered a suprime pizza and a half pound hamburger. The pizza hardly had any toppings and no sauce and was cold when it got here. The hamburger was not even close to being a half pound. It was a cold patty and lettuce that's it..."}
{"text":"They called to say my pizza would be later than the 45 minutes they originally advised.  I'm okay with that except my pizza arrived cold.  Microwaved pizza just isn't good.  Especially when 1 pizza is $25.  Not worth the price by any stretch I'd recommend a chain over them sadly. At least your bad pizza would be cheap that way."}
{"text":"Best pizza on this side of the Mississippi. We always make a stop at Love's just for Godfathers. Amazing."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

This Godfathers Pizza is attached to Love's Travel Stop. There is a separate entrance at the front or you can enter through the convenient store. The inside is clean and they have plenty of seating. You can order specialty pizzas or create your own. The \"mini\" pizzas are baked, packaged and ready for sale. I was skeptical at first, but they looked fresh and not like they had been sitting there long. The regular size pizzas are made fresh to order so you can always call them ahead of time and place your order so it's ready when you arrive. This is pretty convenient for anyone who is looking to pick up a quick dinner on the way back into town since there aren't many options in the area. This visit I had a \"Cheese Pizza\" (mini) that was priced at $3.49 before tax. I was happy with the price considering this is a known chain and it is hooked to a gas station, so I thought the prices would be higher. My pizza was hot, fresh and tasted better than average. You have to pay for your food at the Godfathers or Subway registers inside their area, you cannot take the food into the convenient store and pay for it there. They also have calzones, wings and cinnamon streusel for dessert."}
{"text":"If it was possible it would definitely be ZERO stars. I'm so very surprised this restaurant is still in business. I ordered 2 chicken Cesar Salads. I understand this is Vegas & this is a pizza place but come on! How hard is it to make a Cesar? Romaine, chicken (usually grilled), parmesan shavings and that's about it. Instead I got a styrofoam container of ice berg letter with cut up old chicken strips & a pound of croutons. 

A fast food joint could have done better.  Fast food joints DO better. When I called the location to ask them what exactly it was they sent me, I got horrible customer service. If the fiasco of a meal wasn't bad enough we can add the delivery driver they sent. He didn't look old enough to drive, didn't have a pen and seemed to have a hard time understand basic English. 

$21.00 ($24.50 including tip) for absolutely nothing. I think not. Save yourself money and aggravation and totally avoid this place. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"This pizza was amazing!! And by amazing I mean it failed to meet even my rock bottom expectations of a truck stop parasitic business. I almost wish I had gnawed on cardboard as a kid so that this meal would have seemed edible. Unfortunately though I also overpaid to be this disappointed. The last time I overpaid to be disappointed,  my girlfriend said no to an overly small engagement ring. So disappointing that I'm even REVIEWING A TRUCK STOP PIZZA PLACE. Good god-fathers it sucked... just get something in Vegas or wait till you get there.. or maybe chew on some napkins."}
{"text":"I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible. Called in to order and was told it'd arrive within 45 mins. 2 he's passed and we didn't receive anything. Guy on the phone had the audacity to tell us delivery man was downstairs at our hotel and due to \"hotel policies\" he couldn't come up to our room they could only do one at a time. So I went downstairs and surprise surprise...no delivery guy was there I asked concierge and they didn't know of any delivery guy \"waiting\" to deliver. So I called again to cancel and the guy on the phone RUDELY said \"okay but if you don't leave a note we will charge your room\" DONT BELIEVE THEM! They can't do that!"}
{"text":"As far as I know there's only one of these in Las Vegas and that's way up North at a Truck Stop on the outskirts of Vegas. I made the drive as there's one of these back home and I needed to find the taco pizza. The only complaint I have is that they did not have sour cream for the taco pizza I even went into the truck stop to try and buy some but they did not sell it either."}
{"text":"The pizza is the best pizza I've had in a long time. I wanna drive back out there and have more.  
Every time someone mentions pizza I crave godfathers

The wait times are about 25 minutes. They were really busy but it was worth the wait for us!!
I wish they had more in town because this location is far from our house outside of Vegas."}
