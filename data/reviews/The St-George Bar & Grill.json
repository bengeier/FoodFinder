{"text":"Wings are pretty good on tuesday as it is half price. They don't have too many flavours. I don't know if i would go any other days except for half price wing nights.  Service and food is decent"}
{"text":"Always a favourite with my entire family. Authentic British food. The massive Yorkshire tastes like my mums. Belly buster fish n chips is amazing. Best wings! They're huge! Great staff. We had an issue with a reservation for a birthday. Staff handled it well. Although we didn't make a complaint the owner contacted me and offered complimentary meal for same number of guest. Feels like home when we are there. Love the george!"}
{"text":"First time visitor on Friday with a group of six.  Nice atmosphere.  First draught beers (Coors Light) were dead flat.  Wait staff was a disappointment.  When asked what she'd recommend as an entree couldn't offer any real suggestions.  Then forgot order of appetizers. And later botched three bills.  The 'cajun sandwich' was nothing to rave about and something I wouldn't order again(despite being the one item the server did recommend).  And the 'bread pudding' was definitely not bread pudding by my definition/experience but rather some sort of brought in toffee cake.   I'd go again for a beer, but not for a meal."}
{"text":"Went in on Halloween night around 9:20pm in some tastefully cute costumes with a couple friends. Multiple servers acknowledge us as we sat there awkwardly for 20 minutes. As a server approaches a table near by she says \"hello\" and walked away. We proceeded to sit there for another 10 minutes, no service. Walked out. Completely dissatisfied."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!! The Steak & Mushroom Pie had super tender steak, big mushrooms, and VERY flavorful gravy!!! The poutine had great gravy and melty cheese curds! Great place for authentic local cuisine and GREAT service!!!!!!!!"}
