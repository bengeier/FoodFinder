{"text":"After a few jack and cokes from Hennessey's Tavern, Cheffinis Hot Dogs definitely hit the spot. $3 for a hot dog with whatever toppings you want?! Deal! Make sure to get EVERYTHING and have them put the toppings under the hot dog if you want a less messy late night snack."}
{"text":"Veggie dogs are really good. They have cool toppings and its all pretty yummy. Even one with a fried quail egg on top.   I love container park, you can sit outside and eat your hot dog, and it is a nice view of the central playground. Adults are allowed on the slide too haha.  One star off because the veggie dog gave me that extra heavy/groggy feeling. I know its a hot dog. But i thought since it was a veggie dog, i wouldnt feel that sluggish after eating it"}
{"text":"Had this last night and it was fantastic! My boyfriend has not stopped talking about it. I thought the prices were fair for what you get which is a gourmet hotdog. I had the El Mexicano and did everything but lick the paper clean. My boyfriend had the grandfather and it was also great. This is the place to eat hotdogs in Vegas. We also got to meet the owner and the chief. They were very nice and told us how they got started. Best late night food I have had in awhile :)"}
{"text":"Best Hot Dogs in town so far!!! You guys should open a Hot Dog truck soon that way you guys can open early!!!"}
{"text":"I only tried their signature hotdog, but that was enough for me to give them my 2 thumbs up. The unique ingredient combinations taste phenomenal! Great place!"}
{"text":"Great dogs!!  Tons of toppings, some of which take away from the dog itself, but with a knife and fork, you can pick the toppings in the order you want them."}
{"text":"The location at container park had horrible service. Their employee (heavyset woman with short brown hair tied into a ponytail) was extremely rude. My friends and I got there 45 minutes till closing and she sighed and told her coworkers, \"let me lock the door before they keep coming.\" As we looked through the menu she sighed and kept asking us if we had decided what we wanted.  This was our first time eating there so we wanted to look at everything.  After we got our hotdogs she locked the door 30 minutes till closing and started serving customers from the slide door. She was rude to them as well. I really hope she gets her attitude in check!  If people don't like their jobs, they should leave!"}
{"text":"This place looks busy, so my friend and I decided to order a cheffines hot dog. it was the worst hot dog ever. The bun, hot dog and cheese were cold. The feeling of cold cheese texture on top of my cold bun is horrible. The wait to prepare this hot dog was 10 mins. I only ate 1/4 of the hot dog and toss the rest in the trash. I've could of done a better frank hot dog at home."}
{"text":"Great service. Great menu. I love the salchipapa? I'm pretty sure that's what it's called. Not a hotdog fan but love this little joint"}
{"text":"Food is good just way over priced. It takes a little longer than I'd expect to get a hot dog."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I usually have a plan hot dog but this place takes hot dog to a whole other level. Can't remember the name of the h o t dogs we ordered but they were all good and the sweet potato fries was wonderful. I can eat here weekly, wish parking wasn't such a hassle. Hate the thought of having to factor in the cost for parking just to enjoy a bite here."}
{"text":"I love supporting businesses with vegan options. But the service was terrible, there's a few things I can let pass, but they way they treat their customers is unacceptable. I simply asked to have my order to-go, they then asked where I will be. I explained I would be walking around until my order was ready. I was then rudely told \"that's not to go\", dumbfounded by their response, I proceeded to explain that my order would be to go, I would be walking around while I waited. (I've been there a couple of times and have found that the food is often slow to come out, which is fine, I just plan accordingly.) They then hand me a my number with a metal stick attached to it, I explained I would be walking around the container park, and asked if I could just hold on to the number, once again I was rudely told: \"you HAVE to just walk around with that stick\". I work in the service industry, I understand why dining in or to-go orders are important, but there are ways of approaching customers."}
{"text":"My wife and I had these hot dogs last night. Absolutely delicious!!!!! All toppings r free, n nicely presented for a 3.00 hot dog. Definitely a must for late night munchies"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic, fresh tasting snack in the middle of a hot day.  I got to sample both the El Mexicano and the Crunchy and enjoyed them both.  Both hot dogs had a lot going on, but the components played well together and were done well."}
{"text":"By far the best dog I've ever had....just walked by and decided to stop in....more of a curious hunger stop. And I suggest it fo sho!!!!!"}
{"text":"The hot dogs are pretty good. It's not a cheap date. I still say the Bulldogies is the best Hot Dog in Vegas!!   The fries are also pretty good!! If your downtown this is one of the better container park restaurants."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing gourmet about this junk. Dogs are mediocre at best, toppings are costco crap, buns are stale. Fries are just toxic oil soaked potatoes....Service is fast food poor. Took one bite and threw it all in the trash with my money. Please close this place and make room for a better biz here."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but the service has continuously declined.  The staff is rude and seem to be inconvenienced when you order from them.  Also, there is no communication between the staff so one person tells you to wait anywhere and the other berates you for not staying nearby.  If they are that unhappy, perhaps they should find employment elsewhere.  Definitely makes for an uncomfortable experience."}
{"text":"I was not expecting to find a hot dog from a cart this good. And never in my mind right about putting pineapple on my hot dog. I can't wait to go to the actual store when it opens today to try some more."}
{"text":"As I was walking down Freemont Street I came across this joint.  I kinda looked in and the guy making the hot dogs was super cool, so I thought I'd grab two to go and take back to my room.  I have no idea what kind of hot dog I ordered, I just said I want what she got since it looked so good.  It was kinda pricy for what you got, but it was OK.  I tipped the guy $20 just because he was working so hard and still having a great time.  Next time I'll actually look at a menu.  :-)"}
{"text":"This is the food cart Cheffini's in front of The Beat, not the one in the Container Park.  Hot dog, with onions, tomatoes, relish, potato chips, peppers, mustard and ketchup.  Perfect at 1am after a few beverages."}
{"text":"Got the beer + dog combo. Being vegan, I was happy to see all the vegan options.   The hot dog was decent and the price was not bad for also getting a beverage.  Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure the bun was not vegan. I don't have a photo of it because it was dark outside, but the bun was *bright yellow* -- and if you've been vegan for a while, you'll know it's important to stay away from yellow breads (hamburger buns, hot dog buns, dinner rolls, whatever). That usually means the bread contains egg. And this bad boy definitely had that eggy look.  If Cheffinis wants to let me know otherwise, I'd be happy to correct my review!"}
{"text":"I did a review on this hot dog establishment back in 2014 and since then I have experienced excellent hot dogs. But I found out this winter when I returned that they don't serve milk shakes from October to May.... Well what is a hot dog without a milkshake. It appears I will only be visiting the hot dog stand during the summer months from here on in."}
{"text":"Best hot dog I've ever had. This hot dog cart puts onions, jalapeños, cheese, chips, mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and pineapple on a dog and it's only $4 but the best food to walk around with after bar hopping Fremont!"}
{"text":"After all the glowing reviews I figured this hot dog joint was going to be my new favorite place. I had a bacon wrapped hot dog and the bun and bacon were both hard. How in the heck can a hot dog alone with no drink or side cost over $8? I could see if it were a footlong hot dog but this was just an average size hot dog. The girls working were nice but I have definitely experienced better hot dogs other places for far less in price and much better in taste."}
{"text":"I assume these guys want to go out of business. Staying open and servicing customers til your restaurant closes is a good way to show you care about staying in business. 45 min before your close time and the kitchen is closed and all chairs stacked on the tables. No visible pricing. Guy at the window clearly displeased at having to do work. Nice place ya got there. Hope the hot dog stand is on Fremont cus I'd rather eat from street food vendors who give a crap where their next dollar can be made."}
{"text":"Four stars for flavor, two stars for service, averaging to three but they have the potential to improve.   CLASSIC CHEFFINIS: Grilled frank, onions, tomatoes, jalapeños, mozzarella, crushed potato chips, pineapple sauce, mustard, mayo and ketchup. $6 for a gigantic dog overflowing with toppings that didn't sound like they'd work, but somehow harmonized. Didn't expect to like the pineapple sauce, but I did.  MOSHI MOSHI: Grilled frank, caramelized onions, seaweed, jalapeño, wine sauce, spicy mayo. I love a good Japanese dog, this one was simple. Asked for it sans jalapenos and received a rather sad-looking dog with very few onions, but flavor was good. $7 price tag seems appropriate for the area and toppings.  Now for the service. Walked in to one person in line waiting for a drink refill. Through the kitchen window we could see the cook hard at work, but the cashier was nowhere to be found for a solid five minutes and the cook never acknowledged anyone waiting as the line grew to five more people. Eventually the cashier popped up and started handling the customers, but she seemed overwhelmed and flustered, forgetting to box takeout orders and other minor oversights."}
{"text":"This restaurant is hidden inside a charming open shopping area. After locating it we ordered our gourmet hot dogs. We did have to wait awhile before getting them, but once they arrived it was a tasty hotdog. Enjoyed the food!   The only negative is you had to pay for parking and we arrived on a weekend day and the flat rate was $15."}
{"text":"Love this place! We bring any visitors that come from out of town here. My husband and I say \"want to try the best hot dog in Las Vegas?\" And It never fails! Everyone loves this place! It is a bit small (but then again it's container park) but there is enough seating outside. We are from Chicago, where some of the best hot dogs in the world are, it takes a lot to please our pallets. And this place always hits the spot. Always unique in there menu, and fries are delicious!"}
{"text":"If you're near downtown Las Vegas and looking for something fun to eat, Cheffini's hot dog cart is unbeatable. The guy running the cart is affable and entertaining, and the dogs are spot-on. There are a number of non-traditional topping available for the dogs (potato chips, anyone), so you can customize to your stomach's content. Plus, the clientele provides a show of its own.  Great place!"}
{"text":"This is the best hot dog in town! I mean $3 bucks is well worth paying for just one bite off one of these dogs! Specially if u put all topping plus pineapple dressing, that's a must! Very cool spot across from \"common wealth\" good spot to stop by before or after having a couple of drinks around Fremont. Also very convenient for all of us that don't carry cash and use plastic all the time they accept that also. These dogs rule! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Went to get my daughter a hot dog so I ordered the $8 special which according to the sign said hot dog and drink.....can't remember what else but it doesn't matter.  Cashier rudely told me that it was $16 and some change.....I asked her why and she said I ordered a hot dog and a special........I said no, that was one special with ketchup, mustard and relish on the hot dog. Her response was we don't do it that way sir.....BTW I am a Transgender woman!  I simply said I had ordered it that way before and she very rudely stated well not here you didn't and we ain't doin that way now.......so I left.! Living here in the Downtown Community it was very disturbing to see this type of rude uncalled for behavior......they are the same way in the attached coffe shop.  Very non supportive to the LGBT Community and I do believe this was discriminating to a certain degree....... Much better service a block down the street at FLIPPIN' GOOD Burgers and Fries"}
{"text":"Updated: 2/27/15  No Chili??  C'mon guys, you have to have chili all day - not run out in the afternoons.  We went tonight for the chili dog and no chili.  No take out menus, no sweet potato fries - and we got there at 5:30pm to have dinner.  Really need to be more organized, seemed short staffed, and need to increase your food supply for the day and night.  BUT, still great service and I had the El Mexicano hot dog instead and it was delicious.  We love this place and hope it can stand the test of time.  They were very busy, but lots of people left.  We are rooting for you!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered their El Mexicano Hot Dog, it got all kinds of goodies on it, plus it's bacon wrapped!! Their sauce tasted super good, I m a fan after my first bite!! Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"I can always count on Cheffini's to conquor my drunken states of hunger! Hot Dog with the Everything and Pineapple sauce! MMM ! $3!!!"}
{"text":"One of the most memorable food experiences in my life. Everything was perfect. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"5 stars baby. Not because it's fine dining..because its the BEST hot dog /fixins you will ever eat! I'm a anti processed meat, health food nut & even I cannot deny my mouth the amazing mix of warm/cold/crunchy/soft yumminess of cheffinis!"}
{"text":"My husband and mom really liked this place! My mom commented on the creativity of the hotdogs. My husband found the hotdogs very tasty. The only real seating is outdoors, though, so be prepared for the weather."}
{"text":"Cheffini is a Genius. Thats what. Giving the people what they need.Delicious Hotdogs, creative toppings, Dirt Cheap, and Right where you need them. On the fremont (east) street.  Its 2am, the last band just finished up at the beauty bar, you're spinning from the drinks. Eat a couple before going to bed and you wont have a hangover in the morning. *  *results may vary."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the sliders and french fries. The French fries and fry sauce we're good, but the sliders were weird. It was like they were a mix of beef and sausage or something (they were like red inside) mixed with green onions and some weird seasonings. We didn't try the hotdogs so can't comment on those, but I definitely wouldn't recommend the sliders."}
{"text":"I had the Cheffinis dog with a PBR. Best hot dog I've had. Service was great. I'd go again! A little crowded inside, almost a box, encourages outside dining. A bigger establishment would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Had The Grand Father and empanadas.  It was frigging delishuz. Apparently is impossible to eat a hot dog in one bite without looking brutally gay."}
{"text":"These are NOT gourmet.  My biggest thing is the BUN!!  The bun is a regular bun you can get in any grocery store...white bun.  Why wouldn't you want to step it up a notch and find different types of buns... even a potato bun would work.  It just screams ball park dog's to me.  There are local bread companies that offer an array of breads, cheap too, NOTHING FROZEN!!  This is my second time here and most likely won't be returning.  I think they need to drop the \"gourmet\" part and just be a hot dog joint.  I wouldn't be as disappointed."}
{"text":"When my husband told me he had a craving for hot dogs for lunch, I was not excited.  We were at the Container District in downtown Vegas, and stumbled across Cheffini's Hot Dogs.  He was so excited to get his wish!  Well I am a convert now, their hot dogs are amazing!  We had \"The Mexican\" and the \"Moshi Moshi\".  The Mexican had large slices of fresh avocado on top, and the Moshi had seaweed and was spicy!  We also were excited that they had Lagunitas beer on tap!  A must try!"}
{"text":"I come here primarily for the $5 draft beer. The hot dogs are tasty and the staff is moderately pleasant. This isn't luxury food, but it satisfies cheap eats at container park. You can't take your beer outside of the park and there's no longer seating inside of the establishment. My only complaint is sometimes the draft baris poured in a way that creates extra foam."}
{"text":"Cheffinis is the stoner's answer to the Hot Dog.   Located in Downtown Container Park, attached to the Black Cup Coffee shop. This tube steak eatery provides a different style of dog with available toppings like chorizo bits, pineapple sauce, chimichurri, crushed potato and chipotle guava. Now of course this isn't all on one dog, but a taste of the difference they offer.   I ordered the \"Grandfather\" which is ridiculous. A grilled frank and pork belly, red bell peppers, caramelized onions, crushed potato chips, spicy mayo, basil aioli, pickle mango, topped with a fried quail egg. This was amazing, I loved the pork belly paired with a runny quail egg and the crunch from the potato chips was also nice touch. This was stacked with toppings and I do suggest trying to eat this classic way for at least for one bite, but then grab the fork and knife because it gets messy.   The other dog I tried was the \"Classic Cheffinis\" with, onions, tomatoes, jalapeños, mozzarella, crushed potato chips, pineapple sauce, mustard, mayo and ketchup. A classic dog, but on steroids, there's no way really to eat this with your hands, there's just too many toppings, but they all taste great together. I really enjoyed the Pineapple sauce with the jalapenos and the fresh tomatoes.   The one thing I didn't enjoy was the mozzarella, I usually love mozzarella on everything, but the cheese was cold and not close to being \"melty\" which would have been much better. Cold cheese and hot food, not a great mix.   Good dogs and great area for seating and people watching. Also, the sweet potato fries and fry sauce are the business!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to eat here while visiting container park, and we LOVED the food at Cheffinis! The hot dogs were packed with flavor and very juicy! We had the Chorizo and the Mexicano dogs and they were both delicious.Beer on tap was great, and service was great as well! Definitely recommend this place !"}
{"text":"It just doesn't get better than Cheffinis. The most incredible vegan hot dogs with great toppings. While they have meat dogs - just order the vegan sausage for your friends and they won't know the difference. This is my go to place the minute I hit downtown Vegas."}
{"text":"Hm, guess I'm the only one who just wasn't blown away by this place...  I've had Cheffinis bookmarked for quite a while and after walking by where it's supposed to be at about 11:30, I was pretty disappointed to see they were nowhere to be found. So, we decided to head over to Wayfarer and grab a drink. Luckily, he pulled the cart out not to long after that and we were down there faster than you can say \"hot dog\". Ok, maybe not, but we ran out of that bar quick haha.  Thanks to Mark for reading all the reviews beforehand, he knew to order one with everything underneath the dog itself. That's definitely the best way to go about it if you're ordering everything or a lot of toppings. It keeps everything from falling off the top and you can get nice balanced bite...from what I hear. For whatever reason, I got a super dry bun that crumbled and fell apart making me feed the ground anyway.  Now, I'm usually not a fan of boiled dogs and I believe that's what these are. The flavor is decent but it has that watery feel to it. They are pretty good size dogs though which is appreciated. Who likes a tiny dog in a giant bun?  The topping selection is pretty extensive with everything from the standard ketchup, mustard and onions to some unusual stuff like potato chips, mozzarella cheese and a pineapple sauce. With it loaded up, the flavor is surprisingly good. Even though mine was falling apart a bit, I was able to see how you can get spicy, sweet, salty and even crunchy all in one bite.   Was it the best hot dog I've ever had? No, but I bet when you're about to pass out from hours of alcohol abuse, they taste amazing! I won't go out of my way to come back but next time I'm downtown, I'll definitely grab one and bring cash to save a $1 on the credit card fee!"}
{"text":"So everyone else is eating and I'm waiting, and waiting, and waiting... and no moshi moshi hot dog! So I'm waiting behind this huge German tourist for what seemed like forever, only to find they didn't even take my order! I even annunciated their funky menu item name properly. What gives? At the time, I was the only one in line.  Everything seemed to be going well at first. One of us got the naked dog with a topping and someone had the sweet potatoe fries and they shared both shared a bite while we were waiting. The tastes I had were pretty decent ( if expensive ) so I won't give them one star. But the service was a total bust, hence the generous two stars.   Inside is nice and cool, so grab a seat there if you can. Just double check to make sure they've got your order. Even if as in our case, there was no-one in line behind you. Lame sauce, with no hot dog chaser!"}
{"text":"Yum little hot dog stand in East Fremont.  There really isn't any steak n eggs or pho downtown so what to do the hipsters eat when they get out of Griffin? Hot dogs with chips on them.  Cheffinis is a small stand located across the street from Commonwealth... but I guess it can move around cause well it is on wheels after all. Its the defintion of small business: the owner (I think he is Cheffini) makes a hot dog while his wife/gf/sister/whoknows takes the cash and helps out. Its really cute, and hopefully not Incestious.    Hot dogs are about 3 bux and they come with all kinds of toppings! You can get avocado, cheese, potato chips, and all sorts of random stuff on em. And it all tastes good! I am not a big hot dog fan or any penis shaped food but the toppings and novelty of the whole place make a stop by worth it!"}
{"text":"Beer and hot dog combo was cool. However, I'm not sure any establishment will beat the Costco hotdog. Not due to price but simply due to taste. They top their hot dogs with a bunch of stuff which is cool but in the end, I prefer a standard solid tasting hotdog."}
{"text":"While walking around downtown, I decided to grab a hot dog from here for hubby and I to share. After placing my order I was told it would be just a few minutes. I ended up waiting about 15 minutes for just 1 hot dog because 2 employees were making food for themselves first.   El Mexicano ($6.99) - A bacon wrapped hot dog with avocado, tomato, onion, cherry pepper relish, green sauce, chipotle guava and garlic aioli. This hot dog just had way too much going on for me. Everything on it sounded good, but it didn't work all together. The bacon that was wrapped around the dog was very hard and dry. All I tasted once I was able to chew through the bacon was onions and plain mayo. Apparently sides of sauce are .25 cents each and after looking at my receipt I noticed that I was charged .50 cents for 2 sides of extra sauce. I didn't even ask for anything extra I just wanted the hot dog I ordered. Like the bacon, the bun was hard. My total with tax was $8.10 and that's too much for just one hot dog that didn't even taste good."}
{"text":"Had the Classic Cheffini Hot Dog yesterday and I wasn't a big fan...it was...well, Meh.  The frank was good, but the toppings did not amplify the dog itself.  Mozzarella did not add much to the dog, neither was the crushed potato chips.  I sure didn't taste the different texture as described by what this Classic Cheffini supposed to be.  The pineapple sauce was blah.  Overall, I'd rather eat a chili cheese dog from Sonic."}
{"text":"Found this spot by accident!  And I love it!  They have some amazing beer at this spot.  So the cashier, let us taste a couple of them.  She was so cool.  She's from out in the bush of Alaska, so she had some stories for us!  So I can't even spell or pronounce the name of the beer we liked.  And we ordered there chili dog!  If you don't like spicy/hot stuff, don't get the chilly dog, cause it had some kick!"}
{"text":"Stepping out of Vanguard on our way home, I was kinda hungry , so I grabbed a hot dog from Cheffini's. For $3, you can custom build your dog, so I asked for everything but the Jalapenos.I liked the sweetness of the pineapple with the salty crunch of the crushed potato chips...Definitely hit the spot...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"I've never been inside an actual Cheffinis because I've only ever had it when it's late at night. But the little stand is great because of location. It's right in the middle of downtown so this is the place to go when you're drunk. I usually get everything on my hot dog. The only really unique thing about it is they put potato chips in it, but otherwise it's pretty average. It's just delicious when you're drunk."}
{"text":"Accidentally discovered this place while making my weekly pilgrimage to the downtown bars. Best hot dogs in town by a comfortable margin. Not sure what makes them so good, but it's the best way to start a night of drinking (or without)  Pros: Affordable, Delicious, Conveniently located  Cons: Can't stop at just one"}
{"text":"Love this place! Your food will take a few minutes. So much yum! We had the pork belly hot dogs and they were great. We also had the crunchy dog, wish we had ordered two of those instead of splitting. Small inside but tables out on the deck with the great Container Park for the kids. I vacillate between 4/5 stars, price maybe a touch high for some items."}
{"text":"Good hot dog, but as a food industry person it really bugs me when I hear employees complaining about other employees that aren't there. My husband and I were the only people inside with our 2 year old. 2 girls and a male cook were talking about a co worker for a solid 15 minutes. We weren't talking so we could hear their conversation loud and clear as it is teeny tiny inside. One girl even said the word \"shit\" at least 4 times, again, we have a toddler with us. So unprofessional. Will not be back for this reason alone."}
{"text":"Awesome hot dog stand in the middle of down town. If you are down town jumping from one joint to another this is a great spot to get a cheap snack if you're hungry? My favorite topping was definitely the crumbled potato chips.. Absolutely genius, who knew adding potato chips to a hot dog could add so much texture/crunch, flavor and all that jazz. The guy working the stand is pretty quick and friendly. Although I was a fan, Ryan M. was not but maybe that's because he's from Jersey?"}
{"text":"This place has the best hot dogs a little pricey, but you can get anything you can imagine on your hot dog. If your in the mood for hot dogs you should def check this place out."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of East Fremont bars, I'm a fan of Cheffini's Hot Dog Stand. It's definitely a way to curb the hunger whilst venturing between the Griffin, Beauty Bar and various other spots that we congregate at! If you get down to that area.. have a Cheffini dog :]"}
{"text":"Container Park on Fremont Street is a great place to hang out with the family or friends one afternoon. Cheffini's Hotdogs looked promising. They offer beef, turkey and vegan hotdogs with a great variety of toppings. The dogs and fries were very good.  The staff at the register was beyond rude. If you're that unhappy about your job or don't like working with the public, then go find another job."}
{"text":"Was anxious to check out Container Park since the last time I was in Vegas it wasn't built yet! Loved the concept of using containers and art to reclaim this land and to continue to make Fremont Street a more family friendly sort of place. At the early hour of 10:45 PM I was surprised to see the park already closing and that the only restaurant open was Cheffinis. Being that we were in the mood for casual though this hit the spot! A naked dog, grilled cheese and a Sam Adams were just what the doctor ordered.  During our visit there were four taps with only one of them working and the fryer was already turned off for the night which disappointed a lot of the people coming in wanting late night french fries - with that said though such a fun part of the downtown area and we were glad to have an opportunity to support this business."}
{"text":"Cheffinis hot dogs are similar to what you found outside of nightclubs in Mexico. There you will find them with cruched-up potato chips or ruffles con queso, beans, pico de gallo, crema, avocado, nacho cheese sauce, the works.  These are definitely a must-try before or after hitting the local downtown bars!"}
{"text":"Yummy hot dogs!! The sauce and chip toppings are so good, open late and even better 24/7?!?!  I would like a warmer dog and bun, but still tasted delicious! Inhaled it!"}
{"text":"Cheffinis little hot dog cart is just past the Fremont Street Experience in Downtown Las Vegas.   It is the perfect place for a late night rendezvous to stuff a hot weiner between your buns, get it all juiced up with extras, and then open your mouth wide and take as much as you can in to your oral orifice!   You may briefly have a gag reflex, but after you relax those throat muscles, the hot splash of flavors in your mouth after a  night of imbibing in adult beverages at the several nearby saloons is like an orgasm in your mouth.   You can ask for everything on it, and there is no extra charge, even for pineapples, to sweeten up the flavors gushing in your pie hole.   Just a $3 hand job in the mouth.   Hard to beat it!"}
{"text":"4.75 star! Outside of El Cortez, the hot dog stand is manned by a super friendly dude. Toppings galore. The pineapple sauce and potato chip toppings are their specialty toppings. Quality meat. A good quick rescue for a hungry late night tummy yearning.  They accept credit cards."}
{"text":"If my children finish it...it is great!!!!  Everyone loved coming here!!!! yummy!! and reasonably priced!!!"}
{"text":"Cheap deliciousness on the corner of Happy and Hungry! After the Commonwealth, the boyfriend and I crossed the street to the stand open nightly at 11PM for some street vendor food to sober us up.   These hot dogs are not the normal mustard, ketchup, relish kind of dogs. Instead, you get crushed chips and I love having chips in my sammy, so why not my hot dogs too! At only $3 a dog, it's a freaking steal for a Vegas budget. The sign tells you all the toppings the guy has and you can pick and choose what you want and don't want. I got everything but onions. Also, after seeing a fellow Yelper's photo, I asked to have my toppings under my hot dog. It works! Much less messier than had it been over the hot dog. You can also get a can of soda for $1.   Hidden gem of downtown Las Vegas, for sure."}
{"text":"Experience: Brought my nephews to play in the park and we decided to get hot dogs for dinner (they are super picky!!).   Facility:  VERY small spot inside container park. They do very well though, because they always have a line. Be prepared to wait to order and then wait again for your food to be cooked.  They do have a few seats inside  on the AC, but a lot more outside on the deck if you don't mind the heat in the day, but at night it's great outside. If you have kids, they have a giant unique playground in the container park that is free. Plus there are so many unique shops to visit afterwards.   Service:  yikes...my friend got the food while I saved the table so I'm not sure.   Food:  I liked the food. I had the fries with hot dogs on it and fry sauce aka Salcipapas. It was sooo good and the portion was huge!!!!!!! Not realizing how big it would be. I ordered some empanadas too. They were good, especially with the Green sauce!!!  The kids had hot dogs, fries and grilled cheese. Musta been decent, they ate it all.   Overall:  I would come back for sure. Good food, just terrible long wait."}
{"text":"I honestly can't talk this place up enough.  The first time I had the dogs, I'll admit - I was a little tipsy. Who isn't when you're hanging around Downtown that late at night? I may not have even tasted the hot dog the first time I had one, because I ate it so quickly. I was quick to declare this the \"Best Hot Dog in Town\" because honestly, everything tastes amazing when you're drunk, right?  It took a sober encounter with these \"dirty water dogs\" (just a nickname, don't let it throw you) before I could really, genuinely appreciate how good they are. My advice is to get them with everything on 'em; you'll really get the entire range of flavors and textures that way. These days, I really can't leave the stand with only one. At $3, they are definitely a steal.  There's only one downer I can think of; while Cheffini *does* accept credit/debit cards using the Square app on his phone, it'll cost you an extra dollar to pay that way. I get that it's a convenience--and I'm always willing to pay an extra dollar to a small business--but it's an unpleasant surprise if you're not ready for it."}
{"text":"He's always next to Vanguard/Insert Coins/Beauty Bar.  Great place for the guy to set up shop.  The same guy always works the cart.  And listen, I like a good dog down my throat like every other red blooded American male, but this place is different.  It's amazing.  Cheffini's Colombian self has saved my girlfriend's and my own stomach from total hangover city multiple times.  Their dogs are bomb, quick, convenient, and $3.  Yeah, I said it.  $3.  That's it, you cheap b@stards.  Seriously.  $3 for a jumbo dog with bacon, chips, ketschup, jalapenos, cheese, and mustard?  And I won't have a massive hangover tomorrow?  Sure.  Sign me up for two.  Hell, if I wasn't stuck at home right now, I'd go try and find this cat."}
{"text":"Cheffini's is located in Container Park toward the edge of the Fremont Street Experience. My boyfriend insisted we try this place after walking up & down Fremont Street. I'm so glad he did! The outside of Container Park is so cute & beautifully lit at night. I believe after certain hours, it is restricted to patrons 21 and over.   My boyfriend and I ordered the Crunchy Dog, The Grandfather, and salchipapas (fries, fried hot dog bits, and fry sauce). They were all delicious and very filling!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came on a Monday afternoon (the day after the Life is Beautiful Festival). This is such a cute little shop with only a few seats indoors. We ordered the following:  Moshi Moshi: $6.99 Grilled frank, carmelized onions, sea weed, jalapeño, wine sauce, spicy mayo, topped with sesame seeds  Cheffinis: $5.99 Grilled frank, onions, tomatoes, jalapeños, mozzarella cheese, potato chips, pineapple sauce, mustard, mayo and ketchup  Cheese fries: $7.99 French fries smothered in homemade cheddar cheese  Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Never underestimate the value of good drunk food. Even when not drunk, Cheffinis Hot Dogs are on point. The guy knows how to construct a delicious dog. Just go for \"everything on it\" and you'll be set. You can even ask for all the fixings to be put underneath the dog. Thanks to the guy ahead of me in line for ordering it that way; I followed suit. It seems like a less messy way to get all that mouth watering goodness into your, well, mouth."}
{"text":"YUM. YUM. YUM.  Best hotdog EVER. \"Thats what she said.\" LOL  I only have few words for this post...  El Mexicano and The grandfather...    DONE."}
{"text":"This used to be my to go place in downtown. Their sweet potato fries are a downtown hidden secret but this cinco de mayo made me not want to come ever again. First of the lady at the Register was really in a hurry to take my order and didn't let me take the time to ask for a couple of sides of ranch for my order of sliders. I waited nearly 40 mins just for three small sliders. Don't think it should've taken that long just for sliders. Won't waste my time here ever again."}
{"text":"Perhaps one of the best hot dogs I've ever had. I ordered one of their holiday specials: one Cheffini style hot dog with choice between a PBR or a soft drink for $7. The hot dog itself was amazing. The flavor was consistent throughout and the hot dog was cooked just right. The toppings that already come with it are great as well and adds to the aesthetic of the product."}
{"text":"This little hot dog cart is delicious!!! Propped across from Common Wealth!  Got a hot dog with everything expect for onions. It includes jalapeños and pineapple sauce! Who would've thought that would be good on a hot dog? I didn't. Now I'm a believer! Hahaha delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Venue is very small outside sitting to hit fir the heat. Prices are are reasonable food pretty good. My moshie moshiehit dog was different. I loved the sea weed and spicy kick to it"}
{"text":"The owner is a great dude and offers up an dog with toppings like pineapple and crushed potato chips. Freaking awesome!!!"}
{"text":"After an evening of happy hour libations, a friend and I decided to walk the streets of Fremont, in hopes of finding a place to eat at. After our first attempt at Le Thai and discovering they were closed, we turned around near The Beat and discovered this gem of a stand.   For $3, you get a Cheffinis dog and the opportunity to customize your dog from a list of 5 toppings and 5 dressings. For my visit, I got chopped tomatoes, chopped red onions, potato chips, ketchup and mayonnaise. Starting with the ketchup/mayo combo, it brought a sweet/salty and creamy element. The onions and tomatoes added that refreshing note to the dog but the chips were the kicker. The potato chips is definitely the star of the show. That salty-crunchy element brings the dog to life! You definitely must try it!  I heard the stand is available from Wednesday to Saturday, but I could be wrong. Hours of operation say it closes at 3:00am but it's actually once he runs out of dogs, so get there quickly. If you're looking to break up your evening full of drinks, or looking for a  post meal, check this place out. It's a small stand, yet not very hard to miss!"}
{"text":"Here's what great service means: came here to get their Grand Father Hot Dog. After paying and seating outside the lady working there came back to me and apologized for not having pork belly at the time (part of that hotdog). She asked if she could bring me some fries to compensate and asked me to come back later and she would give me on top of that ANOTHER Grand Father Hot Dog at no cost. After that she apologizes again. Wow!!! Hard to find service like this these days. Came back and to compensate even further they put the star pork belly on it!!! Will come back for sure. Loyal customer for life :)  BTW... Not only service their hot dogs are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I've never written a review for anything on yelp before but I'm a serious hotdog connoisseur and this is one of the best ones I've put in my chubby face. Get everything on it!"}
{"text":"I would've never known about this little hot dog cart if my friend never told me about it. After a night of drinking, we got hungry, and she suggested this little hot dog stand. And guess what? We went to it.   This little cart is located right in front of the Beat Coffee Shop, suite 520 on Fremont St. It turns out that the owner has been doing this for about 4 years now and even has his own brick n mortar in Container Park, which is located on 707 Fremont St. so don't get confused! This is the little cart on the street! He typically opens shop at around 11 pm I believe -- probably after the coffee shop is closed.   His hot dogs are $4 with a variety of toppings that include: mozzarella cheese, ketchup, mustard, jalapenos, potato chips, pineapple sauce, mayo, and tomatoes!  Let me tell you, the flavors and the different textures were really amazing! Or maybe it's because we were hungry after drinking and the alcohol makes it even more delicious? Who knows!   But definitely worth a try after drinking on Fremont St!"}
{"text":"Love this place we stop in every time we are in Container Park. Great prices and amazing toppings."}
{"text":"Pretty good! I'm not a vegan but I don't like the idea of hotdog meat so I got a vegan dog but kept the cheese etc.. I love that they have a meatless option. Probably the best veggie dog I've had in a long time. Service is ok too."}
{"text":"I am not a huge hot dog fan to be honest...but my parents were here visiting and wanted to stop  and have a quick bite somewhere...my mother was craving a hot dog.  So I yelped hot dogs and  Cheffinis came up. It had great ratings so I thought ...lets give it a try.  So glad we did!! They are in Container Park which I love. The service was great.  Hot dogs were yummy.  We each had the Naked dog with 2 completely different toppings.  I had  it with Mustard and cheese...dad...mustard and relish and mom cheese and bacon.  I ordered an order of cheese fries for us to share.  Homemade cheese sauce and shredded cheese...YUMMY.  Great cheese sauce.  It was perfect weather to sit outside and enjoy people watching.  Great experience....will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome Hot Dogs and Fries, if you like unique and different this definitely the place"}
{"text":"Have not had a hot dog yet but I love the chocolate coffee espresso milkshake!  Cool pretty chick works during day shift!  Super friendly!  Puts her heart into making U a nee drink to dip!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! And for downtown has reasonable prices. My husband, daughter and I came to the downtown container park for a children's event and we got hungry and decided to try this place. They did not disappoint, my daughter had the plain hot dog which she devoured. My husband and I both got the burgers and fries. Delish! They even give you \"fry sauce\" which is equivalent to the sauce and in and out, but spicier.  We also split a beer on top which was the perfect drink for a hot day. Def will be back. I did take off a star bc seating and space is pretty limited."}
{"text":"So you will have to bear with me on this one. I tried Cheffinis around 2am after having quite a few adult beverages ;). So my taste and my memory may have been a bit altered.   When I got up to the hotdog stand I had no idea they had all these different options! I just asked for one with everything, the guy working the stand was super fast and super nice considering he had to deal with theses tipsy girls asking him a bunch of silly questions. I have no idea what all was on my hotdog, I think some potato chips, the pineapple sauce and an array of different toppings. My taste buds were pleasantly surprised! I was not expecting all that. And as an extra bonus he took credit cards yay!!!  Ill definitely have to try this stand again when I am in a better state of mind, so I can really appreciate it."}
{"text":"Amazing hot dogs and toppings! Stumbled on this place and it was a great find. Tried the Cheffinis and El Mexicano, both were yummy! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Vegan friendly hotdogs! So.good, so fresh, so worth it. Plus the container park is way cute!!!"}
{"text":"You're downtown, you're probably drunk, you're definitely hungry, and the hot dogs have potato chips on them.   Seriously though, best hot dog around for $3."}
{"text":"I'm giving 1 star mainly because of service I was second in line and the cashier was very social and nice to the people ordering in front of me and then when I went up she said hold on and was gone for a good 5 minutes and than when she finally came back she's like what do u want and all I ordered was a kids mini cheffini hot dog for my son and no thank you or anything so I wait outside for my sons hotdog and it takes over 20 minutes so I finally go inside and immediately she just hands me the hotdog and that was it, again no thankyou have a nice day nothing and the hotdog was mediocre at best definitely not worth a 25 mini wait this place definitely needs to work on service and getting the food out quicker, especially since the service is terrible this place has got nothing going for them never again"}
{"text":"This place was really good. I don't eat red meat, so I was happy they had turkey hot dogs the food was on point and service was great."}
{"text":"It's the smallest hotdog I ever had   I was there at 11:00 pm, tried to order fries with my hotdog, the girl at the register told me that I can order hotdog only but not fries because they are closing  in  1 hr?!!!!!"}
{"text":"big fan.  BRILLIANT  business model--working 11pm-3am selling quality weiners to drunks.   like the $1 beverages.  $3 for such dogs is more than reasonable.   interesting tasty buns the like i've never had before.  good meat.  nice staff.   i went 2 nites in a row & got 2 dogs each visit & used the newspaper machine as a tabletop.   i wondered what the tasty crunchy topping was; potato chip bits !"}
