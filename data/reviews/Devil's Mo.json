{"text":"The best Mo in Tempe. The meat is really juicy and bread is crispy, and I also recommend the cold dry noodles there, which is freaking fresh and chewy with some secret chef signature sauce."}
{"text":"Tasty food, but space is limited so maybe not good for a group meals. Service is good, and price is reasonable. Overall, recommended."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese food in Arizona. The food incredibly authentic! Especially the Ja mo and beef roll, they are my favorite."}
{"text":"So sad this place closed had a great price point and amazing food hopefully something like this will open again. Always looking out for authentic Chinese food that's really good and well priced."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!!

I went to Phoenix on vacation and tried this place based on one of my local friend's recommendation. The Ja Mo (braised pork meat in a crispy flat bread bun) was absolutely delicious.  The meat was very flavourful, and the bread was crispy.  It was a symphony of flavours in my mouth.

I have had Ja Mo in numerous places in China, and this is on par with the best of them.  Very authentic food.

Big portions, delicious and low prices!Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I accidentally found this place on yelp today--it's a tiny store in a little strip with mostly business offices. The menu is small but sufficient for a simple meal. I ordered the Ja Mo and cold noodles combo and sat down in their small but clean dining area. The JaMo was hot, with crispy shell, and the meat was very flavorful. The cold noodles came with sliced beef, half an egg, and peanuts; the sauce was simple and I really liked it. 

A good place for a simple lunch or dinner. :)"}
{"text":"The food was great,on par with what I had from my hometown (the place where this dish originated).
The service on the other hand, I would rather go to a McDonald. The girl sitting in the front was playing on her phone the whole time, no hi, no thank you, no smile, no you're welcome after I thanked her. When she brought my food she basically slapped the food on the table in front of me.I get it that this is a quick in & out eat kind of place but basic decency in service still holds.
It's really a shame that a place with good food would get ruined by one unprofessional employee"}
{"text":"authentic Chinese food from west China. Specialist in pork! But do have a chicken dish and a beef pancake."}
{"text":"So if you're looking for some straight authentic Chinese food in Tempe, this is a great place to start. It's located in a place that almost looks like a business complex, but then you see the random exotic cars that the boujee Asian kids drive (you know this place is lit when they come here). 

Their special thing is a shredded pork bun called a Jang Mo. Its quite delicious and definitely worth a try. 

I personally really liked the beef noodles. They aren't hot, it's like a cold noodle mix, but amazing. I also like to add extra chili oil and vinegar which is provided on the tables. 

My friends really like the beef pancake roll and preferred that over the bun. 

Note on the combo. If you get the combo, the noodles come in a smaller size. Like half the size of the regular size. Not the biggest portion, but still enough if you're not super hungry. 

Yea, come and try this little gem in the wall"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this on a Saturday wanting to take a walk near Starbucks. We saw a food Car with Devil's Mo in a business complex and instantly our radar picked up... Good asian food? *Beep beep beep* yes!! What a nice find. 
We ordered the Jang mo. Is it moi or is it the jang mo?  I'm still confused from our experience what jang mo is. Is it a chinese burger or pancake?
 There was a language barrier when we asked the server. She just assured us it was authentic from China. We stuck with a safe choice the beef roll. It came out crispy  and had their own spin was spicy. 

I think they can work marketing their menu better because being asian myself I was still lost. Also, this place is fun to bring peope because it's in such a random plaza.

The chef even goes in the back that looks like an office. It's very TINY with small tables so a lot of people order to-go. Hope they expand and find a different space they have potential to be big here."}
{"text":"Super like the Chef's Special meal. Good comb. Delicious food. And they provide the special for the new stuffs which not on the menu. Ask them on the phone, or pay attention with their blackboard in store. There will be the surprise for you. Right now, as Mid-Auto Festival, they have the mooncake provide as the salt taste. Super love the mooncake."}
