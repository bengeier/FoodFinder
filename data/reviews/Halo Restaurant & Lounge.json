{"text":"Dinner was very good-Jon our waiter was very attentive-we aren't the easiest couple to accommodate. She's a pescatarian and I'm a celiac with a lactose intolerance!. We had the seafood casserole and the seafood lasagna, and will order these items again!"}
{"text":"My visit to Halo was in a large group for a wedding rehearsal dinner. It's a cozy restaurant, and was quite busy on the Friday we visited. The service was great. . . . when we received it. When we got there, our drink orders were taken quickly, but after that, we didn't see our servers for a half hour. Unfortunately someone in the group had to complain, and then we had a manager on top of our two servers helping at our table. It then took another hour to get our meals. I had a sirloin steak, on top of a green salad with crumbled blue cheese. It was very tasty, i had it medium rare and it was perfectly done, but I wish there was more blue cheese in the salad itself. I had a couple bites of friend's veggie lasagna, but I found it was bland and didn't have much variation in the veggies in it. For dessert I shared a cheese cake with Oreo crust and an apple pie with maple walnut I've cream and whip cream. Te desserts were huge! The apple pie was literally the size of my head. Minus the slightly undercooked bottom layer, it was delicious. Same goes for the cheesecake, really dense and rich, like cheesecake should be. All in all, I would say that Halo's food and service inconsistent. If they can work In that, this would be a top restaurant."}
{"text":"This place gives The Keg a run for its money. It's pricey, but if you have the Entertainment Guide (or three muhahaha) the prime rib at Halo is a great deal. The service is always great, the two patios are very cute, and the loaded potatoes come with all the fixings. It's no fine dining, but it sure beats making dinner. The fresh bread is a nice touch, and the cocktails are decent.  Cheers to not making dinner!"}
{"text":"Living in a suburb in south Calgary there aren't many really nice, higher end restaurants to choose from without driving a half hour to get downtown. So Halo is a gem for a drink and appi in the lounge/patio or for a nice meal on the main floor. The only reason I give it 4 star rather than 5 is because it can be pricy if you are not expecting it.  I love their Filet Mignon Au Gratin or for a less pricy meal their veggie lasagna. Make sure you try their double baked potato with a little sour cream, bacon and chives added!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went tonight and really hoped for great things. After a short read of the menu it seemed like it has an obvious Greek influence.  Room decorated dark but worked but had no different feel between the lounge and the restaurant.  We both ordered the French onion soup which was very good,  cheese plate was made with cheap cheese, kraft mini Brie wheels. Wife ordered the spaghetti and bison meatball that had a very strange taste that was not appealing, she ate half maybe.  I had a medium prime rib and mash potato,  prime rib was well done and bland, mash potato was smooth but flavourless, the beaver horseradish which is know as hot was sour and bitter, sautéed red cabbage and a half piece of bok choy to finish off.  I ate maybe a third of my plate. Happy the manager came over and apologized and paid for our 2 drinks but would of expected the meals taken care of since they were hardly eaten. 

Is there anything good in the SE, we are really trying to find a great spot with little luck."}
{"text":"In regards to Sarah B's comment, I agree that there is hardly anyone else there when we go there to eat, which I find strange considering it is a fantastic place to have a meal and a few drinks. I am contributing as to why they always seem so slow to the fact that they are in an obsolete location. 

All I can tell you from personal experience, is that the quality of their meals is well above reproach. We consider it one of our favorite places to eat, which is Ironic because it is on the other side of the city from us. 

I highly suggest eating on the outdoor patio in the summer, as we had an unbelievably fantastic time with our group of 4. I ordered the High Roller and a couple of Caesars, and I couldn't have been more pleased. We had extraordinary service, little wait time, and the servers were very knowledgable about the drinks, especially the beer and wine selections, and were sure to check on us at just the right times. We have been there many times, and have NEVER had a bad experience.

Long story short, don't let appearances fool you, check this place out, and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Twenty one of us celebrated a birthday at Halo on Saturday evening. We appreciated the atmosphere in the separate area they reserved for us and the fact we could move between our tables to visit with other members of our group. Our server, Marvin was very patient, friendly, attentive and more than willing to accommodate all of our requests. Well done, Marvin!
We were impressed that our meals were all served hot and at at relatively the same time. Our entrees were great, and some in our group even had room for the Halo's home made desserts, which were enjoyed too.
Thanks for a great evening, Halo!"}
{"text":"My spouse and I had a double date with his twin brother here. We had the filet mignon with blue cheese and it was honestly the best price of meat I've had in a long time! So delicious and perfectly cooked too. The appies we had were excellent as well. We all left with full bellies and were all very happy with the meals and service. Great little atmosphere as well. If you can, as for a reso in the special date night room. It was a little extra decorated and off to the side, added a nice little ambiance to an already great meal. We will definitely be back! Pricy but worth it for a great night out."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for a couple of years now. It's a great little spot and serves the best Filet Au Gratin in the city (personal opinion, but I do eat a lot of steak). My only turn off is that their overpriced for what you get but that being said, they have a nice, warm atmosphere and the staff are extraordinarily friendly! I wouldn't recommend the seafood. We had lobster once and it was over cooked even after a couple of attempts of re-doing it. So meh on that level. However they do have some really great appy's: Stuffed cap mushrooms and saganaki are our favourite."}
{"text":"I kept seeing Halo pop up on my yelp for wine bars in my area, so I thought it was about time we check this place out!

We decided to sit in the lounge and get a few tapa's and sips. I really like the feel of the restaurant it was cozy but fancy - also the music that was playing lightly in the background was awesome!
Our server was very nice and accommodating, always coming around at the right time. Good service always makes the experience better in my books.

We decided to get to the mini yorkshires, the cheese platter, stuffed mushrooms and the bacon wrapped shrimp. I didn't really like the yorkshires, I found that they had a lot of dough vs beef ratio but they certainly do give you a lot of them. The cheese platter was good but only came with 6 crostini's so we had to ask for more. The stuffed mushrooms I found had an overkill amount of cheese on them, but were ok.  Lastly, you cannot go wrong with bacon wrapped shrimp. Yum!

Although I found a few items that we ordered to be lacking I really enjoyed the atmosphere and will be heading back in the near future for some more.

{"text":"When my boyfriend and I came in, it was busy. Halo staff got us a table right away.  They had terrific service and great food. We didn't get a waiter. However 4 of the staff were very accommodating. They worked as a team."}
{"text":"Here for lunch today. Was pretty good. Service was ok, no complaints. Beef dip was good, but gravy was a little too salty. I'd come back again to try some other items."}
{"text":"Seriously my favourite restaurant in Calgary. We have eaten here about 7 times and it is always top notch. One night we were in a little late and had a waitress that was very very good. She did not tell us but we found out later that she was actually the owner. We were talking off hand to her about how much we like the place and wig the bill she added a $50 gift card. By then she was gone, obviously did not want to make a fuss.  Now to the food, unreal. We had and will always have bacon wrapped prawns and/ or baby yorkies to start. I could eat just those! Then you get the steak, or fish or pretty much anything and it will always exceed expectations. Thanks Halo, you rule!"}
{"text":"Halo Restaurant is a pretty popular place. They have a very romantic setting that really sets the mood. If anyone is looking for a place to go on a date, this would be it.. There is a ton of room in this place. The dining area is wonderfully lit and the colours are a mix of reds and blacks, very gothic romantic. 

The food is delicious as well. I had the calamari for an appie and it was perfectly crispy and delicious. I could eat it again and again. For my main I had the bruschetta chicken. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the bruschetta was cold. It was really fresh and usually a mix of hot and cold could work but not in this case. It cooled the chicken down way too fast, and it wasn't super hot to begin with. I had the garlic mashed potatoes as a side and they were not that great. I was expecting whippy and light but it didn't turn out like that. They were mashed but a little lumpy, however still delicious. i could taste the garlic, but barely. 

For dessert i had the apple pie that's individually baked and it was pretty delicious. My only complaint would be the fact that the pastry wasn't flaky enough. It was a little tough.

One of us had the lamb and it was absolutely gorgeous. It was cooked to perfection and served at a great tempurature. A few of us also had the prime rib which was again, perfect. The serving was huge thought so make sure you have an appetite. 

On the other hand our service was absolutely fantastic. Our waitress knew everything that she needed to know. She wasn't all over us and she paid attention. She was great!

For anyone who wants good food and a great atmosphere, Halo is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Halo hasn't failed me yet, for a slightly high end dining experience far from downtown, Halo is great choice. Our brunch experience here was satisfying. My mom's eggs Benedict was seasoned right and my steak and eggs was very satisfying and set me straight for my Sunday.

Our server, Marvin was friendly and jovial. He went out of his way for us several times and made the effort to look into our first world requests like getting the veggies steamed, my moms water into adequate room temperature (not joking there), and getting the dozen condiments I asked for, individually . Not sure what was up with mother and son that day but we were restless, haha

Their brunch prices were fair and again for food that you can get inner city, halo is just as good.

Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 16/30"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this location back when it was the Bull & Finch and have been keen to try out Halo over the past few years. The menu (http://www.halorestaurant.com/index.php?page=menu) looked enticing, if a bit pricey, but I was looking forward to it.

I'd highly recommend booking a reservation, particularly on the weekend, as the restaurant was all but full when I arrived at 6:30. The decor is warm and inviting, giving it the kind of atmosphere one would enjoy spending some time sitting by the fire sipping a glass of Riesling on a fall evening. As a result, a friend and I decided to celebrate my birthday with a glass of wine and good food.

Sadly, the menu that had tempted us fell a bit flat. On paper it was excellent, and while the food was very good, it was no better than what you might find more reasonably-priced at Earls or Moxies.

We started with the Oysters - which were West Coast and, I'm given to understand by my Maritime friend, not as good as East Coast - which were well-priced and rather flavorful. We also ordered the saganaki (Greek-style flaming cheese), a favorite of ours that we were surprised to find on the menu. It was delicious.

Touted as a \"Steak, Seafood and Wine Bar\", I decided to celebrate my birthday with the sirloin steak and arctic crab legs. While tasty, the crab was a bit dry, and I was surprised to find it wasn't quite as good as arctic crab I'd had at Joey's Only just a few weeks before. The steak was cooked to my instruction but hardly seasoned, and my side order of sautéed mushrooms and caramelized onions amounted to $10 of less-than-exciting flavor. The

We finished with the chocolate mousse - served in a wine glass - which was done perfectly, and each enjoyed a glass of White Zinfandel which, at $8/glass, was priced well, based on other places I've been. The gist of the evening was average food for above-average prices. However, because the atmosphere was lovely, and the service was excellent - attentive, frequent and friendly - I would return in the summer months to share an appetizer and glass of wine on the beautiful upstairs patio."}
{"text":"I used to go to a business club and ate lunch here every week for about 25-30 weeks of the year from 08-10. It used to be one of my favorite places then in 2009 suddenly something weird happened: The portions decreased by 1/3 and the prices went up by 20%. Ever since then I have stopped going there frequently and now only go there about once a month. 

The food is quite good, service decent, and the atmosphere nice but when the bill comes it is kind of a shock and not a great value in my opinion.

So what I will suggest is this: Go there for the specials!

Currently on Tuesday's they have Baby Yorke's for $1 each and this is quite a deal. Halo probably has some of the best Yorke's in the city - they are so fresh and the meat is tender; they melt in your mouth. Yum.... I can't wait till next Tuesday!

Monday's is a prime rib special $15 or $16 I believe, and you would have to look at the website for other details.

Another thing is don't forget dessert. Their dessert is amazing! This evening I went for Yorke night and was really mad; they didn't give me the fireside table I reserved (and there was all of 4 tables - it was slow) and then after ordering 10 Yorke's they ran out for the night. I was all about to axe them off my list forever and storm off when I decided I would buy dessert. Well dessert was impressive. I ordered the New York Cheesecake with Strawberry's and it was great. Very fresh, homemade (not frozen like most Calgary places!) and a good portion and price. It had a Oreo crust which was much nicer than the traditional graham cracker and hit the spot nicely and is now the reason I am going back. In fact I think it was better than the cheesecake I have ordered at The Cheesecake Cafe!

After talking with the waitress I learned that all the deserts are homemade like the Baily's Creme Berle, Baklava, Apple puffed pastry with granola and maple walnut ice creme, and a bunch of others I intend the try.

Also had tea with dessert and again I was impressed - not your typical Red Rose but instead a loose leaf tea called (Reveal?) it came in a little box and was presented nicer than any tea I have ordered at a lounge before.

So in summary: come here and eat the specials, good desserts!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  I have been here for a first date, a celebration dinner and few other times. Each time the food was exceptional and service was incredible.  great wine selection. perfection. food was cooked perfectly steaks seasoned great flavourful dishes bravo."}
{"text":"My partner and I went here for our fifth year wedding anniversary this year. He booked the reservation and we were in for a pesecetarian paradise. We started off with a drink I can only describe as the carribbean in a glass, and each had crab legs for dinner. We opted for the Atlantic King Crab which was outstanding. It was moist, rich, and extremely tantalizing.

He also had a steak, but I was content to eat many many crab legs. We had a great time, and our only complaint was that we sat next to the fireplace, and even when it was turned off it was a touch too warm (i.e. the rocks of the fireplace held the heat for a very long time).

Normally for our anniversary we'd opt for dessert, but because I ate so many crab legs, we skipped it and called it a night. A very delicious meal in a great ambience."}
{"text":"Have driven past this place for years, and finally went the other night. Fabulous. Fabulous service, great food and great waitress."}
{"text":"I went here last night for a family dinner, and as always, I was impressed with the upscale feel and look of the restaurant. The server was friendly and diligent in coming around to the table to see if we needed anything. He was a little over attentive, and eager to please, which got a little annoying. 
I got the maple glazed cedar plank salmon with garlic mashed potatoes; I was blown away with how juicy and flavourful the salmon was! It was truly a sinfully delicious meal! The meal also came with roasted carrots and summer squash, which were not amazing, but the salmon made up for them.

Thank you Halo, for a wonderful dinner and atmosphere yet again!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. I have been numerous times and never been disappointed.. Gotta try the stuffed mushrooms. They are the best.  
The wine selection is good and the steak is amazing. 

The patios are perfect for a nice quiet dinner.
This is by far my favourite restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to Halo Restaurant last night and we enjoyed a wonderful dinner and service upstairs in their dining room.
It was nice having dinner with the black table linens and red napkins and we enjoyed the hot crusty bread with whipped butter served prior to our meal.  Our server was a very wonderful lady who I forget her name but she had short brown hair and very attentive to ensure our evening was enjoyable.  Service was prompt and excellent!

My husband had the 10 oz Prime Rib and I had the Tuscan SeafoodPasta dish with the salmon and large prawns.  He asked for med rare prime rib and it was soooo delicious and tender.  I kept sneaking pieces of his meat for myself.  He also loved the lemon garlic potatoes with his meals and the fresh snow peas as well.
My seafood pasta dinner was so tasty and my husband got to enjoy several large prawns from my dinner.  

After dinner we shared the Mocha Kahlua Ice Cream Pie and thank goodness we shared it together.  It was 4 large triangles of Layered vanilla icecream, homemade chocolate kahlua cake, fudge & cookie crumbs.  It was sooooo good and quite a large serving.  
I will have to come back and try the other desserts here.  Most restaurants often serve factory made desserts but Halo makes their own and are very delicious !

I am glad I came here and we had a very lovely evening dinner date and I wouldn't go by any negative reviews of Halo.  We feel that the food was great, the service was great and we will definitely come back here again and bring our family.  We saw the manager at  the front of the entrance and made sure we told him how pleased we were."}
{"text":"This is kind of a lame review, as I didn't have any food, but I notice no one else has reviewed, so I figured I'd at least give you the general what's-what.

No one working there knew what a snakebite was. I think they thought it was the same as a sidecar. I don't know if that really gives me confidence in the place. I mean, I know bartending probably isn't a career for the guy behind the bar, but take a little pride in your work!

Other than that, it was completely empty. We were the only people there. I can't imagine this is a good sign. 

If you're in the area, I'd say it's worth stopping in, not too much around the Bonavista/Avenida/McLeod area, but you know...don't expect magic."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for a date night sans the kids and enjoyed ourselves immensely. I had booked a reservation the day prior and asked for a quiet spot. We were placed next to a fireplace and it was quite a romantic setting. We started out the meal with some drinks and the seafood stuffed mushroom caps which were divine (and I don't particularly care for mushrooms). Highly recommended!

I had the \"Halo's Highroller\" - ribeye and king crab - and it was very tasty. The steak was cooked to perfection. The crab was very tasty although the shells were a bit rubbery making them hard to break. The sides were tasty and I'd highly recommend the stuffed potato option. 

My wife had a Tuscan pasta of some sort with shrimp, etc. she enjoyed it, but I'm not sure she would order it again. Not because anything was wrong, but it just wasn't something she would typically have."}
