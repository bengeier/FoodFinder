{"text":"Delicious home cooked food. Soups and pierogies are delicious. You can't go wrong. Don't count on superb decor. It's basically the hole in the wall you want to go for a yummy, authentic, hot, and very reasonably priced Polish meal! Feels like home."}
{"text":"It's truly a hidden gem! Good quality for good price. The food is delicious and authentic (I am Polish so I know what I'm talking about). Don't judge this place for the decor and furnishings- the food is really great!"}
{"text":"Ordered this food through UberEATS.  I chose the cabbage rolls and borscht.     Best food I've ever had delivered to me ever"}
{"text":"As far as Polish food goes, this place is as legit as they come. You've got almost every stereotypical Eastern European option done right. We're talking tasty schnitzel, moist, tangy cabbage rolls, plump pirogies with fried onions, quite a few soup options, pork hock and pungent sour kraut. I don't work out this way anymore, but sometimes I still make the drive! The best part is it's a balance between restaurant, hot table and frozen food distributor for all your Polish cuisine needs."}
