{"text":"Hi, 
so i went there last week. I was running some errands in the area and i thought i didn't want to cook and i was hoping to find some nice Paki/Indian restaurant for take out as i wasn't feeling in the mood to cook something back home. I went around in the evening at 6PM the restaurant was completely empty. It was Thursday. I ordered Chicken biryani with bone and chicken karahi with bone. The server took the order said it will be 15 mins. So the food came out in the aforementioned time was packed nicely in a brown bag with my bill and all. I went home and took out my food and then i was like what is this. I mean seriously u guys are giving me just bones nothing else literally there was no flesh to be seen like u know not even bite size like it was tiny winy fleshy there stuck to the bone and not only with biryani with the karahi too i mean everything was gravy and nothing else. I am never going back there ever again. Before entering there i was thinking to try Pak Halal which is just across the street from them but i just decided to go there and now i'm writing this review. So if u like bones and not meat in your order be my guest and go there otherwise....."}
{"text":"The authentic aroma of Indian cuisine welcoming to the senses. Atmosphere is calming and clean. Food was exceptionally well prepared. My daughter Lila enjoyed ever dish we got and I was very happy with the meal."}
{"text":"We came here with guest from. Abroad 

Had alot of food ... bihari kabob was nice snd spicy , the fish was ok not the greatest , lollipop chicken was good and not spicy .... kids loved that ... 
Kabob was nice too... the turn off was our last dessert which was called Rabri. .. Rabri didn't taste good.  It tasted like banana pudding  . 
We told the waitress and he said that's jow we make our rabri ... Yuk ... I ordered to taste real rabri.. nit banana rubber . Eww... other than that .. food was good   ."}
{"text":"Good consistent food and great customer service! Lollipop Chicken, tawa chicken, bihari kabob, chicken chilli tikka are a must! They have really good freshmade naans.  Weekend buffets are also a must try."}
{"text":"Ordered the dinner for 4 persons.  Service was good (we were the only customers eating in on a weekday evening) while others came in for take-out.  Kebabs flavourful and portions were average."}
{"text":"I'll give it a 4 star only because the chilli chicken tikka are THE BOMB! 
I didn't love the butter chicken nor the dal, but the tikka made up for both. Next time I go, I think I'll just order off of their tandoori menu."}
{"text":"The food was alright and the service was good but the place was dirty.
There was one waitress that was good but everyone one else was ignorant. 
The bathrooms were disgusting, out of toilet paper and the tables were greasy, on top of that the cups were placed upside down making the mouth piece touching the greasy table."}
{"text":"Best Bangladeshi authentic food such as Vorta, plain dal , rice , beef curry and many more.  went for Sunday buffet... it was great . not going to Indian buffet restaurants any more ... this location is also great for kebabs and grill ... next time for sure"}
{"text":"Nice food presentation. Restaurant needs proper heating system it was very cold. Nice friendly staff. Food prices are reasanable does not taste the best.."}
