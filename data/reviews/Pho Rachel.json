{"text":"I love this pho place. I walked past and decided to try it. The beef pho is really delicious and filling too!! If you like spice, they also have strong but tasty spicy sauce. Also, the owner of this place is really sweet and welcoming. I want to come back again when I visit Montreal again next time."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating at Pho Rachel multiple times since July of this year. Their beef pho is delicious, one of my favorites in Montreal. Their spring and imperial rolls are super yummy too. I also love their grilled meat dishes.

Pretty busy spot during weekday lunch, otherwise quiet. Very casual restaurant, one of the only authentic Vietnamese restaurants in the Plateau.

{"text":"Great soup and fast service :(
Nice place, not too noisy.
Take a medium size soup, it's already sufficient as a meal :)"}
{"text":"Delicious pho!!! I had the grilled chicken and vegetable soup- tasty lean grilled chicken without a bit of fat on it, flavourful broth, lots of crispy veggies. They also have vegetarian pho with vegetable broth, veggies and tofu, which my husband tells me is great. Imperial rolls were crispy and good. Small place, on the expensive side for pho but totally worth it. So few places in the Plateau that do pho and this is the only good one! I got take-out and it came in a nice big container you can use as a soup bowl. I will be going back a lot this winter!"}
{"text":"The comforting feel of mom's cooking... if my mom could cook Vietnamese. I came here one night because it was the only viet place close to me that was open late. Also, it's relatively cheap. Now, I go each time I visit Montreal. 

The portions are huge, there's a vegetarian option, and the appetizers are amazing. Writing this is making me want their peanut sauce. Right now. 

They have friendly staff too! 

Highly recommended for simple, cheap, quick eats."}
{"text":"Very tasty, fast service - had the grilled chicken with rice noodles. Since I work nearby the fast service is a huge plus. Will be coming back."}
