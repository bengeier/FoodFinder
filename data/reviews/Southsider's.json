{"text":"Family owned, ran and loved! I have been going for yrs and I always enjoy my food"}
{"text":"Great food, and wonderful people. And one of the owners dresses as santa clause. Oh and this place is kid friendly, which is a huge bonus for us."}
{"text":"Southsiders is expanding! Yeah! AND they are having live rock and roll bands starting in September, OMG! Right in down town Waxhaw. Now we over 40 generation have somewhere to \"hang\", like in the old days. A place that is casual, good food, good brews and now dance music, I'm gonna die."}
{"text":"Me and my husband used to go here at least once a week. But when they changed their menu and increased prices, we stopped. I don't think the new menu is very good and cost way too much. We recently went to an upscale restaurant and paid about the same as we did at Southsiders. So unless the menu and prices go back to the way it was, we won't be back."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst service I've ever received at a restaurant.  It took almost five minutes, after being seated, to be given menus.  I order water for myself, my husband and my two year old daughter.  Now I understand that this isn't necessarily a \"kid restaurant\" but the place was crawling with children, so I was VERY surprised when our waitress brought out a pint glass of water for my daughter.  I spent the rest of the time trying to help her with the glass.  Since we rarely saw our waitress, there wasn't a chance to ask for a different cup.  After sitting there for over half an hour, the waitress came out to inform my husband that they were out of part of his meal.  She offered to substitute it for something else but gave no suggestions for substitutions.  We found this weird since we had placed our order quite a bit before this and they were just getting to our order?  After FORTY-FIVE minutes, and my daughter asking and apparently being overhead by other waitresses that she was hungry, we received our food.  No apologies for the delay or anything, just simply handed our food.   When we were given our ticket, my husband noticed that the time stamp for when the order was placed was less than fifteen minutes prior to it being brought out, meaning our waitress didn't put the order in until we had been sitting there for over half an hour.  
I would definitely NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was simply AMAZING!! I had the Spinach wrap with grill chicken cranberries, pecans, lettuce feta cheese and a humus spread on the wrap!! It cam with the fantastic Crunch slaw!! A+ My friend had the Grill Cuban Panini with the Crunch slaw!! Best we have ever had!!  My friend has been coming to eat at this place for SEVEN years now and they have expanded since her last visit. You won't be disappointed with the food! Simply wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"We have just moved to Waxhaw and stopped in for a bite to eat on a Thursday evening.  They were out of shrimp entrees (which is what my husband wanted) and his beer (Blue Moon) was warm, although in a cold glass. He ended up with a Philly cheese steak and said it was okay. 

I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with fries. I thought it was really good, although a toasted bun would have made it even better. 

I wasn't impressed with the menu and thought it seemed a little limited but the food was decent."}
{"text":"Food was horrible.  We had a Philly Cheese steak and the meat was over cooked and chewy.  The shepherds pie seemed like a can of Campbell's soup over chewy meat mixed with frozen peas and carrots topped with mashed potato.  Gross.  Never been charged for a refill on club soda before this place!  
We were the only people in the place and it took 10 minutes for a drink refill.  They were also out of their steak dish, which was our first choice, so we opted for the Philly.  The roll was good and the fries were good.  Other than whatnot much was good at all!"}
{"text":"I been coming to Southsiders since they opened. The food is good ( love the prime rib special) but what's really awesome is the music. Its the best kept secret in the Charlotte area. Wen night open mike blue grass is awesome, then bands on Fridays. You don't have to go Charlotte to have a great night out and hear awesome bands, just go to Southsiders. Great food, full bar, killer music in the best little town in NC. Yes, its true I love my town!"}
{"text":"Food here is good. The beer selection is alright. They have live music on the weekends. I like this place a lot, it has a cool atmosphere. The Irish nachos are so good."}
{"text":"Southsider's has been a great restaurant that my family has visited since they opened! The owner is kind and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. It's got quality food, a really good beer variety and they very well be the nicest people you'll ever meet. The two owners are always walking around asking how things are. They really care and they get it too.  Cant think of a better place to go when you aren't looking for something fancy.  The only negative is it isn't closer to my house, but that doesn't stop us from going. It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"We ate there on Sat. 3/23/13, and the food and service was great.  It has been a while since I was last there so I was surprised to see that they have expanded.  We were there for a very early dinner, and it appears to be a great place to hang out since they now have open mic. on Thurs and live music on Fri/Sat.  
They do have a different menu for dinner, however, they have always been gracious in serving me my favorite: the Chicago Dog!  It's only on the lunch menu, and each time that I've requested it, there has never been a problem getting it.  They have the absolute best Chicago Dog around - as they should - since the owners are from Chicago!  :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice, but this time was horrible.  I can count  on one hand how many times I have sent food back in my entire life, but I just had to this time. 

Just as I did during my first visit, I ordered the Shepherd's Pie, but this time it was inedible!  Almost EVERY piece of \"beef\" was filled with gristle.  It is horrible to sit across from some one and HAVE to spit out piece after piece of gristle filled meat.  The topping of mash potatoes was heavy with salt and the slurry of beef heavy with pepper, but the seasonings are a matter of taste. Unchewable meat is not!

After trying to eat about 1/4 of the dish I gave up since the waitress had finally reappeared. I told her the dish was INEDIBLE!  She was very receptive and asked me what else I would like.  Since I had been looking over the menu while I was waiting for the waitress to reappear and had found nothing.  I figured that I had started with a small dinner salad so I would end with the same.  I felt terrible sending food back especially since I had enjoyed that same dish during my first visit and mentioned that to the waitress who said \"they\" were looking into what had happened.

Unfortunately I had to leave before my dining partners so I made a point to state that I had only consumed two small dinner salads and some tea.  I never thought a restaurant would charge for a meal that had been sent back with a plate filled with spat out meat which had obviously been chewed, but to my shock and surprise they did!  They had the nerve to add my sent back meal to the bill.  My dining partners were too quiet to make a fuss and paid MY bill!  I feel terrible leaving them with my problem.  NEEDLESS TO SAY I WILL NEVER BE BACK THERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"I walked in here after finishing a long cycling ride. The refrigerator by the counter was stocked with a nice selection of beers, sports drinks, fruit juices, and even chocolate milk (a great recovery drink). We glanced at the menu but our attentions had already been captured by the description of a Chicken Pesto Panini on the specials white board to the left of the register.

We sat down in the small but comfortable eating area. It's decorated with various mementos of the owners & their employees but there is a side table stocked with dominoes, puzzles, chess pieces, and books inviting one to stay awhile. 

Then the owner brought our food out and the sandwiches were very well made. Hot and freshly grilled the melted provolone melded well with the pesto and red peppers.  But the most surprising taste was the side dish of \"crunchy slaw\" a mixture of cabbage, a very mild apple vinegar, sunflower seeds, and ramen noodles. To say it was delicious is to put it mildly. 

With a relaxed atmosphere, friendly owners, great food and a variety of beverages it'll be the place I stop in when I need a bite to eat in the historic downtown."}
{"text":"Historic Waxhaw's First \"Public\" House serving Guinness & Blue Moon on tap along with many other craft beers, and delicious Boar's Head Brand Deli Sandwiches on Fine Breads. Doesn't get better than this!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the mood for a sandwich and a beer in the Waxhaw area, this is my go-to spot. The staff are very sweet and accommodating, and their food is excellent. I will admit that if I go to order a hot-dog, the order turns into two. Super delicious. 

The outside patio is cozy, and inside is pretty relaxing too. This is an enjoyable spot to hang out with friends or have a quiet lunch to yourself. Make sure to look for it if you are visiting downtown Waxhaw; just before you cross over the railroad tracks at the end of 16, hang a left and park in front of the tracks. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"I have been to Southsuders a few times, and enjoy the different beers they serve. The last time I went with some friends. We all ordered beers and apps. I had the grilled shrimp and my girlfriend ordered a shrim cocktail.  I was very dissapointed in the portions, the shrimp cocktail had five nice sized shrimp, while mine had three. I asked why the differance, but yet the same price, and the waitress was told by the cook that he had run out of shrimp. I thought that would have been some useful information before serving it.

  I will go again, but only for beer. NO food."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times and we keep hoping that the painfully slow service was just a fluke, but I don't think it is at this point.  It's really too bad, this is a local place, good food and drink menu, and live entertainment.  The promise of something good is there, but don't go there if you are starving because it takes over 30 minutes for food to be delivered to the table.  

I overheard two of the waitresses say that the bartender had to run out to the store so that they had to make our drinks in his absence (since it was taking SO LONG for him to get back).  15 minutes later, our drinks finally arrived.  I ordered the same drink that I ordered the last time I was there and it was nothing like I had before.  Not terrible, but not the same either and in a completely different sized glass than last time, too.  My Mom's drink was so strong that she couldn't drink it until it was watered down by the ice.  So, I have to take a star off for the poured drinks being inconsistent in taste and size.  

Our last visit was at 7:30 on a Saturday night.  It was me, my husband, my 15 yo son, and my Mom.  My husband ordered the steak sandwich (as he did the last time, too..he liked it), my son ordered the Big Mick Burger (Southsiders take on the Big Mac...he liked it very much) and my Mom and I both had the Fish & Chips...and they were truly excellent!!!  Nice mild tender fish, crispy fluffy batter that wasn't greasy, and it was piping hot with delicious french fries.  My only complaint about the food isn't even about the food...it's about the wait for the food.  We didn't get our food until after 8:15!

We finished eating at 8:45, but then had to wait for the waitress to clear our table and bring us the check.  We didn't leave until after 9:00.  90 minutes for a burger, steak sandwich, and fish & chips is a bit much!

Will we go back for a third time?...I'm on the fence at this point.  I'm also skeptical to recommend this place to my large circle of local friends because of the slow service.  Even though we are all hoping for a great local place to gather at!  I hope that they can get their timing right in the kitchen and make sure everyone is following the same drink menu.  This could be a great local go-to, but it's not there just yet."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch passing through from Charlotte. The food was good, just not a whole lot to choose from on the meu. My chicken quesadilla was very tasty, and I loved the cheese in it. The tomatoes were not ripe enough for my taste (see photo), and I needed extra sour cream. I would order it again. The wait staff was nice and attentive. 

There is not a lot of parking. The decor was...blah with a mix match of tables and chairs only. The stage is right in the front by the window used for bands at night. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason for the seating. When we walked in we didn't know which was to go until we were told to choose a seat. Give it a try as the food is good.

Oh and they do not sell hotdogs anymore as other yelpers suggest."}
{"text":"Mark, I see your comment above about the bottled drinks but please listen to your customers and get a fountain machine. I understand the recycling part and if you are worried about landfills was glasses, coke will provide them!"}
