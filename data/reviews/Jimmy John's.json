{"text":"Best sandwiches I've had in a long time! And they'll deliver--if you fall in their small delivery zone-- 1 sandwich to you. This comes in handy for me while I'm at work and hungry!   I love the bread & their mayo. YUM! I usually order the beach club. No complaints from me!"}
{"text":"Charges for delivery unlike any other jimmy Johns. Chips were expired. Stay away from this one."}
{"text":"Came here around lunch time. I ordered ahead online to avoid the line. As soon as I walked through the door I was greeted by several of the workers. Somehow they already knew what order I was there to pick up. Oh and the sub hit the spot. As always."}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy eating here until I found out what one of my friends said about this place. He was a former employee of this Jimmy Johns on Power Road and told me about all of the comments that are made behind the counter. Who would've known such a fine establishment could be filled with so much cynicism and racism towards employees. Basically authority will take the nicest employees and then find reasons to take them down verbally with repeated vile comments day in and day out. Nothing like sandwiches made by discriminatory top-level management what taste better than a prejudice filled sandwich I thought sandwiches were made with passion at this place."}
{"text":"Worse service when you go inside.  We ordered  our food to go.  You would think that meant putting our food in a bag.  Nope.  We had to ask the lazy chick for the bag & bag it ourselves.  No one was in the place!!"}
{"text":"Always nice to come here for lunch. The sandwiches are of course made super fast and the staff is uniformly friendly."}
{"text":"I love jimmy j's.  I eat at the desert ridge location every week, and have always been satisfied with the service.  I not sure what everyone else is complaining about.   My favorite is the vegetarian #6.  Lastly, I highly recommend the delivery option.  The drivers are usually fast and very personable."}
{"text":"I got Jimmy johns all the time and for a while it was great; I hadn't a problem with them. But lately, they've gone downhill. Not only did they mess up my order completely twice in a row, but the delivery people wanna give you an attitude if you don't tip them well enough. It was an hour before they arrived at my door. \"Freaky Fast\" is a big lie. If you want a quality sub, go to Jersey Mikes."}
{"text":"Just ate in at this location, my first time there.  Not bad, fairly tasty but nothing amazing.  I would say it's a little better than your average Subway.  The bread is very good.  Prices are affordable too.  I will probably go back again some day.  Oh, and yes, they really are fast, by the time I paid, my sandwich was already done."}
{"text":"I love jimmy johns and was really excited when this location opened up, only to find out it didn't deliver to us (2 miles away :(....boo!) That wasn't really a big deal, the problem I have is that every time I go in there are only kids working and the music is blasting like I'm about to go to the club on a fri/sat night. I wasn't greeted.....all 3 employees just looked at me and stared blankly. Customer service is a huge priority in my books as I've worked in this industry my whole life. Food is usually pretty good, especially at the Fort Mill location but both Italian nightclubs we got were drenched in oil & vinegar....neither my bf or I could finish them. Will continue to drive to the Ft. Mill location where their service is always on point!"}
{"text":"Subway has bigger and better tasting sandwiches. For the price I expected something delicious, but it was pretty meh."}
{"text":"I've been to the jimmy Johns in IL. ...this is nothing like it.....Super slow!!  And then they screwed up our sandwiches   ...forgot the bacon!  If you want service from young stupid, slow kids this is your place."}
{"text":"we ordered 3 sandwiches and we asked for the dressing on the side and they said they could not do that. they were not allowed to have dixie cups so they had to put it in a cup."}
{"text":"I order from here at least once a week because it's close to my office and they deliver.  These guys are fast and the food is great.  Never had a problem and the online ordering makes life super easy!!"}
{"text":"As of this writing, this Jimmy John's location is 3 weeks old.  I was shocked to see it as I whisked by. (Shocked in a good way, cuz the Subway shop across the street by Bashas is sub par for Subway.)  It's a bustling, slightly crowded, landlocked strip mall on the NE side of Power and McDowell, right before you head North for tubing or before you head East to do some cycling or catch the 202 South. It's pretty much adjacent to the Las Sendas neighborhood.  I went at 12:30pm on a Thursday and, as I ordered a Turkey Tom with cheese and sprouts, the kids got busy making it. By the time I paid (2 min later), the sandwich was practically made. Fast service for sure. Smiles a plenty.  There's a comfy, long bar-height table, where you can sit and eat. There are little booth seats as well where you can sit. It's a typical Jimmy John's. There's not a ton of room to grab drinks if you're in a power chair or wheel chair.  Location Note: It's so incredibly sad that this strip mall doesn't take advantage of the HUGE mountain views it has behind it. I'm sorry there are no second story floors with windows but, that's not Jimmy John's fault. The developers shot themselves in the foot.  So, just walk outside and look up before you take off. Just saying. Great spot if you like the outdoors.  I snapped a photo which I'll try to post from the Starbucks drive thru on the NW corner of Power and McDowell staring over at this Jimmy John's behind CVS. It's a beacon now, sitting a store or two over from Smash Burger and Chipotle :)"}
{"text":"I tried this place out because they were popping up everywhere! Well, here it goes...   I had the #5 (Vito- The original Italian sub with Genoa salami, provolone, capicola, onion, lettuce, tomato & a real tasty Italian vinaigrette). There was NOTHING special about this sub. It tasted very plain, and I did not feel full or satisfied after eating it. It was an 8\" sub. I am 5'3 and weigh 115. I should have been full, right? The bread was cold and there was barely any meat in the sub.   In addition to the lack of good food, the dinning area was a MESS! There was food all on the floor and on the tables. I walked around the place twice before I could find napkins. (They were behind the counter where they made the subs.) The worse part though was the crappy music they were playing. It was sooooo LOUD! I sat at the booth against the wall where a speaker was hanging, and I am not joking when I say I could feel the vibration very well. The staff seemed lost too, except their manager who seemed like a meany.   In conclusion, don't waste your time or money. For $5 you can probably find something that tastes better and fills you up."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service terrible, refused to deliver half block out of their \"area\"."}
{"text":"Food is great but service is terrible.  Ordered delivery but refused to deliver half block past their \"area\" employee said \"you're in a dead zone\".  Amazing that half a block is such a problem to sell your food.  Could at least give the option to charge extra."}
{"text":"Never ate here but I witnessed a delivery driver leave this store today in a silver Toyota with a black girl driving pull out of the store, drive into oncoming traffic, almost cause an accident then she flipped the guy she almost hit the finger..."}
{"text":"I had my sandwich ordered and it was great, love them everyday all day... but when the manager starts yelling at one of thier employees \"to get the fuck out of the store\" for making a cheese joke? kinda turns me off to the them... maybe I will try a different store.. maybe."}
{"text":"Great food & great service when ordering as always :-)  Now ask to use the restroom after 12midnight & their A+ customer service does a 180 & goes to down right rude.  I was honestly surprised at how disrespectful their staff was when I asked why their restrooms were closed & when I inquired more about the policy 3 staff members were so down right rude I simply walked out.  This location needs a serious attitude adjustment, which is too bad cause the food itself is great!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I go there for lunch often and they have some of the best cold subs around. Far better than subway. It's a little weird having greetings yelled at you when you walk in the door but I guess that's just company policy. The bread is awesome and totally makes the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Was going to order online.. The entire process was such a hassle and in the end I was told I cannot order online.. I guess I can take my business and money elsewhere.. If there was a way to rate with negative stars, I certainly would!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered numerous times, mostly delivery and am a fan. They deliver quickly and usually without error. There's been a few times where they have messed up a few orders but have corrected it when I called. The sandwiches taste great and are made well, however I ask for extra extra hot peppers and they never seem to put enough. If they would load it up with hot peppers when I make an extra effort to let them know I want them, they would be a perfect establishment. Great place, great food and friendly people here is why I'll be a return customer."}
{"text":"I would change the name to Suckey Johns. First and last visit to this horrible chain restaurant. Really, why did I stop here? You know those kids in your neighborhood that sell the cold soggy submarine sandwiches for high school fundraisers... Jimmy and John must have invented that concept. I ordered the number 5, vito sub sandwich and out came a cold hard tasteless waste of calories. They call that a Vito? I think Vito oughta bring Tony Soprano,  Paulie Walnuts and Christopher down here,  and show these what a ghomba  ass whooping is all about. Even Johnny Sac wouldn't eat this garbage and he's in jail!  Don't eat here! Don't eat here! Possible to give it a half a star I would have. Granted, it's cheap but you're better off with a  bag and burned microwave popcorn from Walmart."}
{"text":"Ate here recently and had a great experience. The 3 employees were extremely polite and hard working. In fact, I was so impressed with the service that I went home and wrote a positive review directly to the company. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very fast, very good, driver was professional and prompt and the sandwich tasted like a million bucks"}
{"text":"This place seriously needs to get its crap together! This is the second time that we have waited for over an hour for our sandwiches. Jimmy John's is directly across the street from my place of business. The tardiness is unacceptable. Please get new management. Or please get some delivery drivers that can make trips over to our office. I am seriously considering telling everyone I know here to not order from this place at all costs"}
{"text":"Ok went to jimmy johns and Firehouse subs to see who's tuna sandwich is better. (For my taste) I know your thinking who goes to firehouse for tuna? This guy does. Plus the lady working the counter was like \"odd two people ordered tuna today.\"  They both cost about the same.  Ok first off lets go by how fast food came out. Jimmy johns wins. those dudes pump those things out like nobody's business. I pay and boom sandwich in hand. Firehouse I had to wait a bit longer but still didn't take too long.   Taste is a toss up. I preferred the actual tuna in the jimmy johns. It had more crunch from the veggies. Now firehouses one held up better because the bread is softer. I feel like my teeth are not sharp enough to bite thou jimmy johns bread sometimes. And when my teeth finally get thou delicious bread, it decides to leak white fluid that will smell and look like all sorts of body fluid.  (You take ur pick.... They all dry white....)   It's hard to pick a winner because I want to say the flavor is better on the JJ, but I ate more of firehouses. Just because it was easier to eat . I don't want to go about my day smelling like tuna. I'm can't tell you why but i am leaning to jimmy johns don't know why. But still both are leaps and bounds better than subway. Time to go find a breath mint to wash down the shame that is this review. Do people even read these?"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Jimmy John's. I ordered online and it arrived in under 10 minutes. That was great! I tried the #1 Pepe. I believe you get more meat at Subway but the menu looks like it has options for larger sandwiches. The bread is a little bit harder than Subway as well. The BBQ chips are amazing- kettle corn style. I also tried their chocolate chunk cookie. The cookie was very dry and bland so I will not get that again. Other than that, I will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Sandwich is acceptable. But really, it's dead in here, there are a number of employees standing around yet 2/3rds of the tables/counters are dirty. Gross."}
{"text":"For a Jimmy Johns, this place is great. So fast. Sandwich is always just as I like it.   I'm not giving it 5 stars because Jimmy Johns is the best food, but because if you like Jimmy Johns (as I do) it's a very good one.   I would normally reserve 5 stars for a place with more panache, like Fat Ox ($$$) or Paradise Valley Burger ($), but I feel loyal because this is my go-to place."}
{"text":"I've never been to this Jimmy John's, but I ordered delivery at 2:30 AM to my dorm room. The delivery biker had my sanwich there in SIX minutes flat. He then welcomed me to the area and shared his knowledge about the ASU Tempe campus with me. The Bacon Ham sandwich itself would've earned 3 stars, but the excellent service is what gets 5 stars"}
{"text":"We stopped at Jimmy johns for a late night meal.  Asked for a turkey sub with no veggies and they gave me turkey lunch meat wrapped in lettuce.  I returned the sub and asked them to remake it, at which point they gave me a sub which consisted of bread and ONLY lettuce,  no meat.  At this point I was clearly upset and had them make it a 3rd time.  As other reviewers have stated, their late night customer services is down right rude.  The manager was not helpful, nor professional at all.  He starred at us the entire time we were there to eat our subs, and gave us dirty looks.  The owners should probably reevaluate their sub artists on the late night shift, and especially should fire the manager."}
{"text":"Friends brought Jimmy Johns box of little sandwiches (whatever you call that choice) to a Chrismtas party.  It was amazing.  The subs went faster than the deviled eggs.  They tasted great and were so easy for my friends (She hates cooking!)  Will definitely remember that the next time I'm invited to a party and need to bring a dish to pass"}
{"text":"I placed an order for a number 16 club Loulou and a number eight billy club, which I have to say are absolutely delicious. Not only was the freshness of our food a delight, but how quickly we received it on delivery was incredible! We had our order at the door and sitting down to eat within 20 minutes of placing the order! Bravo Jimmy John's, will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see a sub place that delivered in the area.  We now have another option rather than pizza or chinese food.  And they deliver until 10pm!  They can be fast on delivery, if they know where they are going.   I have waited up to almost an hour before, and we are literally kiddy-corner from the store.  The sandwiches are good and filling but I don't get the hype.  The tuna salad is ok, a little it on the onion-y side.  They don't have but 2 bread options - an 8\" white roll or regular thick cut multi-grain bread.  We do order from here about once a week solely based on the convenience of delivery.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this location the first time and my sandwich was missing some ingredients. I decided to give it another shot since the other locations I've ordered from in the past have been great. Not this one though. Second time around was worse - BOTH of our sandwiches were missing ingredients, the bread was very hard, and they forgot to include everything we ordered. Really?? I'm sorry that I wasted my money on this. Looks like you've lost another customer."}
{"text":"AMAZING SUBS!  #4 with cheese!! Super fast drive-thru! Always busy, but wait time is nothing. Always zip right through. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Not only was the guy making the sandwich a jerk but he messed up my sandwich. Maybe spend more time doing your job and less time yelling at your coworkers."}
{"text":"Cody and his team are the best. There was a man harassing my friend and I outside the store for something traffic related and after many threats and vulgar language one of the employees came and diffused the situation. Afterwards Cody and his team made sure to make us feel safe and welcome and we couldn't thank them enough. We will definitely be coming back to the store as the service was fast, the food was delicious, and the people were the best.   Thanks Cody! From the dude with the glasses who shook your hand."}
{"text":"Never had an issue/problem with any of the Jimmy John's until this location on Elliot/West of the 101.  Employees are not friendly and just talk to each other instead of the customer.  I visited this location twice in about a week 1/2, and both times had an issue with the same girl. (I did not get her name, but she has a nose piercing.) First time I came she started to make my sandwich, then left to ring up a customer on the register (with her gloves on), and then after ringing up the customer, came back to finish my sandwiches (with the same gloves on...EWWWW!) When I went back a few days later....unfortunately the same issue with her.  I thought I was going to have better luck with the guy that rang me up.  It looked like he was going to make my sandwiches next, but then she started making them, (with her gloves on). Then,  the phone rang and she left to go answer it and take the phone order, then she came back and finished making my sandwiches (with the same gloves on!)  She didn't put new ones on like she should have after touching the gross phone. This location needs some revamping with employee training.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"For a sandwich place I love Jimmy John's! This location in particular has really tight parking and no drive-through... However, if you're planning on going and sitting down to eat and the weather outside is nice, they have a good amount of outdoor chairs and tables with umbrellas. Sanwiches are really good-- I always order the Beach Club (#12) as is.  AND they really are freaky fast... My sandwich was ready before I could put my wallet back in my purse! -B"}
{"text":"After many visits to San Antonio Texas I became a fan of Jimmy John's along time ago. I only wish we had more locations in Las Vegas, or at least one that delivered to my address.  However, the Jimmy John's location on Durango is by far my favorite! Their sandwiches are always fresh, fast, and delicious!! As stated before my favorite is the #12 which is the beach club and they really are freaky fast, but to make it even better this location has a drive-thru!  An always friendly staff, it's quick & convenient, fresh & delicious, and relatively inexpensive--a good choice overall. -B"}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is fast,fresh and good. They would be that much better if they sold hot sandwhiches."}
{"text":"This location is comparable to other locations, which is to say that they make pretty good sandwiches, and quickly. My one complaint about this location - why is the delivery radius so small? I was only 3 miles away, but could not get delivery. So sad!"}
{"text":"I think one of their mottos is something like, \"Delivery so fast you'll freak\" and they are not kidding!  Now granted, I used to work right across Baseline, so they didn't have far to travel, but I would order online, click Submit, and the delivery guy would be at my office door within 5 minutes.  Freaky fast!  How is that even possible?  I would estimate that the Sub sandwiches have about half of the contents of the Giant Club Sandwiches.  While I really enjoy the Italian Night Club, I just can't finish it, so I switched the Vito and that's just right.  The sandwiches don't have pickles on them, but you can order a giant deli pickle on the side and they offer it whole, halved, or quartered.  The online ordering system is really efficient and allows you to order exactly what you want; plus this, minus that, extra this, etc.  Are they the greatest subs in the whole world?  Well, no, but they are good and the price and quick service make it a great deal.  My new office is just 2 miles away (still within the delivery range) so I'm interested to find out how fast delivery will be."}
{"text":"Ordered the beach sandwich. It tasted very bland so I asked for a pickle to help with that. They tried to charge me $1.80 for a friggin PICKLE! When did pickles get so expensive?? What a bunch of Terds. Won't be back for your sub par sub. And keep your golden fucking pickles."}
{"text":"Always friendly and fast delivery. I'm not picky about my food like some of these other people so I have nothing to complain about!"}
{"text":"I ordered from thos place and it took them an hour to deliver my order and they forgot my soda. When I called the store they told me they couldn't take the soda off. I will no longer order from here.b"}
{"text":"I LOVE JIMMY JOHNS!!!!    Delicious, fast, fresh, cheap, and they'll even deliver just one sandwich!!  Plus they're open late, to cater to the night crowd.       I order from them at least twice a week, and usually get the turkey tom or the beach club. Their bread is delicious; they use real meats and cheeses (unlike Subway), and even have fresh sprouts (yum!).   They don't toast their subs, so don't ask them  :)"}
{"text":"Ordered a couple sandwiches at 12:17, they didn't arrive until 1:10. Sandwiches so fast you'll freak? No. I was freaking because my time was wasted and I didn't get to eat before having to clock back in from lunch. But hey, they got paid right? That's all that matters right?    Bottom line, something that takes less that a minute to make and delivering it less than two miles away shouldn't take close to an hour. The sandwiches are par at best to boot so it's not like you're waiting on fine dining. A monkey could run and operate one of these business with the help of an accountant.    Get it together Chim Chim so you can retain any lingering customers, besides me, that you can."}
{"text":"Don't know about all the bad reviews.  Everytime I go there, they are Freaky Fast.  I usually have the #16 Club Lulu and before I even take a seat they're already done with my sandwich.  The sandwiches are delicious and the bread they use hold up so well that I can save half my sandwich for later in the day and it doesn't get soggy.  Two things to consider when going to JJ's, 1) Be prepared to listen for your sandwich number and sandwich name (ie. #16 for the Club Lulu as this is what they usually call your order by) right after you order.  2) You bag your own sandwiches (the bags and napkins are right below/behind the sandwiches that they place on the little counter."}
{"text":"I order delivery about once a month. They do deliver in a timely manner but they always forget to put cucumbers on my beach club. The cucumbers are literally the only reason i get this sandwich. I love cucumbers. I shouldn't have to tell them how to make the sandwich especially when I'm paying 10 dollars for a damn sandwich . But I guess from now on I'm going to have to. Anyways, it was still good. Not as good as it would be with those delicious cucumbers slathered in mayo. I'm gross I know lol. I love their bread tho. Well that's all I have to say. Thanks."}
{"text":"Tried to pay with a $100 and the girl said they are not a bank. If it was a guy would have popped off and amused myself at their expense.  Just shut up and make my sandwich dude. Nope, thank you ma'am I'll do debit"}
{"text":"This was the first JJ's I ever ate at. The army of sandwich artists working at this location had our sandwiches made literally 10 seconds after we ordered, beating out all of the other locations across the U.S. I've been to. Everything was made as ordered and tasted great."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff!  Greeted with a Hello and usually no line.  One time I ordered and fumbled around looking for my debit card and my sub was done before I finished paying for it...and then the guy joked \"sorry about the wait\"  :)"}
{"text":"Watching the staff bounce around behind the counter, my first thought was -  'ah yes, the classic franchise driven by caffeinated high school students (or college students? I have difficulty discerning now in my old age...)' - then I understood where all the energy was headed...  Like a small sandwich making dynamo - your order is taken and then, bam-bam, a tasty sub shoots out.  I'm stuck on the Beach Club - solid combo of cucu, avo, sprouts, turkey, and mayo - the bread is good too...    They are sharp, efficient, and they equally have enough consideration to say 'thanks for coming...' - that goes a long way...  Welcome to the neighborhood JJ..."}
{"text":"I've been back a handful of times since my last review and had great experiences. Still wish they delivered to my house lol but the owner was nice enough to reach out explain their policy and why they can't deliver to me even though I'm so close. Good sandwiches, good prices AND a drive through! Can't beat it...."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with this location i just tried to go and the door was locked 10 min before close! This is the second time this has happened. I love the food IF they were open."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, and FAST!  It's shotgun style, so seating is limited, but the decor is fun and entertaining (funny signs, etc).    They don't have their hours posted on the door and we went in before they were open one day but they served us anyway!  Great service, although sometimes the bread can seem a little stale, but it's always delicious."}
{"text":"R people serious with there bad reviews does this look like some uppity sandwich spot. It's simple a sandwich, chips, and drink... sounds like perfection to me... there for sure better then subway I'll be honest!"}
{"text":"their food is good unlike their service, me and my family won't be returning to that locating again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Beach Club because I was in a hurry, expecting it to be subpar, but surprisingly it was pretty delicious! Fast service as well, my sandwich came out before I could even sit down."}
{"text":"7 MINUTES. From call placed to knock on door. I've ordered multiple times from this location and the order is fast and accurate."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches. The customer service is not the best and the employees seemed more in tuned with the loud music playing than actually helping the customers. Also really small delivery area for the location. We are just a little over a mile from them and they don't deliver and we ask the employees why not no one has been able to answer us yet. Other than that great sandwiches and chips and the price is right."}
{"text":"I love JJ's. Here's what I love about them:  - \"Freaky\" fast (like, by the time you are done paying and putting your change away, your sandwich is ready) - Very clean interior - Clever, hip angle - Mega friendly staff (so refreshing since most of them are HS or college-aged, normally the rudest, most self-involved set, but these ones are SOOO friendly and nice it's obviously company culture) - Their bread (yummm) - The Vito - Very reasonable prices  I could go on. They deliver, but not to my house, which is aggravating, but hell, I will drive to them! I love JJ's!"}
{"text":"No napkins. F ing really. Management here sucks and I almost got T boned from the very freaky fast delivery driver speeding into the place. I will never order from any JJ again. Go to ikes right around the corner."}
{"text":"Hey thanks guys for not making our sandwiches correctly... Whe someone says no mayo and yet you put it on and then scrape it off???? Thanks for the poor service and quality and food... I will ordered elsewhere for my employees.."}
{"text":"I came to this location tonight at 9:50 pm. The hours state they close at 10. The door was unlocked and there were two people inside. I walked in to them telling me it was closed. When I asked the hours, they said they close at 10 but they  cleaned everything up early.   If your hours state 10:00pm is closing time and your door is open, you should be serving customers until 10:00 pm no matter how slow you are."}
{"text":"Typical Jimmy John's sandwiches, but TERRIBLE delivery. They do not know what freaky fast is. I could have walked there, gotten my sandwich, eaten, and walked back before my sandwich was delivered."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and in the past it has been great. This time however was borderline rude and unprofessional. I ordered a sandwich with sprouts, and overheard the crew repeat the order, but without sprouts, so I mentioned it to the lady at the register. She fired back a snobby look and a \"I heard you the first time sir\". On the way out I doublechecked again on the sprouts. Again I was met with an air of disrespect. Guess what ? I came home and No Sprouts. I'll survive without sprouts but your store needs customers, and acting like this chases them away. By the way, the sandwich tastes good but it still leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!! Called at 12 to have 2 sandwiches delivered to my work. Called back at 12:50 to cancel since my lunch was over, not only did I get an attitude from an employee AND the manager, they hung up on me. Delivery guy showed up at 1:10 after I already canceled the order and could get my lunch since it was over 20 min prior. So upset. Never ordering from there again"}
{"text":"I actually really like the subs at Jimmy John's.  They're pretty much no-nonsense quick cold subs.  No salads, no soups, no toasting.  You can get chips and a cookie if you want, but that's pretty much all for sides.  (I think they might have pickles too?)  Anywho, the subs are huge and tasty and very quick!"}
{"text":"You know why they're so \"fast\" at making sandwiches? Because there's no toppings except like, lettuce, onion and tomato. Boring.  Also, these places are way overstaffed. And they're not very knowledgable. I have food alergies I have to watch out for, and I went in the other day and asked what was in their \"special sauce\" (whatever it's called) on their tuna sandwich.........there were SIX (6) employees behind the counter and they all just looked dumbfounded. Shouldn't your employees know what's in the food?? Annoying. So I stuck with my usual turkey.  Anyway, to the food. One thing I LOVE about this place is they make \"unwiches\" which is like a sandwich, but instead of bread, it's a lettuce wrap. This is great for me because I can't eat bread, but sometimes I really crave some turkey and salami on a sandwich.   Small tip: if you don't like a TON of mayo, make sure to mention it, because they load this stuff with it otherwise.  EDIT:  Well, looks like I won't ever be eating here again. http://www.bilerico.com/2012/05/more_than_one_reason_not_to_eat_at_jimmy_johns.php"}
{"text":"I went to the location in Gilbert. Was not impressed at all. Thought I was going to have to visit the dentist after eating there. The bread was so tough. Left with a wtf feeling and realized I should've went next door to Culvers."}
{"text":"I have to say I love jimmy john's....  I tried it when it first opened and I have to say that I am a regular.  Since I eat here so often I wish that they would  issue stamp cards so I can get a free sandwich...  = )  (hint, hint)  Oh well I'm sure I'll  be back... I always get the #9, its soo good. They make the sandwiches so fast and I heard that they deliver."}
{"text":"The staff tend to be rude, the drivers tailgate, and the sandwiches are always bland and over-priced. Avoid."}
{"text":"One more rave review.  Honestly, I can't say why I like them so much, it's just a freakin' sub, right?  But I guess it's not \"just\".  The bread is fresh, it's chewy without being stale.  Lots of mayo on the subs, so if that's a problem for you be sure and let them know.  The meats are fresh.  Every location i've been to (Mill Ave, Via de Ventura/Indian Bend, Tempe Marketplace) has been really quick and super friendly."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is my favorite sandwich place ever.  I always get the gourmet veggie sandwich.  Not only is it tasty, it's enormous, and a bargain considering how many vegetables I'd probably waste if I assembled it myself from grocery shopping.  It doesn't hurt that I have good memories associated with the company too, like when my summer school teacher ordered us subs to get us through an especially long class session.  Plus you get free smells!  (You just have to pay for the food.)"}
{"text":"Today Jimmy John's ran a $1 sub special from 11 am to 3 pm.  This was advertised in a Full Page Ad in the Arizona Republic.  We went around noon but the line was too long and so thought we would come back closer to the ending time for the deal i.e 3 pm.  We were there at around 2:45 pm and they told us that they were No Longer Honoring  the Deal.    No consideration was given that the customer spent their time and gas to come there with the knowledge that the deal would be honored.  The FULL Page Ad in the Arizona Republic specifically said it was till 3 pm and it did not have any exceptions or restrictions whatsoever.  I cannot support a local business that clearly breaks its own promise.    I will never step into a Jimmy John's when there is Subway, Blimpie's, Quiznos, Firehouse, Jersey Mikes, Jason's Deli, and so many more options."}
{"text":"Staff always great. Usually really quick even when line is long. Bread always soft. However today they messed up my sandwich which is fine but the workers starting arguing and cussing at each other. It was pretty comical."}
{"text":"Freaky slow more like it. Ordered 2 Sammys @ 7:20 p. Arrived at 8:25pm. Soggy, delivered by a driver who seemed annoyed with us because he was late?! It'd be faster to order pizza. Next time we'll just go to Subway."}
{"text":"Jimmy johns subs are very good, but so much for their freaky fast delivery.  I order from the store at about 3rd st and bell rd and I live less than a mile from their location and i have only had them deliver within 30 minutes 2 times, but it usually takes about an hour and i order from them at least one time per week.  I have learned that if im going to order from them to make sure that I am not in a rush.  For instance, I ordered from them at 11:36 figuring I would have time to eat because i had somewhere i had to be at 1 and 12:45 rolls around and still nothing so i called and they said the sandwich should be there in about 5 minutes because they had other deliveries they had to make, so i was screwed and had to cancel my order and hurry up and head out for a meeting, and then they argued with me saying just stay there its on its way and i told them i cant that i have to go and be somewhere at 1.  Good sandwiches, horrible delivery services.  average wait time about 50 minutes to an hour and i have had them deliver at least 20 times to my place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!   Staff was super helpful and very nice!!  Service was unexpectedly fast even on dollar sub night!!  Definitely recommend going here if you need a quick lunch or a bite after work   Service is fast and super affordable prices.  No offense to subway but JimmyJohn's is the Best!!   Great job guys keep up the goodwork!"}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times in the past few years so I always forget what to order, but the staff is super patient and helped me choose the perfect sandwich for me. I love that you can ask them to cut it in half! And as always, the sandwich is ready 'freaky fast'!"}
{"text":"Dear Jimmy John's,  Your kids are often smart assey and your ice machine is a joke.  And eating inside your location at 1650 E Camelback could be a nerve wracking experience.  But your #5 and #9 can make any bad day better.  And for that, I love you."}
{"text":"I order the Tuna and they always make it great.  I've never had a bad experience with this store, but I also order inside and take it to go, I've never gotten delivery from them.  They use the right portions and it's never drowning in sauce or oil.  If I want a tuna sandwich I know I can come here and always get a good one.  Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's was on campus today handing out free sandwiches, so I have to thank them for minimizing the disappointment I felt upon tasting their \"tasty sandwiches.\"  It would have been much worse had I paid for it.  I had the #6 Vegetarian, which they claim is \"Truly a gourmet sub not for vegetarians only.\"   \"Not for vegetarians only\"? In a sense they are right. They would be much better marketing it to an advanced-aged demographic that prefers food that has a certain blandness to it.  Most vegetarians, I think, would be turned off by the lack of flavor, wealth of iceburg lettuce, and cakes of mayo.  I guess the inclusion of sprouts on the sandwich entitles them to use the descriptive \"gourmet.\"  Seriously though, if you want a vegetarian sandwich, skip this place.....Thanks for the freebie."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is the home of free smells and they are finally in the Phoenix area with 3 stores that I know of - Downtown Tempe on Mill, Rural and Baseline next to Whole Foods and Rural-ish and Ellitot-ish.  They keep it very simple at JJ's using fresh meats, cheeses, and fresh daily bread.  The bread makes the whole sandwich as it is a great mix of crispy outside and chewy inside.  I go for the #6 - Veggie Sub.  It has Fresh (actually red which you don't see at most fast sandwich/sub shops) Tomatoes, Provolone, Cucumbers, Sprouts, Avocado Spread and Helman's Mayo.  That's right they use real mayo, which is a little fatty, but worth the calories at the end of the day.    I like that there is not any fussing over the size of sandwich - either a sub that is plenty big or you can go with a sandwich on wheat bread.  Quick, simple, free smells, and dependable."}
{"text":"I love the food food here, always fast, quick & easy. Usually the customer service is fantastic but today the cashier gave me attitude & I didn't appreciate it. I ordered a #1 combo, no cheese. She automatically rang me for a large without asking if I wanted a medium or large. I noticed it when she handed me the larger cup & I mentioned I wanted the medium. She said \"it's only 20 cents more\". I said but you didn't even ask me. She said \"so you want your 22 cents back?\", with an attitude like your gonna bother me for only 22 cents, it's only 22 cents. Just out of principle at that point I said \"yes\". Please don't tell me how I'm gonna spend my money. It's 22 cents of my hard earned money I didn't want to spend. Next time just ask & don't give attitude when a customer wants \"their\" money. If you count 22 cents for every time you go out & eat, it's adds up pretty quick."}
{"text":"So I love JJ, but this place would not know what customer service was if it hit them in the face. The lady taking my order never even said hello or look me in the face. The guy who brought my sub kind of tossed it on my table. No \"enjoy\" or \"need anything else\" just \"here\". I will never go back to this place. I will just get it brought to me from now on because face to face interaction with this store is apparently an opportunity for them."}
{"text":"Had good, fast service here.  As I was finishing up, an employee started sweeping the door mat furiously as I was sitting at the table right next to it.  Oblivious to what he was doing.  The other employees just sat there and laughed.  Also, there are no napkins to be found anywhere.  Not on tables, not on counter.  Had to ask.  Find out they keep them behind the counter.  Been here several times and its the same thing every time.  Bad experience, wont go back."}
{"text":"Some of the neon lights were on so I came rolling through the drive-thru at 9:30 this morning hoping I could order some sandwiches for a lunch meeting I and today.  Damon immediately answered the drive-thru asking what I wanted so I assumed they were open...  I paid, got my sandwiches and right before I pulled off asked \"Hey...what time do you guys open.\"  He shrugged and said \"11am\"  Now THAT is what I call service.  I mean, how many times have you been to a drive-thru 2 minutes before opening or even two minutes before closing and the kid on the other end of the speaker says \"Sorry.  We're closed.\"  And here, at the Jimmy John's on Harris Corners Pkwy, I show up an HOUR AND A HALF early and they gladly put together an order for me without a single subtle hint of \"hey lady, we are not even close to open yet.\"    Thanks for making my day, Damon and team.  You guys deserve a raise!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, Their approach to food is different from subway, the food is always high quality and fast. As it should be. In fact, They are even faster than subway. The moment you order, it is done without minutes. Sometimes it can get busy but the time you wait is reasonably fast. In terms of price, all the sub's are priced about 1$ higher than subway, but not a big deal, everything is very cheap and affordable still. And this Tempe location has excellent customer service and is very kind.  I suppose the only down side to this restaurant is that you can not customize the sub's. Which is not really an complaint."}
{"text":"Much better option for a sub than the Subways on campus. Take a nice stroll over here. The place is usually not that busy. So give them some more business! The staff are nice, the place is clean, and of course they're freaky fast."}
{"text":"Love Jimmy Johns!  Made my sandwich exactly as ordered, fresh with quality ingredients.  Super friendly staff and manager!"}
{"text":"I always get great sandwiches at JJs, but I have eaten at this location 3 times and the bread is always stale."}
{"text":"Cute part of town. Clean and fun atmosphere.  Sandwiches were good, nothing amazing.  I needed Italian dressing added to make my Veggie have more flavor."}
{"text":"I had Jimmy John's before in south Dakota.  I've never seen one out in Arizona so I stopped in today.  After ordering I got a bland sandwich.  I had asked for extra tomatoes but none were found. The sandwich maker told me later when I asked again for extra tomatoes which didn't come on the sandwich, \"it's against company policy. \" I replied no problem it's the last time im coming back to JJ's. Over seven dollars for an average sandwich with no drink or chips. No thanks. At least at subway they ask what you want on the sandwich and you get what you want. Here no way."}
{"text":"Good subs, good price, delivery on time. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"Truly don't understand all the hype about this sandwich shop (no salads). The young staff was smiling and pleasant, but the sandwich was a joke!  Almost $6 for nothing but a few slices of meh turkey and lettuce/tomato and a bare condiment selection. (Almost everything else was an add-on). A complete waste of money.  After looking at the bread, I do believe the company has people hoodwinked to believe that a tiny portion of meat with some salad pieces can be justified if stuffed between two thick pieces of fattening bread! My first - and only visit!"}
{"text":"Nah, never again. A mediocre (at best) sandwich and grossly overpriced beverages. A very poor value for one's money, I thought; and I found negativity from the counter help that surpassed the unhelpful and approached the hostile. There's a Subway close by that's a better bet, I think; and I've never been ignored for several minutes at a Subway counter, as I was here."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches. Fresh!! We all know the bread will make or break a good sandwich and Jimmy John's has it spot on. Delish!!"}
{"text":"My significant other and I get delivery from here often and the food and service is exactly as advertised. Apparently some other people have not had a good experience at this location, but that has not been the case for us. Their deliveries are fast, and the drivers are always polite. The food is incredibly consistent, which is one of the reasons we often order from this location. We always know exactly what to expect and I appreciate that. I have never liked Subway subs, I have always felt that their food was gross and over processed, but JJ's is simple, tastes great, and seems more wholesome than other sub alternatives. When I order take out in the store the peeps working are friendly and get the job done quick. Tasty subs made quickly with a smile, what more can you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Walked into Jimmy John's at 6pm on 10/31 to see a man with a large dog waiting for food at the pickup end of the counter. The dog was not a seeing eye dog, or one in training. Dog had its front feet up on the counter, and the people behind the counter were talking to the dog. Pretty disgusting for food being prepared 1 or 2 feet away. No thanks."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed, I would say the ownership and lack of quality employees makes the place mediocre at best. The bread is so heavy, it made me nauseous for a day, and god forbid you ask for any of the freebies you get frowned upon as if you're asking for their bank account information. Not to mention the globs of Mayo they add to these sandwiches and the soggy shredded lettuce and store bought tasting guacamole they put on the Beach Club. Pretty cheap for an expensive sandwich. DISGUST. The owners I believe, a tall guy with green eyes is always touching his nose and his obscenely tan shorter comrade are both very snooty and stuck up. The tan one less so, he seemed a little friendlier. And then the African American kid with braces that claims to be the manager that hates his job? I could literally die. Anywho, after giving that place the benefit of the doubt thinking maybe these were all isolated incidents (which they're not) I have decided to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I loved Jimmy John's.  But recently there is something seriously wrong at this location on Arizona Ave. I always order a Slim 5, its just bread, meat and cheese.  But the past 5 times I've ordered this simple sandwich, they manage to screw it up. Its always missing cheese or they give me a #5 with all the condiments on it (im the pickiest eater in world and hate condiments on my sandwich). I can understand how a slim 5 and #5 could get mixed up but the other 4 times, the cheese is missing!  How difficult can it be to put cheese and meat on bread? Really now. Maybe if the manager would stop juggling sandwiches, dropping them on the floor then serving those sandwiches to customers,  and pay more attention to what the staff is doing, there wouldn't be a problem. But when I see the manager messing around plus 12 employees working, I can't even understand why the hell they forget the fucking cheese!!!! Ridiculous. I called and complained and left a survey for corporate,  now they're blowing up my phone trying to \"make it right\" with me, again, for the 5th time. And calling me as much as they have is harassment. This is how you make it right Jimmy John's... PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING. Stop fucking around and do your job, its really not that difficult.  You've lost a very loyal customer who came there weekly and ordered catering often. All this because of your negligence over a few pieces of cheese. How sad."}
{"text":"AMAZING customer service!  My sandwich is usually done before I'm finished paying for it! I've never been to a more clean efficient good place before!   The manager beau is always extremely friendly and helpful whenever I'm in the store.  In fact,  once when I was delivered the wrong sandwich,  beau delivered the correct one himself!  Talk about customer service!  If you like happiness,  eat here."}
{"text":"I have never been to a jimmy johns at least that I can remember, it was very good much better than a subway, still not as good as firehouse subs that is why I only gave it 4 stars but, they are freaky fast by the time you are finished paying your subs is ready. I will be back to this location. Super friendly staff"}
{"text":"On August 7, 2014, I stopped by Jimmy John's around closing. I didn't get the names of the two employees left working that night but they were so nice to me & went out of their way to serve me.  I really appreciated their kindness & service.  Of course my sandwich was delicious! Thank you two again."}
{"text":"I frequent this place quite often as they have decent fast food at a decent price, an overall good value. What I can't seem to ever grasp is that they are doing their cleaning at the height of the lunch service. What prompted me to review was that today there was an employee STANDING ON THE COUNTER WHERE THE SANDWICHES ARE BEING MADE HANGING A SIGN!!! Where is common sense??? Also you could tell that they decided to use up the old bread as it was stale, not fresh like it usually is.   Disappointed at this place....."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is known for their freaky fast food right? Well not at this one. After an hour and a half and 4 phone calls later our food finally arrived. Drivers excuse...... I got lost. Really? Its a straight shot and less then a mile away. I can't believe that the management hasn't done something about this. It looks as if this is an ongoing issue with this location. I will give them this much. The food as always tasted great(even though it was soggy). Hopefully they get this issue resolved soon."}
{"text":"They are crazy fast! Love the service and the food. Order the unwich. Delish!  Add avocado, oregano, oil and vinegar.  Soooooo good"}
{"text":"When they say quick delivery, they mean it!  These guys are always so fast.  How do they do that?!  Every time I order from here, it's no more than 10 minutes until they are at my door.  Amazing.  They have a really awesome online ordering site that's way quicker than trying to call anything in.    I have a pretty picky 9 year old and she will eat these sandwiches.  They are straightforward and good without a lot of frills.  I really like that they aren't downing in mayo like a lot of other sandwich chains.    If you're in the area, give them a shot."}
{"text":"Always been a fan of Jimmy Johns . Recently new to Charlotte I always look for my favorites first! Freak fast is always great & of course everything is fresh!! Being sick today and not eating in two days this was great and right on time!!! Ready for a nap!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say but this was the worst sandwich place  we have ever been to. They claim they have the best gourmet sandwiches around...I wonder how they can make this claim?! They have only one type of cheese, provolone to be exact, and only put 1 layer of meat on the sandwich. I'm sorry but when I think of \"gourmet\" I think of turkey pesto with salami and tomato on a Dutch crunch roll or a chicken caprese on a ciabatta bread. I can make better sandwiches at home. For what it's worth, they do make them fast. But please don't claim to make gourmet sandwiches. It's absolutely deceiving!"}
{"text":"I don't understand peoples fascination with this place. Yeah they're fast, but they aren't very good. I'd rather wait the whole extra five minutes it would take to make a good sandwich. Having only been once I hope my experience was unusual, but I feel no need to let them redeem themselves when there are plenty of other good, cheap sandwich places."}
{"text":"All that I can say is YUM.  Please, open up a place in old town! JJ is fast, cheap and delicious.  Personally, I'm obsessed with the bootlegger club.   MMMMMM good I do wish that you could get pickles on the sandwiches though; I'm not a fan of having to buy a massive kosher dill when all that I want is a few slices of pickle."}
{"text":"Customer service leaves a lot to be desired. You can do better across the street!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty freakin good. This new location just opened by my house. Their subs are less than the cost of Subway and the quality is way better. It's fast if you walk in but they also have a drive through and they deliver. I also like the decor in the resturant."}
{"text":"Love this place. We always go here or get delivery. I got the Vito #5 sandwich tonight, it's delicious!! Like all their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Yuck! Hard dry bread! Put cucumbers on my hubbys sandwich which he dislikes , instead of mine. Bland no flavor. I asked for no mayo but add Dijon mustard...nowhere to be found. $19 including $4 tip? Wish subway delivered!  One star is for the delivery kid, he was very nice. Won't waste my $ there again!"}
{"text":"Totally agree regarding delivery, totally ridiculous, I'm 2.35 miles from them and they won't deliver to me. Although as I told them in my email, I have seen their delivery car drive past my house. They responded to me but did not address that point. Hey, you don't want my money? You got it. Hope you can stay in business delivering to two houses.  Here is their response, which is totally and utterly ridiculous. During rush hour I timed it at 4 min.   \"I did double check the address below with our team, and unfortunately the address is not close enough to a Jimmy John's to receive delivery. When a store first opens we have our team drive during the busiest parts of the day a 3-5 minute range, rather than mileage to determine our boundaries\"  Must just be this store, I work in Ballantyne and it takes them 15 min to delivery to our office. If I would ever order from JJ again, which I will not, I would have to complain to that store that I didn't get my food in 5 min.  Oh, and regarding their response, so you only deliver during the busiest parts of the day? What about the parts of the day where it would only take 2 min to get to my house? Okay, I have to stop now because I'm really getting irked now."}
{"text":"The food tastes great. Customer service is usually good. The problem I have is not just with this location, but is something I've experienced at all locations. The claim that they deliver and that they're freaky fast is crap. Yes, they deliver. If you live less than a mile away. I'm two miles, so I'm out of luck. That rule is ridiculous. What is the point of delivering only to costumers within a mile? On top of that, if you happen to be at a place that is within a mile, they take forever to get your food to you. My old complex was literally one parking lot away from Jimmy Johns. I usually drove the 30 seconds to get a sandwhich, or walked the two minutes to their restaurant, but this time I was sick and didn't want to go out. I ordered. And waited. And waited. After an hour and a half I called. It wasn't because they hadn't received my order. It was because they hadn't gotten to me yet. This was at 3 in the afternoon. Lunch rush was over. 30 minutes later my sandwhich was delivered. It took two hours for them to make a sandwhich and drive 30 seconds to the complex next door.  I've also had JJs delivered to my work. I always had to order an hour before my lunch because even though I worked less than a mile away, the average delivery time was still an hour. That is not freaky fast service.  I would be perfectly okay waiting an hour for food if the company serviced people outside of a mile radius. Pizza places take about an hour. But they have to literally cook the food and they deliver to more people in a much wider radius. When you order pizza, you expect to wait an hour. When you order a sanwhich, you shouldn't have to.  Jimmy Johns makes a completely false claim that they are freaky fast. I've been a customer for years, in two states and five cities. I've never seen them be freaky fast. In my opinion, this is false advertising.  After years of being a slightly disappointed customer, I finally decided to write a review today because I've recently moved. There is a JJs right down the street. I decided to see if they delivered to me, but I was skeptical because I'm more than a mile out. So I called, and of course the answer was no. And the gentleman on the phone goes \"why don't you call a closer location.\" I thought this was kinda weird because why would I call a location that wasn't the closest and also, I'd just given him my address and cross streets, shouldn't he realize that he is my closest location? So I told him, \"I did. You are only two miles away. There isn't another location closer.\" And the gentleman says \"Oh, if we're that close, why don't you just come in then?\" And that was the last straw for this company. If I am willing to pay the company extra for delivery charge AND willing to tip the delivery person, why should it matter what my reason for wanting delivery is?  Keeping a delivery radius so tight just to claim you have freaky fast delivery is stupid. Especially if that claim is false. If the company was smart they would open their radius to a wider range of customers and drop the stupid slogan."}
{"text":"Happy that they opened a store near me. Sub and service is what you expect from Jimmy John's. Gave 4 star because of bad location. Difficult to see from Power Road."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time per a recommendation and the fact it was beside the pet store I needed to go to. Ordered the veggie aka mayo sub and was not impressed. White bread, tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, cheese, a tiny bit of avocado spread, and tons of mayo. 10 subs worth... Reminded me of subway, which I do not like either. Sorry JJ won't be back."}
{"text":"I first went to Jimmy Johns in downtown Chicago, then in a few other cities around the USA . .  I was overjoyed when they came to Arizona I found one in Mesa . .  but at Arrowhead only 7 minutes from my house!! HAPPY DAYS! . . . So on with a short review.       Yummy and Fast !! . . . They make sub sandwiches faster than I can run to get my drink. . . . Turn look, DONE!! Unlike Subway these sandwiches have plenty of meat!     Great place to take my kids, and lots of kitschy signs on the wall like : Your mouth isn't watering, it's crying for Jimmy Johns.  or Your mother wants you to eat more Jimmy Johns. Not in a stuck up way . . . just fun!       The staff is always so very upbeat . . it's like they would hang out here even if they weren't working. . .  They also wear cool T-shirts with sayings like \"Subs so fast you'll Freak! \"  . .  I'm not going to freak out . . but I am going back to Jimmy Johns as often as possible!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for sandwiches whenever I'm going back home.  Love their services, always fresh food .  tuna sandwich is my favorite, best breakfast ever!!!  Alll in all their fast , no matter what time.."}
{"text":"I could not be more thankful for these guys.  They handle large orders like true professionals.  Anthony, Victor, and Newcome were outstanding with costumer service.  I cannot thank these guys enough."}
{"text":"My second time ordering from this location. Just can't get enough of Jimmy john's and it's always tempting cause they're so close to me. I usually order the Pepe but ordered the slim 5 today and they gave it to me without the cheese :( So it just had the meat on it. I love my cheese so that was a bummer and probably won't order the slim 5 again."}
{"text":"Love love love this place ah food ah Amazing everything about it ah mAzing employees are supper nice"}
{"text":"Second time at this location.....freaky fast but they forgot all my requested ingredients! Unfortunately I left and had to return they refused to correct my sandwich.....All I wanted was for them to add onions and mustard! Doubt if I ever return to this location and will definitely tell my co-workers to go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches were delicious but service was lacking. I bought 5 subs with chips and cookies. The cashier handed me a bag and I was expected to bag all my stuff on my own. I realize that this sounds extremely petty but it just portrayed rude and lazy service in my opinion. I would expect a little more friendly assistance at a sub shop."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I never gave this place a try before until recently.    I'm from the East Coast so I am really picky about hoagies.  This place killed it!  They're just like the hoagies back home.  I love the Italian hoagie.  It's affordable too.  The employees are always friendly.  The location is in a sketchy part of town, so be cautious and alert."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is so fast, and with all that extra time I get back, I like to take my gold over to the \"i buy gold\" place right next door.  Terrible joke, sorry.  I dunno it's decent food, and they got crushed ice. My favorite order is a turkey tom with mustard. Check it out. :D"}
{"text":"Not freaky fast delivery, ordered a few times, takes over an hour."}
{"text":"I don't think they are the best sub shop but certainly the fastest. Food is good."}
{"text":"I ate a number 10 I had some tomatoes ends in my sandwich and it was quite salty I swear you could put this sandwich in freshwater it turn it into saltwater never again will I eat at this establishment."}
{"text":"Awesome service ! It's rare to walk in someplace and have every single worker say hello and welcome. Most places the workers don't even look up at you ! Such friendly and efficient employees. Very refreshing keep it up!"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's friendly staff kindly donated 300+ handcrafted sandwiches to our Freshmen Orientation at our high school.  Jeremy and Aisha cheerfully hauled all the sandwiches to our school, set up a tent and served sandwiches and menus to our incoming freshmen class of 1,000+ freshmen.  Even after donating all the sandwiches to our freshmen, they furthered their kindness by hosting a sandwich lunch for all of the high school faculty and staff.  They made a total of 3 trips back and forth to our school in the same day, not to mention all the time they took out of their day to work with us in planning the event.  We are eternally grateful for the kindness and enthusiasm we were showed and highly recommend EVERYONE to always enjoy their Jimmy John's from this location."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would.   Today the sweetest girl in the office received her sandwich wrong for the second time in a row. With mayo on it, so pretty much the only thing you can't just take off. She won't ever say anything but I will. Even though our office orders hundreds of dollars worth of food from this place each month, they refused to refund one $6.49 sandwich. The only option to resolve the situation was to bring another sandwich to her RIGHT NOW. I explained her lunch was now over and she wouldn't even be able to eat it. They would not agree bring it tomorrow or any other day.    Congratulations to Josh! You have lost our business. You could have refunded $6.49 or come up with a better resolution then just screwing her."}
{"text":"I'm just about done giving my business to this store. I have had two experiences now that go like this: I place my order, and it takes 4 minutes shy of an hour to get here. I live MAYBE 10 minutes away. Subs so fast you freak? Not there."}
{"text":"Disappointed that Jimmy John's skimps so much on the meat now compared to what they used to. My sandwich felt a little light walking out the door, and only found 2 slices of meat on my sub when I got home.....forced to have a second dinner. I think a handful of almonds would have been more filling. I'll pay for a sandwich that satisfies me, but won't be happy when I pay any price for one that make me hungrier."}
{"text":"This has always been my go to place when Im to busy to go get lunch!!! I just ordered and the Sandwich's went up 2$ per Sandwich and the chips went up .34 cents!!!! Thanks to Minimum wage??? Really!!  Last time going here!!!"}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is awesome.  You pretty much can't have a bad sandwich from this place.  You can literally walk into this place and walk out with your sandwich in 1 or 2 minutes as long as the line isn't ridiculous.  For downtowners this JJs is supremely located two doors down from the Steelyard Great Clips making it an unbeatable 1-2 Sunday afternoon punch  The main drawback is that there's a major snafu with the downtown (Euclid street) locaton.  The one on Euclid covers delivery for the downtown area, but they close at 7.  This location in Steelyard is open until 10 but still can't deliver down town...  what gives?  Do you hate revenue?  Even a 10 PM delivery is a far cry from what most are used to on University campuses (3 AM delivery) but it'd be a clearcut improvement."}
{"text":"Every time we go eat there, it is always amazing! The staff is always very friendly and they are super quick. If you are in a hurry for lunch, they will get you in and out quickly. Their delivery is very fast as well. You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"We use Jimmy Johns at my company to order lunch for the students when we have training classes. We never have had any complaints from the students and they always deliver on time, sometimes even a little early, which is fabulous. The staff is so friendly and gets everything right! If you want a great semi-inexpensive and fresh sandwich in the Henderson area, go to this Jimmy Johns. They are hands-down my favorite. :)"}
{"text":"Sometimes, nothing beats a good old fashioned sandwich. The bread was fresh the meats and cheeses were tasty, the veggies were crisp. Cannot wait to try another one. And the service WAS surprisingly fast."}
{"text":"This store just opened up near my work and I am super excited about it! Cheap, delicious and fast, this Jimmy John's is my new favorite lunch stop! I'm really happy that there is a sandwich place other than the overpriced deli across the way. I will be visiting this store many more times in the future!"}
{"text":"Last week I visited this location for the first time and I was very pleased with my experience. Extremely fast service; I was in and out in about 5 minutes. The staff were very friendly. As usual for JJ, the sandwiches were delicious! I will absolutely go back to this location when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Had Jimmy John's while I was in chicago and they were some of the best sandwiches I ever had, thought I'd try them out here. While the delivery was fast and free, the food we received was just awful. The bread was scooped out of our sandwiches when we specifically ordered it not to be, all that was there was basically crust, our sandwiches were missing ingredients, and lacked in what they actually remembered to put on. Waste of money, honestly. We will never be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This is my first time ordering at Jimmy John's, so this is only a first impression:  I ordered online for a late lunch (about 4 PM, so before the dinner rush) and delivery was pretty good- about 15 minutes. Since these places only deliver at a 2 mile radius and don't have to cook anything, it's pretty standard. I can imagine that their dinner rush deliveries would take longer.   I ordered the 8 inch Ham and Provolone (which comes with mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomato) but the only issue I have is that they put globs and globs of mayo on my sub, which, in all honesty, doesn't taste good considering the bread is plain and they use the minimum amount of meat.   I will say that the price is more than fair because: 8 inch sandwich Bag of JJ chips 20 oz bottle of coke Delivery fee  Comes to about $9.90, which is great. So with my tip, I paid 12 bucks.  I just think that the subs are pretty tasteless, unfortunately, I personally prefer Subway.  I will admit though, the delivery is faster than other places, the price is very fair, and the driver was very nice. It's just a shame the food isn't as great as everyone says. It's the only reason it gets 3 stars. What good is great service and prices without the taste?    I probably won't order here unless I am desperate to eat fast food, without having to walk to grab a bite to eat. Next time, I'll probably try wheat bread with a sub that has more meat on it. :)"}
{"text":"Most JJ are great. This one not so much. Crappy attitudes when you first hit the door, and they don't even come close to hitting the bar that most every franchise does. Little things like marking the order with a grease pen so you you don't have to tear through 5/6 sandwiches to sort out whose is whose. Also asked if they could deliver to a place of business and they said they couldn't for drivers safety. I think a public place of business is much safer than an address in the middle of nowhere as far as drivers safety is concerned. The lazy girl on the phone didn't feel like fooling around with my order so she dismissed my order."}
{"text":"They're not kidding about \"freaky fast delivery\"-- they don't mess around. I ordered my sandwich at noon, and they were at my door at 12:04. FOUR MINUTES! I barely had time to get my pants on! I was wide-eyed and gaping at the delivery guy. How do they do it????  As far as the sandwich goes, it's nothing to write home about. The bread is amazing, but what's inside the bread isn't all too exciting. I prefer Quizno's.  If I were just rating the sandwich, I'd give Jimmy John's a 4-star review. But because they are suspiciously fast with delivery, this place deserves all 5."}
{"text":"Clean, fast, friendly and great food to boot!  Even my kids love Jimmy John's.  The only issue is my house is 1/2 mile outside of the delivery radius.   Love the Beach Club, get you one!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome, but the service here is great. I asked about options for my girlfriend since she cant have bread, and they not only prepared a lettuce wrap but offered to sanitize the counter since bread was prepared on it. It wasnt necessary, but it was great for him to offer!"}
{"text":"Out of all the sandwich places, Jimmy John's is by far, my most favorite! The bread is always super good and the service is super quick and efficient. I'm always in and out in probably less than 5 minutes. I recommend #13, the bootlegger. It's my favorite and I never get anything else. I also love the jalapeño chips. It's super good. They also do an option of getting the sandwiches as lettuce wraps or \"unwiches\" which is super helpful if you're doing no carb or on a diet."}
{"text":"The first time I went in there I was baffled by the menu. I am used to the typical Subway experience where you're in a line, telling them condiment by condiment what you'd like. This place was different. Their menu already has a classic combination of ingredients stuffed into their bread.   So I ordered the #1 - Pepe (Ham & Provolone basically). While I was sure I would like the combination, but isn't a sandwich shop always about the bread? Well, that's my opinion. And I have to say, their bread is lacking in my opinion. It's that tough bread that can't really be that good unless you have steel teeth & an iron jaw to chew it with. I just don't dig chewy bread. The service was great. They immediately attended to me and took my order, but the food itself, I just wasn't impressed with the bread."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns. I have ate at everyone in Champaign. They rock and the speed is awesome!!!!!"}
{"text":"They messed my order up 2 times. But the sandwich was great as usual. I love my jimmy john sandwich."}
{"text":"I order from here at least a few times a week. Always fresh and it's true.. Freaky fast delivery!"}
{"text":"Drove there to pick up sandwiches for the office.  Got to the office and they got the order wrong.  Called to let them know and my secretary drove back over.  They acted like she was inconveniencing them, no \"We're sorry,\" let alone even an offer of a free bag of chips or a drink.  Disappointed.  Shows poor management, training, lack of true customer service."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were just like almost every other sub shop. The employees, with the exception of the cashier, were beyond obnoxious.I know some people appreciate being yelled \"HELLO!\" to be eight or so people all at once, but by the time the third customer after us walked in the door, we were over it. The sandwiches were just ok, the atmosphere was really annoying.  Two stars."}
{"text":"All of the employees at my work depend on JJ's for a quick and tasty meal....and when I say quick, I mean that they literally deliver about 10 minutes after ordering! The staff are always friendly & they have yet to make a mistake with the food. NO MUSS, NO FUSS!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the sandwiches here! You can also order pickles,whole,halved or quartered. LOVE! I usually order the beach club with the white roll type bread, which is ridiculously good on its own. Today I decided to have the wheat and it was even better. If you like a nutty whole grain thick slices. It was really great!!"}
{"text":"I seriously think they were screwing with me just to see if I would write this. Went through drive thru and ordered 3 different sandwiches and 2 bags of chips. Order was repeated verbatim back to me not once, but twice.   Two bags of chips on top- one plain and one salt and vinegar. I ordered 2 plain. Three sandwiches. 1 was not even close to what I ordered. One was a BLT on a hero instead of the wheat bread and the other was fine.  Topper- I looked at the receipt and not only was the receipt not what I ordered, the order was correct according to the receipt. So, the people making the food followed the ticket, but the person who took the order and repeated it back to me decided to push some new buttons leaving one person with no dinner and one with something he didn't really want. ..no one ate the salt and vinegar chips. But, I paid for all of it.  Yes, it was good, yes it was fast, but someone needs to tell all the 17-year olds working there to be a lot more polite and a little more careful. Yes, I would return again because I do like the food, but this particular place should improve customer service and throw in the smile to conform to a \"service with a smile\" sales tactic. Putting the cell phone away while you are giving me my total would be nice, too."}
{"text":"Terrible attitude behind the counter. Low quality sandwich when compared with Jersey Mikes or Subway. Very disappointed after first visit. The sandwich was not made with fresh meat and was floating in mayonnaise.. Cannot recommend this chain if this is typical of all locations. BACK TO JERSEY MIKES."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's just opened in Middleton.  I can't say that Middleton was lacking in sub places, but they're a welcome addition regardless.  As you would expect from a chain, this location does not differ at all from the other locations.  They have a reasonably-sized menu and you don't get many options in terms of customizing your sandwich.  So, if you're lucky enough to arrive when there are no other customers, your sandwich will be ready in about a minute.    Their subs are tasty but not out-of-this-world.  They never have any kind of special, limited-time subs, and the menu is very unadventurous (no \"Buffalo Chicken Bacon Chipotle Club Supreme!!!!\"), so if you went there every day you would be bored after two weeks.  If you're hungry, I recommend the Italian Night Club (probably the best chain Italian sub anywhere) or the Hunter's Club (not great-quality roast beef, but a lot of it).  If you're not very hungry (or, as my Mom says, you have a bird-like appetite), go for the JJBLT.    JJ's uses only Hellman's mayo, which, as far as I'm concerned, is the only mayo which is fit for human ingestion.  They also only use provolone cheese, which is actually saltier and less cheeselike than Subway's provolone.  So those two cancel each other out.  Normally I would give only three stars, but as this location seems friendlier and faster than other Jimmy Johnses, I awarded them an extra star.  I am normally do not appropriate stars in such a generous manner, but the situation warrants it.  Now I have to deal with the fact that when I went to Middleton High School, the only restaurants within walking distance were China Wok and Taco Johns (RIP in peace), while the spoiled brats these days get a JJ's and an entire organic grocery store.  Grrr."}
{"text":"Thank you Jimmy John's at 13875 N 83rd ave Peoria, AZ 85381 for giving me uncontrollable diarrhea after ordering my lunch from you today. My body is 42 years old and I've learned to get to know what makes me sick and what does not. I have eaten here at least 3 times (all the same sub). I can guarantee that the sandwich I ordered for lunch today kept me sitting on the toilet off and on since I got home from work. I can't believe I spent over $10.00 to sit on a shit a lung out. All I can say is NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT HERE!!!!!!! I will let my co-workers know if they want a fast weight loss, just order a sub here. Thank you for giving me the shits Jimmy John's!"}
{"text":"Very rude when I called, young girl asked me my cross streets 3 different times and each time I gave it to her, she asked for them again. I live less than 3 miles from their location and she tells me they can't deliver here.  Looks like no more Jimmy John's for me anymore.  If the young lady answering the phone had any intelligence and understanding how to talk to someone on the phone, I would have drove down there and picked it up, but she was so rude I will go someplace that has the desire to hire someone with intelligence and manners.  Just being real here."}
{"text":"Service sucks. And why is it called Gourmet? Subway is way better! Not coming back for sure"}
{"text":"Ordered Jimmy John's for lunch. Man! They are not \"freaky fast\" like they used to be.   So, I sign for my food 35 minutes after placing my order, which is substantially longer than normal. I pick up the bag and can immediately tell my bag of chips is not in the sandwich bag.  Me: \"There are supposed to be chips.\" Delivery guy: \"They should be in there.\"  *I open the bag and show him*  Me: \"Nope, not in there.\" DG: \"Do you want me to bring them back?\" Me: \"Well, yeah.\" DG: \"Okay, but it's gonna be a while.\"  An entire additional hour and the chips are finally delivered. Sadly this is not unusual and that's why I rarely order from JJ's. Oh, and it was a good thing I had my own straw because that was missing too.  I quit ordering from them because this happens so frequently to myself as well as my co-workers. Makes me wonder if the owner of this particular JJ's has them do this on purpose because they always ask if you want them to come back with chips. Of course you do, you paid for them.  And the fact that it took an additional hour is ridiculous. If you mess up an order it should be a priority to fix it quickly. This JJ's is 1 mile from my work. That shouldn't take an hour, especially on a Sunday when traffic is lighter.  For those that might wonder why I ordered from them again when I clearly have not been happy with service, it is only because it is a Sunday, I was working alone so I couldn't leave to pick up food and all the places I normally order lunch from are closed on Sundays.  Best believe I will be ordering pizza or making sure I bring a lunch with me in the future.  I will not be ordering or entering any Jimmy Johns establishment again."}
{"text":"Subs are always good and delivered quickly. The only issue that I have is some times there is a shortage of meat and they never remember straws when I order a drink, lol. And I mean never. Anyway, good stuff other than that. Straws!"}
{"text":"The amount of mayo they put on my sandwich made it inedible. It was truly one of the more disgusting sandwiches I've had. This was my first time at jimmy johns and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Totally bad costumer service I experienced for the second TIME!  I was charged a dollar extra for adding avocado spread on my sub and they didn't even put it on my sub so when I went to tell the worker what had happened he didn't even offered to return me my $1 which wasn't all that but also didn't even apologized to me for their mistake.  Their worker's are so rude I'm better off going to subway down the street instead."}
{"text":"Easily the best sub sandwich place in North Scottsdale.    Bread is generally quite fresh and the ingredients are flavorful. Typically I am very pleased with my order. A much better sub than the flavorless ones from Subway and a vastly superior experience to the stale bread and poor service at Jersey Mike's. Its really not even fair to mention those two in this review as Jimmy John's is vastly superior.  A big bonus is the delivery. Sandwiches are always delivered quickly.   I always wonder how the other sandwich shops are going to compete with the combination Jimmy John's has going on of good food, great service, low prices and fast delivery.  Well done Jimmy John's!"}
{"text":"So far I haven't had a bad experience at any Jimmy John's but this location is exceptional. Been in a few times & staff is very friendly. And of course, super fast. Only downside is you have to be very careful to tell them if you want an ingredient off the sub because they're almost too fast & we had one mistake, but it was no big deal."}
{"text":"I work at A Wild Hair and the staff at this location is so awesome always delivering sandwiches all day to us! They are awesome!"}
{"text":"The WORST customer service I have ever experienced!! They delivered the wrong sandwich to my office and when I called and asked if they could please deliver the correct sandwich I was redirected to every employee that works there for them to tell me it was my fault. After 10 minutes and finally speaking to the manager and then the owner they agreed to deliver my sandwich. I waited 30 minutes and finally called to see if it was on the way and the owner had the nerve to tell me I did not make it clear that I wanted a new sandwich. The owner delivered my sandwich to my office and was very rude and raised his voice at me saying \"next time you order you need to specify\" I am still in complete shock over my experience. I will NEVER order from them again."}
{"text":"i love jimmy johns!  they never fail me.  i am super picky about my sandwiches and they always get it right.  sometimes they make the sandwiches SO fast, they forget to cut my sandwich in half like i request.  my favorite sandwiches are the tuna and bootlegger.  and i LOVE their jalapeno chips.  yum-o!"}
{"text":"I signed up for Yelp today just to write about this location.    I have been there twice for lunch.  The music over the tiny space where orders are softly announced is far too loud.  On my 1st visit there were too many people milling around in the kitchen and too many customers huddled up waiting for their orders.  Service was glacial.  You cannot find a napkin or straw in the dining area.  Even if you buy a sandwich and a drink \"for here\", you would have to initiate the request for a napkin and straw. None were provided on either occasion as if most people never use them. Doesn't take a genius to leave them out on the counter or on the tables. Easy fix, is anyone listening?  I wrote feedback on the corporate website after the 1st visit but encountered a technical error where the message would not transmit.  After the 2nd disappointing visit, I tried the website again and was eventually able to transmit feedback. Have never received any response.  Why did I give them a 2nd chance?  The sandwiches are actually decent. What a shame  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I called for delivery. I live literally right past Fort Apache and they said they don't pass Fort Apache at all. Imagine putting your foot over the line and you're at your destination. They won't cross that line. That's too bad."}
{"text":"I go here often for lunch or order delivery to my office from this location, and while the experience in the store has been fine for me, the one delivery guy who always delivers everyone's food here is awful. He's extremely rude, loud and obnoxious. He went to the wrong address today and when I told him over the phone, he yelled, \"Are you kidding me?!\" among other complaints. Then, when I specialized in the special instructions to call me upon arrival, he did not and simply threw my food on my desk and walked out. My order also wasn't accurate -- my drink was wrong and he didn't give me a straw. I'm honestly going to start requesting in the special instructions that they don't send him when they deliver my food."}
{"text":"OK so its simple, just subs. No soups, No salads. I like the #1 Pepe.. The meats are fresh, so are the other fixins. This is a no fuss sandwich joint.   For those of you complaining, go spend $10-$12 for a \"real roast beef\" sandwich elsewhere. This is as good as it gets in the Tempe area or any area. Most places have frozen meats (Its a underground \"tube\" like restaurant) I'm referring to!   The chips are good, I like the BBQ ones. The bread is uber fresh. If you want the hassle eat elsewhere. When I'm hungry and want good fresh eats, JJ's is the place!   PS Jimmy John, Chandler could use one, either San Tan Village, Chandler Fashion Mall or at Gilbert Crossing at Gilbert & the 202 (san tan)"}
{"text":"Very delicious! This place is perfect for a quick lunch stop or a fast delivery. I have always been satisfied here. The bread is my favorite part and the cookies are always fresh! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Awesome staff. Extremely fast service.   Upon entering I was recognized almost immediately by a couple staff members and they made my sandwich (slim 5) so quickly that I had it at the register as I was paying. Talk about quick service! It was awesome."}
{"text":"14 employees in the joint when I showed up at 11:30am- I imagine they had delivery drivers out as well. When my party of 4 walked in we were the only patrons, and we received the traditional raucous welcome. In true JJ's fashion, I was practically thrown my sandwich nanoseconds after being handed back my credit card. Went with the #9 this time- it's going to be very hard to try anything else there with how good this was.   I head-faked toward the front door prior to using the men's room to see if I could trick them into a loud goodbye. It worked. I laughed, they didn't."}
{"text":"Just sitting outside waiting for my boyfriend and his friend to grab some food. I think it's awesome that I have seen two guys running to their cars delivering jimmy johns subs...they actually run. I think that's awesome!"}
{"text":"If they get your order wrong and have to remake it, they WILL use the same bread.  Example: sandwich contains mustard, so you ask them to remake it. They will simply use the same bread and scrape off the mustard.   Luckily I'm not allergic to mustard, otherwise that would be a lawsuit waiting to happen. At least the bread was fresh."}
{"text":"When I was 20/21 years old, every weekend around 2:30 AM I would stop in my local Milwaukee, WI Jimmy Johns for an after-party, sometimes choosing the \"we will deliver just one sandwich\" route to my downtown apartment, but always choosing Jimmy Johns.  I grew older, (22/23) and moved to Phoenix, AZ, and found my closest solution to getting my JJ fix was Tuscon, AZ. So occasionally when the cravings got so bad, I would drive down for a sub. Sometimes I would make a friend who lived 2 hours south of Tuscon stop on her way to Phoenix to get me one. One time, the craving was so bad I made a friend visiting from Milwaukee bring me one on the plane with her when she visited.  Now that I am old and gray,(25/26), Phoenix has decided to jump on board and add JJ to the valley.  13 pounds heavier and so much happier now that I have my Turkey Tom and my sexy Big John fix, the last piece to my puzzle will be when they put one by my workplace so I can get a sub delivered to me every day for lunch. FREAKISHLY FAST!(They are not lying. When a delivery department can deliver before you pass out getting home from the bar, you know it is fast)   Note: If you can not catch well, ask them to hand you your sub nicely. I have been hit when not on the up and up."}
{"text":"Terrific bread, great tasting sandwich!  Music was too loud to hold a conversation and the staff seem disinterested."}
{"text":"Great bread, quality meats, fresh toppings, and all at a reasonable price what more do you want."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and FAST service! They're done before you finish paying.   I've had the #12 Beach Club a couple of time and it really hits the spot. The only think a bit lacking is the potato chips selection. They have 3-4 choices."}
{"text":"I usually don't have issues with jimmy johns but this particular one has given me issues.  I'm a pretty reasonable person but they ticked me off today.  After waiting 1 hour for my order I called to check on my order and was told it was on its way.  After another hour I called back and was told my order was canceled, and then told that was incorrect.  I was placed on hold then I guess a manger was put on the line with no explanation of what was going on.  He very dryly told me the driver left with the order and didn't come back with it  need less to say I won't be ordering from here anytime soon"}
{"text":"Great service and great food.  Very clean and large space that supplies enough seating.  One thing that annoys me is that they never have napkins.  I couldn't seem to find any."}
{"text":"This place is so slow. Easily the slowest Jimmy johns I've ever been to. It seems very disorganized."}
{"text":"We love jimmy johns and have received nothing but the best in customer service!! The store is kept clean and we are always welcomed with a smile! Their delivery is also faster than ever expected!! If you love pickles this is where to get them! We even have had them call to follow up with how they did! We will forever be jimmy john fans and even love their bread free unwich options! Thank you st. Rose staff for going above and beyond every time!!! We will continue to order from you!"}
{"text":"Any other sandwich shop is \"freaky fast\" compared to this Jimmy John's.  I ordered two subs to go, the only special request I made was \"add jalapeños\" to one sandwich. There were only two people ahead of me line, and after waiting 5 minutes, I was informed they needed to make a new batch of tuna (why wouldn't they have a batch on hand, or have made a new batch before they completely ran out?!?). It took at least another 15 minutes to make the tuna. I left the shop highly stressed, because I was now running late. I became even more frustrated when my husband opened his sandwich and had NO jalapeños and NO lettuce (which should automatically come on the sandwich). I like Jimmy John's, but won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I Love Jimmy John's, always have. My trip to this Jimmy John's was my first to any since moving to Vegas back in November. It may not seem like much, but coming from a Michigan State campus Jimmy John's (and having 3 friends that worked there), needless to say I was there often. I know mistakes are made at times, if not often, at a busy franchise like JJ's. But forgetting a simple request -  like \"can I have peppers on my #12\" - when there is a 4-1 sandwich architect-to-customer ratio, is inexcusable.  It's not as if I won't return, because Jimmy John's is Jimmy John's, am I right? But come on. The request for 'Pep' was on the receipt, I paid for it, so show me the pep! Also, I overheard a \"No, it's a #15, not 16\" from the girl behind the counter - and rookie mistakes are excusable. No problem.  Next time, put a little pep in your step, get the order right, and I'll be back more often than not."}
{"text":"Order from here regularly and get consitently fast service and quality food"}
{"text":"Quick, efficient, and excellent customer service!  I order from them once and sometimes twice a week."}
{"text":"I am a busy man that needs instant gratification when it comes to lunch delivery.  This place gets the job done!  At other locations, I've accidentally had an ingredient added or chips forgotten... They always correct their wrong!  Whether it is running you what they had forgotten (5 minutes or less) or giving you a credit for the next time you order!  It's fast, fresh, convenient and I have never experienced any negative customer service.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Make sure to watch them make your sandwich. they put tomatoes on my sub 2 different times when i asked for none. Besides that, the delivery bikers/drivers are nice, and the subs are made quick if you walk in. sometimes too quick..."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!  The bread at this jj is always soft and delish compared to the other jj's in town.  Tip:  ask them to cut it in half so the meat doesn't slide out if the bread on every bite."}
{"text":"Welcome to Jimmy John's, the place where you can get a sandwich in your hand before you're done paying. I probably come here once a week, more or less, and haven't had any bad experiences. Still a cornerstone of the student diet, and great for a quick meal.   Is it a little bit overpriced for cold cuts, veggies, and bread? Probably. But when you're in between classes or rushing to catch a bus somewhere, it matters, and besides, you probably won't find much better for a $6 meal anyways. The bread tastes great, the lettuce is always crisp, and the balance between the meat, toppings, and mayonnaise is always spot-on."}
{"text":"Buyer beware and keep an eye on your charges at this location. I ordered a sandwich, making it a combo for \"$2.88\" more per the drive thru menu. When I got to the window the guy told me my total was $10.22 and I asked if he gave me the \"combo\" pricing because it seemed more than it should be, he said yes. I looked at the receipt and saw that they charged me $1.89 for the soda and $1.59 for the chips totaling $3.48. I went inside to explain that the menu says \"combo for $2.88 more\" and the gal behind the counter chose to argue with me telling me the combo only provides a .10 cent discount and I explained what they charged is .60 cents more than what the price should be.  She continued to challenge me and I told her this was false advertising and she should talk to a manager about it. She says, rudely, \"I am the manager, have a nice day.\" I know .60 cents isn't a lot but if you are feeding a large family it sure adds up. If this gal worked for my business and I found out she handled herself in this manner, she'd be gone!"}
{"text":"If you like sandwiches it hard to beat Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"Sandwich nazis. No kids options because a kid can't get a good sandwich by ordering a slim and don't even think about asking to add something to a slim. No baked chip option... no variation in size, no wraps. Only pros: delivery and lettuce wraps.  Annoying"}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience at TM next door and gave up on ever getting my food. Walked here, never been, and I should have gone here first. Everyone was happy and smiling, I got my food within a minute and they even wished me a nice day. Food isn't life changing, but I needed lunch and they definitely perked up my previously sour mood. You rock"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I had great plans to visit Jimmy Johns on our weekend trip to Vegas as LV locations were the closest we could find to our LA home. We instantly fell in love with the fresh gourmet sandwiches when we took our first bites on our trip to Chicago last year. To our disappointment, the first location we arrived at per our phone no longer existed while the second location we found was closed on Sundays! :( we called yet another location to find that they close at 5pm and it was already 4:55. However, the wonderful boyfriend called them back and asked if they could keep the doors open just until 5:10.  The staff agreed and we raced like maniacs to the third location!! We didn't arrive until 5:15 but the awesome staff waited for us & we were finally able get our Jimmy John's sandwich! The sandwiches were delicious as always - we were with another couple who tried it for the first time and they loved it! I knew the sandwiches would be good but the staffs' kindness in waiting for us made it amazing!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food is very good and accurate.  Staff was all business and bursting with energy. The manager, I think his name is bubbles, he looks like a short cute buddy holly, was friendly and and helpful."}
{"text":"Paid $9.13 for a .25c bag of chips .05c lrge cup that is very small. And a sub sandwich I ordered large that is small anywhere else. The sub was so little and easy to make it was finished before I could get my change.  I wont go back id rather pay $1 $2 nore and get a sub from capriottis or firehouse that is twice as big and takes more than a couple seconds to make.  The sub by the way tasted like ones you would buy prepared out of a 7-11  Bag of chips were really good though! That deserves a star I guess.."}
{"text":"Ordered A gourmet veggie club, with extra cucumbers, extra hot peppers, extra tomato, extra avocado. None of which I received. When I called they asked a few questions then transferred me to the manager, I explained to him I did not receive what I ordered. The manager did first mention he watched the person make my sandwich correctly, told me I was lying about my order being incorrect. Then he changed what he said into needing to watch the cameras and verify my complaint with the return of my sandwich. He was seemed angry and had a condescending tone. I didn't pursue the issue anymore, I was afraid that my remake sandwich would be sabotaged.  Poor Customer Service. I WILL NEVER REFER MY CLIENTS THERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"No stars, over an hour for my delivery!  so much for \"freaky fast\""}
{"text":"Check your order before you leave, got all the way home only to open the wrong order and I am a vegetarian so that was super disappointing.  Not my first choice of Jimmy Johns locations to go running back to."}
{"text":"Super fast and delightful service.   Very clean and accommodating.  The location is great I will be back."}
{"text":"Coustomer service was terrible.. the music was way too loud !!  Employes were yelling at the top of their lungs They could not get our order right if there job depended on it  worst sandwitch shop ive ever been too"}
{"text":"We like to get office lunches from here.  Wish they delivered to our area because we would order it more.  Staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"I will not order from this location again. I called them back last delivery because we had 2 sandwiches with burnt bread and they did nothing but justify why the bread was burnt! The management is clearly lacking customer service skills. Today I gave them another chance, they sent my order out for delivery before I was done completing it! I'm highly upset that not even a discount was offered it was changed full price and yet again justified that the Odets are out in 2 minutes. As a customer I want my order to be correct, not burnt and great customer service and I did not receive such things!"}
{"text":"Normally I would give them a 3 star rating which isn't great, but it's supposed to be a quick sandwich delivery place so you can't really expect too much. Today they weren't so quick. I placed my order at 4:27, and usually my sandwich would be at my door 15-20 minutes from the time I place the order at the most. When my sandwich hadn't arrived by 5:02, I figured I'd call and see if there was some sort of issue. The guy I spoke with(possibly the manager) said he only had one driver, but that it was weird that my order hadn't made it yet. I explained to him that if it was going to be much longer, he could go ahead and cancel the order. Once I told him that he said \"You're order is on the way out the door right now and you should have it in a few minutes\", which is weird since he just told me it should've already been delivered. Funny how that works. I figured ok, they're only 5 minutes from my house so at least it would be here soon. Once it had been an hour from when I originally placed my order, I decided that I had waited long enough and I was going to cancel the order. When I called back, I spoke to the same guy and told him that I had never had this issue with them before and that I would like to cancel my order. He said that was fine and to send the driver back with my order when he arrives. As he said that the driver knocked on my door and I told him that he had just got here. He told me to go ahead and send him back and if I paid with a credit card he would go ahead and cancel the charge. I told him it was going to be cash, but ok I'll send him back. Why wouldn't you just offer to not charge me and give it to me for free since he was here and I had been waiting for an hour since my original order. I would've given the driver whatever my charge would've been as a tip and you would've made both of us happy. Instead you'd rather waste the sandwich and leave the customer unhappy with the service you're supposed to be providing. I also found out from the driver that he was told to make another stop before coming to me, the customer who had been waiting for far too long. Like I said before, it's supposed to be a quick sandwich, so that's kind of what I expect. Instead I got some horrible customer service with no apologies and no attempt to make the situation right."}
{"text":"Maybe my definition of \"freaky fast\" is wrong because I waited for an hour for my food today. It's a Sunday at 430, well now 530, I'm not sure how the busy the store was but an hour is unacceptable for a delivery anywhere. If I would have known it would have taken that long I would have figured something else out. I did call and speak to the manager, Andrew, who's solution was to void the transaction and have the driver come back to pick up my food (assuming that wouldn't have taken an hour though). Needless to say, Jimmy Johns will never have my business again."}
{"text":"Only place in strongsville in can deliver food to my work as fast as they can love that when you don't know when and how long your break will be!"}
{"text":"This location has been GREAT to us until we tried placed our order the other day and they told we were outside their delivery area.  We have placed in excess of a dozen orders over the past few months.  We are 1.1 miles away?!?!?!?"}
{"text":"I work on the northeast corner of charleston & Durango, and love Jimmy Johns. This location is so inconsistent with delivering to my salon, most of the time they tell me they can only deliver to the southwest corner of Charleston & Durango. Only every once in a while do they actually go the extra 500 feet to deliver to me. It is so frustrating, and truly makes me want to never eat at Jimmy Johns again."}
{"text":"They make awesome subs for a good price.  I enjoy these a lot more than Subway (bland.) Also, they make the sandwiches very fast. I've been in and out of the store within two minutes before.   I always get the J.J. Gargantuan sub and it is the one with all the meat on it. Very good."}
{"text":"first time at this location, always loved jimmy johns, because its fast and delicious. This time not so much, go in, greated fairly not too bad, after they make the sandwiche, it was fast no complaint there, but then he handed it to me with no bag, and i didnt reallt care i was hungry and in a hurry to get home, but when i got home, and i took my first bite, it was then i realized the bread was as hard as a rock, like yesterday morning if not the day before that hard....half way through the sandwiche my jaw hurt, had to take off all the ingredients and put it on two slices of bread I had at home, it was HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"As a long time fam of Jimmy John's I was excited to see a location right across from where I get my nails done. I couldn't wait to get my nails finished so that I could grab a sub to take home. Upon entry the great music hit my ears & I bobbed my head to the beat. The man behind the counter greeted me with a 'hey girl!' & I'm immediately offended. When I do business ANYWHERE I expect to be addressed in a more professional manner. I corrected the man by telling him I'm not 'girl' I'm 'ma'am' to which he became visably annoyed.  He immediately started with the silent treatment & even put my change on the counter instead of in my hand. RUDE. CHILDISH.  I ordered the Vito & asked for it minus the onions. The young lady who made the sandwich began to hand the sandwich to me & then pulled it back saying she needed to make it over. Since I was in a hurry to end this unpleasant encounter, I asked what the problem was & she said she had mistakenly put onions on it. I took the sandwich & told her that I would pick them off. Little did I know that the sandwich was MOSTLY onion, very little meat, no cheese, & no dressing making for a very dry & smelly lunch.  Before leaving the store, I asked if there was a phone number of a manager or owner. She told me that the unprofessional man who addressed me as 'girl' was the manager. How very sad that he is the example that people who work there follow, as he seems to think that being 'cool' is more important than securing repeat business by being professional & getting orders right.  I won't be back for more disrespect & dry bread & onion sandwiches no matter how convenient it is.  PS - I want to be clear that I am writing about the location at 5469 S Rainbow. Here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars because I'm nice.  This was the worst jimmy johns I've ever been to. I order the beach club without cheese... They didn't put cheese but they also must have forgot the meat and they definitely forgot tomatoes... ridiculous. Paid 11.60 for lunch and wasted my money for sure."}
{"text":"Subs are good! I have been here multiple times and will continue to come back. My only complaint is that the counter help employees (males) are very rude and seem to be frustrated that your there to spend money and give them business."}
{"text":"I went to this location for lunch today. About 5 seconds after I walked in the door, one of the employees whistled at me. While I'm no prude, I don't care to be harassed by an employee of a business I'm patronizing. I turned around and walked out. The manager should really consider implementing a code of conduct with his/her employees."}
{"text":"Your standard Jimmy Johns.  They made your subs fast, empty your wallets even faster.  This place was great since last year I lived in PAR (worst dorm ever at the time) so it just was a quick walk/bike ride away.  I don't order much from here anymore with so many other options around, since I live pretty far away from Lincoln now, but if you're in the area and looking for some quick food, definitely the place to stop at."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday night around 6:00 PM. Food was great but employees were disgusting.   Of course I expected teenagers to be working at a sub shop on a Friday night but these teens were a different breed. The kid taking our order yawned without covering his mouth while entering our order into the register, he looked like he hadn't showered in months, had erratic facial hair,  and sat on an open trash can while taking the order. All of the kids acted completely un interested in making sure we had what we needed. They gave us someone else's sandwich and I wouldn't be surprised if he wrapped it back up and gave it to the correct person after I had already opened it and touched it.   As we left my dad (an older gentleman) decided to order a cookie, I headed out the door to wait outside. I watched as he paid and turned around to walk out the door. The kids pointed and laughed behind his back while mocking him as he walked away. It took everything inside of me not to walk back in and put them in their place. These kids need a lesson in respect."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Nowhere faster to get a great sandwich.  And they always get it right.  Don't for get to add hot peppers."}
{"text":"My food was ok.but the delivery guy had really nasty hand and finger nails were dirty.I work in fast food and a hospital  that is the number one thing wash your hands when dealing with food or anything that deals with customers.my bag was dirty too.I paid alot for my food I expect my food sanitary."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Their sandwiches are amazing. Finally decided to try their delivery and from the time I hit the submit button on the website they were delivering my sandwich in less than 5 minutes."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if possibly.  Their delivery is awful and they have a very horrible attitude about running late.  I ordered a delivery for 11:45-12:00 earlier in the morning. At 12:10 the order was still not hear and I was running late for a meeting. I called and was told he would be here any minute...that didn't happen.  Called  back at 12:20 and I was basically told, too bad so sad, he's busy but they'll cancel my order for me. At this point I'm now late for a meeting with no lunch..thanks a lot of the crappy attitude and service."}
{"text":"We ordered subs today for lunch.  They were very fast, food was here in less than 10 minutes.  My husband loved his sub, he got the Italian.  I ordered the turkey with added avocado and bacon.  My bread was hard and crusty, like maybe it was exposed to air too long.  Also there was barely any avocado on my sub, which is kind of ridiculous since I was charged $1 for it.  Despite that the sub was pretty tasty.  I also ordered a pickle, and it was fantastic!  Both subs and the pickle came to almost $20, a little pricey, but when stuck at home with a sick kid it is nice to get something delivered that isn't pizza.  Overall due to quickness, taste (I'm willing to believe the stale bun was a fluke), and that pickle we would definitely order again."}
{"text":"First time, ordered the turkey.  The sandwich was plain, cafeteria style.  The tomatoes were mushy and the turkey tasted like it had been refrigerated for a long time.  I only ate half of the sandwich before I couldn't stomach it anymore.  The staff was friendly, and they did get my order right.  However, the music was too loud."}
{"text":"Jimmy john's Mmm love there sandwich's only wish they could get your sandwich made the right way more then 3 outta 5 times"}
{"text":"So I called in an order about a month ago for a jjblt, dill pickle, and a drink. Took the driver over two hrs to arrive. He forgot my drink and my pickle. The boy felt really bad and apologized. I wasn't even mad at him, but I did call the store back to ask for a refund. Spoke to the manager Summer and she was really nice and apologized about the situation. She told me the next time I call in my meal would be free. At that point I had no harsh feelings towards that Jimmy Johns location. So a month went by and I remembered that free meal I was promised. Called the store and explained the situation to the worker on the phone, and he was rude and was not believing what I had told him. So I then spoke to the manager that was working at the time didn't catch his name, might have been jerry, but it was whichever manager was working the night shift on 4-11-15 . He was even more rude than the last guy I spoke too. He treated me like I was full of shit and was questioning me about the situation like I made whole damn thing up. Even when I told him every detail. He pulled up the original order and that date that I told him it was on annnnnd the manager I spoke to and it all matched up. This ass face still wasn't believing me. So I argued with him and  he eventually did the order for me. Hopefully nobody spit in my sandwich. And yes this was a small incident, but i wont let someone treat me like a liar. So yea im gonna spend 10 minutes to explain why you guys should fire r-tard. If your wondering why I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the first people I spoke to that were professional and not accusing me of being a fuckin liar. Whoever Mr dumb ass managers name was ruined the review for this location. Congratulations you suck at life and should go work at mickey d's as if working at jimmy Johns wasn't sad enough lmao :D thanks to all the other workers and the manager Sumer though! You guys are solid!"}
{"text":"Craving jimmy johns so we went to this location and the girl at the checkout was not enthusiastic like other people at their other locations. No one was there but she seemed annoyed. She didn't ask if I wanted cheese, which I did and was bummed out mine didn't have any. Then they just put the sandwiches on the counter. They were to go and we had 3 so she could have asked if we wanted them bagged. No I had to reach over the counter and do it my self."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 different kinds of sandwiches. The service was wonderful. The sandwiches were fresh, but they were all bland."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here a few times, but after tonight I won't again. I ordered 1 sandwich at 7:20. It finally arrives at 8:07 which is extremely long for JJ's, especially since my apartment is literally 0.4 miles down the road. I thought whatever, they're probably busy because it's Friday. When I went to eat the sandwich, it was SO soggy. The lettuce was wilted and in a clump. The sogginess of the sandwich totally ruined it. Never again will I pay $15 for a 6 inch sub that's soggy and disgusting."}
{"text":"Great subs, extremely quick service. I arrived one time with my son about an hour before they were scheduled to open and the only guy there came outside, invited us in, and made us subs."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the first two times were decent. I like their thin bread. But the last few times (4+) I've been here it's been very dirty. Every table has leftover food mess on it. The last time I was here it was so bad I asked a server to come wipe a table down. He did - but he didn't bother to clean the others while he was at it. They were still gross when I left.  Came back today and it's the same thing. If the hygiene is this bad out front I fear for what it's like where you can't see. I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"They're a sandwich shop with a sense of humor. Check the sign on the bathroom floor for an example. The bread is thinner than other sub places which I really like since I'm not a big bread fan. They also have an \"unwich\" that has no bread at all. Free refills and a fast assembly line for the food makes them a nice spot for a quick lunch.  The only thing about the place I'm not fond of is how loud the music is. It's pretty deafening. The line cooks one day were having to shout to be heard and two of them standing right next to each other said \"huh?\" and \"I can't hear you\" to one another so many times it was like being in a who's on first routine."}
{"text":"I love jimmy johns but almost everytime I come to this location they get something wrong. Today they gave me the wrong chips, other times they forget to give me straws. And one time they got my sandwich wrong."}
{"text":"Love this location. Go there almost everyday. Fast, delicious, and friendly in the fifteen seconds it takes for them to whip up something delicious."}
{"text":"I love JJ's! My husband and I have also been to this particular JJ's over 20+ times but today would be our last time.  My husband was attempting to order a sandwich but he wanted it in a wrap so the person taking his order had to adjust the check..they then told him that the wrap is a lettuce wrap not a tortilla wrap so he attempted to explain what he want while the \"manager/supervisor\" got frustrated/furious! He cut my husband off, rolled his eyes and proceeded to try and tell him \"what you got to do..\"  My husband asked him if he had a problem because he was rolling his eyes. The supervisor then told him to leave the store or he was going to call the cops! Are you freaking kidding me?!   Who does that? Shame on you Jimmy John's for hiring such an unprofessional and inconsiderate person!  We will miss you."}
{"text":"The lettuce and onions were paper thin, there was an excessive amount of lettuce. The avocado spread was extra and barely noticeable. The pickle was NOT completely quartered. I heard great radio commercials for Jimmy Johns, I am really disappointed. The delivery person was courteous and polite. The food was delivered in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Visited this location yesterday 5/16, I ordered a tuna lettuce wrap with the works. When lunch time rolls around, I take a healthy bite of my wrap and what do I find???  NO TUNA!!!!"}
{"text":"I thought they were a little skimpy on the amount of meat they put on my club sandwich,  otherwise it was okay."}
{"text":"Finally broke down and went here. Hate buying sandwiches (I can make them at home) they do not have the ability to toast the bread so I went with a lettuce wrap. I did not want cheese, since they only have one kind of cheese. Provolone. The kid that checked us out was SO rude. The sandwich was ok but nothing special. Not sure I will go back."}
{"text":"I've always loved JImmy Johns, but this is the best one ever. I ordered my food and had it in my hands 9 minutes later. That is freaky fast. Plus they're always super nice. Awesome."}
{"text":"After ordering from here and receiving great service I have to say I'm disappointed with my most recent experience. My sandwich was wrong, I said no mayo and got mayo. Another thing is I have a 30 minute lunch break. I ordered 10 minutes before I went to lunch and I got my sandwich 10 minutes before my lunch was over. Well, looks like I need to find somewhere else that delivers."}
{"text":"I ordered online this morning @ 11:37 A.M hoping to get a quick meal during my lunch hour. I've ordered several times from Jimmy John's and have never been disappointed. However, this time, I NEVER GOT MY FOOD. So much for freaky fast. After 30 minutes of waiting I called and was told that they were short staffed, and had back to back walk ins, and there wasn't much she could do about it, AND I can just void my order. She said if I REALLY wanted my food she'd have it out to me in 5 to 10 minutes, if that. I had faith and waited. 30 minutes later, NOTHING. I even called back and was placed on hold for 7 minutes. A co worker of mine called while I was holding and we finally got a hold of someone who voided my order. Not gonna be putting my trust back in that place again. Neither will any of my co workers.  A courtesy call or a heads up would have been nice. I didn't even have time to go somewhere else so I ate nothing."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service and attitude from manager, Jessica at this location. We placed a home delivery order and waited...and waited. Called to inquire and we're told we had been called and we were out of the delivery range. We were not called! They had called a different number. We asked to complete our order, since it had been almost 2 hours, she refused to comp anything and said, again, they had called us!! Jessica was rude and refused to admit they had made a mistake! She has no business being in the hospitality business! What a jerk....."}
{"text":"We are waiting for results of lab tests to confirm food poisoning from this store. A family member has been very, very sick. Be very careful about eating anything from this location, especially if your sandwich has raw veggies on it.  There have been outbreaks of E Coli at several of their stores over the last few years; google it."}
{"text":"First time at a Jimmy Johns; My son ordered a sandwich on Saturday around 12:30p. First, the place is tiny and so poorly laid out that it is difficult to know what to do first.  Do I get in line like at Subway, then pay? But the registers are up front. Ah, order and pay at the register.  I paid cash and no receipt was provided. Now you get in the single file line in front of the 3 staff making sandwiches. The line dead ends into the back of the store, where you also find the soda machine. There is only room for a single file line, so good luck getting out after your order is ready, or getting to the soda machine if you want a refill.   Now the fun part...30 minutes of waiting and still no sandwich.  Guess it didn't dawn on the staff that my son standing at the end of the line for 30 minutes was waiting on something. I had walked away from the store to look for something more appetizing; after returning expecting to see my son sitting and eating, I  said something to the clueless staff. They said 'What did he have'? We told them, and they said \"oh, someone must have picked that up\"...as if it is not their fault they did not deliver my son's order to him. Since by now there was no one else waiting on a sandwich, they \"rushed\" it and made it.  Apparently, it takes 7 staff to make 6 sandwiches in 15 minutes.  The store did not smell good either, surprising since they have their \"free smells\" sign proudly lit.  You know how a bag of subs smells the next day?  That's what this tiny little store smells like...not fresh.  Luckily there are many other choices for food at Desert Ridge, including sandwiches at at least 4 other places including next door to this JJ."}
{"text":"This company treats it's employees really poorly.  Employees are required to come in and work when they're sick, so there's an increased chance of becoming ill if you eat at Jimmy John's.  It's worth your time to research this company's history of mistreating the people who make it a success."}
{"text":"Great sub for the price!!  Did I mention they deliver??"}
{"text":"Great sandwich and a friendly staff!  I like to order the Italian \"Un-which.\" So yummy! Make sure you get it with extra lettuce and extra peppers. You won't be disappointed. Order a pickle to top off a quick healthy meal!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love Jimmy John's.  This location is a joke.  Almost every time I've been here they screw up my order, not to mention it is the slowest Jimmy Johns I have ever visited.  The  meat and cheese is half off the bread and they also don't deliver to half of Lakewood.  Today the workers had their friends in the store and were yelling back and forth to each other while working.  I love Jimmy Johns, so I still have to go here, but I wish they would fix the service/staff at this location."}
{"text":"This location is directly next to my condo complex and I only frequent it due to convenience and laziness. If you have time to go somewhere else, please heed my warning and do!!!!  Today was the 4th time in a row of going there that my simple order was screwed up. A turkey sub hold the cucumbers add sprouts came out as a turkey sandwich without lettuce, tomatoes, sprouts or cheese; which I didn't see until I unwrapped it at home. Basically it was just meat on a bun!  Normally I just drive back to the drive thru and politely have them correct it, but today I was fed up and went inside. Sandwich was slammed on the counter and I asked the manager how difficult the job of preparing a sub with the order slip directly in front of you was. I let her know this was the 4 th time in a row of them screwing up my order. She rectified the situation and even reimbursed me for my sub which I didn't ask for.  My frustration level had finally peaked. After reading some of the other reviews, this seems to be an ongoing problem!  Also, it took me 11 mins to get through the drive thru with only one car in front of me because two of the workers had their heads out the window flirting with the girl in the car in front of me after she had paid and received her food. No shame!  This place needs a new staff and management that knows how to keep them in line and run a successful location."}
{"text":"Had a club tuna sandwich. It had a huge amount of onion, which was disgusting. Subway is so much better. Avoid."}
{"text":"I placed a large order prior to their opening and the assistant manager said the order would be done shortly after 10:30.  Order was complete at 11:35.  I called the manager to voice my concern and he said \"If you want to inconvenience another store with a large order, please do so\".  Freaky fast...sorry, a large order is an inconvenience and the manager is rude as hell.  Looking at their other reviews, my 1-star review is commensurate with the 17 other 1-star reviews.  I personally won't  order from this location ever again and I can assure you Monday morning I will have a discussion with corporate.    Not very accommodating and as an assistant manager, she should have said, sorry, but an order this large is an inconvenience to the store.  I would appreciate that you take your $300.87 an spend it at another Jimmy Johns.  All the Best JJ!"}
{"text":"Went once,  took one bite and got my money back right there and then. I would never go back. Portions are miserly to say the least. I asked for tomatoes on my eight inch sub and they gave me two tomatoes slices the size of a half dollar.  I paid 75 cents for a scoop of avocado puree the size of a quarter. When I told them the ingredients were skimped on,  the head shift person told me they get that complaint on a regular basis.   If I wanted a piece of bread with a slice of meat on it I could have done that at home. My money was refunded right away."}
{"text":"Great customer service - guy who runs the register is always helpful. Crew who makes the sandwiches always get my order right, even if I change my mind halfway through them making it. Place is always clean, bathrooms always clean, service is always good and sandwiches are always freaky fast!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the drive thru but went inside to order food and it took fifteen minutes to get the damn sandwich.  Slowest jimmy johns I've ever been to.  Then I got my sandwich to find no hot peppers or mustard and I asked for extra!  What the fuck. This place sucks honestly. Go to a different jimmy johns."}
{"text":"Love the food at this place but they screwed up my order, told me I didn't order hot peppers when that's really one of the only reasons I go to jimmy johns. They said they'd send another sub over took over thirty minutes when the original sub took fifteen minutes. Freaky fast subs my ass. College avenue johns is way smoother and more reliable."}
{"text":"Love this place, Great subs and incredibly fast delivery. I usually order 2 to 3 times a week. Although if you napkins would be nice with the delivery."}
{"text":"I order for delivery durning like 6pm they came less then 20 min it was fast the mobile. Site to order it from was kinda hard and took longer order then it took to deliver it I felt like it"}
{"text":"I went to Jimmy Johns with my 1 year old son. While ordering, I asked if my tomatoes could be placed on the side for my son. He is a picky eater but loves tomatoes. The young man at the cash register told me that I could just scrape them off the sandwich and that he had nothing to put them on the side with. I pointed at the complimentary water cups and asked if he could use one of those. He told me that he was the manager and that his boss told him that he could not do that. Are you kidding? Your boss told you that you could not accommodate a toddler?? I wasn't asking for anything other than an item from my sandwich to be placed on the side. Needless to say I will not be returning to this establishment any time soon."}
{"text":"Fast and always delicious. We were so pleased when a location opened near us because of hectic schedules we can get a healthy fast meal."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but the only thing this place has going for it is \"free smells\"!   My husband and I came here this past weekend for lunch.  He ordered the Italian whatever they call it and I got the turkey. His sandwich was fine but my turkey was -in my opinion- slimy. I can't stand turkey sandwich meat this way and it's exactly why I don't go to Subway.   I'd rather spend a little extra and go to Dilly's or Rinaldi's."}
{"text":"I've NEVER experienced WORSE customer service than I have at this JJ location.  I work close by and order food several times a week for delivery, as well as my other co-workers. Last week my order was an hour late, so I called to check up. After arguing with the manager that I never received my food (he claimed it was delivered and I might be trying to get my meal for free, RUDE) he discovered the delivery driver gave it to a random person near the location of my work. Thinking this is crazy, and still hungry, I was hoping for an apology or something taken off my bill since my food was given away. NOPE the manager Chaz, laughter it off, never apologized, and was unwilling to send my proof of void of payment since I no longer wanted the food. I will NEVER be returning to this location, and neither will my coworkers. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE"}
{"text":"I have given these guys so many chances and yet they seem to have the same problem EVERYTIME .....I wait 45 mins average for a damn sandwich to be delivered. ..don't market yourselves \"freaky fast\" if you can't live up to the name."}
{"text":"I LOVE Jimmy Johns however this location is absolutely HORRIBLE! Do not expect your ordered food to show up!   I ordered a sandwich and received a call 15 minutes later saying they were short on drivers and it would be 30 minutes. I was polite and let them know that would be fine. Over an hour later when my sandwich still hadn't been delivered I called the store and asked about the order. The manager told me they put the sandwich in the fridge to keep it cold and the delivery guy could not find the sandwich so they voided the order. They offered to deliver the sandwich and provide a full refund for the order. I let them know my disappointment and agreed. After that point it took another 45 minutes to receive my order. Over all it took 2 hours. NEVER ordering from this Jimmy Johns again."}
{"text":"Not impressed, loud atmosphere, bland overpriced sandwiches. 10 employees behind the counter and no clean tables. How many people does it take to make a sandwich? More like the employees are just here to hang out with each other than work."}
{"text":"Love this JIMMY JOHNS. Come here when I want a subway-like fix. Try the Country Club. They have decent seating, but a little tight. They have some funny inspirational signs too."}
{"text":"I have had three consecutive bad experiences with this location. The first time I went in to buy a sandwich, I was unaware that you could get a pickle with your meal instead of a bag of chips of cookie. I thought the pickle was extra on the side. I ordered my sandwich with a bag of chips and waited for it to be made. Only while I was waiting did I notice that I could order a pickle with my meal. I got back in line and waited and asked the lady behind the counter if I could just put my chips back on the rack and have a pickle with my sandwich, since it would not make a difference price wise. She looked at me like I was speaking another language and had to ask someone else if that was ok, to which he replied \"yea just give her a pickle.\" she wrapped up the pickle and took it down to the end of the line to put it with my sandwich. A girl there had been bagging all the other sandwiches, but the lady who had rung up my order took my sandwich from her and handed it to me. When I asked for a bag she replied \"They're right there.\" and walked away. I had to reach over the counter to get a bag. I had also asked for mustard packets which she did not give me.  I did not file a complaint at this time because I just thought, maybe she is having a bad day. The second time I went in, I had placed my order online before coming in. I had asked for no tomatoes and no alfalfa sprouts on my sandwich. When I sat down to eat my sandwich, I noticed that there was some tomato guts and seeds and some alfalfa sprouts mixed with the lettuce. It looked like they put those things on my sandwich and then scrapped them off once they realized their mistake. Since this was a different problem than the first one, I still did not want to file a complaint. Maybe the person making my sandwich was new.. who knows.  The third time I ordered my sandwich over the phone. I work at a business in the same shopping center as this Jimmy John's. They claim \"freaky fast delivery\". I got my sandwich 40 minutes after I placed my order. I was not able to eat my sandwich until about 3 hours later because our store had become very busy . When I sat down to eat my sandwich, I realized that had given me the wrong sandwich. The receipt on the bag was correct, but the sandwich was a completely different sandwich than what I had ordered. I called at 5:30 to replace my order. I told the man on the phone my story, he apologized and said my sandwich would be there shortly. At 6:10, my sandwich still had not arrived. I called back and asked to speak to the manager. He said one of his drivers had been in a car accident and that's why it was taking so long. He said my sandwich was in the car and on it's way. at 6:30 my sandwich still had not been delivered. I was off at 7:00. I called back the manager and told him to just keep the sandwich, I didn't want it anymore, and I wanted a refund. he refunded me the money and told me I would have a free meal next time I came in. However, I don't think there will be a next time. My sandwich was finally delivered to my work at 6:50, and hour and twenty minutes after I originally replaced my order.   The quality of food is great. The sandwiches are delicious, but the customer service at this location is way below even mediocre. The sandwiches, while pretty tasty, are not worth the hassle and rudeness."}
{"text":"I was just introduced to Jimmy Johns and love it I go to the Chandler one  at the mall and its fast and delicious. I love it so much I found the closest one to my house which is on Bell. My wife and I are from the east coast and never had JJ so I told her she had to try it because I knew she would love it. The bread is perfection it holds together with a little chew and soft inside, the meats are what really impress me the smoked ham is ridiculously amazing and the turkey is great. The only complain is they missed the onions on my sub but its so good I forgive them. Don't forget to try their BBQ chips they are good too. I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Only giving them a 2 star because I have received good service and good sandwiches in store.  However,  I have had poor service when ordering by phone.  Living in Spanish Trail, 1.5 miles from the store, I can't get delivery anymore.   I used to.  Not sure what changed.  I've had 1 Manager say I could get delivery but another say no.  Sad cuz I do love me some Jimmy John's"}
{"text":"What a lot of people in the reviews don't mention is the role that Jimmy John's fills in a college town like Kent. JJ's is open until 4am on the weekends. The only other restaurants in the city still open after 10pm are insomnia cookies and Tbell.   Most of my trips to Jimmy Johns were after late night study sessions or work shifts when I was exhausted and hungry. The staff and I both know what we're here for. I have a short exchange with them consisting of mostly grunting and pointing. I wait 2 minutes or less while extremely loud music plays, both keeping me awake and making me want to leave faster. Then I'm on my way home to eat the certainly edible food as quickly as possible so I can pass out.   Also, it's no secret that there is a lot of drinking on the weekends in Kent. JJ's delivery option keeps drunk students off the road and it's quicker than ordering a pizza.   It's not great food, but it does fill an important niche that is sorely lacking in options in Kent."}
{"text":"Horrible! Placed a delivery order after an hour called to find out they missed placed my order.  Funny they charged my credit card and got their money but couldn't deliver 2 sandwiches.  Hire more competent people Jimmy Johns!"}
{"text":"I am very impressed with this Jimmy Jones!  The staff is always friendly and attentive.  I always ask for particular attention to the condiments! The sandwiches are delicious and the rolls so fresh.  I am pleased to witness continued hand washing, the application of gloves, and attention to overalls cleanliness.  Particular for me, they do not play loud rock music!  The environment is very relaxed and comfortable."}
{"text":"Just left this Sub Shop 6:40...,The sandwiches were great with fresh bread and meat.  I think they have the Best potato chips too BUT:  Our main concern was the continuous, loud, twangy guitar music.  When we asked to if she could change the music, the employee suggested we move our seats.  We were the only people there and quite settled in our booth with sandwiches half consumed and a bag of open chips.  Hardly possible to gather our food and move!  Then she said she was not scheduled to work yet!!  Please young lady, we are the customers, and it does appear you need more customers!  We will find another location where the customers are respected and if a person wears the company uniform they will assist the customer if they  arrive early, leave  late or on a break!"}
{"text":"Always delicious! Just so busy and it's awkwardly designed, so waiting for your food sucks... which is why it gets 4, you can't hear your number or the orders being called, other then that.. food is perfection!"}
{"text":"Worst jimmy johns I've ever been to. As I was ordering my food the guy employee was texting on there phone the whole time. Even texting while he was giving me my change back not even looking me in the eye. The girl employee was making my sub. I asked her for no tomato or onions and I come home and there were extra on the sub. The worst customer service I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Don't try to order delivery if you life more than 2 miles outside of jurisdiction.  I live 2.4, yes, 2.4 miles away and was told that they could not deliver to me and on top of that the guy who informed me of this was rude and hung up on me! HUNG UP on me!  Customer serivce: FAIL.  Considering their subs are just ok, I was attempting to order from them to avoid going out of the house...now, I will drive myself to Subway and opt out of ever using Jimmy Johns again."}
{"text":"First time at a Jimmy John's, Great food but the girl at the counter Veronica, I believe, was NOT friendly! I walked up and said, \"sorry this is my first time here.\" So I order the country club & she looks at me with this look, like I'm stupid! She says, \"I don't know what that is, we order by number.\" Ok, I understand but they do not have a million sandwiches, so she should know the different sandwiches & numbers! The girl standing next to her says, \"I think it's number 11. Terrible customer service! She was not pleasant at all & had no expression on her face at all!"}
{"text":"Does anyone know why their regular subs are $1 more than all the other Jimmy John's? Or is that just when it's delivered, instead of charging a standard delivery fee? I've noticed that with the other types of sandwiches too, and extras...the slim is $4 instead of $3.25, and extra avo is $1.75 instead of $0.75  That's not going to stop me from ordering though :-) Still love their sandwiches...they make the best veggie sub I've had. They load it up with veggies, whereas I have to ask for extra everything at a certain other sub chain and then they still barely put any on. I'd much rather pay a little bit extra for Jimmy John's :-)"}
{"text":"Upgrade of a poorboy sandwhich. For the Garganiuan is was $7.50 and was about 6 inches long. tasted like lunch meat. $5 @ subway or $8 @ Capriottis would have been better choices. The staff was outstanding. There were like 8 people working in the small sandwhich shop? I would rather the money spent went into the food instead of extra staffing."}
{"text":"What!?!??! a jimmy johns on my street.. here in sunny Arizona!?! Finally a sub shop that I can eat at again. Love this place, its a staple in my diet.  Motha fuckin Beach Club, No cuc's, add hot peppers, on whole wheat.  YEAH!"}
{"text":"Their menu is not as big as Subways but the sandwiches that they do have is really good. I ordered the Turkey Tom with lettuce, tomato, mayo, sprouts & avacodo spread for dollar more. Their website is super easy to order from and I got to pick what time I wanted my food to be delivered and they brought it to my office on the dot."}
{"text":"Food is great, but the staff here is very rude. They don't respect their customers."}
{"text":"I've never been to a place where customer service was horrible.  The employees and managers are downright rude. Maybe its the location? But people who work for a livng like to eat too. A customer ordered his food and yes his attire was not the cleanest. But, you can tell he had been working. When his food was ready to be picked up, a female employee asked him, \"Dont you know that you need to clean up"}
{"text":"Very slow, and didn't announce when my sandwich was done...just let it sit there. Overall, badly staffed."}
{"text":"Great service.  Super fast! Number 16 add cucumbers,  onions, oregano, salt pepper, oil and vinegar."}
{"text":"Re-ordered same sandwich...they put the cheese in but didn't cut in half as requested. Again, good sandwich and delivery is quick, but someone that can read needs to review the order before it gets bagged and sent out."}
{"text":"Totally agree with the person below who said they started skimping on meat! Wow what happened???  When they first opened on 32nd St and E Bell Rd I was so excited, very happy they delivered!  I soon learned that my happiness was short lived by wrong orders, rude people answering the phone and overall bad management. I will say I have had such horrid service there that  The district manager called and apologized and offered a free meal. He was very sincere and I appreciated that but to bad the staff at the store don't have same attitude and I never took him up on it. I refuse to subject myself to snotty sand which makers that treat you demeaning when they mess up. Never will I spend a penny there again. Very sad cause its so close but I will take the drive to jersey mikes where they are friendly and make a darn good sand which!"}
{"text":"Never been more disappointed with an experience. After being delivered my \"freaky fast\" freakin wrong order, the staff precedes to make me aware that the ticket was right and my request wasn't properly documented. I guess \"customer is always right\" is lost with these clowns. Then sadly, they asked for the wrong sandwich back!!! Like I'm trying to steal a 4dollar sub. Shame on you Jimmy!!!!"}
{"text":"These are my favorite subs anywhere.  The sandwiches are all well made, extremely quick, have the best meats but most of all the bread is amazing. The staff at this location were all very nice and accommodating. Great place. It's a once a weeker for me"}
{"text":"Wow! Rude un-helpful borderline abrasive... not sure who is training the 2 staff that I came into contact with but it needs attention.  How can you make a bad, bland turkey sandwich? I will not stop in here again"}
{"text":"Loved this location up until now. How is it when you call to order that they have your number on file, know the address you are calling from but tell you that they do not deliver to your area. But even to get to this person on the phone who just said he could not deliver, had to go thru 2 other people . Super disappointed. . Lost loyal customers"}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's, but this location I would strongly advise against making a delivery order. I would say that at least 50% of the time my order is incorrect. I used to live closer to the Chandler Mall location and my order was always spot on. The food is still good, as long as you don't mind getting something different than you paid for."}
{"text":"The sandwich overall was not terrible. The bread on the other  hand was doughy and really flavorless. With the sandwich options out there, I think I'll continue going elsewhere."}
{"text":"They do not offer their dressing (oil) on the side. I inquired as to why and was told that \"their corporate policy does not allow it and that the stores don't have cups\". I inquired as to why and was told by the manager that they don't believe in putting things on the side. They also do not give you a bag to put your sandwich in when ordering in the drive thru. The drive thru attendant did not even thank me for my business. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I am not sure what the hype is all about.  I ordered a Beach and received cold hard bread and the most tasteless sandwich I have ever had.  My husband thought his sandwich was very bland as well and asked for some salt and pepper only to be told they do not have any.  Also the service is lacking in my opinion.  They said hello when we walked in and thank you when we left but in between the service was sub-par.  I felt like I was annoying the cashier when I ordered my sandwich.  Then I seemed to annoy her more when I asked if there was a drink chip combo....The guy who told my husband that they don't have salt and pepper lacked customer service skills in a big way.  If you want fast this is the place for you...but if you want anything else like good food or good customer service I suggest you take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN. So I was here the other day and I ordered a sandwich that had two different kinds of meat on it (#5 Vito). Instead of salami, I wanted turkey. Pretty simple right? Take one meat away and add a different one. When she told me the total it seemed about $2 too high. When I looked at the reciept I noticed they charged me $2 for the turkey? Wait...I took one meat away and subbed turkey...there's a charge for that?!?! Apparently so. I'm not sure I understand the philosphoy behind this, but I don't agree with it and I'll never eat there again. Only makes sense that if you take one meat away you should be able to sub another for no additional charge.  I was told that their sandwiches are made a certain way to assure speed and accuracy. Does reaching down into the turkey bin instead of the salami bin really affect speed that much? Come on!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I justoved in down the street and don't have much food in our fridge. We decided to offer some Jimmy John's. They've change their online ordering. But still easy to use. The delivery want as fast as I was expecting from previous experiences. It took nearly 30 minutes. Thats not exactly freaky fast in my book. Thats just a regular delivery time.  As far as the food good, it was good. I got the beach club and added bacon, which I won't do again. The bacon was way too salty for my liking."}
{"text":"This place makes the best, fastest sub-sandwiches in town.  Their delivery is super-fast if you live within the city of Kent.  I have went many weeks where I ordered Jimmy John's every single workday."}
{"text":"I cannot express how much I love this place! I was so happy they started opening them up in Arizona and now just opened up a location close to my work. Does life get any better?  I rarely leave my desk, either I bring my lunch or order out.  I can submit my order online and they are literally walking into my office 9 minutes later! I time them every time and its always 9 minutes!! Delivery guys are always super friendly as well.  I am from Milwaukee, Wisconsin and we had JJ's on our college campus. This was our Sunday morning hangover cure every weekend!"}
{"text":"Most mediocre sub I've ever eaten. Limited options for toppings. Much prefer subway where you can ask for whatever topping you like as you go through the line.  I went back with my sandwich to ask if they had salt and pepper. \"No, sorry.\" I honestly thought she was kidding. Won't be back. How this got to be a major chain is beyond me."}
{"text":"It's the second time I've eaten at JJs. The first time they got my order wrong. They gave my sandwich to someone else. So, TWO customers got the wrong sandwich. GM took care of me after I complained.  The second time I ordered, VERRRRYYY carefully. Made sure they got it right. They did. Sandwich was good. Probably go back.   On my drive out I witnessed the car in front of me almost T-boned and then I almost T-boned THAT reckless driver! Well? It was a JJs driver. Driver did not stop and just sped off, thinking I would just leave. Well, I followed back to where I just had my lunch. The driver was a young female. She was surprised by my going back. I was not going to confront her but go to the manager. He was disinterested and unapologetic about it.I called the GM from my last complaint. He was apologetic and concerned. SHE was a huge liability for JJs. No ownership was taken for her actions by her or the manager.  I will NOT be going back to that location. The Subway I go to is always pleasant and I never have to fear for my life."}
{"text":"Always good, fast, and fair priced.  A good sandwich value and several choices.  Just wish the music was a bit lower so a conversation can be had at the table."}
{"text":"No more sprouts for the veggie subs, no substitutions or extra veggies in place of sprouts.  :o(  Still yummy and fast."}
{"text":"We came for a breakfast sandwich, which they don't have.  But the sandwiches we ordered were great and I love the bread.  The staff was very polite and fast."}
{"text":"This location will always have a special place in my heart. When I lived right off of Ash, they would deliver so quickly and remembered without hesitation where I lived. Food never disappointed. Outside of this location, the quality of the sandwiches are pretty uniform, delicious. Italian nightclub is the greatest. Hot peppers on the side."}
{"text":"The last three times I've ordered from this store it had taken over an hour and a half to receive our food. No apology for any of the deliveries. The latest time the food and bag smelled thickly of cigarette smoke. AVOID this location."}
{"text":"Coming here a few times I quickly learned that this is one of the smaller JImmy John and you should most likely pick up your food and eat somewhere else. The employees were mediocre and so was the sandwich. Not being able to eat pork made ordering a sub pretty hard. Their is a very small selection of only turkey subs, which I hate about the place. I feel that if they included more turkey subs, they would be able to have more business. The place also was pretty packed when I arrived so my friends and I could sit and eat their unless we wanted to wait their for another 20 minutes. Anyways I enojoy the subs their I just wish they had a larger selection of turkey subs and more seating for the customers."}
{"text":"Subs not-so-freaky-fast.....The sandwiches always taste fine, but many times the staff are too busy chatting with one another and it seems to take them forever to make a slim 1 (its only ham and cheese)!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at jimmy John's and not to say my last but I was not blown away . The workers were very energetic and eager to help me decide. I would have liked a hot sandwich but I was at the wrong place for that, I ended up getting the #14 bootlegger.  It came out fast and I ate inside. The sandwich was good but nothing really made it special. I could have made the same thing at home ."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today, these guys don't joke around when they say freaky fast.  They handed me my sandwich before i even paid for it.  Bathrooms made me laugh.  Cute gal managing that place too... i'd readily eat honey nut cheetios out of phillip seymore hoffman's crusty asshole just for a chance to hold her hand.  Oh yeah, salt n vinegar chips were good too."}
{"text":"Adequate sandwiches with too little meat. The rolls are really good though. If you double up on the meat, then you have a good sub. A better bet is Jersey Mike's or firehouse subs. They don't slack on the meats and their rolls are just as good."}
{"text":"Wifey loves this spot. She gets the #10 hunters club add avocado.  I go with the gargantuan.  Sandwhich is good. We don't have them in sj so we make sure to stop here before we fly home."}
{"text":"Won't deliver 1.4 miles away... Are you kidding me? They messed up my order and then wouldn't deliver the correct sandwich 1.4 miles away! Not impressed at all!! This is the only location that I have ever had this experience with, but really??"}
{"text":"Staying a few minutes away from this locations for a convention and called to get a few sandwiches delivered. I only had about an hour and fifteen minute break to eat but thought that would be plenty of time.  I called after about 40 minutes of waiting, they said \"oh yeah, we have those made, we will get them right out to you\". I waited another 25 minutes or so before I had to go back into a session. Finally got a call after about an hour and a half but unfortunately couldn't answer and wouldn't have had time to eat them anyways. I looked at my credit card bill online a few hours later and was charged for the sandwiches. I called and asked for the manager, he seemed a little reluctant but eventually did reimburse me. We were just out of luck for lunch that day."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. I have yet to receive my sandwich the wrong way, and the delivery guys are always quick to bike across town. They've definitely got the best sandwich for the price range. Try #8 with hot peppers!"}
{"text":"I was very dissapointed with jimmy johns. They have a small menu. Then after you order you have to stand by the counter and wait for your order to be called out through the very loud ACDC music playing. I was given my sub without napkins and it was not cut in half. Lastly it was very difficult to eat due to the skinny sub roll and the over stuffing of fixings."}
{"text":"I ordered online, my husband got the bootlegger sandwich (no tomatoes, with cheese, with peppers) , and I got the Italian Club (no tomatoes, with peppers and light oil and vinegar). It was $15.50 with delivery but the sandwiches were very good and fresh."}
{"text":"A franchise, but it stands well above the rest. No burgers or hotdogs here, but freshly made hearty sandwiches  in either French bread or wheat loaf. There is also a choice of wrap, or an \"unwich\", i.e. without the bread. Large selection of fresh toppings other than BLT. The place is immaculately clean. There is another one of this in Oakland on Forbes."}
{"text":"Every time I've been there it's been a pleasant experience. However,  I went on Saturday & got the cheaper of the Italian subs (I'm not cheap. But I'm not paying over a dollar for a piece of ham. Maybe if it was Boars head). Anyway, I asked for light mayo & the young lady repeated that. Sadly, she put A LOT of mayo on it. Honestly if I had said \"extra mayo\", she would have had to use a shovel to put it on. I'm not exaggerating. Her version of light mayo was 2 or 3 scoops (or whatever that utensil is that they use ) full of mayo. Not to mention the bread was hard. Then, once my sandwich was finished, she stood there with it in her hand talking to a co-worker about 3 feet from me. All while waving it around while I stood there waiting for it. Since I don't consider this a \"bad\" experience,  but rather a learning experience  (the light mayo issue ) I will go back again. It's reasonably priced, fast, & like most people would agree, better than Subway. Just make sure that if/when you want a \"custom\" order that you pay attention. (Remember. They got sued in a class action law suit & lost. For misleading & then over charging customers)"}
{"text":"I have no idea what makes their veggie sandwiches better than anyone else's but it's the only thing I order when we stop at Jimmy John's!  They are so tasty!!  They are known for being 'fast'  .. and it's no hype ... my sandwich is usually done by the time I'm done paying!  We are also fans of their low-fat chips .. they don't taste 'low fat' but I'm going with it!"}
{"text":"I go here and get delivery a lot.  While parking isn't the easiest, the food is always good, the staff are friendly, and the delivery is quick."}
{"text":"This is the best place to grab a sandwich after a tough workout. This place is fast too so you don't have to wait around like you would at a subway. Much better quality ingredients too. Try the Vito and the Beach club. I've never had any complaints about the workers and they always seemed friendly to me and greet me on my way in and out. I will be back for more subs."}
{"text":"I like the Vito and the Tuna sandwich. Both sandwiches are very good and so is the bread. When we are busy at the office, we can call Jimmy John's and they deliver most of the time quickly. Two days ago the delivery surprisingly took one hour. That is the only time it took that long. Normally,  the delivery is in less than 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Just have to say I use Jimmy John deliveries all across the states for work travel and this is the most unaccomadating Jimmy Johns I have ever come across.  I am staying at a hotel literally less than half a mile away and was told they don't deliver here.    Terrible service.  How can you be less than half a mile away and not be able to deliver?!  Don't use this Jimmy Johns since they can't be troubled to go out of their way for loyal customers.   Don't spend your hard earned dollars with them."}
{"text":"When they say fast delivery they mean it!  I ordered online & about 5 mins later my food was at the door! So crazy to me lol I was thinking something had to be missing or something is wrong but no. Everything was there, correct & delicious. It is nice to have an alternative to the typical delivery foods (i.e pizza, thai, Chinese)    I will absolutely order from them again.   Their totally tuna is very fresh & a favorite of mine.   Also tried the beach club & was very happy with that selection.   Their cookies are pretty amazing too.   Did I mention how fast they deliver lol"}
{"text":"The guy that took my order gave terrible customer service. He seemed annoyed that we came in to order. He asked what did I want with an attitude. He didn't give me my receipt and handed me my order with out thanking me. They had a whole hour and fifteen minutes before closing so I don't understand the attitude. When I told him this was the worst customer service I received he didn't apologize. He gave me a dirty look. I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Everytime I order I can expect it to be 1 hour or more for delivery. Managers have no idea where their delivery people are. Delivery people can't even delivery to the right place WITH directions and the address I give them.  By the time the food comes it's not fresh and good anymore. Don't waste your time at this location."}
{"text":"I love this place  always fresh and the service is awSome ... I love the #13 carb free rapped in lettuce low calorie and super healthy"}
{"text":"I have ordered many times from multiple Jimmy Johns around town and my co-workers also do. The last three times I have ordered from this location, they have botched the order. Today was the last time I will order from them. I placed my order for delivery. I ordered a country club with no tomatoes, a bag a chips and a coke. The delivery guy handed me a bag with two sandwiches ( again, I only ordered one ). One of the sandwiches was correct to my order, the other was not. I explained to the driver what happened and he asked me to call the store. As I explained to Robin ( who was very cordial and identified herself as the manager) she asked me to return the receipts and they would refund my money and it would take 2-3 days. I asked how am I to know that it will be refunded and how I would prove the purchase without a receipt. Reluctantly I sent the receipt back with the driver and eventually received a call back from Robin. She said that due to the way their system is set up, they had to refund the entire amount but would need to place another charge of the amount that should have been charged. So now, they want to charge me again before my money is secured back to my account ( putting me out a total of over $30 until 2-3 days from now) because of a mistake they made. I informed her that I would never again order from that location and would pass this information on to my co-workers. Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"The food was good.  THE SERVICE HORRIBLE.  They need to teach their staff to be friendly and Smile. Don't try going there to get yourself and friends food alone.  They don't have drink carriers and when I asked for extra bags for my drinks the young man rolled his eyes at me.  I'll go to the other next time."}
{"text":"It was so horrible I don't know where to start!  My husband and I ordered two subs for delivery, and the delivery kid later called us complaining that our house was too hard to find, and whining about being lost (we live barely 10 minutes down the road from the Hudson Drive location).  Strike one for poor customer service.  The kid eventually showed up and left his car right in the middle of the road (!?) as he delivered the subs, and was once again rude and full of teenage snarkiness, complaining to us again, this time about how our house was too far outside of their delivery area, when it is in fact not (we had checked on the phone before ordering to see if we were in their delivery area and they said yes).  Strike two for poor customer service.  We ignored the delivery boy's attitude and went on to eating the subs.  I have had Jimmy John's subs before from one of their North Canton locations, and had loved them, but this sub was very soggy and unappetizing.  Very disappointing compared to the subs I've had from the other location.  Strike three, for poor food quality.  Three strikes and y'er out!"}
{"text":"Convenience of delivery, but mediocrity in quality. Why won't they put yellow mustard on for me? Okay, give me the packets, but this is now the third time that they forgot to include the packets. Thanks for cutting my sandwich in two, but why is one slice of bread broken into three pieces?"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is probably my favorite place for quick subs in Madison/Middleton. They are unbelievably quick, and their sandwiches are good as well. The prices are decent, too.  Of course you're not going to be given a gourmet sandwich, but from what you expect, the product is great."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's, especially when it is so close to my work. The ingredients are always fresh and the bread is just amazing. Add all that together with insanely fast service and you can't go wrong.   I would recommend the Ultimate Porker or Club LuLu."}
{"text":"Always good food with a clean environment- this location always seems to have good music and extremely helpful staff."}
{"text":"Another wrong order 1st time when I order delivery at work they took too long and my lunch break was over by the time they arrived 2nd time went in to order 2 sandwiches to go once we got home realize they gave us the wrong one ........I love the sandwiches but be careful with orders !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Italian night club was gross. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Balance of sandwich tasted like onions and mayo mushed between two slabs of so-so bread.   Loud music.  Staff was somewhat brusque.  I find Subway far better."}
{"text":"Really nice folks! Sandwich was good, but what I loved was the kindness. One woman behind the counter heard me say my car had broken down outside the store (dead battery). I tried to buy water, and she said, \"you're having a bad day, it's on me!\" It was an unexpected kindness, and because of it, I'll be a regular customer!"}
{"text":"I first visited a Jimmy Johns during a trip to Minnesota about 4 years ago, I had been drinking that night and we ended up sitting in a Jimmy Johns scarfing down a couple subs! Now fast forward  to today....I knew that they had opened a few stores out here and I just had to go, But I was a bit hesitant because of the fact that when I ate there 4 years ago I was in fact inebriated and anything would have tasted good at that point! So anyways the hubby and I visited the mall today and we passed by a Jimmy Johns on the way in and I knew we had to go, We walked in and there were about 6 employees with smiles on their faces and every single one of them greeted us.....kinda made me giggle a little :) I looked at the menu board on the wall searching for the same sub I had on my first visit, all I could remember was that it was turkey and it had alfalfa sprouts on it....searching.....searching ahhhh there it is! The Turkey Tom! A delish sub with turkey,sprouts,lettuce,tomato and mayo I added provolone cheese to mine. Also I made it a meal with a soda and a huge pickle......yes I said pickle! Not only are the pickles yummy but fun to make your husband jealous with!lol you can get the other usual sides also.The size of the subs are nice 8 inches to be exact and they have really good french bread,you can also buy just the bread which is always a plus! Upon leaving all of the employees once again told us goodbye, I really have nothing bad to say about this place I really enjoyed the food,service,and cleanliness :) I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and hmmm how do I say this......I'll be back! Yeah thats right I just went terminator all over this biotch! lol that was lame sorry!"}
{"text":"Place is just a Jimmy Johns with no seating inside. It's more of a Jimmy Johns express. I would not recommend ordering online from them however. I ordered online and never received a confirmation email. I called the store and the manager told me he couldn't find my order number. Figured it would be a no biggie situation where he would send my order to me anyway. We went back and forth as he said he wouldn't send the food without proof. I had to drive down to the store and show my bank statement that I was charged to get my food. It was  slightly annoying but he made it up to me with load of free cookies. Like 7 free cookies. If you haven't had JJ cookies they are...gross. But its the thought that counted there. If you like JJ, you'll probably like this!"}
{"text":"Yummy Sandwiches...and it is so much fun jumping in the car with our bag of sandwiches from JJ's and having my hubby say: \"That really was FREAKY fast.\"  Every.single.time!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed.  Never ordered from them before. While they were very expeditious in delivering, the sandwich was terrible. Brown shredded lettuce all over my tuna sandwich so it was mixed into the tuna. Can't believe they had the audacity to use such poor quality produce  . Would NOT recommend. Firehouse subs port of subs much better, unfortunately they don't deliver."}
{"text":"Fastest delivery ever and they don't mind delivering orders as small as 7 bucks it's awesome being able to get good affordable food delivered right to my house the last 2 times they've been here literally within 10 mins of me ordering online i can't believe how fast"}
{"text":"Jimmy johns did an excellent job as usual. Excellent customer service and the best sandwiches ever made by the one and only Tamika!! This location is under new management and it totally shows! Can't wait to come back again!!"}
{"text":"Was walking home from work and stubbed my toe on the curb -- looked up and saw Jimmy Johns -- Had to have a sub.  The bread is so moist it dissolves in your mouth -- I barely had to swallow because it was so liquefied. The bread just trickled down my throat in a slow, satisfying stream of yeast. I'm not usually a pickle person, but -- WOW! I later dreamed of their zesty tartness and biting acidity. The crunch was just right. Ordered the Ultimate Porker and felt that the meat was sliced just right, and salted to perfection -- big, satisfying hunks of pig glided into my mouth with ease.  Trace mold on my cheese, but this didn't bother me despite the mild vomiting that ocurred. The sandwich tasted better coming up and made room for seconds. All in all, I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This if my favorite JJ's in town. Staff always on top of their game. I usually stop in on my way to work at least once. With limited time before I have to clock in they normally have me in and out within 90 seconds. I also live about a mile away. Once I ordered for delivery on a -15 January afternoon. Not only was my food at my house in 9 minutes but also delivered on a bicycle. Thats some hardcore s**t right there. Keep it up JJ's!"}
{"text":"Literally could not even PAY to add oil and vinegar to my sub. The only explanation I was given was \"NO, it's a weird thing we can't. No you can't pay extra for it.\" Called corporate customer service to see why this oil and vinegar was so unattainable and I was accused of \"looking for a freebie.\" Not sure what that oil and vinegar is made out of but it seems like it's hidden in some temple for Indiana Jones to find. Well Jersey Mike's it is!"}
{"text":"2 out of 3 times i have called in an order to be picked up, the sand which was not only ready after 15minutes but not even entered into their system. Getting old"}
{"text":"Went in on customer service day. I have not been since we got bad bread about 4 months ago.For a dollar I thought I would give it one more try. NOT they said they did not honor customer service day and as I look at other reviews I guess they never did !"}
{"text":"Jimmy john is one of my favorite place to grab but after tonight it went down hill. I ordered a vegetarian sandwich and took it home once I got home it had ham and what not. It was the worst sandwich I ever got!!!! I called and they said I'd have to go drive back to get the sandwich I wanted in the first place. This is dumb and very annoying.  So to warning to all customers check ur order before going home."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  Me and my mom just got done moving.. and they came to our door within 15 minutes of us ordering online! Excellently!:)"}
{"text":"This place is a joke I ordered 2 sandwiches an hour later still no sandwiches I called back thy said thy were waiting for a driver my sandwiches were sitting on the counter for 45min. I canceled my order next time I'll call Jason's deli"}
{"text":"I'm 1.8mi away and the and the crybabies would not deliver to bad I went to firehouse sub instead"}
{"text":"Delivery was fantastic quick and delicious I'm so glad there delivery area has been expanded to Ann rd"}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns, but not this location.  When I arrived a little after 5pm, there was one other customer in the restaurant. It took about 10 minutes to get my sub, and as you may know, that is a very long time for a Jimmy Johns. They also messed up my order and put so much mayo on the sub that the bottom of the bread was slathered. I won't be returning to this location. I recommend the one on Charleston Blvd."}
{"text":"Best Jimmy Johns in the valley! Friendly staff, delicious and fast subs. I will return!"}
{"text":"Dirtiest Jimmy John's i've ever been to. At 2pm the tables were still filthy. Service was decent, but nowhere clean to enjoy my meal. Will definitetly walk out and find a cleaner place to eat next time."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 sandwiches, chips and a pickle; order came to be about $50. Soooo disappointed. Our sandwiches were mostly lettuce. I ordered a #4, a turkey tom. I got 2 slices of what I think was turkey and 1/2 pound of lettuce. The other sandwiches we ordered were made the same way. $50 for iceberg and bread?! I don't think so....Never again."}
{"text":"This place is great if you like ordering food and then getting at least one part of your order wrong every single time! I wouldn't bother coming to this location if it wasn't so close."}
{"text":"NOT freaky fast. Lunch never showed and never even tried calling me. When I called they were \"oh well\" about it. Now I have follow up to see if my money was properly refunded. Not going to or using this location. However they will be \"oh well\" about my business too"}
{"text":"Yet another horrible experience. 7 grain bread was soggy and undercooked. A few weeks ago the tuna was missing from the sandwich. And it's only this location."}
{"text":"Awesome subs, cheap, fast, and open till 4am? Yes please. Jimmy Johns is my favorite sub place in the valley. I'm really happy the are opening so many of them here. Any when your really hungry, the gargantuan is sure to satisfy!"}
{"text":"RIDICULOUS!!! My daughter is on a strict gluten free diet. I tried to order extra meat with my sandwich and I was willing to pay for it. But they wouldn't give it to me on the side. They said they HAD to put it on the sandwich, NO EXCEPTIONS! I explained that I didn't want the meat to touch the bread bc she is highly allergic. But she wouldn't budge and ruled with an iron fist. Makes no sense! The manager was very rude about the situation even though my daughter has a severe allergy to gluten! She wouldn't even try to accommodate me. She rudely pointed to the picture of the corporate executive up on the wall and said \"talk to him about it.\" I give the manager"}
{"text":"Excellent!  The food was wonderful and the workers even asked if there was anything they could do for us (i.e. is the music too loud, can I get you anything else, etc)."}
{"text":"Went there with my family, placed an order for over $30.00. One of the girls wrote the wrong number on the sub and acted like it was my fault. Went back to the counter to buy something else and another girl at the counter acted like I was bothering her. Very bad customer service. I get treated a lot better at subway. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"The customer service here is horrible. Who ever is running this place needs to get fired.  Had a long day at umc I bought a sandwich I'm on crutches and my phone was dead.  I got no help all I wanted was to call a cab.  Didn't even let me barrow the phone.  It was dead no one in the place.  They sent me to 711 I was treated like I was homeless."}
{"text":"Store 367 worse service in the world. I will never go back there again. This is the first time coming to Jimmy Johns and the cashier acted like I was bothering him when I placed my order and asked questions. They need to teach there employees the meaning of customer service. Don't go there unless you don't mind being treated like crap."}
{"text":"The SLOWEST jimmy johns ever! Every time I ordered a sub from this location it took 45+ to receive my order."}
{"text":"Great subs! Whole family loves them.  But I just realized they charge 25% delivery fee.  Are you kidding me?  Next time we'll drive to Cousins or Subway instead.  Freaky fast; Yes.  Freaky ridiculous delivery fee too!"}
{"text":"This is a brand new location and it's in a pretty convenient location.  We stopped in for one of my favorite sandwiches (the Vito) and we were not let down.  The music that was playing was just as awesome as the sandwich. After trying numerous sandwich joints, Jimmy Johns is by far my favorite.  I would totally pick Jimmy Johns over the likes of Subway- Give em' a try!"}
{"text":"I have always liked Jimmy Johns but this location is the WORST!  Waited 2 and 1/2 hours the first time I ordered delivery.  I had to call twice.    Ok - so maybe they had a bad day.  Today, I ordered again.  It took over an hour.  They are a block away!  And no napkins.  Ugh."}
{"text":"I walked in w my own cup and filled it w water from the fountain. Then tried to order a sandwich, the cashier rang up $1.99 for a drink and I told her that it was water. She said it didn't matter, she still needed to charge me for it. I told her that the state law required free water to anyone that asked. She said only if we give you the cup! Umm... what kind of sense does that make? If anything I would be saving the company $ from using my own cup. So I asked her for one of the Jimmy johns water cups, poured my water into it and left. What a ridiculous policy. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"OMG! I can't believe they opened a JJ's in Tempe!! I was so thrilled to see it while driving on Mill. This place used to be my fav spot when I was in Charleston, IL for high school.  So I had to stop to just get the taste of home that I missed for so long (since 2005), and decided to order my usual, the Turkey Tom. The sandwich was simple, bread was soft, and ingredients were fresh!!! I just felt healthier than eating burger and fries. (btw, the Pepe is really good too!)  Will definitely keep going back :)"}
{"text":"I've been to a few Jimmy John sub places. This particular one is really nice because it's in the corner of a plaza near nearby Costcos. The outside is really nice this time of the year. Their subs are pretty big and the prices in their price there. I wish the parking was a little bit better it's almost impossible to find a parking spot during lunch hours. I would have given it 5 Stars if those better parking but it is what it is."}
{"text":"Only deliver in a 2 mile radius?? Called to see if they would deliver to Brown and Recker and apparently it's too far... When I used to live in Tempe they would deliver way further. I'm sure this location isn't as busy as the Tempe ones so don't understand why they limit to a 2 mile radius"}
{"text":"I have always loved JJ's and experienced no issues. However, the first (and only) time I ordered from this location, the delivery took over 30 minutes and when I called in to ask about it, the guy told me it was \"on the road\" then hung up on me. Looks like I'll be going to Milio's from now on."}
{"text":"I would vote lower but this was a first time experience for me at this jimmy johns.  Normally my order is right and theres no problems. Today i had a problem i ordered a number 8 with no mustard no tomato or lettuce.  Just mayo meat and cheese when the girl who handed out the sandwich told me that i got a number 8 with extra lettuce i said \"no i asked for no lettuce tomato or mustard\" she said that thatsbwhats on the ticket. I responded again that i didnt order it this way so she offered to take the lettuce off for me, i think hey shes gonna use a knife or something She decided to use her fingers for some odd reason (they were gloved) just looking at her do that put me off so i just calmly told her nevermind i wouldnt eat it anyways and left. I didnt ask for my money back, i didnt want it. I was too grossed out by her and her fingers in my sandwich like that. I go to the bartending school around the corner from this place and I really liked the place but this lady ruined it for me im never going back"}
{"text":"Horrible food . The worst service. My order was wrong . Who puts wheat bread on Italian . The bread was soggy. Meat greasy. Never go back."}
{"text":"love JJ's. Probably been to JJ's 100 times in the last 3 yrs. do the math, that's pretty often. Today made me rethink my commitment  to JJ's sandwiches. Ordered a unwich. It was very bad. Wilted & \"rusty\" lettuce. Tried to swap it for a fresh one & they were very insulted by my request. They asked for the original back which I was happy to return.  I'm fairly certain they swapped out the \"insides\" to a new piece of lettuce. I just had higher expectations for my favorite sandwich place. They are normally very accommodating. Kind of a bummer."}
{"text":"Listen to all of you cattle leaving rave reviews for a generic sub.   \"Consistent!\"   \"Amazing!\"   \"Deliciousness!\"  More like \"atrociousness\". Jimmy John's nationwide seems to deliver a fairly tasty product if you have low standards, are hungover, or desperate for something halfway edible in a pinch. However, The Concord, North Carolina Jimmy John's at 1225 Concord Parkway, is more like a Factory of Sadness rather than a place to get a Factory Sub. Within two weeks, they screwed up THREE subs on two total orders. For the first order, there was less meat on two subs than there should have been. Period. We know what Jimmy John's subs of shame are supposed to look like. \"Consistent!\", right? Not really. When I called to inform them, the girl responded to me like I had just told her that her mother is a prostitute, her father isn't really her father, and that she is from Israel, not America. She freaked. It was strange. So after I listened to her attempting to tell me that I was wrong and she was right, I received two free subs, albeit reluctantly. So then when we decided to cash in our two free factory subs (I can't believe we did it but we did), they screwed our order up again. We asked for \"extra hot peppers, and if you need to charge us, then charge us, because when we say extra hot peppers, we would like more than 5.\" I don't know what \"a normal amount of hot peppers is\" for these Concord sub-making-trashers, 2 or 3 per sub? Are these peppers made of gold? Are they an expensive and rare pepper that can only be found in select Jimmy John's Nationwide? Are the sub makers secretly hoarding all the peppers for themselves and thus, attempt to share as little as possible with the friendly, paying customer? Maybe these peppers have special powers and the Concord Jimmy John's doesn't want us to find out. Regardless, we emphasized \"extra hot peppers\", and then we got home, and there are no f'ing peppers on the entire sub. Not.One.Pepper.  So, either the low-class individual making the subs is special needs, completely blazed, or is just a lazy turd with such low motivation that you can't even get paid to listen to english-speaking people and make their sandwich correctly. Needless to say, if you want your consistency, your deliciousness, your amazing subs, then go support someone in downtown Concord using real ingredients and real food prepared by real people.   We called to inform the Jimmy John's today of their recurrent failings, and, shockingly the guy who we spoke to gave zero S$%^'s about it, which means the manager is a lazy piece of trash as well, and now we all have clearly learned that everyone that works there treats the customer like a homeless person with smallpox holding a stick of lit dynamite and a sign that says \"kill all babies\". They are \"consistent!\" at one thing - Ruining your meal.  Needless to say, I will never, ever even consider supporting this establishment, and you've probably lost us as customers for life. The next time I walk into this Jimmy John's will be to use the restroom after eating at Subway."}
{"text":"Eff this place. Today I was nearly hit 3 different time within a 20 min time span because both drivers we in such a rush. One failed to stop at a stop sign, nearly hitting me in a cross walk outside my work. The other two times happened in the shop's complex where I was trying to back out of a space (my car being more than half way out and very obvious I was still backing out) and two different delivery drivers were in just such a rush they felt they should just go around.   Speed may be the key for your delivery service, but nearly being hit with a car that has your business name on it is very poor customer service."}
{"text":"This location is super quick! I placed the order and about the time I was putting my change back in my wallet the 2 sandwiches were ready! WOW. I've never received a sandwich quicker.  The sandwiches are packed with meat and have fresh toppings. The bread is also good, nice and soft and not soggy."}
{"text":"I ordered the italian sandwich a couple days ago, the bread was hard although everything else seemed fine. The chips were good, the servers were friendly and i will probably be back to give them another shot."}
{"text":"Who wouldn't love this place?? The weather is crap so we order Jimmy Johns. Order it at 1:39...he rings my bell at 1:50. Needless to say the food is great. From ordering to receiving its an all around good experience."}
{"text":"Crappy, rude, unhelpful!!!! These guys working here suck!!! I ordered a large amount of food online for our office. There was no where online to select sides or request cherry peppers and when I went to pick up the food I asked the guy behind the counter for some cherry peppers and was told they don't have anything to put them in, I suggested wrapping them up in the sandwich paper and was told they can't let them leave like that. Then the cashier told me if I asked him nicer then they might of given me peppers. The people working at this place are the WORST EVER!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. I get my food in like 5mins. for a delivery. Everyone is always perky, even that guy who rides a bike [*eco-friendly love it*]."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but it wasn't to be. Horrible service even for a college town. Not sure what the attraction is here. Rude service, stale bread, meats that have a strange taste and texture and some shady business for dessert. There are so many better choices in town. I've truly had better food and service at QT Kitchen. Just not good at all.  The final insult was when we came outside we found a tow truck getting ready to hook our truck up from the spot marked for Jimmie Johns. Asked the tow truck guy what he thought he was doing and he said, \"they call, we take it.\" WTF? I've experienced this \"side business\" that many restaurants run in Philly and New York, but in Tempe Arizona?  Hey Jimmie Johns, if you're gonna run your business like you're in the big city, at least you could try to make a sandwich to match."}
{"text":"When my wife was pregnant she wanted a sub so I ordered a sub/chips from this JJ's to her work less then a mile away.  I asked for it to be there before or around 12:00. The sub never arrived. She told me she had no lunch at all when she arrived home.  I called JJ's to find out what happened and they said that the drive already went home and the sub was delivered. I called the receptionist to confirm and they stated as they document all food deliveries there was none from JJ's the entire day.  I called back and asked to speak to the manager. The manager was very rude and passed the phone to a different employee for about 2 mins after i started to explain the issue.  He got back on the phone and then said they don't know what the driver may have done with the sub.  That was it. NO apology at all.  I had to inform him that i expect my money to be placed back on my card and I asked for his name. He stated \"Mike\" I asked Mike who? He said, that's right. Mike who.   I used to buy 1-11 subs at a time here averaging about once a week for my staff outside of personal orders. This was in 2012. I've not gone back since. There is a much better JJ's on University drive not far from this one. GO THERE, those guys rock!"}
{"text":"Been going to Jimmy Johns for a while and have never had a problem until this one..people that work there have no sort of customer service skills at all."}
{"text":"I have had Jimmy John's in several different cities and it has never really impressed me other than the fast delivery.  While it is a little bit better than Subway I would rather eat at Jersey Mike's if I am going to spend $6-7 on a sandwich.  That being said, I will eat Jimmy John's only when I am stuck in the office.  You cannot beat their speed of delivery."}
{"text":"Clocked out for lunch all the employees got there food my order was not there. So I called the mgr asked for a cookie for the inconvenience mgr said no deal wtf may start going back to subway do you still have great c/s Jared?"}
{"text":"A thirst quenching experience, happy service, napkins, peppers on the side. These are the things that were missing from my visit at this Jimmy Johns. I love Jimmy Johns but this location was a bit of a disappointment.   At this location I was told that I could not get peppers on the side. When I asked why, the drive thru worker shrugged her shoulders and told me I just can't. I asked for management and he told me that Jimmy changed the policy on peppers on the side. My sandwich was good as usual but after eating I discovered I was given no napkins so that made clean up a drag. And half way through eating my meal I ran out of lemonade only to open my cup and see a full cup of ice.   Overall I love Jimmy Johns, I'll just give this location the benefit of doubt..their service is probably better with less errors on most days."}
{"text":"I'm so pissed so jimmy johns is one of my favorite places to eat and the fact that they deliver always keeps me coming back but I Litterally live less than 2 miles from their store and they just told me that from now on they can't deliver past tenaya now I'm only 4 stop lights down and tenaya is only ONE stoplight from there new store!!!!! Wtf kind o delivery place won't deliver a mile and a half from their store I am extremely disappointed I've been ordering from here since the store on tenaya FIRST opened and they were passing out free samples at what used to be albertsons I'm sorry jimmy johns as much as I LOVE your number 9 I will no longer be a customer to a restaurant that doesn't care about their \"valued customers\" freaky fast deliver my a$$ and btw the last 3 times I ordered delivery before the store moved less than a block away from where they were it took OVER an hour to get 2 freakin subs and if I were to drive to the store it would only take me between 5-7 minutes!!!!! I am very very sad and disappointed today!!!!!!! And the lady on the phone was quite rude about the whole thing and stated that she doesn't care about losing a customer!!"}
{"text":"I got delivery here. If I wasnt lazy- I would definitely go to Subway over Jimmy Johns.  Like others have mentioned- the bread seems a lil stale and not all that fresh. They also didnt follow my custom toppings to the tee (forgot my vinegar and mustard on my sandwiches). However, their delivery is quick! They do charge a fee and you gotta tip- so its prolly better to go pick up but laziness wins. They satisfied my sandwich craving within 15 min of ordering so 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Always fast and consistently good. Plus they always remember my order. They are really friendly as well. The managers are wonderful."}
{"text":"Friendly, super-nice staff! Thank YOU for offering and making me a new sandwich for free when I saw your sign about sprouts not recommended for pregnant women, since I'm pregnant!!"}
{"text":"Apparently, Jimmy John's only allows their disabled customers 3 minutes to retrieve their food. Last week  I ordered Jimmy John's delivery for lunch. I asked the delivery guy to call my cell phone when he arrives and I will make my way down to the lobby of my office building. By the time I got there, the security desk tells me that they told the delivery man I was on my way down and would be there in a couple of minutes (knowing that I have a disability and walk slowly) but the sandwich guy said that he couldn't wait and left with my sandwich. Between the phone call and me getting downstairs to the lobby of my office building...it was a total of 4 minutes. What a joke!"}
{"text":"I have been there an unfortunate 3 times to give them the benefit of the doubt.   Horrible SERVICE X3,  horrible SANDWICHES X3  Don't waste your hard earned money.  This is just a joke of a hole in the wall, unless you want to spend $8.00 on bread."}
{"text":"Love the lettuce wraps and all the toppings! We can never go back to Subway or Jersey Mikes because no one compares to our Jimmy Johns! lol very, love, love their food!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my worst customer service experiences, period, happened here. I have been a fairly regular JJ's customer for about 12 years now and my only bad experience ever was here. They got my togo order wrong and then refused to refund me for the petty $6.   Instead of refunding my card they offered to deliver a replacement. I told them on the phone that the sandwich was mostly eaten, since I was hungry and it was not an allergen issue, and I would rather have the refund. However they told me they can only do exchanges and since I have never had a problem at any JJ's I do not have prior knowledge of their policy on such things.  About 15 minutes later the delivery person (apparently the general manager?) arrived and when he saw the partially eaten sandwich he got a pretty bad attitude. After a short conversation he told me there was nothing he could do for me and left with my replacement sandwich; which I hope some one ate instead of it becoming waste in a trash can.  I have to close this by just pointing out that it is odd how this location will fight tooth and nail to not refund 6 dollars but will send a general manager, who likely gets paid $20+/hr, to drive 30 min to drop off the fix. Spending $10+ to save a $6 refund does not make very good business sense. Additionally, since they did not actually fix the problem and were just asinine, they wasted their time and money and still lost a customer at their location for life."}
{"text":"Great sandwich place and they deliver which is great for my busy life style. Food is great, service is fast and drivers are always friendly!"}
{"text":"Awful. Just awful. Absolutely awful-- and I like Jimmy Johns. Went to this location to order my usual sandwich (the only way I've eaten a deli/sub sandwich for the last 25 years) of turkey and provolone absolutely dry nothing on it. Get home and I think everything plus some is on this thing. Called up to let them know and the manager asked what I did order versus what I got- told him and he laughed then asked \"are you sure you ordered that??\" BUDDY IM SUPER PICKY AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY IVE AT A SANDWICH FOR THE LAST 25 years?!?!? His response was \"we can't verify you placed your order correct, we can give you a discount next time you come in\". SERIOUSLY?!?! As if I am making the mistake of giving you 8 bucks again to give me something I did not order! THE WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely agree with other review. This location has serious issues with consistency. Have had three incidences of items being left off the sub. Booooo"}
{"text":"Great service. Ordered on website from surgery center across the street. Ready when I got there. Excellent meal as always."}
{"text":"Some of these negative reviews are laughable - low ratings due to hurt feelings when JJ forgot to deliver a napkin or because they don't have salt and pepper?  This is a local family owned franchise you're impacting over your pettiness. I eat at this JJ at least once a week and have never had a bad experience. It's a sandwich wrapped in paper, tastes good, made fast and in a clean and friendly environment. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Delivery service is really fast, so that's a plus! Great customer service as well. However, my sandwich was extremely soggy to a point where I couldn't even eat half of it. Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"We were visiting from CA and decided to go in for a quick meal.  We both had the #5 Vito.  The sandwich was fresh and delicious.  This was and definitely a step-up from Subway and similar.  The staff was nice and the service was quick.  We will definitely go again on our next visit."}
{"text":"Went there with a free coupon for a free sub they wouldnt take for any subs or let me pay the difference. The cashier was rude she didnt explain there were no substitutes charged extra for an item from another sandwich and then had a temper tantum and walked off the job when i confronted her. Manager came over and said no substitutes or items on the side. Said stuff has to be on sandwich or not at all. Horrible service. Would never go there again."}
{"text":"Fabulous customer service. Never a bad visit yet! It's cooperate setup gone small business experience."}
{"text":"Today I had a Big John w/o mayo, and it was just about heavenly. I asked for Hellmann's Mayonnaise packets on the side and applied it to my liking and for some reason it tasted way better than the mayo they use (which I am pretty sure is Hellmann's Mayo as well). Anyways, today was the best experience I had from Jimmy John's thus far. And may I add, FAST SERVICE! :) JJS is gnarly. (not to keen on the prices though-- for a college student {or atleast me} they tend to be a tad bit pricey [for any 8in. about $4.25 for pickup/$5.25 for delivery]. If you are wondering: \"Why only 3 stars?\"... Well Jimmy John's Sandwiches are no frills get your sandwich and go kind of place, it is a franchise that makes for somewhat decent lunch/dinner option for busy college students/or anyone."}
{"text":"2 times i have ordered a sandwich here. There is no mayonnaise, mustard, oil, vinegar. How the sandwich is fixed is how i eat it. It  is dry and without flavor."}
{"text":"They SUCK! Ordered a sandwich, got everything wrong, the bread and chips. Called and explain3d, they didint apologize or anything. 20 Minutes later, they arrive at my door with a new sandwich and chips. She then asked for the old order back. Well it was gone and she left. Terrible service because that sandwich was going to waste. Terrible customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns advertisement of \"freaky fast delivery\" is the biggest lie ever. We placed our order over an hour ago and still haven't received our sandwich. 1 hour and 13 minutes and counting.... I called to check on the order and the person who answered the phone informed me that they only had one person delivering food. I normally get this when I order Sunday mornings, but they usually tell me."}
{"text":"I had a great experience with this jimmy johns. They were efficient and delivered my food rather quickly. I ordered three sandwiches, several cookies, chips and drinks. They got everything right."}
{"text":"We were having a family gathering and ordered online for 10 people.   I liked the online ordering, especially being able to add the person's name for each item. Food was prepared as ordered and was ready when we got there. HOWEVER, one of the sandwiches was for a 6 year old so we got a 'slim', which doesn't come with veggies, but she wanted lettuce which you can't add online.  We were going to buy lettuce at Harris teeter but, it didn't make sense to buy a whole head for one tiny sandwich. Here's where the problem comes in. I asked them to put a little lettuce on a sandwich wrapper for the 'slim' and the woman there (pretty sure she was the manager) said no, if you wanted 'veggies' you had to order a #5. I said I didn't want veggies, I just wanted a little lettuce. No, that would be another $1.50. So we left without the lettuce. Ok, that's really poor customer service. If someone buys $70 worth of food and you can't throw in a handful of lettuce, that's insane. If anyone had asked for 'extra' lettuce on their sandwich no problem. In fact, if I hadn't told her it was for the slim I wonder if she would have given me some more lettuce. The poor guys who were working there looked so embarrassed watching our exchange."}
{"text":"When calling, rude college kid didn't know how to answer basic questions. Basic customer service training needed."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's sells tasty sandwiches. The service is quick, even during the lunch rush. I got a combo with a pickle... and received not a sliver, but a huge, deli-style pickle. Oh, and they deliver, which is nice when you need a sandwich and can't leave the office, or the couch.  An added bonus is they offer free smells. These are really nice when you're not in the mood to eat, but want something satisfying."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns.   Better than all others (subway, I'm looking at you), IMHO. Food quality, taste, experience and fastness are all high points! I love that they deliver, and that they're open late.   But I think my favorite part (aside from the yummy food) is the friendlyness of the staff. They always greet you when you come in, and say goodbye when you leave, and I have yet to have an interaction that's not pleasant.  Also, they really are freaky fast!! One time I ordered to deliver at the Art+Design building, and they were there *less than 6 minutes later*. How is that even possible??"}
{"text":"Love this place very clean and courteous customer service. Keep up the good work. Did I mention the always have fresh bread, they sell the day old bread to customers at a great price."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are ok for the price you pay they could be better. Customer service isn't the greatest either."}
{"text":"On average, I eat here about once a week (it adds up), and the last time I ordered for delivery, I asked my friend to run outside to pick it up for me as I was busy, and the delivery man (Jeff) pressured her into tipping!!! So, reluctantly, she offered a three dollar tip (as if $12.70 for two mediocre sandwiches was not enough) bringing our price up to to a hefty $17.76 in total (I know it doesn't add up because when I finished on the phone he did not include tax when he added it up.) On top of all of this \"incredible\" service, he never gave us a time frame on when it was going to be delivered!!! And when he asked where it should be delivered to, I gave him a public place with the cross streets and he had a sassy response of \"good thing I know the address\". I'm going to end here because no one likes reading a small novel before they visit a restaurant, so if you want some decent sandwiches with some not so decent prices and even less decent service, consider JJ's..."}
{"text":"Horrible service! I work in one of the stores In the same plaza that this jimmy johns is located. But on a consistent basis I have had to wait for almost two hours for my sandwich to get there. Which means I don't get to eat for my entire shift, because I depended on them to get my food to me in a timely manner. When the driver finally arrived, he was rude and refused to guarantee the sandwich for free as jimmy johns promises if the sandwich is delivered late. The drivers are not capable of navigating less than half a mile from this jimmy johns. Don't order from this jimmy johns unless you're planning on not being able to eat your lunch."}
{"text":"Short: A bit expensive compared to other sub shops, but surprisingly worth it.   Long: Ran here because I felt like something different. I went through the drive-thru (like other fast-food restaurants) and ordered a #2 Roast Beef. For a little under $6, seems a bit pricey for what you get size-wise, but it tasted far better than most sub shops. Service was fast, but they weren't busy at that time.   I'd go again for sure. It's on the top of my list for sandwich shops in the valley.  EDIT: I returned here and got their \"club\" sandwich on their french bread, which is the same sandwich with twice the meat, and that was great. Highly recommend the clubs on french bread."}
{"text":"The speed and efficiency of this location gets a 5 star rating. They saved my butt in a catering emergency situation. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Love this place....there bread is amazing! Such a refreshing change from Subway. Don't forget to try one of their chocolate chunk cookies...they are super good. I work nearby and we do group orders online at least once a week. They usually have it to is on less than 15 minutes."}
{"text":"First time visit at this name sub shop with a friend and ate inside. VERY high step to get into booths. Counter-ordered food with very abrupt/rude employee taking order.  Took my order and money and that was it, no directions on how to get the order was given, even after I said it was my first time there. Just handed a receipt with a number. Went back to booth to wait to be called to the other end of counter. Another employee calls out your number and I encountered yet another employee who was unfriendly, just quickly shoving the two subs at me. When we opened the packaged subs, we saw they were not cut in half. I went back to the counter and asked if they had plastic knives? \"No, we don't, you can bring it back up and we'll cut it\".  I had to go back to the booth, pick up both unwrapped sandwiches/wrappers, go back to counter so the employee could cut them with a knife, again, doing so, as if it was a major inconvenience.  The sandwiches were alright, nothing to write home about. Not sure what all the rage is about as we had heard it was the best sub shop and people whom we knew were so glad it came to the area. :("}
{"text":"Their slogan is freaky fast, and boy do they live up to it. Ordered a slim 2 in the drive thru with no one in front of me, and as I pulled around, the bag with my food was hanging out of the window. Love coming here and love how fast it is."}
{"text":"Food?...well it is just a sandwich shop...nothing more and nothing less. This  location has a bad and illegal habit of asking for ID on credit cards! Last time the kid asked me for ID, I objected and asked him if he is selling me Alcohol, tobacco, or firearms, or whether he is an Officer of the Law! When he said no, I told him then he has no frigging business to ask for my ID...if my credit card clears, that's all he needs to know!  The owner of the chain is somehow a disgusting fellow, not only he is rare animal hunter, recently he bought some home-raised elks from a local farmer, Brought his hunting buddies with high-powered guns, and wanted to shoot the animals still in the cage! Really a brave guy!  We have been listening to his rambling and threatening claims that he is going to move his HQ from the city because of the Illinois's taxes and such, not considering he has made his millions here on the back of workers and customers. What's wrong  with paying a fairer share of taxes now that the State needs all the help she can get.  My few dollar worth of sandwiches would not affect his millions, but I have a hard time to justify spending my money there....sandwich or no sandwich!"}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns but this location is terrible!   The last two times in the drive thru they've overcharged me!   The first time I didn't catch it until after I looked at my bank statement (they charged me for $9 something,  when I always order a slim that comes to $4.88) . The second time I did catch it because I asked for my receipt and so they did void out the overcharge and charged me the correct price. But to overcharged two consecutive times is ridiculous. They need someone to work the cash register who is a little more meticulous!!"}
{"text":"i'm not happy, this is in no way against the store, but against the corporate head office. i have been under the weather lately, and there's just so much pizza and Chinese food a girl can order, one does occasionally crave raw veggies, especially when they're topped onto cold cuts and cheese. anyways, as i looked up the closest store to me and called, i was informed that i am out of their delivery zone...by ONE BLOCK! apparently there is nothing i or the store can do about it, because it is up to corporate. there are 6 apartment complexes where i live, the fact that corporate will not let them deliver a block out of their radius, greatly diminishes the profit margin. i understand that they have their hype of super fast delivery to uphold, but if they tell people that they are just out of their zone, they can deliver just not super fast, i guarantee people would understand, instead of just saying sorry no can do. the gentleman i spoke with was very polite and sympathized with me, but that still doesn't get me fed. boo on you corporate."}
{"text":"I have never written a review before but this place is sooo terrible. I really like Jimmy Johns but this location has terrible service and the food is really bad too. I have used the online ordering service for different locations in the past and never had any issues before this place. Matt, I'm guessing the manager, is rude and unprofessional. I ordered the beach club with NO MAYO. Not only was the sandwich lathered up with mayo, but it also had enough lettuce for a salad and no avocado.  When I called, Matt said I never asked for no mayo (I was looking at my order online and could clearly see \"no mayo\" listed). I told him that and continued to argue with me. Whatever- he wasted his time arguing because he still had to refund me after I called corporate so moral of the story- this location sucks. I added two pictures of my gross sandwich. Don't eat at this location!!!"}
{"text":"The workers here suck. To sum it up, I paid extra for a dill pickle that I never got. I asked for it on the side in a separate bag, I opened my one bag thinking \"maybe they just put it in here\" and nope. No pickle. So I go up to the cashier who helped me and tell him I paid for a pickle and the cashier asked if I had a receipt. I told him no, I didn't get one from you. He said \"they should have given it to you at the end\". I then told him they did not give me one. Instead of being like \"well here is a pickle for the inconvenience\", he said nothing and did not care to help the situation. Way to lose business. Also, get it together."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's food has always been good; however, they refuse to deliver to our house which is 1.8 miles from their store.  They will deliver to the High School that is 1.4 miles from their store, but not our sub-division.  My son broke his leg and we wanted food delivered.  All they would say is \"corporate sets our range\".  I will vote by never doing business with this location ever again."}
{"text":"As I read the negative ad I just have to wonder if that customer mistook another sandwich store for this one. I went on two separate days and the service was excellent, the food was great, and the service was quick. The employees were smiling and happy. The sandwich was absolutely fantastic and filling without being overstuffed. I wouldn't hesitate to go. Back and assure you I will. I just wish they had one closer to me for delivery because I'd order everyday. Bottom line is: 1. Fast service 2. Great Food 3. Great Value 4. Pleasant staff 5. Clean Restaurant What else could you want. Try em, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Really pissed that this sandwich shop is 1.8 miles from my house and won't deliver to me. I love their sandwiches usually but don't understand their delivery system...thought it was anything under 2 miles to ensure fast delivery."}
{"text":"Fat order from work today,  as always right on time. Filled our bellies and back to work.  Way to jimmy johns subs. ."}
{"text":"We wanted a good sandwich so we decided to go to Jimmy Johns since we have eaten there in the past and enjoyed it. Well let me tell you what a mistake that was, it was horrible the bread was hard the sandwich was dry and it was put together terrible. The service sucked the young kids working there made me feel uncomfortable! I will not be going back ever again, and I will inform friends and family to never go there!"}
{"text":"first time going to Jimmy Johns. ordered a country club sandwich and added avacado and cheese.   was charged for avacado. sandwich without avacado no cheese and no bacon( bacon was on recipe )and looked pita full. so disappointed.  the manager asked me to return to location to receive sandwich that they should've made correctly.  I asked if they would deliver and was denied and told I was out of their area,even though we live near bolder and lake Meade.  very disappointed. they didn't offer to refund money nothing.  so needless to say we are throwing our expensive sandwiches out and ordering pizza. thank you Jimmy john"}
{"text":"My husband and I went last week and had a very disappointing experience. At 5:30 p.m. we were the only customers in the store. Our first discovery was JJ's doesn't offer sweeteners of any kind for their tea.  When asked why, the young man behind the counter said \"The owner doesn't believe in sweet tea.\"  Well, what about a large segment of the customer base?  Then, my sandwich was improperly prepared, so when I asked for a side of mustard- the young man standing behind the counter, chatting with the five idle employees, indicated the owner doesn't \"believe in cups for sides.\"  He then said that they only had mustard in a jar so he couldn't give me any mustard.  What?  While I was only asking for a tablespoon of mustard- if they were unable to provide me with the mustard on the sandwich - they could have offered to make me a new sandwich.  But that would have been \"customer service\"- something sadly lacking on my visit.  When I asked to speak to the Manager another employee indicated they didn't have a Manager.  One of the signs in the window advertising employment opportunities indicated \"Looking for Rock Stars.\"  I can see why!"}
{"text":"I appreciate the details and some may say that a sandwich is a small detail; I say that a good sandwich can go a long way and make a big difference in your day. Today, not only did they deliver quickly (10 minutes) but the sandwich was beautifully constructed, and they even put a  reasonable amount of napkins in the bag. Great Job."}
{"text":"I've been to many Jimmy Johns around Central Illinois, but this one is by far the best. The restaurant is a great size, so there is always seating and the service is very fast. I mean faster than they claim. I love the sandwiches and will never get  tired of eating here. The only downfall is that you have to pay the meter to park in their lot."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick bite after church.  Ordered a roast beef sandwich..... Couldn't find the meat amongst all the roll and lettuce.  Sad....."}
{"text":"I've been calling my order in here a lot lately. They are always super friendly and when I show up my order is ready to go.  I'm not sure what they're doing different from the West Charleston location but I went there last week and my sandwich was super sub par. I guess the S Durango location puts a little love into their sandwiches!!!   Highly recommend this location :)"}
{"text":"I regularly order from the Jimmy John's on cedar, but my brother decided to order from this one. Will never happen again... He ordered a sub (not sure of name), and it smelled really good. He also ordered no onions, and when the sandwich arrived it of course had extra onions... Not knowing my brother bit into the sandwich, he's allergic to onions. And after contacting the store, the manager, Danny, asked my brother, \"why can't you just pick the onions off?\" I of course was frustrated. I tipped the driver $3, and I want ever dime back from that store. 7 hours later, I'm still waiting on a call back regarding my refund... I will NEVER come or order from here."}
{"text":"I have eaten at/ordered from the Jimmy John's on Mill Ave a couple times and the sandwiches are decent. They are of course better than most large chain shops like Subway and Quiznos but with a surplus of sandwich places in Tempe, they wouldn't be my first or second choice. Not to down them too much but I think they're a bit overrated--- I was expecting something spectacular from all the buzz! On the bright side they do deliver late into the night which is good for this type of city. However, I definitely have found sub places I like more and probably won't be having JJ's for quite a while."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and quick to make the food. But as far as the food goes it's not worth the money. The bread is very thin and hard and the sandwiches are very plain and lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"To be honest I have only eaten their sandwiches on 3 occasions..one time a friend surprised me and  brought a sandwich..the other two times were small promotional sandwiches delivered by wonderful,bubbly ,young ladies...but alas ..even cuties don't make a bad sandwich taste good. The bread was awful and there was massive amounts of mayo."}
{"text":"Okay, I was sick of hearing about these subs so I had to nosh here just to weigh in. First off, I think the use of \"world's greatest sandwiches\" and  \"gourmet\" is a bit of false advertising. Um, I'm fairly certain the avocado on my beach club came from a tube. Also, I don't get why I was instructed to reach over the counter if I wanted my food in a bag or needed napkins. I thought that's why one exercises the phrase \"to go.\" I'm not lazy, but gosh darnit there are three of you and no other customers are here. I don't get it. They'll drive miles for free to deliver the food but can't be arsed to throw the stuff in a bag? Even (Insert crappiest fast food chain of  your choice here) does that! Since you guys can do eveything so fast you have plenty of time left over to put the freakin' food in a bag for a girl with her hands full already! Whew, sorry. Moving on...  I'd like to dispel the most prevalent assertions swirling around the much ballyhooed Jimmy John's.  #1. \"They are waaay better than Subway.\" This is true. But, isn't that like saying a c*** punch is much more pleasant than a double c*** punch? Edging out Subway in a taste test is the not brass ring to be reaching for!  #2. \"They are soooo cheap.\" Yeah, not really. I think it's an okay value in relation to the quality, but stop raving about it like it's a $2 trip to Tijuana with tacos and tequila included. (Because that would be fantabulous.)  #3. \"They have the BEST bread.\" I concede the bread is the best thing about the sandwich, but that's only because the rest of my sammich's innards were nothing spectacular. The turkey is just so so. Not bad, but not flavorful at all. So, the bread is not the earth shattering, yeasty lusciousness that people make it out to be. Truth be told I'd be happier if there were options. (They have some kind of sliced wheat that they basically told me no one likes!)   It's not that I would never partake because I get that its decent and they deliver. But come on my friends, quit swilling the kool aid."}
{"text":"Terrible service and utterly waste of time. Don't bother. Just shut this chain location down. It is ruining your name."}
{"text":"First time eating at a JJ's and it was an unsatisfactory one. We ordered a sub which was about $6.50 each after tax. The guy at the cashier had no customer service skills at all. We were a bit confused but he just rushed us and didn't even offer drinks or a combo meal or something like that. Also, there were a bunch of employees in the station and they were just plain loud talking nonsense. With regards to their subs, it was not worth it. It was literally just some meat, bread, lettuce, and tomatoes. There were more flavor from the packaged deli meat at the grocery store. At least I now know not to bother with this place again."}
{"text":"4 stars on the sub, 2 on the service, average of 3.  Went inside to pickup to-go order.  You have to bag your own food when order is ready.  Assuming this was put in place so people could verify they were given everything they ordered while bagging before leaving.  However this definitely slows down handling the lunch crowd. Had three people behind me waiting to get their orders as I fumbled placing my food in bags dropping chips on the floor, cookie, etc.  All well and good, but as I asked for help was surprised to be told you will need to do this yourself.   Really just looking for a steady hand to assist me"}
{"text":"Maybe it was the after lunch rush but the entry doors were hazy from being wiped and tables weren't cleaned. If you want S&P best bring your own."}
{"text":"If this location is representative of all Jimmy John's, I would never eat there again.  Delivery is unreliable and a nightmare.  They don't deliver when they say they will and often the order is wrong.  Today we had an occasion to provide lunch for our staff.  The order arrived 45 minutes late, no condiments and not even close enough chips for an order of this size.  Who delivers sandwiches with no condiments.  Don't make excuses of being short staffed for lousy service.  A heads up on the front end is better than a bad review on the other.  Honestly.  Shape up!  Clearly this is not the first complaint given these other reviews."}
{"text":"They offer delivery but won't travel the 1.8 miles to Children's Hospital for delivery. Maybe they ride bikes for delivery and that's too far, but no where else around here has such a small radius for delivery."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst service I've ever received at a dining establishment. The cashier was high, I had to place my order three separate times before finally receiving my sandwich. When I did, the ingredients weren't even kind of fresh, and the bread was stale.   Jimmy John's has a great marketing team, but this location just doesn't deliver on those expectations. I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"Bumbed out!!!! My daughter was visiting from CA and told her about the freaky fast delivery and what a shame. 45 min for delivery..... More like freaking slow delivery!!!"}
{"text":"Those beautifully wrapped \"unwiches\" you see in pictures translates into tuna balled up in wet lettuce. Bleh. 2 starts because the tuna has a great flavor."}
{"text":"\"Freaky fast\" indeed. Its right by my current jobsite and I only have half an hour for my lunch.  This sub shop is always speedy, and their sandwiches are still always made as if they took their time.  Its always clean, the employees are always in great spirits, and they always have great music of all different genres playing that help me forget about work for my brief getaway. If you're in a crunch for time near this place and a sandwich sounds good, this place is great."}
{"text":"Tried lunch here for my first time. Quick service, they were very friendly even though they were busy. I ordered a vegetarian sandwich... The deluxe or something huge like that. I substituted the white bun with wheat bread and it was so delicious! I like that I don't have to pick and choose the toppings, but that I can make changes if want something different. Definitely visiting again!"}
{"text":"My first visit to a Jimmy Johns. I had seen the T.V. ad about how fast they are. We'll I walked in, went to counter to order, ordered a #2, was asked if I wanted cheese and said yes. By the time I had scanned my card the sandwich was made. FREAKY FAST. The staff here is great and the sandwich was superb. I will definitely be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Just like the commercial they're that fast. I invite you to find faster service and let me know.   The food is awesome and always fresh.   The staff are also friendly.  A normal hang out for me."}
{"text":"Staying at a hotel 1.2 miles away from this location. \"We don't deliver that far away\". Seriously?!!  Three hotels and a bunch of car dealerships a stones throw from your store, but you don't deliver. My thoughts are that somebody didn't want to deliver close to closing time. Just tell me that, don't lie to me."}
{"text":"$4.50 for a Slim and $5.50 for a #1-4. Yet another price hike for this location. It's getting absurd! 3oz of meat for that price is an awful value. I'm not sure what the operators of this location are thinking, or if they are thinking. I can tell you this much- they've priced themselves out of consideration for my family. Definitely not worth the value. OVERPRICED!!"}
{"text":"Decided to go out of the way and go to this particular location. Was greeted with a rude \"what do you want?\" Every table was dirty. There was soda spilled on the floor and was already to the point that it was sticky. Overall worst Jimmy Johns experience."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the place is always clean, inside and out. Access from the road is easy. The food is good.   They're always super light on the meat and heavy with the lettuce. I guess that's the Jimmy way - skimp on the cold cut and generous with everything else."}
{"text":"I purchased a water cup & decided to try the lemonade to see if I wanted to buy a lemonade instead and a young man walks up to me looks inside my cup and physically makes me throw it out I have never experienced such a rude employee in my life whoever they are they need to be fired because they are a disgrace to jimmy johns."}
{"text":"Person on phone said they will deliver to my home. Suggested that I order on line. Tried to order but website says will not deliver to address. Called the store back multiple times with out success. They need to have an additional phone lines for customers and update the website for deliveries."}
{"text":"The sandwich was small, there was only one slice of meat and no cheese, which I had asked for and the other sandwich didn't have the hot peppers we ordered as an extra topping on the Vito. I won't be ordering from here again. On the upside the delivery time was fast less then 20 mins and they came right up to the door of our room at the hospital."}
{"text":"Was searching for a good deli in the area since I am from out of town. No luck in finding a deli but Jimmy John's made up for it. As with most of the other locations, the service was good, food tasted fresh and service was quick. Clean as well. I will be back if I am craving a good sandwich. (Obviously ordered the Bootlegger)"}
{"text":"Fast Delivery? How about NO delivery the store is on Arizona ave. and Warner. I live on  Dobson and Warner that  is less than 2 miles away. They refuse to deliver to me because they say I'm out of their delivery zone. I ask what store do I call? and they told me I don't have one come get it. WOW! I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"For the money this is the best sub shop ever.  I like the number nine I like the number for like the number seven for like the number 12 I like the number 15 so many different options and the chips are great too as well as the chocolate chip cookie.  Parking is brutal"}
{"text":"Got my sandwich in no time. The place was clean and empty so it was nice to eat in on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Wtf guys. What kind of cut is this. I was asked if I wanted it cut and I said yes, then this. This?"}
{"text":"Never heard of this place tell I saw it on the side of a NASCAR and the following day a TV ad, I knew I had to give this place a shot.   Went there yesterday and had the #9 on wheat bread and it was good, went back today and had the #9 on the french bread and it was fantastic. This place is a must if you are looking for a great sandwich. Eli you'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't very good what so ever. And I may add expensive. I would much rather go to subway. The employees are also very loud."}
{"text":"Won't deliver and I'm less than a mile away... Also, you should probably let people know that when you choose the wheat option, it's a sandwich not a sub?"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good but nothing fast here. Always slow to get it done. I always see like 10 people at other JJ's this one has 1 maybe 2 need to pick it up."}
{"text":"This is by far the friendliest JJ's not only in the valley but in Spokane, WA and Moscow, ID. They have created a very positive atmosphere and genuinely care about the customer. I love joking with the staff and they have always said thank you for my military service. As a veteran, some businesses ignore the contributions made by women in the military. Kindness pays because I do not spend my money where I am not appreciated for my patronage. Hats off to all the staff at this location. Obviously, they have people who model quality leadership skills."}
{"text":"Great subs and service.  Kathryn at the register is awesome.  Super nice and efficient.  Get in and out, all with a smile.  Good work!!"}
{"text":"How does this place survive?  Their sandwiches are boring and bland.  No flavor at all. And super fast delivery? I live in Middleburg Hts exactly 1.9 miles away from the Berea store and they don't deliver to my area?"}
{"text":"Only took them 11 minutes to deliver our order. Pretty good sandwiches! I do like capriotti's better though."}
{"text":"One of the best places you can come to! Owner is the nicest person you will ever meet. Food is excellent, staff are super friendly and food is fast! Honestly, you can't get faster than that! ;-)"}
{"text":"$3 Delivery Charge!  Such BS!  This JJ location also makes subtle but annoying order mistakes.  Sweet iced tea ordered. Unsweet delivered.  BBQ chips ordered. Plain delivered. Sandwich ordered cut in half. Not cut.  If you do one thing (deliver sandwiches, chips and drinks), you better do it right. And better not charge $3 to deliver a $7 sandwich!"}
{"text":"I ordered the veg sandwich and there is no avocado spread on it. The vegetables are very less and the bread is awful.  This will be my last visit to JJ.  I feel Subway is best."}
{"text":"Great sandwich. I had the #5 and it was really good. Service was super fast even with the special going on. The place was clean and servers were polite even under the pressure. I will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service awesome food! Always fast, always friendly, always delicious. Super fast delivery"}
{"text":"There are so many cute girls here it's unreal the boys don't even compare to how cute these girls are."}
{"text":"I love this location. They're clean, friendly staff, great quality ingredients and they are one of the few sandwich shops that offer sprouts on their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Never disappointed with the sandwhiches. But what is the problem with the employees not wanting to bag the sandwhiches? If the customer is supposed to bag our own food then put the bags where we can reach them seriously, so food is great service not so wonderful."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit at Jimmy John's!! Had a BLT , great customer service. Soft bread, DELISH!!"}
{"text":"They are known for their freaky fast service.  I work at the outlets, and I really wanted something more healthy than the options at the food court. I decided to order a sandwich Jimmy Johns. I ordered the country club. I skimmed the reading and thought I ordered turkey, bacon, and provolone cheese. Alas, it was ham. I'm not a huge fan of ham, but it was still a pretty tasty sandwich. I ordered the huge sandwich, and boy was it big. Next time I think I'll order a smaller sandwich or try the club lulu which is a blt with turkey. My sandwich came out to $6.50, and after tax and delivery fee it came out to $7.50. A bit pricier to get it delivered.   It's a pretty decent price, but I don't know if it's worth it to get it delivered all the time. I'd rather save my money for something else.   They were freakishly fast. I ordered my sandwich at about 5:10 and I got it about 10 to 15 minutes later. That is super fast!"}
{"text":"amazing sandwiches, amazing quality, and amazing customer service. Honestly, my only problem was the lack of pickle chips to put on my sandwiches! other than that, literally perfection. and believe me, when it comes to sandwiches, I'm picky. My go-to for long days after school."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and now they have same sandwiches wrapped in lettuce!! Fantastic! ! Go for the loaded Turkey with avocado wrapped in lettuce. It Don't get any better"}
{"text":"ordered online, took over 30 minutes to deliver. i work across the street. once i open the bag i notice that they forgot the chips that i ordered so i call back. the girl was really rude and said it would take at least 10 min to bring them over. guy walks in throws the bag on my desk and runs out.... thanks?"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever.  2 weeks ago waited  4 minutes at drive thru to order, finally pulled to window and employees just weren't paying attention.  Ordered my food, added onions when I said no onions  and forgot my chips.   Today I ordered online at 3:00...at 3:35. No sandwich. I called to cancel and girl tells me she doesn't know how to refund my money...advised her to ask manager..guess we will see what happens. BTW I live less than a mile away!"}
{"text":"The Totally Tuna sandwich is delicious, it is one of my favorites. I tried other sandwich like the Big John's and the Turkey Tom and it was not as good as I hoped especially since I added Dijon mustard, it was too sweet in my opinion."}
{"text":"I frequent Jimmy john's often and always love their sandwiches.  After raving about this place to my mom, she finally said she wanted to try it out.  At all the other locations I've been to, the staff has been extremely friendly.   This was not the case at this location.  A young man took our order and then went on to make our sandwiches.  A girl came up to the register where we were ready to pay, totally ignored us and proceeded to take someone else's order and payment while we were standing right in front of her.   After telling her we still needed to pay, she rolled her eyes and went on to take our payment, all the while making inappropriate jokes about strippers to her coworkers.  Completely unprofessional.  Once we got home we found the bread on our sandwiches to be rock hard and totally inedible.   After having such great service at the other Jimmy john's, I'm really disappointed in the service at this location."}
{"text":"Love Jimmy John's.  Have never been to this location before.  Food was great and exactly as ordered.  We had out food within 1 min of being ordered.  Emploees are friendly."}
{"text":"I visited two jimmy johns locations. I am disappointed in the service. The subs were ok but they will not serve anything on the side. This is a corporate policy I guess. I'm surprised that they are not customer service based with all the competition in this town. I called the customer service number to let them know I was unhappy about that and they basically were not interested. Advised me it was a policy because they don't want special orders holding up the line. I was the only person there! The subs aren't good enough to put up with the lack of service."}
{"text":"I eat here frequently as I work a block away.  Every time I go in for my lunch the service is quick and my sandwich is almost always amazing.  Only once since I started going to this one was I not completely satisfied.  Staff is courteous and make good sandwiches.  I think it's convenient that it is attached to a gas station.  They are separated so it isn't like there is gas station traffic walking through while you are eating.  All in all I will continue to eat there on a regular basis."}
{"text":"So normally I'm all about Jimmy John's. However, this location wanted \"guaranteed gratuity\" to deliver outside of their delivery radius. Granted, the address was in a different Jimmy Johns' radius; however, because our location was \"so far outside of their delivery radius\" (exactly one mile away from their store), the CSR wanted 5 dollars guaranteed gratuity. When I laughed, because I obviously thought he was joking about charging as much as a sub to go one single mile, he said, \"well I hope you have a good night\" and hung up.  Normally, I love the staff of Jimmy John's. After he hung, all I could think was \"is this dude for real?!?!\". Anyway, not planning on ordering from Jimmy John's ANYTIME in the near future."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, and they were so fast I nearly did freak.  Unwich helping me keep it carb free! Holler!"}
{"text":"First I'd like to start out by say, every Jimmy Johns I've walked into was always a quick, friendly, and fun.    But today broke that impression.  I walked into the store with my brother. We ordered our sandwiches and drinks. We walk over to the machine and everything was flat or out of syrup. The only available beverages were water and iced tea. We confronted a employee and no one process our request.    While waiting for the soda machine and sandwiches an employee bursts out yelling at the top of his lunges to another employee, \"give me my money,... I don't care if I make a scene,... Come on hit me!\"    Turns out the employee made a big scene for $2. I don't know exactly why he needed his $2 before a huge line of customers but he went on and on about is money. After another employee called the cops. The yelling employee ran off.   First off, it was really unprofessional. Second you shouldn't yell and cuss in front of children.   After all the commotion, 20 mins later, our sandwiches where made and then we immediately left. There were families that paid and left in the middle of it, not even getting a refund.   Even after obtaining our sandwiches, nothing tasted fresh. I was really disappointed with the lack of teamwork, profanity used in front of children, quality of the food, and the environment I walked into.      Judging by other reviews, the management at the Desert Ridge Jimmy Johns isn't up to par.   If i could give no stars, I would. I will not be retuning to Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"Thought I would give it a second try waited twenty minutes for them to answer, then they told me they wouldn't deliver to me, not even half a mile away, said it was to far for their driver, seriously bad service"}
{"text":"Just waited 40 minutes for delivery of one sandwich, that's it.  While annoyed I started reading the reviews and I can see everyone is having issues with this location.  Once my sandwich came I asked the delivery driver if they were busy and she said \"No.\"  Well ok so why did it take 40 minutes when all other locations take about 15 hence the \"freaky fast delivery\" of Jimmy Johns.  She responded oh well we got slammed with 6 orders.  Now I'm eating and the bread is super stale and hard, and the overall taste is awful compared to what I'm used to with Jimmy Johns.  I can tell by the zero responses from management on here that they do not care at all.  Sad because I would go to this location but now I will drive farther for a better experience.  Horrible, will not be back unless I am told they have changed owners or someone steps up to change this."}
{"text":"Awesome subs, super fast service. Can't be beat!"}
{"text":"My bread was ROCK HARD! Wth? You didn't notice that when you made the sandwich? Did you use a power tool to slice the bread or was it pre sliced days ago? Went straight to the trash and I rebuilt the mediocre meat on some sliced bread. If you do try the place go easy on the mayo! It was everywhere! Maybe trying to compensate for the granite hard French bread, FAIL. Too many sandwich shops in town to even consider this place again. Delivery? No it was not freaky fast."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING! POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! WILL NEVER ORDER AGAIN!   It really takes a lot for me, not only to complain to the restaurant itself but to go through the grueling process of writing a review is unheard of in my world. I would have even kept my mouth closed and continued to frequent this establishment had they made me feel like a valued customer which I am and would have continued to be.   First of all, the \"manager\" Bo is completely incompetent. My (almost) everyday ritual was to order the EXACT same sandwich through delivery and it has been good, most of the time. However, today it was terrible and only when you have a problem with your order will you start to see how poorly the rest of the business is run.   After explaining my intention to take my business elsewhere due to the poor experience and also let others know, this \"manager\" Bo told me that I can stop \"threatening\" him. That doesn't sound like something a manager or someone with a vested interest in the company would say now does it? And furthermore, since when is letting a company know that you will take your business elsewhere a threat?   Anyway, my tuna sandwich that I order almost everyday had more mayo than actual tuna. Thin strip of tuna, an inch layer of mayo glooping off the sandwich and getting all over my hands and everywhere else. It was very sloppy, wet, soggy and absolutely disgusting and they were not willing to fix the situation unless it was immediately at that moment due to a \"new company policy\". I will be calling and speaking to the GM tomorrow to question if this policy is real and if it will be continued because obviously you do not want another sandwich immediately when you have had a disgusting mess of one today.   I will not be returning and will be spending a lot of time letting others know how bad the service is with this place. YUCK!"}
{"text":"I love this location!  I used to work in the same plaza and order lunch here a lot. Since I moved to a new chiropractor location, I will be ordering from them again. It's right down the street. The staff always was very friendly and new me by name. Love this place!"}
{"text":"My son went and got us subs for dinner last night.   I had the JJBLT.   Not good.   The bacon had an odd taste, and, despite my request for \"Crispy\", it was soggy.   I ended up eating a lettuce, mayo and tomato sandwich.  Disappointing consumption of calories."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to any Jimmy John's and we were looking forward to it as so many of our friends loved their subs. Very disappointed with the food!!! Placed our order online for pick up - it was ready when my son arrived, so that aspect was great.   Our order consisted of 3 subs and 1 sandwich.  There wasn't very much meat on any of the subs and they loaded with lettuce - the bacon was cold and disgusting.  My sandwich had very little turkey and I paid for extra avocado spread on two items and there was barely any on either.  Very surprised they charge extra for a lot of items that should free - like cheese.  We won't be back since there are many other sub places with much better subs."}
{"text":"This review is for the location at 32nd Bell Rd. located by the Starbucks and UPS shipping store. There location is hidden. The restaurant was nice and clean, Staff was polite decided to order number 7, had to pay for extra cheese. Why? Doesn't that come already with a sandwich? Overall I would choose Jersey Mikes any day of the week."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and the staff are all super nice. I've been grabbing sandwiches while on vacation at the Cibola Vista. I'd recommend this location to anyone!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at this location while I was downtown today. It was amazing watching those guys run in and out making their deliveries I was only there about 30 minutes and I saw the same few guys make multiple deliveries. When they weren't on the bikes they were cleaning windows and bathrooms. These guys hustle and get things done. My 'hunter club' turkey sub was great too! Well done JJ!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches for less than 5 dollars.  They're great, as long as you're not looking for any hot sandwiches.  Bread is slightly chewy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside.  The hallmark of just baked daily bread.  Probably my idea of a great sandwich bread.    Meats, veggies, cheese, and condiments are pretty standard and fresh.  I think it says a lot when you pay for you food, walk over to get your drink, and they hand your sandwich to you on your way over to the soda fountain."}
{"text":"The customer service stinks. I ordered a Vito with extra dressing. When I opened the package the sandwich was swimming in oil. Called the manager, he gave me a hard time. If you have a problem with an order. Check the bag before you leave the store. They do not like to make it right."}
{"text":"FREAKY SLOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ordered delivery at 1:57 pm.  ONE sandwich.  Arrived at 2:45 pm.  No apology.  I ordered because I was STARVING and this is obviously unacceptable service from a business whose tagline is \"freaky fast\".   Oh and my house is a 4 minute drive from the shop.  My son was sleeping which is why I tried delivery.  Never again.  Never again.  Do NOT recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by the service I received yesterday.  I placed my order at around 1:15 and the order was not delivered for over 20 minutes.  I ordered a tuna sandwich and it was over 100 degrees yesterday, so needless to say, I was a bit concerned about the sandwich.  When I mentioned to the delivery person that the order took a long time, he did not say a word - not sorry nor thank you.  He just handed me the sandwich and left.  Mind you, I had already put a gratuity on the bill on my online order ($3.00 on a $7.00 sandwich), so he was not \"stiffed\" on the delivery.  When I called the location, I was told that it was extremely busy and that is the reason the order took so long, but I was assured that the sandwich was made moments before it went out for delivery.   The sandwich was good, so no complaints on the quality, but the customer service was horrendous."}
{"text":"I was at this local Jimmy Johns and below is what happened. You might think I am being a pain but I defend myself in the below emails.   The sandwiches are great. I was grading this based upon lack of satisfying the customer.     Thomas  Below is Jimmy's reasoning:  \"I serve the people that serve you. The proper way to serve on the side is a plastic 2 oz cup and lid. The cost of the cup and lid is 32 cents. In order for me to pay employees, insurance, rent, utilities, overhead and interest on the loan for that store I'd have to charge $1.20 and I would make a dime. I made the decision that my customers would yell at me either way, but I made the call that you would yell at me more for charging $1.20 for peppers on the side as opposed to providing them at no additional cost by putting them either on or off, not on the side\" Hope this clears it up for you bro, Jimmy  Heather      Heather  Doesn't make any sense on 2 points  1 Let the customer have it they ways they like it ( The juice from the hot peppers end up drenching into the sandwich and it tastes like a hot vinegar sandwich) 2 Consistency.... All operations should be a mirror image of each other.   You might think I am being petty on this but when I go into a eating establishment I want it my way. If I asked for my mayo or oil & vinegar on the side it is not allowed even if I offer to pay extra? I know food establishments are working on thin margins and I realize that extra condiments cut into the bottom line. But if  a customer offers  to \" pay extra \" and it is not allowed it does not make any sense.  If JJ had charged me 50 to 75 cents more for my request it would have been pure profit. Please help me understand why JJ has made this decision when a customer offers to pay extra.........     From: JJ Feedback [mailto:jimmyjohn@jimmyjohns.com]  Subject: RE: Jimmy Johns Feedback Form Submission  Tom  Thank you for taking the time to write.  The information you received is correct, our corporate locations no longer offer peppers on the side.  You can either have the peppers on your sandwich or not at all.  Please note that it is up to the other franchisees whether or not to follow suit so you may find locations near you that do still offer them as a side item.  Hopefully this helps.

{"text":"I have ordered from this location many times.  My experience has been very good.  My subs have always  arrived within the time window I chose and the subs have tasted very fresh.  I will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"If I could give them Zero stars I would.  I am not sure who the franchise manager is, but I am certain they hires felons on parole.  Nothing is ever made correctly, the service is slow, and each time I have received my sandwich back I have to rebuild it.  I will never return to this location again.  Corporate should honestly monitor this location."}
{"text":"There sandwiches are always delicious the staff is super friendly and delivery is fast thank you for such excellent food and service"}
{"text":"Don't bother ordering delivery from this place. At least on the weekend. Made an order while I was cleaning my house for a simple sandwich and chips. Included a tip in my order. After an hour I called and was told they voided it with no explanation. They didn't know why and I certainly didn't either. Manager told me he'd get it out to me \"right away\" had to play phone tag for another hour I received me sandwich in just under two hours!!!!! No real explanation for what was going on. They did ask if i would want anything extra for free on the last phone call before they left the store FINALLY but at that point I was under the impression my sandwich had already left the store. At that point I just wanted my sandwich and never to order from them again. When the sandwich came it was pretty scanty compared to what I'm used to at other locations. Adios Jimmy John's!!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite sandwich shop! Their bread is fresh, soft , and delicious. You can tell all their ingredients are fresh. If you like subway (I'm not a fan) then you will love and appreciate Jimmy John's. Also their chips are great too!! Can't wait to try other sandwiches"}
{"text":"I was in a hurry to get to an appointment so wanted something quick. Food was fast and good but staff appeared to make fun of me as I left saying, \"Thanks for the beautiful smile\". Being in a hurry had getting to my appointment on my mind and probably did not show a lovely smile but I thought the snarky attitude was uncalled for. I also think they tried to make me feel stupid because I didnt know that the slim sandwich could not have mayonnaise on it."}
{"text":"They are so friekin fast . I m not a fan of deli but I ordered when I was pregnant and sick and I felt like I hung up the phone and they were at the door."}

{"text":"I have developed recurring cravings now for their Big John sandwich (salty roast beef, yummy bun, great mayo... YUM), so I frequent their shop on Grant Street when I have an audition in the city or an appointment after work.   If you'd like to go when absolutely no other customers are there, 6pm is a pretty good time. They're open late (9pm, I believe) even though their neighbors often close early, given that the business crowd has gone home to families.   One curious thing about the chain (not particularly this one location) is that they don't offer a 'toasted' option. I'm aware it's because their gimmick is \"fast\", but I'd salvage 90 more seconds of my time to have a warm sandwich. I couldn't believe they survived competition when they handed me a cold-cut sandwich... though it is a DARN good cold-cut sandwich."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Finally a quick service sub shop that puts ample meats on the sandwich for a price comprable to Subway and Quiznos.  Great value, in and out in 5 minutes.  Blows Subway and Quiznos out of the water"}
{"text":"Don't believe the commercials when it comes to this place.  Waited over 90 minutes for my sandwich today.  I called after an hour and the guy on the phone was a real punk a$$.  If you can't get a sandwich delivered two miles in an hour and a half, at least don't be a jerk when I call to find out what's up."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time to this location. The 1st time was yesterday and dined in and thought the flavor was good and better than the other sandwich chains. So today I came back to pick up 3 sandwiches for my family. Service was very slow but at least the cashier apologized for my wait. When they called my order I asked for a bag and another employee said \" they are right there pointing to the bags on the other side of the counter. The manager was standing right there so I said to him \" Oh, you have to bag your own\" and he replied \"Yeah\".  Now I don't mind bagging my own order but don't be rude and expect your customers to know especially when the bags and napkins are on the other side of the counter.  Food is good,  value is fair and customer service is below par."}
{"text":"I went to this location and the staff was amazing.  I am eating clean and I wanted an healthier option.  The entire staff were involved in helping me choose wat sandwiches would be a better choice.  I love excellent!  Customer service."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a sandwich person, but I must admit this place is great. The whole grain bread is to die for. A carbohydrate actually worth eating. I had the turkey and ham. It has healthy meat portions and the rest of the items on in were perfect amounts in relationship. Lots of food. I could only eat half. Definitely ask for it on the whole grain bread."}
{"text":"Wow I was shock Toinght I went to eat I order roast beff sub and order cup of water he that i was poring lemonade ,the manager of store David Gibson came and threw my cups of water in trash, such bad service I would not recommend anyone to eat there there service is so bad and mean manager i ask him to give me My money back after he throw my drink in trash he said no  and he was going to call Cops Police on me for no Reason what a jerk!!!"}
{"text":"The food was okay but they don't serve sprouts, even though it's on their menu.    The service is really horrible though and we will not being going back.  The employees, act like they are doing you a service by doing their jobs.  However, they should realize that there are other sub places and if enough people leave, they will be out of a job.  I guess crappy attitudes are part and parcel of hiring a bunch of kids."}
{"text":"Worst location to stop at, there is an older lady with red hair who harasses my mom every time she goes in there and today she harassed me for not having the same last name as my mom then proceeded to give me attitude while I was waiting for my sandwich.. I will never go to this place again unless corrective action is taken."}
{"text":"I work 8 am to 6pm Monday thru Saturday with no lunch break. Constantly busy, so when I need food, I need it in a timely manner. These guys always seem to pull through, I call there and they already know my name and address from previous orders, and they are definitely always \"freaky fast\" for me. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Got my sandwich delivered to me, and the guy got here quick. He met me downstairs, I felt bad for him because it was raining out. I recommend them whole-heartedly!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, this place is fast. I go there when I'm around U of I campus. They finish the sandwich about the same time as you get to the pick-up end of the counter. That's fast. They're pretty friendly, too - although a bit LOUD."}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  Normally I do enjoy jimmy johns italian nightclub sandwich, however I went in for lunch today and asked to try a small sample of tuna salad as I need to avoid deli meat( I told them I was pregnant and need to avoid cold deli meats for listeria purposes).  3 different employees said no, we don't allow samples of anything.  So I asked if I did buy the tuna salad and did not like it, if I could exchange for the vegetarian instead.... and again told no.  Went to Whole Foods next door, where they do allow samples of their food and gave my money to them instead. How hard is it to put a small sample of pre-made tuna salad on a spoon to satisfy the customer and ensure a sale?  Also, they do not heat their subs!"}
{"text":"Visited this location March 2014 during First Friday Art Walk, missed the sign on the door & did not learn until after I'd received my food that restrooms were closed.  Employees would not budge when I suggested that as a paying customer I should be able to use the restroom, was told that it was out of their hands, regional manager had told them to shut restrooms down so all the people out for art walk would not wander in just to use restrooms. Understand their frustration with being used for public restroom, but hey, it's one night & probably brings a lot of extra business in.  Seems that a business would want to support a community event like First Friday & people do have to go somewhere.  Very disappointing.   Very mean spirited."}
{"text":"Great people at this store.  They donated a great food platter to Sozo Community Church for their Haircuts for the Homeless event. Please support those that support our local community."}
{"text":"I would give them 0 stars.  They had loud rap music on & every 3rd would was a swear word or sexually explicit.  Asked the young cashier girl if they could turn it off since there were children in the business.  She said only the mananger could since he put it on.  Of course she kept standing there and didn't even inform him of my concerns.  Another customer asked for napkins & she gave him an attitude about them being on the condiment counter.  When he & I looked their weren't any there.  At this point she made a rude comment & threw some on the counter.  I ended up leaving without receiving my food, just couldn't take the music or attitude any longer."}
{"text":"Very fast delivery, good sandwiches. I was called within 5 minutes of ordering and offered free chips because there was a longer wait than normal."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's! It is a simple sub shop going back to the basics! Fresh delicious bread, cold cuts, 1 cheese (provolone), and the basic toppings. None of these crazy flavors. No toasted sandwiches. 100% old school and I love it!  I lived in the University area for a while so I am use to the Jimmy John's being open until 2am but I just found out it is just that location that stays open the late. This particular location has no inside seating to be prepared to get back in your car. The good thing is that they do deliver. And it's just like the commercial says \"Freaky fast, Freaky good\"!"}
{"text":"unimpressed....ordered a club sandwich, forgot the lettuce, soggy bacon, no avocado, slathered with mayo....havent been back, wont go back"}
{"text":"Extremely rude service. The man behind the counter would not work with me to make the sandwich the way I had been ordering it for the past few times I've been there. When asked how long ago they stopped making special orders, he quickly remarked, \"for as long as Jimmy Johns has been established\". I told him I would not be back, and he did not seem to care in the least. Would not recommend this service to anyone."}
{"text":"Wow. Just picked up the three subs I ordered for dinner and the turkey sub I ordered had no turkey. How do you make a turkey sub without the turkey....seriously? The manager offered a free sub that I could go pick up or use at another time.  When I asked if they would deliver it since I had just arrived at home, he said that wasn't an option."}
{"text":"Good food but lousy service. I had delivery delivered 4 times from this location before being told that I was exactly 2 houses outside their delivery area and that all previous deliveries had been \"mistakes\".  Therefor they get 1 star for making 1 major mistake or 4 minor \"mistakes\"."}
{"text":"Ordered online at 10:23 am. They were at my door at 10:35 am. WOW! That's impressive. I added a bunch of the freebies to my sub too... it was all correct.  I will definitely be calling back!  And... I just priced out making the Gargatuan sub at home. It comes to $13.00 +. I would love to see some of the previous posters make this sub on their own... talk about a sub not worth eating lol."}
{"text":"Oh Jimmy Johns where have you been? I used to eat Jimmy Johns almost every other day in  college.  And I never want to make the trek down to Tempe to get you.  You are by far one of my favorite places to eat.  You trump Subway and Quizno's every single time.    Every time I go I am never disappointed, the only thing I wish would be different is that I would order two sandwiches instead of one.  OK, but really.  This is an awesome place to get a quick bite to eat.  I love the sandwiches, have never had a bad one.  My all time favorite is the Club LuLu.  Turkey, Bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo.  It's simple, but it's the best.    Oh and always put jalapeño chips on your sandwich. It makes it that much better.    So glad that they opened a Scottsdale location, it's close to work, easy to get to.  Only thing you have to worry about is finding a seat because the place is tiny.  I'm not really sure where I ate in Scottsdale before Jimmy Johns.... Did I even eat?"}
{"text":"I order food from here about once a month.  They are always very fast to deliver and I have never been disappointed by a sandwich.  I have ordered online and recieved my food 8 minutes later! I have seen delivery drivers run out of the store to go on deliveries."}
{"text":"talk about a rip-off!!!  $8 for an 8\" piece of sh**!  no chips, one measly thinly sliced pc of cheese, could hardly see the meat (supposed turkey & ham) and the bun was soooooo tough i doubt u could've cut it w/a knife.  other sam bought was supposed to be roast beef (which, again you could hardly identify as meat), but lots & lots of garbage called iceberg.  wouldn't waste my time again after bugging and bugging my sister to eat there - embarrassed!!!!  subway puts them to shame...."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. The guy acted like we were doing him a disservice by coming in. He had a backpack on and was slamming the drawer when we paid. He cut my pickle into two very disproportionate slices before he got on his bike and left. Compared to other Jimmy John's it was also dirty. They had a mop bucket sitting right out in the open with dirty mop water in it. No welcome either. Won't go back to that location."}
{"text":"I get delivery from this Jimmy Johns quite often. They are usually fast and I haven't had a problem with the food until tonight. The bread was stale. It was so hard we could barely bite into it. I ended up just eating the inside. If I wanted that then I wouldn't have ordered a sandwich. I called them to let them know and was told a manager would call me back right away. I never received a phone call back. I am extremely disappointed. If this is how they are going to treat their regular customers then I may go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have ordered thru them (Jimmy  Johns) many times, granted their food is good, today I simply said there is no mayo packs in my bag and she proceeded to act like I was lying, she (TJ Jones) said she put them in the bag personally, we argued because I was insulted by her words and I was felt like I was called a liar....I'm done with them, there are better ways I can make my own sandwich without the cost.......get a job you like, TJ Jones. By the way she said she is a manager, doubt it and if so I'm really running away. Almost $15 delivery sandwich and chips..expect better service....also if anyone cares real Mgr (hopefully is) Brianna 602-460-1740 thx for your time."}
{"text":"Just as it was before, rude service ....and the same person is there...now your paying 10 bucks an hour, where is the customer service. I was refused service because she didnt hear...was rude about it...is this the tv show?  my friends will not be joining you...went to Paradise cafe  with open arms....never will I go to Jimmy Johns again....In the parking lot a girl who was upset we both backed out quickly....you need to change your operation its not about all the money..."}
{"text":"1 hour delivery wait for me tonight NEVER faster than 45 minutes on all other orders.. Safe to say I'm done with Jimmy Johns. Freaky Slow Delivery......"}
{"text":"UPDATE  After another bad experience with them, having to chase my driver across campus, the owner called me and handled the situation very nicely.  I was not out for free food or anything he just seemed to really want to make the situation right.  To me that is what matters a little more than something bad happening on a visit.  Thanks Bo!"}
{"text":"Been to other jimmy johns and had great experience but this location sucks. Took a family friend who was a first timer and she was very disappointed. The staff was rude and she did not get a complete sandwich. I took the sandwich to the manager who was young and he called his manager David who stated nothing can be done for her as she ate some of the sandwich. I just wanted them to put tuna on the other half of the sandwich but they said they could not do nothing for her. I will not be returning to jimmy johns due to the way they treat seniors and being rude and disrespectful. The manager David did tell his manager to tell me I can complain on the website. I can call the gm Austin but have a feeling I will get the same disrespect. What a disappointment. Not a way to treat people especially seniors."}
{"text":"The bootlegger is the best sandwich, I crave it's perfection. Super fast and friendly staff no matter what location I go to!"}
{"text":"I noticed that a new Jimmy John's had opened on Hayden in McCormick Ranch.  I am a sandwich fan, and had heard about Jimmy John's for several years, but had never been able to stop and try one. So since it was close, I decided to see why everybody was recommending them.  It wasn't busy when I arrived, so I was able to ask some questions, and take my time deciding what I wanted.    I ordered a Vito, which is essentially an 8\" Italian sub.  I was impressed - not only was it fresh, but the bread was delicious.  The only thing that I was disappointed with was that it was not as filling as I expected. Now when I go, I order of the \"Giant\" side of the menu, and it is just right.  Great sandwich shop, and one of my regular stops on my way home from golf."}
{"text":"The food AND the people here were great! Love the grainy bread loaded with tasty ingredients. The people were fast, friendly and fun, a rarity in today's fast food places"}
{"text":"Went in right when the bread was made. Got the beach sub, it was really good. A little pricey for a sandwich though. $8."}
{"text":"Love this place! I will choose JJ's over Subway any day. Everything is a better quality and I love that the tomatoes are always fresh."}
{"text":"Seems like from the reviews, they need some staff rearrangement- as I've equally had a horrible experience. Went there on a Saturday, completely empty-one guy behind the counter. Besides not being greeted he finished what he was doing and came to ring me up finally. Got a sandwich and starving I ran home. I bite into my Vito and what a surprise, but plastic everywhere inside my sandwich. Shredded, plastic. I called and freaked out a bit, that could hurt someone and is disgusting on top of it. So in light that this location made my experience dangerous, I'll never return to a JJ's again after being a long time customer.  When I called the girl that anSwered quickly handed off the phone to someone else, who couldn't find my order to void out-and I had to wait another 10 minutes starving for my refund. What a joke. Grow up and do your job."}
{"text":"Went there tonight and there were two employees working. They were both so nice and welcoming and hooked me up with the most beautiful sub ever. I got the Italian night club with hot peppers extra meat and it was the best thing ah. Thank you keep doing what you're doing"}
{"text":"My friend insisted on going in here to grab a quick sandwich.  The signage sucked so I already assumed the food would be nearly about as bad as it was, but never imagined it would be even worse than could possibly be imagined. Think Subway, but cutting even more costs and using day old cut veggies and grade D meats.  One bite of my friend's sandwich and  it was apparent this establishment is run by someone who has no regard whatsoever for quality (gourmet! hahaha!!!) nor his customer's health.   Jimmy John, you are a money grubbing pig of a man. You should be ashamed of yourself, and if you believe in hell, I hope you then believe that's where you'll end up for trading such bottom of the barrel filth, for people's, often times, hard earned money.  Don't go here if you have tastebuds or any regard for your body at all"}
{"text":"I want to give props to Josh at this location. He's very much invested in customer service and would like to thank him for making my experience a good one!"}
{"text":"Took 3 remakes to get my sandwich right. The last one was wrong too so i just asked for a plastic fork to remove the tomatoes myself. They dont have utensils and i had to use a napkin.  Nothing special and not much to offer. Sandwich was almost hollow on the inside.for the money go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Service is sooo slow!!!!! How many people does take to make 1 sandwich?! I waited 15 min for 1 sandwich and I was the only person in the place. Hopefully with time service will get much faster!"}
{"text":"Over the years, I've watched while the prices have risen steadily, including a very sharp increase right about the time Jimmy John started building that obscene house of his.  Hmmmmm.... I wonder if there's a connection....  Meanwhile, quality and quantity of ingredients has declined substantially.  What was once my favorite place to grab a sandwich isn't even on my list anymore.  Kinda sad.  I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewer who complained about the avocado.  The most insulting part of it is that they charge something ridiculous like $1.00 (a huge amount when compared to the total cost of the sandwich) to add extra avocado.  In my experience, even if you pay for extra, there's still not enough on there to actually taste it.  Paradiso is located in the same building as the JJ's on Lincoln, and is a MUCH better sandwich for about the same price.  I'd recommend going there instead."}
{"text":"How could I NOT have reviewed JJ's yet?! I freaking LOVE this place! I originally popped my proverbial Jimmy John's cherry in St Louis, then was able to enjoy them yet again in Chanhassen, MN...then Brookfield, WI...but why oh why didn't the Phoenix area have it?!? Why did I need to jump a plane to get my Jimmy John's fix?!? Then, thank GOD, I was driving along Elliot and stumbled upon them!! They've now opened a slew of them throughout the East Valley-primarily in Tempe near ASU, go figure.   If you've never been before, there's a couple different sizes...slims ($3.50), 8\" subs ($4.50), and GIANT club sandwiches ($5.50). Then, in a category all to itself, the JJ Gargantuan ($7.50). These guys know how to make a sub...and fast! (Their slogan is Subs so fast you'll freak!) Everything is super fresh, not like Subway with their day old tomatoes and wilted lettuce (bleck!). JJ's does it different-they give you the option to make your sandwich an 'unwich'-basically what you order in a lettuce wrap for all you carb-aphobics out there. I've ordered quite a few different subs and all have exceeded my expectations-my FAVES are the #5 Vito and the #9 Italian Night Club both with hot peppers!   These guys cater AND deliver.  If you're in the area, definitely give this place a try-they dont disappoint!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical when I kept hearing how amazing Jimmy John's is.  So I went in, and found my new favorite sandwich spot!  The inside was very noisey, but I liked the atmosphere.  The bread had an awesome fresh taste, and when I inquired about the difference between 2 sandwiches, the cashier was very helpful."}
{"text":"Super impressed with the speed of delivery and quality of the food. I was super hungry at work and just yelped Delivery. Super easy to order online and got here fast. Definitly ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Despite their badass self-image, their sandwiches are anything but badass.  The service and sorry sandwiches at this place made me wonder if they'd just started.  Nope, the chain / franchise company has been around for almost as long as Subway, but with, what, 1% as many franchises?  Short example: order a \"Gourmet Veggie Club\".  On the menu, \"real avocado spread\" is the second ingredient.  Try to see if you can find it.  Avocados are delicious and expensive, so you wanna taste it, right?  It's not going to happen.  When I took the sandwich to the counter to ask why all the ingredients weren't there, they showed me how two pieces of cheese were stuck together with a thin film of guac.  Hello, what is this?  There's more mayo (last ingredient listed) than guac in the sandwich.  But, the response was that that was the precise amount they were supposed to include.  Badass sandwiches?  Try sorry ass sandwiches.  For bad attitude, bad quality, and bad prices, there's no place like Jimmy John's Garbage Sandwiches.  Footnote: JJ is based in Champaign.  This makes me leary of visiting a franchise in any other city, if this store is so bad and so close to home."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and freaking fast. Love the beach club and Italian night club and their chips!!!"}
{"text":"Asked for a turkey sandwich. . They didn't put cheese on it i asked for mayo and mustard i wanted dijon but they gave me yellow mustard .."}
{"text":"Very fast service and the bead is fresh. Always enjoy the sandwiches and high energy with this place. Located in the las vegas city hall with curb access."}
{"text":"This evening I watched an Air Force gentleman come in order his sub and the young lady working there thanked him for his service and paid for his sub out of her own pocket. Glad to see there are still good people in this world. She deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"Service is really fast.  Restaurant was very clean.  I thought the food was just adequate.  My husband loves Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"I was just at this location about ten minutes ago and I have never been so appalled by someone who is in customer service in my life. I will never go there again. My girlfriend and I went in there to buy a sandwich because she was drunk and needed food. One of your workers proceeded to feciciously ridicule her and have a condescending meaner and that is NOT okay. . He snickered and was sarcastic the entire time and refused to tell us his name. He said, \"haha, you know I don't have to tell you that.\" He was short haired, a stubble beard with a gingerish hair color.  His coworker on his opposite side though with the long hair was extremely apologetic and nice. But because of that other jerk I will never be visiting this jimmy johns again. It's one thing to make fun of a customer behind their backs but to their face is unacceptable."}
{"text":"I shouldn't have to ask for fresh bread That's what I was told by the supervisor when I told him 2 previous orders, my bread was hard"}
{"text":"I love going here with my husband we always get the #9 with hot peppers and it's always super delicious. Today I kind of had a bad experience they forgot my hot peppers but I didn't say anything. Then, when we sat down I got really cold and asked them if they could turn the fan off and they said that they can't because they don't know how and corporate does that which I was totally okay with. In the end I saw a guy come pick up sandwiches that were the full length not cut in half and I wanted one so I asked the guy if they do sandwiches that big and he said they do and explained this day old bread thing and I wanted one but a fresh one and the lady said they can't do that that I would have to buy two and they would cut it in half. Way to make me feel awkward guys, if the sandwich wasn't so delicious I wouldn't go back ever again :/"}
{"text":"I understand that sometimes people have bad days but this experience was not to be believed! When I got to the drive up the person taking the order was very curt. I didn't think much of it until I got to the window to pay. The bill was $8.18 I handed her what I thought was $20.18. She was counting change and I said I gave you .18 and she said no it was .17. I immediately went to give her another penny. With attitude she said I didn't tell you because people want change like that. She handed me $8 and I said I think this is wrong. How much was the sandwich? She proceeded to tell me you got the receipt you look it up! At this moment I asked for the manager and she told me she was!!! I then asked her name and she refused to give it to me. She gave me the $4 and turned to the other employees who were looking at her and said I didn't do anything wrong! There are way too many sandwich shops in this center for me to be patronizing this one!"}
{"text":"They have Jimmy Johns in Phoenix? Why am I the last to know this? Now if they could only get one in north Phoenix, instead of all down in Tempe... if you want to know what I think of Jimmy John's, see my other review of the one in Champaign, IL.  I'm so happy they are finally here!"}
{"text":"My second stop on my Champaign food tour was to pick up Jimmy Johns on the way to the hospital.  I needed something that I could take into my Mom's hospital room (which ruled out Papa Del's) so I stopped by this Jimmy Johns.  I was in and out in about 2 minutes, with a delicious sub in my hand.  What makes these subs so good is the bread... the best I've ever had at a sub shop.   They do really pile on the mayo though, but that's part of JJ's experience... 100 x better than Subway!  I wish they had a Jimmy John's in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff! Brianne dropped off subs to our entire office staff, subs were fresh and delicious, Thank you! The new location is in very close proximity to our office which is super convenient and delivery is super fast!"}
{"text":"I've been to some lousy chain restaurants but this place is in a league of its own when it comes to service. I ordered a turkey sandwich and asked to have mustard put on it. They forgot to put mustard on it and I was told they dont put mustard on the sandwiches and was handed three packets of mustard. This place also won't give you napkins unless you ask."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to order lunch from during the work week. To be clear: Their delivery people are disrespectfully fast. I have ordered two sandwiches, hung up the phone, and had a delivery person waiting for me in less than 5 minutes. If you want to witness this behavior yourself, I suggest you eat in. There are delivery drivers literally running in and out of the place like somebody dropped it in the middle of an olympic relay race.  As for the food - it's exactly Jimmy John's. Good sandwiches, with the focus probably being their unique bread. It's not fancy, but it gives them their signature taste. The ingredients are always fresh, and as I said - unreasonably fast."}
{"text":"Don't understand why they don't deliver to St. Luke's hospital?!?! It's right down the street?!?!? Laziness!!!"}
{"text":"If you like lettuce sandwiches for $8 this is the place for you. The sandwich came with 2 thin slices of turkey, lots of lettuce, 2 thin slices of tomato. I thought I was being punked. Never again."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Just wish that it had more variety for vegetarians, but I love how fast they deliver and ordering online is Great!  As far as service goes they are suburb! They have it down and really know shat they are doing!"}
{"text":"This was such a mediocre Jimmy Johns.  Our sandwiches came out dry and mostly just lettuce.  I ordered the Vito and there was barely any meat on there. I have had much better sandwiches at subway which is saying a lot because subway is terrible."}
{"text":"Not freaky fast but freaky good! Lol i live Uptown and it always take 45 min or more to get my order.. however my order is always correct and yummy!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a quick sandwich.  It's the default place to go when i can't pick anything. The staff is super friendly and the service is pretty fast."}
{"text":"What is up with their bread?! It's papery slick and weirdly dry it's like eating the weekly ads! Great cookies though!"}
{"text":"Doing drug deals at night with occasional employees and passerby is something management should look into, freaky fast."}
{"text":"Buy a sandwich! Ask for a water cup! If they charge you 27 cents return your sandwich! This is the worst customer service I've ever had at Jimmy Johns. Will never eat there again."}
{"text":"I have been to many Jimmy Johns, and have always been pleased; however, today was an entirely different experience to say the least.  It was my first time trying the new location on Tatum and Cactus, near PV mall.  After making my order, I noticed the employee woman sneezing twice all over the meat/cheese slicer... with no attempt at all to cover the nasal spray.  NASTY.  After waiting a few moments to see if she was going to clean the machine, which she did not, I mentioned it to another employee.  She said that the woman who sneezed was the manager and that sometimes you cannot help it.  While I agree that you cannot help sneezing, my daughter has known to use her\"germ catcher\" when she sneezes to at least attempt to stop the spread of dangerous germs/bacteria since she was 3.  Anyway, after I complained the woman walked away nodding her head in disapproval of my complaint?  To make it worse, they were very rude/sarcastic as I walked out saying,\"Enjoy!\"  I will never return to this location and i strongly suggest that you do not either."}
{"text":"Walking in the vibe was off and weird. I stood at the counter deciding on what I wanted and when I was ready no one was there to take my order, everyone walked away. When someone did come up to ask if I was ready I said yes and she looked at me weird, it got awkward until I took the hint and moved over to her register. Once there I felt like I was being rushed in explaining my order, when it was time to pay I swiped my card, but the machine wasn't working properly. The cashier made me feel as if it were my fault by telling me that I was doing it wrong and that I needed to swipe it correctly. She the took my card and swiped it herself. After it was clear that the damage didn't come from my end she got the manager to help, I paid for my food, was given my sandwich and just stared at. No, \"thank you\" or \"have a nice day\". Went to get a straw and couldn't find them, I asked where they were after a good minute of looking and was told with so much attitude it threw me off. I almost wanted to just take my food to go. I sat down and started eating and noticed that the bread at the bottom of my sandwich was hard, I asked that it be fixed and while the manager was accommodating the employees seemed like I was burdening them. I got my sandwich remade(bread still was hard and over cooked) and left."}
{"text":"Loved the service like all the Jimmy John's I have gone to. I have been to places in Vegas and St. Paul, but this one is the best so far. Fast service, very clean, nice and big, last but not least amazing sandwiches!!!  I had the club lulu with hot peppers!! BOOM!!!! It was great!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and great location and appr ciat how they are close to bars . Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This store has no consistency and they don't care about doing the little things or follow systems and procedures 100%. Shape up"}
{"text":"I love this place so much!! They're always super cool and sweet! And super speedy delivery!"}
{"text":"Great fresh ingredients high quality meats and cheeses. A great place to get food fast and easy. If you're short on time but don't want to sacrifice quality Jimmy John's is the place to go."}
{"text":"I'm at this Jimmy John's often since I have to travel to Charlotte for business. Love the place. Only complaint is that they don't always put enough mayo on the sandwiches. Definitately come after 1 oclock when its less busy. Yo Ron!"}
{"text":"As a visitor from out of town we were planning to eat at another establishment a few doors down but really wanted to try something else. We were greeted by friendly employees and fast service.  Our meal was just right! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I created my account finally just to make note that this location is one mile away from the hotel I'm staying at (downtown Phoenix across from u.s. Airways center and it's \"not in their delivery range\".   Between that and the other location that closes at 5:00 on friday and Saturday I'm not really sure how jimmy johns stays in business"}
{"text":"I quit going there, my manager did not.  He came back from JJ's, looked in his bag and started shaking his head.  He had asked for mustard and mayonnaise packets.  Guess what wasn't in the bag?  \"They can't get anything right.  It was a simply request.  You'd think with 20 people working back there they might get something right\".  I no longer patronize this establishment, they have proven beyond any measure of doubt that their employees could care less about whether they get your order right or not."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns gets an F-minus. The \"freaky-fast\" service is too fast - meaning they frequently screw up my orders and don't give me what I want as far as extras on my sandwiches or they put something on there I didn't ask for and didn't want.  There are WAY too many people in that line-assembly back there, which is why I am guessing there must be confusion and therefore orders are not prepared as the customer has asked.  But even much lamer is their corporate policy to NOT give you bags or napkins.  They don't even offer them to you! There are no napkins to be found anywhere in the store except \"hiding behind the counter\".  A corporate person today said that you are more than welcomed to reach over the counter and grab some if you need them.   What kind of messed up minds would actually make it a POLICY to not give out napkins? Sound petty? It IS petty, but the pettiness is on them!    I'll give them kudos for the delicious bread, but the number of times my orders have been messed up? And their stupid napkin policy?  1 star may be too many for them.  I'll agree with another reviewer, too, about the menu being up on the ceiling.  This place seems to be more about how fast and cheap they can do things and not about customer service."}
{"text":"Me and my wife stumbled across this wonderful sub shop on our way through to florida, the restaurant was very clean, the employees extremely helpful and they were very well versed in there menu... I highly recommend this place for a quick healthy, tasty and reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"If their customer service would have been better. I could have stretched a 3 star. But... I started with the Vito. The bread was soft but had no taste which in most cases is OK because the taste should come from the meats/cheese/etc. But even with deli meats, my pallet was barely moved. I probably shouldn't have had one so close to a Subway deli trio, cuz I had one the night before. I initially introduced myself as a first timer, and I wanted to know about the ordering process. The order-taker kind of expected me to know what I'm doing. But when he got around to explaining I ended up having to view the menu board myself. I should add that the guy folded his arms on top of his register screen and leaned over it as if his job was back-breaking.  Aside from him, one other order taker, two delivery persons, and maybe 4 sandwich makers, I would expect everyone to be on top of their game. But customer service was a department they don't have. The only positive thing I observed is that my sandwich was ready in seconds. But even then, I had to bag it myself with the rest of my over-priced combo."}
{"text":"I've been eating Jimmy John's for 20 years and it doesn't get much better than this!!"}
{"text":"Funny story! I was in the ER after a bad fall   and several other people and I had waited many hours. We were still not even in rooms because they were so buisey. So a few of us were hungry and ordered Jimmy John's. And they delivered right to this ER waiting room. Best Turkey Tom I have ever had. And we all appreciated at least Jimmy John's being fast that night. They got us our food in less than five minutes!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Took 45 minutes for them to deliver. Would not recommend, especially if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite jimmy johns, thanks to two of its wonderful employees Greg and Myles. They made my sandwiches freaky fast and their customer service was amazing, I was only there for a short time but I had a blast! I will definitely be returning to this jimmy johns and will recommend it to all my friends in the area!! Great job!!!!!"}
{"text":"Less than one star!! Actually a minus 25! I ordered a Veggie Sandwich was overcharged, and given a Roast Beef! I questioned the gal at the window, and she insisted it was the right sandwich. Went back to get a refund and the manager REFUSED to give me my cash back! Said he would need my phone number to text a credit or remake the sandwich. I told him I did not trust him to do either! He kept my money, and the sandwich. I had to call corporate twice to finally make them give me my cash back. They wanted me to drive to their corporate office or have a check mailed. The district manager still has not called me. It took me over 5 hrs to get my money back, but this treatment was unreal.   On another visit, the music  was so incredibly loud  that we asked for it to be turned down so I could hear my husband, who was right next to me. This same manager says \"Corporate doesn't allow him to turn it any lower!\"   Horrible customer service!!!! Jimmy should stick with a delivery hut, and just send out sandwiches.   Jimmy John's will NEVER get business from me, again! Gross food and bad customer service you can get anywhere."}
{"text":"I have loved jimmy john's for about 10 years now and consistently ordered from there in 3 different states that I've lived in. I work a couple blocks down and order from there about once a week. Average wait time is at least a half hour. They NEVER give me napkins. This is small.. but very annoying. To top it off their sandwiches just aren't what I'm used to from jimmy johns. The meat never tastes right. Anyways. I just ordered my last sub from there. It's a sad day"}
{"text":"This place is the best. This is a weekly staple in my house! The bread and ingredients are always fresh. Good grub, I perfer it over subway any day!"}
{"text":"This store refuses to serve free water with a meal. I have been here twice in the last week and they would not give me water. They actually charge 27 cents for a water cup. I had to record them denying me water in order for them to give me water. Extremely petty. Not sure if it's even legal. I will never go back here again on principle alone."}
{"text":"Man, worst sandwiches ever. I'd rather eat out of a dumpster. The roast beef was green. Bread was soggy. It gave me the runs"}
{"text":"If you've never been to a Jimmy John's, you probably hate fast and fresh sandwiches.    This location is even better than every other JJs I've been to.  It has a drive-thu!  Seriously!  I'll bet it took me less than two minutes to order, get my food, and drive away.  If you love sandwiches, you have to love JJs...it really is the go-to.   Try:  The Italian Night Club  Avoid:  Forgetting to ask for the hot peppers"}
{"text":"Super fast service with out fail. I order delivery from here regularly. Unlike most delivery places they get it to you FAST (when you are just barely hungry) instead of EVENTUALLY (when you are ready to commit murder in the name of food). The store front is always clean and quick as well. Great place."}
{"text":"5/25/17 Ran late, ordered on line again.  1 hr went by no order, checked by bank act, they charged my card-then canceled the order and reversed the charge.  I called the manager and explained, he literally said its not our fault maybe you have NSF, I re-explained they charged me then canceled it, he said oh well.  I said I've had such bad experiences Ill definitely not ordering from you guys any more and our office orders A LOT (over 100 people in this office alone), the \"MANAGERS\" response, OK BYE and hung up.  CRAP food, CRAP management, CRAP CRAP CRAP- NEVER AGAIN!  This time, I filed a complaint with the company directly.  Bad business, bad management, poor service, lack of qualify of food preparation. BOOOO!"}
{"text":"dont order from this jj's.  slow delivery poor customer. rude and unprofessional managers."}
{"text":"\"My 3rd Yelp review:  A Jimmy John's Installment.\"  Delicious.  Fast.  Cheap.  I'm not a huge mayo fan, but get something WITH mayo.  Avoid the sprouts.  Actually, just steer clear of sprouts altogether (unless you are a hippy, hippies love sprouts) .    Please open a JJ's in San Diego!!!  -THE END"}
{"text":"Do not deliver from them. Used to be superfast now now each simple order takes over an hour!!!! It,s simple cold sandwiches, not haute cuisine.."}
{"text":"Just tried to order a sandwich and I'm 2.5 miles away and they say I'm not in their area.    Not cool Jimmy Johns..  Not cool.."}
{"text":"Just ordered my sub and asked for my hot peppers on the side.  Was told they couldn't and the reason is \"it's against company policy\".  What?? They done me wrong and won't go back."}
{"text":"I order from this location and another near my work all the time. Same order every time; this delivery was DISGUSTINGLY SOGGY!!! They also gave me the wrong flavor chips. Makes me wonder if they just threw together someone else's abandoned order? What I Do know is I'm going on an anti-jimmy's diet for a while after that tragic mess"}
{"text":"Yup, they messed up my online order. I ordered one Gargantuan and one Beach Club. I get the food home to find they gave me two Beach Clubs. The Club is $6 something and the Gargantuan is $9 something....they owe me $3!"}
{"text":"I really can't find much to complain about.  They always make my sammich the way I want it - substitute 7 grain bread and light mayo.  Service is always quick, probably because there are always about 15 people behind the counter.  I have no idea how this place is profitable paying all those employees but whatever.  Half of them look stoned too, but there are enough of them who seem semi-conscious enough to churn out subs at a rapid pace.  It's a weird space that used to be a bank I think.  Tables are nice and clean though so it's all good.  So they've got 5 stars for now... However if their recent credit card info breach affects me in any way I will be chopping stars like a madman.. you've been warned James Jonathan!"}
{"text":"At $10.50 plus tax for the Gargantuan sandwich, I will no longer be buying them. Although it is a good sandwich, it is not worth $11.00"}
{"text":"I have not eaten in at Jimmy Johns, but have done take out from them several times.  I love how fast they are.  One time I stopped in and by the time I got back to the  car, the same song was on!  The sandwich I get (#12, Beach Club), is DELICIOUS and it's great! I have one problem, however -- a few weeks ago, JJ came to my work (Surprise Elementary in El Mirage) and delivered samples for the teachers, which was wonderful!  A few weeks after that, my coworkers called there to order sandwiches for delivery for my birthday.  My school is on the border of Surprise and El Mirage, and we were told that since we were on the wrong side of greenway, they could not deliver to us.  As teachers, we don't have the time to go out for lunch, and since we were right on the border, it would've been nice if they could've delivered - i mean, why send us samples when you then won't come to us?"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here. Next to Blimpies, which I can't really find out here, this is the place for quality meats and lightning fast service. Delivery will be at your home in 10 min flat. Value is an A+."}
{"text":"First time at a Jimmy Johns. Loved this place! The bread is delicious and the ingredients looked and tasted fresh! The staff was very friendly and helpful too! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Have been ordering from this location for a number of months now and have had no issues with order accuracy or excessive delivery times. All delivery people have been friendly and had a sandwich at my door by the 60 and the 101 in less than 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I have a way of ALWAYS getting my orders wrong, or the restaurant is out of what I want. It is litterally comical!! Not at Jimmy Johns. I eat at Jimmy Johns anywhere I can find one, and have had only 1 messed up order.   This location is new, and I didn't ever experience the \"NEW\" feel. Same great, guality, speedy service I have come to expect from Jimmy Johns!!"}
{"text":"If I could give them 0 stars, I really would. I am an avid hater of Jimmy John's customer service (god, why are their sandwiches so good though?). I've tried almost all Jimmy Johns locations around the area, and this is my third time going into this location for about 1-2 years. I asked the guy after receiving my sandwich, could I get more mayonnaise? This 16 year old child gave me two small packets of mayonnaise. I love mayo, so I asked for more. He then says, \"but that is more\" while pointing to my hand with small packets of mayonnaise on it. What? Why are you complaining when a customer wants a couple more packets of mayonnaise? Does mayonnaise cost more than 90 cents a pack? Is it because you are running out of mayonnaise? Is mayonnaise having a national shortage?  ARE YOU GUYS NOT A HUGE CORPORATION THAT MAKES THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER DAY AND YOU ARE BEING STINGY WITH MAYONNAISE?  After I told this guy, \"yes, but I want more\", he hesitantly gave me 3 more packets of mayonnaise.  God I hate Jimmy Johns. Everything about the customer service is terrible. Bunch of teenagers who don't know what they are doing with no respect for people who give them business."}
{"text":"No. No no no. NO NO. NO. NO. I love JJ's sandwiches. I'll give the god forsaken sandwiches 4 stars if I could. I've been to every JJ's in town, they are spread on the Phoenix map like the plague after all. The service at JJ's is the worst thing I have ever seen next to Mcdonalds. For a sandwich place that pays their employees better than minimum wage, this is the most disappointing service and I am NEVER let down by it. I go in to JJ expecting the worst kind of service, and I receive exactly that. This location is one of the worst. I've been here maybe 4-5 times, I love the sandwiches but I just absolutely dread going into this location if it wasn't for the convenience. Scratch that, I actually hate all JJ's. This is a long overdue rant.  On New years, after I got off work I decided to get a sandwich. The workers were too tired or something? To even notice me or get off the table to take my order. When they did, he looked annoyed, tired, and looked like he was hating his life. Look son, I just got off from an 8hour shift too. It's almost 11pm and I just want a good sandwich and good service, is that too much to ask? I ask the worker if he could leave the bread in, and he takes the bread that he had in his hand (with the bread out) and tosses it with the most hateful expression I could imagine and grabs a new one. Sorry I don't want some bread sitting out with the bread off of it. He throws the sandwich together and I sit in the dining area to eat, the workers look even MORE equally annoyed because it probably is in their company policy that they are not allowed to sit while a customer is eating in the restaurant. I ask for napkins, he looks at me like I have inconvenienced him. I ask for a cup of water, he looks like I just asked him to climb mt. Everest for him. THIS WASN'T SOME REGULAR EMPLOYEE. This looked like some kind of lead, the manager, or SOMEONE important. Screw this.  Two months later, I decided to go back because it's just simply a convenient place. Again, I love the sandwiches, it's just the service that sucks. I ask for the vito, and before I even finish saying it, the girl starts making it. I understand that you guys are FAST but let me finish saying \"extra---\" before you start grabbing the bread and slathering mayo all over it. Before I even finished the transaction, the girl gives me the sandwich. I didn't even have time to tell her add extra oil. not even extra cheese. I couldn't just open up the sandwich and tell her to pour oil all over it on the counter. What the hell.  A month later, I come back. Maybe it'll be a better experience this time, I think to my self. It's not.  I grab my waterbottle and I put it under the drink refill machine to get some ice and water. The worker immediately YELLS at me to STOP. I jump in surprise, and I look at him with confusion. This guy doesn't even tell me to stop refilling nicely, he just yells at me with the rudest language like I just stole his grandmother's money. He tells me that it's unsanitary and that I'm not allowed to refill my drink with my waterbottle here.  Look guy, I work as a cook. I understand sanitary regulations and this is the first place I have ever heard of this. I UNDERSTAND for waterbottles that are extra elongated with small mouth openings that t will make a mess and it probably is unsanitary, but my water bottle was A LARGE OPENING SMALL CAMELBACK waterbottle that fit the refill machine PERFECTLY, and was a tiny 16oz thing that took up maybe half the space as a large JJ's cup. If I were drinking out of the stupid machine with my mouth and salivating all over it, you could yell at me all you want. If I was using the machine to take a bird bath in the store, you can also yell at me, that's fine.  HOWEVER, even if what I'm doing is against the rules (there was no sign or anything), it gives you NO right to yell at a customer who paid over $20 for a sandwich. If he used polite language, then I would understand. If he approached me saying \"Ma'am, you can't use this with the waterbottle\" I would understand. Not, \"STOP, YOU CAN'T DO THAT\". Like I'm some 5 year old deaf child. Screw this. I have tons more stories from other JJ's as well. This review is catered to this store specifically, but other JJ''s services are not worth it. I wouldn't touch the store service with a 10ft pole. I don't know how they get away with making such wonderful sandwiches and having such TERRIBLE service."}
{"text":"Had a great experience there today.  We needed a big order in a hurry, and everyone there worked fast to get it done.  They were super friendly and even carried the food out to the car!"}
{"text":"Worst service and management! I work literally  2 minutes away and my sandwich came 20 minutes later after I called. I was on a 30 minute lunch break. Not only did they bring my sandwich late but thru FORGOT my drink. The least they could of done was offer a free sandwich but they don't care about their customers."}
{"text":"The food I ordered was ok but the customer service was horrible.  The young man taking my order was rude and had no personality. He didn't say hi or even greet me.  The lady making my sandwich said hi and was more friendly.   The food was not the best but what do you expect from a fast food sandwich shop!"}
{"text":"Don't bother! I've ordered from this Jimmy John's a few  times previously in hopes that the order errors, bad service and ridiculous wait times for delivery were a fluke,  but they're not. I don't think the management is paying attention.The staff themselves are mostly pleasant, but the subs I ordered continuously came out wrong. The only thing I don't want on my sub is tomatoes and have ordered them that way, but often I find that there are tomatoes, extra ingredients or missing ingredients on my sub. When calling in for delivery I've been given wait times of 10-20 minutes, only to wait for 45 minutes or an hour. The final straw was when I found additional charges on my receipt the last time I ordered that no one could explain and no offer to refund myster charges either. If you want what you order and expect it to be close to on time, eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Okay. So every time I call or stop by to this location. The employees are amazing! When I order they are patient and helpful. Alway on top of their shit."}
{"text":"Want a no frills sub sandwich with fresh ingredients with not much thought? This is the place. I would say it would be good to throw into your long rotation of lunch spots.  You get more than one would expect, an 8' for only $4.25. They are quick to make as there is not a lot of options per say in customizing your sandwich. TIP: Just remember this is not Subway so do all your customizing when purchasing.  The bread is different. More like a flatter version of french bread. Its not that is bad its just lacks any extra flavor it could add.  The ingredients I found to be of good quality and i think that's what made the most impression."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. I get a perfect portion of food when I am hungry. They hand me the sandwich by the time I can walk around the counter. The employees are always motivated and fun."}
{"text":"The staff at this location was rude and unfriendly!! Also the store itself was not the cleanest I have seen!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst sandwich i ever had, the employee failed to put right amount of ingredients in the sandwich. It was tasteless. I rather walk to walmart across the street and get a ready made sandwich from the refrigerator section or go to subway around the corner."}
{"text":"Just ordered two sandwiches and when I walked out to the car my wife opened hers and was extremely disappointed. I asked for wheat bread and he confirmed it was wheat bread 2 more times so my wife has white bread and not only is it white but rock hard on one side. I also asked for lettuce and vinegar on the tuna. There was no vinegar and all lettuce hardly any tuna. I call not even 10 minutes later and all they say is bring it back with the receipt. What happened to great customer service and the days when employees actually listened to the customer and gave them what they asked for. Not getting that here! We won't be back."}
{"text":"Went to Jimmy John's today-really lousy-it' not TOO BAD a sub, if only they would put some MEAT & CHEESE on it! Both the meat & cheese are sliced newspaper thin, so, all you taste is bread, lettuce, onion. No tomato taste, because the tomatoes suck and they slice them way too thin, of course. I used to own an independent sub shop and we went out of business after eleven years largely because we put WAY TOO MUCH meat and cheese on our subs! And we insisted on paying our employees at least $11 an hour (still not a living wage, always felt really bad about that). Plus, I walked in at 2:45 p.m. and there were SEVEN employees on duty! WTF? All making minimum wage I would bet. What a sad state of affairs-can't make a living selling top quality food at decent prices."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's but they really should have named this one an Express or something to indicate it is different from a \"regular\" restaurant as there is no indoor seating. Food was good, people were friendly, but this just wasn't a good location to take a lunch in the middle of our long road trip."}
{"text":"Who delivers but won't deliver within 2 miles because it is too far north. Terrible business!"}
{"text":"This place has great subs.  The #9 is a classic Italian sub with a really fresh taste.  Unlike another reviewer stated, the subs are made fresh to order.  The hot peppers which you can add are mighty tasty if you like that sort of thing...I only wish they put on more."}
{"text":"The sandwiches rock as usual - maybe with delivery you could offer A NAPKIN???  I asked my driver for one and he responded napkins are only available upon request and you have to request when you order. SERIOUSLY?  Charge $.01 for the sandwich and provide a napkin!!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer. JJ was always quick and easy but my latest experience came with a price. I ordered the #15 tuna on wheat and I was down to my last bite when I bit into what felt like glass. It chipped my top and bottom tooth.  I spoke with Tony, the manager in the middle of the day, the thing he offered me was another sandwich I told him that it doesn't fix my tooth. He sent a driver to come, pickup the sandwich so he could examine it.  I couldn't find the object myself but Tony never called me back to correct the mistake or even acknowledge any kind of correction needed. I called back and I spoke with Genene who said Tony was gone for the day and that she was the manager. She was never informed. I asked for the franchise corporate office number and she claimed that they don't have it and only knows her boss as \"Joe\".  The flakiness of the managers is troubling and the disregard for my damaged teeth is disturbing. This is not an honest location and they can count on never receiving my business again, not only because of their lack of care for what happened but for the lack of care of food preparation."}
{"text":"My first 5 star review: Solid subs And they'll do a delivery on a single sandwich And it doesn't take forever to get here.  This place fires on all cylinders. I have been in to eat, picked up and had it delivered (and from at least three locations in the area also) and they have yet to disappoint. And I am a picky, add-this-no-that kind of customer.  Wish they delivered even later than they do, but they blow pretty much every other sub place out of the water."}
{"text":"Fresh,fast, accurate and delivery drivers have all been amazing.  Because of that I order all the time!"}
{"text":"I will never ever order from Jimmy John's ever again I have given them for chances now every time I've had a delivery I place my order online left a tip online and they go back and they change the tip and that is not acceptable that is actually fraud. I have tried contacting a manager over the phone unfortunately the employees I think are acting as managers because they know that this is against the law I don't know if it's the delivery driver is doing it or if it's a staff member there at the store but every single time I have placed an order it has been over the amount that is signed for.  I have had to call my bank on several occasions and let them know this. the only reason I'm giving them one star is because the food is good but I will never order from them again I don't deal with fraudulent restaurants for employees because I have been in the service industry myself for over 25 years"}
{"text":"After ordering from Jimmy John's over the past few months I can say one thing: inconsistent. At the beginning I was blown away with their speed of delivery - about 10 minutes - and decent food, however as time went on their service dipped. Just recently I ordered a BLT, sweet tea no ice, and BBQ chips; the driver took an hour to deliver my meal because there was a large order to another customer and they filled my sweet tea with ice so I only received three flavorful sips. I was still happy with the meal but it does not take much to please a hungry man. I decided that it was a fluke. Today, I ordered a Pepe, sweet tea no ice, and BBQ chips. I was disappointed again with the slow service - 20 minutes - when they said it would be 10. Besides that they got everything right except they forgot the straw thereby forcing me to drink without one, which was no big deal. Overall, I really enjoy ordering from Jimmy John's because of the speed, decent food, and convenience, but when they do not meet those demands I have to look elsewhere for food."}
{"text":"This place is lightening fast and always friendly!! The sandwiches are always on point!! Thanks for serving our salon almost everyday!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here while traveling. the \"gourmet sandwiches\" in the name of the establishment is false advertising at best. I got a BLT. How do you eff up a BLT? cold microwave bacon and cold doughy bread. Even my dog wasn't interested and he eats cat turds. Another thing to note, and this could be unrelated but after eating here I had to sit in a car for hours near death from the most vile farts you can imagine...courtesy of my lover and Jimmy johns Italian sub. at least that's my speculation."}
{"text":"This place was good. First time going to JJ i told the guy at the register it was my first time. He suggested #12 and he was great! Location is really nice and clean. Im just not a big fan of their subs. But great business with great workers and location."}
{"text":"They're complete idiots. I've been there 3 times in the last two weeks and every time they made me the wrong sandwich. How hard is it to remember when you ask for roast beef to put roast beef on the sandwich? They all must have the attention span of a 5 year old with ADHD after eating 10 pixie sticks because apparently for these guys roast beef is turkey. I have trust issues now because even when I'm the only one in the place they still can't make a sandwich right. I'd give them zero stars if I could, but the chips are always good so I'll give them star."}
{"text":"I love their stuff! Great food, fast service and their delivery is very quick. I order online and save my account info for extra ease."}
{"text":"My favorite sub place around! Delicious, fast, and friendly. Always make it a point to try and end up here after running errands!"}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is solid. Much better quality than Subway. Great bread and super quick. They'll deliver just one sandwich if need be. This location is awesome and everyone there is super friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered the Country Club sub without mayo and with Italian vinaigrette instead. I am not a big mayo fan at all but really enjoy vinaigrette - always. After I sat down to enjoy, I asked if I could get a little more dressing for my sub - it was very dry. They said no....\"Jimmy does not let us give you any more vinaigrette.\" I said really, my problem is that I can not taste any on the sub. It tastes like lettuce and meat only. The \"Jimmy\" comment was from the guy that made the sandwich and the guy at the register. Obviously, there was no changing their mind and I had to go back and try to eat my sub. CRAZY....not good for customer service. I could not even finish the sub it was so dry. Not a good customer experience at this location on 3/25/2016."}
{"text":"Decent subs, but the ordering system is annoying and the staff is really clueless. This place needs a grown up in the worse way.  Some thoughts: quit hiding the napkins behind the counter. Label the subs for take out. Put subs in a bag. Take customers name upon order to avoid confusion. Open the line on the left side of the restaurant first instead of bottlenecking customers into the restroom hall. Finally, TURN DOWN THE MUSIC A NOTCH!"}
{"text":"Third strike! You're OUT! Don't allow someone to add items to the sandwich online if nobody cares enough to actually do it. Add onion and cut in half. I know... I know... why bother. Good thing I only had to wait 30-40 minutes (twice now in three days) for delivery.  Seems like the sandwich makers are freaky fast (not reading orders) and delivery.... well not so much."}
{"text":"Very polite but extremely SLOW!!!!!  The slogan is\"freaky fast\" but that is definitely not the case at this location."}
{"text":"One of the best sub joints around.  Lots better than Subway!!!!   It's always mobbed with customers, but the food comes out quick and fresh.  It's really yummy.  Love the bread!!!!!  Prices are good too.  My only complaint is that it is always like a ice box in there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat!  The crew that works there is great and you can't get a great sub like you can at Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"Every time I order here the staff is friendly and helpful. They are usually here between 7-10 minutes for delivery. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"Yup, when all fails, go to JJs ...I always order big joe #4"}
{"text":"Love this place. I come here a few times a week for lunch and I'm happy everytime. I don't see how there is bad reviews. I don't believe In writing a bad review just because you don't like the food. If you don't like it, don't come back, it just means this isn't the place for you. Everyone has different taste but everyone I talk to loves jimmy johns. There's no reason to give them a 1 star because your taste buds weren't on point. If there's one thing I have bad to say about this specific jimmy johns it is that their delivery radius is like a mile or less. But if you notice that most of there business comes from deliveries to all the businesses on Hampton Ave. They really don't have the time or need to deliver further so I don't blame them. Therefore, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I had some time between appts and got hungry so I stopped in but the place wasn't opened yet.  It was only 0930 but Katie unlocked the door and made a sandwich for me. She could easily have said they weren't opened yet.  There are several other options in the plaza even a grocery store.  She made my day with her kindness. My doctor had stood me up so she could finish her photo shoot! Yes, a photo shoot!  The sandwich hit the spot and was even better because Katie made me feel valued."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to echo ask the comments about the rude service. I used to like Jimmy Johns, but the customer service from the manager Thomas was horrible. He told me they do not deliver to our office because of the metal detectors, and that we have to go down and pick it up. This is untrue because as I explained I had ordered from them multiple times previously. He then said it takes too long for them to deliver to us when they have five other orders to get to. I ended up canceling my order, and granted they may not need my $10, but you would hope they would at least be honest and nice. No need to spend money here for over-priced mediocrity when there are tons of other sandwich places around."}
{"text":"Worst ice machine on the planet!  I wanted hot peppers on the side, not on my sandwich.  Was refused.  Corporate Policy. WTF!  Lost me as a customer.  No one dictates how I want my sandwich made."}
{"text":"This was a welcome site. After traveling all day we stopped at a taco place that made us practically hurl. We happened upon this store that had very friendly, professional, polite employees and the place was super clean. Thank you and raises for everyone!! Washington State Residents heading to Zion!"}
{"text":"I was just there today. Where do I start??  The staff (EVERYONE WORKING TODAY) was rude. They had no respect for the full building of customers.  The guy on the register was new and I was totally fine with him taking his time so he didn't screw up my order, the kids on the line however, were so mean to him, telling him he needed to hurry and get off the register because it was taking too long.  Umm hello I can hear you there wasn't a line behind me, so cool your jets, and learn some manners! Wouldn't it be smart to ask him of he needed any help? How is he going to learn if you treat him like crap, yell and make fun of him?? Also maybe you should wait for the building to clear out before you bark orders at the new guy to get you this and that while you stand there doing nothing but laugh at him and say (very loudly) you don't want to be here and you don't want to do this or that. I'm sorry but there are plenty of people in need of a job right now that are more then happy to make sandwiches. Also maybe you shouldn't roll your eyes and get attitudes with PAYING customers.  The kid with the justin beiber hair cut who constantly flips his hair (which by the way is gross,  especially since your not wearing a hair net and your basically flipping your nasty hair in peoples food) I'm talking to you! Your rude and need to be fired. I would NEVER talk to a customer the way you talked to a lady today. I heard everything and saw you make fun of her as she walked away. SHAME ON YOU! I will never return to this location"}
{"text":"Horrible delivery service. Accidentally called the wrong store and was not within their delivery area but no one told me that when I placed the order. An hour later still had not received the order. When I called back to find out where it was they told me I was out of the area. I asked why no one had called and they said they had tried to call. I did not receive any calls or show any missed calls. When I said that, they said that maybe they called the wrong number. Likely story.   So then I asked which store I should order from. They couldn't tell me and asked if I have the app on my phone and I could find it there.  I realize apps are convenient at times, but they should not replace customer service. Hopefully my credit card will not be charged since I never received my order.   I am unlikely to patronize Jimmy johns again even though I have ordered from them many times in the past and I have previously had a good experience.  If you do place an order, make sure that you ask whether you're in their delivery area.  Don't assume that they will tell you if you're not."}
{"text":"I love love Jimmy Johns.  Super good whole grain AND French bread.    I'm a Pepe #1, awesome ham and provolone cheese with just lettuce, tomato and mayo, it's divine.  I'm also a big fan the Beach Club, turkey, avocado spread, sprouts, etc.  Yum!   The guys/gals at Avondale totally rock. I'm a freezebox all the time so my only advice is to turn up the temp a few degrees (I just bring a sweatshirt).  Can't say enough good things - love this place!!"}
{"text":"I worked at jimmy John's for over a year, your bread is always overdone, Everything always tastes old and you literally can never get my order right. I actually can't believe that you can give me this crap and think that I'm going to be ok with it"}
{"text":"Good food. Quick service. Always fresh! The workers have been nice when I have gone in. Don't love the location. Hard to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"I love the totally tuna..its the bomb. .I get it with all the freebies.  So good..that's the only sandwich ive ever ordered from there...every time! !!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 sandwiches for the 1st time today from this location. Being a former employee of this company I expected my order to be their fun saying of \"freaky fast\" however it's now been 40 minutes and there has been no knock at my door.  After about 20 minutes of waiting I called to ask when my food was arriving because I understand lunch rushes can be tricky. However, the man I spoke to told me that my order had already left the building 10 minutes ago alongside another order so I figured \"okay it won't be too much longer.\" Another 20 minutes goes by and now I'm upset because I've waited 40 long minutes for a company who prides themselves on being \"so fast you'll freak\" well needless to say this location EVEN IF YOU LIVE 2 MINUTE AWAY-just across the street will be FREAKY SLOW. Utterly disappointed in this location."}
{"text":"Very bad experience here. Service was beyond bad and the sub was at best just average."}
{"text":"Monday, October 21st, 2013  Here's an update on my disaster from Saturday!  Jimmy John's representative contacted me earlier today!  I honestly didn't expect that!  A gentleman named Cory Clemans from Jimmy John's corporate office called, and had me go through my tale of woe again.  He was very pleasant and very nice!  He told me that he would contact the owner of the location, and have him contact me about the incident and about the credit for the missing items in our order.    The bad news is that I was told that since this is a franchise and not a corporate store, that he has no leverage.  So far, I have not yet heard from the owner of this franchise either, but I will keep everyone posted as to what happened...  My original post is as follows:     Saturday, October 19th, 2013  I can honestly state that this is the worst food experience in my entire life.  Every time I felt that things could not get worse today, it did!  At 11:20 am today, I went to the Jimmy Johns website, http://jimmyjohns.c..., and attempted to place an internet order for eight people, using their website.  I kept being prompted to call the store, as internet orders were not being accepted at this time for that location.  Nice!    I called the store at 11:30 am, and mentioned that their website wasn't working.  I was told that their internet connection has been down for days, and they therefore could not accept internet orders at this time.  Nice touch for a company with an internet ordering website!  I placed an order for 8 sandwiches, 4 bags of chips and 2 pickles.  I could barely hear them on the telephone, as they had the music cranked up really loud at their end.  Again, nice ghetto touch!  I was told that we could expect our food around Noon.  So far, not a good start!  At Noon, they called me to state that they were having trouble processing the card..  We repeated the numbers and figured out the problem.  At 12:30, I called and spoke to the manager, Pat, who stated that they only had one delivery driver today, and he refused to even estimate as to when the food would arrive.  I told him that I was very disappointed as to how long the order was taking.  So much for Freaky Fast delivery that they are advertising!  He also refused to provide an estimate as to how much longer that it would take to get our lunch.  I suggested that I was going to contact corporate headquarters in Champaign IL, and he told me to go ahead and report them, that he didn't care.  Nice attitude!    At 1:00 pm, the delivery guy shows up, reeking of Marijuana.  Nice ghetto touch again!  The guy who suggested that this location was run by a bunch of Stoners was not kidding!  I asked him to tell Pat, the Manager, as to how disappointed we were with the 1 1/2 hour Freaky Fast service, and in front of my coworkers and clients, he stated that it was my fault because of the problem with my credit card (which took all of 5 minutes to correct).  Nice ghetto touch, and no tip for you!    It doesn't end there.  We were shorted 2 bags of chips and received a drink that was not ordered.  I called Pat, the Manager, and asked him to run a credit and fax the slip to me.  He stated that he would do it, but refused to send me any documentation.  Again, nice touch.    To sum it up, they would not admit that there was anything wrong with the handling of this order, and that 1 1/2 hour delivery service was acceptable.  I have already sent an e-mail to corporate, but I will be very surprised if I hear back from them on Monday, as I requested.  I cannot imagine why I would EVER put myself through this again.  DO NOT EVER CONSIDER ORDERING ANYTHING FROM JIMMY JOHNS AND THEIR CREW OF CLOWNS!  It isn't worth the agony!"}
{"text":"Bread was hard as hell and they don't make food as you order it. You have go back and have them fix it. Plus, my food was thrown in my hand. It was fast as advertised but rude and definitely not accurate."}
{"text":"Great service. Six minutes from order to delivery at my hotel room. Food was delicious. Wish there was one where I live."}
{"text":"This location of Jimmy John's is a regular lunch stop when I am working in the Northwest. Clean shop, friendly staff, quick service.  I love turkey, I don't like ham or super salty meats (read: Italian meats) on my sandwiches (except bacon of course!). Jimmy John's has a nice selection of sandwiches with turkey on them. Here are my faves:  Turkey Tom - simple...turkey, cheese, regular fixins Beach Club - turkey, cheese, avo, cukes, sprouts...a California Girl's sandwich dream Club Lulu - turkey, bacon, regular fixins Bootlegger - turkey, roast beef, regular fixins  Fresh ingredients, good portion of meat (for me), lots of veggies, extra peppers please! Quality sandwich place."}
{"text":"Good service, vegetables were fresh roast bed and ham was not. It was also Monday maybe left over from the weekend usually I take stuff back but I'm just really tired of arguing with companies lately over their **** service. These are franchises so I'll stick with the mooresville location"}
{"text":"When you order delivery ask the driver how much he makes an hour. The answer will be $7.25 an hr . Federal min wage. Ask them how much JJ compensates them for gas or wear and tear  on their vehicle.  Can you believe that this company is so heartless and greedy the answer is zero. No gas and no percentage of the order so effectively they make less than min wage. Their tips are low bc for some reason a bunch of people don't tip JJ delivery driver's.  Like the driver is indebted to them to bring them a sandwich and then they stiff them. It's mostly the pos mall employees in the university area. To all of them that man just spent $1.50 out of his own pocket to bring you that sandwich.  You and anyone else who doesn't tip delivery drivers should be ashamed of themselves as a human being. Who are you to treat people like that ? Shame on you."}
{"text":"Just tried to order some food and was told that I'm apparently in one of their \"dead zones\" for deliveries.....I'm 2.4 miles away from this location and you mean to tell me that you can't deliver food to me and take money from me?! As a business, you should be welcoming anyone that offers your establishment money!!!! I've ordered food from restaurants that are 5-6 miles from where I live, and they had no problem taking my money! What poor business decisions by these employees!"}
{"text":"Great customer service at this location. The delivery isn't as fast as other locations, however they always call me to let me know why. I just received a very professional and courteous phone call from TJ (I belive that was her name) to let me know when I placed my online order, that their driver was already out on 3 deliveries and that I'm next in line as soon as he got back. I very much appreciated the update."}
{"text":"Visited the newest Jimmy John's in our area on Sunday afternoon. The place still has that \"new store feel\" it's so squeaky clean, but what made it really seem like a brand new Jimmy John's was the lack of experience from the people behind the counter.  My husband ordered a #9 and asked for hot peppers as well. This completely flummoxed the young woman working the register, but after a couple of confused looks one of the guys making a sandwich said something to her and she put the order in.  Next up, I ordered a #2, also with hot peppers. She repeated my order back to me, even as she got it wrong on the register.  My husband received his sandwich with maybe 3 hot peppers on it. My sandwich had none, and the receipt showed she didn't include it when she rang us up.  Everything about the people working there just screams \"NEW!!!!\" right now. I had to ask her to give me a cup for the drink I ordered after she just turned away from us to help the next customer. The wait for our sandwiches wasn't long but it was comical watching the guy behind the counter reposition each of our sandwiches several times, moving it by millimeters precisely before wrapping it.  This was the worst experience we've had at Jimmy John's. I've never had them get my order wrong before. It wasn't a TERRIBLE experience in the grand scheme of things, but it's definitely below the standards I've seen in their Pineville store. I'll give this new location another chance, but not for another month or two so the staff gets a chance to learn how to ring up orders correctly."}
{"text":"Your basic sub shop.  Great delivery speeds."}
{"text":"I rarely buy sandwiches at restaurants, especially if I know I can make it good (if not better) at home. With that being said I do love eating a Club Lulu from Jimmy John's every now and then.   Their bread is what really gets me. The texture and freshness is great and would definitely be impossible to recreate at home. I also love anything with avocado spread on it. At this location in particular the staff are always really friendly which I greatly appreciate. In some other locations (like the one closest to my home) are not as spot on with their customer service. Oh well, whatcha gonna do.   Extra tip: If you are also too lazy to not only make your own sandwich but actually leave the house to get it you can make your order for delivery. They are pretty quick too!  So, if you love fresh, delicious sandwiches with lots of options to choose from then give Jimmy John's a try."}
{"text":"Not freaky fast! Don't go there when they get big orders. They won't work your sandwich in between making a big order. Also they won't tell you upfront that you have to wait. After standing there for at least 5 min, I asked if it would be a long wait. She said, oh yeah, BIG order.\" I let her know we were in a hurry, my husband had to get to work and she just kept repeating that it was a big order and had attitude when we complained to the manager about why we wanted a refund and that they should work other customers in when you have big orders or at least communicate that it will be a long wait time. We ended up getting a refund and leaving."}
{"text":"Quick but horrible quality. Have tried on multiple occasions but this remains the worst sandwich shop chain I have ever been to"}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns, some of the best sandwiches around. However, this location legitimately will not deliver to my house 1.4 miles away. Who ever heard of a one-mile delivery radius?  The sandwiches are so good I'd walk there if I didn't have a busted foot. Argghhhh"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery. Have ordered from this location(before they moved) several times before, with no issues. However, when sandwiches arrived the bread was hard, even my 7 and 5yr old thought it was \"hard as a rock!\" My husband called and spoke with the manager, just to let him know the bread was terrible. The manager told him that, \"It was not possible the bread was only 4 hours old.\" He was very rude. I myself work in the casino industry, and believe in service recovery, none of that here! Definitely do not plan on visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Won't deliver over a mile radius. I'm on the same street, 4 mins away by car and out of their delivery area. Pretty sad."}
{"text":"Order from here all the time, always great service and fresh good sandwiches. Super fast delivery, always within 15 min."}
{"text":"I live 2 Miles away... IF THAT... And \"they don't deliver that far up.\"  Really??? You are 2 miles away. Not happy. I will order Chinese food, which delivers from 7 miles away... Thanks."}
{"text":"first thing you notice when you order is the attitude of the employee. this was my second visit and last. the cashier who also takes your order, on both occasions had an attitude. we both ordered but on opening the sandwich realised it was completely dry, no mayo, no butter or mustard, yuuuuck!!!!! asked the cashier for mayo and was told we should have ordered it with mayo, was given 2 little packs that would probably have covered a potato chip. had to ask for salt and pepper, napkins and sweetener for the ice tea, nothing is put out but they have tables to eat at so wheres the sense?  this is strictly a delivery joint. 2nd visit was no better, employees need to learn how to smile and get rid of the attitude!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I had Jimmy John's so I thought I'd try out the new location. I recall liking the multi-grain bread better than the subs so I was careful to order the beach club. Only when I got my order it was on the sub. Yeah, I'm still not a fan. The staff seemed bothered by my presence and there wasn't a single napkin visible in the restaurant. None were provided with the sandwich so I had to ask. They were kept behind the counter. Weird."}
{"text":"Honestly not a bad spot, but its not great either.  I feel that this location is on par with other locations, probably a training ground if anything which would explain a few mistakes in my order but nothing to cry about.  Music is a little loud for me but the most important thing is the food which is just fine."}
{"text":"What the heck!? Super fast service. I barely checked-in on Yelp! and they already had my Turkey Tom ready :) I love these guys!"}
{"text":"Fast. Easy.  Staff is so so. The JJ's in Wisconsin are awesome!!! No other state can come near to their pep!  The cashier was leaning on the counter and would just say \"yeah. Ok. What else?\"  Subs were made fast.  Store needed some love from all the crumbs piled everywhere and over flowing trash."}
{"text":"Average subs. Very fast good for delivery downtown. Not worth going out of your way but if you are in the mood for a sub and in the area it will do."}
{"text":"Your commercials shouldn't be better than your food.  Jimmy John's is new to Surprise so it was exciting to try something new and we've all seen/heard their commercials!  They were loud, but maybe part of their deal and there were several employees which seemed odd since there were only 2 people in the dining room and not even one of their 4 delivery phones were ringing.  Anywho...the sandwich was just ok, it wasn't bad and it wasn't good.  There were only 3 bread choices 1 of which was a wrap and the french bread seemed less than fresh.  I do love that they use Best Foods mayo, that's a plus.  I like Mr. Goodcents much better."}
{"text":"Fast service, great food, excellent service. Best all around chain sub shop, by far."}
{"text":"Fast and Delicious. I love the J.J. Gargantuan and have them add hot peppers. Have eaten at this and other locations and have never had a bad experience or bad food. I've picked up catering for office lunch and it was a hit."}
{"text":"Not a bad little sandwich shop, but not a great one either. After flying into Cleveland for work, and spending the entire day at the office, Jimmy John's was the only quickie eatery I could find in the area near my hotel (Hyatt @ the Arcade). I jumped in right before they closed, and was able to grab a ham and provolone sandwich w/out all the fixins. I have to admit it was pretty tasty, but nothing spectacular - Subway has a much larger variety of sub offerings, and quite frankly the service was lacking at JJ's. (My sandwich was made and placed on the counter w/out so much as a word. I know it was closing time, but a \"here ya go\" would've gone a long way.)  I'm giving Jimmy John's a three-fer simply b/c the food was decent and it hit the spot at the right time. As far as this being a place I'll be crazy-fond of if I ever visit the city again, it's not looking too good. But hey, I'm a tourist - the regulars might have a different opinion.  YMMV as well..."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Jimmy John's lives up to its logo so fast you'll freak."}
{"text":"Go someplace else!  The kids working here aren't smart enough to follow an online order.  Something as simple as \"mayo packets\" added to an order made via their app and they didn't include them!  Try appeasing a 8 year old trying to eat a dry sandwich.  We went out of our way to go to JJ.  Next time, we will go to Subway or Frye's deli."}
{"text":"I placed an order for a Beach Club #12, which is essentially a turkey sandwich with avocado spread, lettuce and cucumbers.  I did not want any tomatoes or mayo.  They made sure not to screw up such a simple request by not only removing the tomatoes and mayo BUT ALSO the avocado and (drum roll please...) the TURKEY MEAT!!!  Imagine my surprise when I take a bite and it is a lettuce sandwich.  I already had these guys on probation for screwing up a previous order but no more reprieves.  There are tons of better places (Jersey Mike's, Fire House Subs, even Blimpies, etc.) but I ordered from these guys because they do deliver just one sandwich and when you don't want to fight the crowds, they get you out of a jam.  Not anymore.  Next time, to make sure I am getting what I ordered, I will drive."}
{"text":"Really inconvenient they don't have high chairs. Not coming to this location again. Had my 16 month old with us and wanted to enjoy a meal, instead had to supervise her from standing on the chairs and trying to climb."}
{"text":"I am from nevada so when it was raining of course I didn't want to leave my room. So, I ordered Jimmy Johns. They are supposed to be really fast so I started a timer when I hung up from placing my order. I am about a mile from the store and from the moment I hung up the phone until the moment the driver was at my door was 20 minutes. A little slow but the sandwich was amazing. I ordered a complicated sandwich and am very happy that it is all correct. Bread tasted great and everything was fresh."}
{"text":"Normally I would give a five, but I was just at this location, about 20 minutes before closing. I was the only one there and ordered a Turkey Tom WITH onions and peppers to go. I just got home and there are no onions or peppers. Like, you were not making any other orders. Very disappointed, for the first time."}
{"text":"There's always smiling faces and quick service when I order my veggie on 7 grain bread. It's fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Pepe....add sprouts, salt, pepper, O & V, cucumber, onion then pickle on the side= yum"}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars, I would. I often order from this location for delivery, but the last two times I have eaten sandwiches from this establishment the experiences have been more than terrible. 1) I ordered two sandwiches for delivery and they were SMOTHERED in so much oil and mayonnaise that my room-mate and I could not choke down our sandwiches. ***2) The last time I went in to grab a sandwich for myself, the staff had a sandwich sitting on the counter that somebody did not pick up. One staff member said she wished she knew a homeless person she could give it to. I spoke up and said that I knew of one I'd be willing to take it to right then and there. She said she would have to okay it with her boss first. She stepped around the corner to ask her boss, close enough that I could hear the entire conversation, and he responded with, \"A homeless person? I HATE HOMELESS PEOPLE! NO!\" She immediately came back and apologized, saying that they were not able to give the sandwich away. Another staff member looked past the first and said, \"I'll take the sandwich! Can I have it?\" I couldn't hear their bosses response, but then she asked what they were going to do with it then. He said clearly, \"Throw it away!\" She then quickly handed me the sandwich and snapped back at him, \"That's messed up!\" I am very proud of her for boldly handing me the sandwich and standing her ground with her boss, but VERY UPSET THAT HER BOSS IS SUCH A JERK, and that he couldn't even be professional about his position. I truly enjoy a good sandwich from Jimmy John's, but I will not be visiting this location anytime soon! This man clearly needs a wake-up call. Let him spend a month on the streets and see how he feels then. It could happen to anyone, including HIM! The man I gave the sandwich to was extremely appreciative and happened to be a United States Veteran! Jimmy John's, you really should be ashamed of this manager that is representing not only himself, but your company as well. Our homeless community consists of PEOPLE, many of which are veterans that have sacrificed too much to list here...in order to serve this country...which your company should be proud to be a part of...they deserve just as much respect as anyone else!!!!! I'm not saying that your company should give every leftover sandwich to the homeless; for I know that could cause people to start lingering and loitering around your store in hopes of getting a sandwich, but for Christ's sake, BE PROFESSIONAL ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!! If a customer is willing to give away a sandwich, maybe ask that they don't tell the homeless person that it was a leftover.  *****YOUR ATTITUDE MATTERS TO THIS CUSTOMER!!!*****"}
{"text":"Just like the commercial. I put down the phone and before the table is set the doorbell rings. Consistently good quality, reasonably priced and a great selection. Perfect for those occasionally necessary quick, consistently good meals."}
{"text":"So little for so much.  My daughter and I kept asking ourselves what we had just spend so much money on??  Our roast beef sandwich had almost no meat, and with only one cheese option (which was extra) and few choices in toppings there was not a lot to eat except bread and lettuce.   And where the heck are the napkins?  They have all these signs saying how great they are, but the food falls way short of the price and the hype.   I would much rather get a sandwich at sprouts!!"}
{"text":"I only get Jimmy John's for delivery at 1am. Seriously, why would you go to such a typical, limited, average place any other time? If you have a choice, try subway. But if you want a place that delivers after everyone else closes, this place is perfect. I eat here twice a week only because I sleep odd hours and my normal lunch is at 2am."}
{"text":"Poor customer service...  I ordered a sandwich to go and when I opened it, I discovered that they had left out almost all of the meat. I called and they offered to put a credit for a free sandwich in their system, under my phone number. Great!   Except when I went to get my sandwich(about a week and a half later), I was informed that I had to use the credit within 7 days. This was not explained to me on the phone, nor did they even mentioned that the credit has an expiration date. They declined to honor the credit.  They basically said, \"oh well, tough luck.\"  I'd be happy to revise the low rating if they would honor the credit they offered to make amends for their mistake. Otherwise, I'll be going to Capriotti's..."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quick service. The new store employees make an effort to engage each customer. Same jimmy johns food, but in a fresh new spot. Clean, good food, reasonable prices, go in late and get a good deal on day old bread."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars I would  . First Time here I ordered no mayo on my sandwich and they gave me extra mayo . Yeah ordered today and they charged me then decided to tell me one full hour later that they were out of range for delivery . Not to mention rudely hung up on my friend when she called to place an order for pickup after ... I've been a waitress. Bartender etc . For 8 yrs. train ur employees to have common courtesy please"}
{"text":"Rude service.  Sandwich made but was not announced.  Saw heavy set woman employee pick up a sandwich sitting on  the counter and sneer at me as if to say who hasn't come up here to pick up their sandwich.  Walked up.  Had to check ticket myself to see if it was mine.  It was.  Asked for a bag to which she responded \"they're right there\".  Since they were behind the counter I didn't grab one.  Another employee came over to the rescue but I was insulted at that point and walked out.  Not friendly.  Not helpful.  Issue is with customer service at this location 1515 N Gilbert not with product.  Sandwich was ok.  I've frequented Scottsdale location many times and never been treated like this."}
{"text":"I love jimmy johns. In college this was my go to food for hangovers and quick meals. Now I live in San Diego and we have no jimmy johns! So when I come to visit my mom in vegas this is the shop closest to her.  The food is good as always but this location is a little different. The employees have been rude during my past few visits. Also we used to order delivery from this location that is a 5 min drive from the house. This last week when I visiting they announced they no longer deliver to us! My mom was upset because getting around isn't easy for her and the delivery makes it so simple to get a tasty sandwich.   Good food but he shop itself could improve. Still it's super fast and tastes great!"}
{"text":"Nope. It's just a place to make a basic sandwich. I can't pick my bread, it's not warmed up, it just bread and condiments."}
{"text":"Kinda a disappointment for me. I had the #10- Hunter's Club (1/4 lb of sliced medium-rare roast beef) which falls under the \"club style\" sandwich.  According the menu, the club style are double meat.  It looked like a regular ol' sub- and NOT double meat.  Like another reviewer, I thought it would an alternative to Subway or Quizno's, but it was just the same.  The bread was similar, the shredded lettuce, and meat.  It was decent, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Ive been in here maybe 4 times and each time the customer service was awful. The staff is young, annoying and unprofessional. Totally irritated. Sandwich is aiiight!"}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR BAG BEFORE LEAVING! I went there today and ordered two sandwiches one turkey and one veggie. two different prices and when i got home i had two turkey sandwiches!  The also directed me to the pick up line for my receipt and they never gave it to me so when I called to complain about the order they want to tell me i have to have the receipt!!! THats the complaint hellooooooooo!"}
{"text":"Consistent deliciousness! I'm a sammich lover.....and i prefer Jimmy Johns over Subway, hands down. Bread is fresh, soft, buttery, accommodating to such goodies like deli oven roasted turkey, fine shred lettuce, provolone cheese, cucumbers sliced paper thin/skin on, small red ripe tomatoes and lathered in real mayo........ask them to include the \"middle bread\" for extra yummo. Engaging staff. Fun atmosphere. Family/pup friendly. Small space with big love. Smells heavenly. You will want to get a sammich for later!!! Trust me yelpers!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this location doesn't have better ratings. Have always had fantastic service both at the location and delivery. Their delivery really is crazy fast, I don't know how they do it!"}
{"text":"The food is Jimmy John's, so if you like Jimmy John's, you'll like this.  This review is really for the delivery.  I order delivery from here all the time, and they've never messed up my order.  It's always been fast with friendly service, even in bad weather.  Online ordering is easy...  No complaints."}
{"text":"In love with the veggie sandwich on 9 grain wheat. The layer of provolone, lettuce tomatoes, (extra onions), cucumbers and avocado spread deliciously hits the spot time and time again. If there's less then 3 people ahead of me, I'm usually in and out within 5 mins max."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying JImmy Johns  for years, my fave was always The Beach, then I tried the Tuna unwich and now I'm enjoying the Vito. They really make great sandwiches and fast."}
{"text":"Always go for the gargantuan...the staff is very rude...get in your way...hey man just trying to get my drink ..chips ...and get out...live in the unlv area...think ill cross maryland pkwy and go to FIREHOUSE...the bike delivery guys act like jerks in traffic...cut you off..have attitudes...hey bud...are your customer...fashion fixie dorks...love to see em ride singletrack..anyway ok sandwiches...thuggy..employees...LAME..."}
{"text":"gourmet my arse!  Unless they have changed the definition of Gourmet to mean crap. I ordered a Roast Beef sub and was expecting/hoping for a good sammie.  My colleague returned with the sandwiches, I opened mine up and...a 6 inch white sub, lank lettuce, 3 slices of tomato and about 3 slices of roast beef (not the good stuff).  Another road lunch turned to poopy, but at least no food poisoning yet! Boulder readers will know what I mean.  Onto the next meal"}
{"text":"I'll tell ya one thing: the food definitely came out fast. Like, extremely fast. Usually the sandwiches are decent, but the one I had did not taste like it had fresh veggies.  I'll be sure to come again to try this place out again. I will give it another chance because usually I have a good experience at Jimmy John's and their super fast service!"}
{"text":"Very lazy here. I got the tuna plenty of times and each time it gets more and soggy. It was dripping this time. So disgusting. They can't even do their job right but every other sandwich  shop can"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love Jimmy Johns. But this location has a serious delivery radius issue. I live 3 miles from the place and that's too far to deliver. They would probably get a lot more business if they delivered more than a few blocks."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's and am extremely happy to have one closer to my house!"}
{"text":"I have a new favorite sandwich place in Summerlin. Although I live JUST outside the prescribed delivery area for JJ's (2 tenths of a mile), the gentleman who answered the phone agreed to deliver to my home. This was our first time ever ordering from JJ's and I have to say WE LOVED IT! Great sandwiches (I had the Gargantuan) and speedy service. The vegetables were fresh, the meat was super moist and tasty. I am thoroughly impressed with these guys. I would have given five stars, but not until I can order online. Corporate needs to adjust the delivery area for this location - especially since a third of this locations 1 mile delivery area is in Red Rock Canyon where nobody lives. Come on! Give 'em an extra quarter mile."}
{"text":"This Jimmy Johns is exceptional because it offers one of the new Coke Freestyle soda fountains. This divine instrument dispenses over 100 Coca-Cola products! Unlike standard fountains, it offers Diet versions of Fanta, Barq's root beer, Powerade, and Sprite. To top it all off, Sprite comes in flavors such as grape, raspberry, cherry, and peach. Could a soft drink dispenser get any better? I submit that it could not!"}
{"text":"1) Staff cannot remember customer orders after being told numerous times.  2) Music is way too freakin' loud, can't understand staff or have conversations with others. ALWAYS have to ask the staff to speak up over the music - SAY IT WITH YOUR CHEST!  3) Freaky fast? I think not - for customer pickup at least.  After a 10 min drive, my sandwich should be done...yet I arrive to them goofing around in the back, oblivious to the fact that I'm standing there watching them play patty cake - there are absolutely NO customers in the joint (wonder why?).  To the General Manager - if you read this, please straighten up your store for the sake of customer experience and future business!  FAQ:  - I actually do Love Jimmy Johns, just not this location - No I'm not 80 yrs old"}
{"text":"SOOOO Glad they came to Rantoul and wish them continued success as they have had all over the place!!"}
{"text":"As far as JJ's goes, this one is good. Food is always good and the service is great. They are definitely very fast with their deliveries, which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Still awesome.  I order delivery quite frequently. YUM"}
{"text":"Placed order on line at 12:59pm and was delivered 40 minutes later AAANNNDDD the sandwich wasn't made to how I ordered it. Not happy"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is the best.  The bread is always super fresh and chewy. The have super fast service and delivery. And I mean SUPER fast.  My sandwich was ready before I was done ordering.  Definitely go there."}
{"text":"I got the Beach Club sandwich (~$7) which was a good portion and decently priced. There was no wait and I got my sandwich immediately. And the sandwich was delicious. I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Freaky fast delivery and order was spot on!"}
{"text":"Only been here once and I tried the #9 (their italian hero) and I was pleasantly surprised.  Very good balance of bread consistency, cheese and dressing creating a delicious compliment to the meats.  The prices are very reasonable here and I look forward to trying out their other items.  They have delivery too.  *serves coke products"}
{"text":"Took the last bite of my sandwich today and nearly choked from swallowing this nasty long hair. I know you make sandwiches fast, but please hold the hair!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at the Jimmy John's by The Lakes Durango and it is always great. I was in Red Rock area and dropped by this one for first time.   I got three sandwiches. One was made wrong. The bread was so stale/hard on two of them that we had to throw them away. One was so bad it hurt teeth to try and bite. It should have been obvious to the people making these sandwiches that the bread should have been thrown away.   I am too far away to return for a refund so I went to the Jimmy John's website and when I submitted the complaint it goes to a 404 error. I rarely give one-star reviews w/o allowing a restaurant a chance to fix things. I gave them their chance.   They also did not give me a receipt. If someone that owns the place wants to make it right, here is the order to look up: Slim 4 + cheese, Slim 5 and a #5 with peppers (they forgot to put on). The total was $15.68 paid in cash and I was there about 6:30pm tonight."}
{"text":"As much as I do love their sandwiches, I won't go back to this location for quite some time. When I placed my order, I should have gotten the employee's name then talked to the manager, but I just wanted to leave.  I asked if I could get Italian dressing on the side and his comment was, \"You can only get the dressing on the sandwich or dry! We don't serve anything on the side.\" He was very rude.  Good luck to any of you who go here.  It wasn't busy when I went in either at 2pm."}
{"text":"The service at this Jimmy Johns was amazing.  The employees all seemed happy and enjoyed their jobs.  It took less than a minute to get our food.  MUCH better place than the taco bell near by.  Look the freaky fast service and great food!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery. I like the hunter  (#10 roast beef). Didn't care for the tuna."}
{"text":"Love this place. Gets a little crowded at times, but you can't be the price of the slim sandwich. Great bread."}
{"text":"No mayo!  No mayo!!!  Seriously how hard is that??  The order taker repeated my order back to me correctly, the person handing me my sandwich said \"#9, no mayo\", the ticket said no mayo, and my sandwich had about half a jar of mayo on it. I got it to go and had to rush back to work, so I could get it fixed.   This may sound trivial to some, but I'm sure there are many like me for whom mayo makes a sandwich inedible.   And really, it's sort of the minimal standard for a sandwich place."}
{"text":"When I ordered online I forgot to add lettuce to my order. So I called and they tell me they can't add lettuce to my order because it doesn't cost money? Are you kidding me?!  I'm half a mile from the store and it's now 49 min since I placed my order and still no delivery! Called back to get my money back! This place Is a joke! You really need to step it up!"}
{"text":"What business in MODERN DAY SOCIETY does not have utensils. So if some of the meat in my sandwich falls out then I have to use my fingers. I AM NOT AN ANIMAL I AM A HUMAN BEING. If the sandwiches were not as good as they are I would eat here. And apparently there's only 1 cashier and 1 sandwich maker and 3 people to look cool. Wake up before you have to close due to the lack of customers."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the \"rules\" get in the way of providing great customer service. We have eaten here a few times and every time there's something I am disappointed in. The concept is you get your own napkins and bag your own sandwich to go, but that doesn't work. When your food is ready they call your sandwich out and walk away, like they have better things to do, like chit-chat, or stand around with other employees, instead of actually being attentive to customers.  Every time I ask for napkins or for a bag, I  get a finger point as a response. It's not that difficult to place a couple napkins on top of the sandwich so they are present when you go to grab your food, and then ask if you want a bag to go. This last time when we walked in the first thing the guy at the counter said wasn't \"Hi\" or \"Welcome to Jimmy Johns\", it was \"we're out of bread\". He really meant the bread was finishing baking. We went ahead and ordered anyway and had to wait a few minutes for our sandwiches.  If you walk in expecting a quick sandwich with no service, this place does the job."}
{"text":"We et hear 3-5 times a month. Always fresh. Always good  and ridiculously fast!  Anything from drive thru to delivery!"}
{"text":"Walked in to order a beach club sandwich. The lady was really awkward but took my order. I grabbed chips and some cookies, got rang up and sat down to wait. There were about four staff members just sitting around at the tables, not doing anything. I wasn't given a bag to put all my items in so I had to carry it all out individually, which was difficult for me to get in the car with and got home to discover that my sandwich had no bean sprouts in it and no one bothered to tell me if they didn't have any or what. Very unprofessional and disappointing as the other locations I've visited were very friendly, asked questions if need be, and would at least give me a bag for my things.  I called and told them of my experience after discovering my sandwich wasn't what I usually see from other locations. They said they didn't know if I wanted bean sprouts but didn't bother asking me and that they didn't know why I wasn't given a bag. There was nothing said about correcting anything and so I told them I wouldn't be coming back and the staff really needs better training. I understand this is just a fast food place, but have a little pride in your work and some common sense in customer service! If you're supposed to take an order for food, why couldn't anyone ask to make sure I was getting what I paid for?"}
{"text":"Whatever you do don't forget to have something put on your sub when they are making it. They DO NOT give you a side of something after the sub has been made. Horrible policy set by Jimmy Johns. Employee did offer for me to bring my sub back in and they would put my item on the sub. I didn't have time for that. Extremely dis-satisfied with the outcome! No peppers on my sub. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I get lunch from here every now and then.  Sometimes I stop in... sometimes I order for delivery.  Pretty standard Jimmy John's.  Quick delivery.  Good sandwiches.  They have an surprisingly good sound system inside.  A few times I went in and they were playing some classic rock over great sounding speakers."}
{"text":"I've ordered 5 times now from this Jimmyder John's, I live close by they deliver one sandwich within 10 minutes very good service sandwiches are what you expect to see Jimmy John's sandwich not bad nothing special my last order? the manager was kind enough to tell me the driver was out and wihen they get back my order would be go out,  still got my sandwich for the time it would take to deliver a pizza great service"}
{"text":"I didn't like JJ at first. I got the tuna sandwich plus avocado and it just didn't do it for me. I'll stick to making my own loaded tuna sandwiches.  Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I owed my coworker lunch and I know Jimmy Johns is one of his favs so I offer it to him and check out the menu for myself: I ended up picking the roast beef sandwich, left the center of the bread in, added avocado, went EZ on the hot peppers and onion, and took off the tomato, kept the cheese and the mayo. It didn't take them too long to get to us.  When I sunk my teeth into this, all my past convictions about JJ were thrown out. This was a good, goooood roast beef sandwich. A plus is that we are in range for them to deliver to us when we are at work.   I've had the exact same order three times since then and I haven't lost my love for it yet. Here's to next time!"}
{"text":"This location is great. I ordered a Vito sandwich via phone at 11:55 am for delivery and my sandwich was in my hands by 12:03 pm . Amazing delivery service and supreme tasting gourmet sub. Thanks jimmy johns"}
{"text":"We just moved to a new office and sadly my car is out of service and I am waiting for m new car to be done. Anyways I went online to order lunch and didnt want pizza or any of that crap, found JJ score!! I ordered online, fast , easy, and dont have to talk to anyone. Not even 10 mins the front desk calls to say my lunch is here ! I love JJ food is good a sandwich is a sandwich not sure why people bitch that its not subway, subway sucks and its nasty food. Jimmys is the way to go, fresh meat and made quick. If you're complaining about it not being subway go back to subway and eat your processed meat that has no nutrients. PS Subways lettuce is horrendous!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed with this JJs. Usually I get a heaping portion of condiments on my  #4 but this one lacks substance. I was not upset when they told me that the only cheese they carried was provolone, but I could tell my wife was paturbed when they still weren't carrying sprouts to put on her #6.   Step up your game JJ on Baseline and Country Club. You are have a lot of work to do if you want to match up the JJs off Dobson."}
{"text":"Fantastic location! Never have gotten my order wrong! I think Xenia R. and Jose R. probably didn't order correctly because I have NEVER had an issue with this location! I will be back multiple times! Great that they deliver as well!"}
{"text":"So, they are fast just like they claim. However their food is not that spectacular. I ordered a sandwich on whole wheat bread. One of the pieces of bread was the heel of the loaf not to mention that the bread was stale. This is not the first time I've received stale bread from this location. I ordered extra sprouts on the sandwich as well, and there were barely any on the sand. I guess that's an improvement over last time when I ordered  sprouts and got none. Fast is not always better."}
{"text":"Fast delivery but horrible customer service. The guy who answered the phone was rude on the phone when I asked if they had dessert. He even hung up the phone on me when I had more questions!!"}
{"text":"Very close at night.  Also very stingy with the avocado.  It totally depends on who's working there will shape your experience!!  I hope management is listening to this feedback."}
{"text":"Went in to order for a party and it seems that Bobbie the assistant manager really didn't know how or what to do... I left feeling yucky so I called back the next day to the general manager first off when someone asks are you the manager it would be really nice for you to introduce yourself in a professional manner and even maybe attempt to turn down your blaring music in the background to maybe help me out also maybe ask me why I was cancelling my order maybe try to remedy the situation maybe just maybe try to keep my business but no she was rude and short and didn't care at all that my order was cancelled.... Honestly if she showed a ounce of concern I would continued with my order won't be going back to this location sorry."}
{"text":"Great food.  Subway is just so tired compared to JJ's   You'll never look at Subways after a Jimmy Johns.  I would normally say 5 stars for food, today's delivery was 27 minutes and we are close."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch today trying to give them the benefit of the doubt even though they screwed up at least 2 prior orders but today I have finally said enough and will no longer be a customer of Jimmy John's they have let their service go incredibly down hill it is disappointing. I get I ordered a slim but there is not even enough meat to cover the bread... Come on. When I occasionally order chips or a drink they always manage to forget it. If you asked for mustard or mayo packets stop holding your breath they barely remember the stuff you pay for. Not to mention one time I ordered it toke 2 HOURS..... the manager was no real help just kept saying another 15 minutes and when I would call back he would say 15 minutes again. I would highly suggest getting a management team in there that can turn that place around."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Went in today between classes for a quick meal with some good nutrients- opted for the Beach Club on 9 Grain Wheat Bread: Turkey breast, provolone cheese, avocado spread, sliced cucumber, lettuce, tomato, mayo (I got no mayo, added dijon mustard and some light italian dressing).  BOMB. I had to scarf it down because I had to go to class so was a bit disappointed I wasn't able to fully enjoy it, but it was delicious.  I wasn't familiar with Jimmy John's until today, but what they say is true- These people are so friendly and welcoming. Right when I walked in the door, everyone warmly greeted me and I got my sandwich very quickly for $7 including tax.  If you're craving a great sandwich at a bargain and friendly customer service- Check it out."}
{"text":"LOVE Jimmy Johns! Employees seem very enthusiastic!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. WAY too much mayo... bad bread... overall just not that great. If you want a good sub go to Jersey Mikes - Their subs are amazing!"}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious, & they deliver!! Great for where ever you are on campus, online ordering & FAST!!"}
{"text":"I go to this Jimmy John's at least once per week. It is always exactly what you expect. The food is consistent, served quickly and they never make an error. The peppers are an excellent add-on for those that like a little kick."}
{"text":"So disappointed by the new bread! Old JJ's bread was the reason I came back. New bread is like a stale, dense hamburger bun. No longer worth it, try Potbelly's across the street."}
{"text":"We ordered the 16 The Club Lulu and the # 4 the Turkey Tom The #4 Was ok but...  The #16 Club Lulu added guacamole spread. However I got my sandwich missing bacon. Bacon is 1/2 of what makes up that sandwich. BIG fail."}
{"text":"We usually love Jimmy Johns because of how delicious and quick the sandwiches come out. The staff seemed a little uninterested but it was toward the end of the day so they may have been a little tired. Regardless we had great sandwiches and we will continue to eat there."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Wanted to order the Slim 5 but add a dressing and was told i couldn't. They said it is Jimmy Johns rule. Well if i can't customize my sandwich then i will eat else where. And that is just what my group did. Went across the street to a different sub place and was able to customize my order to my needs.  I will say one employee did say yes. Then the \"guy on power trip\" behind the counter said no. So from now on will use other places for events etc."}
{"text":"I was in the plaza driving through to get to Lowes when one of the delivery drivers came through the parking lot and did not stop at the stop sign. He almost crashed head on. From there I pulled in front of him to try to get out onto the street and stopped for a couple of seconds to drop someone off. He then honked at me, drove into the oncoming traffic lane, just to swerve to be in front of my car. Almost cause 2 accidents. Very bad drivers."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave less than one star for this store. I placed an order on their website, for this exact store for delivery, and either my order was misplaced, never recognized, or just plain ignored, almost more than an hour and a half ago. I figured because it is lunchtime on a busy weekday that the delay was part of it. Only to find my order was misplaced and never accounted for. When I spoke to the store manager about the misunderstanding / miscommunication nothing was taken care of. And her carelessness is the point of why I'm taking the time to write this review. I am upset & expected more from a store manager."}
{"text":"I order delivery from this location all the time. The sandwiches are great, standard Jimmy Johns goodness that we all love, but the delivery almost always takes 15-20 minutes. That wouldn't be a big deal, except I live less than a mile away. I don't know why every time it takes so long, but the food is good and the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"This particular location is either run by 15 year olds or a bunch of stoners. Literally every time I order from here they forget an item (or 3) and sometimes bring the wrong thing all together (like the wrong flavor of soda or cookie).  I have called for refunds multiple times and I have also sent drivers back to the store for the rest of my order more than once.  Why do I keep ordering from here? I suppose I keep hoping they will get it together! Plus, sometimes, the food is actually \"freaky fast\".   Staff-- sloooow down and read the tickets. That is all."}
{"text":"They were incredibly rude and short on the phone. Refused to deliver to a HOSPITAL during business hours, even though the nurses said they delivered all the time. Made it clear they couldn't be bothered to take our order. I guess in the future they can't be bothered to have any of our business. Will never order from this location agian."}
{"text":"That was quick. I'm not even sure what is on my sandwich. All I did was order. Paid money. Got change. Filled my drink. Sandwich done! Out the door like a champ..."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great staff, and super quick service! This is the perfect lunch spot if you're in a hurry but do not want to skimp on quality! Great job JJs"}
{"text":"They get it done- not sure what's freaky fast about delivery- I waited 30mims for them to show up last night- anyhow- it was $9, so fuck it"}
{"text":"Well had an order delivered, they didn't cut it in half like I requested, they forgot my chips, and a straw for my drink. As well as no napkins?  So I called them, first guy picked up and then hung up on me. So I called back, spoke to a rude guy on the phone. I told him I didn't get what I paid for. Also asked for some napkins. His only response was \"napkins are special order\". Okay, figured that would be a curtesy. Regardless, you didn't bring my complete order. Last time I use jimmy johns."}
{"text":"I wish I wasn't lazy today because then I could have gotten a sub that actually tastes good and when I ask for extra mayo they actually put it on there. I'm basically eating bread and meat. I'll stick to jersey mikes from now on."}
{"text":"I wasn't done paying for the sub and they were done making it!! Truly freaky fast and a great sub!"}
{"text":"Tried to place a gift order from this \"freaky fast\" outfit, to be delivered 4 miles away.  \"Sorry, not in our area.\" WOW!  Big game killer can't even deliver 4 miles away!  Really knew better than to go there!"}
{"text":"I understand this location being in such a busy place where I'm sure their lunch service is always insane M-F. I also understand nothing can ever be perfect, nor should we expect 100% in anything, but MAN I'd sure like to have my order correct at least once! It's when you add extras like hot peppers that everything falls apart, which are such a KEY ingredient, meaning their absence can really change the sandwich for someone. Our firm always orders for lunch because they DO deliver, and we can seldom get away...oh and they are \"freaky fast\" (sometimes they are...but when they are not...it's like...years...)  The food? It's just fine and gets the job done. Ingredients are certainly fresh here with such high volume! Love it,  though I order the same thing every time and manage to eat something different every time. The service? There's one group of people that are in there sometimes and they are all so nice and friendly, very attentive, and make sure you are being taken care of. Then sometimes you walk in and it's the \"other\" group of people that couldn't care less. Let's mix these people up a little bit, I'm rolling the dice as it is with this place, I can't handle more variables.   2 Stars because every other Jimmy John's in the valley nails it consistently. I believe they can improve. The All-Stars of JJ's should be the ones coming here to work, and be bred for higher positions. This place gets busy."}
{"text":"I honestly love coming here! The music is always good when I'm here and the staff are friendly! I love knowing you can get a whole pickle to go with your sandwich rather than 3 or 4 pieces. One of the managers, Cody, is really cool to have conversations with! A word to the wise, my boyfriend tried using his active gift card and they just got a new card reader that didn't read the gift card. We literally had everyone trying to manually input and work their magic for it, but no dice. Having said that, have an alternative form of payment ready in case this happens to you! Overall, good experience as usual with this location!"}
{"text":"We're in town for business and we're sick, so we wanted to get something delivered to our hotel room. We love jimmy johns so we were happy to see they'd deliver to us. The delivery was quick and they got our order right, but as we were eating our sandwiches, we both noticed that there was a really bitter taste in both of our sandwiches. The lettuce was bad. My husband called to tell them and they were apologetic, but when he asked to speak to the manager about it, the employee just said \"yeah I'll discuss with the manager and let you know\" and hung up without taking our name or number or anything.  Sooo basically I don't think they really care. ?"}
{"text":"Not sue of the official open date but I noticed it open on 8/30!   I've been patently waiting for a Jimmy Johns in this area! Thank you for opening a location here.   Food was delivered in 14 minutes. Pretty damn good.  Bread - FRESH Toppings - FRESH & not sparse Meats - Delicious!  I ordered online so I cannot review the customer service on the in store setting."}
{"text":"I have been consistently ordering from this location for a few years now and they are usually on point with the order.  To me, it is easier to just call the order in than navigate the online ordering system, which to me can be quite cumbersome compared to other online ordering tools for food.  Other than that, the food is always fresh and it usually (and I mean usually) it comes within 15 minutes to my door after ordering it.  This is why I chose to give four stars instead of five.  There have been times that I ordered food and it took longer than an hour for it to arrive at my residence.  With that being said, maybe they were understaffed or super busy on those days, but overall this location does an excellent job and I will be sure to order from them again the next time the urge for a good sandwich hits me."}
{"text":"First time having their sandwich without the bun! Pretty amazing if you ask me! I think it was fresh & hearty! I got the turkey bacon & mayo! It was very filling & fresh & Id go back again without question !"}
{"text":"Horrible service, bad attitudes by workers. They actually refused to put two sandwiches and chips into a bag and asked me to do it! Will never go back here again!!!!"}
{"text":"Great alternative to pizza for late night cheap eats. Delivery is extremely quick which is great for getting a quick bite to eat before succumbing to the alcohol induced slumber. Sodium levels seem to be moderate even though the meat isn't the best. I recommend substituting the regular white roll for wheat sandwich bread if your looking for something a bit healthier."}
{"text":"Of course they are freaky fast. As well as having great customer service. Anytime I go in I am always impressed."}
{"text":"Getting our quick jimmy john's fix. All sandwiches are hella good here. Always fresh as you order. I love this place. No matter sandwich you get, you can't never go wrong. Fast service is always a plus. It's better than subway, just saying."}
{"text":"Went here after a stressful day at the hospital. Getting subs to take back to the hospital. They were fast but they couldn't even put them in a bag!!! We had to bag them ourselves. Really!!! Poorest customer service I've had in a long time.  We'll be coming to the hospital for awhile but we won't be getting our food from here again!!!"}
{"text":"Our office orders here weekly. Today I called to place my order as usual and my card was ran, ok. We needed to add bacon to one of the sandwiches and I was asked to hold on. I asked how much it was and he said, like a dollar. Alright, I'll just pay for that in cash. Again, asked to hold on. They couldn't do this. My card would have to be voided and re ran for the new amount. I asked how long would it take for my credit then on the original transaction? I was asked to hold on again, then I was told 3-5 days. What? Why can I not just pay cash for the bacon? I am asked to hold on, I could hear a guy in the back round say it needs to be on a receipt...sooo, why can that not be added to a receipt? I ended up cancelling my whole order. We seriously order here 90% of every week....super annoyed and disappointed, over a dollar!"}
{"text":"Worst jimmy Johns experience! The staff acted like it was a problem to serve me, like I was interrupting their free time. I ordered a turkey and cheese with mayo. They gave me turkey on bread no cheese and threw mayo packets at me. I had to ask for it to be bagged and they just tossed a bag at me ! Shit food shit customer service!!! I'll never be back !"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great location. I haven't noticed any problems with the music at all. They are characteristically fast, I'm in and out in 5 mins. The one issue I've noticed is that the ice dispenser gets jammed, but that's not a big deal to me. I get consitently good product and that outweighs any little inconvenience."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns more than most people and since I've moved to the Phoenix area I can't seem to work or live in an area they deliver to.  I am 1.6 miles away and can't get delivery."}
{"text":"I usually love Jimmy Johns, however this particular location was awful!! The service wasn't great, ran by a bunch of young boys. Yes fast, but the sandwich itself was sad. The bread was so hard I couldn't even eat it. Oh, and there are no sprouts at this particular location...lol ok."}
{"text":"First time at Jimmy John's. Please tell me this situation was just a lazy employee and not a company policy.   I took an extended lunch the bring my wife and kids lunch. So I ordered three sandwiches to-go. The woman just piled the sandwiches up on the counter. I said, \"These were to go.\" Insinuating I needed a bag. Pointing, she said, \"There's bags right there. This is self-serve.\"   Look, I'm not a crippled, I'm more than capable of putting some sandwiches in a bag. It was the shock of no other company, especially fast food, makes their customers bag their own stuff. Just throw the sandwiches on the counter and have at it. But it was also that I'd never been there and didn't know this was even a thing for them. Where are the bags at? Etc. But it was also her attitude. The \"I give two shits about you\" attitude. Just bag it for the customer, lady. There was one table of three women dining, me and one lady in line. It was not busy at all.  For a company that prides themselves on being freaky fast, this was not an example of that. Especially if your customers are forced to bag their own sandwiches. This was either bad company policy or simply a really lazy employee."}
{"text":"The food is delicious,  however I will drive out of my way to a different location based solely on the customer service here. The employee who took my order was rude and snooty, made me feel very unwelcome. It then took 3 other employees on the sandwich line over 5 minutes to prepare my small order.. so much for \"freaky fast\". While these employees were kinder and apologized for the wait, I still left feeling that this was one of the only times I've left a JJ's disappointed. I'd hate to see this place when it's actually busy,  as I was the only customer they were attending to at the time."}
{"text":"I would give this place 6 stars if I could. If your looking for a quality, inexpensive, healthy meal this is your place. Its quick, they are always very friendly, and their bread is amazing. Its about the same price as subway only the bread is a million times better and the ingredients aren't all limp.  The only thing that I don't like is sometimes they deliver to my house, and other times they tell me \"they don't deliver out in my area.\" Well I live about a miles away from there and if you have delivered 10 times and I've tipped very well you would come again? Oh well the drive is worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a message for the owner of this location. Bruh you got I driver out trying to deliver a freaky fast freaky fresh sub but it is not fast at all. You got home boy out there in the rain with a grip of sandwiches in his car because orders keep coming and he got 10 min to deliver. This place is a disgrace to the Jimmy John's franchise and I blame the owner not the staff because the staff is polite and they are trying hard from what I can tell. You got one driver out at dinner time are you kidding me.  Some time later-  Initially I was told by the woman taking my order that I would be credited $10 to my account I recently tried ordering a sandwich and no such credit existed in their history and now I'm hangry"}
{"text":"My company recently spent almost $200.00 here for a business meeting. We won't be doing that again! First of all, after spending that much money we did not even get napkins or plates. When we asked about it our delivery guy informed us that they are not allowed to provide these necessary items unless specifically asked to. We have a lot of food catered here and we have never had to ask for napkins and plates when we order food for such a large group of people. Very stingy!   As for the food quality - the bread seemed slightly stale and hard. There was a half of 1 piece of meat for the ham and turkey sandwiches. Also 1 small piece of cheese here and there on  the sandwiches. And the lettuce that was thrown on the sandwiches was not only sparse, but considering the lack of other ingredients, it was also overpowering. Was almost like we were eating lettuce sandwiches.   For almost $200.00 we were expecting much much more."}
{"text":"tasty treats.  in the form of glorified subway or quizno's.  not toasted, but of the deli style sandwich type.  and the 'wiches are pretty big, apparently, according to a waif like co-worker. i, however, ate my whole sandwich with no problem. apparently i'm more a heffer than i ever thought.  jimmy john's.  making america heffers one sandwich at a time."}
{"text":"Thought we'd give them another try. Slowest jimmy johns ever. 45 minutes later and still not here."}
{"text":"HEAVEN IS A NUMBER 9.  Wow, what a sandwich and it is reasonable.  This place BLOWS Jersey Mikes away.  The people that work at Jimmy John's are very, very nice."}
{"text":"They don't have their hours posted and no open sign.   I rolled up to buy a sandwich and drop it off for my wife before I left the area, the lights were on a guy inside the music on so I thought it was open. I grabbed the door handle to pull and just about broke my hand cause it was locked! I looked up and couldn't find an \"Open\" sign soooo next thing I thought what are the hours of this establishment...... they don't have any hours. Buddy inside saw me but choose to ignore me instead of maybe telling when they where open. Off to Capriotti's I went."}
{"text":"The Unwitches were unbelievably delicious - thanks guys!  We'll be sure to stop next time we pass thru."}
{"text":"I have had issues with different jimmy johns locations in the past, and this is the first time i have ordered from this location and they were great!! I ordered online and within 10 minutes they were at my door! The delivery driver was a very nice young man. The bread, meat, and cheese all tasted very fresh! Thank you to this location for restoring my faith in jimmy johns! I will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Very speedy service and a well-made sandwich. I'm frequently in the Burgh for work and my office is super close to here. Most days, I try and do a \"working lunch\".  I can get a tasty, healthy and filling meal here for cheap - in and out of the store in (at the absolute most) 10 minutes.  For what I'm looking for, this is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Ive been eating here almost everyday the last 2 weeks I love the roast beef slims and the delivery does not disappoint it is freaky fast!! Highy recommended."}
{"text":"I'm not necessarily posting about this location in general, just this past experience that I have had. I placed an order online for my co-worker and I, the vito, the BLT and a bag of the thinny chips I waited around the office for about an hour, when it usually take between 15-20 minutes because my office is about 1.25 miles away from this location. I called in and talked to the manager (whose name I didn't catch) and asked him about my sandwiches, and he put my on hold while he talked to his driver. He gets back on the phone and asked if I worked at the Intel Building, to which I responded no, and he mentioned that the driver took the sandwiches to that building. My work building is hard to find, so I really wasn't upset with that portion, because it's an honest mistake. That building has the same address number, but it's still about a block and a half away. The manager was really nice, and said he would replace our order, send it over ASAP and also give me two free sandwiches. Which was super thoughtful, because it was an honest mistake, and I didn't ask for them, he just offered.  Another 30 minutes go by, and our driver finally comes, hands me the sandwich, and I tipped with cash. I go to the break room and open the bag to realize that both sandwiches are there, but the chips are not. The chips are only $1.50 a bag, so while I'm not super concerned with them not being delivered-- I did pay for them, and they weren't here during the second delivery. The receipt was not attached to my bag, and neither was the notice for two free sandwiches or whatever else. Again, not super disappointed about the two free sandwiches (like the manager had offered), because I wasn't expecting the coupon, I was just expecting my order to be delivered and correct.  Again, I order from this Jimmy John's a lot, so I'm not super mad or going to stop using them, this was just a pretty annoying experience."}
{"text":"I'll try to keep this short enough so that you can read my review in the time it takes them to make a sandwich...  Super friendly (expect every employee to greet you when you enter) Super fast (so fast you'll freak, as they say).  In fact I parked behind one of the delivery vehicles and my first thought was that I was able to be attacked when I heard this dude sprinting from the store to his truck. Super yummy - I get the vegetarian sandwich, no cucumber.  It has a nice zesty avocado spread.  PS. Minus one star as the Phoenix-area locations don't serve any of their sandwiches with sprouts (contrary to the menu)."}
{"text":"Excellent service, the staff was bubbly and welcoming. The store itself was clean and so close to home. THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"This place gets 1 star simply because they only deliver until 9pm. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME???!!!?!? This is Vegas ....and you are on campus!! What a joke. I am a long time customer of jimmy johns and where I'm from they deliver on campus until 4am.... Take the fucking hint jimmy johns LV!!!"}
{"text":"Franky, this shop is lucky not to get a 2 star rating from me. Basically it's because I was not impressed with the service. I heard many good things about this chain but other than the sandwich being pretty good, I never saw that one thing that would make it overly unique. I had the Italian sub and was somewhat disappointed that they only have white bread. The sub as I said was good but could have used a little more zip in the dressing. I was handed my sandwich quickly at the counter - the speed impressed me but was not asked if I would like anything else and given no napkins - I had to search for them. I base my score on the product over the service. I'm fairly certain this isn't common practice.  Recommend: MEDIUM"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm not usually the biggest fan of the food at Jimmy John's, but I just ordered online and I was just blown away by how speedy the service was! My order was processed via email in seconds and ready to pick up in less than 10 minutes! Very convenient. Good job."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered- there was a LONG BLACK HAIR IN MY SANDWICH. It looked like it was spread into the bread along with the mayo... Sticking out end to end- gross!  I have a weird thing about HAIR being in my food so I literally stopped ordering there for several months until... Second time I ordered- haunted by the \"hair incident\" I asked for mayo packets instead of the spread and even wrote a note in my order saying \"please don't forget mayo packets!!!\". I also ordered a drink and chips. Sandwich was delivered WITHOUT mayo packets or spread, NO chips and NO drink. I called the manager to ask for a refund for the chips and drink. He said he processed the refund and sent the driver to deliver the items anyway, free of charge. Never got the chips/drink and still haven't seen refund come thru, even after leaving messages for the manager. This was 2 weeks ago."}
{"text":"These are the worst sandwiches that I have ever seen or eaten.  Subway is way better, and that's not saying much.  They have very little meat.  If you order guacamole, you can't even find it on the sandwich, let alone taste it.  They have ONE cheese selection, ONE onion selection...etc.    Why does anyone say these sandwiches are great???   They are horrible.   If you want a real sandwich go to a Deli...which out here in AZ is very rare, but then so are the good sandwiches.  Don't waste your money.  If I could give 0 stars I would, but they don't let you."}
{"text":"The best thing to happen to the northwest side of town. The staff are so friendly. The restaurant so clean. Highly recommend the lettuce wrap sandwiches."}
{"text":"Food is great. My last order was delivered in 9 minutes. Don't ask me how.   Now I have to write a little bit more in order to make this a review, but I shouldn't have to. Jimmy John's is a fast, efficient place, and so was my review before I had to write all this."}
{"text":"My husband got food poisoning here 2 days ago. So bad he had to be hospitalized because he was throwing up for over 24 hours. Dont stop here like we did. Keep walking."}
{"text":"Ordered a sandwich to for delivery, $12, tipped $5 for a total of $17. But my statement showed a total of $22. Called and spoke to a manager and he said he'd fix it but it never got done. Came in to the store a week later and spoke to the onsite manager, Nicole. She helped me immediately end called the corporate billing center and said she'd make sure it would be fixed and would personally call me to notify me. Sure enough she called and it got corrected. 5 stars for Nicole. 1 star for everything. 3 star average :)"}
{"text":"So I asked for a sandwich with no tomato and I received the sandwich without tomato but it had much oil on it, it was dry on the inside. Thanks For the soggy mess."}
{"text":"awesome! quality subs at a freaky fast speed. great choice when i'm stuck at work with no sack lunch."}
{"text":"Company told me they don't deliver to my house..Called the other one on Dobson and southern and same thing..keep calling in circles..I gave up!!!  Who delivers to my house..why have commercials and advertisements..if your company lies"}
{"text":"I want pickle on my sandwich.  It's not difficult or expensive.  Literally every other sandwich shop IN THE WORLD offers pickles as a FREE option.  The fact that they wanted to charge me today for PICKLES is completely INSANE and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Prett pathetic place. They are the closest to me for delivery and they won't even go suggested I come and pick up...what's the point of having delivery if I am in their delivery area and the delivery area of the of their restaurants and not one will deliver. Used to love going but now I won't"}
{"text":"Seriously I have two jimmy johns the same distance from me and neither will deliver. To me that's just a pathetic excuse to be lazy."}
{"text":"The food is good, for fast food sub shop, and it does come out fast.  The person waiting on us could have ended their phone call instead of just telling them to wait until she took our order. Not very professional, but it is a fast food place and I guess I shouldn't expect much in regards to service."}
{"text":"Count on stale bread at this location . Lots of stale bread, not much fillings on the inside.  The Rancho/Charleston location is definitely 5 stars.  This falls flat with a 1."}
{"text":"Hey jimmy... I don't know why john hasn't talk to you, but holy crap you said you weren't busy so around the corner shouldn't be a issue(I order form you all the time) thank you for letting me rundown after your delivery driver who didn't stop. Or return my phone call. Again thank you. No subs for me!!!"}
{"text":"If you are a submarine fan and haven't tried jersey mikes you need to go!  Best sub out there quality meats and cheeses with truly excellent bread. Sliced while you wait with lots of choices. More expensive than many but worth it."}
{"text":"Bad customer service recently!  They stop delivering to you after they get you hooked."}
{"text":"I'm 2.5 miles away. I asked to place an order for delivery and they said I was out of range. Wtf"}
{"text":"Worker definitely gave me less sandwich filling than normal for sliced wheat and charged me for a cup of water. Never really had a problem at this location, but they train employees there and maybe this late but employee was new. Just don't come here for late night food and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this location after travelling and not eating. Normally JJ is very fast delivery wise, and it took them about 35 minutes to deliver which is not typical but still not too bad. The driver was nice and we got our food. It was decent, but nowhere near as good as some of the other locations I have eaten at. Still a good quick food option!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and we really liked it! I had the Totally Tuna and the bf had the Supreme something (can't remember the name of it) but we both enjoyed our hoagies. I'm going back today for lunch actually lol"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! They have bugs in the lettuce!!!! It was brought to their attention and they REFUSED to do anything about it. They even tried to tell me the bug must have somehow flew into the middle of a wrapped sandwich and that it couldn't have possibly have been from them. It was in the middle of the sandwich and the manager proceeded to blow it off like its no big deal!!!! GROSS!!!!"}
{"text":"People that work here have no sense or good customer service. Forget about placing any phone orders here. I was trying to place an order for 8 people and had to repeat names and orders 3 times before they got it. Then after we finally go the food, half of the orders were wrong! How can a place like this still stay in business. Suggestion to management: invest in better training and customer service. My company will NEVER order from here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered a #4 and requested to add salami & cheese. Drove 15 minutes home to find a salami sandwich. When I called to let them know, the girl on the phone said \"I don't know what to tell you because I made the sandwich so I know it has turkey.\" I said \"I'm looking at it and unwrapped it myself so I don't think it fell out.\" And she replied in a condescending way \"You must have gotten the wrong sand which then.\"  As if I'm going to call you to get a refund on 2 slices of turkey.   Horrible customer service skills. Train your staff properly on handling your loyal customers."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? I found out about Jimmy Johns in my college town, open real late was perfect for those late night cravings but you wanted something a bit more healthy than McDonald's or Cookout. The price is good, you can get a sub for around 5 dollars. The main thing I like about JJ is that they make it super fast. One time I ordered and just finished paying and my sub was already ready! I always get the Beach Club, Vito, or the Club LULU. Wow, I think I might go get one now."}
{"text":"Overall I like JJ's sandwiches.   Tonight I was doing a job at nearby COCOs and wanted to eat while listening to president spew his diatribe.   I called JJ and ordered a sandwich for pickup.   When the girl asked \"Cash or Credit Card\" I replied \"Cash\" and she promptly hung up on me without saying \"good bye\" or anything else.   When I got there they were so messed up that they had to re-enter the order to avoid delivery charges and I still had to wait while the girl made the sandwich.   She placed it on the counter while I was getting my drink and I had to reach over the counter into the employee area just to get my own napkins.   This place DOES need some \"grown-up\" supervision."}
{"text":"Unprofessional and more concerned about chatting with each other than taking my order.  (There were about 10 JJ's staff there when I arrived, four or more of them on the customer side of the counter.)  The cashier had a bandaged hand and was understandably slow at making change but his slow response to take my order does not follow the \"freaky fast\" plan.  While I was waiting for my order I stood by the window and looked around at messy tables, a soda machine that needed attention and a dirty floor.  With all of that staff standing around doesn't it make sense that somebody should be cleaning?!  The one bright spot was a female employee who really seemed genuinely concerned about getting my order made and to me in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"The teenagers working here are not capable of handling any complaints. I asked for no onions on an Italian club and instead they put no sauce. I brought it back and all they said is we can pick off the onions for you.. No I don't want you digging through my sandwich with your hands. Just make me a new sandwich how I ordered it. Can't believe how bad their customer service is, the lady behind me ordered a club lulu and they gave her a club tuna and said that's what she ordered. The kids working here need to develop customer service skills or they need a manager here that actually cares about guest concerns. Neither of us got comped anything not even a soda. Instead all we got are eye rolls for something that was their fault. Maybe if they turned down their horrible music they could hear the orders correctly."}
{"text":"Poor service!  Nobody talks to you or offers service.  It's as if once you pay, you are just an annoyance."}
{"text":"The online ordering is very easy to use and a great way to make your sandwich perfect. And it is just like the commercials say. Very fast delivery."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much writing this review because, after I went to Dave's Cosmic Subs I realized how much BETTER Jimmy John's is than Dave's. And that's sorta scary because Jimmy John's is so...generic and mass-produced.  But I freaking love their sandwiches! I don't know how else to explain it. For no real reason, my mouth waters every time I think about the Turkey Tom sandwich. I think the bread tastes great although I know some would disagree. It's definitely crisper than Subway, which is a big plus in my book because Subway sandwiches get too mushy after ten minutes. Forget about saving half a Subway sandwich in the fridge for lunch tomorrow. Not happening. You'll throw it out.  I kinda wish there were other bread options at Jimmy's other than the sub and the whole-grain bread, but on the other hand, I wouldn't want to mess with a good thing.  Maybe I'm so used to using grody Light mayo on all my sandwiches at home, that when I come here and get full-on Hellman's from mutant tubs, it just soothes me in a way I can't explain.  I'm gonna do it now:  Nom nom.   Sorry!"}
{"text":"For a chain sub sandwich joint it hits the spot, I was surprised with how much I really liked it. . Fresh bread that isn't too thick and 8 inch's is perfect. Better meat and more meat than subway. Good ingredients and it all tasted really fresh. They're sub choices are good but, wish they had more selection but, it's probably how they keep the prices down.  Also they have what they call slim sandwiches, which is any sub without all the produce and fixings. Works out great for my kids and cheaper. You can also order any sub locarb, instead of bread it's all wrapped up in lettuce."}
{"text":"This store is always super fast and makes the sandwiches just as ordered! They ran a few minutes behind and threw in extra cookies as a bonus. My husband prefers them over pizza/fast food simply because of the freshness and quality."}
{"text":"Went in to jjs  and ordered 43 dollars worth of food for my family along with 2 bags of chips. The lady at the counter gave me my food but did NOT give me my chips. I went home (5 miles away) and looked in the box and realized that the chips that I paid for were not there. I called up jjs  and asked to have the chips refunded to my card. The man put me on hold for more than 14 mins. And then hung up on me. So I called back and a lady answered and had told me that it was my fault that I didn't have the chips and she \" cant refund me\" I don't usually review but the people that worked there don't want to make it right and give me back my money for items that I did not get.  And on a side note do not get the BLT . Unfortunately it is 90% lettus  I would have gone somehwere  else if I knew I was going to be paying 43 dollars for bread and lettus"}
{"text":"Update: The morning crew definitely redeemed their store for me. Everything was perfect and came freaky fast. I really enjoy jimmy johns so I am happily writing this update! 12/19  I've tried to hold back but no more. I work at the front desk of a condo 4 minutes from this location and not once has my order gone as freaky fast or as smoothly as it should have. From hard bread to waiting over an hour for my sandwich, I probably won't ever order from this JJ's again. I've tried to be patient. This store needs new employees and better management. Assistant managers have always been great but somewhere in between there needs to be a change. Even got a credit for getting the hard bread...just received my free sandwich, hard bread yet again. 11/16"}
{"text":"Best thing about jimmy john's is they deliver to my work. Subs are very bland & little less than average. But I'd order there again purely for delivery convenience"}
{"text":"This place is just wonderful!!  I'm not even much of a sandwich fan, but this Jimmy John's changed my perspective.  I wasn't sure what to order, but Erika was so helpful!!  She recommended one of her favorites, and I must say she has great judgement.  Great food, amazing customer service, and a great atmosphere.  Now I crave sandwiches from there. Thank you, Jimmy John's!  :)"}
{"text":"My first experience here at this location was lousy. Loud music, unfriendly employees and a bad sandwich (Italian). I went back a year later, last week - same location - SAME thing. I don't even think the bread is fresh. It's so loud in there with the music blaring that you can't hold a conversation. Employees are mostly teens who don't give a crap and the food is nothing special. Even the cookies were lousy. Not fresh baked or anything."}
{"text":"Delivery time is extremely inconsistent. 9/10 times my delivery is late. Today it took 1hr 10 min for my order."}
{"text":"Good place to stop and grab something quick to eat if you are on the run! They have so many variations but they could come up with a \"make your own\" that would be awesome! But it's fairly cheap and everyone there is very friendly and it's very fast! I've had it delivered and it doesn't take long at all! Less then 10 minutes and it's there! It's amazing! I would recommend to everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Didn't know they are so high energy and happy. That was a surprise. Wheat bread is soft and moist very good."}
{"text":"Staff was great, service was fast, but the food was sub par. Ordered a BLT and there were two pieces of bacon. Two. On an 8\" sub, so basically I paid for a lettuce and mayo sandwich. The other sandwiches that we ordered were okay but one was missing cheese and the other was dripping with mayo. Can honestly say that we won't be going back there."}
{"text":"I PREFER TO GIVE IT NO STARS, QUALITY WAS.....welll their was no quality as for the stale bread(\"fresh baked\") the rotten soggy tomatoes, dried up meats, and dirty tasting lettuce id say we need to get this place inspected!! JIMMY JOHN THIS PLACE IS DOING YOU WRONG! PS who ever took my order was a douche bag."}
{"text":"Just moved here and we would have loved to of ordered some sandwiches from this place for delivery... but apparently my address is .1 mile outside of their range!very strange it shows I'm less than 5 min drive.. if I owned this franchise location I would be furious, they didn't even ask how many sandwiches I wanted to order, or offer to walk to the neighbors house at the corner.. good luck if your staff is so unwilling to take orders for you.."}
{"text":"They live up to their promise, speedy service. Not the best subs in the area but definitely a favorite of ours. My wife typically gets the turkey Tom or the veggie sub while I usually stick to the Vito with hot peppers.  Combo meal usually comes in around $7-8 with a drink and chips and you get your order in less than 5 minutes which is great. Glad this location has a drive thru on the north facing side of the road, convenient to pick up on my way home."}
{"text":"Good customer service and friendly conversational employees."}
{"text":"2 stars for delivery time and nice biker.  0 stars for food. That sandwich tasted like the Arizona dirt that sticks to my feet.   Would not recommend food from here. It was pricey too. I had no cheese on my sandwich, nothing is baked, super dry. Seriously if you work hard for your money I wouldn't eat here. Turkey was thinner than pre packed at the store."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's catered our working lunch today & they delivered super-fast   1 Veggie Sub option.....guess what I chose   Mostly lettuce & overall, pretty darn bland - tasted no avocado although I saw a slight greenish schmeer. Tomatoes were very thin & didn't add a lot of flavor. It was supposed to have \"layers\" of Provolone - I think I saw 1. The fact there were lots of sprouts was very nice!   Bread was nice & soft - but also mysteriously bland. The sandwich was filling so at least we had that.  Chips are nice & crunchy.    Others got the Vito Sub (Italian), Turkey Tom, & whatnot - their go-to picks - they love 'em   This is a usual sandwich stop for my Charlotte crew..... I might have to give it a pass & instead opt for alternative veggie choices, but would be willing to try then again to give it a fair shot  .....maybe next time I'd see if any hot peppers made a difference   At this point, I have to say, sorry guys but I've experienced better"}
{"text":"Delivery area has increased. Smart business move. Have ordered a few times since and have had no issues. Prices are good."}
{"text":"Very fast actually freaked out a little was done before I got to the pick up line. Best service so far at a jimmy johns"}
{"text":"So Jimmy John's is a sub place that has a fast service theme. They are pretty quick for how busy they get. However the food isn't what I'd call good. I feel like the sandwiches are lacking character and flavor. While better than Subway it's not nearly as good as any number of non-chain sandwich places in the area such the Hero Factory or the Downtown Deli which are both great establishments. Jimmy John's is far from gourmet and I almost feel like having a sign up that mentions gourmet is just wrong on several levels. If you walk down to the area on lunch break from work or jury duty you'd be better off just going next door and getting a Five Guys burger... yes you will feel guilty about how bad for you it is but at least it's the good kind of bad and  and not the kind of bad taste bad you get at Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"I eat at this location fairly regularly which is too bad, really.   I like the sandwiches that Jimmy John's offers which is why I come. They are really fast, I've waited twice as long at other sandwich places but compared to the one on Scottsdale Rd, these guys are slow.   The employees aren't friendly or engaging which the other location is. There seems to be too many employees without anything else to do but stand around chatting which each other. Where is the manager on duty? It seems to be all kids who don't realize they have seem professional while at work.   There is no internet connection or phone service in the lobby. If you want to browse your phone or even send a text you have to go outside. That's a small gripe but I feel it's worth mentioning.   Other than that, the place is always clean and never busy. The sandwiches are fine and the menu has a variety of items to choose from. If you are going to go out of your way to go to Jimmy John's, go to the other one."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Who ever is the manger needs to be fired immediately . Food is great though. Very POOR people skills . O well"}
{"text":"Yeah, Jimmy really? Really? You ran out of the good bread at 1230. That is bush league.  Step your game up before places like Capriottis and potbelly take you over and you are lumped into the likes of subway and dare I say Blimpie! Oh then you have the nerve to not tell me to wait 5 min and there would be more instead of trying to whisk me through the line and get wheat. I can't believe you charge extra for that by the way. Place has gone down hill since sideburns left. I will go back and it better be fixed...or else i will probably have to find another jimmy johns somewhere else."}
{"text":"If I could give -1 stars I would. They have good subs.  But delivery is a mess at that store. I live less than a mile away and 50% of the time they come through. Not in \"freaky fast delivery\" either. I'm talking 30-45 mins after phone order. I'm completely done buying anything from this store till they can get it right. I don't mind waiting but I live a mile away. I could ride my bike there and back in less than half that time. Very sad"}
{"text":"If you would pay as much attention to your customers as you did screwing around with your coworkers, you wouldn't forget to give the customer their sandwich! Very disappointed. The Jimmy Johns in downtown Phoenix had faster service on SuperBowl weekend than this location did on a slow Tuesday! Very, very, VERY disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good Sub, Fast Friendly Service. If you order a slim you can get free mayo packets on the side.  We've always got a good sandwich.  Jimmy Johns is consistent.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING SERVICE!!! I've never actually been to this location but they have delivered to me more times than I could ever count! I never wait longer than 15 minutes, my order is always correct, and even when its 100 degrees out, the delivery guys show up with a smile. Keep up the great work you guys!"}
{"text":"First time here and hands down the experience was awesome! Clean JJ, friendly staff, quick service and bomb samiches!  Id give em 5 stars for being open till 12a and down to earth staff.  Update: One small flaw, I just got home and I come home to find out one of my sandwiches did not have what I had asked for specifically before placing my order.  I even asked my cashier and he confirmed they'll put it in the sandwich.  A Lil disappointed. For that I will still leave my 4 stars and excuse it for now.  Until next time."}
{"text":"Simple order.... A #9 cut in half, add Dijon mustard. Not cut in half, no mustard. Took 50 mins. Delightful. Second bad experience here. 3rd chance won't happen, I'm done."}
{"text":"Ok, these guys are good. They always get my order correct. Also, the last time I was there, they literally had my sandwich in my hands before I put my wallet away. Granted, I was the only person in there at the time (Saturday late afternoon) but they truly are FREAKY FAST. I just stared at the cashier and was like, \"Are you kidding me?\" I'm honestly not even worried about it. You can see everything they're doing and I order a regular ol' #9. So if they have that meat and cheese combo prepped before they lay it on my bread, what do I care? It's delicious and done correctly!   The young guys working that day were all very nice, respectful and efficient. Snaps for them!"}
{"text":"The worst JJ's I have ever been to. They refused to take any US CURRENCY over $20 however there is no sign saying so. When asked rude employee advised they are on order. I explained it the only bill I had and was told \"too bad\". I will never return to this location. RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL."}
{"text":"Great service - the delivery guys we have are fast...freaky fast.  BUT  - not sure why all of a sudden you have to pay $2.00 for a delivery charge for a sandwich and chips.  Doesn't make it worth it."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. I see why they have such poor reviews. I spoke with Alexis the night manager and she could not tell me why, but she refused to heat up my turkey meat for my sub sandwich. This is very frustrating because I'm 7 months pregnant craving a sub sandwich and I cannot have deli meat unless it's heated up first to reduce any risk of contamination /: Alexis told me that this was company policy not to ever heat up any subs, but she did not know why and refused to help me. How are you the manager and you literally don't know about your company policy. So many things not adding up. Just help a pregnant lady out one time jeez! Bye Felicia!"}
{"text":"The employee's here refused to heat up my turkey meat. I am pregnant so I rarely eat deli meats and when I do they have to be heated up to reduce any type of contamination. It was just unfortunate to be told no, even though they could heat it up, they wouldn't because then the sandwich wouldn't be \"freaky fast\" ...what the heck does it matter when there's nobody else waiting for a sandwich and you guys are all sitting around goofing off? Doesn't make a whole lot of sense. You just lost a customer."}
{"text":"Ate here at lunch today for the first time. \"eh\" is all I can say. I came in around 12:45 and even though no one was behind me in line the twerp at the counter made me feel very rushed.   I ordered a Turkey Tom. This was basically a big white dried out sandwich roll with a couple of slices of turkey, a butt-load of shredded lettuce, a couple of sliced tomatoes and some mayo (I requested no sprouts which are normally also included). What is supposed to be gourmet about that? The sprouts?    I also grabbed a chocolate chunk cookie. Not even worth eating the whole cookie. Really.   I see no reason to return and don't understand how they can call themselves gourmet..."}
{"text":"Wanted to eat a sandwich today so we checked out Jimmy John's Sandwich. The decor was interesting.. different sayings on the walls which was nice to stop and read.  As far as the sandwiches, nothing to brag about at all. Subway is a better choice, at least Subway has far better bread!! Sorry, this place gets only one star!"}
{"text":"I am thrilled a Jimmy Johns has been added to Southpointe. Fresh, simple subs, made to order. This location has only been open a week or two, and my office has already gotten delivery 3 times! I haven't eaten in yet, so I can only speak for delivery, but it's been a great experience each time. Delivery is fast & the order is always accurate. Delivery person has been very polite. We will continue to order subs for delivery. If you work in southpointe and haven't had Jimmy Johns yet, give it a try!"}
{"text":"I give two stars because the employees were nice. I got the Turkey Tom. I'd rather have gone to port of subs. This sandwich was not good. $8 and change for a bland sandwich that had one slice of turkey and provolone with a medium drink?! I asked for mustard, not Dijon, but got Dijon. Wiping off the Dijon is why I know there was one slice of turkey, and tons of lettuce! I could have had a better meal for $1 more at Port of Subs, with more meat and vegetables on my sandwich, drink, chips, and without charging an extra dollar for cheese. Do Not Recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy their Italian subs! Jimmy John's has pretty good prices, although their sandwiches could be bigger.  They run a quick service sandwich shop, which is fun to eat at because the store is decorated with humorous signs and things of that nature. This is another sandwich shop that doesn't have very good desserts though in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is a very convenient place for a jimmy johns. There's all these fancy or sit down places around here but if I just want a sandwich then this i where I go. They are super fast and follow good direction as I altered my sandwich a lot. Overall good experience besides parking."}
{"text":"First time visiting \"Jimmy Johns\".  I get it .. fresh subs - fast.  It's similar to all the other sandwich places but less flair (toppings).  After reviewing the menu I chose the BLT.   It was fresh no doubt but very forgettable and meh.  Honestly, I wished I would have waited until I got home and just made a grilled cheese sandwich.   This is a popular sandwich shop.. a few customers (males) came in while I was sitting there eating.  I did enjoy my reduced fat thinny chips.  The place was super clean and the customer service was on point.   $9.00 for BLT, chips and drink - average."}
{"text":"59 minute delivery! I thought this place was supposed to be freaky fast... I ordered a sandwich online at 1:01pm and it did not arrive until 2:00pm. Called 40 minutes in and the girl said they are always understaffed and overwhelmed. I don't even really like JJ's but I needed delivery on a busy day at work. NEVER AGAIN. Oh and the cucumbers were missing on my sandwich too.  Fail."}
{"text":"So, I'd previously written about JJ's absurd reply that at 2.1 miles from one their franchises it was too far to deliver.  I've recently seen JJ delivery vehicles within a few streets from my house so I thought they may have realized the stupidity of their policy and now delivered.  Tried an online order and was again told they do not deliver to my area. What? So I contacted corporate and got the same ridiculous reply. Now remember this, Yelpers, I live 2.1 miles away. The driver doesn't need a passport to get here.  Does not have to book overnight lodging.  Needs not cross the Himalayas. A round trip would take all of ten minutes.  So if it's such a short trip, why don't I just go myself? It's the principle. Don't brag about \"freaky fast\" delivery and then not deliver.  Okay, I promise no more tirades against JJ."}
{"text":"Politically, JJs is absolutely the worst. But the subs, OH the subs. That said, for some reason, this is the worst Jimmy Johns in CU. Not sure why, but it's never as satisfying as other ones. I highly recommend the one on Lincoln, though."}
{"text":"This store has absolute worst service. I ordered from there and 50 minutes later, there was nothing. I called and they told me they were a man down so they are running late. This is something, I understand however he followed that up with, \"well I don't know how long it will be, could be an hour or more, I can cancel it if you want\". I've personally worked at a Jimmy John's before and this is not normal, in no circumstance should it take 2 hours to deliver sandwiches at 3 pm. And it definitely should not be followed by such a \"no shits given attitude\". Worst possible service that I could possible expect from JJ"}
{"text":"Just wow. Not like any JJ's I've been too. They fought over who would take my order. No one wanted to. After finally someone stepped up instead of a happy greeting I got not a word and after taking my order I was told the total and given my card back with a thank you or a smile. It just seemed like they were more disappoint to get a customer even though they weren't busy at all. With two order my sandwiches weren't freaky fast actually freaky slow. And the presentation was horrible. There was more outside of the sandwich than inside. With a subway right next door you would think they would be better."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's makes pretty good sandwiches I like the number two.  one little problem with them too much ice  in there drinks  .three good swallows of soda all you have is a cup full of ice"}
{"text":"Great service. If there is one thing about me and food I get at a restaurant. I love to have great service. Jimmy John's serve me up at Turkey Tom and it was the most amazing sandwich and experience. Three gentleman making it happen for fresh out the gym. Hungry and exhausted they gave me just what I needed.  Clean bathrooms! I love that part."}
{"text":"I just started a new job and stumbled upon this JJs location less than 5 minutes from my office so I stopped here for lunch today.   I get an hour for lunch and since I'm always paranoid about being late anywhere I decided JJs \"freaky fast\" subs would be the way to go. They seriously stick to their motto don't they? Between the time I ordered to the time I finished filling up my water cup, my sub was already waiting for me.   Honesty, I was impressed. Being in an incredibly business (office) heavy location, I know they probably get slammed for lunch... and today was no different. There's a large selection of tables inside and every one of them was filled... yet every sandwich seemed to come out \"freaky fast\" anyway.  I'm knocking one star for the presentation of my sandwich. Coming to this type of establishment, I know I can't expect much in terms of look, however, I had to shove the majority of my sandwich insides back in as I was eating since they were practically out of the bread to begin with. Still timely and delicious none the less."}
{"text":"These guys are life savers. I'm Anthrocon staff, and I'm stuck up in the DLCC all day. While the food is pretty much exactly what I'd expect from a Jimmy John's, the delivery impresses the hell out of me. 10 minutes to get food delivered directly to the exact meeting room I'm trapped in, extremely reliably. Great work folks."}
{"text":"Solid sandwiches, solid staff. Great place to grab a quick bite on a work break, or get a nearby delivery fast! The ingredients are always fresh and the meats are always great! My personal favorite is a #16 with Dijon mustard! Can't really go wrong at Jimmy Johns for a tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns but it seems they are skimping on ingredients. The tomatoes look sad and I could've used a little more meat. I asked for onions and have like 3 or 4 on here. My bread isn't fresh either. Maybe it was a bad lunch time."}
{"text":"I always order from jimmy Johns, easy quick and reasonably healthy. Today my sandwich was hard as a rock, I could probably hammer a nail into wood with the bread. Gave half to my dog and tossed the other half out. Called and asked for a remade sandwich. #1, manager wanted the original sandwich back? I told her half was in my dogs belly and half was in the trash. #2Guy brought me a new sandwich, still asked for the first sandwich, as if I would go through this trouble and be deceitful over a sandwich? #3 new sandwich was just as terrible as the first. Yes Jimmy Johns. I threw it out. No I won't bother asking for another one. Keep my money.  Never ordering from this Jimmy Johns again."}
{"text":"Really can't go wrong with JJ's. I mean it's a good sandwich, they're open late and they deliver. I almost always get the gargantuan (an incredible amount of meat on one sand which) and am never disappointed. Oddly enough I like that they have sandwiches that are prebuilt on the menu, as opposed to subway, since it makes ordering for a group so much easier. Good for a fast and casual or late night bite."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's. In fact, it's my favorite hangover food: you can eat a whole sub without feeling disgusting and take a nap with all of that bread settling into your abused stomach. Perfection.  But, this location is not my hangover location, it's my \"I'm starving and need a quick lunch because my desk isn't going to clear itself off while I get a luxurious one-hour lunch break.\" This location, like all others, can satisfy my need for carbs and some protein or loads of veggies, plus a pickle and chips if I'm feeling the need for more salt in my lunch. It's a quick walk from the office, so I get some fresh air, a tasty lunch and back to the grind before I waste my afternoon away.   The only problem I found when I came here was the service. The girl that took my order was completely zoned out. Granted, it was during a lunch rush and I can understand that those are not the most fun for some people (I loved lunch rushes when I was in customer service...made the time go by quicker and moved people along faster), but that's even more reason to be on your toes and attentive. She just kind of stared at me with that blank stoner stare, like I was a sandwich or something."}
{"text":"I don't have much to say, since this is a pretty solid sub place. While it's better than Subway, it's not as good as Dave's. Since I live near Coventry and I have a choice between all three of them, it's clear where I would rather go.  Anyways, Jimmy's: 1. They're fast. 2. The Beach Club never fails. 3. Sprouts. 4. Pickles."}
{"text":"Screw this place hard. I ordered a turkey sandwich with double turkey and got one THIN layer of turkey. ONE. THIN. LAYER. In essence I paid $7 for a small loaf of hard french bread. Now I'm starving after eating it and I'm out $7 I could've spent ANYWHERE else and gotten more value. This is not a sandwich place; its a bread store."}
{"text":"The staff here should ALL BE FIRED! They acted like they were inconvenienced by my presence as a customer. I've NEVER, EVER felt so poorly treated in my life! This location needs to be shut down....I'd hate for someone to judge the whole chain based on this horrible store!"}
{"text":"I love Jimmie John's!!! Every time I walk in the door I am greeted with smiling, friendly faces. The service is always fast- never sloppy. I am not a huge bread fan, so I come here for the unwhich (no bread). My Fiancé loves the Italian nightclub (with bread). If you are a sandwich lover I suggest you Run, don't walk to Jimmie Johns :-)"}
{"text":"I love jimmy johns, It's a great place. But this jimmy johns cannot get their communication skills down. I have ordered here for delivery when they first opened and they told me they don't deliver out to the homes next to target on ocotillo and Arizona Ave. so I accepted it and moved on with my life. Only to one day find a jimmy johns car in my neighborhood, so I asked what jimmy johns the guy was from and he said this one. So I called and asked for delivery and they delivered no problem. I thought that was weird but maybe because they were new at the time they were still trying to get the hang of it. Well I just tried to order from them today and I had the manager tell me they don't deliver to me and that they don't have record delivering to me before in the past. Their communication skills are terrible between the managers and drivers."}
{"text":"Take the girl who apparently doesn't listen because she is too busy screwing around with the guy next to her on the headset off the drive thru. 625 pm."}
{"text":"Oh jimmy johns...how I love thee. Let me count the ways..."}
{"text":"Food here is always tasty and prepared quickly. Staff is usually helpful and knowledgeable however today that was not the case! I ordered an unwich combo and was offered a pickle which I accepted. When I questioned the total the young woman behind the register just stared at me when it was obvious I was looking for an explanation. Pickle slices have been complimentary so I was surprised when I was asked to pay for a whole pickle.  I didn't really want a whole pickle but again no explanation was offered.  Cashier just stared RUDELY.   BADLY DONE JIMMY JOHNS"}
{"text":"Mmmm mmmm good sandwiches. Hubs introduced me & just like him I love the hot peppers. The RB was good the Italian Night Club is the best. I haven't ventured past the Italian Night Club since I tried it. The bread is fresh & delicious & if you like pickles & I do order one! If you do you'll thank me for telling you to. They are the whole, fresh & the perfect crispy tangy alternative to the chip. Shout out to the hubs for taking me to the best sandwiches on the West Side. Blows that Subway away down the street 91st Ave & Lower Buckeye that runs out of oh every freaking thing all of the time. Hate that place! My only wish is that they delivered all the way to my house.  1 hint I do offer is bring a partner in crime & share. These 8 in. subs are NOT high on fluff aka lettuce & vegi's so you get full quick."}
{"text":"Every time I go here I leave disappointed. This location in particular has made it so I won't be visiting jimmy johns ever again. The bread tasted days old, there was almost no avocado on my sandwich which I paid extra for, and the tomatoes had gone bad. Worst sandwich ever. I took it to go, otherwise I would have asked for my money back."}
{"text":"Called in to make an order for delivery, dude who answered the phone: \"hey whatsup?\"  Not mad just, this isn't cheeba hut. The convo goes as follows:  Me: \"what's on your Italian sub?\" Dude man bro: \"Uh like, salami, ham, capicola, some veggies and mayo.\" Me: \"can I add jalapeno and olives to that?\" Dude man bro: \"we don't have that, I'm sorry bro but there's nothing I can do about that.\" Me: \"S'all good man, no worries.\" Turns out this dude is the one delivering to me and I'm writing this review as I wait, I'm pretty stoked to see this stoner in person, cuz my phone experience was nothing short of baffling. If I wasn't so wasted right now i'd prbly give him some hints on professionalism, but fuck it, I'm just hungry."}
{"text":"suck suck suck...freaky fast my ass. Ordered online because they are usually quick. 45min past and I had to cancel my order and request a refund."}
{"text":"Here with the fam.  Rude staff, cashier and sandwich makers are rude.  Simple requests like salt and pepper please get nasty responses back.  By the way, they don't have salt and pepper??  Anyhow, not good for the family.  Dreading asking for a bag to leave."}
{"text":"I have had Jimmy John's before, but this was the first time in Surprise. Bread wasn't as fresh as I remembered, and both the sweetend and unsweetened teas were empty. I mentioned it but after waiting for our sandwiches and eating them, no effort was made to make more tea (not busy at the time, and two people working). Place was clean, but flies were buzzing around as we ate, and the music was too loud to suit me. I will probably give them another chance though, as Jimmy John's has the best Roast Beef sandwiches I have found in a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"This was the first time we had Jimmy Johns.  And we used the delivery service.  I had the BLT and man was it good.  My husband had a roast beef and Mom had ham and cheese.  And the delivery was super fast.  We defiantly will eat here again!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Jimmy Johns before, and as an airline pilot, I try out different locations all over the country. Today, I had the worst customer service experience over something stupid. Because I travel for work, I like to order a sandwich and take it with me in my cooler, so I ask them to wrap it in Saran Wrap so it holds better. It's NEVER been a problem until today when this employee(I didn't catch her name but she had a million zits on her face) told me she wasn't sure if she could do it and had to call her manager. After a minute on the phone she says they can do it this once but can't guarantee they'll do it in the future. Then my sandwich gets made and this little brat throws it on the counter at me and walks away without a word. Just an attitude. Well Jimmy Johns, I can't guarantee I'll ever be a customer again. To be clear, the other employees there were friendly but this girl has no customer service skills...."}
{"text":"Very fast, like 70 percent of the time... However highly unorganized. Placed an online order and it took 15 mins to pick it up. Somewhat ridiculous."}
{"text":"Seriously best sandwiches I've tasted!! Plus great customer service friendly guys, take your order fast and have your sandwiches ready in no time. I got the number 9 \"Italian Nightclub\" i highly recommend that one and ask for cherry peppers for the little extra kick. They also deliver ,check it out if your in the mood for a good sub(:"}
{"text":"The person who originally took my order, Austin, was great but this location I CONSTANTLY have problems with. They take forever and apparently now they're lying to customers. I've been sitting in my house for over an hour waiting on my order. When I called into the store to check on it the guy immediately went on the defensive saying \"Ya my driver went out knocked on the door waited for several minutes and called several times\" I told him this was untrue and that I got one phone call upon picking up the phone the person immediately hung up. He went on to explain his driver was there for over a year and he wouldn't lie when I offered to come in there and show him my call log he yelled out for the driver and said hey this lady said you didn't go there at all and was like well it'll be 20 minutes no matter what. I asked if I could just come pick it up and him refund the delivery charge he said he would have to completely void out the order and REMAKE it. I just said fine I'll wait the 20 minutes but let's see if it actually shows up. I haven't ordered from Jimmy John's in months bc of their poor customer service and after tonight I probably won't be ordering from this location again. I'd rather spend 20 dollars elsewhere."}
{"text":"Subs So fast you'll freak. Sandwich done before you put your change in your pocket."}
{"text":"What can you say about jimmy johns. It located close by olds town and next to hotel valley ho. This place can really hit the spot when your hungry. You order pay and the sandwich is ready real quick. Plus the quality of them is really good keeps you full. Price isn't bad for them either. Much better then subway or Togo. Wish they had this in Cali. Would go here over Ike's or which wich. The only bad thing is service can suck on some nights but I think they get annoyed with drunk people coming in all the time while they have to work and deal with all there crap. Overall I would come back here when back in town"}
{"text":"I've had Jimmy John's sandwiches before, but mostly when work bought them and brought them in.  So I decided to try this one tonight.  After they explained what U/F/W meant, since I'd never been to a JJ's before.  I picked the Totally Tuna and within 1 minute, my sandwich was made.  Talk about FAST!  This was ULTRA insane FAST!  Did I mention they made the sandwich exactly the way I wanted it?  And it tasted AWESOME!  I think I found a new option for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for going above and beyond to find me !!!  I am located in a business center with lots of suites,  and you bend over backwards calling me and doing everything in your power to get my food to me!!! You are appreciated!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say? It's fresh, it's delicious and it's cheap. I love the convenience of being able to order in-home delivery too. They're also very quick. I usually get the #8, Italian sub. It's pretty gigantic, (you can save half for a second lunch later)."}
{"text":"Love the decorum and funny sayings on the walls!  If you are looking for mega amounts of meat then this is the place for you.  Not a whole lot of freedom of choice on how you want things.  Not real helpful staff since we were first timers and had questions.  The menu does help out quite a bit.  Probably my third choice in the line of chains to choose from."}
{"text":"I frequent this jimmy johns often. The store is always spotless, cashiers are helpful and polite and my sandwich is always spot on, sometimes its even out before I'm finished paying! I always get the Itailian night Club with extra sauce and hot peppers."}
{"text":"I order from here when I need a fast lunch!! All the drivers are extremely nice especially Amanda she is a sweetheart!! They almost always deliver before the estimated time during lunch rush! Phenomenal work guys! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I do love you Jimmy John's, but when you tell me that I have to pay for a water glass after 10pm to go with my sandwich that is a joke.  The cashier laughed as asked for a water glass and he said it would be $1.50.  Are you serious?  There are other more worthy late night places than this location."}
{"text":"I have visited this location about a dozen times now since they opened. Their sandwiches are good. I especially love their freshly-baked bread. Always plenty of staff behind the counter so service is super fast, a feature that keeps me coming back over Subway or other shops. There are times they are nearly done making my sandwich by the time I'm done paying for it. Service is usually friendly. Location is weird and slightly inconvenient to find."}
{"text":"I usually come here because this place is close to my house. This review is for a specific employee. I believe his name was Bryce. He was very professional and respectful. This guy deserves some sort of recognition for being probably the best employee I have seen here. There was another worker in the back, some blonde woman. She did not smile but yet kept eyeballing me. Regardless, this review is for Mr Bryce. Good job sir."}
{"text":"I work nearby and have picked up lunch from here fairly often over the last few years. I've never had a problem with any sandwich that I've ordered. The bread is great and fresh, and they've always been really generous with ingredients. They're also super fast in making sandwiches. I walk from work so don't have to deal with parking which I know isn't ideal."}
{"text":"Ate here about an hour ago and it wasn't that good.  I ordered the veggie add sprouts, Dijon mustard and oil and vinegar.  States on receipt those three items.  They added sprouts and that was it.  The sandwich itself was very bland and boring.  No flavor just eh.   There were 15 people behind the counter so with 15 people you would think my order would of been right.  Looked very chaotic behind the counter. Not very impressed.  I would of rather ate at port of subs!"}
{"text":"I love this location! Especially the delivery! They're always  super quick and my order is never wrong! Never had one bad sandwich from there! Keep up the good work JJs!"}
{"text":"Heard great things about Jimmy Johns, so we stopped by and tried their subs last night. I wasn't impressed. Not much in the roll, which wasn't real fresh, except lettuce. If they had squirted more of the dressing on the roll, it might have been better. As it was, I had to  check and see if they put anything on it at all. I think Firehouse does a better job."}
{"text":"I'm mainly writting this review because how impressed I was by today's experience, even though I've ordered here previously. 1) super quick taking my order over the phone and good customer service. Ordered 11:27am.  2) delivered by 11:37am. From a sweet young man on his BICYCLE!!! SOOOOO IMPRESSED.  3) sandwich fresh and exactly how i ordered.  that made my day. Ty ty ty."}
{"text":"After visiting this location multiple times, the staff has now remembered our names, and general order preferences. I find this to be a truly amazing feat, due to the sheer volume a business of this type see's per day."}
{"text":"Wow when they say they make their sandwich fresh, from house made baked bread to freshly slice deli, cheese, and toppings, it's a win-win. I went for The Veggie ($5.69) which has layers of provolone cheese, real avocado spread, sliced cucumber, shredded lettuce, sliced tomato, mayo, and I requested to add hot peppers. The hot peppers definitely gives The Veggie sandwich a nice spicy kick. And I like the texture of their bread, it makes the sandwich very satisfying. You can purchase a day old bread for 50 cents and it is a great bargain deal.  If you want a tasty dessert, they have cookies sourced from a local vendor in Las Vegas. They have Raisin Oatmeal ($1.75) and Triple Chocolate Chunk ($1.75). I was told to heat in the microwave because it taste better when the cookie is warm. Both cookies taste good. But if I were to choose between the two cookies, I would go for the Triple Chocolate Chunk simply because it's made with good quality Ghirardelli Chocolate Chips.  The service is fast and I like how the ingredients are fresh. It wasn't busy when I came so I had a chance to learn a little history about Jimmy John's. The owner began work at a hot dog stand, and later on he ventured toward building a small business making a simple gourmet sandwich and delivering it fresh. What's impressive is that Jimmy John is always smiling, I was able to see a jolly and cheerful photo of him. This place is a very chill and relaxing environment with good music in the background. They have a large sandwich menu board and I love the positive quotes that are featured on the wall. Also if you're looking for additional seating, they do have a second floor where you can enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Jimmy johns location. I love the slim #5 and how I can save $1 but not putting lettuce etc on the sandwich....since I didn't want them on there anyway."}
{"text":"I like how they have the \"skinny\" option where it costs less to get a sandwich without the lettuce mayo etc I never get those anyway and its nice to save a $1."}
{"text":"There were sharpies hanging out in their meat. Yes, they saw it sitting there but never took it out..."}
{"text":"Will never go back to Subway. Good, flaky baguette, fresh ingredients, love the peppers and their own chips (perfectly thick, crisp, and seasoned)."}
{"text":"I Always enjoy the food at this location.  I usually get the Ultimate Porker and it's always very tasty!  They make the food fast and I'm in and out in a matter of minutes.  Convenient to my house and work, so I'll keep coming back for more!  I visited this location again yesterday (06/28/2017) and everything was perfect. Bread was fresh and the jalapeno chips have lots of zing."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times and I have always had friendly service and of course they are really fast at making the sandwiches. Sandwiches have been consistent and are great tasting."}
{"text":"For what it is, Jimmy Johns is great.  They make decent subs at a decent price, fast.  They move along nicely, they handle lunchtime traffic very well.  The sub that I like is the Vito.  I usually get that with their Salt & Vinegar Jimmy Chips which are very tasty.  Overall,  I still think DiBellas and Jersey Mikes make better subs overall but Jimmy Johns is a close contender and very worth visiting."}
{"text":"It's a Jimmy John's,  not much in customizing your sub,  but if you like it the style they serve it,  then it's good.  I'm cool with Italian bread,  turkey,  cheese, mayo,  lettuce,  and tomatoes. I won't rate it against a gourmet sub place because it's not.  It is a quality sub,  quick and fairly inexpensive."}
{"text":"This location is right near my office, which makes it great for grabbing a quick lunch or even a couple sandwiches to bring home for dinner.  It's not fine dining and I know some people would think \"it's a sandwich shop, does it really deserve 5 stars?\"  Well for me, yes, because even though I wouldn't go here everyday, when I do go, I do enjoy it.  There are a couple of employees here that I always enjoy talking to, and I believe one is even the manager.  We joke around about my favorite football team, which he is not a fan of.  But we can banter back and forth with no hard feelings, always in fun and we're both smiling when I leave.  This location gets extremely busy at lunchtime and I know that they work hard to get the orders right, and if they don't, they will do what they can to fix it.  To me that is the sign of a successful business - good people working hard and doing all they can to make the customers happy."}
{"text":"So, the food is good, but the manager who seems to constantly be drunk and a illiterate loser, proceeds to throw turkey meet at this young girl who works with him. Very rude and unprofessional . Not only that,  he made comments on her breasts. Really, if I was. Her I slap a major law suite. On the owner. I will never go back there agian."}
{"text":"Stopped in today after church, clean, upbeat environment.   First time here, so we asked about their most popular sandwiches.  Definitely gave a great recommendation - I went with the #9 Italian Night Club w/ hot peppers.  Good amount of meat, and other condiments.  Peppers gave it a nice little kick, even picked up a bag of their Jalapeno Potato Chips.  My only complaint is I wish the sandwich was a little bigger, it was gone, but I wanted to keep eating because it was so good.     Fed a family of 4 for about $20, which isn't too bad.   Music was playing, but I didn't think it was too loud.  Sandwiches were finished about the same time we paid, so not a lot of waiting required.  Sorry Mr. Goodcents, but I may have just found a new sub shop."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in while attending the Cruz on Central. We were disappointed with the outcome. The bread was bland, the sandwich could have been made better.  The restroom was a horrid mess and filthy. There were no napkins nor salt n pepper on the tables.  We will consider Subway or Miracle Mile next time...  Carol D'Andrea-Teague.."}
{"text":"Pretty much the most 'blah' sandwich I've ever had. this place makes subway look like gourmet. I ordered a veggie, was not given a choice of bread just a plain white roll was used. when asked what my cheese options were \"Provolone and provolone\" Uh, okay. And I don't like mayo but love yellow mustard. \"we only have Dijon\" .........  my sandwich is literally white roll, Provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado, Dijon mustard and... yeah that's it. $7 for a meal I could be digging a footlong at subway right now with 5 different cheese varieties.   Pass."}
{"text":"Don't bother!  You can make every single sandwich in the comfort of your own home and I bet you it'll taste even better than those of Jimmy Johns.  There's no significance in their sandwiches at all.  Prior to my visit the other day, I've only had Jimmy Johns at work during lunch meetings or something like that.  Whenever my company would order Jimmy Johns for lunch, I thought the sandwiches must be like this because we ordered such a big order.  \"Like this\" means, they were always so small, scarce, little condiments, very little meat, dry, hard bread.   After my visit the other day I realized NO, Jimmy John's sandwiches are \"like this\" all the time.  It's just them! So no ... I won't be eating Jimmy John's again.    I stopped in during lunch time, around 12 on the dot.  There was only 1 other person in the restaurant eating.  Weird!  It's Old Town Scottsdale, during lunch time and the restaurant only had 1 patron in there.  I ordered the Vito.  The cashier told me my total (almost 7 bucks), and said just a few minutes.  I walked to the area where you pick up your sandwich and I asked the guy making the sandwiches if I'm supposed to tell him what I'd like on it.  He said, \"No, you tell the cashier\".  The cashier didn't ask me and I had no idea.  So I walk back to the cashier and tell him what I'd like on my sandwich.  Cool!  Less than 3 minutes later, my sandwich is ready.  The sandwich was made like rapidly fast! They call my number and I walk up to pick it up.  No napkins, no bag, nothing, just my sandwich.  By the time I sat down about 4 more people came in.  I feel like they only came to Jimmy Johns because everywhere else was crowded.  I won't return!"}
{"text":"Ordered a party tray of a variety of subs from here for a christmas eve gathering... the bread was hard, very dry.. not fresh at all. very disappointed, they hardly got eaten. Also, too much shredded lettuce and not enough meat/cheese on these. very thin."}
{"text":"Yes, they are fast and yes they do deliver which is especially nice on rainy and snowy days.  The delivery people are always nice but the food is lacking.  The last couple of times I have ordered from here there is barely anything on the sandwich.  The last one was more bread than anything else.  I don't know if they are cutting back or if it the people making the sandwich but it certainly isn't worth the money anymore!!  Where's the Meat?? And lettuce and tomato???  If I wanted just bread I would have ordered just bread!  Geez!  I feel ripped off"}
{"text":"This Jimmy Johns sucks balls. Music is always too loud to get your order in. The employees look like they are dazed and confused. The sandwiches aren't all that great. Seems like they have cut back on the meat than previous visits.  They never rotate the chips under the front counter. Always put new chips in front of the chips that are already there.  I've had a couple of their employees be rude before.  Don't waste your time here, go to Subway in the building next door.  I'd give it no stars if it was an option."}
{"text":"I have given this place a few chances but won't be ordering again. The last time I ordered the girl picked up the phone and answered by saying \"Yo\". Then it took 45minutes to get my order and I live a half mile away and to top it off it was the wrong order. The subs are so bland it's not even funny! I called to let them know I got the wrong order and the same girl asked me if I could bring it in! Will not order from here again and I will take my business some where else."}
{"text":"Old favorite in Michigan was so happy to find one near my work!  I'd give it a 4 but was stood off by service.  It wasn't bad but it was rushed!  My questions were looked at oddly and they weren't, I just asked about a different meat combo.  Now they did do it and it was good.  Love the bread, very fresh.  Its a brand new location i think so the service may improve."}
{"text":"I think the best kept secret of Jimmy John's is the wheat bread. I'm consistenly a Bootlegger Club (high protein, no cheese) and a pickle. I love a good dill pickle!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches as usual, but the service at this location is not into the details like the other locations I have visited.  As an example, when my sandwiches were ready, (which is ultra-fast) the gal put them up on the counter, here you go...  I asked for a bag, and she points to the counter below and on the other side of the ledge, and says (while touching them) they are right there....  OK, really?  Just details, but you couldn't hand me one?  So, I reach over the ledge and down and get my own bag.  Maybe they should put the bags ON the ledge to clearly display it is self-service. But again, I like the sandwiches.  Cucumber, lettuce, tomato all very good on my Tuna on wheat.  My husband really enjoyed his Club, he wishes they had bacon, but since I like the tuna so much, he deals with the no bacon issue with few complaints!"}
{"text":"Third time screw up and they are out! For some reason this location can't seem to get it right. Turkey sandwich, no mayo. Sounds simple, but every time I've ordered I either get no lettuce or no tomatoes. The last time it happened, I called and spoke to the manager who didn't care, all he said was \"oops.\" Never again!"}
{"text":"I had Jimmy John's a few months back at another location and it wasn't so great.  One just opened up here in Laveen so I thought I'd give them another chance.  Maaaaannn...  Maybe that location wasn't so good but this one is amazing. This time I ordered online. I got an Italian night club with salt and vinegar Jimmy chips and a pickle. That sandwich was bomb!  That Genoa salami, that capicola and ham with the Italian vinaigrette... delicious. The menu recommends the hot cherry peppers on it, so you know I had to have em.  Nice and spicy.  Great chips, really good pickle.  When they say \"freaky fast\" they ain't playin.  Dude was at the door in ten minutes!  Totally wasn't expecting that.   Good stuff, seriously. Can't wait to try out some other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Actually, it's no stars. I called JJ's tonight to find out they do not deliver to my home which is just a mile down 7th street from them. So, you have to be somewhere above Coral Gables Dr and below Union Hills for them to deliver! I was going to order two club subs just to sample. Oh, well, I'll call Isa's or Charr instead! They have great food and deliver to my house!"}
{"text":"Dude,   The slowest service ever.  I placed my order on the app.  I finally had to call and find out where my order was.   Not to mention that this location is 1 mile from me"}
{"text":"Walk in today at 3:35 PM and nobody at register. I hear guys in back talking and one drops the f-bomb. Then I hear is 6-8 time sin a row for no reason what so ever. Then a guy comes out and I looked at him and just left. Real classy workers. So why would I want to spend my money there?? Real low class and probably will never go there or any other Jimmy John again. Grow up and act like a mature person with a job."}
{"text":"this location has some of the worst customer service i've ever experienced at a food place as a whole. as the woman on the drawer closest to the drive thru window was incompetent and did not comply when simply asked for a pickle. she responded that it was a side and sandwich didn't come with the pickle and was told okay, as in, charge me for it; so when sandwiches arrive we expect pickles and they're not there. then the sandwich maker proceeds to tell us they're a side, they're not on our ticket, and he is not giving me the pickle. as it is ONE pickle which i thought i was charged for, giving it to the person is what you should properly do. hope someone talks to your workers about attitude towards customers and teaches them how to take CARE of your customers and not just have them be a \"number\" who walks in."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is to die for! I will never return to Subway after discovering this sandwich shop. I'm not even a Vegetarian but their #6 Veggie Sandwich is all I crave when I think about sandwiches. This is a great location with a convenient drive thru, I've never had a problem with the customer service. Yeah some employees don't seem to be happy to be working but everyone has a bad day or two especially in the fast food industry. Thanks Jimmy John's for being delicious and way better than subway!"}
{"text":"I live fairly close to this location. I ordered 4 sandwiches tonight for delivery which took almost 45 minutes. So much for freaky fast. My order totaled $28 which included a $4.00 \"trip charge\" and I also added an extra $4 tip. So I was disappointed at the wait and then one of the sandwiches was missing extra toppings that were ordered. I called and spoke with a manager who had someone bring me a new sandwich. They insisted that I had to hand over the incorrect sandwich in order to get the new one! I handed them the 1/2 that was left!!! Sorry! You were slow on delivery to begin with but handing you back the sandwich you delivered was the last straw. It's probably laying somewhere down the street. I find this to be terrible customer service."}
{"text":"The food is simple and fresh but don't receive a wrong order. We ordered a fair amount of sandwiches for our office today and had horrible customer service. Each sandwich had something small added which was marked as a NO on the online ordering system. No big deal we can pick off... However, when we called to have a sandwich remade due to the person wanting complete plain and the fact  jimmy johns added the works to it, the manager was nothing but nasty. He preceeded to say he would remake the sandwich but we should know it is our fault ( excuse me?? ). Due to the manager's horrible ability to please a customer he has now lost this company's business.... Bottom line: you better eat what comes because if it's wrong you are an idiot and to blame.  Needless to say we declined his hateful offer to make a new one .... Spit isn't what I ordered."}
{"text":"I have been going here on and off for convenience for lunch for about a year. The only reason I go back is for the fact that they are fast. Otherwise the customer service is reallllllyy bad. There are bunch of kids in there with clearly very little management guiding them. They are rude, messing around behind the counter, sitting on the counter where they put the food, never say sorry for messing up your order. They suck. I have sworn them off many times before but I keep going back because I'm in a rush for lunch. If you have the time go to subway across the street."}
{"text":"Cheap  Quick  Decent  I am a fan of Jimmy John's"}
{"text":"Very impressed.  First time here and was yummy.  Oh, and super fast!  Service and staff were friendly also."}
{"text":"Poor quality  sandwich  for the price. No meat on them  delivery was fast and friendly"}
{"text":"One of the worst locations. Haven't been in awhile so I went back and now I remember why. Staff is always rude and rushing you to order. If the sandwiches were good I would absolutely be able to overlook the miserable guy taking my order but they just aren't. Last time I ordered a simple turkey sandwich with a few add ons, they forgot the hot peppers--the pinnacle of my sandwich! The produce is bland and the bread was just, blah. Gross. Would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"I would most definitely not go out of my way to go to this place. The guy at the front counter looks at you like your a moron. Sandwiches just aren't good. I can promise that even I were to get a free gift from someone to go here I wouldn't"}
{"text":"The best subs ever! They need to put a store in Anthem, Az.  We travel 20 miles one way to get their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's has quality sandwiches. I'm not much of a sandwich person, but when it comes to Jimmy John's I'll go there anytime.   My favorite is the veggie (#6) unwich with sprouts added. When you get an \"unwich\" they wrap the sandwich with lettuce instead of bread. It sounds like a salad you can hold but my god is it delicious!!  This particular location has the Jimmy John's quality of food, without any of the enthusiasm. I almost feel like I'm bothering the employees when I come in for food. They are fast, just not friendly, not interested, no questions asked.  One time I had came 5 minutes past open and the door was locked. I waited for a couple minutes thinking they didn't realize it was time. The employees looked at me. I looked at them. They kept staring.. So I left. I didn't have the time, patience, or energy to convince them it was past open time and I'm a paying customer.  All in all if you want a sandwich it's delicious, all other aspects are \"eh\".   Parking can be really tight. There aren't many spots and they share a lot with Starbucks on a very busy intersection. If there is no parking you may want to park at Panera instead and walk over."}
{"text":"Never heard of a place that won't deliver when you only live 3 miles away. Lost my business!!!"}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes for sandwiches which i don't mind doing, except the entire time two female employees were arguing about how to make the sandwich as they had a line of people wanting to order themselves. Also, not wearing gloves while dealing with money then immediately making sandwiches is quite disgusting."}
{"text":"if you are serious about eating a sandwich, you go to a real deli. just like if you're serious about eating mexican food, you don't hit up taco bell. as far as chain sandwich places goes, i think it ranks high. but it is still not anything special by any means."}
{"text":"A small store near the movie theaters at this mall.  There was a limited selection of sandwiches on the menu board, but you could make additions to each sandwich.   I believe they had a couple sizes of bread lengths, but the most cod effective is to order the 16\" and split it with someone.   The turkey sandwich I ordered was okay with the lettuce, mayo, etc.    I prefer the other national chain sub to this one.    The service was okay, and it took just as long as the other national sub chain."}
{"text":"Ordered The Veggie without tomato.  This was my first visit to Jimmy John's.  It was the weakest sandwich I've ever eaten.  Only had shredded lettuce, a few slices of cucumber and 2 slices of paper thin white cheese.  It was supposed to have avocado spread on it, which it did not!  If I hadn't ordered it to go, I would have demanded my money back.  Do yourself a favor -- go to Subway."}
{"text":"This Jimmy John's is pretty typical of the others -- fast, fresh production of gourmet-style sandwiches. It meets the high standard, that's for sure, and it's a good location uptown to cater to the busy business lunch crowd.  Just a couple of things to keep in mind before you go there:  *Parking can be tough, unless you're fortunate to find a meter nearby on either 3rd Street or Tryon. It can be near impossible when there's an event going on. Hopefully, you're already uptown and can walk there easily.  *There's no dining area there. That's not a problem if the weather is OK, because you can simply find a spot to sit outside across the street at the Wachovia outdoor plaza.  *It closes pretty darn early, at 7 p.m. Unlike some similar fast-food eateries in the area, such as the Pita Pit, it's not open late. They kind of concede to the fancier dine-in restaurants on the block.  *The delivery area is pretty limited. They won't go anywhere across I-277 to bike over your sandwiches. The best bet for quick service is to order ahead, either online or on the phone."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I called and spoke with the manager on duty and he didn't seem to care much. I bet if we were catering a holiday party for our 400 person office he would care more. Still reaching out to corporate.  I work in an office building in Spring Valley and called to place an order for my coworkers and I to have lunch. They said that because they cannot find us on Google maps they wouldn't be able to deliver to us. We are a new building on a new street and do not show up on Google. After I gave the guy directions on how to get to where we are located and telling me we are located outside of the cutoff delivery area(we are NOT) he gave up and apologized after I told him that I would order from somewhere who would be more accommodating. I forwarded the information throughout the company so that everyone knows not to order from this location because they are lazy and unhelpful. I will be reaching out to the corporate office as well because this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"I placed an online order for two sandwiches which seems like a small feat for a sandwich shop. Once I got home, I saw the my husband's had mayo on it and he hates mayo. I called to let them know our order was incorrect and was told to bring it back for a replacement. Once I got there, the \"manager\" was so confused as to how to make the sandwich without mayonnaise and still brought the sandwiches out incorrectly and after making a snippy remark about how they were now made how we requested on the ticket we won't be eating at this restaurant anymore."}
{"text":"Freaky fast???? Food so fast, you'll freak??? Not even close!!! I literally live down the street. 1/2 mile. I could drive and get there in 5 minutes or less. I only ordered delivery because its Friday night, we're watching a movie and didn't want to leave. It's been nearly 40 minutes - still no food. The driver even called, implying they were on the way - that was 15 minutes ago. Next time we'll just eat after the movie....Or order pizza. Never again, Jimmy Johns...Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"JJ, good and fast.  From Chicago where there is a JJ every three blocks and was excited to finally find one out here.  When I went was wearing an Iowa shirt and spoke with the owner.  His son is the manager and he plans to open another location possibly near the Midwestern campus.  Very nice employees like a lot of JJ, but liked that he was willing to talk about the operations with customers.    Once I get back there the #10 will be devoured yet another time."}
{"text":"I wrote a review for the JJ on Bell and gave it 4 stars.  A reason for this one at 3.  Same service and good employees.  However the sandwich seem shorted and less delicious.  Lacked on the sprouts and sauce, two necessary plentifulls in my book.  Since I work in the area I will of course revisit."}
{"text":"It is about time JJ got to AZ.  To long after wandering the streets in Chicago & Denver have I craved a sub after a night at the bars, or a quick delish sandwich fix.  JJ's sandwiches are no frills but all quality.  Everything actually tastes fresh, and not over-processed like other sub shops.  I could eat here everyday, but I'd die before age 35 from mayo overload.   Don't forget to get the hot peppers!   Plus, the day old bread makes a cheap, quick garlic bread at home or the perfect stomach sponge."}
{"text":"Superb service. Great value. Wonderful sandwiches!   We bought the most expensive sandwich on the menu and my wife and I had to split it because it was so big. I think the whole dinner including drinks was like $12.00 or something.   We loved the food. The French bread is so good it reminded me of my time in Louisiana.   Everybody was friendly and helpful.   LOVE LOVE LOVE!"}
{"text":"My first visit to JImmy John's Power road, and It was fantastic!  The cashier new regulars by name and their orders:)  That alone makes them top notch in my book.  I will return"}
{"text":"I have to write a review for Jimmy John's customer service because I am always so impressed!  Their sandwiches are lackluster - especially the vegetarian one - but their 5 star staff makes up for it.  The staff here always goes above and beyond - they are always quick, efficient, and do little things that end up making a big difference.  For example, I've had to order box lunches for office meetings several times. When taking my order over the phone, the person will ask me what name they can write on the bag for that particular item - that way, I do not have to go through each box, opening up the sandwich, trying to figure out who gets what back at the office - genius! And so simple...  When they were doing their special $1 sandwich promotion, I decided to stop by, even though the line was out the door and several stores down.  My cheapness kicked in, and I was ready to spend my whole lunch break waiting in 110 degree heat - but Jimmy John's wouldn't let that happen! I had was inside and had my sandwich within 12 minutes. Super impressed! The manager also gave me one of their pickles for free when  I told him I had never tried them.  Keep up the good work, JJs, but maybe add a little more \"meat\" to the veggie sandwich..."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Jimmy John's once in October and once in November and both times the bottom of the bread was tough.  This was disappointing especially since we had treated other guests for lunch."}
{"text":"Everyone loves this place.... Except for me.   I've ventured to JJ's the past three weeks to meow down on a sandwich before my long night class. All 3 times I've arrived at this location, there are 4+ people working behind the counter but it takes a while to get acknowledged to take an order. Whatever, it's all good, I'm in no hurry. But what really put me off during my last visit was a manager taking a few minutes to berate an employee for ringing up a previous order incorrectly. It was strange and very unwelcoming.   As for the important part (the grub), I have to say the menu is a bit confusing and doesn't cater to my personal tastes at all. I enjoy a sandwich with quality meat and lots of veggies. While I like the bread at JJ's,  I find the turkey cheap and and the veggie selection/quality sad. :-( The sandwiches I've tried (Turkey Tom and something else with a beachy name) lacked any zest or flavor. I got guacamole on a sub once and it was the same stuff Taco Bell uses. I do enjoy the sprouts and salt & vinegar chips, though.  I'm going to give this location 3 stars because it's a great place to kill time in between classes. It's also reasonably priced, clean, and quick. I think I need to take an experienced Jimmy Johner with me to tell me what's good."}
{"text":"this was my 2nd visit and once again I'm nOt impressed! Sandwiches are blah, bread has no flavor and wasn't fresh....2 bites into it and my bread broke apart, the sandwich had so much mayo everything inside was sliding out (napkins are hidden behind the counter - so I had to keep asking for more because they would only give 2 at a time) sandwich tasted like a mayo lettuce sandwich, the other ingredients were well hidden :/ The 2 stars given are for the customer service which didn't kick in until the end of our meal when the guys decided to ask us how our food was,  up until then we were ignored (aside from taking our order). The location is hidden so don't make the effort to find it....go to Capriottis--down the street at the Summerlin Mall"}
{"text":"Love these sandwich everyday. Even though they don't offer chicken, they offer so much selection of turkey, beef, vegi, and tuna."}
{"text":"Awful customer service! So disappointed. I often visit the jimmy John's in Los Angeles and have always had a positive experience. Unfortunately, not so for this location. The  \"shift manager\" \"David\" refused to inform me of whom his supervisor was.  I will not visit and spend my hard earned at Jimmy John's any longer."}
{"text":"Apparently being fast only applies to locations that are with in a .5 mile radius. Make a note if you live in Old Town but you're more than .5 miles away they won't deliver. Great marketing ploy though. #FirstWorldProblems"}
{"text":"The second time in a row they've messed up my order. I work at an office, and whenever we order more than two orders something always gets messed up. The first time we ordered a few sandwiches, two chips and one cookie. They bring us two cookies and one chip. Today we ordered 3 sandwiches and 2 bags of chips we got all sandwiches but only one bag of chips! So I call them and tell them they forgot a bag of chips, the apologize and say they will have the driver come right back and bring my chips. So I've been waiting over and hour starving for them to bring chips, I call back and they apologize again and say they will have someone come right out . DO NOT order from this location if you want your order taken correctly. Now my whole lunch hour has been wasted. Thanks a lot Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"I thought the delivery service was fast and courteous but the sandwich was nothing to brag about. It was a tuna sandwich that had cheese and I tasted more cheese than tuna. I believe I could have saved my money and made a better tuna sandwich at home. It seemed a little pricey as well for just tuna. It was my 1st time ordering and the service is fine it's the food that needs work. I was disappointed. $13 for tuna, a bag of chips and a cookie. Seriously?! Next time I'll just save my money and make my own...it would have been better."}
{"text":"I like Jimmy Johns. I really like their Tuna fish sandwich. It is one of the best for a fast food sandwich shop. There is another sandwich shop across the street that I like a lot more but when I am in the mood for Tuna or my coworkers want to come here I will stop by.  They are super fast I will give them that. There have only been a few times that I have been able to get my drink before they have my sandwich ready. I am just not a super fan. They are a thousand times better than the mega giant of fast food sandwich shops, Dumb Way."}
{"text":"WOW, This Place Is Perfect! , Where to start- this place is super chill I love it ! Placing orders over the phone for delivery is as easy as 1 - 2 -3. Then poof their fast and friendly delivery driver is at the door and they are always cool people, then I rip open the bag and I get my hands on my #11 country club pretty much the best turkey sandwich ever, then the jimmy chips ! Whatttt these chips are amazing, BBQ flavor preferably, and I always get 2 bottles of Dasani water THATS NOT ALL they have the softest most delicious chocolate chip cookies too ! I love this place order it now ! Call them they will deliver only 1 sandwich of its juts you like me your straight call them up :)"}
{"text":"The delivery is fast and consistently good. Online ordering is great.   It's annoying they don't give you napkins which is why no five star for me. When I'm home it's not a big deal but sitting in my office it really takes away from the convenience factor and I get that I can ask them but 1) should I really have to? and 2) even when I've done that in the past they forget them.   I think it's kind of a joke they don't give napkins by default honestly especially for delivery.   Having said that I still order from here all the time so why would they change?"}
{"text":"I love JJ's and order all of the time. This review is for this location in particular.   The following are my two key takeaways that occur from this location on a consistent basis and I'm using a sample if at least 7 or 8 different orders:  Good:  Fast delivery times and the drivers are always friendly, clean, and super nice.   Bad:  The bread. The bread at this location is  consistently not good. Hard, stiff, and not the normal awesome JJ bread that we get at other JJ locations.  THIS is the reason for the 3-star rating as the bread is The most important part.   I find myself ordering delivery from this JJ's because it's convenient and there aren't many other delivery options."}
{"text":"Sandwich was okay. Nothing to write home about. Not very many choices and not hot subs. Doubt we'd eat there again unless it was the only place around."}
{"text":"This is my usual JJ's and they are very fast and friendly when you go in. However, their delivery is anything but \"freaky fast\". As of this minute I've been waiting 42 minutes for our sandwiches. When I called at the 30 minute mark I was told the delivery driver had just left and had a couple other deliveries ahead of mine. \"Sorry\""}
{"text":"Just called to place an order. Customer service is terrible. That had to have been the rudest guy to ever pick up a phone. Never mind, I'll spend my money elsewhere :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Super quiet and super cozy! Sure during the day time it might be a bit crowded. I mean come on. Their food is amazing! I literally can't not make a recommendation. Try everything at least once! I made a promise to myself after trying my very first sandwich months ago that I would just go right down the list. Which is super easy cause literally this is one of my favorite places. Couple times a month hits the spot! Please go here it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"It gets three stars because if Jimmy Johns great quality.  The girl behind the counter on Friday evenings needs some training on customer service.  A lot of \"I know what you ordered\" shit with her and our order still got fucked up.  Also the little college girl smirk doesn't work when you can't do your job very well."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is an ok place but its not healthy on the product they use. But one thing that concerns me is that when you place an order for delivery where does Freaky fast comes into play when it comes to Delivery the customer food and with out putting the other people cyclist, pedestrian at risk and breaking the law/      I have caught delivery drivers breaking the law running stop signs, speeding failing to yield to pedestrian,etc just so they can deliver the customer order in time. Anyone seen this or experience this one thing is to make sure you are charged for what you get and what you order because they wont fix it."}
{"text":"If you need a quick bite, definitely choose this location for delivery!  They are scary fast!!  No matter when I order from here, the order is always right and delivery is speedy.   I work in the industry,  so I can definitely appreciate it."}
{"text":"This is my local delivery jimmy johns to my house and to my office. I would like to say they never take more than 15 minutes to deliver. The service is extremely helpful. I have been working all day in my house an starving and they came to my rescue!!! With extras- tip their delivery people and i promise they will be amazing to you. I never have a complaint! Its not the greatest sub in the world- basic but the service will keep me coming back forever."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here once again today! Got there about 15 minutes before they opened and the manager saw me knocking at the door. He was more than happy to let me come in and get my one sandwich very quickly. Did it with a great attitude and made taking early lunch to my husband much easier. They always have excellent customer service and the food is always great. Very clean too."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here was Oct 2012. My whole office ordered sandwiches to be delivered. I asked for no mayo, when I got my sandwich there was mayo on both sides. When I called back to ask for my correct sandwich to be delivered, the person I spoke to acted so inconvenienced and told me I would have to have the incorrect sandwich to show them. The delivery driver opened it up and inspected it before he would even hand me the new sandwich. Both the person on the phone and the driver were very rude about the whole situation and I swore I would never eat there again.   So, it took me until Feb 26th, 2014 to break down and try it again. A co-worker went and picked up and sandwich for each of us. I paid extra for a \"club style\" sandwich and added onions. When I got my order, it was on regular bread no onions. Reciept was correct, just the sandwich in the bag was wrong. My co-worker's sandwich also had two mistakes. I didn't even bother calling to fix it this time, it'snot worth dealing with the poor customer service. I won't be eating there a 3rd time."}
{"text":"If a bread sandwich with a two paper thin slices of meat is up your alley, you will love this place! They claim \"Gourmet Sandwiches\"? Are you kidding me? I am not sure why Jimmy John's are popping up everywhere, the sandwiches are a joke! Don't waste you money or taste-buds."}
{"text":"Have received deliveries from the Settler's ridge location numerous times and suddenly today we are out of the delivery range. Guess we won't be back"}
{"text":"Over an hour and 10 minutes. You'd think if you can't be freaky fast, then you could at least text or email or call with a polite heads-up! We're just two minutes away... we could have driven to get it ourselves."}
{"text":"My office orders from this location often ....I put off ordering with the team but today I decided to join them ....the Bread was stale and very hard to chew. Very Disappointing!"}
{"text":"I love this Jimmy John's. Everyone there is always so nice and the sandwiches are amazing! Also I've never had better salt and vinegar chips."}
{"text":"So i place my order over the phone at 11:05am and gave them all my info including address etc. I pay for my meal via my credit card and assure me that my food will be delivered shortly. 20+ minutes lares I get a phone call from the manager saying hey we are sorry but we can't deliver there. Mind you I have payed and they have already verified the address. What kind of bullshit half asses business are you running!?! This is completely unprofessional! You need to step up your customer service Jimmy Johns!"}
{"text":"They don't listen! Plain and simple! I call to order a sub and tell the guy on the phone ONLY MEAT AND CHEESE. He replies so no veggies? I say again ONLY MEAT AND CHEESE. Then he asks \"so you don't want mayo\"? How ridiculously hard is it to do your job and fucking LISTEN! ONLY MEAT AMD CHEESE can only mean 1 fucking thing! You need to step up your customer service Jimmy Johns!"}
{"text":"Fast but sloppier than other JJs, spread is normally contained to one half of the sandwich, which makes for a sad second half."}
{"text":"I was working in the area so I stopped in for lunch today. I've never been to Jimmy John's, I typically eat at Subway so I was curious what this chain had to offer.  The positive: - The dining area is large and there is plenty of seating. - The employees are friendly - The sandwich was good  The negative: - The service was slow. There was only a handful of people in the store but it still took about 15 minutes to get my sandwich. - I wasn't given any napkins and there are none readily available. I guess you have to ask? - No spinach  - More expensive than Subway  For a chain it's not bad, I'll probably try it again sometime."}
{"text":"I usually don't like to give bad reviews but this one really got under my skin. I placed my order and paid for it with cash. The guy at the cash register said my change was $14.32. he handed my change and walked away very fast away from the register. When I looked at my change to put a tip in their tip jar I noticed that I was a dollar short. When I confronted the guy instead of taking the dollar out of the register and apologizing because we all make mistakes it happens not a big deal, he takes it out of his pocket and hands it over, gives me a dirty looks and walks away. That is very uncool of him to do that and I will never buy a sandwich from their shop ever again."}
{"text":"The sandwich is always great but the delivery is SO SLOW. I work around the corner from this location and it seems as though they take at least a half hour every time to deliver my sandwhich. This location is not freaky fast."}
{"text":"Trying to find something to eat on way to the  Camelback Stadium and searched Yelp. The place was bright and clean. Staff extraordinarily friendly. I'm on the no carb diet and when I walked in and looked up and saw sandwiches and more sandwiches I was concerned. However the clerk offered me a no carb/protein alternative sandwich and I jumped on it. I selected the Italian. It was one of the best freshest sandwiches I had in a long time.   In the future I will be searching out Jimmys when I can."}
{"text":"I've had two negative experiences with this Jimmy John's. The first time, I ordered online and waited for my delivery for about an hour. I called and was told it would be about 15 more minutes. After another phone call to check, I was told one of the delivery drivers quit mid-shift. After a third phone call, I cancelled everything since we were going on 2 hours from my initial order time. The manager I spoke with told me that she was going to refund the money (I never received the refund), and give me a $12 credit on our account. She told me all we needed to do was order from this same phone number.   We just tried to place another delivery order, figuring we'd use the credit while we had it, and first had to argue that this actually happened and that we should have been credited, and then were told that the credit couldn't be used on deliveries. I've ordered from other Jimmy John's locations in the past, but this one is a disaster."}
{"text":"I love jimmy johns subs but their delivery is below par. The delivery is always fast but the past 4 times I've ordered delivery my order has been wrong. It's not that hard to make a sandwich."}
{"text":"I know their slogan is \"freaky fast\" but they are a little too aggressive when you walk in the door. Before I walk up to the counter, they ask what I want. Um...let me look at the menu please. I've only been to Jimmy John's twice and it's not bad. Both times I ordered the #9 Italian Night Club (Genoa salami, capicola, ham, provolone, lettuce, tomato, onions, mayo & vinaigrette.) It was pretty standard for an Italian sub.   One thing, they are very fast! You have your sandwich in less than a minute after you order it. I'm not sure why, but they didn't give me a bag which I thought was odd. I didn't only have a sandwich, I had chips too. I do like that you have the option to get the sandwich wrapped in lettuce, instead of bread. Not all sub places over that.  My only complaint is that all of the sandwiches are cold. I would try something else if I could have it hot or grilled. I would only go here again if it was the only option. Nothing against Jimmy John's but there are other places in the area that I like much better."}
{"text":"Don't ever order delivery from here. They got my order wrong three times! When they were sending the 3rd sub out, I waited 40 Minutes then called them back. They didn't even have my correct address! When I called them back after my 3rd sub was delivered, the manager tried to make excuses! I told him there was no excuse for this. I'm never ordering from or going to this jimmy johns again."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am huge fan of jimmy johns and was excited to see one open in our area!! However went through the drive thru waited more than 10 min and I was the only one in the drive thru. Not one comment from the person who took my payment, no one more minute, no thank you, no have a nice day!! What a shame!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Extremely Rude employees. We got the #5 and it was bland and tasteless.  Been to the one in streetsboro and it was great but I will pass on the Solon location"}
{"text":"Food was fast and fresh, the crew was real polite and helpful. It's only a sub place so either you want cold cuts or get out. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Sad excuse for a sandwich, hardly any turkey and the wife ordered hot peppers but got onions.... Getting just like McDonald's third time in a row order wrong!!"}
{"text":"I use to think this place was really good. My mind changed however once I got a sandwich with bad meat. I'm sure it was a mistake but it should be better looked at. I also have had friends who have worked there and noticed bad meat and the manager said they still had to use it. So I'm not sure if it's just the location or if all jimmy johns are like that. I will say though, their bread is really good"}
{"text":"this location is half a mile from my office, so i have ordered online here at least twice a month for the past year, even though i don't particularly care for their sandwiches. what kept me coming back is free delivery. today, my first order of the 2018 calendar year, a $2 delivery fee appeared on my online order. i looked back at an order placed in mid-december and they also have decreased the price of my sandwich by $1.50 (it's probably not worth that, either), so the net price differential is minimal. with a delivery fee, though, i might as well order from grubhub or doordash and get a better sandwich elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love Love Love JJ's!!!!!!! They are a 1000 x's better then subway and Jersey Mike's. So glad one opened up by my house! Will be going there often! :D"}
{"text":"Worst Jimmy John's I have been to and I've been to several locations throughout IL, FL, CA and NV. The service was extremely slow (they weren't busy) and the employees were rude."}
{"text":"What the French toast! Worst jimmy johns ever. Look at this sandwich. Picture worth a thousand words."}
{"text":"This location used to be great and fast, but not anymore. Most of the time the music is so loud, they can't even understand your order. And when they can hear it, they don't pay close attention and usually screw it up. There is little or no communication between employees and when there is, they half ass pay attention. I've had more than one order messed up and I've repeated it 3 times, to 3 different people. Not exactly sure what's going on at this location, but with the new price increases, they better STEP IT UP. I will never be going to this particular location again tho, I'm done."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's a daily thing but this place smells like an old mop bucket. Makes me wonder how clean they keep the place.   As for the food, bread was on the stale side and service wasn't so friendly."}
{"text":"This place is quite the rave! Everyone has been telling me to Try Jimmy Johns!  I could not believe how fast they made my sandwich! Before i even put a way my wallet my sandwich was ready!.....Really i didn't even know you could make a sandwich that fast! That kinda sketches me out!  It was great tasting as well! However they did mess up on my order, but they were really nice about fixing there mistake! All together i thought Jimmy Johns was average."}
{"text":"This review is for Jimmy John's on 33rd Street and Bell Road.  Can't find it on the Yelp listing.  It was my first time buying an italian combo at JJ's.   Here what I found: 1.  The bread is too mealy. 2. Not enough meats and no pepperoni.  An italian sub with NO PEPPERONI?????      In all fairness, I just noticed on the menu that for another dollar I could have gotten more deli meat. Really, I have to upgrade to get a decent sandwich?  I should have. 3.  They gave me nice hot peppers, but it didn't compensate for the lack of flavor of the sandwich... Sorry.  I will be going back to Capriotti's.  I really like their italian combo.  There is so much deli meat in them that you can nearly close the sandwich."}
{"text":"I have been eating sandwiches at this place almost three days a week. I normally just get a the number #12 which is the turkey sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes, provolone cheese, guacamole, mayo, and I have them add hot peppers. This place prepares the sandwiches SUPER fast and it is completed within 15 seconds after paying. if you are in a hurry and want a decent sandwich this is your stop!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here. It's one of my favorite sub restaurants. However, the delivery service is terrible. I always order when I'm at work, which is in the PV Mall. It regularly takes a half an hour for food to be delivered, with my max wait time having broken an hour once or twice. There's nothing freaky fast about the delivery service at all."}
{"text":"Tucked in a small plaza. The service is fast and employees are welcoming. The only reason I gave then 4 stars is because they do not deliver past jones and tropicana. Great subs and price is not bad"}
{"text":"Fast. Easy. Tasty. Inexpensive. Simple in the best sense of the word. Knocks the socks off of Earl of Sandwich. My husband and I happened upon this place today while leaving our Vegas weekend back for home in Cali. We are bummed Jimmy John's hasn't franchises there yet!! The friendliness & helpfulness of staff along with the SPEED & simple-done-perfectly concept of the place won us over. We got a punch card & do plan to use it every time we return!"}
{"text":"The dolt at the register was rude as hell because I wasn't an expert on their condiments. This is only the 3rd time I've been to a JJ, also the last, so I have no idea what they offer. The imbred who made the sandwiches threw them at me on the counter and then told me to bag them myself and get napkins if I wanted some.   I've had friendlier service from the TSA.  Also, when we went eat the sandwiches, nothing about my order was correct.   This will be my last visit to a JJ."}
{"text":"Okay I have grown to love this spot!!!  ** I am in a good and stable relationship with the Beach Club sub right now!!!   :) The dynamic combination of Turkey, provolone, avocado, lettuce, tomato and sprouts with added hot peppers and super light mayo!!!  ********Oh soo delicious!!! ********** PLUS!!! The staff working here is oh soo nice!!! Maybe the last time that I came here I over analyzed the place, which I sometimes do!! So I apologies for my previous review, I now know where you guys place your napkins and I'm no longer feeling pressured to make a fast order!!   See ya around!!! :)"}
{"text":"Fast, efficient, and CHEAP sub sammiches.   For less than $10 bucks you can get some really good fresh/quality sandwiches and fresh bread. I'm a huge breadie-- so I'm super particular about my bread. JJ has really good addicting warm bread. It doesn't get soggy like I know subway does.  I always get the \"vito\" which is your classic italian sub. Comes with three different kinds of meat and upon request they can add some pepperchini's to it.  They make the sandwiches so fast and are always friendly. They really know how to deal with crowds because I've gone on an extremely busy day during lunch AND was able to get in/out in about 10 min --(for 2 orders that's pretty impressive.)  They are conveniently located in the shopping center that Starbucks is in so it's easy to find AND they deliver fo freeeeee!! Which makes it every college students dream during finals week. To not have to leave the UNLV lied library and be able to get food delivered to you is a saving grace-- believe me.   JJ was definitely one of my food rotations during the college days."}
{"text":"Literally walked in at 11:35AM and walked out with my sandwich at 11:37. And the phone was ringing off the hook. So convenient, love this place"}
{"text":"Veggie un-wich with hot peppers and sprouts is what this girl is about (although they are a little too generous with the sprouts)! Delivery and ordering in, staff is always friendly, accommodating, and speedy.  I mean it's a sandwich shop-  my expectations include: making sandwich that doesn't take 15 minutes.   THEY WORK REALLY HARD BY THE WAY! Great Job guys and gals!"}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: Yimmy Yohn's (they're soft J's).  It's Jimmy John's, sure, but I always liked this location better than others. It's close to the engineering campus at Madison, it's off Regent Street by all the bars, and it's clean and inviting. Oh, and the workers are always super friendly."}
{"text":"Deliveries here sucks! I called three jimmy johns that are near by like within 9-15 mins drive and none of them could deliver to my house. I give jimmy johns no star if I could"}
{"text":"Great location with upbeat staff! went in about 15 mins till close on first Friday and one guy sat outside and chatted with me and my friend. All locations are quick and fresh. 16th street and Camelback, 44street and Thomas and the drive through one near alma school is the best! LOVE The Vito and Turkey Tom w bbq chips of course!"}
{"text":"So, I work at a hospital down the street from this location- our doctors order food from here daily, and we always sign their credit receipts for them. We just had an order delivered, and the guy honest to god said, in a front of a lobby full of people, that he didn't want us to sign, because \"She hasn't left a tip yet, and I want to make sure I get my tip\" when asked if he was serious, he said, \"Yeah man, I gotta get paid\"   Wow. Just wow."}
{"text":"We work down the street, and order from here daily. Normally, we don't have any issues, but today's order was a mess.   We called- for one sandwich. An easy order, I would think.   When placing the order, the gentleman on the phone was very rude, speaking to other people while taking my order, and then hung up on me without saying good bye, or thank you.  Normally, our orders are delivered within minutes, this time, it took nearly 20.   After opening the bag, the sandwich was wrong. We asked for wheat bread, and was given the regular roll. I know, I know, you're thinking this doesn't sound like a big deal, but when you have braces, like I do, the bread type is important. I can't eat the hard roll.   Now, I'm fairly pissed off. I want my dinner, it took forever to get, and now, it's wrong. So I call, and ask for a supervisor, and my call was given to Darius. He was very flippant, and didn't really care that my order was wrong.   That was really the deal breaker. They care so little about our business, that they blew me off. No worries, Jimmy John's, I'll take my lunch business elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time here. Only second time at a Jimmy John's. Asked if they had salads or could make a sandwich a salad. Answer was no from cashier. Started to order #6 vegetarian when the person making sandwiches said I could get an unwich, a lettuce wrap instead of bread. I ordered the #6 vegetarian unwich. It normally comes with an avocado spread. I asked for that to be on the side, but was told they were unable to do any sauces on the side. They offered mayo packets instead.  The wrap was very good. Cucumber, tomato, alfalfa sprouts and two nice slices of provolone wrapped in lettuce. A salad in a salad.   It was very clean inside. Service could have been better when ordering. Food was extremely fresh. Prices a bit high. Not having a small cup to put some sauce in for on the side is just dumb.   Three stars."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch choice in the uptown area. Their delivery times are extremely fast. On several occasions from online  order submission to doorbell ring is 10 minutes. Quick fulfilling meal delivered for under 8 bucks."}
{"text":"This place was a complete dissapointment. Their bread was hard. There is nothing special about their sandwiches. Most of their sandwiches could easily be made at home. It seems like a sandwich someone would pack their child for lunch. Subway offers better sandwiches than this place. I will never recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"The worst customer service at this location. It was convenient for me but i sure will not come here again. Rather take my business somewhere a little out my way."}
{"text":"I am super frustrated with Jimmy Johns right now. I am trying to get sandwiches delivered to my address. I am directly in the middle of 2 stores. I called the location on pecos, after giving the person my order he tells me I have called the wrong store. Even though I am less than 2 miles away from this location. He tells me to call the location on Warner. So I do so, they say I am out of range and I need to call the pecos store.. even though I'm less than 3 miles away from this location. I'm not very sure what the ranges are but if I'm less than 3 miles away I'm not sure how I can't get delivery.."}

{"text":"I was overall please with the service and food! Fast delivery and the sandwiches were great! Only complaint is that I ordered a diet coke and there was so much ice that I took a sip and it was gone. I was expecting more than a shot of soda with my meal. But my kids really liked how big the pickles were!"}
{"text":"When there's no food at home, I hit up Jimmy John's for a good ol #10 Hunter's Club (Roast Beef Sandwich) with Dijon Mustard. Can't go wrong with it as long as you like beef. Well, except they messed up the sandwich once by adding onions to it for some reason. Raw onions = -1 star."}
{"text":"Dude on his phone the entire time my wife is trying to buy a sandwich, is this typical of this Jimmy John's? I'm not used to having to wait so long to get our food. I guess we'll end up going somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"How is it that you don't deliver somewhere less than 2 miles away? Pretty stupid if you ask me."}
{"text":"no meat on a $5.50 sandwich, charged $1.25 for a pickle and woudlnt even cut it and put it on the sandwich. Better off going to subway- I just ate this thing and I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"This is the worst location of Jimmy Johns I've ever been in, my husband almost threw up from the revolting overwhelming smell coming from where they make the sandwiches. Not a large selection of sandwiches, no other cheese aside from provolone, this guy was mopping next to where they make the sandwiches, while sandwiches are being made! Disgusting and unclean!!! I asked them not to put mayo on my sandwich because I'm allergic they slathered my sandwich all over the bread and meat in mayo! I took it back and asked for a refund due to the disgusting odor turned my stomach, they said no refunds, they would make me the sandwich again and repeatly I asked them not to, and they did it anyway. My advice to anyone stuck here trying to get a fast meal, don't go in here unless you want to see your lunch in reverse!! I believe they put the mayo on my sandwich on purpose, because when I came back in there the cashier turned her back to me.    Updated review: Everything that you stated here is completely untrue I'm not into getting into an argument with someone that worked at the establishment however you are being untruthful. I did not order the meatball sub my teenagedaughter requested it, shows how much you were paying attention to the clients order. I am sorry that you were upset with my review but maybe you should keep your store clean and not ignore what the customer is ordering. I had not finished paying when I asked for  no mayo, I was specific about that because I'm allergic. Another lie that you told. I understand keeping the store clean by mopping, but not while the food is being made this makes the restaurant smell terrible, and the person mopping did it next to where the food was being made. You offer free card yes, but I'm so turned off from this restaurant and I will never return. The choices are scarce but that is not the reason I will not be returning, this location I highly doubt has an A+ rating reading the reviews here I agree! By the way you were not busy when we were there"}
{"text":"Third time I've ordered the same sandwich, every time it is wrong! I request extra vinegar & oil, extra onion, and extra lettuce. I get a ton of lettuce, no extra onion and no vinegar. Last time I took back my sandwich to have it remade, the Sr. sandwich maker stated that most people do not shake up the bottle of oil and vinegar before putting it on, and the separation causes just the oil to come out. Maybe everyone who makes sandwiches should know how to correctly make one. My last complaint is that they make your sandwich exceptionally fast, my sandwich looked like  a homeless person with no work experience made it. The meat was barely in the bread, most of it was on the side of the sandwich and looked  thrown together. I will only go to Jersey Mikes or Subway (and Subway really sucks!) from now on and suggest whoever reads this to do the same because it is literally across the street, 18th St. and Camelback Rd.  You suck Jimmy John's..."}
{"text":"This place is definitely A-Ok, the sandwiches are good.  The staff are great, and as much as I enjoy eating here I just have to say that I really don't see a difference between your subways and Quizno's.  It really is just a new spot and I am sure will continue to be successful, giving it more stars would will depend on where this place is a few years from now."}
{"text":"Very fast service, friendly staff, and very clean. Was in and out in less than 4 mins. Definitely a great option when on a short lunch break. I tried the beach club and that was delicious! Will for sure be coming back and checking out their other sandwiches"}
{"text":"They were all very nice and gave me a club discount !! I really wish they would deliver to my store location !! We are only 2.4 miles but it's always a great sandwich!! Thank you guys and gals"}
{"text":"So I placed an order for delivery and come to find out that they  don't deliver to my house which is only 2 miles away from this location. I'm literary less than 5 minutes away it would have taken longer to make the sandwiches then to deliver to house. I think the commercials give an false impression. I won't be ordering from this location or any other."}
{"text":"I love that you can literally walk into this location and be out in about 5 minutes. There's never a line here even during a busy lunch or dinner rush. I always see at least 4 or 5 people behind the counter, either making the sandwiches or baking the bread.   It's a small location so not the ideal indoor dining spot, but love that this is inside the bakery square plaza.  I love that JJ's sells yesterday's bread for $0.49! I bought a few and they're still really soft."}
{"text":"I wish they had other bread options (they have wheat BREAD but it's like as delicious as the french bread).  Fast service... Definitey can grab n go if you're in a rush.  My favorite is the BLT sandwich!"}
{"text":"As always, sandwich is great.  I've become accustomed to the fun, lively atmosphere of a Jimmy John's. This one does not fit the bill. Eveyone is very serious. That fun atmosphere is one reason I love Jimmy John's. I ordered my food to go. The girl didn't put it in a sack. NO BIG DEAL. I asked for a bag and the manager came over and told her tell me to get it myself, that she shouldn't be cross contaminating the food and bags.  That's ok, buthe was just kind of a douche about it. I hope the customer service gets beer.  That being said, I'll keep coming. This is just a one time thing, I'm sure."}
{"text":"Don't order for delivery, took them almost an hour to deliver 2 sandwiches, 1 mile away."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches fast service sooo glad we have this place on this side of town. My biggest problem is which sandwiches is the best"}
{"text":"There is a strange energy in this over hyped sandwich shop.  Maybe it's the cramped space that becomes immediately apparent when you enter the front door.  As you stand looking at the menu, the door opens behind you, and opens again behind you.  Now the rush is on as the cashiers try to herd you like cattle to make an order.    With people breathing down your neck, you must hurry...HURRY!  I picked a LuLu Club, they asked if I wanted cheese on it and I told them that I did.  I told them I wanted a combo special...I don't even think there was a combo \"special.\"   With the transaction completed I went to seek out a seat.  But don't get the one by the pick-up window.  Somebody while waiting for their sandwich is going to probably touch you with their backside.  So I picked a spot in the back.  Damn, was this place loud. Loud music, loud employees and whatever else was going on.  Thinking I head my number, I made my way to the counter.  I picked up the three sandwich's and managed not to offend the table sitting in the danger touching zone.  After eating my rather bland sandwich, I began to break down the bill.  My combo sandwich with chips and drink was expensive by sandwich shop standards.  I also noticed that the cheese the cashier asked me about was an additional item that I was charged for.  I reckon that I may have totally missed something between the dull, boring sandwich and the 19 year old douche bag worker that almost shoulder checked me while he was filling his drink cup in the already confined spaces of this place.  Never has the idea of a Port Of Subs #5 or a five dollar foot long ever looked or sounded so appealing."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times and got what I expected.  The staff was friendly, the resturant was clean and they make a mean $5 tuna sub."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns but haven't eaten here since they renamed their sandwiches so it took me a minute to figure out the menu. The cashier was very impatient and had an attitude when I asked if they changed the names of the sandwiches (she said no they didn't which they very obviously did, the names of what the sandwiches used to be called were under the new names but they still are rolling out a revamped menu so she lied) and she kept glaring at me and overall just being rude to me."}
{"text":"Amazing subs!! I love the Gargantuan...one of my favorite sandwiches. But, it's like a freezer in the restaurant and the service isn't the best. (They say they offer catering, but couldn't give olive oil and vinegar on the side because they had no containers...) turn on the charm and turn off the ac!"}
{"text":"Idiots can't even do a simple delivery. Lost my business and future business. They juggle me around from one location to another. Ended up not getting food. Thx"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a sub from Jimmy Johns-perfect place for lunch. They deliver or a quick place to stop in and get your order.  One of the best secrets is the nine grain bread you can choose to get your sub on instead of the white roll. It is so tasty!  I always go for the beach club-turkery, provolone cheese, tomatoe, lettuce, and guacamole.  One of my favorite things about this place is the option to get guacamole on the sub.  I also highly recommend the vegggie sub-sprouts, cheese, tomatoe, cucumber and more gucamole! Their cookies which are huge (especially the chocolate chip) are delicious!"}
{"text":"Still love the Club Lulu sandwich, but the service here can be hit or miss."}
{"text":"We like Jimmy John's however I hate that they don't bag your sandwiches (obviously I don't mind holding just 1 sandwich).  I bought 3 sandwiches and when I asked for a bag, the girl said \"its right there\" and pointed to an area behind the counter right under where they set the sandwiches. Naturally, a customer assumes its inappropriate to reach behind the counter, so maybe they should place the bags elsewhere in a more public view and appropriate for customers to grab if they feel they need one."}
{"text":"As much as I love JJ and its sandwiches, at this place I keep on breaking my personal record of how much of bad service I can tolerate. Just to give you the idea, I've been coming to this place for close to two years. And when someone after this much time leaves a one-star feedback, there is something wrong indeed. First, and I noticed it from day one, there is a sign on the wall that the place is calling yesterday's bread for 50 cents. As you you experience your first sandwich here, you'll feel like an actor of the Groundhog Day: I've been to make JJ's and as many sandwiches as this place sells, the bread is far from being fresh. Second, the place is always playing music and playing it so loud that I cannot hear myself think. I installed decibel measuring app and clocked the noise level tonight at 110dB - this is a noise level of a nightclub, your head placed between the engines of two roaring choppers. The lowest this level has gone down to today was 78dB - definitely louder than one's comfort zone. This is a construction site noise level, and I am the only customer at this place. Others walk in, rapidly get uncomfortable and I watch them leave order and leave as if running away from the sound plague. Third, the professionalism of people working here deserves a total makeover. Staff screams (having some weird fun), drags chairs across the floor back and forth while cleaning, throws empty buckets across the kitchen - all making you feel very uncomfortable, even unsafe knowing how many wackos are out there. You will find yourself in the middle of the whole-place cleaning at 7:30-8:00pm. I always ask them: Am I on your way? Yet should I? Forth, I don't know how much these people make, but smiles are not a curtesy at this place. I just stopped typing for a sec and looked at the three workers in the kitchen, and \"they don't want to be here\". Well, I do! I do want to be here, because I like JJ's, and it's close to my home. Yet this place/staff ruins the reputation of the brand. I would really like to speak with the owner of the franchise to help him keep me as a customer. As for the rest of you, wear ear plugs, expect robots taking your orders, and if they are out of tea or toilet paper they won't know it until you tell them (happens all the time at this location), yet you will enjoy watching them browsing their cell phones while you have to wait for a your tea to brew."}
{"text":"I will never eat at jimmy Johns again! Not only did they not include all the ingredients of my sandwich and when I asked for them they tried to charge me for them. I asked for added avocado and he refused to give it to me saying your sandwich is loaded wit it but by the looks of this picture it is not! I asked for extra avocado and he told me no he could not do it! This place is only still in business because of the drunk people that party on Mill Avenue and needed food after part time the quality of their sandwiches is trash the attitude of their employees are horrible the customer service is less then and I am extremely disappointed by this experience!!! I will never never never come here again! Jimmy John you can th an your employee Derrick for this review!"}
{"text":"Best subs in downtown Charlotte. Period  The ingredients are fresh and the subs are put together quickly.   The prices are also very reasonable for the quality of food you get."}
{"text":"The employees are rude and incompetent. Told them I've never been there and didn't know what to do or where to go and EmmaLee, the RUDEST (probably 16) person I've ever dealt with looks at me with a confused look and says, 'What' like she had no idea what I was talking about. ALL I SAID WAS I'D NEVER BEEN THERE. So I ask for peperonchini on my sub when I finally did get answers, they say they don't have any but have a hot peppers mix instead, I said, verbatim, 'Does it have jalepanos? If it does, I don't want it, if it does not, I want the peppers.' She proceeds to look at the other employees, not knowing what's in the hot pepper mix and gets confirmation that there are NOT jalepanos. I add peppers, pay, leave. Get back to work to eat my sandwich, take a huge bite...TO FIND JALEPANOS IN MY MOUTH. I couldn't even eat my sandwich and ended up throwing away about $7 PURELY because of the STUPID, under trained staff members who's parents CLEARLY made them get a job when they didn't want to! Have some freaking pride in your work, kids. I'd give NEGATIVE stars if I could. Never going here again and definitely telling everyone I know about my LOVELY experience with EmmaLee and Jimmy John's on Bell Rd in Surprise."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches served up quick! That's what you need at a downtown location! Very busy during the day, but you never have to wait long. Customer service is great. You are always greater with a smile & treated right. They have bike delivery service for the downtown area. Try an unwich! Jimmy Johns has the best bread around, but the unwich lettuce wrap is a slightly healthier option! Very glad this location is downtown!"}
{"text":"Simple, fast sandwiches. What else is there to say?!? I love jimmy johns! #9 italian night club made my night! The staff was friendly & I didn't realize they have a drive thru. I just wish there was a location closer to home. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"well, I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars for this place.   I've only ever ordered the \"UnWich\"--a lettuce wrap that I get filled with turkey, avo', sprouts, onions, hot peppers, and cucumbers. it's frigging delicious, with the vinegary peppers adding the perfect zing to the rest of the 'wich.  BUT, and this is a big but--they NEVER get my order right. seriously, I have to watch them assemble this(while they read it off a piece of paper) with hawks' eyes, and remind them that \"No, I don't want tomatoes\", and \"Actually, I ordered cucumber on that\". it's a right pain in the arse, to be honest.   to top it off, there's at least one guy there with an attitude problem; I'm not rude when it comes to ordering, but this dude gives me stink-eye every time I have to deal with him. whatev."}
{"text":"As a manager in the food business myself, I have to say....There are a few times in life where a meal is so perfectly crafted. You're female driver with the long black/brunette hair gives amazing customer service and is the reason I keep ordering delivery. Thank you to this location for being so amazing. You guys rock!"}
{"text":"Super fast and accurate delivery! I placed a delivery order at the Mesa VFW and the delivery man was there before I could sit back down at my place inside. Always a good sandwich and kosher pickel."}
{"text":"Dr. Mr. John,  Thank you for completing the triad of evil in this Camelback strip mall. What with you, Chipotle and Corleone's, I might just reach behemothian status by Christmas.  However, I take comfort in the fact that I can add sprouts to any sandwich for free.  Yours,  Michelle A."}
{"text":"Delicious. The website lets you make sandwiches online with live-updated nutritional information, which I did and I think I got a little carried away.  I walked in and ordered a BLT Unwich, triple bacon, avocado spread instead of mayo, onions and hot peppers, and a double add of roast beef. They took it all in stride and made exactly what I asked for as i was asking for it.   They're fast and very personable, joking around with me about the amount of calories in my custom sandwich but that I'd ordered it without bread. I informed them I did no bread to cut the gluten, not to save on calories, which then made sense to them.   Great location, I'll definitely be back. Especially since I discovered that they'll do lettuce wrap (which they call Unwich) and the online sandwich builder tool."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good, but the young kids that work behind the counter play the grunge music so friggin loud you can't stay inside too long.  I thought it was just a one time thing, but the next two times I came back it was the same thing.  Not goin' back any time soon.  I like to choose when to crank the grunge music up!  On the flip-side, maybe they blast the music to keep people from staying... it IS a tiny little place after all."}
{"text":"Yes.  Quality and Clean.  JJ's trumps Subway for sure.  This location is perfect if you're at work, at school or a hospital near by.  Good prices and from what I understand they have delivery that's freakishly fast.  Good food in a pinch."}
{"text":"They were fast, I'll give them that. And friendly, too. Obviously those are good qualities, but a sandwich shop needs other attributes, like tasty sandwiches. Even in my drunkenness the mayonnaise was overwhelming. And the lettuce. When mayo and lettuce comprise 80% of the sub, we are in trouble.  But like I said, fast. So that's good."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns has always made great sandwiches, now that they have some new management they deserve a 5 review. A few months ago I didn't want to step into this place because of the attitude that smacked you in the face on the way in. They have some new guys running the show and you can tell. Everybody is nice and their attitudes now reflect the usual freaky fast service. Keep up the good work, glad to see things have turned around."}
{"text":"I order from this location pretty much 5 days a week for lunch. I feel no shame in admitting that because the service is so great & the sandwich is always tasty! Their online ordering is the best! My info is saved which makes ordering quick & painless. You can select a specific delivery time (they're always early) or if you don't, they have been to my work in as quick as 5 minutes! They are reliable, consistent & affordable! Thank you to all the workers & drivers who have been providing me lunch the last couple months. I look forward to it everyday!"}
{"text":"Horrible Service and attendants who don't know what they were doing.  Great recipe for me never coming back."}
{"text":"Ok, definitely Freaky Fast...doesn't make it any better than a Subway or Blimpie in my opinion. These subs are bland. .. bland bland bland.  I've tried a few over the course of a couple years, only out of convenience and i JUST DON'T GET IT...nothing special, nothing I'd ever crave or reminisce over. .. just a cold sub that is made freakishly fast..   1.75 stars for being super fast and a good size of plain sandwich."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. The manager actually laughed at me when I said I was upset with the customer service. He gave me a big cocky smile and nodded to the door. I bought lunch for my whole office and asked if they could bag the food. He screamed at me ''WE DON'T DO THAT HERE!'' ''YOU WANT IT BAGGED, DO IT YOURSELF''. Everybody at my office has had the same experience they've said. Some days they will do something and the next day its something they don't do. I've read some other reviews and it looks like a very common thing at this location. Proceed with caution, don't ask for any special dressings, keep your head down, and get out is what they want."}
{"text":"Worst customer experience ever, very funny you'll want to read this. We used to take turns at the office to get food from here a couple times a week, never again. We would spend close to $80 a week but they can kiss that money goodbye. I walk in and buy the office lunch about $40 worth. I ask the kid behind the counter if he could help bag the sandwiches. He won't look at me or talk to me so I have to repeat myself. I said, ''Hey I just spent $40 can you help me bag the food?'' the manager screams across the whole line at me ''WE DON'T DO THAT HERE! YOU WANT IT BAGGED DO IT YOURSELF!'' I was shocked obviously and told him this is ridiculous but wasn't that suprised as they have a ton of problems at this location and the manager is a child. I told him we spend a lot of money in here, that's completely unacceptable to scream at a customer. He just laughed and encouraged his young staff to do the same. I stood there in shock and with a cocky grin he just nodded to the door. Like I said he's a man child, the other people in the office will go in one day and request something like extra this or that and some days they will do it and the next they won't. He'll deny ever doing it the next day even though he took the same special request the day before. I just left laughing because any grown man that acts like that obviously is only qualified to work at a place where the average age of an employee is 16 and makes minimum wage, he sure showed me right. I wrote Jimmy Johns on their corporate site and told them what happened. Their response was ''you can't expect us to bag every sandwich we make''. That was it, no apology. And I guess that's true even if I was the only customer in the whole restaurant. You can't just expect the sticker kid to stop what he's doing and put a few sandwiches in a bag. He might lose track of a sticker or fall behind. This was months ago. No word back and they still haven't seen any more of our money. I see very similar reviews on here so it seems like common a thing. It is a pretty ridiculous request even though Subway, Mr. Goodcents, Jersey Mikes, and every other one of their competitors wraps the finished product. They're special for sure."}
{"text":"The staff is lazy and rude. The food is fine but trying to get someones attention or an order right will never happen. The 7th street and Mcdowell location is the worst. The city took away most of the parking meters downtown so you have to pay for the parking garage and between the cost of parking and a mediocre sandwich and horrible service its the easiest decision to never go back."}
{"text":"I was almost involved in an automobile accident with one of your drivers. This is NOT, the first time I've seen a delivery driver for Jimmy Johns, driving recklessly. Though it is the drivers responsibility how they drive, I feel the Jimmy John Corporate Office should be shouldering some of the blame for the reckless driving, the driver's disobeying street signs or lights. After all you motto is Freaky Fast!!! And how many people are going to have to get hurt or killed before your say lives are worth more than\"Freaky Fast\" delivery?!?!?"}
{"text":"Probably eat here 2-3 times a week. Great place for a fabulous sandwich. Quick service as always. Never any complaints and my order is always made correctly! The only thing negative about this place is the location. Not the most convenient but it's still great."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. For the most part place is excellent. The tuna ALWAYS has WAY to much onion in it. Girls that work the register are often not to friendly. I'm guessing because it's a high volume store. Otherwise, I will continue to go here. Just would like to see an improvement. Highly recommend the sandwiches. Leave in the bread...:)"}
{"text":"Worst experience at this location. Waited an hour and a half and made three phone calls to find out I wasn't in the delivery area after all (I asked them to check 3 times) and no one called me to tell me driver returned back to store with my order and wasn't going to deliver it. I spoke with a manager and he was useless telling me it was his first day at that location and they were too busy to call me once driver arrived back at store."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is a fun place I don't care where it's located.  The music is turned up and the atmosphere is fun.  #1 Pepe with extra sauce is my standard order.  Tastes good every time.  I read another review about the tables not being clean.  I've run in to that a few times.  I get a napkin and wipe off the table.  I'm not eating at Ruth's Chris - it's a sandwich shop.  Note to owners - you could make the napkins a little more plentiful, and tell your employees to STOP DROPPING BREAD PANS!  BEST ICE IN TOWN.  Try it.  You'll like it."}
{"text":"Getting all the chains out of the way in one day :) This would be 5 stars if they delivered to my house, but since I have to drive to get my Turkey Tom (#4) and my Pepe (#1), then it's it a 4. I have voiced my concern to Jimmy John's corporate and you know know who you are (haha). Located next door to KO Sushi, it's a convenient location for a quick drive up (metered parking right outside) or walk up at lunchtime. Bread is great and the countless options make standing in front of the menu a fun experience.  TIP...if you want cheese on your sub, make sure to ask if it comes with the sub, because not all subs come with chesse. Some do though..."}
{"text":"Just what you'd expect from this staple in the sub business, but friendlier than any I've seen before. Maybe that's because it's not on a college campus. Either way - 5 stars it is!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is spectacular! I went in earlier than I thought it was because I was craving JJ and all the employees were friendly and happy. Definitely made me feel good being there. I had no idea one could order a sandwich wrapped in lettuce.  My new favorite. The inside was very clean as well. Definitely will be returning to this location"}
{"text":"I went in to eat and the sandwich was really good. I read in other reviews they didn't allow sandwiches to be altered but they didn't have a problem altering mine. Maybe because there was no one really in there when I went in. The staff was nice (and young) but just seemed uninterested in customer service. Not rude at all just not cheery like the other locations I've been to. My sandwich was made fast and I thought it was tasty. The only con I had with my experience was that they were cleaning everything all around me. I felt somewhat in the way and/or that I needed to leave so they could clean my table. That was the only thing that bugged me."}
{"text":"I go to this Jimmy a Johns all the or at least I used too! Shorted us on the items on on both sandwiches and when I ask for some packets I was told only one per item. I said what I come here all the time and never heard of that? I go to about 5 different ones through out the valley but not this one on Thunderbird & 83rd Ave.  Very rude crew and of course young rude manager!"}
{"text":"I ordered several subs for the construction guys building our pool. The subs had very little meat and vegetables. Mostly bread and blah. Very disappointed because I usually like Jimmy Johns. They just don't care about to go/delivery orders at this location. You don't realize how sucky they are until the driver is gone. Last time I order from there."}
{"text":"Okay i love jimmy johns. this is my go to place. i love the idea of delivering subs. like thank god its different from pizza. i like to believe this place is healthy. i love the turkey tom and totally tuna. i always get it with a pickle split in fourths and a lemonade. i definietly recommend this combination. go here!"}
{"text":"It's always good to have an alternative to Subway and Quiznos.  Even though we have Port of Subs here in Vegas, it's still a very sterile place.  Jimmy John's is finally a chain sandwich shop with some personality.  The menu has a mix of specialty and plain sandwiches.  Sub style or club style.  I went with the turkey breast \"plain slim\" with cheese.  This is great for me because \"plain slims\" are just bread and meat.  I know that makes me incredibly weird, but that's how I like my cold sandwiches.  One downfall of this place is the lack of bread selection.  Just plain french.  I asked one of the workers what the most popular sandwiches are.  She said the #9 (Italian Night Club) and #12 (Beach Club).  There is some seating, though not a lot.  You can order online and check out the catering specials.  If I'm in the area I'd check this place out again."}
{"text":"This pace sucks un friendly will not go back gain horrible music so you couldn't sit down and eat your food."}
{"text":"Ohh the italian sub is just fantastic! Thick, full, fresh! Far better than your average fast food sandwich store ! !"}
{"text":"I'm giving this Jimmy John's location one star simply because of their delivery failure. I live at 30th Ave. and Thunderbird, the store is at 59th Ave. and Thunderbird, that's a grand total distance of about 3 1/2 miles. when I called in earlier, for a delivery, I was informed that I live outside of the delivery zone. They're the closest Jimmy John's to me and they don't even have a 5 mile delivery zone!? That's crap. Therefore the one star rating."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch because the restaurant connected to it had a line going out the door - should have stood in line. Ordered avocado on my sandwich and had to search for it - so cheap.  Had iced tea only to find out they had no sweeteners - not even sugar - they didn't seem bothered by it.  Not impressed by the food or service.  Definitely wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty typically college town Jimmy Johns. The staff is over worked and would rather be out drinking with everyone else that is on Mill Ave and the costumers do not respect the restaurant. This is a deadly combination that typically makes for a pretty scuzzy food joint but I was pleasantly surprised by how clean the place was when I went in there. The staff members were all super cool and friendly even at the end of their shift. This is a great place to grab a bite to eat at the end of a long night."}
{"text":"The Earl of Sandwich would have loved this place. I have been a fan ever since they opened one of these accross the street from my house in Guatemala.   Clean, fast, friendly.... Bread is baked to perfection, quality fresh ingredients- no precut lettuce that comes in a bag like other chain sub restaurants.  Whatever you get, you have to get your 'wich with dijon mustard. The tanginess of the mustard  brings out the flavor of the bread so much that your tastebuds will go crazy."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why other people state you can't change your sub- I change mine all the time! No mayo, add spicy mustard. Never been an issue. My (and my husband's) only complaint is the French bread they use for subs- it's ok, not really soft and actually not flavorful at all. I recently switched to the wheat bread, and it's awesome. Get that instead.  I've had delivery from this specific location at least twice and it always arrives within 10-15 minutes. Last delivery guy did make a point to let me know he couldn't find my address numbers on our house, and I admit they are kinda hard to see. He seemed convinced they didn't exist (they do) but I will be replacing them nonetheless so my subs arrive even quicker. Well, and so potential emergency responders don't drive by looking for my house number while I choke on a sub. Hey, it could happen."}
{"text":"Don't go to jimmy johns they're a rip off there menu says 4.59 but it's actually 6.01 before tax seriously the delivery speed doesn't make up for the mediocre at best sandwich go to subway or sprouts farmers market both are cheaper both have bigger sandwiches and much higher quality"}
{"text":"Located within the tight confines of a small strip mall off of Charleston. Even tighter is the establishment it's self.  Upon seeing this I opted to order, get and go.  Unbeknownst to be prior to a friend telling me was that Jimmy John's offers an \"Unwhich.\"  You order up your sandwich but with no bread, same tasty ingredients (I chose the #9) all wrapped up in hearty lettuce.    While I waited I tried not to invade the airspace of those choosing to dine in.  Thankfully the unwhich was prepared in quick fashion and I was out the door.  The unwhich system they have in place is great.  When I unwrapped it from the paper and began eating it, it stayed together the whole time.  Try an unwhich but I recommend that you call ahead to order so you can be in and our quickly."}
{"text":"We go to this location frequently.  They have great sandwiches and are always so fast with their service"}
{"text":"skme of the best sandwhichs in Vegas.  Ive been here a few times for ljnch and have really enjoyed it.   I especially like the lettuce wrapped sandwhich and will be back for more"}
{"text":"I definitely don't mind this place. I work downtown and since JJ's is \"freaky fast\" it's a great option to have delivered when it's freezing out (and when I'm being lazy, let's be honest). I'm not sure what the young man's name was that delivered my sub to me today, but he was so incredibly friendly. He even called me before he left JJ's to ask which side of my building he should come in at to make it easier for ME.   My order today was the Turkey Tom but with ch-ch-ch-changes: No mayo; add provolone, hot peppers, sprouts, onions, avocado spread and oregano. So good. I'll probably be asleep at my desk in an hour."}
{"text":"I've eaten at JJ before in Utah and have always been happy with service. This place has the WORST SERVICE! It's 3/15/2016 at 1:19p I came to get a sandwich the guy at the counter just handed me my sandwich I asked him for a bag he turns and asks the girl who is making it to get me a bag. She then brings a stack of bags and places them on the counter and the guy cashier is just staring into space I ended up grabbing the bag and bagging my own sandwich! What a joke! I won't be coming back here. Get your crap together!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Slim 5 it was great! The crew was little sleepy when I was there. But not a bad place to get some food"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this location for a while now. Delivery is always fast and they never mess up your order! I've only had one time where they forgot the drink and when I called back they sent out the drink and a bag of chips less than 10 minutes later. Great food and better customer service!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  I have tried a handful of their sandwiches.  I like them.  I love their pickles too.  The food is prepared fast and consistent also."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service, with a decent price tag and delicious food! Clean facility!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! They are located on Liberty Avenue across the street from Fifth Avenue Place.  They offer three types of different sandwiches. Plain Slims which is a regular sub minus the veggies. Eight inch sub sandwiches and Giant Club Sandwiches which have twice the meat and cheese. You can choose between two types of bread (french and seven grain).   You can also get a low carb lettuce wrap called a JJ Unwich if your watching your calories.  If your really hungry or just want to have your own \"Man vs Food\" moment go for The JJ Gargantuan. It consists of genoa salami, sliced smoked ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey and provolone cheese on a french bun smothered with onions, mayo, lettuce and tomato covered with homemade Italian dressing. It is utterly amazing! I think I have a tear in my eye."}
{"text":"Been a while since I been here, but this was THE place to go to after a night of bar hopping. The bros behind the counter always remembered my order, and the service was always quick. The dining area was always dirty, but that's no surprise when it's near 2 AM, busy as hell, and most of the customers are drunk."}
{"text":"Alright, I'm gonna start with the food. It's good. Not bad. Decent. I probably would eat here again if they delivered to where I live but dining in, no. I will go elsewhere. The customer service is almost comical. These people honestly could care less. Granted they're all real young so I probably didn't give a \"care\" when I was their age but all of them? Where's the adult here? I ordered my food, they made it promptly. There are 9 people behind the counter that I was able to count. 2 people, myself included, eating. All of them are just kicking back chatting loudly about what song to play next. Cool. I didn't get a napkin with my food so I get up and stand there and wait to catch attention of one of them. Finally someone looks at me and I say where can I get a napkin? 2 of them continuing leaning back on the counter and point to where the napkins are BEHIND the counter. Uh ok? So I reach over to get some. I sit back down and 2 are behind me huddled together talking about how the manager is and how he doesn't like one of them. I feel like I'm at high school all over again. I do not recommend dining in. If you live close enough and want a JJ sandwich, just call."}
{"text":"It's been over an hour since I ordered my sandwich for delivery.  I'm 2 blocks from this location and I still have not received my order.  Called to ask where it was, was told to keep waiting and the would get someone to send it over.  If you are on any sort of time crunch for your lunch, do not go here."}
{"text":"Yes I am a fan. First time here was yesterday at lunch. There was no line, is suspect the reason for no line would be that they are SUPER fast. This place made me a 8\" Italian club on a fresh hoagie roll in less than 2 minutes for $5.00. Its a great deal, good ingredients and the lettuce is finley shredded (like any good hoagie place does). I will be back for sure with more people. They deliver too. So get that food delivered when you shouldn't drive but you are REALLY hungry."}
{"text":"I like their subs but every single time I come here they cannot seem to get my order correct. And God for bid I order it online and ask for anything extra, even when I pay extra, because it surely will never make it onto my sandwich."}
{"text":"Their bread is so delicious, and being the carb-conscious nut I am, it's difficult to not devour all the bread (I don't usually). I've been to Jimmy John's in Chicago, so these subs aren't new to me, but I love that it's close by the office. Their tiny space gives an urban feel atmosphere... and it's also open late-night for all the Mill Ave barcrawlers!  I usually order the Beach Club with turkey, provolone, avocado, lettuce, tomato and cucumber. While it's considered a \"Giant Club\" for which you're charged slightly more, it doesn't really feel giant to me. That's my only beef with the place, their regular sandwiches must be less filling in comparison... almost scared to try them! Best thing about JJ's is when I'm broke, I'm not above walking by for FREE SMELLS!"}
{"text":"So, I have to be really honest. My brother worked there and always mentioned that things were not run up to the fashion that someone should hope for. On 9/5/15, after working his driving shift, they didn't want to pay him or cash him out because of an issue with the manager. I shouldn't say that someone was right or wrong, but any job that I have ever worked, I would not be cool if someone in a position of power told me that I could not be paid for that day due to any issue.  The manager repeatedly displayed why he should not be in this position,  1. he left the line to call his boss to ask what to do, leaving some 20 customers who had already ordered or were eating in the store to be witness to this incident that should have been handled away from customers.  2.He took it upon himself to make a decision that an employee shouldn't be paid, even though the issue was over about three dollars, and he could've made it a lot less ugly. A customer disputed that they did not get correct change, and it was the difference of about three or four dollars. My brother wants to get the tips he had already made, and the manager felt it necessary to hold all of his money(about 40 or 50 dollars). It's important to note, that he had used his gas to deliver sandwhiches for the whole day, so the manager left him with no money, no gas and no forseeable way to get home. This is pretty upsetting but it gets worse. 3. While this manager was running around with his head cut off, he allowed an entire store of people empty out becuase obviously they did not want to witness a scene between employees that should be handled away from customers. I can't imagine how much business was lost and future business that was turned away becuase of an incident involving three dollars.  4. Becuase this manager took such a hardheaded approach to handling this situation and at no time supported and showed appreciation for his employee who clearly was frustrated, he allowed a situation to be created where he wanted to paint my brother out as this terrible person who make a scene. Is a person who is trying to get the money that they are owed so they can get home, a terrible person? Everyone would probably have their own opinion on this subject, and every customer who was there seemed to share their views with my brother. It is absolutely disgusting that due to an inexperienced or inept manager, that he would create a situation that was dangerous. Some customers told my brother he was absolutely justified in being upset and should be angrier and that they would do the same. Also some customers told my brother that they would fight him and got verbally aggressive with him if he would not leave. I can't express how much I am torn here, at any time the manager could've given my brother his money and told him leave so that the situation didn't escalate any further, but rather chose to let the situation become even more volatile. 5. He allowed my brother to followed to his car by an angry customer who clearly felt that this was a problem that he could solve. The man would not allow my brother to leave and ended breaking the handle of his car door before finally backing off. It seems important to mention that this customer was a normal human being who after witnessing what was happening in a restaurant, felt it necessary to follow someone to their car and tell them how they felt about it. 6. How could you let this happen over something so small and insignificant. I cannot express how furious I am with this establishment, and after my brother told me his side of it, I merely called the store several hours later to make a complaint verbally. I told the manager at the time, Devin, a girl who clearly already knew the story.  7. All I wanted was information on the manager's name and what if anyting they were going to do about getting my brother paid. I maybe spoke for about a minute, very politely, and she told me to hang on a sec, which I said sure. She then proceeded to hang up on me. When I called back several times, it appeared my call was screened. Absolutely unprofffessional and the only word that seems appropriate is childish. I don't know if Devin is super best friends with the manager working during the day or not, but when a customer calls a restaurant with a complaint, a manager shoud reassure the customer that the problem is being handled and apolgize and take responsibility even if you had nothing to do with it. I feel that dumping the customer complaint in the trash is the same as saying we don't care what you think of us. So, i made a a complaint with corporate JImmy Johns but I felt it necessary to highlight everything that has happened to prevent future customers from visiting this location, and prospective employees from applying there. It seems clear that a bunch of unprofessional children who were promoted \"freaky fast\" to their positions can not run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Delivered to my house  They were super fast and very pleasant when they arrived.  The order was correct and delicious ! Love their sandwiches.  They always use the freshest ingredients and the bread is great too. Love this place! Will order from there again!!!"}
{"text":"To compare Jimmy John's to Capriotti's would be a crime. Caps are in a class of their own.  To compare it to Subway would be hilarious because Subway's limp soggy sandwiches are ridiculous when compared to a Turkey Tom, a JJ Gargantuan, or a Beach Club, etc.  You know that you are getting a fantastic sub, with fantastic bread. fresh ingredients, at a clean restaurant, and it's prepared in short order. The way it should be.   This location in particular has plenty of seating, clean bathrooms, friendly staff and easy parking. Perfect for that \"after the gun club\" moment.   I'm a fan, and yes, I will go back."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a reluctant 4 stars.  i am a fan of JJ's. Every location that I have ever been to has served up quality sandwiches....and everyone who knows me, knows that I love a good sandwich.  This spot is no different. Great bread, meat and vegetables. Fresh, tasty and delightful.   The motto for the chain is \"Freaky Fast\". Usually, when I make my purchase, my sandwich is ready by the time I put the lid on my cup. This time around, I waited for several minutes.   There were no customers ahead of me. No new employees learning how to make sandwiches. Just very slow-paced employees.  I'm not upset or angry. It's just not the \"freaky fast\" service that the other locations have provided.   Not to worry. If I am in the area and want a sandwich, I will still come in.  JJ, you rock my world."}
{"text":"Nothing like a Jimmy John's opening up within a reasonable drive from your house. When I moved to Scottsdale about a year ago, I would make the drive to North Scottsdale (8-10 miles) just for a delicious sandwich.  Tonight, I had to feed the beast from within, and boy was he ragin'.  I popped into this Jimmy John's after finding it on their Web site (this review is also me creating the Yelp listing!).   The staff at this location is fast, friendly and everything that I have come to expect from Jimmy John's. My sandwich was done by the time I put the lid on my drink. Freaky fast!  Another big plus about this particular location (vs. others) is the type of ice they use. The machine dispenses pelletized ice. The kind that keeps your drink cold and perfect.  I almost always eat sandwiches. And when I do, Jimmy John's will always be one of my choices. Great work JJ!"}
{"text":"No meat, No cheese, No Bargain. $9 regular sandwich that is half the weight of their competitors. They said they had to make their portions smaller since they raised the minimum wage in Arizona. We'll see these stores closing down soon. Same portions at the Jimmy John's in Tempe near my work. The bread is good but at these prices, I can get a sandwich made at a bakery for half the price."}
{"text":"Seriously a life saver, ok maybe not a life saver but there are very few places that will deliver to my work. I downloaded their app which was made really well it's really easy and convenient. I have tried a couple different sandwiches and they have all been good, their pickles are amazing, and their chips are great too (I like the bbq). Every time I order they are very fast and always very nice. If you haven't tried them yet, you should, I get the sandwich before I get the confirmation email."}
{"text":"Great sandwich, sweet staff, love it plus fast service!!! Been there a few different times and always fast service !"}
{"text":"I LOVE JIMMY JOHN'S GOURMET SANDWICHES!!!! THEY ARE MY NEW FAVORITE!!!  My friend ALWAYS orders subs plain....meat and cheese... thats it!!  This place discounts it if you dont want a salad on your sub.  I love all kind of fixings on my subs, so Jimmy John's will please ANY sub craving!!! AND THEY DELIVER IN A 2 MILE RADIUS!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE JIMMY JOHNS!!!! FAST! YUMMY! CHEAP!!!!!        I usually get the turkey tom or the beach club... their bread is delicious and the signs on the wall are funny, if you have a few mins to stick around!!  They deliver if you live close, prob awesome for ASU students for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Great service! My order is always correct and the delivery people are always super nice and quick! I've never waited more than 10-15 minutes for my sandwich after ordering. Always a good experience with this jimmy johns !"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from this location several times. Delivery goes well but staff members CANNOT get any of my orders correct, EVER. Extras are rarely added though they are paid for. No mayo packets or napkins as requested. I will no longer be a customer at this location."}
{"text":"We just moved to Phoenix and was told that if you want a fresh sandwich try Jimmy John's. The staff was so great. Took there time in explaining the menu to us. I got the bacon lettuce and tomato on lettuce with a drink. I am sorry I didn't get all the staff members names but Vicki came over to our table to see if there was anything else we needed. Way to go Vicki and the team! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Way over priced for less than par meat and sub. I can pay the same and get an exponentially better sub. Avoid and wait an extra 10 mins for a better product!  $9 for a 6 inch ham, cheese and bacon sub ha no I am good!"}
{"text":"I was sad to see the spouts out of stock, but my order was perfect. Thank you for getting my order spot on! You made my boss's day."}
{"text":"Just finished my first sandwich from Jimmy John's. I'm visiting my parents and they ordered sandwiches too be delivered.  The delivery was quick and almost accurate. I ordered dijon mustard on mine and it didn't have any. It was still good. All in all I have to say it was a good experience and I would order from them again."}
{"text":"What makes this Jimmy John's great is the people that work there. Its a Jimmy Johns, it tastes good and is made and/or delivered outrageously fast. That's great, but the people here are very upbeat and pleasent. That sets them apart. Also I went in last night to pickup a online order and my girlfriend wanted to use the bathroom, the bathroom was flooded. No big deal, shit happens. The guy on the register gave us a free cookie just for the trouble. This is how you keep customers coming back folks! Thank you, you anonymous sandwhich wizards."}
{"text":"This is a Jimmy John's. The sandwiches are good and fast but the ordering experience I've had over the last year or two is very strange / weird at this particular location.  I've ordered from here maybe 7-10 times total. The first 4 or 5 times went off without a hitch, the other 3-4 times they refused to deliver because I'm outside of their radius all of a sudden?  I cant remember exactly but I know I placed a successful order in between all of this on accident forgetting about the incident months ago.    My house is 1.6 miles away. I drove there and timed myself. 4 minutes. I can jog there in 15 minutes. I can ride a bike there in 6 minutes. At my work I order from a Jimmy John's ALL THE TIME that is 1.7 miles away.   The most recent time I was informed their radius had increased recently. So.... how am I still excluded? And worst of all my dad and girlfriend have placed successful orders recently not knowing my experiences.   I get the radius, I mean a policy is a policy. But why all the inconsistency, why did you deliver sandwiches to my house to begin with? And why on earth did you call my house 5 minutes after placing an order to tell me that you wouldn't deliver my sandwich? That's bad customer service.   And worst of all they're completely unapologetic about rendering service before, and refusing to do so now. I even offered a $10 tip to the driver to go the extra 20 seconds or whatever I'm beyond the radius.   I just don't get it. I get the policy, I don't get the inconsistency. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's sandwiches are so good. I go to Subway all the time and they have nothing on JJ's. And yes they are ridicuously fast with your order. I actually drive almost 10 miles just to go get a sandwich from JJ's in Matthews. Give them a try and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So fast that by the time I paid it was already done! Fresh, fast, and a huge sandwich for the price! I highly recommend it for lunch!"}
{"text":"Jimmy John, along with High Roller Deli (not on Yelp) are probably the best 2 sandwich places to go in Las Vegas. Of course, I am referring to on the cheap and not places like Carnegie Deli inside the Mirage.   Service is fast (very fast) and the quality is high. I am a new customer and have only tried two sandwiches at the moment. Club Lulu and the \"Night something or other.\" Sorry the name eludes me. I highly recommend trying this sandwich shop out over Subways, over Quiznos and any of the others out there.  I am actually thinking about opening one of these up, not only here in Las Vegas, but out in Orange County when they are ready to do so. Looking for investors. :-)"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's has pretty good sandwiches, but nothing to write home about.  Their sandwiches are large though and the double meat ones will keep you full all day long.  They are super fast and super friendly, but c'mon, NO HONEY MUSTARD???  I know that's a petty thing, but I really need some honey mustard on my sandwiches.  They're chip selection is pretty meh as well."}
{"text":"We order from here all the time, one of the few places that delivers to our medical complex. They are always extremely fast, and the delivery drivers quite literally run the sandwiches from their car to our office. On the rare occasion a sandwich was sent with an error, the corrected order was sent in under 10 minutes. Keep up the great service, we appreciate you immensely!"}
{"text":"I actually like the taste of the food for the most part   ...it's just the customer service that is pretty 'hit or miss' and when it's bad it's down right terrible!   (As a 'for instance') I am really angry for the following reasons;  1: I pay the same price for a Beach Club UNWICH ($6.59) as I do for a regular Beach Club (photo attached)  (Beach Club = Turkey, Cheese, Bread, lettuce, tomato, avocado spread, cucumber, Mayo...way larger than the UNWICH...  UNWICH = NO BREAD so 1 (or 2 if you are lucky) lettuce leaves 'in place of' the bread, turkey, cheese, etc)  2: I can't have mayo (I am allergic to Eggs) & I don't like tomato, (and obviously we are minus the bread, I have a yeast allergy also!) SO tonight when I asked for them to go a little heavier on the avocado spread to compensate I was told I'd have to PAY 75c EXTRA!!!!!!!!   3:  The guy on the register was a smart ass about it. Not cool."}
{"text":"Workers are unhelpful poor excuses of corporate employees.  Jersey Mikes has more accommodating employees, better tasting subs, and much more consistency.  They claim to deliver but depending on how lazy the employees are they may or may not choose to.  Just go out of business already."}
{"text":"Winners worst service award!!!!!  Congrats!!!  Veterans Day holiday so everyplace was packed.   McDonalds packed, Peter Piper pizza packed with waits over 1 hour for the buffet.  My son was dying to eat something so walking through the parking lot we saw Jimmy John's.  EMPTY.   First clue right.  hahahahaha  Anyway I said screw it since I never been to Jimmy Johns before.   We go inside and my son wants a meatball sandwich.  They say.  Nope no meatball.   I mean WTF.   Who the fuck doesn't have a meatball sandwich.  Then he very smugly directs me to a ham sandwich and says they are practically the same thing.   I was thinking bro what fucking planet are you from?  They aren't even close.  I said fine just give me a roast beef and some other unmemorable sandwich.   He said do you want combos.  I said sure then it came out to over 20 bucks for 2 fucking combos.  I only had a 20 dollar bill on me.  I was like forget the combos.  Just give me the 2 sammys and water.  Boom over 15 bucks....    Yeah no joke for 2 small ass sammys.  I was thinking wtf am I in NYC or something.  This is a fast food chain.  Give me a break.   Oh wait it gets better.   So the sammys come flying out really fast.    Then when I open them up I understand why they are fast.   There is barely just meat, mayo and cheese on the sammys.  No wonder they are fast.  There isn't any toppings on the damn things.    So we sit down to enjoy our 15 dollar bare dry tasteless sammys, with 2 glasses of water.    I finally can't take it anymore and walk over to the worker and say can I get some Jalapenos to put on my sandwich.  He says no.  Then the manager comes over and says they can't give me sides because it is against corporate policy.    I said come on a couple of jalapenos nobody gives a shit.  She then says with a condescending attitude that corporate watches the cameras and she doesn't want to break policy.   I am not fucking joking.  Like corporate has better shit to do then to monitor cameras to see if a few jalapenos get snuck in on over priced fucking sandwiches.   I said what about that fresh ass tattoo that you got on your forearm that is dripping ooze all over the food?  Is that against corporate policy I say.  Of course she just blows me the fuck off and walks away.  Look this place is way beyond bullshit.   Needless to say I will never never never step foot in a Jimmy Johns the rest of my fucking life...    Fuck that whole chain."}
{"text":"Customer appreciation day, need I say more? Jimmy has always made a great sandwich that can be ready in a pinch. It always seems like someone is ordering Jimmy's in my office everyday. Like someone said before a nice change from subway."}
{"text":"I went there for the 1st time today. I decided to get the beach club sandwich. I was impressed by how fast I got my sandwich and the price is very reasonable. As far as the sandwich goes I'd say it was good but not amazing. I would be willing to go again but it wasn't as mind blowing as I had heard."}
{"text":"Love my number 2 sandwich!  Always GREAT service ! Give my best tips to these guys?!!  One very satisfied Customer!"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's claim to fame is being fast - and that they are. With that said, I most definitely prefer the slower Firehouse Subs. To me JJ subs are just plain subs that I can get at Subway, Blimpie, or Port. They are not bad subs and I really appreciate that they can hustle out dozens of orders in a few minutes, I just don't think that they are anything to write home about."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this location many times and have been delivered my orders with no problem.  This location is 3.1 miles away from me and is on the same street as me. I just called today to place an order and now they \"don't deliver to my area\" and \" it must have been a mistake\" last time. Uhhh I don't think so, it's happened more than one time and with different drivers. I guess no more Jimmy Johns for me"}
{"text":"I've lived in this area for 16 months now and have never stopped by until today. There was a grand opening next door that my other half and I were waiting to get into. Luckily they were open and he got a drink while I checked out the menu. I finally found something for me . We bought two sandwiches for dinner and we were not disappointed. There's only to types of bread but that french roll! Its not hard and tough and certainly not soft and mushy.  The combo meals were very filling, the pickles huge! The hubs has been dying for a salami sandwich for ages so he got the #9 and actually ate the whole thing. Usually he can only eat half and leave the rest to dry out and we toss it  out,but not this time. I only have one complaint with my veggie is it was a bit dry. The avocado spread was thin and one side and I was surprised that there was no vinagarette BUT I brought the take home menu and see you can ask for that. DOH! Go figure... So now I know to ask for it :)  Other than that I found the sandwich very tasty as well as being VERY satisfied with the bread. LOL. I actually had very little crumbs on myself. Proud moment to be sure :P Also, they only have two sizes of drinks which wouldn't be so bad if eat it there but a larger size would be better for take out/delivery. We are going to try the delivery soon and will be back for another sandwich really soon. They beat Subway hands down !"}
{"text":"I have such a love/hate with this place!  I ordered for delivery, to the tune of once a week, during really busy times at work.  The sandwiches are always yummy and I always have the same turkey sandwich, with the sporadic roast beef here and there.  I rarely eat bread but enjoy the rolls JJ's uses.  The ingredients are fresh and the prices are reasonable when you factor in the convenience factor.  So here's where the not-so-thrilled part comes in:  I have rarely gotten the right order when ordering online.  I got into the habit of checking the order WHILE the delivery person was still in the lobby.  Things got better after I chatted with the manager once or twice and he kindly refunded my money.  I now call in my order for pick up, and have discovered that the noise levels are so bad that the employee on the phone often cannot hear what I am saying. Another opportunity for error that can be easily contracted   The 3 stars is because of the slipups in service.  I suspect more stars can be easily earned by noise dampening and fewer mistakes.  I know I would order more of these yummy treats!"}
{"text":"IF YOU LOVE SUBWAY, KEEP GOING THERE. Sorry JJ's there is nothing about you that is better than Subway, nothing. The reason I graded with 3 stars is because feel bad that I don't have anything positive to say."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Called at 11:45 today to order 4 sandwiches. Staff was laughing and couldn't hear my order. Then they told me that they wanted to warn me that it was going to take a lot of time. I hung up and went to Jersey Mikes!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, decent price, fresh ingredients all a bonus.  Service by young kids/teenagers is hit and miss but as to be expected and its a quick ordering process so it's not that painstaking.    They are generous with the ingredients and will make it to order and I like that you can get it \"unwich\" without the bread, wrapped in lettuce, for the low carb enthusiasts out there.  $5.50 gets you a sandwich in record breaking time, made to order with fresh ingredients, oh and they deliver too."}
{"text":"Had a delivery brought to work I must say my coworker ordered sprouts I did not but they were all over my sandwich and i really wish i had the sandwich was Delish."}
{"text":"Fast amazing subs, and great customer service. Finally a Jimmy Johns that is close to me!!!"}
{"text":"I had hoped that Jimmy Johns would be a world-class sub shop but it isn't! Very disappointed because I again fell for the hype. Ordered a Turkey Tom (supposedly one of their signature subs). It was merely a thin slice of deli turkey with shredded lettuce, lots o' sprouts and a tired tomato slice with mayo. The bun was a flat, cardboard-tasting affair (homemade French, alors non.. more like yesterday's chemo-bread). If you wanted cheese, it was a cost addition. I asked for a plastic knife to cut it in quarters....not available. I asked for a paper plate for my kids...not available.  The staff was over exuberant but not over competent. (standard Subway crew with more shouting added.) I'd rate it about half as good as any local Subway shop and about 1/10th as good as Grum's in Cleveland Heights."}
{"text":"The food is great, but I have an issue with service every time I go there. I ordered a sandwich for pickup recently, and when I got there they said they didn't have it. I told her my name and she said \"is it for Bud?\" Bud was not what I said. Then they tried to make it seem like I was the idiot and said are you sure you ordered at this location? I was grabbing my phone to confirm and one kid said \"Oh, I made that sandwich! It's right here.\" He made my sandwich, started talking to his coworkers, and left it there not on the pickup shelf. No apology or anything, just here you go. I left there thinking \"how was that so hard?\""}
{"text":"One of the slowest jimmy johns I have ever ordered from, probably ordered 15 times the last two months and have had one under 45 min.. I'm only a mile away? Then when you call to ask the status they just say that it's on it's way without a care in the world of there freaky fast campaign.. The problem with the Arizona heat is that extra time to get delivered leave you a warm sandwich."}
{"text":"Rating specifically on sandwiches I would give the place a 4 star rating.  The bread is soft and the meat, cheese and veggies are fresh.  It's better than Subway for sure. The restaurant is clean and the service is good.  Buuut, they only have 1 booster chair for kids! One! Like for the whole place?!?! So that means when I come to lunch with my friend who also has a busy 1 year old, we get to rock, paper, scissors who has to deal with their child trying to escape out of the booth and jump up and down.  Sorry Jimmy Johns but I won't be coming back with friends until you can get a few more boosters and high chairs for us crazy moms who dare eat lunch with out kids in society."}
{"text":"I have ordered from these guys 50 plus times. Delivery. Now all of a sudden they can't deliver to my business 1.2 miles away? They said their delivery area does not exceed 1 mile. Why even have a delivery service if you can't go an extra .2 miles. Very disappointed. That can't be good for business. What's a great sandwich if you can't order one to your work 1.2 MILES AWAY???"}
{"text":"Stay away, dirty tables, loud music and enough mayo to chock a horse! Seems to me the only ones enjoying the place was the employees! Yelling back and forth like they were the only ones there. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Customer service is really bad! Not a smile in the place! Asked for the Italian vinergarette dressing on the side for my samdwich and they said they couldn't do that.  I wasn't going to eat for over an hour and didn't want it soggy! I asked to put it in a cup and said he couldn't do that either. But yet water cups are free??? Had to ask for a bag so I could carry out 3 sandwiches and 3 chips and had to get the bag myself over the counter!  Yep! It was soggy!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I eat at a 'chain' and wonder how it even got past the original restaurant. Jimmy Johns joins that list. Went today and got a number 11, which is off of the deluxe or some-such side of the menu, the hook being 'twice the meat' and so on. What I got, if twice anything, well, glad I did not get the regular. It was mostly a bread and lettuce sandwich. The french roll was good, but that was it. Really an unremarkable sandwich. I can't see ever going back. I don't even care that much for Port o Subs and Subway, but either of those is way better than this."}
{"text":"This is the 5th time that I've ordered jimmy johns from this location and it's taken over 30 minutes for them to deliver it... I'm not sure why it takes this long but today I didn't get all of my change back, the man walked away before giving the rest to me, my sandwich isn't made right either, I've eaten here before and it's been great but these past few times, horrible. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Sandwiches. My favorite food group. As a recent transplant into Las Vegas, I was briefed on Jimmy Johns (@jimmyjohns) on some friends with Indiana ties.  I popped in for a sandwich one day, and my life has never been the same. Yeah. It's a chain. Who cares. It's damn good. And it's VERY affordable. Most sandwiches are about $5. With better quality than the \"public transportation\" of sandwiches.  All the sandwiches are the same size. Order by number, which is great for the indecisive (like me).   My favorites here are the Beach Club, The Gargantuan and the Vito.  You can't go wrong. Also, if you like pickles, order one. It's a giant kosher, sliced to your perfection.  My only advice is to ask your sandwich person to cut the sandwich in half. You may want to take some home.  Lastly, you can also buy their day-old bread, which is equally amazing.   Go. Now. Please."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with the product at this location, it's the same as all Jimmy John's. However, the staff here is the worst I've encountered at any location. No 'hello' when you walk in, they don't even say anything when you get up to the register, they mumble at you, and basically just look at you like a chore. If you're downtown, get it delivered or go to another location."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich shop in the entire city! The sandwiches are very affordable some starting at around $3 while others cost no more than perhaps $8. My favorite aspect about this deli is that every time I had visited they were super quick! The sandwiches go through an 'assembly line' type format so you may never have to wait longer than 5 minutes for your sandwich (even when busy).The perfect place to go on a quick lunch break, and its even faster if you call in advance!"}
{"text":"I'm used to Jimmy John's because I order it a lot at work, sometimes I just don't have time to go lunch, so it's awesome that they deliver!! I usually order the Beach Club or Turkey Tom!....I have it cut in half and add extra tomatoes and sprouts.  ...I also ask for napkins because if u don't ASK you don't GET."}
{"text":"Good delivery, good service! Sandwiches are good. Always can count on them for a quick quality sub!"}
{"text":"Come for the bread but that's about it. Pretty basic it's for a sandwiches go, not a whole lot of options as far as toppings. Also, the scary warning about sprouts almost made me want to forgo toppings altogether. There wasn't any wait when we walked in, and it looked pretty clean as well. I would definitely pass this place up for something else next time."}
{"text":"The best of all the sandwich shops. Get the Gargantuan! Loaded with all good meats and cheeses and there are loads of add-ons to choose from. The Jimmy's hot peppers are wonderful. AND they deliver - even one sandwich! If you go in you will be very pleased with the friendly and fun staff. Try it - you'll love whatever sandwich you choose!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! When I got here there was one other customer waiting for a sub and most of the staff was sitting at a table in the front eating chicken nuggets. The two people that got up to help us were super rude and acted like we were a big inconvenience. After ordering our food we sat down and after 15 min another guy came in and order and sandwich and got his before we did. I got irritated and got up to ask them why my food wasn't ready and the girl just said we made hem out of order. And then told the other guy to make our food. When the food was done they didn't even call us to the counter. They put the two sandwiches on the counter and let hem sit there. The whole thing was just a bad experience. I won't ever go back to this jimmy johns and I would recommend no one else does either. Go to a different location."}
{"text":"Yummy Subway is a thing of the past for us.  Highly  recommended price is higher but you get  what you pay for"}
{"text":"If anyone rates this company above a one star there just downright I dont know. I have been to 3 jimmy johns, and all were horrible. I ordered a roast beef sandwich, it was like $8 no cheese 6 inches long and had one slice of roast beef are you F(**&*(&(*& ing kidding me tons of lettuce, and nothing else. the bill was like $24 fior a pickle two SO CALLED sandwiches, and 2 cookies . YOUR A FU*&(*&( joke jimmy johns. and I work near one, and I look for stuff like what the owners are driving and they are driving $100,000 Audis , Mercedes, its a racket they suck. I am going to open my own chain. I am sick of these racketeers milking the public its time for excellent value at a fair price. screw you Jimmy Johns, and all the competitors like you. Im going to show you how its done. I dont have to lavish . I would rather give the money back to my customers in value and my employees in a great wage. Capatilistic evil people"}
{"text":"Went in yesterday for lunch as I'm exploring new places around work. It wasn't difficult to see from the street, but their location is in an oddly designed plaza. The restaurant was only partly filled, just over half the tables were empty. The two employees behind the counter could tell I had never been in before, and they offered to suggest a sandwich based on the things I liked. I decided to play it safe for the first time out and got an Italian with bacon. I heard their commercials so I knew their bravado for speed, but I was wholly unprepared for them to prove it.  I turned from the register to fill my drink cup, and before I could finish getting ice, my order was ready.  The sandwich wasn't bad. The bacon was a bit soggy, but the bread was baguette-like, the meat was fresh, and the lettuce was crispy. Overall, it was a satisfying experience, and one I'm sure I'll have again."}
{"text":"Wen here because my wife was @ john c Lincoln hospital got my 6 y.o daughter the #9 told them to hold the hot peppers because my 6 y.o don't like um they put them on anyway & cashier was very rude"}
{"text":"Newly Opened Location with a GREAT staff who is working hard to be FREAKY FAST!!!! I would highly recommend this location given the cleanliness and quality of product!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Clean, great staff, friendly and professional. Sub was tasty, fresh bread, and prepared very FAST! Would definitely recommend. Will come back! Definitely a place to check out on the Eastside!!"}
{"text":"We walked into this restaurant for the very first time and all 3 workers just looked at us...no greeting what so ever so I said hi and they just looked at me.., one (Morgan)finally said hi and then just stood there looking at us... no May I help you ... silence. Whatever happened to greeting the customer? Obviously they don't about return customers. The restaurant smelled terrible the floors were nasty - try cleaning the floor with clean water...won't be back"}
{"text":"Lightning fast delivery! Friendly staff. I like this place. It's pretty clean too. By the time you hang up the phone, the sandwich is at your door!! Lol"}
{"text":"This Jimmy John's is the old standby for lunch when we can't think of anything and we don't have time for anything because we have to be back right on time for some douchebag's sleep-inducing 900 slide powerpoint presentation that rivals any kind of torture the Soviets came up with for extracting information from captured agents during the cold war. Basically it's just really convenient and close. Ordering is pretty quick and easy but the layout is weird and customers end up congregating near the soda machines to wait for their order. This makes for awkward squeezing through narrow pathways and excusing yourself so people waiting for their order to show up would GTFO of the way so you can get to the soda machines. The sandwiches are pretty standard for a chain - not writing home about them but not complaining about them either. They'll do in a pinch. Atmosphere - alternative rock usually blasts from the speakers around lunch time. Parking is ok for now but the parking lot layout is a bit mentally-challenged. They could have easily fit more parking - it'll be interesting to see what it's like when ALL the businesses in the same buiding are finally open. Right next to Smashburger and Shutterfly is building a spot a few paces east as well. Located right on the NW corner of S. Country Club Way and E. Elliot Road."}
{"text":"The food is good but I'm only giving them 3 stars because their delivery radius is really stupidly set up. I live at greenway and Bullard but they don't deliver here. I'm literally less than a mile away. Once they change that I'll give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"So what's the big deal about this place?? Well I was about to find out. By the time I placed and paid for my order I just took two quick steps to pick it up and BAM there was my sandwich! Woah freaked me out Jimmy J! No joke, that FAST!   Prices was super reasonable. Most are under five bucks for a sandwich.  Ordering is really easy. There is menu above the counter and for us losing our eyesight there is a HUGE menu on the wall you can easily read.  Sandwiches are divided by Subs and Clubs and numbered. And for the picky eaters like Mr. B who likes just meat and bread (no veggies & sauce) in their sandwiches they have Plain Slims,tell them you want Slim #1,2, etc. from the Sub side of the menu. Those sandwiches set you back  just $3.75.   The UNwiches - Love the fact you can get any of their sandwiches listed on the menu wrapped in lettuce.  The lettuce wrap was crisp, cold and held up my #3 Turkey Tom Unwich pretty well.   Ratio of bread/lettuce wrap meat, cheese, veggies and condiment was just right amount. Serving size for the 8\" orders we had were just enough for us. Quality and taste was pretty good. The turkey was pretty lean and so was the smoked ham meats in Mr. B's order. Everything was fresh and well chilled.  Minus Stars for:  no hot sandwiches...but then again that takes longer to make and then it wouldn't be freaky fast now would it?  ...and also they still list Alfalfa sprouts on their sandwiches but due to recall they no longer put them on. Pssst Jimmy J...get a black marker and black out the word \"Alfalfa Sprouts\" from your menu.   You can dine in. The place is small but they manage to squeeze in a bunch of booths that sit two people and there are high table and chairs in the back area.  Also outdoors shaded area with 2 sets of  patio table and chairs.    Service not only freaky fast but friendly as well.  Before we stepped in, one of the employees came out to let us know they had a bunch of soccer teams who cleaned them out of bread! They were baking some more and it would take another twenty minutes for it. No big deal, went and did some shopping at Target and came back...and the employee didn't charge us for drinks for the inconvenience. That was cool.   Happy to add JJ's as another go to lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Disappointing, AGAIN! Thought I'd give them another shot. FAIL! Missing item from order. Very frustrating when you pay for certain items ahead of time, including tip and then don't get the quality service you pre-tipped for and basically get your money stolen because you don't get everything you actually paid for. What a RIP OFF!"}
{"text":"This place is very welcoming, it's amazing how fast they truly are!!  Thank you to lovely for providing a great positive environment for the customer. You make us feel special every time! Please check this place out from the cleanliness to the customer service all 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"what more can i say, but that this has to be one of the best sandwiches i ever ate. i had the Turkey Tom and my friend had the Pepe. i dont know if it was the hangover talking, but i devoured that sandwich as if it was heaven on a plate. the ingredients are fresh and simple. no massive menu to have you standing there for days as the customers behind you tap there feet. just a few good items and you're golden. the wait staff is friendly, prices are reasonable, seriously what more can you ask for? in a city known for their buffets and fine dining, this will definitely be a regular pit stop when i come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Las Sendas is maybe a 3 minute drive from this location. How do you not deliver to a place that is so close. Was told their delivery ring is small for the area. What is it the size of the parking lot?"}
{"text":"I guess if they state in their name they are the best you will believe them. Not true. Good bread makes a sandwich and this bread does not. It is tasteless with a hard outer shell. Then the only sandwich shop I been to that charges extra for cheese so they can price point the sandwich to look like a better value. So, sorry to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I like to pick out my stuff for my sandwich, rather than have it 'pre-selected' on the board. The price for a sandwich is not competitive with their competitor and the choices are quite limited. The service was ok since we were the only ones in the place. They were out of or not serving sprouts. Two of our sandwiches came with sprouts so we asked what they'll substitute, answer, \"nothing\".  We were disappointed with the price and the lack of choices."}
{"text":"So I had my healthy turkey sub delivered to the outside patio of a restaurant that there wasn't anything healthy I could eat.   It felt like a just a couple of minutes later after I hung up the phone when I was startled by the bicycle delivery.  I was not prepared for it to arrive THAT fast. Now I get it. There are times when you just gotta have it.   I can not believe they deliver to the wee hours of the morning.  But then again, this is a college town.  You never know when your next craving might appear.  Cute fit delivery I wish we had a Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"I live less than 2 miles away total drive time 4 minutes yet I can't get delivery??  Same location delivered to a friends house 3 miles away. With a longer drive time. If I have to go pickup my sandwich, I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I ordered online.  I go to pick up my order, the place is empty except the 3 employees.  One is working and the other 2 are standing around.  I tell them I placed an online order.  They look stumped.  The start looking around for an order and find it on the printer.  One of them hop to it and start making my sandwich.  I placed the order online so I could just walk in pick up my order and go. Freaky fast my behind!"}
{"text":"I had to give them that extra star!!!!  This place ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I stopped in today for lunch and lucky for me it was customer appreciation day! So subs were literally $1!!! I'm not kidding, that is not a typo they were selling the subs for $1!!!  I tried the # 5 Vito which is the original Italian sub with genoa salami, provolone, capicola, onion, lettuce, tomato & a real tasty Italian vinaigrette. For an added kick they put on HOT peppers which for this sandwich are a definite MUST HAVE!!!!  The service just like their motto was fast and efficient, my sub was on delicious freshly baked bread and the Italian vinaigrette dressing and hot peppers really made the sandwich great!  I look forward to going back....I would have added a picture but this sandwich was so good...I just couldn't help myself!"}
{"text":"Gourmet?  The sandwich is better than Subway, but not the best sub I have had.  Pretty ordinary, nothing special.  It appears as if they do a lot of take out."}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas and we originally ordered from Capriottis on Warm Springs and Eastern but they constantly run out of roast beef and don't tell you until you are ready to pickup your order.  Again disappointed by this specific Capriottis we cancelled our order and went to JJs.    The sandwich establishments are in different classes but JJs is reliable.    I would have rated this review a 5 star but when we asked for the sandwiches to go the guy behind the counter pointed at the bags behind the countered and was weird about bagging them and made us do it."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I didn't get what all the hype is about.  It's good, better than Subway, but that's not saying much.  At least their open late, and on Sundays."}
{"text":"I actually never have been inside this stores location but, going off of the 40 deliveries I've received, they have a 95% success rate with  correctness of order and delivery time.. They also have cured many hangovers, so thank you for having the fastest most reliable delivery ever  I tip my hat to you, jimmy! ;)"}
{"text":"Decent service and amazing food. I like my sandwich a particular way and they never get it wrong. My favorite sub place. Also the service is lightning fast."}
{"text":"They aren't joking when they say freaky fast and freaky good!  I came here to grab a quick sandwich to bring with me on my flight to Croatia because I'm not a fan of airplane food.  I ordered my usual vegetarian with no mayo and add sprouts, it's my fav and I get it every time.  Anyways, they are so fast I was in and out in like a minute!  The wheat bread was nice and soft and the veggies were crisp and fresh.  I will definitely come back here when I have a craving for JJ!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, I really do. But, they have yet to get a single order correct. Still good sandwiches, but not what I order. Wrote in to the customer service e-mail twice and they could not bother themselves with even a simple acknowledgment that they got it... Just really really bad customer care..."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Jimmy John's.  #5 Vito with Thinny Chips and a medium soda. $8. Service is good. It's fast food but better, in my opinion.   I like their bread. The place is clean. The people are nice.  There really isn't too much to say."}
{"text":"The only reason they dont get 5 stars is because the meat and stuff slides around in the sandwich too much while you are eating it. Now I know that happens in most sandwiches. But  If they could find some way to remedy that I would give them the fifth star all day. The French bread they put their fix ins in must have a little crack cocain baked into it cuz I just can't get enough. I always do the country club. When I got some real hunger issues I'll rock the he'll out of the J.J. Gargantuan. Please Believe!"}
{"text":"Bland and boring, but sometimes that's what you want.  The bread here is supposed to be baked fresh, but I've had it be hard and stale before.  The signs advertising \"free smells\" are kind of useless- there is nothing inside baking or cooking to smell good.   Choice of bread is a french bread, a multi-grain (which is actually higher in calories) and lettuce-wrap type deal.  Cheese does not come standard on the sandwiches unless specifically indicated- otherwise it is an upcharge, which seems slighty ridiculous.  The choices are limited- no grilled chicken, for instance.  You can upgrade to a meal by adding chips and a drink.  Beware, even the \"Thinny Chips\" pack 260 calories (the website says 130, but that's for a serving.  The bag contains 260 calories worth- who eats 1/2 of an individual serving of chips). On the plus side, it is super quick and the people are polite and friendly. They deliver, too."}
{"text":"I travel a lot, so I notice variations in restaurants with a lot of locations.  I have been to this JJ's twice, and both times it was five stars all the way!  The place is clean, the people are great, and the service is wicked fast.  This is a definite winner!"}
{"text":"Stay Away!  Horrible customer service (in store)!  Rude cashier and front staff.  The MANAGER of all people  was Rude and Terrible Customer Service Skills."}
{"text":"I had such a bad experience tonight and was very disappointed! I've been to all of the jimmy Johns locations in champaign and even been to the one in Tuscola and charleston and I've NEVER had bad service till this evening! This store was very disappointing..from not being greeted at the door (like every other jimmy Johns location) to HORRIBLE customer service! I think the food is amazing and I've always been in such awe of how great the customer service is! Even when I get it delivered I have amazing customer service but this store was terrible! I don't recommend this location to anyone! It was 530pm so maybe it was just the group working but it was very upsetting to have such a favorite restaurant of mine to be ran by such rude individuals!"}
{"text":"Very reliable when bringing your extras for delivery. The drives I have had seem to all be great also."}
{"text":"I buy sandwiches from this location frequently.  I think the folks working there are nice and friendly.  I do always order and pay for extra of the hot peppers, but they rarely add extra peppers.  Lose one star for that.  I do love the Vito sandwich."}
{"text":"Key Issues:  - Very Bad Customer Service - Sell of old/dated & bad product (knowingly) - Dishonest - Misrepresentation of Corporate Standards - Insulting, Rude - Re-occurring issue (not the first time)  I was previously on Yelp before and ate at this Jimmy John's so I lost my previous review from when the store first opened (it was a 3 star review) which i wanted to do lower (2 stars) but the store was new so I compromised a bit. For my first experience, I was told they were out of bread and to come back in 5 minutes. I waited 10 minutes and then came back; they said give us about 3 minutes.\" I waited 12 minutes more and then came back, they began to tell me sorry to wait longer but then paused, and said \"oh we got bread now.\" Mind you I was patient, respectful and understanding (they were uncourteous and rood.) So I went to get my sandwich and then was very surprised to notice brown bread that was very very hard, crumbled when bit into and far from fresh - (that pause I assume was someone saying just give out the old dated stuff) So for that experience, due to the rude treatment, uncourteous behavior and willful serving of old product not to be given to customers, I did a 3 star review.  *Note - at the time I was Yelp Elite and and took the review serious so I really wish I had my old profile and could leave this low review with more notoriety.  Anyway - this most recent experience; my wife ordered Jimmy John's delivery from here. No. 1, no cheese, bbq chips, and a soda ($9 meal). Sandwich arrived timely, tipped $3, making for a $12 sandwich.  Upon opening the wrapper, bread looked brownish, and was nearly too hard to bite into; I don't mean hard like Panera French Bread (Panera's a good firm exterior with soft moist center) I mean no moisture, flaking and crusty hard with a turned taste. I thought JJ's had French too...  My wife decided to go up there (my experience there when it first opened pushed beyond the limit of \"we'll let it slide\", I mean we like Jimmy John's). When my wife walked in, an employee said \"would you like a manager\". This caught her off guard because why would that be assumed.  Manager appeared; situation was explained and bread was shown. He left and re-appeared with a business card and then explained they have new bread, called it artesian (not sure if JJ Corporate knows about their new bread or not. In the back new sandwiches were being made with fresh yellow looking bread (must of been the previous type of JJ's bread that my wife wanted?).   So the manager offered a new sandwich to be made; my wife said, \"sir, if this hard bread is your new bread, why would I want the same thing?\" He said well what do you want; my wife said \"I have the chips and drink at home, just reimburse the cost of the sandwich.\" So he **pulls out his own wallet** and very animatedly and sarcastically pulls out a $10 bill.  This was an insulting experience, with willful and conscious rendering of bad product to a customer, all the while maintaining very poor attitude, and even being dishonest to the customer and assuming ignorance, as if we happen to miss the promotion for new artesian bread by JJ's. If this was a first time, I'd be more lenient; it seems now to be often enough to prevent our return and leave this lengthy, unfavorable review.  Here is everything that this experience wasn't: www.jimmyjohns.com/company/ (basically, the experience wasn't what JJ Corporate says you'll encounter and what they stand for) @JimmyJohns   We love Jimmy John's and will just have to grieve the lost of our epicurean relationship.  Very very disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything is always great but they forgot or ran out of sprouts for my  beach club when I had it delivered."}
{"text":"Subs so slow you'll starve before they get there. This location in particular is literally only two right turns right down Mineral Point Road (less than a mile on the same street!) to my workplace, yet it is always an average of 40 minutes before I get my delivery order. How is that even possible? I could walk there faster than that. I always have to remember to order my lunch well before I'm even hungry for it. If my work was in a weird location, I guess I could understand, but we're literally right down the street from them.   I love that JJ has online ordering but this location has to step up their game. Their \"Subs so fast you'll freak\" motto is a joke. If I could give this location less than one star, I would."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the catering order I placed for my work. It was ready and waiting when I arrived and their wonderful and friendly staff helped me load it into my car. There were no mistakes in my huge order, which has not always been the case at 3 of the 4 other places we've ordered same large amounts.  Sandwiches were delicious as were the cookies. My co-workers were happy! I only wish the online descriptions were better because I was nervous there would be enough sandwiches for our staff once I set up the food.  I would have liked to know that \"15-30 pieces\" of the sandwich platters were 3-4\" long sandwiches, not 5-6\". It makes a difference on how much to order to feed a large party of people."}
{"text":"Terrible delivery service. I love JJs, always have, but their \"freaky fast\" does not apply if you order online delivery from Main St. This is not the first time it has taken a long time but it was the longest delivery time taking an hour to get to me even though I'm a 10 minute drive from the establishment (at 4:20 on a Monday). All of my orders were made on different days of the week at different times, all took over 45 minutes to be delivered to me with no remorse from the people delivering them. Not one acknowledgment. I've worked in the food industry and I've worked in delivery and I am in no way tolerating the lack of acknowledgment of tardiness from the delivery persons. The sandwich was great to every requested detail, however, my advice when ordering online delivery is to give the tip, in cash, when they arrive. Otherwise, delivery time is not an issue to these JJs drivers."}
{"text":"What can I say?  I'm a Turkey Tom lover. This sandwich use to come with cucumbers.  Their menu changed a bit and the cucumber was removed on the Turkey Tom.  So make sure to add them back. It makes the sandwich perfect. Their bread is hands down superior when comparing to other sandwich places. Crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Yum. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"We went for the first time and were extremely pleased. The 2 gentlemen employees were very pleasant and friendly. Our sandwiches were ready freaky fast and we took them home and enjoyed every bite! We will return soon!"}
{"text":"1. Perfect bread 2. Great unique Menu 3. Super fast service with quality food. 4. Great filling  My favorite subs are the Beach Club and CLUB LULU!   Try this place you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This location is the worst I e I have ever been to. I just went through the drive thru and they got my order wrong. Not only five have to write my order correctly on the ticket, they are lazy and instead of making a brand new sandwich they just picked off the tomatoes off my sandwich and left gooeyness/ seeds still on there. If I wanted the tomatoes picked off I would have done it myself. This is not the only time I've had them to fix my order. They truly have lost my business indefinitely. Will definitely not order my daughter's party food here!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, fast service and the ppl at counter were super friendly. That's not the case at all Jimmy Johns. This one also has a drive thru.   You can order online. They are so quick with he orders the average time is about 10 mins or less for two sandwiches."}
{"text":"I usually love Jimmy Johns but today was not good. It was the bacon. It was all fat and really hard to eat. No crisp at all. I added a star  bc it was prepared quickly (I ordered online) and the counter girl was so nice."}
{"text":"I went here on lunch and the staff was very friendly  and the food was prepared fresh and delicious! One team member I noticed named Jesse was very polite and seemed like she enjoyed working there alot! She was also very helpful. I will definitely go to this location again!"}
{"text":"What a disappointing service experience. We ordered food and drinks to be delivered to our office for 12 people.  Food got here but they forgot the drinks.  They were trying to locate our drinks and after waiting for over an hour, our drinks were delivered.  It was bad enough that we had to wait over an hour after we received our order, but when the delivery person asked for a tip and we declined, he copped an even bigger attitude.   There are plenty of options in our area and if we order again we will pick up our own order."}
{"text":"Great place to get a quick bite on the run. I usually get their Vito sandwich which is their version of Italian with Genoa salami, capicola, provolone, lettuce, tomato, onions & vinaigrette. $4.95 for 8\" sub isn't a bad deal, specially with fresh ingredients. Give it a try.   Overall (4/5)"}
{"text":"I have become quite the sandwich connoisseur over the years, and thus know that not all sandwiches can be judged on the same scale.  There are tasty sandwiches and gourmet sandwiches.  Jimmy John's Tasty Sandwiches are exactly what they claim and a bit more.    The newest Tempe location is on the southwest corner of Rural and Baseline in the Whole Foods shopping center.  The service was fast and friendly and best of all they deliver....UNTIL 3AM!   I ordered the Vegetarian Club (#6), and it was pretty tasty.  Not gourmet, but kinda like home cooked goodness that fills the tummy and soothes the soul.  I was super ecstatic that they even offered alfalfa sprouts! I will definitely return to try some of the signature sandwiches now that I know they can handle the basics."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, but I placed my order for pickup and was there to pick it up, there was no parking so I called and asked them to change it to delivery right out front, and the person said no asked his supervisor and they said no. so you cannot deliver out front, thank you for your wonderful customer service and missing an easy delivery tip."}
{"text":"Food was fine but took an hour to get to me.  So much for their radio ads about fast delivery."}
{"text":"Been here twice in September 2013. Tried two of their subs, my favorite was the Gargantuan. The place looked clean top to bottom.  Service was fast, but there were only a couple customers inside, the other one was already eating. The staff seemed more interested in socializing amongst themselves. I thought it a bit odd that despite ordering my two subs 'to go', the sandwich maker dropped them on the counter and walked away. When I asked for a bag he nodded to help myself to one over the counter. He seemed more interested in chatting with coworkers than finishing my order, literally walking away to let me bag my own carry-out order.  Poor supervision I guess, maybe an employee brain fart, I have no idea. Maybe they only get one carry out order a day and just aren't used to it.  My food was good either way. But read on...  Follow-up: I wrote corporate about the bagging thing, their answer was essentially: help myself to bags, the employees are to be focused on getting the food to the counter as fast as possible, after that, I'm on my own. Bag my own order...   The only thing I find wrong with this attitude is when I am clearly the only customer there. No other food is being prepared, and the employees are talking and kidding amongst themselves, they will not bag your to-go order. I think that is somewhat disrespectful, but still not a major sin. I think if their focus was on customer service AND being fast then stuffing food in a bag would be both faster and better service. After all, who gains what by having three employees standing by watch me stuff my food into bags?  To my knowledge this is the only fast food chain that will NOT bag your carry out order. Right next door is Five Guys. I think I'll go there next time to see if they are more focused on customer service. Due to their poor customer service corporate policy, I'm gonna knock them down a couple stars.  I'd give them one star for service and three stars for food. The music was way too loud too. Considering how far I drive to get here I doubt I'll go back due to the poor service and poor overall experience."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches as I expect from Jimmy Johns.  Seems like a new staff so my sandwiches were ready in 60 seconds not the usual 30 seconds.  Still way faster than any other sandwich shop. But even though they were slower than usual for Jimmy Johns, the quality was still excellent.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"I stopped coming to this location after seeing employees put gloves on to prepare food without first washing their hands. It's nasty and it occurred on two separate visits at this location."}
{"text":"Good food as always with any jimmy johns... However this one has a history of being extremely slow with delivery. Took 45 mins to get my sandwich this time... So disappointing because they claim to be freaky fast... Guess thats only in the store!"}
{"text":"Tasteless. Not going to go back unless I'm forced. The service wasn't bad, but the food was not good."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm surprised to read some of the bad reviews! I guess I am biased, because I ate so much JJ's in college 20 yrs ago. For me the bread is great, toppings have always been plentiful, and I really haven't had any issues to speak of.   However, I could understand the \"JJ's business model\" might be off-putting for some. This is a college/young sub shop. If you don't know what you want you probably feel pressured and may even get run over. It does seem everyone is in a hurry here and curt. So, this is not the best place for somebody looking for a quite lunch and a chat with \"Sam the sandwich maker\" behind the counter.  We also habitually get the Beach Club hence we are never surprised, it's always great to us. I have had most sandwiches on the menu - all are good.  Also, yes you can save a buck & get a bigger sandwich at other places but, for us this is a quality stop once a month for lunch!"}
{"text":"I've tried other Jimmy Johns, and this one seems better than the last one I tried.  I had the Ultimate Porker, and it was delicious.  Lots of meat and mayo.  Other sandwich places skimp on the mayo.   I'd have try more sandwiches to give a higher rating.  The last JJs I went to was a nightmare during lunch.  I haven't tried this one then."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is what a basic standard sandwich should taste like. It's better than subway and Quiznos but there are better places out there and the food is kind of bland."}
{"text":"Addicted to the BLT but on wheat. Next will try the unwich. Always super scrumptious and love the pickles! Nom! Nom! Nom! Not sharing. :0)"}
{"text":"I tried to order $40 worth of food.  On line did not have a cash option.    So I called the store.  I was placed on hold for 8 minutes.   The gentleman was short and rude.   I hung up and called back.  He was agitated I bothered him again.  I expressently asked if they took cash.  My order was $41 dollars.     The delivery driver came and would not take a $50 dollar bill.  Called and asked for manager.  He laughed at my questions, wouldn't give me a number to call.  I asked for a regional managers name.   He gave me the name of a male porn star.   The news and yelp have been contacted."}
{"text":"Just ordered on line from CA for my grad student in Cleveland Hts.  By the time I sent the order in and got text message to him that his food was on the way -- I got the picture his \"ultimate porker\" had been delivered!  These guys are on top of it -- worked so well I thought I'd share 5 star service!  Remember to tip them, I did!  Thanks Jimmy J's for helping a hungry student -- full stomach better final prep!"}
{"text":"It took me a couple of tries to get used to it but now I am hooked! JJ's is a fantastic alternative to Subway. I give it 4 stars --with the realization it is fast food. Great, tasty, quick sandwich!"}
{"text":"I ordered online and picked up in the store. The food honestly was five star. The cranky brat behind the counter is why I lowered it to three. I get it. This isn't your passion in life, but I don't need your sass. I came in and the second I said I was picking up she was...mad about it? I'm not sure, I thought it would be easier to order online.  Great food mediocre service."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! By the time you order and pay, your sandwich is ready!  Funny humor throughout the restaurant makes it a more enjoyable experience!   The food is excellent, service is excellent and prices are great!"}
{"text":"Subs were pretty good. Not as good as Firehouse, but so much better then Subway or Quiznos. Each sandwich shop has their own unique taste. This is theres. Tasty bread. Could use more meat. A little too much mayo and lettuce, but I like alot of lettuce, and I'll just ask for might mayo next visit.   I called for delivery and it was at my door within 11 minutes. Cant say any pizza joint can pull that."}
{"text":"Stopped here today as I forgot to bring my lunch to work. I used to always go to the Settler's Ridge location when I worked in Robinson, so I figured I'd give this one a shot. There was literally 3 people here besides me which was great. I got my sandwich fast, and it was exactly how I remembered: fresh bread, fresh meat, fresh veggies. A million times better than Subway and very convenient. Staff was fine, so not sure what the other review was about. I'd suggest this location if you're in the mood for Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"Very fast service probably because they don't have to put much on a sandwich. There was no turkey. Felt like the 80's commercial \"where's the beef\". The bread was hard."}
{"text":"Have you ever gone to a sandwich shop that won't give you anything on the side with your sandwich?  Well then visit the JJ here on 15425 Scottsdale rd by Kierland ,and when you want your hot peppers or vinegar, or anything else on the side you just won't get  it here.    What kind of Cheap JA owns this place. Also owns one on Pima and Raintree. Same thing there Wont give you anything on the side. LOL"}
{"text":"So I'm dining in with my girlfriend enjoying our sandwiches when I look behind the counter and I see an employee cleaning the AC vents with a duster. I see two problems with this. one the store is still open for business and two the cold cuts were not covered and below the AC vents that the employee was cleaning. Where did he think the dirt is going to go.  what was that employee  thinking.  obviously he wasn't. I don't know how often this happens but I'm going to have to think about this the next time I need a sandwich."}
{"text":"The #10 Hunters club(Roast Beef) was disappointing. The menu indicates  \" Medium rare roast beef\" but it was more well done and no red or pink at all!  I love roast beef but in all 3 Jimmy Johns I have visited they have FAILED to live up to what is stated on the menu....I will now give up ordering RB in the future and try something else. Service was fast."}
{"text":"Roast Beef sub was awful!  Meat was well done, not the medium rare advertised on the menu.  Unfortunately I ordered it to go so I couldn't return it.  Tons of employees mulling around behind the counter-you would think they could use one of the people for quality control.  I know this is a new location but I would hope the corporate folks at JJ help this place out-  I have visited many other locations (Tempe and Las Vegas) and the subs are much better there.   It would also be nice if they would standardize and cut the sandwich in half...."}
{"text":"Went in for a sub. Turned away because they \"ran out of bread.\" What a joke of an establishment."}
{"text":"What a great sub Jimmy John's makes! By far the best I've found since moving from the East Coast. Unfortunately, this particular JJ's is having a hard time living up to the \"Subs So Fast You'll Freak\" slogan.  In my opinion, 40-mins to deliver is not fast considering we are about 6-mins away. And this has been the norm for the past few weeks. Yes, at one time they were fast... like 10-15 mins on average. But now.... fuggedaboutit! I've spoken to the manager - Chris - twice about this. But alas... our subs took 42-mins again today.   Outside of that; JJ's subs are fantastic! Packed with ingredients, a great quality bread, and the subs are consistently good. If you go into the shop, it's a well-oiled machine. And there's always an employee sweeping or washing something.  Overall, if you're hungry right now, I'd suggest driving to the shop. Otherwise, if you choose delivery, you might still be hungry in 40-mins."}
{"text":"Not much to say here, but the cashier was kind of dopey, not knowing the menu and the freebies you can add. Otherwise, just played it safe with a veggie sandwich and a few adds. The bread is usually the highlight at this chain."}
{"text":"I ordered three subs to be delivered the other day. The delivery time was pretty speedy, but the delivery driver was less than enthusiastic. The subs tasted okay, but they weren't worth what was paid, which was equal to a dollar an inch. And that's the base price, no add-ons or anything extra. All in all, I'll probably order again. I'm a sucker for a good sub, it's just too bad they're over priced or I would order from them more often."}
{"text":"A great All-American sub sandwich place. The ingredients always taste fresh, and the bread is always soft. The service is always really friendly and they always make the sandwiches very quickly, which I appreciate. However, I am giving them four stars because on more than one occasion they have asked me if I wanted to add cheese to my order and I said yes, they charge me and then I get the sandwich and there is no cheese. Other than that I always have a great experience."}
{"text":"So freaking cold inside couldn't even sit down to enjoy my food. My family and I had to leave and eat in the car because it was too freaking cold. Beyond what the normal standard should be."}
{"text":"So, if you look at their website on the menu tab...the sandwich looks nothing like the one that you will receive. Okay, I get that. Pretty photo on the website, slapped together sandwich when you pay for it.  The Jimmy John's by my house is at the most 2 miles away.. We share the same zip code. However, when I type in my zip code for their delivery, a message pops up that they do not currently deliver there...  Uh kay.  Walking in, it's three boys that look like they still belong in high school. I've interrupted their joking session, because the restaurant was empty. And I know I'm not some smoking hot 16 year old....so my presence isn't very welcomed.   I place my order. My sandwich, I get a #5 vito. I ask them to put mayo on it, because the first few times I got it, it's dry. Add hot peppers and take off the tomatoes. I then order two more subs, that ends up around $18.  I put $2 in their tip jar. Waiting for my food didn't take long. One of the boys asked me if I wanted a bag.......   For three sandwiches, yes, I want a bag.  He plops the three sandwiches on the counter, along with my receipt, and a bag, he says, \"here ya go\". and goes about his business.   OKAY, really? Capriotti's puts sandwiches in a bag. Hell, EVEN Subway puts sandwiches in a bag.  But I guess that's my responsibility. Cool, I'll remember that next time before I leave you all a tip."}
{"text":"We live in Hudson, 3 miles down the road.  We called to order 8 subs for delivery and they said we were 1/2 mile too far for them to deliver.   REALLY?  Did I just type that review....Really???  Yes I did, Really, I just did.   So i had to leave my house to get subs for my kids sleepover, lucky for me Daves Cosmic Subs was still open.   Funny thing is, Daves is 1/2 mile further away than Jimmy Johns for me.  1/2 mile......"}
{"text":"Well as you can tell from my 200 reviews, I almost always give 4-5 stars and this is the third 1 I have ever given....   We drove to jimmy johns and I ordered a beach club with mustard and it comes with avocado spread. He put a dime sized drop of each in the middle of the sub. My dad ordered a tuna sub with added onion and tomato. They didn't put either on it. We didn't notice until we drove 6 miles home...   My dad called back to complain and while he was a little bit frustrated and rude the managers response was you don't have to be a smart a$ about it just drive back and get another if you need to...  Really bad service and mediocre subs. I won't be back and urge anyone else to go to firehouse or which wich instead. Or jersey mikes all within a couple miles of here... Or even just go to Harris teeter"}
{"text":"First time we came to Jimmy John's the food was great place is clean nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"No tomatoes? Sorry about your luck, bro? Good thing that I ordered through their drive-thru and sat in line only to find out 10 minutes later they were out of tomatoes. Will you take it without tomatoes? No, I won't. The best part was that they sent me to another store that was already closed. Thanks for nothing but lost time."}
{"text":"I really need to stop coming to this location. Service sucks. I usually add the free hot peppers onto my \"italian nite club.\" One day I forgot to ask for it so I asked them afterwards and they said they can't give it to me on the side because I didn't ask for it during the order. Haha."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the delivery. I ordered online at 11:35 didn't get my sandwich until 12:25. I called twice and was told the delivery driver would be there in 5 minute. I literally work 2 blocks from JJ I just couldn't leave work today. I did call to make a complaint and the manager stated she voided my payment and gave me a $10 credit for next time. I've never had bad service at this location I just will make sure I never get delivery again."}
{"text":"I give them no stars when I went to get my sandwich it was made incorrectly so I had to go back and have them remake it and they did we make it but they made it in correctly again I did get my money back the first time I only had a 30 minute break and they ruined it they tried saying the way I ordered it the first time with sprouts I should have been more clear as far as no lettuce I've never been to a Jimmy John's where I had to say no lettuce if I wanted sprouts I always add red peppers there were red peppers on there that time but the second time there wasn't so freaking annoying I'm sure Jimmy John's doesn't care but I'll never go back there again I've been there twice first time it smells like butthole and this time they act like buttholes they didn't give a damn about my poorly made sandwich and that I only had 30 minutes and 10 minutes to eat because of them"}
{"text":"I love this sandwich franchise especially this location. Their app is awesome and I live down the road. The delivery guys are always really friendly and my food comes really fast. I've dined in and I had NO problems as well. I love this spot. Try the beach club or porker"}
{"text":"What the hell is wrong with this frugal chain. Last time I was here was only about six months ago and the sandwiches were about $1.50 cheaper. I usually could get a turkey sandwich for well under 5 bucks. Now, all of those sandwiches are $5.99 and none include cheese. Speaking of cheese, they only offer one flavor of cheese and it's flavorless. Now, my biggest issue with JJ is they refuse to provide salt and pepper. NO SALT AND PEPPER on your sandwich or on the tables. This is a real thing and thousands have boycotted the chain due to this fiasco and now I have joined that movement. Do you know why they deliver fast also? The delivery radius is only 1.5 miles. Oh yeah and they hide the napkins in the back, which is well known, but still annoying. Don't worry, I helped myself to a large trove of napkins to quell my lack of pepper on my final JJ sandwich."}
{"text":"Great service, super fast. The owner was there when I went in and took the time to make sure I had a good experience and a good sandwich.  Will go here every time we come through Summerlin."}
{"text":"Food is average but service has been very good each time we've been in here - contrary to their competitor across the street - jersey mikes."}
{"text":"They don't even deserve one star!  I ordered lunch to be delivered (sandwiches, pickles, and chips) for four coworkers . The sandwiches were the only items delivered.  When I called I was told it would be 30 minutes to get the rest of my order to me!  Ridiculous!  Lunch is over at that point!  Totally ruined our lunch and my desire to ever have Jimmy Johns again!!"}
{"text":"My go-to order is the Veggie Unwich, light mayo and as much sprouts as they can pack in there. I only grab to go, but my sando is ready super-fast and it's always perfectly rolled- some places offer lettuce wraps out of social obligation, and do a crappy job. JJ isn't one of them; it's always flawless and never falls apart.  There's a tip on the app page about how this location is \"tiny\"-- I'm guessing it's posted by a drive-by \"customer\" because it looks small on the outside but when you go in, there are 10+ tables and two massive group tables. It's not small.  The location has dark tinted windows (to save us from the cruel Vegas summer sun!) so it can look like it's closed during the day- but it's open! Line moves fast, veggies are always fresh, staff is efficient, prices are good and portions are big. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"I have been ordering delivery from this location since I moved to Tempe 3 years ago. Never once have I had a bad experience, or a rude encounter by staff. Everyone is always friendly and efficient and of course the unwhich is always on point!"}
{"text":"We love Jimmy Johns and are so excited they are finally expanding. That being said, we love this location on Mill. They are open till 4am on Friday nights so we typically hit em up either coming or going from the casino. Walking along mill and going into the shops is fun, there are a lot of restaurants we like but JJ is fast & cheap! The bread is delicious & I love the vinaigrette they put on their sandwiches. Thanks JJ for opening this location!"}
{"text":"Had the gargantuan, like always delicious and service was good. No complaints.   Recommendations.  I usually get the #5, #9, or gargantuan. Don't forget the hot peppers!"}
{"text":"I go to jimmy john's sometimes and it's always fresh and really good sand which. The only thing I hate about jimmy johns is they don't put mustard on their sandwiches. I asked for mustard and they told me they have packets then I asked if they could just put it on the sandwhich and he said no he couldn't. So I guess I have to go home open the sand which and then proceed to tear each bag open. I also asked the cut the sand which in two and they told me they have the knives over at the counter. I don't know I love the sandwhich's just wish the customer service was a bit better... like really ? You have one job."}
{"text":"Spot on! I went to EIU (home of store #1) when there was only one Jimmy's John's in the world - so I know when a franchise gets it right. Jimmy would give this one an A+."}
{"text":"Drivethru big plus !!! Delivery from the the phone or online. Also a plus!! If you in it's very nice! So many happy workers as well. Heavily staffed, so yes, the Sandwhich is made \"fast!!!\" At the same time great tasting :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten at plenty of Sandwich shops, or when I was in high school I worked at a deli.  I will tell you hands down this Sandwich shop rocks.  For the price of the sandwich you get alot.  The sub is advertised as 8 inces long but they load it up with quality meats and cheeses.  The veggie toppings are very fresh on top of it all.  The greatest aspect is regardless of price they always deliver to the office."}
{"text":"Excellent subs.  Jimmy Johns sets the bar for many other sandwich shops.  They are fast, fresh, and affordable.  The small subs are around 5 bucks and the large ones are 6 w/ tax.  You can get them on a french roll or bread.  Everything tastes pretty fresh.  I like the LULU with sprouts, cucumbers, and peppers.  I wish there was a Jimmy Johns closer to me.  I would like to try them all."}
{"text":"The deli meats aren't the best, so the two or three times I end up here are usually out of desperation or I'm just tired of walking out of other places. The bread is good and I always stick to the veggie version. Nothing to write home about, but it's a safe lunch choice and only 7 bucks for sandwich and chips. I actually had to sit and wait for my sandwich in empty place, which is a bit unusual, but it tasted the same in the end, just add sprouts and onion."}
{"text":"Great place to eat...true jimmy john fashion freakishly fast...the staff is always very helpful. When we walk in the staff always greets us with a smile and a big Hello!!! The only thing is no tip jar so how can i tip their great service... lol i recommend to anyone great place to eat especially if your in a hurry!!!"}
{"text":"This was one of my fastest JJs trips ever. This time, my sandwich was actually done before I was finished paying! So it really was \"freaky fast\". Super friendly workers!  If you're a newbie, the best subs imo are Turkey Tom & Beach Club if you're feeling hungry. Obviously you've gotta make sure to get those sprouts on either one. If you don't have sprouts, did you even really have Jimmy John's"}
{"text":"I just ordered a sandwich here and walked to fill up my drink. The sandwich was done before I could even get ice in my cup!! How cow that is fast. Tastes great too! Thanks JJ for freaky fast today"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Jimmy John's.  In fact, when I was at the Starbuck's next door a number of months ago and I inquired as to what was going in next door and they told me Jimmy John's, I squealed...literally.    Well, they finally opened.  I'm hoping they're just getting over some new location issues but it's been a few weeks now and today they've stumbled more than ever before.  Placing orders takes longer than usual their credit card machines move slower than they did in the 90's.  The last time we were there my husband got a pickle and it was covered in white \"goop\", if you will.  Picture it.  Needless to say, my husband didn't eat it.  Today I used their app to place an order on my way home from work.  I got there to pick it up but because everything was running so slow despite there being just one family in there when I arrived, it took just as long so placing the order in advance saved me absolutely no time.  Hopefully as things move along they get more in their game."}
{"text":"The sandwiches where kind of disappointing... I was expecting more but they're actually very tiny, not filling at all. :(   I had the gargantuan thinking it would be the best choice- still hungry after eating the whole thing. Full size.   Fast delivery though... Not worth the money."}
{"text":"This was a last resort for food as we saw they were open late. I ordered a #1 wrapped in lettuce. When I opened it, I was shocked at how much Mayo they had slathered on there. It was pretty disgusting. I would eat at subway over this place any day. I have to say that their chips were pretty good."}
{"text":"Awesome! Placed online order and in about 20 mins, delivery was here, even with all the rain. Thank you! Food is always good."}
{"text":"The worst service ever. I have order for delivery and I waited for ever + 45 minutes to an hour. I'm students and during exams I need to recharge so I can study and refocus. If you are student and you want something fast and good service I don't recommend this place. Not only that when I called the manager wasn't even considerate, I will never order from this place again and I don't recommend this place at all. I don't know if they realize that there are plenty of other options in the market now and they really need to improve."}
{"text":"Super fast service! The bread is always fresh and I love their Italian vinaigrette. #5 vito is the way to go. I do wish you could it it hot though, that would be delicious!"}
{"text":"We were skeptical to order delivery from a place like this, but it turned out to be a great experience. Ordered online two subs. I got a club sandwich and the other one was a veggie. Both were good sandwiches.   I timed the delivery from when i hit the order button online until my door bell rang. Time.....13 mins 16 seconds. That IS Freaky Fast!!  Had a side of salt and vinegar chips which were also good! Total cost was $14.25 for food and delivery charge ($1.51). Then once you add your tip, those sandwiches become pretty expensive, but we expected to pay for convenience.   4/5 stars as the sandwiches could have been bigger and the cost was a little high."}
{"text":"Slowest jimmy johns that I've ever been to....I wanted to scream....can I scream in this place or will that wake these jimmy John people up and they'll actually get moving?!  GrrrR"}
{"text":"This has been my only experience with this chain, and it wasn't promising. I went in on my way to run an errand at lunch. I was headed to Chipotle that I knew was a solid bet, because it is an unfamiliar part of town for me, but I saw Jimmy John's and decided to give it a go.   I walked in and was greeted by blaring music. Obnoxious blaring music. I got into line behind a weary mom with a young kid. The staff was rude and a little condescending to her when she was asking to split a sandwich between her and her son.   Honestly I felt really bad for the lady who had to put up with the f bomb coming over the speakers and the d-bag college staff who didn't have much respect.  Sorry, that is a huge turn off for me.  I ordered my sandwich and was underwhelmed. It just wasn't anything to rave about. It was OK, but there are much brighter stars in the valley sandwich game.  I know I won't ever go into this particular location again, I may try another Jimmy John's again, but honestly, I probably will go to a Cheba Hut, or a Dilly's a half a dozen times before I do this one again.   Fail."}
{"text":"There is a reason this location has such a low rating. I order from various Jimmy John locations regularly and I have never experienced the nonchalant attitude and lack of service that I have with any other location. My initial order was placed online and then I had to call regarding the first error. I had to order my sandwich twice and two times they still did not get it right. I spoke to the manager and of course its someone who is barely a legal adult and just doesn't care about the quality of the service.  I guess this is what I get for not getting up and just going to a REAL deli. I expected that I could get my simple sandwich order without any issues. I would NOT suggest ordering from this location online. Go in person so that you can absolutely ensure that your order is prepared correctly.  The only thing that they did correctly was getting it to my door quickly."}
{"text":"We were in town for a convention and decided to have lunch at jimmy johns and wow the subs were really good! They had fresh bread that was mind blowing and the staff was really nice! There was nothing to really complain about! Veggies were fresh, bread fresh and lunch meat was as if it came right off the slicer! Only knock that I had was it closed at 6 or 7...so pretty good"}
{"text":"Too bad-they had excellent service etc. corporate decided they will no longer deliver beyond El Mirage and Bell Road. They have lost $30.00 per week to other companies (Literally 2 steps beyond imaginary boundaries). When they go out of business, due to competition, perhaps they will recognize you should convenience the customers. Good riddance."}
{"text":"Derek is a fantastic owner. My email is Texasmike936@gmail.com if he reads it have him give me a message"}
{"text":"Place was clean not busy and fast.   Ordered a number 5 which is a Vito. Sandwich came out even, and not messy at all. They didn't over do the dressing and the meat to veggies to bread ratio was good.   Sandwich was good, chips were good also. The iced tea tasted strange but no big deal I decided to change it to Dr Pepper.   Just like all the other jimmy johns so no complaints."}
{"text":"I have used Jimmy John's delivery at this location for almost 2 years now with no problems! Today, it took an HOUR and 10 minutes to get to me! When I called to ask about where my order was, the guy just told me, well we delivered to other people before yours, so he should be there soon. 30 minutes later the delivery guy was awkward, didn't make eye contact and could careless that I waited so long. I think I might have to put this location on hold until they can get their drivers or delivery system fixed."}
{"text":"My first time in here. I ordered the #9. Some sort of Italian hybrid 8 inch sub.  Skip the tomatoes add cucumbers.  The sandwich was meaty and a little too much lettuce and not enough oil and vinegar. The bun was a little hard I think. Was disappointed that they don't offer hot sandwiches.  Value at $6.49 plus $1.50 soft drinks is very nice.  Couldn't finish the sub. Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Place was very clean but a little to loud on the music. I will be back for another go sometime.  Better than Subway for sure."}
{"text":"Big long hair. In my sub. Manager very rude, accusing me of planting for a free sub!! Never never never go there"}
{"text":"Ordered sandwich for delivery as we did a couple weeks ago. This time though we only ordered one sandwich instead of several. Curiously this time we were out of delivery range ( which was basically across the street). Could it be because we only ordered one sandwich this time?  Only the manager mikey knows for sure!  And its too bad because as transplants from hawaii we just discovered jimmy johns and love the sandwiches and would have been regulars with generous tips.   Auwe (shame on you) jimmy johns!"}
{"text":"I was pretty hungry and wanted a simple yet satisfying meal. I stoped by Jimmy John's because I had eaten here once before and had gotten the sandwich with salami and turkey on it. I can't remember what the name was now since I'm doing this review after I had visited there. It was very quick service, before I had even finished telling the guy what I wanted the sandwich was ready for me. I got a large sandwich with everything on it, on white bread. So delicious I finished the entire sandwich!"}
{"text":"I came in here for lunch with my 2 kids.  I ordered a tuna club. I received it on a sub roll and they said thats how it comes.  The picture on the menu clearly shows wheat bread. How has a club turned into a sub? anyway they fixed it no problem but the sandwich was just awful. no taste.  My kids ordered a slim with turkey and they wouldn't  even change the cheese for me, provolone only they said!  I hate how jimmy johns makes you ask for napkins and a packet of mustard.  could this restaurant be any cheaper?The cashier was a nice kid but his teeth were rotted horribly.  I felt bad for him but it completely ruined my appetite.  I understand everyone needs to work but I feel they should put somebody with a better image when working at the front counter.     I will never ever be going back."}
{"text":"Not sure what the fascination with this place is.  I got the Vito Sub.  It was an italian sub.  The bread was hard, and not great, and I do like French Bread, so that wasn't the problem.  Saw them make it, it was just pre-portioned meat that they slapped on the bread, then added some lettuce tomato, cheese, and dressing.  I would say this place is about on par with Speedway (the gas station) subs.  But Speedways subs are $4 for 12\", so I'll pick speedway for price.  If you want really good subs, try Penn Station East Coast Subs, Firehouse Subs, or Dibella's Subs.  They're all a lot better than this place.  Even Subway is better, and it's cheaper."}
{"text":"Drive all the way to this location to find out they are not participating in the dollar subs!!! How did we find out? A nice sign in the door. What a waste of my time, gas and energy. The fact that this location already has three stars and then does not participate in a national appreciate day says it all about this location! Avoid it."}
{"text":"I normally love jimmy johns but their platters were horrible. My company order from them for an event not only did the miss half the order but the sandwiches were not even made right. One sandwich had a little small piece of ham and the rest was cheese it was very disappointing. The bread was not soft like usual and it really was disappointing because you can tell they didn't even care to make the order right. I don't know of I would ever order a catering event again"}
{"text":"They really don't even deserve the one star but if you are ordering for delivery expect it to be at least an hour. If you call it's always it's out for delivery or they are pulling up right now and it will still take another 20 minutes after that. For a company that is supposedly \"super fast\" this location has failed. I am not basing this on just one experience unfortunately I have given them many of opportunities and will no longer be ordering from them. Very disappointed!!!!!! My boss even order a pizza and that came before my sandwich wtf.. Well if you have time to waste and are not very hungry than order from this location."}
{"text":"First time here. Lots to look at.  Very inviting inside. Had a Vito sub. Not exciting,  but good. I would come again"}
{"text":"Always quick. Same delivery people who are usually very friendly! Great food"}
{"text":"Normally I love jimmy John's, but ordered on the app for future order 11:30 to 11:45 today and it was late, not labeled correctly, missing a cookie that was paid for, the pickle wasn't even cut thoroughly, no straw for the soda, which had no I've and was watered down, & they added vinegrette on the wrong sandwich."}
{"text":"1st time visit to any Jimmy Johns, and the last time. Not sure on how their  sandwiches are supposed to taste but the bread was so hard that your bit into it and all the fixings squeezed out. Lettuce wasn't fresh, asked for peppers on the sandwich and didn't get them. Service and staff were friendly enough. Not sure why Jimmy John's doesn't have any kind if hot sandwiches, plenty of other place to get a cold hard sandwich."}
{"text":"I really hate to be negative, but this location really let us down. Ordered a few sandwiches online for pick up. When we got home, the sandwiches were missing many of the ingredients, and had the most pathetic amount of meat possible. It was almost laughable. I understand things happen, people make mistakes but what I really can't fathom is when we called and the lack of care or concern received from customer service was just appalling. Haven't really had much Jimmy John's before so I don't know what to compare it to. But I can easily say I will definitely never go back to this location."}
{"text":"I've always loved Jimmy John's, so I really wanted to order a giant party sub from here for my son's first birthday party. I was a little nervous because of the negative Yelp reviews and because not everybody at the location even knew they did party subs. I went for it anyways, and I'm so glad I did, because the sandwich looked impressively awesome and tasted great too. Everbody loved it. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because they charged me extra for cheese on a \"turkey and cheese\" sandwich!"}
{"text":"I only frequent this location about once a month- I personally recommend the Turkey Tom.  However, nothing really special about it.  I would have given this a three stars but felt the need to bump it to four due to how nice the people are.  I always get friendly service when I come here!  The bread was a bit hard on my last sandwich though.  Customer Service 5- Food- 3... Average 4"}
{"text":"Just had this for the first time yesterday. I assume that the woman taking my order was new because she wasn't aware of certain things on the sandwiches. The order was made promptly but she actually forgot to add on one of my sandwiches. Other than that, very fresh bread and quality meat."}
{"text":"Good spot for a quick and easy lunch. The guys who work there are quick at preparing your sandwich and getting you out the door. I like the Pepe"}
{"text":"Super good subs for super good prices. My order got here in 6 mins after placing it. Couldnt ask for much more. 5 stars"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to see what all the fuss was about and tried JJ's. Their popularity must be in the fact that they deliver because the sandwiches were mediocre at best. The bread was dry and hard on the outside and not very appetizing at all. Oh and cheese cost extra...smh. There are MANY places that blow this place out of the water in the sandwich business. I know lots of people love it but my wife and I decided we would not be back."}
{"text":"Best service.  I either go to or get delivery from this location about once a week.  Always great!  Always fast and fresh and the staff is super friendly :-)"}
{"text":"The worst service EVER. Takes them 45 mins to get your order to you after calling to check on it. Then they bring you the WRONG order. 2 days in a row.  Jimmy johns should be ashamed of this branch."}
{"text":"This location is NOT \"freaky fast\". I order from here when I am at work and it always takes about 30-40 min to get my one sandwich. The location by my home in Ahwatukee delivers in 10-15 minutes. 20 at the most.   But as always, the subs are delicious."}
{"text":"Love Jimmy John's sandwiches! Always good, always fresh... but the best thing about them is that they taste like a New York deli sandwich...which is where I'm from.  Big Shoutout to Rachel who took my order this morning just prior to opening!"}
{"text":"WOW I love this place... The Boyfriend suggested that we go here and I was kinda skeptical..  MMMMM their food is awesome! They even deliver! A sandwich (just one) even..however they do charge a delivery fee of like .75 cents an item... and that can add up when you want lots of bags of their chips... and cookies... Their food is very filling and the restaurant has an interesting atmosphere you can read all kinds of things that are on the walls."}
{"text":"There is a sign inside that says if \"we\" didn't hit the spot there is something wrong with your spot. Wow are they right! The bread is yummy and the toppings are plentiful. Yeah they are a little pricey but worth it! The Jimmy chips and the chocolate chunk cookie are great add ons too"}
{"text":"Never ate here before but came here because I didn't want to eat a huge meal. I got the Italian club and man was it delicious! I definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Jimmy John's, 5 stars for the food.  This store is very nice and appealing architecturally.  However, I am removing 1 star for there were 2 other men in the store, 8 workers, and all the tables were dirty....Another star reduction because the music is way too loud."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about this franchise so we decided to give it a try. This particular store has a drive thru or walk in. We walked in because we did not know what was on the menu. It was small inside but very clean. The staff greeted us as soon as we walked in. All sandwiches come on French Bread and it tells you what comes on it. So as we were placing our order they were actually making the sandwiches as we did so. from the time we walked in and walked out with our sandwiches was about 15 min. I got the #7 which had ham on it with cheese, tomato, mayo, lettuce and so YUMMY. My husband got #14 with extra Provolone cheese. It was delicious and we will try them again. Oh and they do deliver as well.."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's does not have hot sandwiches or soups.  They specialize in making sandwiches (a variety) and making them FAST.  If you are looking for a quick meal and don't want to eat fast food hamburgers this is the place to be.  The portions are large so find someone to share your meal with or just save it for the folks at home."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is close to my work. It's a good option for a quick meal and they deliver! I really had a hard time finding what I liked at Jimmy Johns, particularly since I wanted to stay away from bread. So one time I walked in and asked if they had salads. That's when they recommended to me an \"un-wich.\" I recommend if you are trying to stay healthy and want a quick meal option! This \"sandwich\" has a lot of crunch which I love and is basically any ingredients you want wrapped up in romaine lettuce. The service is always friendly and nice. This is your typical, fast food, lunch break option. It's not \"wowing\" me, but its good."}
{"text":"As an Illinoisan, I am a loyal JJ's fan. Beach club on wheat, add sprouts or Italian nightclub on French. Get the enormous, Claussen-esque pickle quartered and if you like salt and vinegar chips, these are awesome! The oatmeal raisin cookie is good, too. The delivery range is small(2 miles), but keep in mind that you can call ahead an order or it will take 2 seconds if you order upon arrival.   This isn't the best location ever, as employees are sometimes unfriendly or lacking attention to detail with additions or requesting napkins with delivery. Overall, I still love Jj's and this location provides the same quality of food as others. They have crushed ice, too! Order a loaf of day-old French bread for 50 cents or $1 for fresh loaf. Both great!"}
{"text":"Food poisoning from this location. We recieved a group order of 30 sandwiches for a buisness meeting lunch.. 4 out of 23 employees were sick by the the end of day. NEVER eating here again, should of known something was wrong by the quality of the sandwiches. This place has no quality control, amateur hour at its finest."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to get our tuna sandwiches. Fresh and tasty. My only semi-complaint is to bag to go items for your customers."}
{"text":"I am thrilled that we have so many new lunch options here on Mill Avenue.  After the deserved demise of Uno's & several other local eat haunts, the recent resurgence of restaurants (Regions is back, 5 Guys Burgers & Fries just opened, and now this) tickles my belly to no end!  Jimmy John's lives up to it's tag line so far, \"World's Greatest Gourmet Sandwiches, Since 1983\".  I believe they opened yesterday or over the weekend, but we tried them today for lunch for the first time and MAN-OH-MAN, am I happy!!  I went right for the jugular (or large aorta, as it were) with \"The J.J. Gargantuan\".  Billed as \"...huge enough to feed the hungriest of all humans...\", this sandwich supreme sated my hunger like no other.  Like most JJ's sandwiches it's served on a deliciously toasty french bread (read hoagie roll), that was perfectly moist on the inside yet flaky crusty on the outside.  This king-sized concoction comes loaded with Genoa salami, smoked ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey & provolone.  I got mine with lettuce, tomato, extra mayo and peppers (like a hoagie should be eaten).  It was AMAZING!  I also ordered a large coke (yes, they have Cherry Coke!!), a pickle (not just a spear, but a HUGE billyclub sized monster spliced in half) and JJ's own brand of Sea Salt & Vinegar chips.  All said (and remember -- I went large for lunch ladies & gents), it put me back a mere $11.69.  The pickle, chips & coke were all extras, so had I just gotten the sammie alone it would have only been $7.25 + tax.    My two petite co-workers went for the #4 Turkey Tom and they were both raving as well.  You can also get any of the sammies as \"JJ Unwich\" style, meaning no bread -- lettuce wrap.  Cool!  Didn't try the cookies, but they  looked yummy.  You can also buy their day old bread for $0.49!  Fondue anyone?  The staff was super friendly and lived up to the other JJ motto, \"Subs so fast you'll freak!\"  We are DEF hitting Jimmy John's again soon!"}
{"text":"This is the best Jimmy John's in town. It's not just the sandwiches but it's the customer service. The owners and everyone that works there takes so much pride in what they do and the food they make. Wasn't sure about the tuna but they let me try it first and the tuna was delicious. Tastes freshly made even though it was already 9:00 at night."}
{"text":"I had a disappointing experience a couple weeks ago at this store. The manager called me a couple of times and after finally connecting he apologized for the errors with my order, assured me that more attention would be paid and offered to pay for my next order. I never had an issue in the past with Jimmy John's. I'm happy to say that even when errors occurred, the store went out of their way to correct them and did so with great customer service. It's definitely appreciated. I will continue to order from here."}
{"text":"Damn  Small hair in my JJBLT. fucking disgusting! White at the root and black at the tip. Someone old.   And turn the damn music down so you can hear me place my order!  NOT GOING BACK.   Subs so fast HAIR MAY FALL INTO THEM."}
{"text":"In honor of how fast they make their sandwiches, I will be brief.  If we are to be honest it's a regular college/senior place to work (socialize), no one looks lik they are allowed to set foot in a bar. Yet, do not forsake our new and young minds, they may not know how to comb their hair but their metabolic rate is at peak form and they are using it. My expectations for this place  are: Fast, tasty and cheap food. They do it, and they repeat it when asked.  Thank you!  RL"}
{"text":"As always a quick stop and the quality is excellent for the bucks, beats Subway all to hell!"}
{"text":"For the most part, their sandwiches are delicious, as long as their staff is paying attention!    Earlier this week, my fiancé and I picked up sandwiches to go, only to find out once we got to work that his was made incorrectly. We called and asked if they would be willing to deliver the correct sandwich to our business which was located less than a mile away, (if we didn't have to be at work we would have just taken it back) however they told us policy wouldn't allow them to do that and we would have to come to their location with receipt to make sure they actually made it. That's understandable, inconvenient, but I understand business's have regulations.. We decided to let it go.    We tried it again tonight, thinking our previous experience was a fluke. And once again, took our food to work, and my sandwich was completely incorrect. This time we brought it back.    IF I ever want to eat from here again, I'll make a point to open up the sandwich and check before I leave the store since the employees do not pay attention to customized orders."}
{"text":"HUGE shout out to Jimmy Johns for having me pay 14 bucks for a tuna sandwich and then forgetting to put the tuna on it. Well done."}
{"text":"So today may 17 2018 I came in at around 1030 to order some food after telling my order to the manager that was at the counter I proceeded in asking if they do a veteran or military discount as a habit of asking due to being prior active he kindly said no I'm sorry we don't as I was going to pay he said not to worry about it and thank you for your service I am beyond greatfull for the kind appreciation from this store and there employees will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I was personally offended that the girl working the cash register did not want to give me the military discount \"because I wasn't in uniform.\" Even though I showed my Military ID. Her explanation was that the owner told them that was the policy.  I preceded to explain that I had gotten the discount at this location as well as other locations before. She finally did give me the discount after I explained that. I just hope the owner understands that we're not aloud to wear our uniform unless we're on duty that day because of the high threat level towards US Military Forces. I'm not petty by any means, but that was just plane disrespectful."}
{"text":"I like Jimmy John's, but I LOVE this location. The staff is PHENOMENAL! Friendly, and of course they are freaky fast. The manager and his staff are energetic, friendly and took great care of me and my any-day-expectant wife. You know the food, but the team here separate this location from any other. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Seems this one star rating will fall in line with all the others like it.   This location is horrible and has now thrown me off of Jimmy John's for good.   A few days ago we placed an online order for pickup. I had a Vito without the extra lettuce, and cucumbers. My son had a turkey sandwich with missing mayo packets on the side and no additional bacon that I paid for, my daughter had a ham sandwich with missing mayo packets.   When I picked up the sandwiches (which I paid for online) the guy at the register shoved the bag at me like I was a burden to him. He didn't even have me sign the credit card slip.   We get home, after 30 minutes due to other errands to find all the above things wrong. My son was highly disappointed as he loves bacon.  So I called the store. I was greeted with \"oh let me remake it for you\" sorry nope I'm not wasting my time driving back. Then they offered to give me a discount on my next visit. When I mentioned I wouldn't be back he said  \"well what do you want\" with an attitude. I said I wanted at least a $3 refund in a $19 order. I wasn't asking for much. He offered the discount again, to which I refused.   I asked for the supervisor, they had me on hold about three minutes and the call was dropped. He took down my name and number prior so he could have called back. I decided the argument was not worth it, and realized they just would never receive my business."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been here and I do not know if all of jimmy johns are the same but food is truly freaky fast. I have had 2 different types of subs and the are very tasty. Thank you for the great service and the food. We appreciate great businesses like yours."}
{"text":"The delivery is so darn fast.  Food is always fresh and excellent and their cookies are so delicious.  There was a mix up in my order today and when I called the restaurant, they corrected it right away.  Friendly, awesome service.  I will order from them again.  So glad they are in the University City area since we need a healthy sandwich place like this instead of all the junk fast food around here."}
{"text":"Never eaten here before and never will again. Not sure if it's just this location or if they all suck. First of all, customer service here sucks and they have zero personality. We are a large family [7 total] we walk in and they literally all just stare at us. No greeting, no expression, nothing.....so awkward! The food is boring and bland. I had to open my sandwich and clean the mayo off because there was so much it was running down my arm. Didn't read the menu well enough and made the mistake of taking avocado spread as actual avocado. All 7 of us have nothing to say but YUCK! So nasty and a total waste of time and money. Should have gone to subway....."}
{"text":"Good evening,  I have been living in Huntersville for a half of decade. For the last 2 years or so, about 2-3 times a month I visit jimmy johns for \"day old bread\". I'm typically served almost immediately each time. Tonight was different. Around 6pm I visisted jimmy johns as usual and didn't receive my typical ok service. I was  -Not greeted. -Wasn't called up to get my order , and when I walked up to make my order I was told \"I will be right with you\".  This also took place with the lady before me. The guy there was alone and basically ran back in forth from the oven to the register without even acknowledging me. I was in the store for over 15 mins before I was finally acknowledged without even a hello.   I am sure there are people who want a job. Why does a place like jimmy johns have just 1 employee working who clearly needs help."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is the drive-through. The kids working there are very rude, and the subs are sub par to the surrounding sub places in the area. In a pinch its convenient and not horrible."}
{"text":"Fast, good, and reasonably priced!  Kind of drooling just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I'm only giving one star as I have no choice (that I can tell).  Here's my story...  Yesterday we called to have food delivered.  After the experience I had, I wrote on their facebook wall.  \"They\" wrote me back to ask if I had spoken to a manager about my experience.  This is my response back...  Yes I did but by that time, the csr Ryan had already upset me so bad, there was no going back. The guy was the rudest I've encountered yet. We are walking distance from the cutoff for delivery but was totally willing to drive up the street to Chandler Regional to pick up. He acted like he didn't want to do that but then said ok. Although he admitted he lives next to this hospital himself, he wanted me to give him the address for \"safety\" reasons. So, I googled the hospital and gave him the address that was on the hospital website. He then argued that the address I had given him was not an address he had in his system from prior deliveries there... Kept putting me on hold (about 5 times) to check with his manager... I ask him if he HAD the address, why was he insistent that I give him what he already knows... He said, \"you know what?! We're not delivering to you as you are outside our delivery area!\". I was in the process of speaking when he intrupided me to tell me this. I had found another address for the hospital and was trying to give that one to him. He continuely over spoke me... He was rude! He was unprofessional. He was condesceding. I was willing to drive to freaken pick up the order although it's stupid not to drive one more block to deliver... Actually less than! I understand boundries which is why I was willing to compromise. I was in no way, form or fashion rude or even demanding with this jerk... Until, of course, he wouldn't shup up long enough to hear me... THE CUSTOMER! The manager who came to the phone was just as condescending. \"I will talk to Ryan...\". No she won't! She was feeding him the information and he was speaking it to me, THE CUSTOMER, with her right there as there was no delay in him hanging up and her picking up. This behavior is so much more than unacceptable. We had had an awesome day as a family and was winding down and decided we'd order from there. His unprofessionislm and rudeness **** near ruined my night which in turned caused my family upset. I expect and will accept nothing less than professionislm when dealing with a company where I am a paying customer!  Not only will I ever call them or eat there again, I will tell anyone who will listen to avoid this location, at the very least!  And, of course, they haven't responded..."}
{"text":"I mapped out this JJ location to my house and it is 2.8 miles (6 minute drive), but I called and apparently I'm out of their delivery zone. HUH? 2.8 miles and you don't deliver to me?  No wonder you can be freaky fast, you only deliver to places that are 2 blocks away.  Good business model, don't deliver to people in your same area."}
{"text":"Unprofessional and rude staff. I was not greeted and then when I said \"hi can I ask you a question\" the young male at the counter said \"what\". After he handed me my order I said \"thank you\" and his reply was \"yeah\"."}
{"text":"\"Fresh smells!\" \"Subs so fast you'll freak!\"  These are only two of the many silly signs that Jimmy Johns has.  Everytime I come into Jimmy Johns, everyone is just so nice to me!  I love the subs. My two favorite, and the only ones I've actually tried, are the Gargantuan add bacon and the Italian Nightclub add bacon. What can I say? I love bacon! They are tasty and fresh. The sub bread is so good! You can even buy the bread and take it home for later which I have done.  Jimmy Johns for the win!"}
{"text":"I've picked up a sandwich from this Jimmy John's in Goodyear AZ a couple of times, and my original rating remains unchanged (3 stars). But something happened today to change my opinion about them, and I doubt I'll go back again. One of our co-workers in the office \"won\" a drawing at JJ's, for an office lunch. He was promised 15 sandwiches for the office, and told us all about it last week. He scheduled the delivery for Monday and we all figured, hey, free lunch on Monday, what a great deal! Then the sandwiches came. The \"15 sandwiches\" were really 5 sandwiches, at the most. It could have been as few as 3, I'm not sure. Each one was about 3 to 4\" long, and there was hardly anything inside the bread. The one I had contained one thin slice of meat and some lettuce, and a part of a slice of a tomato. And Mayo, of course. Great finger sandwich as an appetizer for something else, but I would not even consider that to be a suitable lunch for my 6-year old grandson, let alone a \"gourmet sub.\" Nothing else came with it, either. No chips, no cookies, nothing. Some great prize. I felt sorry for our co-worker, who was clearly embarrassed through no fault of his own.  So I'll repeat, I don't plan to patronize this particular establishment again."}
{"text":"I went their for the first time yesterday, and it was Freaky Fast. Been to a couple shops here in town before so not disappointed as always."}
{"text":"Great! Huge sandwiches, super fast delivery to our office for quick lunches! Friendly staff, too."}
{"text":"Pretty horrible place subway,  firehouse, blimpys, mr goodscents, cousins, Jersey mikes, safeway sub, pretty much any other sub place is 100000 times better, the staff was horrible the food tasted like it was left over from last week and this sub franchise has to be the worst in the valley."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that I work at another jimmy johns location so I fully understand how things work here!  A few weeks ago my boyfriend got hair in his sandwich. Gross.  Today we tried it again and I ordered my sandwich with avocado. No avocado was on the sandwich. We called the store for a refund and the guy was a dick. Joked about giving us our money back.   Will not return"}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is a newer concept to this area, but will quickly fall into Subway status. They have a good concept of throwing a sandwich together for you in milliseconds, but their quality is lacking. Kent should have more truly authentic delis. Not sure if there is enough diversity for that, but it would be nice."}
{"text":"Two words: MAYO and Bread. Too much mayo and the bread is stiff. I can make the same sandwich at home and that doesn't say much for Jimmy John's. I've ordered from here and I've been in the store. Yes you are left to fend for your own bag, napkins etc. I give them all the credit for getting me the sandwich extremely quick, but the quality of the subs are average. If I was ever to like one particular sub out of them all it would be the Gargantuan. I don't know if I'd order from them if I have the time and could drive over to Jersey Mike's. Great for being in a pinch."}
{"text":"Not very professional  no taste won't go back very expensive was clean but just opened and really don't no what there doing subway were back!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrific experience! Ordered for devilery spoke to Anthony! He was absolutely one of the best conversationalist I've ever spoke to! Stunning on knowledge of the menu! Very please thank you Anthony for the wonderful delightful experience. My go to Jimmy Johns!"}
{"text":"Freaky Slow... Slowest Jimmy Johns I've ever been to. There was no line when I walked in only about 4 booths taken with existing customers and it takes the guy about 3 min to ask me for my order then another 10 minutes to make the sandwich.  It is also the dirtiest one ibe ever been in as well.   I will be avoiding this location in the future."}
{"text":"I thought that I had already found the perfect sandwich when I went to Quizno's, but I was way wrong.  Jimmy John's brings lunch to a whole new level with the freshest bread I have ever tasted.  My sandwich was overflowing with ingredients from the delectable guacamole spread to the sprouts, amazing turkey, and cucumbers of the #12 (Beach Club).  I was delighted that a pickle was one of the side choices in the combo (the other options were chips or a cookie -- and the jalapeno chips that my friend ordered were excellent) and it was HUGE.  Service was fast with an assembly line of folks churning out these sandwiches with extreme precision and never missing a beat on preparing gourmet selections.  I wish this place existed where I live, since I'd be a frequent customer.  If you're craving a delicious sandwich on bread that was baked today, you must try Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"This location is close to my house. The drive thru makes it easy to quickly satisfy my pregnant crave monster at home. When she is in need of a beach club. I ordered the Italian club with Hot peppers .it really hit the spot!"}
{"text":"This store has great sandwiches!  Highly recommend their veggie!  Super friendly staff and amazingly fast service!  I will definitely be back next time I am in this area!!"}
{"text":"Why advertise a customer appreciation Dale and don't honor it!? Referred to go to other franchises! Way to turn what's supposed to be good experience into a lousy one"}
{"text":"We ate there twice with very good experiences. Food was delicious with very friendly and accommodating service. A refreshing perk."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed with my sandwich. I got a number 13 on wheat easy mayo easy lettuce. There was barely any lettuce which is fine whatever but there was still so much mayo it was disgusting. Im not sure if they switched the tomoatos theyre using but those werent too appitizing either. I love jimmy johns but today was just not a god day for them in my eyes :("}
{"text":"Food took 15 minutes. Try shorted me a drink and spilled the other drink on y food. The drink I did get, the ice was melted. Manager called, and hung up on me! I called back and that is when I found out he was the manager. Caller id says he is from Florida. Also, my tuna was warm, probably cause it sat around too long!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty average as usual for this place. The bread and veggies are always fresh and since I never get their substandard meat products, this is all I know about Jimmy John. I will say that they crunchy BBQ potato chips were clearly the best part of the sandwich. Avocado spread is an interesting invention, but maybe Jimmy can afford some real avocado's in the future?"}
{"text":"Bread was stale and hard. Meats were dried out and no dressing or so little you couldn't tell there was any at all. Will not go back!"}
{"text":"Fun fact: By the time you've read this review you could've had a sandwich made at JJs.  By the time the cashier hands you your change and you pour your soda, you will have a sandwich in your hand. Because JJs makes sandwiches freaky fast!  Bonuses: -They accurately prepare your order (my hubby and I special order our sandwiches and they have never messed up the order!)  -Consistency - you know what you're getting -The veggies are fresh (shredded lettuce, Roma tomatoes, cucumbers, avocado spread). This is a big deal for me, as brown lettuce is a real sandwich letdown.  You won't find that here.  -Fresh bread - with free smells  -Special order sandwiches and keep it low fat -They deliver (I can't review on this, as I only grab and go)  This may not be my favorite sandwich ever, but jimmy johns is winning at making you lunch in a hurry & offering a healthy alternative to normal fast food, while meeting all of the criteria (see bonuses) that I expect in a chain restaurant.   In other news: the location at Rancho and Charleston was recently remodeled. It's large, plenty of tables, clean restaurant, and good customer service."}
{"text":"Usually there ok this one keeps messing up orders. Not doing anything complicated, you know mustard not mayo sort of thing. Twice I had to run back out to switch out a sandwich. I just don't think they care...."}
{"text":"These gentlemen where excellent!! Freaky great service!! Very professional and the sandwiches were to order very yummy!! Thanks !!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the food but make sure you get it delivered, as long as you're in their area.  I've only gone to the store 1 time and that will never happen again.  It was loud and the space was a little small for all the bodies they had in there."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns never disappoints. I love their sandwiches and they are usually really quick with their delivery.  I ordered 4 sandwiches for delivery and they took a little longer than normal. When I called and asked what was taking so long they were apologetic.   The manager ended up calling me back to apologize again and offered us free sandwiches for the next time we ordered with them.  Without the call I would have gone back. Now I'll defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"So I'm not from the area... And chipotle next door had a line that would take my entire lunch break... Jimmy johns didn't have a line at all. I see why! The food is gross! I mean really ew. It's bland and disgusting at the same time.. I really don't know how they do it!   The music was nice, they prepared this \"sand which\" quickly.. But left me wishing I would not have forgotten my lunch at home, and very sad I wasted 6$. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Are you fucking kidding me I order a god damn sub and it looks like it is the size of my cock when I was 11 years old. Is small and not worth the $5 I paid. They put nothing on it. I'm very disappointed. I will not be order from them again no one understands these days that when we pay good money for what we think is gone be good and it turns out to be shit it's not cool. I have gotten other subs from here but this my friend is so horrible it makes me just turn away from it. Next time I will just stick to my regular order."}
{"text":"the food is good.   the people are quite nice.   i just have two questions:  1. why is the music so loud all the time?  2. why are there always 12 people working behind the counter in a restaurant the size of a shoebox?  that is all."}
{"text":"Of all the chain sandwich places Jimmy John's is my favorite!  It might hold a special place in my heart partly because Jimmy John's originated  in Charleston, IL 30 minutes from my home town...  But really I just love their chewy french bread and finely cut meats.  The chips they have are kettle cooked style and crunchy delicious, and their cookies are quite tasty as well.  You really can't go wrong with their food.  This Jimmy John's location is new-looking and extremely clean.  The employees are friendly, and as promised, they had my sandwich ready so fast I almost freaked.  I'm glad I don't live near this Jimmy John's because I would be tempted to eat here every day."}
{"text":"We were out shopping for a new phone at Verizon and needed to use the restrooms. So we walked in the staff was friendly. Made eye contact and greeted. The bath rooms were on point, cleanest bathrooms we have seen. . I can only imagine how clean the kitchen was. Next time I'll have to try a sub."}
{"text":"the selection was good and everything but i only got 2 slices of roast beef in my sandwich. and my friend only got 2 slices of turkey. they don't give you any meat at all."}
{"text":"This place is terrible, everytime I go there they screw up my order. I have talked to the manager there and he needs to be fired, extremely rude and unprofessional. I have been there 3 times trying to give them a chance and they screw it up everytime. Worst Jimmy John's in town. AVOID THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"I asked for a bigger cup for water, even offering to pay 25 cents for it, and they insisted if I wanted to use a cup instead of this toddler sized water cup, it was full price of a fountain drink. Then a few employees walked away, and started laughing about it. I wish I'd have just gotten a refund for my whole order and left. Won't come here again."}
{"text":"Freaky fast my a$$. I waited over a hour for delivery last time when the store is 2 min from my house. (I'm lazy okay!!) So this time I decided to go in. They had 1 girl making sandwiches while the other 2 were doing who knows what. I eneded up waiting 20 min for 1 sandwich! Ha!"}
{"text":"OK, so i am idiot, thinking things 'may be better this time', I was next door and figured Id give them another go. I could have gone 50ft - 100ft  away in the same strip mall to 5 guys, tony's etc etc, or driven less then 1 mile to 50 plus other places and gotten a good lunch...  But I guess im a sucker...Gave them another shot. I even went so far as to to tell them I was disappointed with every previous order and this is your shot to 'convert me'....I made it clear my issue was not with quality, but was moreso if I pay $ for something I expect it to be worth the $'s spent and explained I tried everything from the slims to the gargantuan, and everything in between, and was not happy and even explained further that it was not due to bad quality, but was a simple matter of 'If I pay XXXX, I need to feel those $'s were well spent, especially when comparing the same $'s spent in the same area for something similar'...  Wow, they were not busy and the employee I spoke to, polite and cordially, did nothing but apologize and tell me he would personally assure when I leave with my sandwich (3 of them actually), I would be thrilled and I would be back again as a regular customer and would never want to visit another sub shop'.....  OK, is it 3 times a charm or 20?  What I do know is when placing my order and the conversation we had, I fully expected this guy would ensure I end up happy, and ready to come back as regular customer.  Nope, not gonna happen.....Noting the above, how is it even possible they let me walk out with 3 sandwiches that could only say 'terrific, plez come back, we want your business?'  They couldnt do it & obviously, they arent too concerned with keeping repeat customers.  While I do recognize the positive reviews which puts me in the minority & can accept that. What I fail to understand is the sheer Number of items Ive gotten there, chances I have given them and how it can be possible that so many like spending $$'s for bread w/very little meat or chez when there are so many options in the same area where your $'s will actually get you a hearty sandwich/etc...  This place gets an A+ in marketing, and an F in every other area.   I see no reason to give them yet another chance. I eat 95% of my meals 'out'. I will not give this place another chance or another dollar.  All I can say to others who are happy with this place, and without sounding like a schill recoi'ng other places, I wont do that... and will only say...If you like JJ's, have you even bothered to look at others or try them?  Perhaps you should....  Happy Eating............"}
{"text":"They won't deliver if you're more than 5 minutes away. Bad customer service. I don't recommend this location."}
{"text":"First time eating here and it won't be my last!!!  For anyone who is looking for a quick, quality sandwich under 10 bucks I would highly recommend Jimmy John's. The service is excellent and one of the first things I noticed is how clean the restaurant was kept. I order the Gargantuan and it was a filling sub. Cold cuts were fresh, sliced thin, and piled high. All in all.. Great sandwich! Cant wait to explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool.  Right off Mill Ave and open till 3 am.  I love the inside it has a cool little vibe and a back door that goes right out to the patio of Fat Tuesday, Cantina, Handlebar etc."}
{"text":"Just went for the first and last time in two years.  Before I pulled out my credit card, they handed me my sandwich, roast beef.  $6 for two slices of well done, fatty roast beef with lettuce and a little tomato on a tough roll.  The mayo was the best part.  Never again."}
{"text":"I used to really love to go there and get a #9 But the music is so freaking loud now you cant even tell them your order. You really do need to employ more mature people and or have a manager that is older than 17. I can buy a full pound of roast beef or whatever i want at the deli for about the same price, and a loaf of bread for a buck. Much better"}
{"text":"What can I say, it is freaky fast.  This particular location makes good on that motto even during the lunch hour rush."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with my boyfriend and our daughter and got the WORST customer service ever. Walked in- no greeting, walked up to the cash register to order- I had to tell HER hello (no \"how may I help you\" or \" may I take your order\" or even a simple \"are you ready to order\")she just stood there completely silent and scowled( and I know she wasn't mute bc she talked to her coworkers easily lol). Sandwiches were thrown together and workers seemed more worried about what they were doing after work then actually working.  No I don't expect a full conversation to be made but it would've been nice to get a hello at least. I've been to many other jimmy johns and I've never had a bad experience until coming to this one?"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time this week. My sub was tasty but just a roastbeef and cheese sub on a cursty roll. Can't figure out what all the rage over this chain is about. It's fast service which is great when you need food fast. But it's a little over priced sandwhich and fountain drink both. My lunch was $8.  The place is clean but not really inviting as 90% of the customers take it to go or eat at an outdoor table."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's and this location is great. It's close to my office, and the staff have always been ultra friendly and live up to the Jimmy J Slogan \"Subs So Fast You'll Freak!\""}
{"text":"I really want to like Jimmy John's. Seriously, I do. But if Jimmy won't meet me halfway, then there's not a lot I can do!   The subs seem like they should be awesome, but they always disappoint me. If the menu tells you a sub has mayonnaise on it, expect it to be literally dripping with it. And apparently Jimmy just can't say no to the avocado spread, because I always tell them to hold it and they still pile it on. I hate to complain about the workers, because I always find them to be so friendly and helpful... but they never get my order right!  Somehow Jimmy John's still manages to lure me in every so often, but I always regret it afterwards. And life is too short to eat regretful sub sandwiches."}
{"text":"Go here a lot and their staff and owners ( on site) are Always the nicest, friendliest most thankful people that we have run into, in the Resturant business.  Their restrooms are always clean which gives me a good feeling about the food prep.  Sandwiches are always fresh, seriously tasty and ready in no time.  I always ask them to slice them in half or they will leave the whole sandwich in tact.  I am always welcomed and thanked before I leave.   You have to respect the owners for working every bit as hard as their staff, as I always see them hard at work doing prep work or taking orders and I am sure all the other ownership responsibilities they must perform that are not seen by the public.  Best service in Las Vegas so far, and yes that means better than some higher end places here in town.  A+++"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have reviewed a restaurant on-line and felt compelled to say something due to the very poor customer service at this location on 16th street and Glendale. I decided to stop by this location because my husband and daughter wanted Panda just around the corner. I ordered the Slim #5 which comes with meat and cheese only. I assumed it was simply a smaller sandwhich which is really all I wanted and did not notice the small writing under the name saying \"any sub without the sauce and veggies\" and would have ordered something different had I known. I also ordered a combo which comes with a drink, there was no tea left in the container so I asked the employee if there was anymore and he said \"no, sorry we do not have any\", so I persisted and asked if they were going to make anymore and he said \"I don't think we have any more tea bags\". I was bumbed to say the least because I do not drink soda but paid for a combo. When I returned to eat with my family I noticed the sandwich issue. I went back and talked with manager who was less than helpful because he said they could put mayo and lettuce on the sandwich but he would have to charge me for it, he said \"is that ok\" and I said \" no it is not ok\". I guess I expected a little grace and they would make it right with the customer this time. He said with a smile as I walked out the door \"Have a nice day\". On top of this all when I returned to my family to eat I noticed there was hole in my cup and my drink was leaking all over the place. I will not be dining at this restaurant again nor will I recommend to my friends. I should have dined at Panda instead. :-("}
{"text":"They have a drive-thru!  What?!  Yes!  Never seen a Jimmy John's with one before, but it's great!  This Jimmy John's is located on Durango Drive, next door to a the former Carmine's (now a Dotty's), in a strip center.  The drive-thru is in the back of the entire building.  One Jimmy John's is the same as the rest- same menu and speedy fast sandwiches.  I've noticed that their menu has changed slightly- addition of cucumbers, bringing back sprouts (if wanted), etc.  Some Jimmy John's give punch cards (Maryland Parkway location, for example) but this one doesn't give punches and doesn't accept the free sandwich cards.  Kinda random.  I'm going to see if they deliver to my house for next time, because sometimes I'm craving their bread- it's so good!"}
{"text":"This location is very close to the UNLV Campus, on Maryland Parkway, behind the Starbucks.  They are VERY fast!  I like their Tuna or their Turkey Tom.  You can add items (cheese) or subtract items (tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.) without any problems.  Service is nice and the bread is yummy!  Fast & filling lunch!  Don't forget to ask for the punch card!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Jimmy Johns, we don't have one in Sacramento yet so we always eat there when we can."}
{"text":"The place is pretty clean. The staff are helpful and the service is fast. They would remove the bread and fill it with lettuce to make the sub healthy. The veggies are so fresh compared to subway."}
{"text":"I order from this Jimmy Johns quite often and I must say they are fast and the food is alway fresh. Definately a good place to get a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Place sucks. Straight up, I'm returning with vengeance. Fuck this place. These are some bland meat submarines. Music is too loud too."}
{"text":"Love the #12 beach club and my boyfriend gets the Italian night club with hot peppers! They are close to our place and very fast!"}
{"text":"Speedy service, like 30 seconds to make the sandwich literally everytime I've ever been. And my order is never wrong, I love the avocado spread!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing bread and I always get the #17 with lots of hot peppers.   The bread is moist but really chewy and different from other sandwich shops I have tried.   The service here is always friendly and fast. The restrooms are clean and store is clean."}
{"text":"Two young guys working in there around 1pm today. Rude service. Didn't get the bread right. Guy in a ponytail slamming stuff and and stating \"F--- I just burnt the bread.\"  Very negative atmosphere on an otherwise great day. No way this place or chain will survive with that face on it."}
{"text":"One hour for delivery isn't exactly \"freaky fast\" from southpointe to canonsburg. Email order tracking system is nice but it took 45 minutes for our food to arrive after it said food was out for delivery."}
{"text":"I ordered the Italian sandwich, it was mediocre but was not bad. Reason I only leave one star is because some guy that is apparently a regular there walked up to me when I was in line and asked me if I'm done ordering yet... Not sure who in their right mind would approach someone they don't know in line ordering food and ask him if they're done ordering yet. The cashier at the moment didn't ask the gentleman to wait his turn, so I had to take matters into my own hands and make sure the  fellow had his attitude adjusted correctly and not to make rude and disrespectful comments to people he doesn't know. Additionally, the girl that handed me my sandwich was not very friendly at all. I would most likely not return to this location, at least not by choice."}
{"text":"Best subs in Charlotte...good bread. CHEAP! And speedy polite service :) I am always pleased. :p  Only business in America that doesn't have a minimum delivery fee too!!!"}
{"text":"The workers are so nice! I just stopped on my way back from a 5k and wandered in (the door was propped open) but it was early... they didn't even have a problem with it.  They just took my order like it was no big deal.    Obviously, super fast. Really yummy veggie sandwich - I'm a vegetarian and I love that there is a veggie option ON THE MENU!   Don't forget to ask for a pickle!"}
{"text":"Good food and very nice staff. They will even serve you before they open while they are setting up for the day.  Big fan of the beach club wrapped in lettuce.  Be wary though that they get the order right. I have had them, out of habit, accidentally put items on subs that I requested not being on them."}
{"text":"One of the best locations I've been to. Staff is friendly and courteous and the sandwiches are exactly what you'd expect it to be! Fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"This location is clean, the food is good and the people are OK. The location is great; there are other food offerings around. There is also a Starbucks three doors down.  Be advised that this location is located in a strip mall - not easily seen from the main road."}
{"text":"This is a Jimmy John's closest to my work so I have no choice but to order from here. About one out of five times I get my order right I usually order the same thing today I ordered my sandwich but asked for peppers on the side plus peppers on the sandwich of course I didn't get that right sometimes I asked for no tomato they always give me tomato about three times out of five they have really bad customer service delivery people that just come in and take the money and leave there's no thank you or have a nice day some people are in such a rush they asked twice it's the price it's this price and I'm like just hold on and I'll give you the money very impatient and the delivery time is usually really long I'm not happy with this place at all but I have no choice but to keep going to this place for my fucking sandwiches"}
{"text":"Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy Should I count the ways? I would have to stop at #8 For that's my favorite sandwich of late Though number 9 Is that of a friend of mine. Your Fresh, your fast, Always on point-- In deed you are One of the best sandwich joints. Thank you for lunch,  The crew was splendid Friendly meets flavorful... Perfectly blended. My hope? That more will read this and visit Saying, \"hooray to Jimmy my search has ended!\""}
{"text":"This Jimmy John's location is super tiny. No seating inside, but just a grab and go location. The smells of the bread definitely make up and down most of 3rd street and onto Tryon and Church. The staff is super friendly and they whoop up a sandwich in no time flat. Also, the bike delivery in uptown is solid. Called and it was ready less than 10 minutes after.   Not that I'm an avid Jimmy John's goer, but the Unwich is delicious. Lettuce wrap instead of bread. I got the veggie option with sprouts, guac, peppers, cucumbers, and tomatoes. Definitely fresh and refreshing. Great for a quick lunch on the go. I dig that they make the wrap easy to eat whilst walking.   Thanks, Jimmy!"}
{"text":"Plain and simple, Jimmy John's really does make a mean sandwich and I appreciate their little quips in and around their stores. The brand has an irreverence that not many other brands embrace, or at least embrace well.   This location is probably my favorite in town. There aren't any tables or seating, except a very small bar where you can stand to eat. Wolfing down a sammy and then getting on with your day is just so American, right? These guys do a great job. Every time my wife and I have visited, our order has been taken, prepared and handed to us within 3 minutes. Great for grabbing a really quick bite on the go, or to take home.   Also, I have to sing praises of the unwich. Believe me, I love bread so much. It's the staple of the culinary world, in my opinion, but the unwich makes for something extra special. Just a tons of iceberg lettuce wrapped around whichever delectable combination you like. Perfection. So light, crunchy and easy.   Thanks, Jimmy John's!"}
{"text":"Overpriced sandwiches.  Not very tasty.  For fast food could be much better.  There thing seams to focused on delivery.  Spend less on that and make better quality meals."}
{"text":"New location opened up! Still super new and clean, the staff are professional and quick and the sandwiches are your average Jimmy Johns sandwiches but still good."}
{"text":"I called to place an order for delivery. When the guy at the store answered the phone I told him I would like to place an order for delivery. He asked if I wanted to place the order over the phone with him or online? Why would I call the store and tell him that I wanted to place an order for delivery if my intent was in any way to place my order online. What a moron!  I'll have nothing thanks!    1:00 PM.  January 8 2015"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. It's sooooo freaking good. I took away a star due to the fact that the cashier seemed like she was annoyed/impatient, even though I knew what I wanted to get right away.  Anyhow, decided to go for the original beach club sandwich, without switching up anything just to see what the taste is like on its own. It's pretty darn good, needless to say! Everything tasted fresh, and I love me some CRISP sprouts in a sub, anytime. Like its name, the beach club reminded me of being back in California, enjoying a great, refreshing sub... Except they don't have any JJ's in California nearby my hometown. lol!  Also, this was my first time ever having Jimmy John's. My cousin kept raving about it to me when I was in Washington state this past summer and I originally thought they didn't have any in Vegas until I stumbled upon it on yelp! I'm sure glad I found this little gem -- it's sort of hard to notice this particular location even if you live around the area. I'm definitely going to try and come here more often. :) Move over, Subway -- JJ's is leading the way!"}
{"text":"This Jimmy John's got my order wrong for the third time this last weekend. Adding mayo when I clearly asked for plain numerous times. This was the last chance I'm giving this location. So frustrating."}
{"text":"I'd say this place is just ok, I used to eat here quite often until they decided to get rid of their fresh sprouts......the sub just isn't the same without it :("}
{"text":"Worst ever. Love JJ and this place has messed up our order and taken over an HOUR to deliver the last 3 times we've ordered from them. Their customer service is awful. I called to ask where they were after and hour and he offered to cancel my order. That's it. Not even an apology. Bad service. Bad everything."}
{"text":"Good size sub, good taste and super quick service so how could you go wrong"}
{"text":"WE LOVE JIMMY JOHN'S.  I have been to a variety of sub shops, and this one TAKES THE CAKE.  The staff is always friendly, it takes them less than one minute to make your sandwich, and the bread is never anything less than fluffy and delicious.    Between my husband and I, I think we've had every sandwich on the menu, and we've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Well staffed, and nice staff, but the Slim 2 I ordered was basically a thin folded up slice of roast beef on a thickish roll. That was disappointing. If that's par for the course from JJ then there's no reason to ever eat at any JJ location."}
{"text":"I love JJ but this location just isn't up to par. I always get a veggie unwich, no mayo, add avocado. They sure don't forget to up charge for the extra avocado but they always forget to put it on my sandwich! Always. The receipt is always right. Maybe they should slow down just enough to read the order correctly."}
{"text":"Went and to get subs and employee said that we don't have enough bread to make 5 subs.  Then why are they open"}
{"text":"I work within a mile of this location and have ordered delivery many times. Every time I order food from this location something goes wrong. I've had to wait longer than expected, gotten someone else's food, had chips missing, etc. However, my most recent interaction with this location is what made Jimmy Johns lose yet another customer. I ordered my food well before my break at work knowing that this location takes longer to deliver. It took an hour and a half to arrive! I find this unacceptable. Upon waiting, I called the location to see what was taking so long. The girl who answered the phone let me know it was on its way and hung up. She did not apologize, nor did she even ask for my name or order number. Terrible customer service. To top it off, when I finally received my sandwich, there was loose change thrown in the bottom of the delivery bag. This both disgusted and confused me, causing me to trash my food all together. Also, the corporate comment page on the Jimmy Johns website doesn't work, so there's no way to notify them of the horrible service (unless you're posting on here)."}
{"text":"Seriously, who doesn't love JJ's? Helpful staff and fast service, not to mention the best tasting sandwiches."}
{"text":"OK Jimmy John's is the best of the chain sub shops i will give you that. WAAAAAY above Subway and not even in the same planet as quiznos. Jimmy Johns...better period. Not great but better. Now  the service..it is a sandwich shop do not expect much and you will not be dissapointed. I would prefer a bitchy person making the better sandwich rather than a sweet person making a crappy sandwich....you decide. Good service NEVER overcomes garbage food....get it Subway. I will go to a NY deli and get screamed at from the moment you walk in for the quality sandwich...it is part of the experience......Honey dripped BS from Subway employees still equals a shitty sandwich ."}
{"text":"Tyler brad and Vanessa are the dream team here! Don't let the reviews tell u else wise when they are in shift. To the point and helpful staff. Sucks a bunch of drunk Scottsdale people have to say something else. Very sweet and great service :)"}
{"text":"As far as sandwich shops go, this is a good option. They move quickly with their service and everyone was so polite. It was my first time going there in awhile and the cashier was very enthusiastic about explaining how to order and how everything comes. Majority of their subs come as 8\" subs. You have options regarding the bread. It's cold sandwiches only but they are generous with the meat, you don't have to beg them for a proper portion. Also, you can buy their Italian bread, day old, for just fifty cents. Also, they deliver within a 10 minute radius which makes it a great option for lunchtime at work or even a late dinner at home."}
{"text":"When it's late night and I don't want to wait around for pizza delivery I order JJ's.  Generally they are the fastest food delivery in Kent.  Every once in awhile I get a slow delivery, but it's not the norm. The bread is chewy which I love, and the meats are delicious. The roast beef is my favorite which is served medium rare. Yum!  They also deliver drinks, chips, and giant cookies!"}
{"text":"This Jimmy Johns is the cleanest  sandwich  shop i have ever seen. I go there three times a week because the team is friendly and  quick. There  whole wheat and sub bread is baked daily . I recommend  the italian or there tuna. F the guy about a straw what a +×××¥"}
{"text":"Nice employees but this is without a doubt the slowest, worst jimmy johns I've ever been to. I hate being a dickhead and leaving bad reviews but something needs to be done about this place. Very nice location and nice on the inside but wow. Anything but \"freaky fast\""}
{"text":"#8 Billy Club w/hot peppers.  Is there a better sandwich on the market?  I think not.  Fresh bread, vegetables & meat make for an award winning sub.  Freaky Fast service!  I love this place."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is an OK sandwich shop. It's not like other chains where you go down the line and pick your toppings, so I think that helps with the speediness of receiving your order. I had a hard time finding this place because the store front does not face the parking lot so be advised of this.   When I finally made it in, I was quickly greeted by a friendly cashier who proceeded to take my order. I told her I wanted the Gargantuan sandwich and then made it a combo by adding a drink. Jimmy John's gives you your choice of a cookie, chips or a drink to make your meal into a combo. By the time I was done paying, my sandwich was already ready. Talk about fast service! The Gargantuan is a HUGE sandwich, hence the name. They take their homemade french bun and pile it high with genoa salami, smoked ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey and provolone cheese. Then they add lettuce, tomato, onions, mayo and Italian dressing. I found my sandwich to be a bit dry. They need to add more mayo and more dressing, especially on a large sandwich that has so many items. The sandwich is super filling and I almost packaged up half of it for later, but I decided to go full glutton and eat the whole thing. Oh yes I did.  Yelp 2015 Review #12"}
{"text":"We finally got a Jimmy John's and I had heard so much about it being great.  We tried two different sandwiches (the No 9 Italian Night Club on their great french roll and the No 12 Beach Club on  thick sliced 7 grain bread).  Great quality product, great bread, very competitive pricing.  It is a little noisy with the music and hard surfaces in this location thou.  They are a brand new location so that will probably change (hope) over time."}
{"text":"I ordered three sandwiches to go and when I got home, I discovered that two of them were not what I had ordered- they were both completely different sandwiches containing ingredients against our dietary restrictions. I called the store to explain what had happened, and initially they were refusing to offer a refund, or even the sandwiches I had actually ordered! After plenty of arguing, the manager offered to replace my sandwiches if I drove back to the store- he refused to have them delivered to my house, since my order was placed in store and not delivery. Am I expected to unwrap my sandwiches in the store when I'm handed the bag to ensure that my order is actually correct?! It's ridiculous that I'm expected to drive back to the store and waste my time and gas, just for their incompetence. I am amazed how this subpar customer service is deemed acceptable.   Those two sandwiches went uneaten. I will not be returning to Jimmy John's in the future. This is no way to treat a customer."}
{"text":"Had the Gargantuan, awesome sandwich!  Filled with all your favorite Italian cold cuts, cheese, mayo, lettuce.   Bread was soft and toasty, perfect!  The workers at the front were friendly, but not annoying.  My only complaints are not having healthier alternatives to chips and the fact I shelled out $11 for the sandwich, drink, and chips."}
{"text":"I usually love this place, but today, I waited an especially long time to get my sub AND there was no avocado on my beach club, the MAIN reason I always get this sub :( I found this out once I was already back at work."}
{"text":"They live up to the freaky fast service. I got my sandwich before I could even pay for it. Very good sandwich, fresh, good price, super friendly service and did I mention fast?"}
{"text":"This place is the worst place ever.  They give you the wrong sandwiches and short you sandwiches then call you a lier. The manager Michael is very rude.  I will never eat there again.  He has no customer service."}
{"text":"I would've given this place a 4 or even a 5 if the staff changed up their attitude a bit it threw me off. Don't get me wrong service was extremely quick almost looked like the sandwich was pre made but it wasn't. Walked in and was greeted normally with a \"hi welcome\" since it was my first time here I walk up to a girl on the counter and asked what's your favorite or the customer favorite at this place. She gives a sly attitude and says oh the menu is above you and you can order over to the next counter. I tell her I was just asking what the favorites are since it's my first time here, she replies with the cashier should be able to help you. Dumbfounded as why she couldn't just answer a simple question I walk over to the cashier and ask her the same question. She helped me through the menu and recommended a couple of items. I ended up getting the number 9 with chips and drinks the number 9 is called the Italian night club. It is made with salami, capicola, smoked ham and provolone cheese, topped with L-T-O, mayo and house made vinaigrette. Sat down to eat, and after I finished I yelled out thank you to the staff and i over hear a girl say thank you have a nice day \"again\" I just laughed, I guess they weren't expecting me to sit and eat, but take my food to go and eat in my car ?! But anyways the food is good, made quick, but man change the attitude. The food can taste like crap but if you give one of the best customer service the taste of food wouldn't matter as much because you distract the guest with kindness."}
{"text":"I love their subs....BUT this location the staff is very uninviting.  I took my sub back to have it cut in half..wow I guess I put a damper in his day..will find another jimmy johns."}
{"text":"I have only been to jimmy johns a few times.  Once was delivered and the other two were a walk in. Today I went there for lunch with a co worker.  They were so focused on doing everything so \"freaky fast\" that their customer service sucks super bad.  I liked getting my food quick as I only get a half hour lunch but courteous service is a must.  This location isn't pleasant and there was so much mayo all over the outside of my wrapper that it was everywhere.  They hand you your sandwich with a receipt instead of a napkin.  Maybe I don't understand.  Shouldn't you hand me a napkin if you have smeared mayo all over the outside of the wrapper?  3 stars cuz the sand which was typical jimmy johns which is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Worst location ever!  They've gotten my order wrong twice.  The only plus is the delivery drivers are really nice.  However, whoever makes the sandwiches should take the time to carefully read the order request!  PS It's crazy that the company is known for being fast but this location takes 45 minutes to deliver food. (I live 3 minutes from the location)"}
{"text":"I have waited 12 freaking years for a Jimmy Johns to show up in Phoenix! Finally! Once I had somebody hand carry it down from Chicago, and the other time I drove 2 hours down to Tucson for it. Ok so I'm a little nuts over JJs. The Italian club is awesome and the Hunter's Club is just as good. The bread is just so good. Subway bread is absolute crap compare to this. Not sure why people are whining about the price. $5.25 for a large sub and $4.25 for a small club. That's pretty dang good for this day and age. Highly recommend the Italian. It is so good! If you'd rather go to subway, you have no taste buds."}
{"text":"Very disappointed by this location. First time ordering a delivery for myself and my location is only 0.8miles away from their store. I ordered my sub at 11:29am and didn't receive it until 12:07pm, to be exact. The delivery guy was very kind and apologize for the wait which I appreciated, and still gave him a tip. But to my surprise once I sat down to eat my sub I noticed it wasn't made to my order. Won't be a returning customer to this location unfortunately."}
{"text":"I personally like Jimmy Johns, but I also like about any sub shop.  In general no matter which location the sandwiches are always about the same.  Staff can definitely vary depending on location and time.  JJ's generally is quick to get your sandwich out.  This isn't a 5 star restaurant by any means so don't expect great customer service.  Expect a quick, efficient sandwich.  The wife and I will pick up a sandwich and sneak into the movies at times so location serves our needs at times."}
{"text":"Ok first time here or actually ordering online. Ordering online is nice and it was fast. I opted to pick up our subs since we are five minutes away. So I got there and the guys were nice. My subs were already done when I got there. So I got home and my wife and I opened our sandwiches, wow what a disappointment. First impression, pathetic excuse for a sub. I looked at my wife's sub,\"The Pepe\" and it had one thin slice of ham barely any lettuce or onion which she asked for. Seriously it had like two rings of onion. The sub is supposed to come with provolone and it didn't even have it on there. Also asked for Dijon mustard and again a swing and a miss. My sub, \"The Vito\" was ok at best. We won't be ordering from here again. It doesn't seem like you get your money's worth or even an accurately made sub. My wife and I will opt for Firehouse Subs. So much better in our opinion. But hey the chips are good.  Oh our order for two 8\" subs and two bags of chips came to $14.59. Spend a few more dollars and go to Firehouse subs..."}
{"text":"Holy balls. By the time you have the order out your mouth, they have the sandwich in your hands. So quick!!  The sandwiches are great for a student budget. The bread is extra soft and delicious. In fact, sometimes I just get the day old bread for some noshing.   But since I've discovered Dave's cosmic subs, I can't help but find jimmy johns a little bland and heavy on the mayo. You can always order it without the mayo, but then you really have no flavor at all."}
{"text":"You know what? Jimmy John's makes a doggone good sandwich!! This sub shop opened near my job a little while ago, and I finally had the opportunity to try it out. My office sent me to place an order for 8 subs, which I came back to pick up a few hours later. JJ's had all of the orders correct and labeled with everyone's name. The employees were very friendly and polite, and the restaurant itself was spotless.   When I bit into my sub... WOW! The first thing I noticed was the delicious bread! I think I could have eaten just the bread and have been perfectly happy. The rest of the sub was just as good. The meat and fixings were fresh and tasty, and it wasn't skimpy at all. True, it might not be a foot long, but I thought it was a good value for the money.  The fact that they deliver is a bonus as well.  While I do prefer my sandwiches warm (I wish they offered that as an option), I was perfectly happy with my #11 from JJ's and will return!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great sandwiches and you can buy their \"day old bread\" to make you own sandwich at home.   The really do have \"freaky fast service\" both in-store and delivery. The staff is always very friendly too and they have really reasonable prices on their sandwiches.   Add hot peppers to any sub for an extra kick!"}

{"text":"This will be the fifth and last week I try to bring an oven into your establishment to toast people's subs for a nominal additional fee so they don't have to eat cold subs and if you kick me out again I will accept your decision and start my own business called Johnny Jim's next door.  I even picked out a slogan: \"Johnny Jim's: where patience is rewarded with a warm sub and a warm heart. Not as freaky or fast but still a Sub.\" (That's a tentative slogan.)  It's just business this was never personal. Hence the 5 Stars. Good luck in your future endeavors and your freaky fastness."}
{"text":"I've tried Jimmy John's twice now, and both times I've been disappointed. Although I have a masochistic streak now and then, I'm not going to give it a third try--too much pain for me!  Visit one:  good sandwich, lots of food for the price, relatively quick, but no ice and soda was warm. In the summer in Phoenix, cold soda is kind of a basic need. And they didn't say anything about this until I had already bought a soda. I would have wanted to know in advance that I was about to drink lukewarm soda on a 110 degree day. But things happen and I needed a quick lunch to bring back to the office, so I thought I would try them again today. Bad idea.  Visit two:  stood in line to order for 10 minutes. No movement at all. I counted 11 people working behind the counter, but no one taking orders for some reason. I should have left, but I decided to double-down and wait a bit more. When they finally took my order, the woman behind the counter muttered something about their meat slicer being broken since yesterday, so they were running out of things. Really? Um, get a new slicer if your business depends on it, like this one does. I ordered a sandwich right off the menu, then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes for my sandwich. Actually, I got mad when other people who just walked in were getting their sandwiches, and I had to \"reorder\" by yelling my sandwich order to the people making the sandwiches. No apology ever for the 20 minute wait. I wasn't the only customer wondering what was going on today--I suspect that Jimmy John's lost a fair share of goodwill with a lot of people.  There are now plenty of good places to eat in downtown Phoenix, and I will now frequent them instead. It's too bad that Jimmy John's can't get its act together, because the sandwiches are decent.  My lunch equation:  Decent sandwiches + crappy service = I'm not returning"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Too cool staff that can't be bothered. I ordered the veggie sandwich and the amount of avocado on it was so sad...like half a teaspoon spread over the entire sandwich. My boyfriend really liked the giant sandwich though, the one full of meat. Peppers are really good, but for the price I feel like it should be included. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is the worst location in the entire Las Vegas. I ordered a turkey unwich, the staff which called herself the manager made me the unwich with only 2 pieces of small lettuce that wasn't even big enough to wrap around the meat and other stuff inside, so pretty much while eating this the cucumbers and tomatoes could be falling out, so I went back inside just for her to argue with me and said that's how it's suppose to be but ended up agreeing to make me another one. I waited for about 5-10 minutes, went back inside asked if it was ready just to find out she wasn't even making my unwich but she was making other customers sandwiches that came after me. At that time I asked for a refund, as soon as I asked she pushed the sandwich that she was making rolled her eyes and said what? To me with an attitude. Then I got the owner Sam's number to call and let him know what just happened, his response was so rude and careless \"so what do you want me to do about it?\" And said \"go make bad reviews on Yelp  please do! Bye!\"  I'm very shocked how careless this owner is about his business and how bad customer service skills this so called manager have. I recommend any other jimmy johns location except for this one."}
{"text":"It's ok. I don't like how the bread is cold and they don't have jalapeños to add to your sub I was really upset the other day when my husband wanted a sub on whole wheat and it turns out their whole wheat is BREAD and not a sub roll!! What??? Who does that?? Fortunately he is pretty laid back and was cool with it but I was pissed. Don't think we will be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"We ordered our food 3 hours ago, it never came . We called them and he said it would be free. Well it's been 4 hours and still no food. If you're in a hurry don't call this JJ . I know I won't call them and be lied to. High price, no service. What a waste of time. This JJ sucks."}
{"text":"Great service and very fast!  Delivery for locals. I love the Beach Club Unwich with guacamole and turkey. My kids love the Slim 1 and its large enough they can both split it."}
{"text":"This location is not my fave. Jimmy johns is good and suppose to be known for super fast. I order my food online to be delivered. We waited 45 mins for it to be delivered. I honestly don't know why it took forever. I love down the street and the guy didn't acknowledge the wait or anything."}
{"text":"Super fast delivery! Bread was a little chewier than usual.. and i still think prices are bit on the high side, but I do love the italian night club!"}
{"text":"I love jimmy johns! I have yet to have a bad sandwich here. They just did a remodel a few months ago and the restaurant it big and airy. I never see anyone in there though. Whenever I go there I'm the only one. Makes my service fast."}
{"text":"They will not sub anything.  I'm so upset cause my eating habits are very picky.  Will not come here again. Really u will not change the shredded lettuce for whole lettuce. So not happy."}
{"text":"WOW. Read 2 pg's of reviews of this JJ's location and can count the good ones on one hand. 1.) Early after this store opened, thought it'd just need to work out some kinks: Such as, no bag for takeout. Unsanitary.   2.) Then, shortly after: not only no bag for takeout, no napkins (shortsighted franchisee & mgt. obv. would rather keep overhead at bare-bones, than satisfy hungry repeat customers),   3.) In Feb. (I used to frequent this store weekly) I became quite sick from soured, lettuce.  Surely food poisoning, much like another reviewer. Didn't go to this JJ's (or any other) again.   4.) Wife went yesterday through drive-thru (3 sandwiches purchased). To our pleasant surprise, we were provided a bag and 3 napkins.  However, she also ordered 3 loaves of day-old bread ($.50/each- great value from the chain!). She was told NO. The limit on day-old bread purchases is TWO.  Unbelievable.   Lost our business forever. A shame- I used to eat at the original JJ's in Charleston, IL while attending EIU (1983). Jimmy himself made our delicious sandwiches back then.  Bummer. I've also written their corporate people with this very same explanation."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating @ Jimmy John's and I must say, The sandwich was well worth the dollar (grand opening special) I paid for it but I would not pay $4.50 for it @ retail price. save your money and go to subway or heidie's deli. you will get more bang for your buck! the only reason I give it any starts is because the girls that work there are hotties!"}
{"text":"This was my first time l stop on for lunch if your a meat lover you will have to pay for extra of meat, but Jimmy John's will give you plenty of lettuce enough for a side salad the hoagie tasty good all in all because of the bun."}
{"text":"I love their subs but I'm writing this review for something other than their food. I don't typically Yelp outside of traditional dining, but I was truly wowed tonight. I avoid a public restroom in fast food as much as I can but I couldn't wait. As I'm in the restroom, I look around and realize how clean the restroom is. The faucets and plumbing clean and shiny. The floors have no grey build up, debris in corners or dirty grout. The mirror is clean. Walls clean. Sink and toilet clean and without hard water build up. The floor edges even have a piece of decorative metal....shiny. Could not believe my eyes. As a director of the hospitality division of a large cleaning company in the valley, I of course came out asking who cleans their facility. I had every intention of recruiting that team. Guess what wowed me more? The EMPLOYEES clean the restrooms and are trained in doing it right. In the commercial cleaning industry it is unheard of to have a clean restroom that employees cleaned. I thought they were pulling my leg but after asking prying questions I realized they really do clean the restroom.   They should be proud. I clean high end resorts and that restroom was just as clean....and at the end of the night. Unbelievable. Thank you for caring about the health of your guests in every way!"}
{"text":"I ordered a SUB sandwich and got a CLUB sandwich online, didn't notice till I got to work. Oh well"}
{"text":"So much for freaky fast. We ordered 43 minutes ago and are still waiting... I just called and was told \"the driver should be on his way\". Finally showed up 46 minutes later, as we are about to walk out the door to leave."}
{"text":"The only better BLT than the JJBLT is your momma's.   Crusty, crunchy french bread, a thick layer of mayo, 8 hearty slices of bacon, shredded lettuce, and tomato slices make this staple sandwich a win in my book.   I'm normally disappointed in any sub style BLT I order because the bread overwhelms the measly portion of bacon and I feel like I'm eating a lettuce and tomato sandwich with bacon bits here and there.   But the JJBLT is where I can get my fix without incurring grease scars from frying my own bacon (seriously, does anyone have tips not to get splatter damage on my hands and wrists?!) .   This is not a spot to head to for a late night munchie as they unfortunately close pretty early (9pm) which is why they are docked a star.   They do however, deliver AND have a drive through which tickles my lazy bone's fancy. You can also call ahead and have your order ready, but considering they can put your sandwich together in about 47 seconds, it's not necessary.  I work odd hours which allows me to frequent businesses during their off hours, so the times I've been here are never during lunch or dinner rushes, so I couldn't tell you how quick they are when there's more than one or two people ordering.    The decor is standard JJ's, funny and punny placards placed all about, open and airy.  Don't leave without getting a few loafs of day old bread for $0.50. I always pick up a few for garlic cheesey bread, crustinis, bread pudding, or anything I would need not sliced bread for."}
{"text":"Just found out recently that they raised their sandwich prices $1.25 due to the mandatory wage increase.  This is on top of the $1.00 additional cost to order a sandwich to be delivered.  In the past, it was hard to justify paying $10 for a sub (i'd tip the driver $2), I just paid for speed and convenience I guess.  Our large office is right down the street and we are a big customer for JJ's.  Word is going around the office and people aren't happy.  I for one won't be ordering from them anymore and I know others here will follow.  You're pricing yourself out of the market at this point.  With the so-so quality and inconsistency of your subs, I wish you the best..."}
{"text":"Second time I have ordered as of late and ordered off my favorite list and my son has gotten lettuce on his sandwich. These sandwiches are not cheap and shredded lettuce is not easy to scrap off. It seems unfair to wait 37 minutes for a meal for it to be wrong. Ticket # 23440238 Then I decide to put in a complaint online and guess what? Three attempts to be taken to an error 404 screen. A lot of good that was."}
{"text":"Not the best all around score....  On my visit today to JimmyJohns, I would score them.....    The Sandwich I would give 7 out of 10. It had a good balance of inerds to bread, just enough mayo and such - no napkins though. The drink was a simple fountain drink - and it cost almost 2.00 for a serve-yourself? -too expensive, period.  Soda don't cost THAT much, c'mon! The bag of chips....uh, best description as, 'saugy'...no crunch and bendable??? NO, not the potato chips!   The service too was less than optimal... the cashier has a problem rolling his eyes at things he doesn't like....however, the fella making the sandwiches was very polite and accommodating.   It's been a very long time since I've been there, just across the street from my employer. It's going to be some time before I go back again....quite a while, if at all...."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's has quality sandwiches. The bread is amazing (if fresh) which really sets it apart from subway. I'm only giving it three stars because the bread has not always been fresh when I've eaten there and the sandwiches are a bit overpriced in my opinion. Still, it's a solid sandwich joint."}
{"text":"Choices are limited. I did like their bread.  They use a fair amount of mayo . I had their turkey with bacon . The amount of meat was average  but the sanwich with the cabbage tasted good Ser ice was average"}
{"text":"Do not waste your time here. Delivery takes over an hour, every time I walk in, there seems to be an entirely new, and untrained staff, no clear managerial staff present."}
{"text":"This jimmy johns is the best one I've been to, just because the fast service and how friendly the people are here! I just went in today and ordered a Vito #5 and they always know how to make it perfect and fast so I'm in and out so I can make it to work on time! Thank you for that! I give you guys 5 stars for the good work you guys do here!"}
{"text":"I wish I can give this place 0 stars! Beware!! I placed a delivery order, gave them my name and address with all necessary info.. Including name of place of business... I waited 45 min... No delivery so I decide to give them a call and see what was going on with my order. They said it was out for delivery.. Which by now should have arrived. I say thank you and wait another 15 min. Totaling 1 hour! I call back and they say it has been delivered.. Long story short, they acknowledged they delivered to the wrong address(which is next door) and offered to make me a new order. I tell them I've waited long enough I just want my cc refunded. They put me on hold to get the manager..named NICK he answers and says that I would have to wait till tmw because there isn't a manager in. Wait... I thought he was the manager. I say fine... I wait two days, no refund so I call back and ask for the manager, to which they put NICK on the phone again.he says he refunded the money back to my cc but still I have not yet seen a credit and it's been 4 days.. Terrible customer service and the manager(NICK) can't decide whether he wants to manage or hide from customers.The worst customer service ever. Don't waste your time or money at this establishment. Definitely not worth the headache. I'm still waiting for my refund for food I never received!"}
{"text":"Solid sandwiches and fast service. Great to get in and out with a group. Go with the beach club, tasty."}
{"text":"Generally I like Jimmy John's quite a bit. The sandwiches, for the price you're paying, plus the speed at which you get them make them ideal for a quick lunch pickup when you're on the run. That being said, when the cleanliness of the establishment is questionable, it makes me think twice about eating there. In the case of this particular Jimmy John's a pervading mildew-like smell hits me every time I walk in this place. If I had to guess, I'd say it was the water/cleaning product solution and the old rags and/or mops they use to clean the place (or stink up, as the case may be.) The result is a pungent sour smell which permeates then entire shop. Needless to say, I have no interest in eating at a place that smells this bad. Also, in case you're wondering, no, this was not a one-time occurrence. I used to visit this JJ quite often until the smell got so bad it made me lose my desire to ever eat here again."}
{"text":"Had to find some quick for lunch near work.  Coworkers suggested we do Jimmy John!  I grabbed their roast beef and turkey sandwich.  Of course I like a lot of meat.  Sandwich was very nicely done.  The roast beef of course felt better than the stuff you get from subway.  I did wish that I could get a different bread like how subway does it.  But this bread was alright and I kind of wish it was toasted.    It's quick and convience for me.  I def will come back and perhaps give it another shot or another type of sandwich."}
{"text":"As great as their subs may be, they certainly aren't my favorite choice. When in the store, except great service. As for deliveries- there's nothing freaky fast about it! When a pizza delivery seems faster, you're doing something wrong. Serioisly, guys: 25-40 minutes for Jimmy Johns?! How bout no."}
{"text":"OMG.  Just got their turkey sandwich.  Again, got prompt delivery.  The sandwich was perfect.  That's the only way I can describe it.  And the huge dill pickles as a side dish are really crisp and yummy.  Someday I'll have to actually go to their shop and see what it's like."}
{"text":"I worked here for a month and a half.  This place isn't what it's cracked up to be.  The place is clean, I will give it that, but it's definitely not my go to place for sandwiches.  They only offer cold sandwiches and the quality isn't that great.  I'd go other places."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that my hubbs really liked jimmy johns. I believe he ate here for a bulk of the time he was working in phoenix. I'm not certain if it was due to the inexpensive cost, or the quality of the food here.   I had tried it once, it was a sandwich that housed a variety of deli meats, easy on the sauce and some lettuce.  I'll admit the sandwich was decent, meaty and good chew on the bread, but definitely isn't something I'd crave.  Nonetheless, he enjoyed so I didn't mind stopping by to give it a try."}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Took good care of us figuring out our sandwich choices. Always great sandwiches too."}
{"text":"Eh... they're close to my house so I order from them pretty frequently. I used to work at a JJ's in Flagstaff so I know it's overpriced but I'm lazy lol. It's a Russian roulette if they actually get my order right. It's more often wrong than right. I usually only ever ask for no lettuce, which is apparently too hard to read lol. I get that the job sucks and it's minimum wage, so whatever. But when I worked there my managers would be all over us if we did even the tiniest thing wrong. I guess the standards aren't the same here."}
{"text":"There was a DEAD BUG in my bread. Yes, a DEAD BUG. the one girl that works there (who actually made my sandwich that day) always ALWAYS has a sour attitude.  If you don't like your job, quit and get a new one!!!"}
{"text":"I always choose between here and DP Dough right around the corner. It usually comes down to whether I want to eat healthy or not.  This Jimmy Johns is exceptionally fast if you order in store. More often then not, my sandwich is handed to me before my change is. Delivery is fast as well. Not as fast obviously, but still \"freaky fast\".  Customer service is great. People always seem to be happy and friendly.  I'm a regular here and have never had any bad experiences. I'm also a huge fan of the taste of their sandwiches in general, but this is by far my favorite Jimmy Johns to go in to and order."}
{"text":"Although the food was what you would typically expect, Jimmy Johns is known for being freaky fast. Unfortunately that is not the case with this location."}
{"text":"I stopped here at 9:00 on a Saturday night. Walked in and was instantly told \"there system was down\" and it was cash only. So I had to walk next door to Chase to get cash and went back to Jimmy Johns. I ordered the standard #14 with NO mayo and a slim 4 and chips. My total was $12 something so I gave them $15.00 and told them to keep the change. When I got home 20 minutes later the slim 4 was correct, but they gave me a #7 WITH mayo. This location is a joke and I won't be returning. Next time I need food around this area I'll just go to McDonald's across the street."}
{"text":"I'm in a wheelchair and this establishment has no handicap accessible/ friendly features. No handicap doors, bathroom, or tables. This is a huge disappoint considering on large the brand is. Then add in the establishment is across the street from a hospital  ( literally ) and surrounded by doctors offices. Unexpectable for such a large brand and it's demographics of the area."}
{"text":"Love to order from this location! I the ordered online at 12:35, for delivery, and had the sandwich in my hands at 12:44. Freakishly fast! They must have known how hungry I was!!! #nomnomnom"}
{"text":"Good customer service with extremely fast delivery. Definitely going back. I love their vegi sub, every bite has freshness on it"}
{"text":"DELIVERY!  Whoa.. that is freaky fast delivery!  I just moved back to Charlotte in Piedmont Row - and I was busy unpacking boxes. I didn't have any food in the house yet - and didn't want to leave or order a pizza...  I used their iphone app to place an order and they were here in less than 20 minutes with the sandwich and chips just the way I customized it.   I love when things are simple and easy. (Well.. not when it comes to people... but food delivery... yes)  Always good to know that I don't have to leave my house or even make my own sandwiches if I don't want to.. thanks Jimmy John.. whoever you are...  Try the Beach Club, but add hot peppers and extra cucumbers! Get a kosher dill and some thinny chips.."}
{"text":"I think they put crack in their sandwiches because I actually crave these dang things.  I'll be honest, the meat isn't like the top-notch kind you find in a nice deli, but I could care less because their sandwiches taste so yummy (currently addicted to the #4) Maybe it's the bread.  And whoever invented the drive-thru is genius and this one is faster than fast. Sometimes you order, drive up to the window and literally they hand you your food.   Any place that has me craving their food always deserves a 5-star rating.  Super Yum, but this one might be personal preference"}
{"text":"it's all about the bread. the bread i say.   and this is what makes Jimmy John's so FREAKING addicting. Their subs are nothing special, they don't really put organic meats and fillings, no, it's the bread. It's like crack in that bread, i could just eat it and feel content.   I always get the vito or a plain jim. all their subs are yum and you oughta try. yay that they've expanded but i want a jimmy john's closer to me coz i need to feed my addiction."}
{"text":"So there was a time when I had no idea who or what Jimmy John's was. I mean unless you're from the midwest or somewhere central I doubt coasters and those of us in between had ever heard of this awesome sub place. I'd like to think my encounter with Jimmy John's was fate... although through unusual circumstances, a story for another time ;-) my first try was a complimentary sample by a certain gentleman... well the thing is i kind of forgot his name... oops! That first time... I got to try the #5 Vito. It was a mouthful, he never told me it was that big, and so thick but my first bite into it I handled it like a champ, and I just kept on eating it and swallowing until it was all done, I was satisfied, and afterwards I made a mental note that I would return because I was craving more.   I've only had two menu items and that's the #5 and the #11 both delicious creations, I can't explain the bread, it's a white sub but it's really good. They don't toast it, I like the contrast of a cold loaf with a hot filling... in the end it's a good feeling. And the times they are open make them especially awesome! Phoenix now has become a late night city with a little more places open past 10p and I love Jimmy John's for that, now after a late night on mill ave and kinda buzzed from the tavern... I have choices other than the mill staples of Slices, the hot dog place, well basically the stretch of late night food places on 6th ave. Now I can walk to Jimmy's and grab a yum sub! So love ya and yes I'm a fan... thanks my mr.-stery  encounter for introducing me to Jimmy's... and I'll see ya again Jimmy John's for my #5!"}
{"text":"Tried to have Jimmy John's delivered tonight. Their delivery radius is so small that even being 1.34 miles away is too far for them. That must be how they have such fast delivery. They also lose customers quickly since they won't expand their delivery area. I'm sure another place will appreciate the business."}
{"text":"Location use to be across the street. Store is bigger with a lot more seating!  Now can go to lunch with co-workers or the family and dine in!  Love the Club Lulu with some avo and hot peppers."}
{"text":"Wow!! It's bad when subway can make a better sandwich... I would not recommend... Worst sandwich company n Las Vegas.."}
{"text":"Best JJs I've ever been to and I've been to A LOT! Freaky fast food, awesome chips (jalapeno and thinking are the best) and super delicious cookies. Get something with bacon or avocado or both :)"}
{"text":"5 stars all the way for the price and service. Food is excellent for the cost and there is a good menu of options. Service was fast in a busy environment and with a smile."}
{"text":"Fast service, okay sandwich, certainly over priced, better than Subway"}
{"text":"NOT HAPPY!!  They charge .50 for wheat when other Jimmy John;'s don't and they added ham to a #15 which I did not want and charged me $1.75 for same.  Very unresponsive to my displeasure."}
{"text":"Fresh, Cheap and leaves a great taste in your mouth hours later (unlike a lot of the dump eateries here in Scottsdale).  I just really find theirs subs a great way to enjoy lunch.  5 Stars."}
{"text":"I gave one star but i shouldn't have gave any. Horrible service. I paid $14 for sandwiches and id just like to say thanks for the BREAD.. I normally wouldn't mind paying anything for Jimmy Johns but being here today was completely disappointing. Dirty, disgusting and highly unprofessional. Never again.  I could go to subway and actually get what i pay for."}
{"text":"Great experience at JJ's. Adam and Stephen were kind and attentive and my sandwich was perfect! Thanks for hiring quality people who care about their job and their customers!"}
{"text":"I used to not like Jimmy Johns, then I liked it, but now I won't step foot in the restaurant.    I recently found out that the owner is a poacher and I can not and will not support that man!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing customer experience! I I always recieve great service by enthusiastic employees and get my food \"freaky fast\" and made perfectly to what I wanted. Very clean and organized store, definitely a satisfied customer."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! The owner is very friendly and personable. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. I am so excited that they opened one up in town, I sure complained enough to get them here. Subway can't even compare with them. Jimmy John's is the best!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here. I don't even need to tell them what I want. I have an extreme allergy to mayo, they automatically say we need to change gloves. Very nice and understanding about my issue. I have never had anyone be as accommodating as people here. Kudos to the staff."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Delivers very quick! Bread is made fresh and it's the best part of getting a sub. Reasonably priced and very fresh ingredients. In the Lakewood area? Craving a cold good sub? To lazy to leave the house? Definitely check them out!!! The only con is that if u do go to sit in or to pick up, the parking is tricky due to having a parking garage."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! When I come here in person not only is it fast service but it's quality food! Also when ordering over the phone or mobile app I get my food \"freaky fast\"! Defiantly continuing to eat here!"}
{"text":"Open late and have the best sandwich on mill. Come here all the time after the bars here and it's always good highly recommend"}
{"text":"Wish I could leave a negative or no star. I love Jimmy Johns- but NOT this location. I keep trying to give them the benefit of the doubt and EVERY SINGLE TIME it takes an hour or longer- NOT Freaky Fast. This last order- they called and said they ran out of wheat bread and would take a bit longer- after almost an hour I called and was told the bread takes 3 hours! What?!?!! I asked them why it was always so slow- and he replied- \"Would you like to cancel your order?\" This was a 4 sandwich order with sides and my co workers were starving at this point- but I said yes because I was sure he would spit on our food for complaining. NEVER NEVER NEVER Again. Sorry Jimmy John"}
{"text":"Looked forward to trying something new because I've never been in a Jimmy John's. I must say, most disappointing. First of all, I have to rhetorically ask about the so-called \"gourmet\" ingredients. That's how one of the reviewers here on Yelp said about this place. Sure, the bread is better quality than Subway but is that what you call gourmet? I ordered my sandwich with brown mustard instead of mayonnaise but it came dry.   Very uncomfortable, I must say, was the fact that the manager was standing in the restaurant and telling a story to one of his employees (and me) about his experience trying to fire another one of his employees. It was a terrible experience listening in on this gossip and also seeing the manager talking about the whole thing in a gossipy way. Worse, the interior of this building is hard surfaces so his booming voice was echoing all over the place. Sorry, I am going back to Subway; Jimmy John's bread just isn't that good."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot when I was a lazy ass and didn't want to make dinner for myself and the miss....so I would pick it up to go.   Only lame part is that they can't take cheese from one sandwich, and put it on another one. Malarkey. I don't want my provolone, so take it off of my sandwich and put it on hers. Oh...you can't? False. Do it. Still no? Fine. You make a damn good sandwich.  Also...LBI. Don't know LBI? It stands for Leave Bread In...tell them and they won't scoop out the bread.  Right, Audrey B.?! LBIIIIII!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's! The bread is always perfect. This location gets really busy and there isn't much room to sit and eat, but the staff working there moves pretty fast.   I always order the Turkey Tom, even they are usually out of the alfalfa sprouts. But no big deal.  One thing to note: this location DOES NOT deliver. My office is located less than 2 miles away on Charleston and they said that's too far for delivery. They delivered to us once this summer, but after that they refused, even when we had a really big order."}
{"text":"Thank Gord for this Jimmy Jims. I was pulling into the Bonneville Transit Center on the bus having never been there before, looking around at the apparently no food anywhere near the station and was like \"fuuuuu\" ... started walking toward the closest sign of civilization, which appeared to be the Golden Nugget, when I saw this oasis hidden under city hall!  Standard JJ with the standard pricing, but there's nothing wrong with that.  Salute to those bike delivery guys, even if they don't go very far, doing that in the 105 degree weather for hours still ain't no easy dollar."}
{"text":"I went to college here, and this place was a staple of my diet.  The pepe was fantastic. I think I've had roughly 500 of these in my tenure at U of Illinois!  Jimmy John's S.F., anyone?"}
{"text":"It not often come too JJ believe my second time. I have ALWAYS been fan! It toss up between JJ and Capriotti comes too my favorite subs/sandwiches. Too me win win either way you choose!!  I order the Italian Night Club. Start with the bread because if the bread no good then forget about it. I love the bread it baked daily just like others but like nice crust too the outside and moist inside. Taste fresh! The freshness starts on outside straight too everything on the inside from the lettuce (other chains simple things lettuce, pickles, or tomatoes not taste as fresh or say pre package toppings), thinly sliced white onions, sliced tomatoes, and different sliced deli meat. Hot peppers and italian dressing, mayo, and all combines too awesome sub! I got bag of chips and soda. The chips its JJ brand. The bag of chips some tasty chips (they have four different flavors) got the barbeque. I love nice crunchy, lot of flavor, and who not like bag of chips with sub? The soda they have fountain so endless if dining in.  The restaurant is pretty small only five too six tables. They do have couple outdoor tables also although right now not the best idea. I enjoy the decor. It feeling of small time deli with all the different signs all over the place, even community event board that people put stuff up on, they have music playing inside, and open air very clean restaurant.  The service something that deserve five star woot woot! As soon as you walked in got greeted with warm welcome and smile. It small location but talk about fully staff had my order done before sit down got my drink. One of the workers asked about my Mariners baseball cap wearing finishing my lunch. We had a conversation about Seattle the city, baseball, and cool random conversation with one of the workers. Friendly staff and leaving they say thanks for coming and have good one.  I always been fan still fan and certain making more stop at JJ! =))))"}
{"text":"My fiance and I arrived and ordered our sandwiches (the receipt shows 5:26 pm on 8/12/2017.) My fiance asked if the Gargantuan was the largest sandwich on the menu, and the young female at the register (who by the way had several hickies on her neck) informed us she was new because she did not know the answer. She did have to ask twice what the question was because she could barely hear my fiance speaking; the music was too loud.   We observed the male co-worker who was counting his cash drawer; he was also controlling the music selection and the volume from his iPod. When she asked him a question about our order, he was too busy counting money to answer, BUT when the song was over he did not hesitate to put the money down to find another song.  We received our sandwiches \"Freaky Fast\" from another male employee. He was very personable, and our sandwiches (Gargantuan and BLT) were yummy.   We sat down in the corner booth furthest from the counter with our backs to the counter. At approximately 6:01 pm, the music volume was raised substantially...appropriate maybe for a backyard barbecue, but not appropriate for Jimmy John's Sandwich Shop. I proceeded to finish my sandwich while videotaping the window to record the volume of the music. (I have two recordings 6:01 pm and 6:08 pm.) My fiance got up to use the restroom, and at that time a female employee with long dark hair said, \"Where's everyone at?\" And walked out the front door. Moments later my fiance returned from the restroom, and we began to leave. The male employee who made our sandwiches was at the register, and he turned the volume down to thank us for coming in and told us to have a good evening.   While walking to our truck which was parked facing the west wall, we observed movement in the garbage dumpster area and could see that the left side of the gate was closed, but the right side was open. While getting in the car I could see someone peering through the opening between the gate and the brick. My fiance saw the female on her knees in front of someone who was standing up.  I'm writing our experience and what we observed to inform management and/or the franchisee owner, because I personally would not want this type of behavior going on in my establishment.  For the most part, the store is clean, and the sandwiches were made efficiently and quickly...that is the only reason why I am not giving Jimmy John's on 7th and Roosevelt one star."}
{"text":"My sanwich was average, nothing to speak about.  Not sure why they have tables in the resteraunt since they clearly don't want you to eat there.  There are no napkins, utensils or any kind of condiments available.  When you ask for them, the staff states that they don't have them.  C'mon, no napkins or s & p for your eat in \"guests\" a term I use loosely since they are not wecoming!  It's not as if they don't offer what every fast food in town does to keep cost down on there subs.  They more expensive than their equivelant sub par sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Great service at this location! I've ordered for delivery from this location 3 times within the past 4 months and each time was great. Delivery took 13 minutes to get to me. I order the Club Lulu with avocado added and tastes amazing every time!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight with my son. We went inside rather than the drive thru so I could take a look at the menu a little longer since this was my first time. We ordered, the associate was very polite and even helped me rearrange the order a bit to save me some money. I paid and went to fill up our drinks, before I could finish filling the first drink the food was done. I was definitely caught off surprise how quick it was. But I was thrilled b/c there is nothing worse waiting for food with a hungry two year old getting antsy. I didn't realize until I got home that their slogan was about making it fast. Well very well suited! I am so excited they have a drive thru (with said 2 year old it is so difficult sometimes to go into a restaurant and get food). I really don't want to get unhealthy fast food so now I have a very good option for a very quick meal without getting out of the car. Oh and on top of all that the food is really good. It's simple, nothing flashy but it's good. The bread was really good! My whole family will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"First time to Jimmy Johns. Loved the idea behind the unwhich (sand which wrapped in lettuce). Had the beach club and really enjoyed it.    Other than the tad bit of unorganization with the sub making line (2 sandwhiches were made incorrectly, 1 was just not made) the service is very welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. I like loud music. Having gone to more live rock concerts than just about anyone. But today at this place, the music was so loud the employee's could not hear each other. I told the guy at the register, \"the music is a little loud isn't it\". He just stared at me and did not lower the music. Othe people came in and walked out. This place has gone down hill."}
{"text":"It's already been said here but I'm frustrated enough by my recent experience to post another review here to reiterate that these guys seriously suck at delivering sandwiches. If you order around mid day expect it to take an hour. I've eaten in at this location and it's fine. Whoever is running the delivery side of this location is a clown."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is a great if you want a decent sandwich fast.  I have stopped in to pick up lunch on the way to work and occasionally had it delivered.  I've always received my meal fast!"}
{"text":"Even though there are only two things on the menu that I can eat, they're damned tasty and the service is incredibly fast.  I am a bit surprised by all the five stars though, you people do realize that this is just a chain sandwich joint, right?"}
{"text":"So fucking stingy!!!!! I asked for extra everything and nothing. A slither of an onion and a few peppers 4 to be exact! If you don't like your fucking job why are you there?"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe my eyes witnessing the long line of customers being milled through their doors. For a sub/hoagie with such bland and tastelessness being commercialized on as \"Gourmet Sandwiches that's mother approved\" ...GIVE ME A FRIGGIN BREAK. As a foodie, I want flavor NOT cafeteria lunch line food. The people giving this 'stuff' 4 and 5 stars are the ones buying into these franchises... yelpers steer clear, do your research for original and unique before you're separated from your money."}
{"text":"Came in to grab a quick bite during a moving day and they were fast and on point! In and out within 20mins. Quick service everything tastes great"}
{"text":"Tiny little spot. They have a pretty spacious outdoor seating area though. They have all the anticipated offerings of a standard Jimmy Johns franchise. As per usual the Decour can be quirky and hilarious. My favorite thing to get is the veggie without the bun. And as advertised they are always super Duper fast"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! There's a bunch of cool stuff to read EVERYWHERE on the walls. There is outside seating with plenty of shade and plenty of space. Everyone was friendly and energetic when we walked in and the food came out unusually fast (as usual!) Great location!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I adore the delivery drivers. They're always so kind and truly make my day at work sometimes. I don't care if they're not 'freaky fast,' the kindness outweighs it all.   However, what it will never outweigh is the blatant lack of customer service the manager exhibits. I typically order Jimmy Johns about once a week and order a somewhat-specific sub, or as specific as you can get at a place with such a limited menu. Last week, the driver dropped off a sub that was the complete opposite of what I ordered. It wasn't that they gave me the wrong sub entirely, it was a poor attempt at what I'd asked for - missing things I'd added or should've been included on the sub to begin with, and added things I didn't want and extras I didn't even ask for.   I worked in food service for years so I get that this stuff happens all the time. So I simply called the store and asked for the manager to hopefully make amends. I get some young sounding woman who essentially tells me it'll be easier for them if I drive in to pick up a new sandwich, an eight minute drive from my office each way. I didn't want to battle, just wanted my sandwich, so I succumbed and took an unpaid break to pick up my sandwich.   I expected something, an apology, an explanation, a refund on the delivery fee I paid for, honestly ANYTHING but what I experienced when I walked in. I showed up with my screwed up sandwich in hand, and the woman who I presumed to be the manager looks at me, doesn't ask who I am or offer any explanation, pulls a sandwich out from under the register (wtf?), says 'Here. Thanks.' And walks away!! I was flabbergasted. I felt so disrespected, her customer service was the worst I've ever encountered, and she's supposed to be a manager??   I tried to contact corporate Jimmy Johns. I explained to them I'm not out for blood, just an explanation and at the very least a refund on my delivery fee. I've always tipped 20-25% and truly wish I could get that back as well. No answer from corporate JJ, but I'm honestly not surprised. I don't expect a company that's run by an avid trophy hunter of endangered animals to have any morals. At this point, the best I can do is hope you do not have the same bad luck I had and that you'll never have to deal with the manager. I've told everyone who is important to me at my company of 200+ that I will no longer be supporting this location, and they will do the same. The one person who disregarded my warning ordered it the next day and left two hours later vomiting profusely from food poisoning. This location is spiraling the drain, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm not really sure how to even sum up our most recent experience at a Jimmy John's in Urbana. First off, the music was so loud that I'm not sure what we would have done if they didn't offer outdoor seating. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy listening to music while I eat but this wasn't listening it was enduring. Where do I even begin? I ordered a slim turkey for our two small kids. I thought that they came with cheese and turkey but they said that is not true and would only put meat on the sandwich and when I asked to put some mayonnaise they said that that could not be done but they would give me a packet of mayonnaise to add myself-what?! We did not get any napkins with our sandwiches, when I went to the counter to ask for some I was flippantly told that they were at the end of the sandwich making counter. There were no napkins out, no lids, no straws... So bizarre! An employee was sitting at the booth closest to the ordering counter. After eating his meal he was smoking a vaporizer for a good 10 minutes or so -could be longer since we left and he was still there. There are more details I could add but I will stop. Overall the weirdest experience at a Jimmy John's we have ever had. Honestly, it was like the staff were high but not in a good way. :/"}
{"text":"I cannot praise this location enough! I have been a patron of JJ for many years. I have been to many locations in different states and throughout the Vegas/Henderson valley. This one in particular is hands down the BEST. In a day and age where customer service, kindness, and common courtesy is lacking this location reigns supreme. I have visited this JJ many different occasions from lunch rush during the week to late in the evening on a weekday. No matter the day or time the service and quality is always on point.   The staff including the manager and owner are all wonderful. Always with a smile and extremely friendly to my son and I. I will go out of my way to go to this location cause I know my sandwich will be perfect and I will be greeted with a smile. I am on the PTO for my son's school and I am so happy to have them cater the end of the year picnic for the volunteers and their families.   Thank you so much Shane and the Jimmy John's crew for always brightening my day and filling my belly with the perfect Vito every time!!!"}
{"text":"7/20/17.... Oh FYI ,1 star is too much.Nope, they still it right. This time, no napkins, sweet n low, straw, mustard or Mayo packets. I'm done. You will not see me again. I'll get rid of the app, I'm done. Insane... Insane.. Fast fast fast means, we do our job or directions you've given us.  I deserve my money back after this order. They are lucky I am having a diabetic reaction or I'd have them take the food back. This was the worst ever... Ever.. It's just stupid."}
{"text":"They are so fast fast fast they forget to give you all you ordered. I ordered packets of mayo and mustard to control the amount I want, no napkins. Now I've got a dry sandwich which just sucks. I've got to find another place to order food because I'm about done with Jimmy John's. They get it wrong on most orders, whether it work or home, they leave something out. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I got most the order and the girl who delivered it was kind. I should have checked.. That's what I get for thinking they might get it right."}
{"text":"I work at the Red Rock across the street and decided to order a sub today for lunch. I was in a bit of a time crunch because I had to go on break by 3. I didn't call until 2:35 and the man in the phone assured me that it would be here on time so I placed my order. I ordered a number 4 with extra hot peppers which only came out to 6$. I was very happy with that. Because I work in the hotel it was kind of complicated to explain how to get to where I was.   When we got off the phone I got my money ready and expected it to take at least 20 minutes for the delivery. To my amazement, my sandwich was here in no time. I literally got my sandwich within 10 minutes of placing the order, and there was no difficulties finding where I was. Once I sat down to eat it I was also blown away. It's was absolutely delicious!   I am so pleased with Jimmy Johns and will be placing many more lunch orders in the future !"}
{"text":"As a frequent visitor to jimmy johns, I was very disappointed with this one. So disappointed that I will not return to this location and will not recommend it to anyone.   Me and my boyfriend walked in and approached the cash register. The entire staff of 7-8 people working were chatting and not paying attention. When someone finally decided to take our order they seemed like it was a trouble to take our order by no means did the man pay attention to what we were saying. I ordered a number 12 with hot peppers and I ordered and number 13 with hot peppers on the side. When I picked up my sandwiches at the end of the line the girl at the end sloppily wrapped our sandwiches and threw them on the counter in front of me. I mention that I ordered hot peppers on the side. Her tone was very rude when she let me know that they were not allowed to give out hot peppers on the side because she did not have containers to put the peppers in. I told her that I would not care if she wrapped them in a sand which paper. With an even more ride tone she said no. I asked her why the man at the register would let me order them on the side if they did not do that and she proceeded to grab Brad, the man that took my order. He told me it was against company policy to give out condiments on the side. I grabbed my sloppily draped sandwiches and walked out. I was blown away with how rude everyone on the staff was. I will take my business to another Jimmy Johns even though I live down the street from this one.. Very disappointed with my favorite sandwich shop."}
{"text":"So fast so fresh and with the expansion of this location this jimmy johns is the best sand witch place around the area."}
{"text":"Order faithfully from this location. First couple times were really fast delivery. Last couple times it's taken over 20minutes for a sub and chips.  Sooory."}
{"text":"I would prefer to give zero stars. I visited this location for the first time yesterday. The only words spoken to me by the four emloyees was when the cashier gave me my total. I was not impressed with the sandwich at all. I had an urge for Firehouse and settled for rude service and nasty food. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Lighting fast sandwich making skills! I could hardly believe. Fresh and delicious food. Yumm"}
{"text":"This place is decent but hours arent posted. Closed right now at 3pm on Sunday. Must hate weekends and or lunch. WHAT ARE YOUR HOURS?!"}
{"text":"THE UNWHICH!!!  Watching my calories and working out.  The last thing I want is to cheat my diet.  Then I found the Unwhich.  The heavy calorie filled bread is replaced by a lettuce wrap.  Not only do I get less calories,  but I still get ALL THE FLAVOR!!!  I Love it, even if I wasn't counting calories.  The Hunter Unwhich with cherry peppers,  sprouts, onions, and vinegar and oil.  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"So Jimmy Johns touts themselves on their \"Freaky Fast\" delivery but that is only IF they choose to deliver to where you live.  We ordered from our location which is basically 4 blocks west of downtown Stoughton and 2.1 miles from the Jimmy Johns store.  We were told that they won't deliver to us again because we were out of their delivery area but they DO deliver to Stoughton Hospital which is 2.4 miles from their store.  Who chooses their delivery area and why don't they just deliver to the whole city of Stoughton?  No worries though, there are plenty of places that are more than willing to deliver to our house."}
{"text":"I decided to give Jimmy another chance using the gift card I got for my previous experience. Only a 20 minute delivery time and a MUCH more courteous, personable staff member who had NO issues finding the unit. AND...No smashed cookie! Redeemed!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, especially the Vito and Beach.  Music is bit loud.  Yeah it is a chain and I'm usually not down w that.  But the Vito is so damned good that I'll make an exception."}
{"text":"I always get food here at prime lunch time. Even if there is a line out the front door, I am out of there in 5 minutes. Fast service, friendly staff, and enjoyable food."}
{"text":"Love Jimmy John's!   They have many sandwiches to choose from. Their bread is amazing they make it fresh. Every day and if the bread is 4 hours old they throw it away and make fresh bread. They also sale Day old bread for like 49 cents a loaf. They are well known as being freaky fast.   So you can pick any sandwich you can add things to the sandwich like extra meat, veggies, or sauces. Also you can choose if you want your sandwich in a lettuce wrap, wheat bread or french bread. If you choose french bread you can have it either 8 inch (original) or 16 inch (giant) bread.   They also have slims which is no ingredients on the sandwich just meat & bread & cheese if it comes with it or if you add it.   I love their chips they are kettle chips the original & barbecue chips are amazing!   They also have cookies oatmeal & chocolate chip.   My favorite is the #7 smoked ham club, it's double ham with cheese, tomatoes & lettuce. I like to add some cucumbers & oregano.   The number #9 Italian night club  & #12 beach club is the most popular.   They do deliver but only a 5 mile radius.  Also it's a great place to work for teens.  Also I love their $1 sub day. Usually it's every year around summer time."}
{"text":"Recently drove thru for lunch on the way back to work. The sandwich was pretty much as ordered, but evidently it stymied the girl taking the orders on what it means for a drink to come with \"easy ice.\" Pulled up, was handed a drink FULL OF ICE! Handed it back, asked her to please pour out half the ice. She just glared at me. No, \"sorry about that, etc.\" And then just handed it to me with the same flat affect and 1000 mile stare. Very poor customer service. Especially when there are so many other places to choose from in downtown Mesa. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I work for a company close to this location, and on days when I can't leave for lunch I have ordered from them. After today, never again. I placed my order at 10:49am (early enough to beat the lunch crowd) and then I waited. And waited, and waited. This is the \"Lightening Fast\" JIMMY JOHNS isn't it? Both times when I called to inquire as to where my food was (I work less than a mile from their store) I received plenty of excuses, platitudes, and evidently outright lies. Clearly the folks working there, including the manager who I spoke to the second time I called, could care less. Took over an hour to get my food. Delivery guy was full of excuses too. Guess they won't be missing my business and that of my colleagues, who number about 100. What a pathetic excuse for a business."}
{"text":"The bread was stale, and for some reason, they always get my order wrong. Probably the worst store I've been to."}
{"text":"This Jimmy John's location has always been \"freaky fast\". They have a drive thru window, and very nice indoor/outdoor seating.   Nothing to do with this location but Jimmy John's subs have always been sub par in my option. You can likely find a better sub for a similar price in the area.  Tip: Jimmy John's sells their bread from the previous day for $0.50!"}
{"text":"Fresh, fast subs. A little more expensive than Subway and the same ingredients basically."}
{"text":"We love Jimmy John's but this location is disappointing. We live less than 3 miles away and they do not deliver, though there were two Jimmy John's delivery cars in the parking lot. That being said, their sandwiches tasted fresh and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns! If I could marry him I would! I went to this one for the customer appreciation deal of $1 subs and they were quick! I only waited in line for like 5 minutes. The atmosphere is great, you go in and they have the music going, they say hello and look like they are enjoying where they are. Good place!"}
{"text":"We visit here frequently. Always prompt courteous service. The Resturant is super clean  and the staff extremely efficient"}
{"text":"These guys are freaky fast on delivery which I can't get enough of.  Love the #12 on wheat.  It can get me thru lunch and afternoon hunger attack."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday and got a sub, it was great.  Bread is the best, real chewy, almost sourdough like, without being stale.   People making my sandwich were really nice and friendly, cute too!    I got a number 8....don't remember the name of it.  The only downside is I didn't eat it right away and it got a little soggy because there's a lot of mayonnaise on it.  Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of mayonnaise, so I didn't have a problem with it.  Just didn't know it would get soggy if it sat.  The solution to this problem, eat that sub as soon as you get it..and I will.  I'll be back, Jimmy Johns!"}
{"text":"Just like any other JJ's, this location features super fast service! Sandwiches are done immediately after you pay and typically before I'm even able to fill my drink. The sandwiches are delicious as well and this has been one of my favorite sub franchises for years. I didn't know this location was here until yesterday and I'm happy I found it because the old one I used to go to on Charleston/Rancho doesn't seem to be there anymore. This is the next closest one. My favs are the Turkey Tom and the Vito (if you like Italian subs)"}
{"text":"A sandwich shop that delivers?! I just had my mind blown.   Lately I've been on a sandwich kick and luckily while at work my co workers wanted jimmy johns. Had never heard of the place but once they showed me the menu I was hooked, the lulu sounded delicious and when I looked on yelp at the pictures I was sold. What's on the lulu?? Sliced turkey breast, crispy bacon (best I ever had!) lettuce tomato, mayo.   Big amount of meat, and the same seasoning as capriottis almost. Why not five stars? They're sandwiches were tiny. Or maybe I'm a fatty and they just seems small? I don't know, I think they were a bit bigger than a subway six inch.   The part that really surprised me was there service. Delivered to my work in less than six minutes?! Unbelievable. If I didn't know better I would shave thought this guy made it in his car. How do they make them so fast? I need to know their tricks.  It's free for extra mayo, onion, tomatoes, lettuce, sliced cucumber, and Dijon mustard.   They have kettle cooked chips which are my favorite. This sandwich place is going to be my new go to pace for when I'm at work or at home feeling lazy. We all know my sandwiches at home are not as good.   Jimmy johns expect a date next week. You. Me. Creative kids. 2pm. Don't forget the sandwich."}
{"text":"Poor service.  They shorted our takeout order on May 17th.  We called when we got home and realized this.  The person who answered the phone suggested they could deliver to us.  Then the manager told him we lived outside their delivery area.  Our home is 2.4 miles from their shop.  We won't be going there again."}
{"text":"This place is just ok.  I keep giving this chain a try about once a year but nothing great. Jersey Mikes has a better product."}
{"text":"This was by far the WORST experience that I have had at a Jimmy Johns. The staff appeared to not enjoy being there, I asked for hot peppers and my sandwich cut in half and got home to realize that neither happened and my sandwich barely had any dressing. It was also freaky slow. Disappointing because I typically love grabbing a Jimmy!"}
{"text":"Their delivery guys are GREAT...polite, friendly, young and on time. They deliver riding their bikes. Happy doing their best representing JJ.  My Italian Stallion, chips and Coke get's the job done, in a pinch. Satisfied customer..."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. You're not going to eat one and say \"holy carp this is amazing!\" But you will get an edivle sandwit sandwich fast. I have to give it to them they are fast just as they advertise. I imagine if i was starving these would taste that much better.   Their app is pretty dope. You can push a few buttons and they bring you your sandwich fast.   I usually go with the gargantuan sandwich. It seems to be their flagship sandwich."}
{"text":"The only jimmy johns I have ever been to that refused to let me order a \"side\" of peppers. Explaining to a high school teen how to wrap up the peppers with the sandwich, without putting it on the sandwich, was impossible. I love jimmy johns but I may go to other locations. The food was great, but customer service needs to go beyond just saying a \"hello\" at the door."}
{"text":"Got the Veggie Sub from here and it was pretty good. The service was fast and friendly and all the ingredients tasted very fresh. The sandwich was neither dry nor soggy and seemed to hold everything okay. I wish that they had more choices of bread BUT otherwise I enjoyed my food."}
{"text":"Seriously a great place for a quick bite at a low price. I'm normally not a big fan of sandwich chains, but Jimmy John's just does it right for me :) My favorite sandwich is the Italian night club."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a Jimmy John's near campus because I thought it was an East Coast thing. That being said I went in today around 12:45. The place was packed and I thought I'd have to wait a few minutes for my sandwich but alas I was wrong. As soon as I received my receipt, my sandwich was being handed to me! Great service during a busy lunch rush which means I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"It wasn't fast and I wanted to freak in a bad way ...because of the service and because of the sandwich. I typically love Jimmy Johns and one would assume they should all taste the same, but the avocado on my beach club (my usual and favorite sandwich) tasted sour and like a really pungent onion. I waited at least 15 minutes  for my sandwich and it was hardly crowded.   Unfortunately, I got it to go and didn't realize the sandwich was so bad until I was far from the establishment. There were many people working but no one seemed to be making sandwiches quickly as I am used to at other locations (the Oakland location btw is amazing). When a manager left he joked that if anything went wrong that they (employees) should just say it's their first day. They didn't need to say it, it felt like it."}
{"text":"Called for delivery 12:52p, now 1:32 and still no order.. Subs so fast you'll freak??! No, subs so slow I'm now freaking out because I'm starving"}
{"text":"I always use this location as it is closest to the house. I usually go in and order the #4. Food is great, but my main complaint is the last time we ordered delivery, it took an hour. When I lived in Reno and another area of Vegas, delivery was always so fast. If I was on my way home from work, I would call them 5 minutes before getting home because it was usually there before me."}
{"text":"So I got the Big John (#2) and it left me with much to desire.  I normally love Jimmy Johns, usually one of my go to sandwhich places but boy do they skimp on the meat now a days. My sandwhich had one sliver if roast beef folded over, definitely not getting my money's worth out of this sandwhich.  So very disappointing Jimmy Johns!!!!"}
{"text":"I am old enough to know the benefits of a sure thing. In my earlier years I was okay with taking a chance more often but now, in my early thirties, I find that having a known quantity in life is very valuable. Jimmy John's is that known quantity. If I am ever on the fence, not sure what I want, low on time, I can go to this place and KNOW that I am going to get a good sandwich, at a good price, and made very quickly. I really like knowing these things in life.  Thankfully JJ's came through and took over this ex-Quiznos location. I was never a fan of Quiznos and apparently the rest of the area seemed to agree because they obviously didn't make it. The location is pretty easy to get to residing on the Northwest corner of a fairly busy intersection. It if off downtown a bit but that works out for me considering where I work. Lots of windows in the place makes for wonderful natural lighting in a standard Jimmy John's decor. Inviting I would say.  The sandwiches are good. I have never had a bad sandwich here, just a bad combination, and that is my fault. I like to try different combinations and every once in a while I have to find out on my own I don't like certain mixtures. If I ever come in for the previously mentioned \"sure thing\", I am going with the Italian Night Club. Salami, capicola, ham, provolone, and all the fixins with lettuce, tomato, onion, ma... You get the gist of it. Fresh ingredients with really good bread. Once you find your combo, I am certain you will be happy with the integrity of the individual ingredients.  Now, this place isn't akin to the artisan offerings in the area. I get that. I know of several different places that serve very delicious food just around the corner. But they aren't as fast or of the same value. I am talking about the consistency here. We once tried the BBQ place across the parking lot (20 paces) from this JJ's and it wasn't that good. I feel for a place that can't cut it in such a good location but that is what business is all about I think. Consequently, they are no longer in that shop. There is a place called So We Meat Again down the road as well. It's a great sandwich but the speed and price aren't the same. I still go there, but not as often. I simply value things differently in different situations I suppose."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch before seeing a movie. After looking at the menu for a bit, I decided to get the Gargantuan since I was very hungry. Once I got my sandwich I was very happy to see that it was fully loaded. When it comes to sub sandwiches, I devour them, but I had to take a break about 3/4 the way through. I eventually finished it with time to spare to see my movie and was very happy with it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love the bootlegger. Good Sandwich every time."}
{"text":"Damn they need to hire people with some better attitude and more enthusiasm. The young dude working today look like he is still in that 4/20 mode by that I mean high as a mothaaafudddging kyte. No greet, no here's your food, no words came out of this kids mouth at all. Acting like I owe them something.  Horrible service. Not to be picky but I ordered a whole pickle and got it cut in forths... just sayin"}
{"text":"For some reason they won't deliver less than a mile up the street on Penn. Apparently it's out of area or they don't want to associate with that neighborhood."}
{"text":"Usually I have good times going to Jimmy John's. Not this time. First time to this location and I'm pretty disappointed. I asked for two JJBLT's with avocado, cucumbers, onions on both of them and pickles and salami on one and a LOT of mustard packets. I got two JJBLT's with avocado on both....and everything else on only one of them. My onions were on the receipt but not on the sandwich and despite asking three times for mustard packets, I still didn't get any. I did, however, get an enormous handful of mayonnaise packets that I didn't need. The young man taking my order was not a good listener, didn't even look at me once, and was turned away from me the whole time. After he finished taking my order (with excessive difficulty), he just walked away! Saying nothing! Rude! I wouldn't call myself a critical person of food workers because I was one for a year and a half recently and it was hellish so I get it but even my rude self was nice to customers even when they weren't nice to me. I'm quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Service is fine but I had to take off 2 stars because this place is FREEZING!!! Every time I come here on my lunch, I have to sneak over to Panera Bread's outside dining tables because it's just too cold inside. Also, the music is super-loud, it's like being at a dance club."}
{"text":"I love all Jimmy Johns but this one takes the cake. First off it has a drive-thru. I was thrilled when I saw that pulling in,  it was negative temperatures outside. As all JJs - great fresh sandwiches. I usually just get the Pepe. Oh and I asked for a cup of water and expected one of those dinky water cups, but no, I got a giant cup of water for free."}
{"text":"The day that I went to eat here it was almost 2 in the afternoon and the place was dirty. There were 2 of us here and 7 employees and just about every table was dirty. I decided to ask for some napkins and cleaned my own table.  Once I got my sandwich I thought it was ok. I don't think I'll be back.  I remember Jimmy Johns from Illinois State University but this is definitely not the Jimmy Johns of ISU!"}
{"text":"In my travels through Arizona, I have passed by several Jimmy John's locations and was curious about the food. So today I gave it a try. The negative reviews concerned me about this location.  When I ordered my sandwich (Vito) I asked for the vinaigrette on the side. \"We can't do that.\" And yes, he was serious. Why can Subway, Quizno's, Jersey Mike's, and Togo's do it but you can't? Ok, you lose one star there.  The sandwich, however, was good and given the size, a good value. Lots of meat and vegetables. Chips are fairly plain in flavor however and packaged under the Jimmy John's name. Would have preferred a national brand. So, overall 3 stars and willing to try it again."}
{"text":"Great food, great employees, and freaky fast, just like advertised. I go here nearly every day and they have not disappointed yet. Only complaint is that the water tastes like it is straight from the bathroom so buy a bottled one if you plan on drinking water. Vote for Jimmy!"}
{"text":"This was one of the first JJ's in Phoenix and I've gone at least a dozen times.  The staff is always welcoming ( You feel like Norm from Cheers when you walk in the door) The food is done freakishly fast and I love their bread!  Order the #9 the Italian Nightclub with extra hot peppers, it's my fav and one of their most popular sandwiches (I sat next to the area where they pump the sandwiches out and it seems like #9 is at least every other sandwich).  I wish they would do two things differently, one, cut the sandwich-I always forget to request it) and two, they don't offer any sweetener for the ice tea.  But now I'm nitpicking :)  It's a sandwich, not a steak dinner, but a great one at that.  Very satisying meal!  Love the chips, too!"}
{"text":"Delivers food no napkins I'm at a hair shop and really didn't think I had to ask for some when I ordered a sloppy sandwich"}
{"text":"I love their sandwiches. Particularly the Vito, Turkey Tom, and Totally Tuna. You can't go wrong with ordering a sandwhich when you're in a rush and just gotta get in an out, because they truly are freaky fast. However, I think their speed is really affecting their ability to do things correctly. It's not a huge deal, but on 3 separate occasions I have ordered my sandwiches to be cut in half and they have failed to do so. And one time they failed to cut my pickle in quarters. Like I  said, it's not a huge deal, but why offer the option if you cannot follow through?"}
{"text":"Got to the location at 10:03 not realizing that they were closed.  I walked up to the door to try to get a better view of their hours because I wasn't sure if they were still open or not.  I couldn't find the hours posted anywhere, but a delivery driver pulled up and I questioned if the store was still open.  He mentioned that he would ask his boss, so he walked inside and came back out and told me that they can still make an order for me.  Yahoo!!!  I made sure to order quickly and have my payment ready so that I wasn't too much of an inconvenience.  But I was very happy that they went out of their way to stay open for me.  Amazing customer service!  And the of course the food is always great :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a Beach Club for delivery @ 3:35 and my sandwich arrived @ 3:42. Impressive!"}
{"text":"Jimmy is pretty much my go to venue for a sammich when I can't travel or I need it snappy. This store is the brightest, cleanest jimmy I have ever stepped foot in!! The staff were super cool too and got me into a good conversation for a couple minutes. I have been to a couple previously run by some lackluster folks but this PLACE IS PUT TOGETHER RIGHT!"}
{"text":"My daughter was attending a dance convention nearby so I placed an online order scheduled for delivery at her lunch break. An HOUR after that delivery time had passed and after her lunch break had ended they still had not arrrived with her lunch. When I called to check on the order they were unapologetic and refused to give me a time that the order might be delivered. The answer I got was an unapologetic, \"we had too many orders\". Well, shouldn't you not be able to take in more orders than you can handle in a delivery timeframe??? Since they refused to tell me when they might deliver it I was left not knowing if I should wait for it or try to run somewhere else hoping to order and get it back to her in time. I opted to wait and hope which was the wrong decision... the food never came. Irate and not only will I never order from THIS Jimmie John's but I will never order from ANY Jimmie John's. Do not order if you need your meal in a specific timeframe!"}
{"text":"No where near as good as firehouse subs. Environment and food.   Walked in and music sounded like we were in a club it was so loud. Cashier kept asking what seemed to be the supervisor to turn it down but he wouldn't listen to her. Finally, after not being able to hear each other speak, my husband asked him to turn it down and received eye roll and a ton of attitude. He did turn it down a notch though, but barely.  Food: I ordered the #2, which was, meh.. at firehouse it has so much flavor I stuff myself. Here I ate till I wasn't hungry anymore and threw the rest away. Same with my husband on the #17..  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Another speedy Jimmy Johns, another tasty sandwich.  I don't know how they do it but their sandwiches are super quick, super speedy and not hard on your wallet either.  This location is located alongside a mattress store off busy Park Rd in Pineville.  I definitely made sure I was making a right into the place because not sure that a left turn would happen - they'd probably be able to make all the subs before I'd make that left turn.  Anyways, this Jimmy Johns was spotless and they were still cleaning - definitely a great place to stop for a quick lunch or dinner if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Great, tasty sandwiches really make JJ locations the only consistent sandwich place in the valley.  Why five stars?  Well the other places are just either good or bad depending on many things.  There is something great to be said about consistency!  Leave the canolli and take the Vito!"}
{"text":"Jimmy John is completely bull****.....order a sandwich for delivery stuck at work couldn't leave...called at 12:08 pm and it's now 12:37 and I'm still waiting freaky fast my ass.......never again!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love Jimmy Johns delivery. Just wish they would ask what type of bread you want for each sandwich. It would save a lot of confusion in ordering for our office lunches!"}
{"text":"For the price you really cannot beat the \"big John\" which is a roast beef sandwich on white  with chips and a drink. Don't forget to add the hot peppers and the oil & vinegar combo  or else you're just getting lettuce, Mayo and tomato as standard dress. The only complaint is the fact that Cheese is something you must request and have added after the fact, which i learned on my first go around when my order came sans cheese.  Other than that everything else is A-OK and do yourself a favor and get some Sea salt and vinegar chips. Your taste buds will love you for it."}
{"text":"Just ordered a 56$ delivery and they put ice in my soda even tho I requested no ice & it says no ice on my receipt, and on one sandwich I asked for ez sauce but it was way too much, then on the other sandwich it was a ton of mayo, plus the soda leaked all over everything, and we asked for fun pictures on each sandwich and they just write the word, plus it was requested to sing happy birthday to the birthday boy and the guy just said it's somebody's birthday."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's. No complaints here. Always friendly and fast. Fresh bread and veggies."}
{"text":"I ordered Jimmy Johns online to be delivered. They were super fast! (delivered my sandwiches in less than 15 minutes! The sandwiches were really good, and made just how i ordered.   Super impressed."}
{"text":"Just got my italian sandwich. Service was fast French bread is good and soft Although, I generally would like my sandwich to be toasted, I would rate the sandwich a 4 star rating.  It tastes very good and i would come here again."}
{"text":"Every time I've gone here, the customer service has been abhorrent.  The last time I went, the girl was very curt, didn't smile, and seemed like she was hurrying through the transaction so she could get back to playing with her phone (Right out in the open, by the way).  They charge $0.50 more per sandwich than other JJ's.  It's a shame because it's the closest one to my house, and the sandwiches are ok, but the customer service is dismal."}
{"text":"This is our go to sandwich shop because of the excellent customer service. They are always super friendly and attentive.  When it comes to the sandwiches, we have many favorites. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Always surprised by how nice these guys are! Fast and friendly unlike most of your  ex-girlfriends/boyfriends!"}
{"text":"Hardly any meat on the sub, two whole slices of roast beef.  Employees not very friendly and the guy who took my order was kind of a smart a@@."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sandwich shops to go to. Very clean, everyone greets you with a hello and a smile and need a say FAST? ;) When I'm trying to be good I always get a #4 turkey Tom with no mayo. But who are we kidding? Most days I get a #9 Italian sub with hot peppers. Don't waste your time getting it without, the hot peppers make the sandwich!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Ordered 2 sandwiches and they delivered 1. The \"area manager\" is completely incompetent."}
{"text":"We (unfortunately) don't have Jimmy John's in California. After spotting one while walking around ASU, I knew I had to stop in. I know it sounds crazy that I'd get excited over a basic sandwich...but what really drew me in was their \"Unwich\" that I've been seeing all over social media.  I ended up ordering the \"Vito\" which comes with salami, provolone, capicola, oninion, lettuce, tomato, and italian vinaigrette. I asked if they could switch out the vinaigrette for mayo and mustard as I feared the lettuce wrap would be soaking from the wetness of the vinaigrette. Additionally, I asked for hot peppers thinking that they'd be peppercinis...NOPE. These were red and hotter, and I ended up having to pull them out since I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food.  The sandwich came out super quickly. Ended up diving in and enjoying every bite! They even had little pictorials explaining how to properly eat/tear off the paper wrapping for the unwich which, as a newbie, I found helpful. All in all, I really enjoyed my healthy little wrap. Good price for good food. If only they would expand to California!"}
{"text":"Super average sub, but cheap and tastes good enough. Really quick service, and delivery is a huge plus. The only unfortunate thing is that the delivery range is pretty small, but if you're nearby, you'll have your sub in less than ten minutes. I recommend the #1, it's what I always get!"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed. I love Jimmy Johns but this location made me the skimpiest sandwich. I paid over $7.00 for a turkey sandwich that had two slices of turkey on it....literately"}
{"text":"This is the closest location to me. It's 3.2 miles away and they won't deliver to me. Terrible."}
{"text":"I need to post this to hopefully get the situation explained more in depth and rectified.  Attn: BRANDON (manager)  I did an online order today for my office. I did the payment online with credit card like I normally do, get my confirmation e-mail and then I am good to go, so I thought. I get a call from one of the workers there and he says there is a balance still from the order I placed. This didn't make sense to me because I have never had this problem nor do I understand how it is possible? He tells me there is a $1.01 balance remaining; I tell him to come here and I will take care of it. Once he arrives, he tells me that the \"system isn't charging the correct amounts\". I don't know what that means or how it happened but I looked on our office's business account and the same amount charged there matched what my CONFIRMATION e-mail reflected. Once the gentlemen arrived he explained the best way he could have, of why I had to pay that amount, but I am still wondering why it wasn't waived per Brandon and the \"system's\" errors. I took care of the balance owed and gave him gratuity like I normally do here. I order from this location multiple times a month for my employees here.. This situation definitely needs attention.  - Jesse"}
{"text":"I got my order delivered, and during the call I specifically asked for mustard packets to come along with my order, I did not receive any mustard packets , nor a straw for my drink AND my drink was only 3/4th full !! Worst encounter ever with any jimmy johns !"}
{"text":"So fast,so good,and so expensive when you eat there religiously like i do...lol."}
{"text":"Since no one wears name tags I cannot offer the name of this employee, but he appears to be in his 40s with a long ponytail down his back that has rubber bands in it. He has no business being in customer service. He's strange and impolite and even his coworkers don't seem to like him. He couldn't even be bothered to help customers choose the sub they want because he didn't make any suggestions on bread or food. Sandwich was okay. No offense to older people in customer service, but if you're 40 at Jimmy John's then you should be able to offer some level of customer service."}
{"text":"They are fast, and always taste great, I love the drive thru , and so happy they made it out this way.  They have many different subs but I simply prefer the pepe.  Can't beat it, tastes way better than subway"}
{"text":"Great Jimmy Johns location. Stand only building makes it easy to park. The service was fantastic. I ordered a platter of sandwiches online and they had everything ready to go when I arrived.  And they helped me carry everything to the car.   Great place for lunch and catering. Wish I would've gotten the guys name that helped me. He was great! Nice work!!"}
{"text":"5 consecutive orders made for delivery over the last 2 months and not a SINGLE one of them has shown up correct. From missing sandwiches, wrong chips, no drink, to the completely wrong sandwich toppings... This Jimmy Johns delivery is about as organized as a junkyard.   And for the \"so fast you'll freak\" crowd, the last two orders took 40 minutes to be delivered to less that 2 miles away."}
{"text":"Love JJ\"s BUT NOT THIS LOCATION. Don't eat here! We got really sick/ food poisoning the last time we ordered (about a month ago). Mayo on a sandwich, in a backpack delivered an hr and a half later screams diarrhea!!   This place used to be good and fast in 2012 but not anymore. If I could give half a star I would. \"Freaky fast delivery...\" My ass!  A typical order takes over an hour to be delivered three blocks. When it arrives its clearly old and soggy depending on the ingredients you have on your sandwich. Mayo on a sandwich in a backpack delivered an hr and a half later, on a hot day screams diarrhea!! Bike drivers have no apologies and offer the explanation that they are \"short staffed\" and \"when it's raining we take longer, so keep that in mind when ordering\".   There's a rude crackhead worker answering the phone, with a unprofessional \"what's u want\" attitude. Even when u go into the store its dingy and dark, unlike other locations. No seating, take out or delivery only. Take my advice please eat anywhere else, ur stomach will thank you!"}
{"text":"I like jimmy johns, just not this location! After going to many different locations and only ever ordering the beach club (no tomato) I have never had a single complaint about the sandwich. I'm not one to slyly ask for extra guacamole and this visit was no different.  After ordering and biting into my sandwich I see 2 tiny spots of guacamole between my cheese slices. WAY less than I'm used to. Normally its squeezing out of my sandwich and it's a delicious mess. So I went back to ask for a bit more and the rude sandwich maker behind the counter took my sandwich and flat out said, No, we only use so and so amount on every sandwich. I told him I'd never had such a small amount before but he refused to give me even a dab. So I said ok and walked back to my seat. As I am walking back I hear him continuing to inaudibly speak to me and end with.... \"nothing comes free in this world\". I was deeply offended by this very rude comment in front of the whole jimmy johns making me look as if I was trying to pull one over on him or something. I will not come to this location again because of that ONE person who was acting as the sandwich nazi. No guacamole for you! Well, no business for you! Now you may have to work a bit harder at your customer service skills, as you know, nothing comes free in this world."}
{"text":"Why is it so LOUD?!? I mean, really, bloody, LOUD. They can't hear my order, they can't hear each other and when I've eaten in the store I find myself scarfing my sandwich to the beat of some crazed EDM/Techno nightmare just to get out of there.   Sandwiches are pretty good."}
{"text":"I heard a LOT about this place before I tried it, so I was expecting it to be amazing. The sandwiches are good, but nothing special, so not sure what the hype is about. That being said, my favorite thing is that I have stopped in a couple of nights on my way home from school right when they are about to close, and the staff has been very friendly and never rushes me or seems annoyed that I came in so late like a lot of other places. So that gains them an extra star from me!"}
{"text":"If you need something quick and semi-affordable I would recommend taking advantage of the delivery service. I like the convenience that it gives me. There has been a few times after getting my food a little later I felt sick; however, I noticed it's only when I order my sandwich with lettuce. I've heard from some friends they've experienced the same thing and had to stop ordering their meals with the lettuce. I have gone into the store and had lunch as well. It was neat and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Jimmy John's area, a little small for space with limited seating, and located right next to Winco. Very clean, attentive staff that greeted me once I entered, and pretty easy to order.  I didn't have any problems with service since I was the only customer, and the staff were fast and friendly. No complaints!   I always order the #4 Turkey sandwich and get the free optional sprouts every time. There are set menu options, but there is also a free condiments list that you can order from to add to any sandwich."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. The girl working the register literally just stood and stared at me. No hello, no nothing. Got my chips and ordered and she mumbled something and rang up the total. Never said another word. Thank goodness, the quality is good and they're always fast."}
{"text":"I'm a generally big fan of Jimmy John's, but relative to other locations, the sandwiches seem to pump out just a smidgen slower here. Quality control seems to be an occasionally issue here too, from meat and cheese sparse in some parts of the sandwich, and bursting out in others, and the balance of condiments sometimes just tasting off.  Overall, just *okay* for Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"great snadwhiches and grrat prices and tbey stayy oprn late . highly recommend after tbe bar"}
{"text":"I am completely obsessed with this place. Super fast good quality subs with plenty of staff and good service. The sandwiches are amazing and a good price. I love them and go there almost every week!"}
{"text":"Since Jimmy John's has opened two stores here in the north Scottsdale valley, this is my review from their Scottsdale Road/ Hayden Greenway location.  \"One of the things I miss from the Midwest is the choices available in gourmet sandwich shops. I've always thought there must be something in the water, but after reading the business section for many years you realize that the old adage about selling something in Peoria, IL is correct. Can you say test market?   The greater Chicagoland area had Jimmy John's, Jersey Mikes, Pot Bellies, Quizno's, et cetera over ten years ago. But, if you wait long enough sometimes things come to you. Jimmy's John's for the most part is a college sub shop (started many years ago in Elgin).  Which makes sense, because if you wanted one of their subs up until now you needed to drive down to Tempe and ASU.  But, that doesn't mean they're making poor quality subs -- they're actually making GREAT subs!  Their sandwiches are fresh, they use quality meats and seem to have learned the art of self-humor in their marketing: \"Subs so fast, you'll freak!\"  They actually merchandise this stuff!  Also, when you go, make sure you read their signage on the walls.   It's really very funny.  Great, great sandwiches -- Enjoy!  Now, all I need to do is wait a little longer for Pot Belly and Lou Malnati's to come to the Valley!  Hum, anyone want to take the over/under bet of 5 years? \""}
{"text":"Great healthy alternative, hate when people yell ripoff because when restaurants price food it includes quality & convenience. My lettuce wrap with turkey, tomato & crisp lettuce was $5.49!! How cheap can you be people, if you want cheap grab something off the value menu at your yellow arches, lol!! My hubby got the Italian sub #9 @ $6.69, sounds reasonably priced to me & good too!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Very fast standard Jimmy Johns!  Because we're in Champaign (where they train lots of people) it seems you get very good service at every JJ's you go to!  Wish they were open a bit later, but that's just personal preference!"}
{"text":"This place is better than the one at Desert Ridge- but it seems to have the same problem.  Good food- bad management.  There were about 6 employees in here when I came in and only 2 of them were actually doing something."}
{"text":"The food is alright- the service is not.  My family went there for a quick dinner on February 14th.  With my 9 month old son in tow, we asked for extra cheese and avocado on the side so that he could enjoy the meal too.  Even though the menu states that they offer each, they told us that they could not accommodate our request but failed to give a reasonable explanation.  I decided that I would just get a sandwich that I could pick parts out of to feed my son- but the experience was not off to a good start.  Secondly, the place was empty.  We were the only patrons in the place while all of the adjacent restaurants were packed.  That's a red flag if ever I saw one.  The underage staff took advantage of this- playing the music too loud, throwing trash around behind the counter in order to make baskets into the garbage, and just generally not working.  The final nail in the coffin came when one of the employees took her break.  While in full view of us- and any other patrons had there been any- she flipped the bird to another employee.  She saw that I saw her and did nothing.  Didn't look ashamed that she was acting like a child or that she could potentially get in trouble.  I didn't see anyone that looked to be over the age of 20 working there.  No managers?  No wonder this place is being run so poorly.    I will be surprised if this place lasts here for a year.  The staff is untrained, juvenile, and too lazy to accommodate patrons.  We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Again, super crappy delivery service, with no care or sense of urgency when I call the store.  Umm....he should be there in about 5 minutes... was there response.  And they just don't care, they told me they've been extremely short staffed, yet, when I go inside to order they have a small army there making sandwiches, how can one place be so good inside yet have the worst delivery service?  I'm officially done with this place."}
{"text":"This is an easy review:  They slam it every time.  My order is always correct, and done quickly.  They even include napkins without asking.  Food is a good value and I like their taste.  Freaky fast!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've had! Our cashier LILY was incredibly sweet and funny! their #12 was really good and their pickles are amazing!!! will be coming back for lily."}
{"text":"I always get the beach club and have great service plus it's always done in about 2 or 3 mins. I come here atleast once a week or more and haven't had one bad experience.   I also love to buy yesterday's bread!"}
{"text":"Even though  only live 1.3 miles they dont deliver to my house. After i waited 3 min on hold , ordered then they decide to tell me this..."}
{"text":"The cleanest store and friendliest staff ever! Wonderful customer service. Good Food! Great location.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Very dissatisfied.  I spoke with the manager and she said that they weigh out the meat. There is supposed to be  3 grams on the sandwich. I guess that Is what I got.  NEVER AGAIN!#!#"}
{"text":"The produce that comes on jimmy johns sandwiches is always soggy and not fresh. Not worth the $$ at all. The only good thing about this place is their bread"}
{"text":"Every time I've come here it's during my 30 minute lunch break.  They are so fast, it's almost why I default to them if I don't bring my lunch.  Their vegetarian sandwich is really good as well as their sandwich with roast beef.  I don't count calories but I do try to stay on top of how much sodium I consume; when I looked up the nutritional facts for their sandwiches, they were ridiculous.  Most of the sandwiches averaged 1200 calories.  It doesn't bother me, but I'm just sayin' for those people that are concerned.  It's also super cheap!  My favorite sandwich shop. :)"}
{"text":"Okay, so I have been ordering from this location for the past year or so and I always get it delivered to my work. The delivery service is so fast every time, my order is never wrong and their delivery drivers are always very nice.  The food is always super good and they aren't shy  with loading the sandwiches! Love this location!!"}
{"text":"Filthy ! Dead when we walked in all employees weren't bothered about cleaning floor stocking straws or anything ! Made us wait 15min for straws"}
{"text":"I've never been a jimmy johns that slow.  It took then fifteen minutes just to make one sandwich inside the restaurant. I agree with others reviewers that this is the slowest jimmy johns ever."}
{"text":"The driver's are excellent, the sandwhiches are ok, but the customer service when you have a problem is terrible.   I've spoken to the manager Kelsey on two seperate occasions. The first time I called was because they forgot to include my chips with my order. Kelsey immediately says \"no, I saw him put them in the bag.\" I respond with \"well, they're not here.\" and we go back and forth until the driver comes back to my door with the chips and apologizes about the mistake.  Then today their POS system goes down. Kelsey calls to say that they're only taking cash orders. I don't carry cash and said she could just cancel my order and I'll try again when it's up. She immediately hung up on me. I understand it's frustrating when your system goes down, but no apology for the inconvenience, no acknowledgment of my business, and not even a goodbye?   I'm done giving this place my money."}
{"text":"Listen to the reviews that say \"don't go here.\" I ordered a sub (#5) with NO onions.  Got home and unwrapped the sub. Yes, onions. Tons of onions. It was basically an onion sandwich. I was the ONLY person there. How do you screw that up? Additionally, the guy behind the counter obviously did not want to be there. My suggestion, check your sandwich before leaving. One positive - the bread was very soft. It tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Recently I ordered subs for my managers at work and myself. Being a vegetarian I make sure to request no mayo and always order their veggie sub. However, when I got my order the sub I got had mayo as well as a pile of meat. I called the store and spoke with general manager PETE NEWTON who was very apologetic about the mishap. Not only did he replace the sub with the correct one, but he also took care of my managers and I for lunch the following day. The outstanding customer service I received, the quick delivery, as well as, the incredibly delicious sandwiches will keep me ordering from their store in the future. I now keep their menus on hand all over the office and when I'm ordering several of the office staff typically order something also. Thank you PETE NEWTON for your generosity. It was much appreciated and you will always have a customer in me."}
{"text":"In case anyone looks at this, this location is not participating in the $1 Customer Appreciation subs promotion today (4/21). Don't waste your time, and from the looks of other reviews for this location you're better off not going anyway."}
{"text":"Lazy and rude employees, asked for a #9 with hot peppers cut in half. Didn't get the hot peppers and my sandwich wasn't cut for me, the one thing I asked for. Not to mention the bread was hard as a rock. Go next door to Walmart save yourself some money and frustration"}
{"text":"I was driving through downtown Chandler and spotted this free standing location, the first I've ever seen for a JJs.   It's the usual Jimmy John's faire, but slightly less expensive ('bout 50 cents) than their Chandler Fashion location. Now I love JJs, but I need to take them down a half star for all the nonsense going on inside the store.    It's very much like the old high school cafeteria. Employees yelling at each other, goofing around and tunes dial up to ear splitting decibels, which makes it hard to enjoy a meal here.  We've all enjoyed high school once, once. Bueller? Bueller? Bueller?"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day and got the #5 Vito sandwich, which is basically an Italian club sandwich. It was pretty good and super quick."}
{"text":"What more can you say?  I visited on the annual $1 sub day.  While the line was out the door, it moved along breezily and within 10 minutes not only did I have two Unwich subs, I made some new friends, too.  Jimmy John's is a great little sub shop that fires on all cylinders.  Can't wait for pool season with the new, close by location . . . lots of deliveries for summer fun.  Call me a fan."}
{"text":"If ur looking for lettuce and bread only go to jimmy johns they are so cheap I payed an extra $2 for cheese no cheese maybe 5 slices of turkey absolutely horrible customer service the \"manager\" Matt didn't care at all!!!! Horrible place u guys don't even deserve a 1 Star I tried to get a district managers name or even number but they wouldn't give it to me and said when he has time he will call me TALK ABOUT AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"40min for a sandwich to be delivered not mind blowing like the radio said. I order here multiple times takes at least 40 to 50 min. Kinda sad. Sandwiches are good because you have to wait for so long you get hungrier."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place.. It took me a min to get my order down as far as what I like. How should I ordered and what my whole family likes it. I downloaded the app. And boy it's heavenly. They are freaky fast. The app keeps my order history and all I have to do is just click, click and click.. I order twice for pick up and the rest of the many times, I had them delivers so I can't Yelp on how clean the actual location is or how the customer service is. Their subs are yummy, freaky fast and very convenient so they can count on me on coming back!"}
{"text":"This location seems to struggle with too many calls from UNLV sometimes. But they have been awesome lately. I love them"}
{"text":"I love this place so much, and with the delivery to my work, I often eat here. The food is always good, the staff is lovely. The only complaint i have, is that with how often I order from Jimmy Johns, there's no rewards or loyalty program for valued clients. I probably order from here once or twice a week, as it's usually the only place I eat out at. I would love it so much better if there was some kind of consolation for buying so many sandwiches."}
{"text":"I usually wouldn't review a chain like JJ unless there is something specific to the location.  I ordered a couple of sandwiches ahead for carryout and got popped with a $2 \"delivery fee\".  Total BS.  I wish I would have noticed before I got home.  Boo!  Quit stealing money.  The sandwiches, of course, were JJ and pretty tasty with sweet bread.  Just beware here.  Don't order your sandwich ahead of time or they will rob you."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Jimmy John's in Pittsburgh. I work nearby, so it's easy to stop here and grab a quick lunch. Though the lines are enormous at lunch time during the week, the lines do move quickly. There is ample space inside as there is a lower level as well.  The veggie club is my absolute favorite. I'm sad that they have done away with the alfalfa sprouts, but at least the avocado spread is delicious and adds more to the sandwich than just an assortment of raw veggies. I enjoy getting the wheat bread instead of the usual roll (which is also delicious). The wheat bread is dense and has a delicious crunch to it because it is so stuffed with grains.  Come early during the week for lunch, or else after 1:30. This will ensure that you get a seat if you'd like to sit down rather than carry lunch back to the office."}
{"text":"Worst sandwich places ever! Who puts the meat last on a sandwich?!? The meat falls out of the sandwich constantly. Subway is just right across the street."}
{"text":"This is the worst Jimmy Johns I have been to. They mess up your order if you make special requests. I have been here twice and on both occasions they messed up my order. They gave me plain bread instead of the grain bread I ordered and on the second occasion forgot to add  cheese. Also the meat and bread was not fresh."}
{"text":"My work place and I order from this Jimmy Johns location more then we like to admit but at least every Monday and Friday and they are awesome to us. I was happy when chips some how didn't make it to my order (and wasn't charged for them) they still had a driver come back and deliver them to us.We love JJ's!"}
{"text":"The staff at this location (and all the other ones, I think) is energized and ready for your business. They like to do things quickly, so you'll have ordered and paid before you have time to think. About 30 seconds after that, your food will be ready.  Their food is great. The sandwiches are delicious and well-constructed. I know they have wheat bread and it's better for me...but the white bread is probably the best bread ever. Also, hot peppers on everything."}
{"text":"I go to this location often. They always do a great job.  I just picked up a couple sandwiches. #2 and #3.  They did an awesome job tonight. The place was extremely clean. The sandwiches are fantastic and the bread is so fresh.  Great job guys. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here twice now. the delivery is incredibly fast! only 10minutes from the moment I pressed the order button online! easy to order online. Both times, my order was exactly as I ordered :) the sandwiches are made well with enough ingredients to fill up the sub. ingredients are fresh and tasty! ... the bacon is not great, not crispy at all. My lettuce wrap was good. But both sandwiches were too salty, and that kinda ruins the taste for me. ... all in all I will definitely try them for a 3rd time, knowing to stress no salt. Great priced subs - you should thy them out!!"}
{"text":"Update: extra star added! Went back and dined in and the sub was much better, still not the best Jimmy's but I'll try again! I still feel like my sub could use way more substance since I do not get any meat!!!  *The one on Charleston was always great so maybe I'll check them out. Not as close to my house but if food is better always worth driving."}
{"text":"Ordered and 20 mins later no food. Call and told it was on it way 20 mins later. First time I order from this place and it will be my last. Had to go to jack in the box for food sad but true. If you are willing to wait half hour to get you food perfect place for you to go."}
{"text":"I order delivery a lot from here. They keep up to their freakishly fast delivery because I live so close.  Sandwiches are always great. I cannot think of any orders they have messed up or forgotten anything."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite thing about this place is how fast it is. They literally have your sandwich made in like 2 minutes, it's beautiful. And the sandwiches are really good. I've never been unhappy with Jimmy Johns, it's perfect for drunk food, sober food, all food. I even had it for breakfast once.  Rather than having to fuck around with specifying EXACTLY what you want while they take ages moving the stupid sandwich down the line like at some OTHER sub shops, Jimmy Johns already knows what you want and they are not time wasters with your dinner. Plus it's not too expensive, and sometimes they accidentally give you free cheese. Turkey Tom all the way!"}
{"text":"#9... full of meat! Hold the mayo, hold the cheese and add cucumbers! Sprouts are a must! I was so excited for our sandwich (only 2nd time ever trying this chain) that I forgot to get it on their delicious wheat, nutty bread! They offered to remake it in a heartbeat but, no way! I did not have the heart to see the sub go to waste. I will say, I felt guilty health-wise eating the white bread but it was fresh and quite good! It worked! Service was uppity and friendly. We love Jimmy John's!"}
{"text":"You guys suck im lactose intolerant and i asked for no cheese on my order i sit down and eat half my sandwich before realizing there is cheese so now not only am i going to have an upset stomach they also refused to give me a refund or even another sandwich they told me to take the cheese off like are you serious i just said im lactose intolerant"}
{"text":"Ok, 5 stars on the sandwiches but 2 stars at best on the friendliness of the staff so average of 3 stars.   Sandwiches are fresh, tasty, and absolutely yum. The service is FAST but I found the staff a bit unfriendly. This was my first visit and they weren't very helpful in explaining the menu at all. Also, they saw I was balancing a baby on my hip and knew I was dining in but had hidden the high chairs all the way in the very back of the restaurant so I didn't see them at first. I was actually trying to eat with the baby standing next to me in the booth. The cashier watched me with him and there was an employee who was cleaning tables who saw me and neither one mentioned the high chairs or offered to help me with my tray or anything. That's a downer for me. I did find the high chairs, but again, it was only after I just happened to catch sight of them all the way in the far corner of the restaurant.   I'll go back but it'll probably just be for take out."}
{"text":"If it weren't for average food, bad service and the dirty environment i'd have nothing to say but good about the place."}
{"text":"Another fabulously quick delivery.  Ordered #4 & #5 and as always they hit the spot.  While you can find great sub's made to order at other places, I like the taste of their rolls.  Did I say they have uber-quick delivery?  Freaky fast!"}
{"text":"My husband did a online order today for two sandwiches. When he got home with the sandwiches his was right but mine was a completely different sandwich. So I call and spoke to this guy and explain the situation and without saying anything to me he transfer the call to another guy who I guess was a manager. So I explain again and he asked me \" are you sure the order wrong\"???? Am I sure.... who asks that question. So he said he can remake it but can't deliver because it outside of his zone, and he can only give me credit not even a refund... wth... when I drive back over there I speak to the manager who want to argue with me on why he asked am I sure... then he didn't even offer a side, drink or dessert for the inconvenience... worst customer service ever. I LOVE jimmy johns but after that i don't know if I will return. Horrible"}
{"text":"Wow jimmy johns, you really failed me here. We love jimmy johns and eat at them pretty often, but this one was a fail. Both of our sandwiches were pretty much veggies and bread with no discernable taste of meat or cheese. I like a veggie sandwich but if I wanted one, I would have ordered it."}
{"text":"Look, I get it, service is fast here...but let me get in the door before you start asking me what I want to order. It's annoying to be asked \"what can I get for you\" before my body is even fully in the building."}
{"text":"Firstly, guy at the register with shirt unbuttoned wearing a big silver cross and surly attitude: Let me help you out on your people skills-- when a customer steps up, you say, \"Can I help you?\" or even \"What can i get you?\" You don't look blankly at him, like you're trying to do basic arithmetic.  Secondly, I hope Jimmy John's corporate catches on to the fact that your sandwiches are ripping people off. People spend hard earned money in your store and you send out crap sandwiches with what I would estimate as 50% of what they should have on them. Stores like this are the reason I choose Jersey Mike's 9 times out of 10.  Other than that, top notch place."}
{"text":"Delivered in 12 minutes. Freaky fast? YES!! If you are looking for a quick yummy sandwich youve found it. PS- if you haven't tried the chocolate chip cookies you're missing out!"}
{"text":"The owner of Jimmy John's shoots big game in Africa, killing many members of endangered species, all with a smile on his face. Pretty disgusting if you ask me. I used to love eating here until I found that out."}
{"text":"This is probably the most disgusting sandwich shop I've ever been to, found an ant in my sub."}
{"text":"Super fast delivery is an understatement.  I order lunch at least once a week. Rarely does it take more then 10mins to get to me. Always made how I like it and never any problems."}
{"text":"They make really good sandwhiches. I especially am fond of the bread and mayo plus the bigger size for a good price. My only complaints would be that every sjngle time ive gone in ive never been allowed the time to look at the menu. Even once i told the guy i had never been here and just wanted to look at the menu for a minute he kept going on and on and on about this one particular sandwhich telling me its the best one but i didnt like anything in it and he kept doing that instead of letting me look. Also the lwttuce can be a bit yellow anlt times but other than that its a good place to grab lunch"}
{"text":"I have tried three different Jimmy Johns in Champaign and prefer this one out of the three. Yes, it's connected to a gas station. Why that is a big factor for some, I do not know.  The one on Kirby is decent but the music is so loud. The one on Mattis avenue is does the least amount to give you good food, at a so-so speed and barely friendly to you as you come in.  What draws me to this one is that every time I walk in, I get greeted by the staff. Since I often order the same two sandwiches for my wife and I, certain crew members actually remember my usual order; even with the three extra items I add to my sandwich.  I can not comment on their delivery, since I do not live in the Champaign area. Maybe some day, someone will build one in Mahomet. That would be a change from the two Subways where the service is mostly substandard, but that is another review."}
{"text":"We visited Vegas last week and we ate here 4 times -__-. We live in LA and since my husband is from Chicago, this is his staple. He LOVES JJ's and I do too! we take advantage every time we visit, he usually gets the Gargantuan and I get the Beach club on wheat! I FREAKEN LOVE THE BREAD!! the staff is pretty nice too, I asked for day old bread and they gave me 2 for free!! I'll see you soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is super clean & super fast. I give it five stars I simply love fresh veggies. And at a reasonable price. Should you ask them to deliever they goodies they will but you won't wait all day they come quickly. Extra fresh fresh bread. Yey"}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns. No sandwich place comes near them. But specifically this location... WTF are these people listening to?! Every time I come here they play this awful death metal rock that make your veins in your head swell up.  It has to be take out or eat outside in the cold because of it.  Jimmy Johns is always 5 stars but this location is minus 5 just because of the loud and terrible music. Every time."}
{"text":"i've loved jimmy john's since i was in college.  the downtown cleveland location leaves much to be desired.  after ordering my sandwich for deliver i paid with a $20 and asked for $11 back.  the girl delivering told me she only had $10 on her.  now, i'm not complaining that i tipped an extra dollar but i'm a little angry that i was made to tip that much.  who sends employees out on deliveries and doesn't have them bring change so they can give the change that is asked for.  this is my second less than stellar experience at this location and i have to say i won't be going back."}
{"text":"I just love this place! My favorite sandwich shop, and this is now my new favorite location, because I had the best service from Leah! I've never had such great service before, and for that, i will always be a returning customer."}
{"text":"One of the things I miss from the Midwest is the choices available in gourmet sandwich shops. I've always thought there must be something in the water, but after reading the business section for many years you realize that the old adage about selling something in Peoria, IL is correct. Can you say test market?   The greater Chicagoland area had Jimmy John's, Jersey Mikes, Pot Bellies, Quizno's, et cetera over ten years ago. But, if you wait long enough sometimes things come to you. Jimmy's John's for the most part is a college sub shop (started many years ago in Elgin).  Which makes sense, because if you wanted one of their subs up until now you needed to drive down to Tempe and ASU.  But, that doesn't mean they're making poor quality subs -- they're actually making GREAT subs!  Their sandwiches are fresh, they use quality meats and seem to have learned the art of self-humor in their marketing: \"Subs so fast, you'll freak!\"  They actually merchandise this stuff!  Also, when you go, make sure you read their signage on the walls.   It's really very funny.  Great, great sandwiches -- Enjoy!  Now, all I need to do is wait a little longer for Pot Belly and Lou Malnati's to come to the Valley!  Hum, anyone want to take the over/under bet of 5 years?"}
{"text":"I would just like to preface this by saying that I have worked in the restaurant/food industry for the last 15 years.  Jimmy John's sandwiches are ok, nothing stupendous.  Their sign says \"free smells\" but all I can smell are cleaning products.  Every time I have been in this establishment (approximately 3 times, I have a friend who swears by the place), there are way more employees than customers.  They clean non-stop, which isn't a bad thing in terms of it being a very clean place.  However, they are always noisily pulling out tables and chairs, standing on chairs cleaning lamps, and other incredibly distracting things.  If I am trying to talk to someone and eat, it is hard to do when all I hear are the 15 employees talking and tables scraping across the floor.  Also, most of the employees that work the registers are not very genuinely friendly.  It seems like a forced effort, as though talking to you is the last thing they want to be doing.  We'll see how long they stay in business, but if they don't change some things, I can't imagine it will be long."}
{"text":"I ate at most of the sandwich place like Subway, Quiznos, Port of Subs, & Togo. I would say Jimmy Johns is the Best!!!! The bread and meats are again the Best!!!'"}
{"text":"So I'm a huge Jimmy Johns guy. Absolutely love Jimmy Johns. Despite the price being a little higher than most places for me it's worth the money and not too overpriced. Now, with all that being said, I've always ordered from the same location. I ordered from this location and felt like I got robbed. Literally. \"Freaky fast delivery\" does not equal an hour and twenty minute wait. Even during lunch. If you're busy and don't have the man power then hire more people. This location is on campus, hiring people shouldn't be difficult whatsoever. So I finally got my food and the bad and sandwiches were completely smashed and partly wet from maybe outside air...? Wasn't raining so one of the subs was ruined. Don't really understand how a bag gets this smashed up and damaged but apparently it's possible. The delivery guy was fairly decent but somewhat rude but not worth mentioning too much. I've reached out and filed a formal complaint so we'll see how this pans out but I may never go back. We'll see. Kinda hard to see it in the pic, but the sandwiches were smashed all to hell."}
{"text":"I order from here a lot I love this place,  I am on a diet in they where so awesome to meet my restrictions and super nice about it. I will continue to order from this place, no matter when or what I order everyone is always so sweet! I appreciate calling in not getting a attitude like some place.  Thanks keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This store just opened up like in January of this year. Ive been working at Smiths pharmacy for almost 6 years the manager Jordan is a real dick and he is so rude!!!! He was trying to tell me I can not park my car in front of his store. First of all my i purchase a new car in 2-2015 my car got hit in the Smiths parking lot 6 months after I got it and ever since than Ive been parking my car over by the Jimmy Johns/Wingstop area. At that time Jimmy Johns wasnt even over there. The Joint and than it was Verizon and they never had an issue with me parking my car over there. The manager Jordan threaten to tow my car if I did not move it. There is no signs where it says I can not park my car there. It is not private property if I am employee here and there is no sign saying private property.Jordan is a miserable man that probably has not gotten any sex within months and he is taking his fustration out on me for no reason. I will most def address this matter to their coporate office.  I will tell all my friends on IG and Facebook not to eat there. What kind of business offer \"free smells\" to get customers to buy there dry ass sandwiches. My friend order food from them one time and they didnt have her order ready and she order her food 30 minutes before she went to lunch and it was not even ready when she got there. I will continue my business with Firehouse Sub and Subway. Talk about rude services!!! If your \"so called parking space\" is apart of your lease why couldnt you show your paper work to our store manager where are the signs where it states only Jimmy Johns customer parking only?? Falles Vales, our smoke shop has their signs for their customers parking.  I believe Applebee's have them as well. If Smiths employee cant park their car in front of Jimmy John then Jimmy John's employees should be able to park their car in the Smith's parking lot. I wouldnt recommend this Nellis and Stewart Jimmy Johns to anyone."}
{"text":"every time i order from them it takes more than 30 min and i live less than a mile away. my order is always right minus one time that was wrong"}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns has got to be my guilty pleasure. Love the Beach Club and the salt and vinegar chips. This location is fairly new and it does the JJ chain well. Although they do keep the music louder than I'd like. Great place, great sandwiches."}
{"text":"Don't ever order at lunch as it will take a minimum of one hour for your food to get to you. They are very slow, unprofessional, and could care less about correcting your screwed up order.  You will never get a napkin with your order, even if you asked for one. There must be a shortage of napkins in the United States that I wasn't aware of. I have ordered from this location a minimum of 20 times and it has slowly going downhill."}
{"text":"I waited 50 MINUTES for them to deliver my sandwich. I could have gotten a pizza quicker. unbelievable."}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich from here last week because my coworker was raving about this place & their speedy delivery. She was correct on the speedy delivery, it was at our building pretty fast. I ordered The Beach Club, which is suppose to have double the meat of a regular sandwich. I would hate to imagine how little meat the regular sandwiches have. It was also suppose to come with avacodo. It barely had a smudge. The sandwich itself was okay. Nothing I would rant or rave about. I rather eat at subway. However, if im at work and not in the mood to drive I might consider ordering in. It's more convenient just not as tastey."}
{"text":"I just ordered a #4 Turkey Tom sandwich and it was most skimpie sandwich I have ever received from any Jimmy Johns store. My sandwich today has only half of the amount of toppings as it would normally get. I am incredibly dissatisfied with my order today and will not be returning to this store."}
{"text":"Lettuce, tomatoes, onions and cheese smacked between thick white bread.  It's nothing amazing, but gets the job done for this vegetarian.  Meh, 3 stars."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if i could they totally suck at their delivery  They could call and let you know that placing an order at 6:54 pm wont get you your order till after 8:22 pm with no phone call the samwhich is what it is a samwhich  but it is the management and drivers or lack there of delivery drivers  Their speedy fast time is a big joke I think the thing they need to do is at least let the people know how long the delivery is  And to not gave snippy girls to  answer the phone if they dont understand that it is called delivery or pick up your choice this is ridiculous  They can keep their free smells i will never order from you again"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. The people who work here are great, but it has been so hit and miss throughout the years. During busy times (like lunch), they've given the sandwich I've ordered away more times than I can count.   But my biggest complaint is that, if you order an unwitch, they only put use one measly piece of lettuce. This is supposed to replace the bread, folks! I've never been to a Jimmy John's that does such a terrible job with their unwitches. It's so frustrating, because it's such an easy fix. Please, add more lettuce to your unwitches and figure out a system (like giving each customer a number) so that you don't give away people's sandwiches!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, were us mid-westerners excited to see Jimmy John's here in Tempe!  It's a staple in Michigan, and for a reason.  They do it right!  I love the \"Slim\" options, which are plain subs without the meat (\"Slim 6\") or veggies for us picky ones.  I'm not sure what everyone else ordered because I was scarfing down mine...but all were happy!    Service was fast and friendly too.  Now, if only we get get some of the people chowing on burgers and fries next door at 5 Guys to come over and order a healthy sub instead!"}
{"text":"I have no complaints. As advertised, the subs are prepared ridiculously quick. Preparing food so fast, you would expect mistakes; however, I have yet to encounter one. They handle special orders perfectly.  It's very clean every time I go in! This is a huge plus!  Prices are decent. Not amazing but also not anything to complain about.   Customer service is also decent. I wouldn't say it's a highlight, but none of the associates are ever rude."}
{"text":"NEW LOCATION!  Just as good as you would expect at any Jimmy John's location.  Very fast service and very clean.  It's about time they opened a location on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Freaky fast is apparently code for slow and inaccurate. I placed an order at 6:19pm according to the online confirmation, 35 minutes later I got a call that one of their delivery drivers was having car trouble and they were sending someone out \"right now.\" No offer to do anything other than complete my order. My order wasn't delivered until over 30 minutes later.  And it was wrong! Instead of my club sandwich, I had a plain ham sandwich with cheese. When I called the store and told them it was the wrong order, Andrew (apparently the assistant manager), first argued with me and made me double check it. When he was finally satisfied that I wasn't lying to him, he said they would make me a new sandwich and deliver it \"when we can.\" He also said that I needed to rewrap my incorrect sandwich and would need to return it to the delivery driver. He was very explicit about this.  At this point I expressed my frustration that not only did my order take over an hour to arrive, it was wrong, and I had no idea when my new sandwich would arrive. He told me that there had been a number of things that were \"out of their control\" tonight and that it wasn't their fault or anything they can do about it.  At no time did he apologize for the errors, offer me anything for my wasted time, offer to provide a refund if I wanted to cancel my order. Nothing.   It took two tries and 90 minutes to get a sandwich. Freaky fast indeed."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location a few times, and every time I order its either wrong or takes forever to deliver. You'd think management or corporate would have jumped in at this point with all reviews being very similar issues. I LIVE UNDER A QUARTER MILE from this location and it's going on 50 minutes to deliver and still no food!  Edit* Finally delivered and it was wrong sandwich, no drink, no chips."}
{"text":"Ordered a  lettuce wrap and requested to have it cut in half.  This is more like a giant lettuce taco.  And it's it not cut in half."}
{"text":"I will never go to this Jimmy John's location AGAIN. As I'm waiting for my sandwiches I overhear one of the managers i think named Dustin, talking to another co-worker about engaging in sexual activity with a younger employee. Yea so what, right?? Well I'm a father of two teenage girls. The sickening part is that most girls at Jimmy John's are barely 18 and this guy was probably close to 40. I've reached out to corporate and lemme tell you, that's next to impossible. The owners are supposedly out of town, but they'll be hearing from me. PLEASE don't let your daughter work around such a filthy, disrespectful animal....The food is overpriced for what you get, I'll pick port of subs any day over Jimmy John's!!"}
{"text":"I love their subs! They always make them really fast and the prices aren't too bad. I also like that they have cherry peppers. Most sub places don't have them."}
{"text":"At last a sandwich spot that is not a last resort when you run out of ideas of where to go for lunch. The traits of their bread are masterly perfected to reduce sogginess all while having a slight chew. My favorite as of yet is the #9 Italian Night Club. It's what a true Italian sandwich should be sans a few bells a whistles. Portions are fairly generous and likewise the prices. As of yet, the service is beyond par and I hope for it to remain that way. Not quite Potbelly's but good enough. One caveat, make sure to not get a whiplash while watching how fast your sandwich gets made."}
{"text":"Customer service was poor.  I stated that it was my first time there to the guy taking my order. He was no help.  I noticed after placing my order and waiting for my sandwich to be made that you can ask for it to be jimmied up or whatever they call it he didn't even offer that to me. Then I was the only customer in the building and when my sandwich was finished being made the young girl was calling out \"number two\" while I was looking at the menu on the wall and then proceeds to say \"anyone number 2\" instead of saying to me excuse me your sandwich is ready. Sad to say I will never go back. Sandwich has really no flavor anyways. I will stick to Jersey Mike's where they are welcoming,  helpful and their sandwiches have flavor."}
{"text":"Whoever the manager is needs to staff better.  Only two guys and a girl staffed at 6pm with multiple (5)guests ahead of me waiting for orders.  Waited over 15 minutes for 2 easy sandwiches.  Ridiculous.  The crew were working as fast as they could and being very friendly.  Don't stick your employees understaffed while the manager isn't there.  A captain goes down with his ship."}
{"text":"Like any Jimmy John's, the Streetsboro location is a superior sub experience. No, they don't have a ton of toppings. If that's important to you, try Subway. However, the meats they use are great (ham is best) and I love the sub rolls. The restaurant is clean, service is fast. I don't think $6.50 for a great sub is asking too much."}
{"text":"Freaky Fast.  Their tag line says it all.  In fact, I get stressed out walking in there if I haven't already decided what I want to order.  So, I learned, and now I carefully study the menu before walking over.  Other than that, I can't complain.  Is it the best sub I've ever had?  No, but it's WAY better than Subway, Cousins or the Quzino's they replaced.    I didn't know they would cut the pickle in half when I ordered the giant pickle as my side.  That was disappointing to me - I wanted my pickle un-cut.  This might be the sole reason they only get 3 stars from me."}
{"text":"I'm surprised about all the negative reviews about this location.  We found them to be very friendly and accommodating. Heavily staffed, for sure - I think 4 guys made my sandwich.  Love Jimmy John's bread and the humorous decor. Got to learn facts about Uranus while sitting on the toilet. Nice."}
{"text":"Great sub, located at a very convenient location, great ambience and awesome customer service! They were quick with my order took only 6 minutes for me to get my food."}
{"text":"Save your money and go somewhere else. Freakishly slow delivery time. Three out of three times, it has taken over 30 minutes for my food to be delivered. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"They make you feel weird if you come too often, they seem to only want orders that come in the slofin'. They could be nicer and friendlier I'm sure, they could, but they're young and they don't understand that they should. The surface it seems, needs vast improvement. The subs, however, Are much on the movement!"}
{"text":"First time to Jimmy Johns, won't be returning! A bland, tasteless sandwich. Bread was dry. Subway is far better!"}
{"text":"Love this location! Seriously defines \"freaky fast\" when I order delivery. I love the #12 beach club and their salt and vinegar chips. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"The staff had no problem serving us a few minutes after closing - Definitely fast and i love the ultimate porker.. a great option when heading back to cave creek after a hockey game!"}
{"text":"The bread is so soft and delicious. The only thing I hate is that you can't build your own sandwich. I usually get the #9 but half of the stuff I don't like on it. So I'm paying for things that aren't even on the sandwich. That's one aspect in which Subway is better.!"}
{"text":"Do not.  Ever.  Go to this location!  Waited for 20 mins (no joke and not an exaggeration) for a sandwich for my son between performances.  They're inept, don't care, and just handed me a loaf of their dried out bread from the display even as I cut a promo on them.   I left with their bead so my son had something, and they kept my $8.  Never again, Jimmy John's.   Wow..."}
{"text":"Just called this location and I live 1.8 miles away. I asked them to deliver and they informed me that they would not deliver to my house because it was a couple hundred yards out of the map plan. They asked me to call the power and southern store. This store advised me that they could not deliver because jimmy johns has a two mile radius they can deliver to.  Called this store back and they once again decided to tell me even though I was in the two mile radius they did not want to deliver to me and my only option was for pickup. I will never eat at this location. I know the owners at Firehouse Subs and they go out of the way and this location is just lazy. Not getting my money jimmy johns no matter how fast you are. Laziness is worse"}
{"text":"Excellent Service I come here all the time. Ryan is a great employee always friendly, polite and very professional. My sub is always made very fast and accurate."}
{"text":"Best sub place in North Scottsdale.   The french bread is awesome. Haven't tried the 7 grain bread yet but will do so soon. The meat and veggies are extremely fresh and tasty.   The menu choices are simple but what they do, they do extremely well. The price and portions are right and it is a much better alternative for a quick healthy lunch than going to Subway or Quizno's.  The sandwich pickup process leaves a little to be desired but they do make the sandwiches extremely quick so you're not left waiting very long."}
{"text":"Fastest service I ever had. My sandwich is ready as soon as I order out every time. Great quality. I haven't been to a Subway or Port of Subs since they opened this location."}
{"text":"Great service but a small venue. Outside tables makes for perfect accessibility"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Jimmy Johns. The staff is always friendly.  I love the fact that they deliver.  Get tired of having pizzas delivered.  The drivers are nice and have conversations with you instead of sign this and they're out.  The delivery time is always quick. Less than 20 min.  The place is always clean and all their food is fresh and their bread....awesome!  I like using their mobile app as well."}
{"text":"One Mississipi.... Two Mississipi.... Three Mississipi........Holy $H!T they're here already! Whether you are getting it delivered or ordering in store Jimmy John's is the fastest gun in the West. Insanely efficient and incredibly delicious. Jimmy John's never disappoints with the food or service, and prices on par with the major chains. If you are a fan of the toasted sub (as I am) next time you are considering Quiznos, or Port of Subs, skip it and hit up Jimmy John's, especially if you are in a hurry! I still give the crown to Capriotti's for Chain Sandwich shop, but Jimmy John's is definitely a close second. I recommend the Big John extra toasted (for the carnivore) or The Beach Club (if you like something lighter)."}
{"text":"I like the food at Jimmy Johns but this location has given me the completely wrong sandwich 2 out of 6 trips. I now have to make them repeat the order and then check it before I leave the drive-through. I think the employees at this location should probably be working at the Cheba Hut in the same center (if you get my drift)."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches as always! Very fresh and service is always great!  Also since this is right by our house we've also had their freakishly fast delivery too and It did Not disappoint! Jimmy John's on Rural Road in Tempe Rules!"}
{"text":"I love their sandwiches .... but as a previous Yelper reviewed, their delivery area is ridiculous.   I hold events at the Savoy Rec Center, and their corporate headquarters (and also the closest JJ's...) isn't even 3 miles away..... apparently they can't drive there.     They have billboards ALL over Champaign-Urbana saying, \"FREAKY, FAST DELIVERY\".... but if you live out of the delivery range, then you are out of luck.   It's ridiculous....  Savoy is literally a mile away from the \"Champaign\" border whatever that means (Windsor Rd??) .... you are cutting out a lot of business by not delivering to Savoy --- Savoy Rec Center?  Willard Airport??   The golf course at Willard??  All of those apartment complexes down there??  Come on Jimmy Johns!?!  Give me a break."}
{"text":"For a sandwich place, it was great. They have a drive through that really was \"freakishly fast\" from the time we ordered to as we were paying. There was no line and our order was exactly what we placed. The \"skinny\" sandwich takes out all the \"exras\" but still keeps the bread and main inside (ex. Tuna and bread but no lettuce) so it doesn't really reducd the calorie count. Nice service."}
{"text":"I've often laughed at the fact that people write reviews for fast food chains, but two big fat middle fingers to the Jimmy John's franchise that permanently soiled my opinion of all other Jimmy John's franchises. I already found the chain shady at best due to its founder's love of big game hunting, but tonight I found myself in a pinch and decided that I could temporarily put my principles aside to feed the family \"freaky fast.\" After ordering $30 worth of food I asked for two cups of water. I was told I would have to PAY for them. Seriously, shame on you for your greed. I've never in my life been asked to pay for dirty-ass AZ tap water. I also ordered a sandwich with no mayo because my youngest child is allergic to mayo. Her \"no mayo\" wrapper of course contained a sandwich that had mayo. Good thing we caught it, because the worst ting I'm going to do about it is write reviews wherever I can. Jimmy John's on Mill, COME ON!"}
{"text":"These sandwiches taste like the inside of a sad refrigerator.  I ordered a sandwich online and customized it to include vito meat, and the \"sandwich artist\" didn't include the vito meat, and I didn't realize it until halfway through the sandwich.  I called hoping to have the $1.75 refunded or some comparable arrangement. The manager told me they would send another sandwich out. When I told him that half the sandwich was gone he said \"the policy\" is they need the entire sandwich to fix *their* error. I reiterated that this was their bad, not mine, but alas."}
{"text":"Stay Away!  Horrible customer service (in store)!  Rude cashier and front staff."}
{"text":"We order delivery for work all of the time from this JJs.  When it first opened, the kids  that worked there were so ridiculous, we didn't order for a while.  But the staff they have now is much better.  Delivery drivers are always nice and usually fast.  Unless its lunch time.  I have waited over 30 min for a sandwich but I kind of expect that during lunch rush hour. I have had to call a few times and have my sandwich remade or send me the chips they forgot.  But usually I don't have any problems.  When I do though, they fix it SUPER fast.    Their sandwiches are just REALLY REALLY good!"}
{"text":"Not only were the sandwiches super yummy...but the kids that work there are pretty fun.  We are a couple of nerds and entered our online order names as Gandalf and Sarumon.  When my husband walked in to pick them up the young man who was working (8:30pm Sunday night) greeted my husband with enthusiams!! This will be our go-to spot from now on   You can go anywhere to get a sandwich.  But because of this kids rockin attitude...this will be our go to spot!!  Great job on customer satisfaction!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously only .5 miles away from this location. I order my sandwich 35 minutes ago. And it's not even rush hour. I do thank Joey for calming me down but the time is ridiculous. It is also just not that incident. In the past, 3 times in a row. I have recieved the wrong freaking sandwich. Other times, it took almost my whole lunch to receive my food. The area manager John needs to get his work together. This location is already having poor reviews."}
{"text":"Drive through is nice, and fast.  They have no knives.  They have no lemon for tea.  You get exactly what is on the menu as described.  You can leave something off but can't have it on the side.  $25 for 3 sandwiches, 2 chips and 1 drink."}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of subs/hoagies/heros, however...I really genuinely like Jimmy John's. Consistent, fresh, tasty, and a good value. I always seem to get the same sandwich (Beach club). But, I really like it.  They really value their customers and are always pleasant. Never a long wait. It's always well kept and delivery is amazingly fast!!1"}
{"text":"I will never cease to be amazed by how quickly they deliver. I ordered online last time and I barely had enough time to put pants on before they showed up! I've never had problems with my orders and everyone is always friendly. Jimmy John's is perfect for students!  Also, thank god there is no way to \"check in\" when you're getting delivery. Otherwise I would be ashamed at how often I have them deliver!"}
{"text":"I unfortunately did not enjoy my sub.  I got the #5 Vito which rang up to $5.98 that's a good price for an 8in sub, but the bread was flat and little hard. Signage in the store read it's fresh baked but really it could have been  shipped in 3 days prior and I wouldn't have known the  difference. The bread for me really makes or  breaks the sub.  I want a soft bread that's gentle on the gums lol.  I don't want to be made to feel that I am working through hard bread to get to the inner goodies of my sandwich and that's exactly how I felt.   Jimmy John's Vito as I remember it was lettuce, tomato, salami, ham,  and capicola. Your standard three meat trio hoagie, but really no care what into making the sandwich at all.   The only two saving graces for this location is that there is amble sitting and also they sale day old loaves of bread for .50.  I purchased two day old loaves and made french toast the following morning.    I'll be back for more day old bread, but certainly not for meal."}
{"text":"Brought the family here tonight for the $1 sandwich night.  It was our first visit to this Jimmy John's location.  There was a huge line out the door and wrapping around the corner, but it moved quickly.  I like the bread here and eat my sandwiches pretty plain, so I like Jimmy John's.   Not sure why 'Gourmet' is part of the logo, since there's nothing gourmet about this place."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend are hooked on the gargantuan sandwich ! I love adding the avocado spread but I noticed if I don't eat it that day it's just not the same if I have any leftovers! But other than that it's huge and has literally every meat you can think of on there!"}
{"text":"It's sooooo incredibly annoying when places won't take cash past a $20 bill.  I had a modest size order and had a $50 with me.  I was told that they wouldn't take my cash but eventually they relented when I made the case that it's legal tender from the govt....hated having to make that point but shouldn't have to"}
{"text":"The workers at this location suck. The tall dark-skinned dude that takes your order doesn't say a word. Doesn't greet you, doesn't ask what you'd like, doesn't tell me my total, just stares at me until I hand him my payment. Doesn't say thanks, won't even tell you if your foods ready. I once sat there for 10 minutes waiting for my food, while it had been sitting there the whole time because no one told me it was ready.  Then there's the 'manager' guy that looks like he should be working at a Game-Stop, with the attitude to boot. Arrogant and a little rude...you work at a Jimmy John's, man. Chill it with the attitude. The only ones that seem decent are the girls and the guy running around in the background, not taking orders. The only reason I have to deal with these goons is because they won't deliver to my house, 3-MILES AWAY.  Needless to say, I'm over this location and it workers. I'll be going to the location down Harris Blvd, closer to Northlake from now on.  I gave the extra star because it's Jimmy John's and the foods good."}
{"text":"Best sandwich I've had in Vegas, can't wait to come back!  I got the roast beef #10.  It was amazing."}
{"text":"Crappy service coupled with really bad sandwiches they make subway look like gourmet.  It's no wonder there's never a line at that place"}
{"text":"What's the point in priding your selves on being able to make a sandwich freaky fast when you can't get a one sandwich order right"}
{"text":"We've been in the pat couple of nights and last week and we always have great service and good customer service. Always very quick in giving you your order. I would recommend."}
{"text":"The subs seem more like sandwiches and their sandwiches are rather sub par.  You're really better off driving past this location and spending your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"America please be jimmy John. By the time I paid for the sandwich it was done. I'm not used to fast service. If I go to subway I have to watch them spend 20 minutes dragging their feet. I get mad and think about perhaps bombing the place. But... they are all like that so it wouldn't make a difference. We need that jimmy John spirit every where from food places to DMV  Btw sandwich was ok. Nothing to die for but I have low expectations so..."}
{"text":"I wish there were less stars I could give.  The person took my order but not my last name or telephone number.  I stood in front of my office for 35 minutes so I wouldn't miss the delivery.  Came back inside my office and called jimmy johns. Oh, sorry, they said, we didn't know how to get in touch with you and we don't deliver to your address.  This is less than one mile away.  Jimmy John's sucks."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep ordering from here. This was the last time. Freaky fast? More like freaky inaccurate.  The first time I ordered from here for delivery the guy came on bicycle. By the time he arrived the soda was flat from being shaken, the cup, bag and receipt were dripping with soda all over everything, and my order was missing the cookie, tomato on the sandwich, and mayo packets. To make matters worse my card was charged twice and it took 3 phone calls, and daaaaaays to get it refunded with no apology for the inconvenience.  I gave them another shot today and once again I was missing mayo packets (Yumm! A dry sandwich!) and everything was dripping with soda on it. The receipt I signed was torn, half missing, and wet with soda. It was disgusting and NOT professional!  I paid for avocado spread on my sandwich and there was one tiny blob on there."}
{"text":"I placed an order online and am in the hospital with family so I couldn't go pick it up and gave directions to call or email me. Nothing happened. I walk out to the lobby and watch the delivery by walking away. I call the store and that guy says they will let him know when he gets back. I said why would you not call him and stop him now? So I sit in the lobby for 15 minutes. He comes back and is SUPER rude to me tells me to sign something and has no pen. I find a pen for him and he takes the receipt and storms away. Then to top it off when I get back to the room I look and all the extras I asked for are not on my sandwich. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!"}
{"text":"I've had pretty average service at this location before, but recently it has been terrible. Incorrect orders, orders missing items I requested, and ridiculously slow delivery times. Guess I won't be ordering from this location anymore."}
{"text":"Please look at a photo I have posted on this business of a POC I am friends with who I was treated with racism by an employee of this establishment. No business will be given to any such place that has employees who make such foul remarks. This person needs to be fired before I ever give my business to them."}
{"text":"When I first told my friend I was going to review this place, he sort of scoffed at me and said \"What, you're going to review Jimmy John's? That's like reviewing McDonalds.\" ... Except, I can promise that the food is 10x better. Plus, cut me some slack--there aren't any Jimmy John's in the west coast. My experience with Jimmy Johns was a box lunch that included an Italian sandwich, barbecue-flavored chips, a dill pickle, and a oatmeal raisin cookie.   1. Sandwich: The bread was my favorite part--and I normally hate un-toasted bread. The italian comes stuffed (as in I had trouble squeezing in my potato chips) with various thinly-cut deli meats. 2. Barbecue Chips: These Jimmy John chips almost deserve 4 stars on their own. (Actually if you've been reading my past few reviews, I've had a strange bbq-flavor theme going on). Crispy, flavorful, unhealthy. They're awesome. Just get them. I wouldn't eat my sandwich any other way.  3. Pickle: Not interesting.  4. Cookie: Dessert is the best way to finish a meal and although this cookie could have been chewier, I liked that it wasn't overly sweet.   I can't quite review the location since I did get it on the go. However, I really enjoyed the sandwich with chips and the prices are pretty cheap for a full lunch. P.s. I tried the roast beef and I much prefer the italian."}
{"text":"Rude, all I have to say is everyone who works at this location is very rude and very disrespectful, especially Tyler and most of all Charlene. I was almost in tears after the way she spoke to me. All I was trying to do was find out where my driver was since its was taking 45 minutes to get my sandwich and I only live 0.8 miles away. After 2.5 years of having deliveries made to me, they all of sudden won't deliver 20 feet further to the Optima CamelView because it's \"out of their delivery zone\" which is across the street from the Harkins/Macy's parking lot, which is in their delivery zone. The delivery man, who is the nicest man btw, thinks this was BS also because he has delivered to me many times and explained to me they even sometimes make deals with people and deliver to even further places. He also mentioned sometimes Tyler (who is the shift manager) just sometimes decides not to deliver certain places because \"he just doesn't feel like it\".  I will be contacting corporate tomorrow to file another complaint on this location. It's so sad that people can behave this way."}
{"text":"Really delicious and they deliver.  I have plenty left over for lunch tomorrow.  The sandwich was perfectly made and the pickle was the high quality deli kind."}
{"text":"Finding myself at Sycamore Commons after an early morning of running errands, dodging the church traffic and standing in line at Costco for an eternity, I was hangry (hungry + angry) and needing something to eat post haste.  I was heading towards McAlister's (I don't frequent Sycamore Commons and knew there was a McAlister's there) when I saw Jimmy John's.  I like subs.  Let's try that!  I was the only non-employee in there (Sunday at 11:30 am) and stood there for a minute staring at the menu.  Why do you name the subs?  It's not a cat - it's a sub.  If it has ham and cheese on it, call it friggin' ham and cheese.  And if it doesn't have bacon on it, it's not a club sandwich in my mind.  Anywho... once I got over my short-bus confusion, I ordered #7 ham and cheese on their french bread, a bag of BBQ chips and a chocolate chip cookie to go (was headed to the parentals).  Not to be confused with the #1 Pepe, which is also ham and cheese... whatever.  Luckily, it's a small menu or I could have been there all morning.    The bread was fresh and soft without being mushy - the middle is soft while the outside is sturdier but not crunchy.  Hard to explain, but it was good.  This isn't subway where you have 100 toppings - mine came with lettuce and mayo (tomato is also included but I am not a fan of the maters).  Smoked ham was sliced thin and was tasty, provolone was also thinly sliced.  The lettuce was in shreds and fresh, no bad pieces at all.  The chips were tasty and crunchy and a relatively big bag.  The chocolate chip cookie was big and soft-ish, pre-packaged in cellophane, so it was exactly what I was expecting.  I think the sandwich, chips and cookie were less than $10.    I took a menu on my way out to pass along to the parentals, since they are right down the street and saw that they deliver too (although I didn't see the rules for delivery).  Good stuff, it was a nice change from Subway and I would definitely eat there again.  Update 2/18/13:  While I found the food to be quite good, I just read some articles on how the owner/founder of the chain prefers to spend the money from the subs I purchase to hunt exotic animals.  So, this location keeps the 4 stars for the meal I had because they deserve that, but lost a customer based on the practices of the founder."}
{"text":"First of all, the sandwiches at Jimmy John's are almost always great.    So why only 2 Stars?    1. Will they deliver, or will they not?  Depends on the day, and who answers the phone.  We live 1 neighborhood street too far for them to deliver (100 feet or so), unless we don't, as sometimes they will come to our house and sometimes they won't.  They will literally deliver to 50% of our neighborhood, but not the other 50% (even if that means they have to drive by houses they won't deliver to, to deliver to houses within whatever \"circle\" they actually deliver to).  This after delivering to us on multiple occasions. 2. Tables are almost always grubby.  They need to have someone on table wiping duty.   3. Very loud place.   4. If you pay with MasterCard chip card, you will have to manually enter all of your credit card info.    I eat (or should I say ate) in the JJ's at least a couple of times a week, and I am sure they will be fine without my business, but their lack of consistency on whether we can count on them or not is the final straw.  During the summer we are all hanging out at the pool having adult type beverages, so delivery is a necessity.  That leaves us with pizza........again."}
{"text":"We go to this JJ once a month since they opened and never had any problems until our order was wrong. When I called the lady sounded pissed off at me (I was being nice too). Then she hung up on me. If your not a people person DO NOT ANSWER THE PHONE."}
{"text":"This Jimmy John's is always fast and has my sometimes complicated orders accurate. Thank you for the consistent service :-)"}
{"text":"There always down drivers and delivery takes for ever.. I'd love to tip them but they make it hard. Sandwiches are either a hit or a miss."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is still the least expensive, best tasting Sub/sandwich option near the Chandler Fashion mall.    Over the last six months, all the sub places in the area have been pushing through small price increases and now, they've just completed a second round. We're talking $0.25-50 (twice) for the most part. So, a JJ's premium sandwiches is now $6.50 and with a soft drink and taxes, the bill comes to $8.65 or so.  The other so called premium sub places, like Which Wich and Firehouse are all $2.00 more, with about the same amount of meat (3 to 4 oz) as you would find here.  While Jersey Mike's is the only one that continues to give you more cold cuts for your extra change.  Now processed meats aren't good for you, or so I have been told. So everything in moderation, right?  But how good is Jimmy John's?  Well, one unscientific survey has a JJs delivery driver arriving every ten minutes during lunch at my office and we have cafeteria with a Starbucks! LOL. Enuf said."}
{"text":"After discovering that Jimmy John himself takes my money and goes big game hunting, killing elephants and giraffes' for fun, I will never eat a Jimmy Johns again"}
{"text":"This place is so gross!  Stale bread, rude employees and a boring sandwich makes for a place we will never visit again. Sorry jimmy you will never see another dollar from me.  Go to jersey mikes it's way better!"}
{"text":"This rating is for this location specifically. Billed as \"freaky fast\", it's anything but. I've never received my order in less than 30 minutes and usually wait an hour despite being 2 minutes away. I've never had this issue with any other location."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why JJ's is so popular in other parts of the country.  It is just your average sandwich shop.  Here is my rundown:  * #14 Bootlegger Club = very good and the meat looked to be less processed than some other sandwich places. * Pickle = huge and good * Hot peppers = excellent and they totally made my sandwich. * Chips = very good.  not too oily or salty.  I ordered the sandwich \"unwich\" style where they wrap it in lettuce instead of using bread.  Not many places do this so I was impressed.  It was a bit difficult to eat though.  I guess the big thing is that they deliver and are open until 3am.  Not sure I'll take advantage much but it is good to know.  Anyway, they do make a pretty solid sandwich.  It was worth the 6 bucks or so."}
{"text":"So you walk into this location, and it is over staffed. And as I walked in, I was expecting bad service and attitude (yes, I judge books by their covers).  But I was pleasantly surprised, the young men were so friendly and joking (good personalities).    The sandwiches are awesome. My daughter and I order different clubs.  I add cucumber to mine.  Let me just say there is soooo much meat, it hangs off the bread. Speaking of the bread, it is phenomenal.   Our new favorite subs in the area."}
{"text":"This sandwich shop is close to my work. When I don't have time for a full lunch break, I have them deliver me a sandwich. The sandwiches are decent, they are extremely fast, and they have never screwed up an order. They could be cheaper, as ordering a meal or extras on your sandwich can get overly expensive. In all, they are a great option for a fast healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Always a great sandwich (especially for a chain store) with quick and friendly service. Will continue to visit on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed tonight it took almost 50 minutes to get my food if I'd known it was gonna take longer than normal I'd ordered pizza if I was gonna wait almost an hour for a cold sandwich. I order from this location pretty frequently and this time around I'm not happy."}
{"text":"This location is terrible!!! It took them 50 minutes to deliver one sub and a bag of chips!! After waiting 25 minutes I called and some kid answered and when I asked how much longer he said \"umm well it was assigned 20 minutes ago so umm i don't actually know\" so I said okay.... and he said okay... and I hung up. Finally someone gets there to drop off my sub and he did say sorry for the wait..: but honestly that is absolutely ridiculous when they are less than half a mile away!!!! Not ordering from them again"}
{"text":"Oh, heaven have mercy, why have I waited so long!  This location of Jimmy John's opened up pretty recently (of course, to my addled brain 'recently' can mean about 5 years ago, but I'm sure this has been within the last year) and I'm pretty bummed I hadn't made the short trip there yet to get one of their yummy sandwiches.  Now, I like sandwiches as much as the next guy (unless you're Joey from Friends - it doesn't go THAT far) but I'm not a big fan of Subway or Port of Subs and the like.  Their meats are grody to me, frankly.  Their breads are never as fresh as I hope they would be, and frankly I'm a little scared of anyone with \"Sandwich Artist\" embroidered on their shirt.  Jimmy John's has none of this stuff.  I gad a turkey club on seven grain wheat bread.  The bread was cut into big, thick slices that were soft and fresh and tasty.  The turkey didn't look sickly or have a thin coating of goo like the other places have, the lettuce and tomato were both colorful and fresh tasting, and the bacon was thick sliced and generous.  I got a bag of BBQ chips that were also thick cut and yummers and a soda and was out of there for under $9.     As a bonus, this location is in a strip mall where the suites have two levels, and all the seating is upstairs in a cute little dining area with awesome red lamps."}
{"text":"So I tried out this place 7 times before over a 2 year span. Customer service has always sucked.. Hate to say it but true and true again tonight.  If you don't  want to work  somewhere  get out and move on. A lot of people would appreciate you all have.  Anyways the bun was so hard and stale   Just another awful experience with them.  Who the F owns such a shitty company in our city."}
{"text":"I live 1.96 miles away in Ballantyne area. I visited jimmy john's website and tried to order for delivery for the first time. I have never tried this restaurant before. Was told they do not deliver here. Less than 2 miles? Wth? I see the vehicles with the Jimmy John's signs on top pass my street several times a week. Nice first impression. Jimmy's is in the John."}
{"text":"Food was great! Its to bad the girl taken my order wasn't. She was annoyed when asked the price difference between a meal and just getting A sandwich. God forbid she had to use her brain to do some math."}
{"text":"10/27/16 Stupid us! We were on a tight schedule tonight and needed a quick dinner. Against my better judgement, the family decided Jimmy Johns. Well, my biggest fear came true. The moron answering the phone assured me of a time that fit our schedule. An HOUR later there is no sign of them. I call, and the same moron said \"there were issues on the road, and your driver just left\". First, your customer service skills are completely missing! Second, you want to make your problems my problems??!! Not at this house! How bad does this location have to get. Wrote something changes??!!    An hour Jimmy Johns??!! Really??!! What happened to \"Freaky Fast\"??  There have been several times that we have needed a quick meal on the go. Several times now, it's taken well in excess of 30-45 minutes. Even Domino's guarantees 30 minutes or less. We have also had two drivers tell us they were the only ones delivering. Now, I could be wrong, but that doesn't sound like your corporate mantra."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before and it was good and so I decided to grab a sandwich here today.  It was just OK.  Nothing special.  I had the Vito.  I would probably try one of the other restaurants around here before I came back here.  There's a Subway across the street and I think it's better."}
{"text":"My husband picked up the sandwiches and brought them home. The bread is VERY GOOD and you can tell the meats are of high quality. I would go back if I was in the area but the only thing is the subs are very small."}
{"text":"I rarely, if ever, have given a 5 star review for a fast food place. Not because I'm a food snob, but typically they never meet up to the quality of food or service you would expect for a 5 star appointment. However, Jimmy John's at the Waterfront exceeded all my expectations on all points.  First, I typically prefer my sandwiches toasted or warmed. This place has changed my mind.  Have ordered here twice to be sure it wasn't a fluke. This location is clean, friendly and super fast. I put an order in for 5 people and everything was made correct as ordered. Let me tell you, that is rare these days. So 3 stars right off the bat!  The sandwiches were delicious and everything was super fresh. Price was on point and very fair. 2 more stars are added.  I am so glad there is finally a healthy, reasonably priced, delicious fast food option available for sandwiches. Jimmy Johns is an absolute all star !"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is freaky fast, but NOT this location!! I wish I could give less than 1 star.  Not only did it take my order 45 minutes to arrive from a location less than a mile from the store during non-peak lunch time, but it was incorrect! When I called to inquire about the delivery the response was \"we can cancel your order if you wish?\" I was also told that the delivery person was \"on the way\", so I decided to wait. About 10 minutes later the food had still not arrived, I called to cancel my order and while I was on the phone the food arrived, I was rudely told that I could cancel but I would have to give the food back.   The sandwich was soggy and incorrect. They even forgot my cookie!   The worst location in Charlotte far and away."}
{"text":"One word \"UNWHICH\"  love me a salad wrap!  I usually get a ham and cheese with extra  peppers!  Yummy!  Always consistent, always fast!  Love me some Jimmy John's!"}
{"text":"Every once in a while I forget how sad the sandwiches are and give it another try. Really, they're pretty bad - cheap unremarkable bread, cheap ingredients, bland flavor -- an overall meh. The only positive aspects are that they have a nice web ordering system which lets you customize your sandwich, and they deliver. But I think the food is of such low quality that I don't expect to ever take advantage of these features again."}
{"text":"We have recently moved to this area and this was my first experience with Jimmy John's. I was so impressed! The bread was fresh and delicious, the meat portions were beyond incredible! As promised, our order arrived \"freaky fast\"! I absolutely will be ordering from them again and highly recommend them to anyone!"}
{"text":"I have typically have had good experiences with Jimmy John's but the uptown location is not a good representation of my past experiences.  I ordered subs this weekend,  it was 1:45, not a peek time, shouldn't have taken too long.....45 minutes later I got my delivery. I realized that the unwich I ordered, that I love so much, was on regular bread (not lettuce wrapped). I called to see if they could remedy the situation, considering I was looking at the receipt, which clearly said unwich, the manager told me that she would send out another one, but I would need to send back the one they messed up......I kindly reminded her that I was about to die of starvation considering it was 2:30 and I had already waited for 45 minutes, she told me that wasn't her problem.   No big deal, the sandwich was mediocre and I will never order from uptown Jimmy John's again, lesson learned."}
{"text":"Subway with a different name.. I'm am very disappointed in the level of service I have rec'd today. Freaky fast delivery?!! How about freaky slow delivery!!  I waited well over an hour to get it and they are five blocks from my office. My company itself brings in half of the business..    And last but not least where's the mustard and mayo packets, isn't that like  a coffee shop without cream or sugar, a hot dog vendor without onions or relish.. ?!!  Shallow, pedantic, unnerving, and quite frankly sub par.  Never returning"}
{"text":"Veggies always seem fresh and bread is hot out of the oven. They are definitely freaky fast and freaky good. Perfect place when you're in a hurry for lunch or if you want to sit down."}
{"text":"Awesome place with awesome food! Loved the homemade bread and super fast service! A bit pricier than Subway, but well worth the price :)"}
{"text":"They have the fastest delivery anywhere. I absolutely love this place. My boyfriend and I order from this location at least once a week. The country club sub is my favorite! Keep up the good work. Grumms and Jimmy Johns are the best sub shops on Coventry."}
{"text":"Poor customer service! New manager decided we are out of their delivery range by a few hundred feet, so now they won't deliver, even though they have been delivering to us for the last 5 months."}
{"text":"We ordered sandwiches for an office party.   The facility would not deliver even though we are less than 3 miles from their building.   We got the order back to the office and they forgot the pickle bucket.  We called and asked for a refund for the bucket (only $6 so we didn't want to drive back and get it).  The request was denied but were promised cookies if we came back and got the pickle bucket.   With so many other office lunch options in this area, we won't use them again.   We love the bread but the service is poor and we'd rather support a business whose owner doesn't shoot elephants for fun (yeah, that was disappointing to discover *after* we had our sandwiches).  We won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! Staff is friendly and service is fast.  I like Italian sub with peppers!  Yum."}
{"text":"This place is good, but the service is bad. One time they delivered my sandwich with no meat, it was a pretty big thing to miss. Sucks because I really like this place, but I'm always scare if I'll get my sandwich or not and if it will even be right."}
{"text":"It's a Jimmy John's just like all Jimmy John's. Clean facilities, Friendly staff, super quick service. I've been eating at Jimmy John's since back in College...When there was only one."}
{"text":"It's a Jimmy John's just like every other one,  fast service,  friendly staff,  and clean facilities.  This one is in an odd location though,  it's in a busy ass mall with a dozen other restaurants,  parking is tight,  forget about whipping in and whipping out.  Also,  damn have their prices gotten high,  $9.18 for a regular size sandwich and a regular size soda,  I'm going to have to find a lower priced local option since I prefer patronizing local businesses.  Three stars... Good food,  difficult location and high prices."}
{"text":"I used to love to eat at this place.... Now they have new rules... They weigh their meat, so you are left with two slices of meat. Not going back. Its a shame because I used to eat there every week."}
{"text":"Bad food and bad service. This is the worst JJ ever... Bread was hard and the meat taste funny. Staff was a joke!"}
{"text":"Service here is below par. Food is always good but the customer service really needs A LOT of work. Seems like they will just hire any Joe Blow off the street. Other than that, it's your typical jimmy johns with good tasting subs"}
{"text":"good workers, good quality food. Kind of bored of their vegetarian selection but i like the fact that their delivery is super fast and their minimum order isn't so dang high like other places."}
{"text":"Overwhelming on your first visit if you don't know what you want to order.  No kid meals.  You can't have anything \"on the side\".  I wasn't overly impressed with any aspect of the experience or food but it was okay."}
{"text":"Wow. Went in and the service was very rude. I was told \"we can't add sprouts to your sandwich.\"  Um?  Ok?  He didn't even look up to tell me. Then another sandwich was made incorrectly. I asked for peppers, oil and vinegar, and oregano. None of that. I asked for a bag for the 3 sandwiches and I was told to go over the counter and get it myself."}
{"text":"Oh My Goodness...I Love me some Jimmy Johns.    I have been to several location and I am never dissapointed.  The bread is yummy.  Deli meat fresh (awesome Turkey).  oh and the pickles...I love the pickles.  Best of all the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I don't understand how you offer delivery and I literally live on the same road, less than two miles away and you don't deliver to my area. Seriously the SAME road?! It doesn't make sense to me."}
{"text":"Took my order, my card number, and never delivered. 30 minutes later i caked this store only to find they cancelled my order because it's out of their area. Horrible experience. Poorly managed, this was a waste of time.   By the way. According to Google maps this store was .9 miles from my location. Headshake."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like making dinner tonight (03/10/13), so we decided to try Jimmy Johns. We ordered online and drove from our home (Luke AFB) to JJ, which took us 15min and our order was ready for pick up. I walked in and the staff was more than helpful. I ordered the Beach Club #12, Country Club #11 and the Slim 4. The sandwiches were on point and the Jalapeno Chips were just right. I would definitely order from there again. It was clean and very inviting. If you want a quick and simple sub, this is your place."}
{"text":"This place is a godsend. I take the bus to work and there isn't really anything walking distance from my office. So when I stupidly rush out the door in the morning without anything to have for lunch this place is pretty much my only option unless I want to spend well over $10 for lunch on a work day, which I don't. And frankly, I could do a lot worse.   I never get anything but a roast beef sub or the Italian Nights sub but both are head and shoulders above similar sandwiches at Subway. Come to think of it, I really should branch out a bit. As far as I can tell, they cut all their meats and cheeses to order and the bread is always pretty much perfect. Oh, and they've never once gotten anything in my order wrong. You wouldn't think that would be that impressive, but I don't eat mayonnaise. And from my experience at other sub shops and fast food places, grasping the mind-bending concept of a sandwich without mayo is an achievement of staggering genius.   And in case you were wondering, they are not kidding in their goofy commercials about how fast their delivery is. I literally clicked confirm order, stepped out for a quick cigarette and when I returned to my desk the reception lady was already calling me to tell me the Jimmy John's guy was here! I know it's not far, but DAMN! And it's always like that, even during rush hour."}
{"text":"What is there to say?  Yes, there are better tasting sub sandwich shops in Tempe - but they don't offer late-night deliveries to us (drunken) college folk until 4 a.m.  During the past two years I've never had a bad JJ's experience. If you're in the delivery zone, wait time is 30 minutes tops.  And they will deliver one sandwich without any extra fees.   This particular shop is located just south of Ball So Hard University, next to Vista del Sol. In-store orders are quick and painless.  I recommend the Vito with hot peppers or Italian Night Club.   Tonight I salute you, Mr. Jimmy John.   Bon appetite."}
{"text":"Aw I was so excited and felt so appreciated that Jimmy Johns was doing dollar subs today for appreciation! We got there at 7:30. Too bad they stopped that deal already for the day because \"they are running low on bread so we have to start selling at regular price.\" You - kidding me? You have to stop early so you can make more money! Never coming here again that's for sure. Shoulda known better anyway since the owner or whoever he is thinks it's cool to kill wild, endangered animals."}
{"text":"I ordered through Jimmy Johns I was not aware of the one mile radius they have for delivery. The delivery guy was very nice but I was upset that they took my order, charged my card and called me back to let me know they can't deliver it's a few miles too far. Now I finally get why they are \"freaky fast\" every company would be if they delivered only within a mile. Corporate needs to change that. I ordered dominoes instead but I wanted a healthier option."}
{"text":"Came into town to visit some friends couple days ago and stopped by this Jimmy John.. We don't have Jimmy Johns in California, therefore, I was inclined to give this place a try. I was amazed at the quality of sandwich and how flavorful the sandwich is. I had the #1, PEPE, the apple-wood smoked ham and this sandwich was excellent. They need to bring Jimmy John's to California.   The staff was also very friendly and the place was very clean. My friend told me that this place just opened too..So you lucky Carnegie-Melon students. Go try this place out!!"}
{"text":"I've come to really admire the sandwiches at this place.    Yes...it's a \"chain\" restaurant.   Yes...it's somewhat similar to its competitor.    Yes...it's not a real \"sit down\" type of place.    It's Jimmy Johns.  You know what it is before either walking in or driving thru.  They serve really good, well portioned sandwiches really, really quickly.    While it's not a traditional deli or mom and pop shop, it's fast, convenient eats served in a friendly manner...all done consistently.    If I'm in the area and don't have time for a lengthy lunch...this is one of my go to spots.  You can go from order to done eating in 15 minutes.  When you're in a hurry (and you're hungry), that's tough to beat and good enough for me."}
{"text":"This location for a 12:30pm lunch hour crowd was very fast - excellent service!  The Turkey Tom #4 wonderful with extra sprouts and lettuce.  Too bad other sandwich places don't offer sprouts.  Wonderful, fresh bun - thank you!"}
{"text":"Clean, simple, easy and very good sandwiches! A nice other choice for sandwich fare. The salt n vinegar chips are tangy and good! The #12 sandwich very tasty - nice to have alfalfa sprouts for sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This location is anything but \"freaky fast\" and they have messed up my order on more than one occasion. Such a disappointment since I love their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great experience at the drive thru! The girl who took my order today was bubbly, friendly, and seemed like she genuinely enjoyed being there. Everything came out super fast as usual completely correct as well! Great staff here keep up the good work guys"}
{"text":"My coworker and I wanted to do something nice for our team and get sandwiches for everyone. We had already called a couple different places for catering trays but it was so last minute everyone denied us except jimmy johns. They made two trays of sandwiches all in 30 minutes and they were delicious. Service was great over the phone and at the store."}
{"text":"Fastest delivery ever! So pleased by it.  It's so difficult with delivery usually to order some food and to get it before you starve to death. Received my food in 10 min! Love it. My sandwich was great, could have used a lil more meat though."}
{"text":"This Jimmy Johns is not only the worse location I've ever been to and ordered from, it is the worst food establishment I've ever had to deal with!  I have ordered from here 5 separate times. I work 1000 feet from the store. Due to my work, I can't leave the building or it sets me back hours for minutes of down time. Besides, they have \"freaky fast delivery\". Out of these 5 times, I've received my order 1 TIME!!!!!  After sitting and waiting for anywhere from 90 minutes to three hours with no order and no phone call, I've had to call. I've gotten the following reasons why my order was not delivered to me.... 1) they ran out of bread and the next closest shop ran out as well.  2) the system went down and they can't make sandwiches without it 3) the delivery driver wrecked their car(as I watch their delivery driver pulling out of the parking lot) 4) the delivery driver wrecked their car (YES THEY HIT ME WITH THIS TWICE SO FAR)  5) they actually called me and said if I wanted my order, I'd need to come pick it up, because the delivery driver was low on gas. (I shit you not people, they said this!)  Today however, after 90 minutes of waiting, me calling, me being told it was in the car on on the way, another 30 minutes after that, I FINALLY get my Totally Tuna sub. As I unwrap my sandwich, my stomach growling in anticipation......what's this!!!  They gave me a sub roll, with cucumber, tomato, mayo, and about 2 pounds of lettuce and sprouts. Not a drop of tuna. I immediately called, and as I was beginning to explain what happened was told to \"shut up\" by the AGM.   I won't go into details about what was said. I ended up having to drive down there after work and get a refund and have a new sandwich made. I have no doubt that this was done on purpose because I had called and complained, after waiting 90 minutes. Nobody accidentally shoves a bag of lettuce in a sub roll instead of the tuna.   I have dealt with only one person who truly seemed apologetic and sincere about the way I've been treated. I will say as well that most of the other businesses I out complex will no longer order, or step foot in that place any longer due to them having the exact same experiences as I have had.   Stay away from this hell hole. Go to the McDonald's or the Raising Caines. The only thing you'll get quickly from this Jimmy Johns is an elevated blood pressure and an empty stomach. I don't know if this is a corporate location or a franchised location. But it blows my mind that anyone would hire such incompetent, rude, lazy employees. The best thing for this location would be for a Subway to take over."}
{"text":"Usually this Jimmy Johns is on point but my order today was somewhat confusing... I ordered a Turkey Tom #4 and asked for it to be cut in half. It got to my place of work at a timely manner but when I went to go eat lunch I noticed that it was just bread and meat. I didn't request just meat and bread."}
{"text":"I have eaten her only a couple of time and today I was not too impressed.  I felt rushed and the sandwich was not too tasty.  It was a little bland.  I added some hot peppers after a few bites to give it some taste."}
{"text":"Both times I placed orders, got there and they were ready, love jimmy john sandwiches!  They usually are fast and prompt when I go for a lunch break. Hasn't failed yet!"}
{"text":"These guys are good. They're always courteous, welcoming, and they go to work freaky fast. I love the location. We needed a good sandwich place in the area. And there's really nothing to complain about. You order a Jimmy John's sandwich... You get a Jimmy John's sandwich. That simple! Their quality product is on line with any other location, so unless they're rude or kick me out with a broom, they deserve 5 stars, and keep the sandwiches coming."}
{"text":"Went to get my wife a sub and this place rocks. They are quick and they are way better then subway."}
{"text":"Over a month now & still have heard nothing back from management at this location. I will not return as they obviously don't value their customers,  not even enough to reply."}
{"text":"I loved Jimmy Johns while in college. Personally i enjoyed it more than subway. The ingredients tasted better and the chip selection was always on point. It was never too crowded at this location probably because it was on the edge of campus.  My favorite sandwich was the California beach club. Turkey cheese, lettuce, tomatoes & avocado. They had some damn good guac there for sure. always a good choice to recharge after a long day of lectures or studying.   I miss this place wish we had one on Long Island. #JJonLI"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is A-Okay. It was my first visit to JJ's. I had an Italian Night Club. It was tasty. I wanted an option for a foot-long but they did not have one. They seemed to be closing early for a Thursday (at 8pm). I would have imagined that like Subway they would be open until 9pm.  I felt it was a little pricy for a 6in sandwich. Perhaps because of Subways recently hyped $5-footlong special. Recall JJ's does bill itself as a \"Gourment Sandwich\"  The staff was friendly and patient while i made my sandwich decision.  The store was clean and tidy."}
{"text":"I guess I don't get the hype. It was OK but nothing special. Served me good in a pinch when I was in the area and needed a fast lunch between meetings. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Was craving a Jimmy John's tuna so I tried to order delivery. Unfortunately the location near me doesn't deliver to me but no biggie, it's only about 5 mins away. got there, placed my order, and my sandwich was ready before my card transaction had even been completed! Really friendly staff and of course, delicious sub."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 slim Jim #4 sandwiches. Brought them to my kids & they had lettuce, tomato & mayo in them. $10 in the trash."}
{"text":"First time at this location & really disappointed. No other customers when we went in, so being busy not an excuse. Only one table was clean & there was an employee sitting at it eating. On the floor next to her, half a sandwich. I even took a picture & sent it to them. No response. If the place is thus dirty where the customers are, what does it look like where they prepare our food. Disgusted."}
{"text":"This franchise has the best customer service of any Jimmy John's I've been to. The employees always greet me when I come in and thank me when I leave, they're fast, and they always get my orders right. The only complaint I have is that they're a little bit stingy on the meat. My fiance got a #5 and there was literally only 1 piece of meat folded in half on the sandwich. He's since started ordering the #3 or #15 instead and hasn't had any problems."}
{"text":"I experienced some of the worst customer service here that I've ever had in the restaurant industry. The staff consisted of snotty teenage girls who were extremely rude to my mother when she simply asked them to pack the tomatoes for her sandwich separately and they didn't understand. Meanwhile, the manager just stood there and stared into space as my exasperated mother attempted to communicate what she wanted to no avail. We finally just gave up and went to the Ray and 54th St franchise. As we were walking out the door, the girls started laughing and pointing at us. I will NEVER go there again."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time tonight. Bunch of kids behind the counter. The cashier called out sandwich numbers out then walked away. My husband asked for a bag and she told us \"bags are self serve\". They are behind the counter! Another \"tween\" even said \"we get so busy at lunch, customers just get their own bags\". We were the only ones in the store. So we had to get our own bags because the cashier walked away.   Food- VERY BLAND. The bread tasted like French bread you get at the grocery store. I had the California. My bread was covered in so much mayo. This is supposed to be a healthy sandwich. Thats all I tasted. Will be sticking with Jersey Mike's, at least they have great subs and their very nice and courteous of their customers.    Staff-VERY UN-COURTEOUS. \"Get your own bag\". Really?????? We even called the Manager and she just said \"Sorry, I know who that was and I'll talk to her\". Wow!   We saw a commercial for them and didn't realize they were here in the Valley. When we saw a store, we were excited to eat there. Will never eat there again. The service was terrible and the food even worse. We'll be sticking with Jersey Mike's! Jersey Mike's........I wouldn't worry about this place......NO COMPETITION!"}
{"text":"I still cannot eat a sub after getting Staph Food Poisoning here last year. It is 10 times worse than regular food poisoning. Please, please make sure they are wearing gloves and the food is at proper temperature. It is still very fresh for me because it was so bad. I think the Health Inspector needs to come in. I wish I world have gone to the hospital to document but I'm tough when it comes to pain. Looking back, I wish I would have gone. Seems like all they hire are kids who don't care about cleanliness."}
{"text":"It's nice for the \"Assistant Manager\" to apologize but seems most if the stores are like this. All very young kids who could care less about you as the customer. We went to one in Phoenix tonight (first time) and will never return. We were treated horribly by the \"tween\" staff, and when we called the \"assistant mgr\", she didn't care either. Subs were plain and tasteless. Will be sticking with Jersey Mike's. Very sad how you are treated at Jimmy Johns. At least at Jersey Mike's, your treated with respect."}
{"text":"Before they raised their prices I used to think it was a good value on a sandwich now I would rather spend the extra $1 and get Jersey mikes. It's a much better sub"}
{"text":"went in just for one sandwich, the girl at the counter must have been training because she couldn't access the register without her co worker who came from the back, she was friendly while waiting. however the coworker looked down right annoyed he was working on a Saturday night/training someone, not pleasant or welcoming at all. on our way out to our car we notice him slumped leaning on the counter on his phone doing absolutely nothing and then hopped on he counter and continued to talk and laugh with his coworkers, wouldn't be so bad if you weren't just acting so rude to paying customers ?"}
{"text":"First I understand that when it's busy have to go over and make do with what you can.  However, that should not excuse messing up an order. After confirming that the order was incorrect I handed the sandwich back to the Jimmy John's and inform them we ate what was missing. Instead of resolving the issue, they handed the sandwich back to me and a packet of mayonnaise to resolve the issue. The only way I'm going back there is if Subway and Jersey Mike's are closed."}
{"text":"Yeah the food smelled great but the servers were sick and when I asked them why didnt they go home they told me they werent allowed or they would be fired and not allowed to have a job 3 miles within the stores radius!!!!. So eww my food is being made by people who are ill. Who knows whats in there. Plus there was something hard in my chicken sandwich. Oh and I found out that this guy spends our money and goes out and hunts endangered animals and takes pictures with them!! That churned my stomach even worse that having someone sick making my food. Sorry Jimmy this girls not eating there anymore."}
{"text":"We ate inside where they have an upstairs unit and I do have to say; their signs and posters are just really interesting and funny. It is loaded with fund and or nice sayings/quotes.  Coming to the real deal (the sandwiches), we ordered a roll with Turkey topped of with veggies, and avocado. I wish they could grill their sandwiches and create more like a Subway concept in ordering as their ingredients and sandwiches are great. However, no worries you can always check out the freebies menu and select your substitutions and add on's.  The people work hard here and get that sandwich going pretty fast! I'm satisfied!"}
{"text":"Unwich! Unwich! Unwich! I try to avoid bread, even though Jimmy can bake a mean loaf. The same yumminess that every sandwich contains, but wrapped in lettuce instead of carbs. And have them add \"all the freebies\".  My only complaints are first, their unsweet tea has no flavor. Not just at this location, but each location. Second, I love the music, but it does prevent having an easy conversation with your lunch guest. Otherwise, service is great, kind of a hyped up version of what you get at Chick Fil A. Rock on Jimmy!"}
{"text":"One day while being hungry uptown and looking for a cheap option to eat, I walked by Jimmy John's and saw their menu.  Their prices seemed reasonable, so I went in and ordered a Turkery Tom 8 inch sandwich for about $5.  The meat was fresh sliced deli meat and it was good quality.  They made it almost as fast as I ordered it.  It's a bit like a pizza delivery chain store though - there is no seating, so I took the sandwich over to the outdoor area of 2 Wachovia - I mean Wells Fargo - plaza and enjoyed it.  I probably won't order from here often due to the lack of seating and I usually go somewhere where I can sit and enjoy my meal uptown.  The sandwich, however, was high quality with more and better meat than Subway despite being on a smaller roll.  If you work uptown, it would be a good place for a grab-n-go lunch."}
{"text":"This place has decent, prompt sandwiches, and I'll take it any day over every other sandwich chain in the Valley."}
{"text":"staff friendly,  overall very clean restaurant, food was fast and great tasting.......Manager  Justin  very upbeat , people person... we will be back !! Thanks"}
{"text":"I must say that this is BY FAR THE WORST Jimmy Johns location. This isn't just one two orders, it's 5+ orders in the last year. EVERY ORDER except for 1 has had problems. \"Delivery so fast you'll freak\" -biggest lie I've ever heard for this location. The orders I place online have ALL taken over 1 hour! I also get calls every time I order saying \"we only have 1 driver, so it''ll be an extra 35 mins.\" I lived in Old Town Scottsdale & ordered Jimmy Johns all the time with fast delivery & zero problems. Whoever owns or runs this location should fired as they lack the basic brainpower to run a small business. I get pizza's faster than Jimmy Johns sandwich! Pizza's taken 10-20 mins to cook & I still receive it fast than this locations delivery. STAY AWAY FROM THIS JIMMY JOHNS LOCATION."}
{"text":"Food's good but the staff is very unprofessional .   First, I ordered online and wanted it ready by 6:00.  I got there  at 5:30 and my order was just sitting there so they probably made it at 4:00, when I ordered  it.  Second,  when I picked it up they said it was paid for, of course it was I ordered  online.  One of the workers then said  the tip was not included and actually asked me if I wanted to leave a tip and started to laugh.  Then several of the workers all looked at me so I took my bag and left.  I felt very uncomfortable  I will never return."}
{"text":"We won't be going back to this place any time soon. The kids working here are extremely rude ! On 6/14/15 @ 12:57pm...( Check #47) We ordered 2 sandwiches.....the girl named Francisco attempted to take our order bt was too busy looking to see who was out front of the restaurant. We asked for our hot peppers on the side of the #9 instead of ON the sandwich....HOLY COW! You'd think I asked them for free sandwiches or something! She said Nope...we can't do that! We put em on the sandwich or nothing at all! I said just put em on the side of the sandwich and wrap it up with the sandwich....she said NOPE...CAN'T DO IT...What else you want? I almost lost it at that point!!!!! We also ordered a #10 which is roast beef and we said with extra roast beef....which they charge $1.50 for. So we get our sandwiches....and of course the roast beef sandwich has a bunch of ham on it! I brought it back up to the \"kids\" at the counter and said this is not what I ordered.....they looked at me like I was crazy or something. They said....\"Yes it is!\" I said NO......I ORDERED #10 WITH EXTRA ROAST BEEF! The girl behind the counter chimes in and says....No....she ordered it with ham! The guy seemed completely confused. Why? I have no idea. Just make me another sandwich the way I ordered it. So the African American guy grabs my sandwich and throws it in the garbage can!!!! What a waste of food!!!! This place freaks out when you ask for hot peppers on the side instead of on a sandwich.....and acts like they cost $20 for 6 pieces of pepper....but yet throws an entire untouched sandwich in the garbage?!!!!! What a bunch of #**%@%! So anyway....I get my CORRECT sandwich......but we couldn't eat it fast enough to get out of there!!! They have the rock music up so loud....it feels like your in a bar!!! Extremely annoying!!!!! And I love music....but this is just too damn much! The older people behind us was complaining about the same thing. This place has just gone down hill bigtime! The employees are rude and act so entitled....and clearly they don't pay attention when you order. Fancisco (girl) that took our order was too busy lookin out the front window....which is why she didn't get our order correct the first time. So another one to cross off the list! It's too bad....because this place used to be good when it first opened....but now they are a penny pinching greedy obnoxiously loud place with inexperienced kids attempting to run it!!!! Horrible horrible service!!!! What's so IRONIC....is on the wall of the restaurant there's a big sign that says THE CUSTOMER IS USUALLY RIGHT!!!! hahaha What a joke! Then they have a sign that reads something about being an asshole! That one is located near the restrooms. Not a sign that should be in a restaurant of any kind!  So clearly whoever owns this shop has no idea what is really happening here!!!!"}
{"text":"I would give them a 5 star, however, they state they deliver but in Parma it's only to Thornton ave. Considering it shows up as delivery - it's partly false."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and the fastest delivery service I have EVER had--I am talking 15-20 min from the time it's ordered or less.  I don't even know how they do that."}
{"text":"Of course jimmy johns is fast food so it's not going to be like some fancy sub, but still I was so disappointed. I love subs and I'm a huge fan of subway, Jersey Mike's, cheba hut, and firehouse. I just wanted to add one more delicious sub place to my list. But I don't think I'll be going back. The bread crust or top was super crisp and hard.  The cookie was delicious though."}
{"text":"Love how fast delivery is....I had the roast beef and provolone on wheat.  It was very good.  I will order again from here."}
{"text":"Are you ready for this? All you see on their commercials is \"Freaky Fast Delivery\". I just tried to place a delivery order. According to the website, I live 2.7 miles away. This is the closest store to my location. I was told that I'm out of their delivery area! I complained to corporate headquarters and this was their response:  \"Thank you for your feedback concerning the delivery area of the Jimmy John's in Stow.  Unfortunately, the address listed below is out of the delivery area.  Jimmy John's was built around fast delivery.   If the store near you won't deliver to you, you are out of our designated delivery area.  This is not a personal thing, it's a strategic decision.  We have a very disciplined strategy with delivery and have found this to be successful in the past.  Going out of our area makes those in the area get delayed.\"   Evidetly their \"disciplined strategy\" is to deliver across the street only. I guess that's how they achieve \"Freaky Fast Delivery. Go to Subway. It's in the same plaza and their food is better."}
{"text":"Well the food Is pretty good.  Aside from that our experience was terrible.  There is a young man I believe my the name of Michael. (Based by the name on the receipt).  This young man was not very helpful while ordering and seemed annoyed when I had a question about the menu.  My wife and I decided to dine in but were subjected to the arrogant attitude of the young man.  I had to return the sandwiches to have them cut and again the young man seemed annoyed and threw the knife in the sink.  Aside from this we could not help but over hear the foul language being used by the staff.  Let's not forget to add that as I'm typing this review from my car the same young man could be seen \"jacking off\" a loaf of bread."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with the service I received this evening. I ordered my food at 10:45 and did not receive it until 12:10. When the delivery person arrived they didn't apologize for the long wait, instead he stood at my front door and confronted me about not giving him enough of a tip...I gave him an 18% tip for food that took well over an hour to receive. I understand wanting to be tipped but I am a young woman and do not at all appreciate being confronted by a man past midnight. Very unprofessional and inappropriate and a little frightening honestly."}
{"text":"I always battle between Jimmy Johns and Jersey Mikes when it comes to fast casual style Subs. This location downtown is a gem lol Super clean, fast service, and plenty of seating inside and out. I went with the JJ's Gargantuan today and it was perfectly made. I added alfalfa sprouts and Banana Peppers for some extra greens a crunch, for the price you really can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are just average.  The staff is snarky.  The manager seems to encourage his staff to be snarky.    Don't order online, it won't save time.  I ordered online and 25 minutes later when I arrived at the store, they still hadn't even STARTED the sandwiches.  Also, there was staff confusion about who was going to make them.  So it took another 5 minutes for anyone to START the order, even though they only had 2 customers eating in the store at the time.    The music was overly loud and no one could hear anyone talking over the cash register at the counter.    Even though I COULD have requested a full refund based on the 25 minute delay despite ordering online, I merely requested free extra turkey on one of the sandwiches, but the manager seemed to relish the opportunity to decline the fair request.  Since it was night time, as I left I noticed the reflection in the front window of the manager and his snarky female staffer smiling broadly at each other as I left (in apparent glee over the joy of declining my small request to counterbalance the long wait).    I went home and sent an email to their company online at their website, and I am posting this experience here on YELP.  I think in retrospect, they may realize it would have been better to give me $1.50 of extra turkey.  And $1.50 worth of turkey only costs the customer that much, not the company anyway.  A BETTER restaurant would have OFFERED to give me a FULL REFUND for the lateness of the order."}
{"text":"I love this Jimmy Johns, they are the definition of Freaky Fast..... There is nothing else to be said....."}
{"text":"I remember the first time I heard about this place I was at South Park mall and they were giving out free samples and that is when my life changed forever. I go here pretty often now after work. Having a sandwich from this place was amazing! The first time I actually went to the store was a really cool experience they're different than most sandwich shops, the staff is extremely friendly, there decorations are cool and they really don't lie it's freaky fast! This is definitely my favorite sandwich shop no doubt!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, good selection and variety, super fast service. I eat here once a week at least."}
{"text":"This place needs to figure out their customer service. They also need to tell their delivery drivers NOT to park on BOTH sides of the road on Montford-it's ridiculously hard for cars to get through."}
{"text":"We ended up here because the Mr Good Cents near us had closed down. What a waste. The customer service was poor, they all acted like they were doing us a favor by serving us. My sister and I ordered a #12 which stated it came w sprouts & avocado. They only carry provolone cheese, no other variety. No real choice of bread either. When we sat down to eat we noticed there were no sprouts & a very small smudge of avocado on one part of the sandwich. When we asked about it the guy behind the counter looked annoyingly at us and said they no longer carried sports and that was how much avocado was supposed to be on the sandwich. No napkins, lids or straws came w our order or were any where to be found so I had to wait again to ask some one for them. The girl behind the counter, again rude, stated they were right there behind the counter (out of my vision) and told me to grab them myself.   The sandwich was bland and boring don't waste your money here, grab a sandwich from the grocery store."}
{"text":"Decent food. Had one experience where they were not \"FREAKY FAST\" took them 45 minutes to get to my work when they are 2 blocks away."}
{"text":"Great and friendly staff! Customer service is great and greeted every customer when they walked in! Repeated the order back and made sure i approves before submitting! When they gave me my order they were very friendly! Always nice going to a place and feeling welcomed! Thanks for the great customer service and friendly smiles!"}
{"text":"Very fast, good food, low price point.  If there's one thing I'm not a fan of its probably the limited bread choices."}
{"text":"Slowest jimmy johns i have ever encountered they are 2 blocks from me and sometime take up to a hour to deliver to me"}
{"text":"55 minutes.  FIFTY FIVE MINUTES.   That's how long it took to get one sandwich delivered.   I called at 46 minutes to inquire how much longer, I work less than a mile from their store. It shouldn't take long to get here. He said the driver has already left with my sub but offered no apology for me having to wait so long.   If I'm getting food delivered it's because I don't have time to pick it up. If I don't have time to leave my office, I probably don't have time to wait ALMOST AN HOUR to get my food.   The arrogant kid just tossed it on my desk with an attitude. You're lucky I already included my tip.  And, once again the bag is filled with pickle juice and my food was darn near falling out of the bag.  WHYYYYYYY IS THIS SO HARD FOR YOU??    Here's the main reason I'll NEVER eat at Jimmy John's again.... http://www.bilerico.com/2012/05/more_than_one_reason_not_to_eat_at_jimmy_johns.php"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!!  The manager DUSTIN was very rude and hung the phone up on me.  What jimmy johns doesn't deliver a mile from their location anyway?"}
{"text":"Horrible attitude from all the workers behind the counter.  Lack of any respect or just plain not being nice! I will never go back here for the fact that the people working there should not be there if they can't smile and say thank you.  Also stared at me in a disgusting way that made me feel so uncomfortable.  To bad cause I like Jimmy Johns food but I will not go back to the people that work at this location. The manager and owner really should be more present so they can see for themselves the sad people they have representing them."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good... but when I went to their nutrition facts I was appalled by how much sodium is in one of these! Maybe indulge here once a year but other than that, the sodium will kill ya."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are great at decent prices... Good food and everything; it's the atmosphere that needs some work. I walked in and first noticed the extremely loud heavy metal music blasting. Then I noticed all the employees were teenagers...  They screwed up our order and gave us 3 sandwiches when we ordered 4. One of us went hungry because the employees didn't take the time to realize that we ordered a fourth sandwich. Yikes."}
{"text":"The parking lot is the reason for the low rating. It is a very tiny strip mall complete with numerous other restaurants including Omelet House.  Best of luck finding a spot to park. More luck to getting out of the parking lot.  Service is quick. Can't really screw up a JJ sub."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I ordered the Gargantuan from JJ's.  Let me tell you, it was fantastic.  First of all, they have a delivery requirement of one sandwich.  That's it!  It's much more reasonable than many of the pizza places, that require you to spend $10 (or sometimes $20!) to be elegible for delivery.  I work out of a business right around ASU, and yesterday there was a man who was handing out samples.  I was so impressed with what I found, I figured that I should go ahead and order one.  It was a great choice.  First of all, they are fast... As they call it, \"Freaky Fast\".  They were here within 15 minutes of my order.  Talk about timely service!  Second, they made my sandwich perfectly.  The Gargantuan has tons of meat, lettuce, tomato, and special dressing to make it taste incredible.    The reason that this review gets 5 stars is because of the delivery man.  When he delivered my sandwich, I paid with a $20, and he did not have change.  He told me that he would return and give me the change.  I was a little reluctant to give him a $20, but I went ahead and did so.  10 minutes later, he was back, asking for me.  He handed me back my change, without missing a single cent.    Very good sandwich, fantastic service, and great prices."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches great prices and open late. Highly recommend for anyone in the area. Great spot here on mill ave"}
{"text":"Amazing experience! To start, I originally had an issue with my order but one of General Mangers, Kiel, took the time to fix the issue. One of the best customer service experiences I have had. With a company as large as jimmy johns I didn't expect that kind of service! Very refreshing! Also my sandwich and chips were delicious. Highly suggest the turkey tom with hot peppers, cucumbers, and onions! I love all the additional options you can get on your sandwich! They shouldn't be over looked, they can add so much! Don't forget the chips either, I suggest salt and vinegar! Yum!! Thanks again jimmy johns!!"}
{"text":"My first time having Jimmy John's. I ordered the LuLu sub. One word, delicious! Friendly staff! Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"I don't know why but it smells very sour in the place. It's pretty bad. I noticed it last time too....   other than that,  sandwiches are good."}
{"text":"This chain claims a reputation for being \"freaky fast\"--and the good locations are, with teams in some locations that can have your sandwich ready by the time you pay. This one is not one of those.  This location is Super Slow, and poorly staffed and not that crowded when I got here. And the kitchen staff was rude ... one girl went and turned up the music for no reason. Then went even louder--we couldn't hear the orders called out once they were finally ready. I asked them to turn it down, but was told by another rude staff member, \"it is supposed to be loud.\"  Not a place to come with friends unless you have lots of time and no desire to pass that time by talking"}
{"text":"If you get a BLT make sure you request that they cook the bacon....otherwise you will get ice cold refrigerated bacon on your BLT.  Disgusting.  I've never been so grossed out by a BLT in my life."}
{"text":"ok food  Absolutely worst drivers ever"}
{"text":"We love Jimmy John's. But they might want to rethink their \"serious delivery\" slogan. We live 1.4 miles away and they wouldn't deliver because we are on the wrong side of town... You'd think a delivery area would be an equal radius around their location, not just to one side."}
{"text":"I've seen faster Jimmy Johns before, but they are still quite fast. As with most JJ's, they are certainly all friendly and the delivery workers are always prompt and nice. Make sure to switch things up and get the 7 grain bread for a tasy and healthy alternative from the french bread. All else, this is a quality establishment; great drunk food!"}
{"text":"Super slow! Never got my sandwich delivered.  Waited for  almost 2hrs.  When I finally called to check on my order they point blank lied to me about having attempted delivery and no one was there.  It was to be delivered at another place of business which has employees working all day.  Unbelievable!! I guess it's Milios sandwiches from now on!"}
{"text":"First time visitor. Cashier was excellent. Whoever made food great job. Delicious. My only problem was the kid who handed me my food what's a Smart Alec. I told him it was to go his response was there's a bag do you want to go get a bag! Rude much!"}
{"text":"I personally think the subs are just so so. My mum likes them however.  So this is the second time I have popped in during the last hour of business to get her a sandwich,  while visiting her in Sun City.  Both times the workers seem not the friendliest,  however being a flight attendant for almost 10 years... I get the end of a long shift blues. Drained from a busy day. So I don't let it bug me.  I am sure my mum will have me stop in again."}
{"text":"Best sandwich ever.....  not even close... ingredients are above average, bread (fresh, good) but really average, they seem to rush and did get my order wrong I wanted no onions, they took care of the problem right away A+ for that. Cleanliness and overall service was excellent......Great concept, but quality over quantity....slow down a little bit.... I agree if I want extra mustard, I don't expect   mustard packets.... for a sandwich shop 3 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"Just stopped by there. Not one worker greeted us. They all seemed rude. Bread was clearly old.  Ice machine was nasty. Not clean at all. Tables clearly not cleaned in a while. One of the delivery drivers even walked by me and my kid and said. Damn that guys an a $$hole.  Who would do that.  Long story short. Rude employees and very unsanitary."}
{"text":"Finally lost it.. Cannot come back here, ive even talked with the managers a couple of times now (Also very unfriendly..) and just cannot be a patron of this place anymore. for one, a veggie sub should not cost 6 bux.. plus for the extra dollar you pay you'd think you would at least be able to get a decent amount of avocado. I cant even describe how little avocado there is on this sub, for 7.34 + a tip this is the biggest BS of a veggie sandwich. Stupid me for thinking it was possible that the past 5 orders were just the fault of a college kid, turns out its standard practice to charge extra for extra avocado and never actually give it out. Just super frustrating to spend 8 bucks for a lousy sandwich."}
{"text":"Consistently below average service here. Sandwiches are ok if you like cold deli meat, but employees act like they have better things to do than serve the customer well. We have been here many times, and if my boys didn't like it, I would not be back."}
{"text":"I loved Jimmy John's until eating a sandwich from this location. I thought the sand which was perfectly fine and tasty until I noticed it. The bottom 2cm or so of my turkey meat was completely clear and slimy. I immediately threw the rest of the sandwich out, my appetite completely lost."}
{"text":"First timer and I ordered the V I T O. It was better then I thought. I added bacon but forgot to add mayo. That was the only thing missing."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I've never wrote bad reviews, but I had to say something after speaking with the manager Miguel.   My 5 yr old was sick, so instead of driving over- like we do every week, we had delivery for the first time. One of the sandwiches was supposed to be an Un-Which (lettuce wrapped) because I follow a ketogenic lifestyle. but, once the sandwich arrived, it was in a french bread roll and tasted SOOOOO STRONGLY of onions which I requested none. My husband said his was SUPER HEAVY onions which he did not request, as well.   I called and literally VERY GENTLY let them know what happened and they put me on hold and said lemme put a manager on. Miguel got on the phone and said immediately is the sandwich still there. Of course it is. I told him yes, one single bite taken. It was inedible with the strong onion.   He asked THREE times if I was sure the sandwich was still here! Like I was lying! At that point, I didn't even want a sandwich delivered due to his customer service. And he said to me, I've been here 7 years and haven't spit in a customers sandwich once.  Like what???? Nah, thanks I'm good. We go there weekly, and will NEVER be back.  Attached picture is after me picking the onion flavored meat out to eat."}
{"text":"Gotta love Jimmy Johns! They always have quick service and the sub bread is delicious. I always get the  #6 veggie sub, and I've never been disappointed and still keep going back for more. Be sure to request the sprouts for extra goodness on that sub! Oh! And their triple chocolate chunk cookies are outta this world awesome too!"}
{"text":"Ok, ok, you got me Mr John. Seems like when lunch time comes around, you just happen to have a location that is conveniently nearby. I have been to this location several times before you guys decided to close down to remodel and boy that seemed like forever. Now that you guys are open, I see that you made the place even better. I think out of all the other locations I have been to, this is definitely the biggest one.  As for the sandwiches, you cant really go wrong with any of them. Except maybe the veggie sandwich. Come on man! What kind of sandwich is that if you don't have any meat up in there? To me that sandwich does not exist except for when I mention that it doesn't exist in this review.  I basically have 4 sandwiches I order as a normal rotation. They are #8 Billy Club, #14 Bootlegger Club, #16 Club Lulu, and if I am really hungry, The JJ Gargantuan (it's so much meat that giving it a number was not gonna be enough).  Sure I can go on and on about what is in these sandwiches but I don't want to waste your time. Just stick to this rule of thumb: If you like ham, roast beef, turkey, and bacon, then any one of those that I mentioned will definitely satisfy you especially the JJ Gargantuan. This monster has salami, ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey and provolone topped off with onion, lettuce, tomato, and Italian dressing.  Pro tip: If you refer to their menu, there are freebies that you can have them put in your sandwich like onions, lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, sliced cucumber, hot peppers, dijon mustard, yellow mustard, oil, vinegar, and oregano. If your sandwich does not normally have these items, they will not put it in your sandwich unless you specifically tell them to. Same thing for freebies that are already in your sandwich. You can order extra of that item. Also don't be afraid to ask for different bread. They give you the standard white bread with all your sandwiches but you can ask for wheat or the traditional sliced bread.  Service will always be lightning quick because of a couple of factors. All the sandwiches they make are cold so there is no time wasted in cooking or heating anything up. Secondly, they have an assembly line type of set up so you have different people taking turns putting stuff in your sandwich.  The only thing that takes that one star away is that because they don't have any hot sandwiches like meatball or a cheesesteak. I love my usual sandwiches but sometimes I gotta have something hot and fresh off the grill. Until they make that happen, it will always be 4 stars from me.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #66"}
{"text":"Like my tip said, \"IM FREAKING OUT MAN!\"  They make subs so fast you'll freak! That is one of their mottos. Yes it does hold true.  I ordered the #10 Hunter's Club because I love roast beef and this sandwich has the most they pack from all of their choices. Everything was good from when you order all the way up to when you receive your food. They have an assembly line style of system, that's why they can make your food fast.   For you first timers, here's the breakdown. All their sandwiches are 8 inches long. Now from the sandwich choices you have numbers 1 through 6 which is just your basic sandwiches with everything in it. (refer to their website for descriptions of each sandwich. Didnt wanna do it here because I know you dont wanna waste your time reading this). Numbers 7 through 17 are sandwiches that have twice the meat and/or twice the cheese. You also have slim sandwiches which are any sandwich choice minus the veggies and sauce. For you carb conscious folks they have the JJ Unwich. Everything is the same except it's wrapped in lettuce instead of it being inside the bread. And finally, you have their ultimate sandwich called the JJ Gargantuan. Get this only if you are really hungry.  So once you decide what category you want, the choices get much easier since you wil decide based on how really hungry you are.  I gave these guys 4 stars because of the really fast service and pretty good sandwiches. The only reason its not 5 stars because any time I want a sandwich, I think of something hot, like cheesesteak or meatball or turkey with melted cheese. So JIMMY, if you are reading this, I NEED A HOT SANDWICH!   So for their complete menu, (and maybe some of you agree with me on a hot sandwich so be my guest if you wanna chime in as well) www.jimmyjohns.com"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Jimmy John's location. As a UNLV student I usually frequent this location on my way to work and pick up my sub to go. The lunch crew is always on their A game, energized and friendly. You're acknowledged the second you open the door and they're ready and waiting for your order which will be prepared in less than a minute usually. They recognize their regulars as well. I hadn't been in for a few months over summer and I recently came in and they still remembered my order. Great customer service! And of course the food is delicious. My favorites are #16 with Dijon and you can't go wrong with the #9. Sandwiches are always fresh, delicious, simple and tasty.   Now if you're going at night it's a COMPLETELY different story (hence the 1 star deduction). I used to come here at night before my night classes but I have stopped doing that. First of all, it's always been pretty empty when I've gone at night so you'd think there would be awesome customer service...wrong. The few times I went at night you have to wait a few minutes to even be acknowledged while the staff continues their conversation (whether it's with their fellow coworkers or their friends who are there eating). Eventually they take your order and make your sandwich at a glacial pace. The entire time you're there you feel like you're inconveniencing them and interrupting their evening.   Needless to say I've found a different place to eat before my night classes now. But if you're around in the day you absolutely need to come by!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food, the music was blaring there tonight. It was like going to a heavy metal concert. I was happy to leave.

{"text":"My friends would get these great looking sandwiches from Jimmy John's   and they would rave about them and so one day I decided to try it since they were close to my new office. I ordered same sandwich as one of my co-workers had gotten where we used to work, and it was like night and day. I basically paid $7+ for bread. It was like one thin piece of meat, one piece of cheese and everything swimming in mayo. It was so bad that I decided to write and no one responded to me. So I decided to write a second time about it (very nice but honest letter) and again no response. Can't believe how a popular business cannot even reply to an unhappy customer."}
{"text":"Great food. Great price. Great service. My wife and I love Jimmy Johns - and this location has never let us down. The staff are friendly and (freaky) fast. I highly recommend this location. The parking lot is a bit busy, but not too bad."}
{"text":"As far as the food, it's a Jimmy johns. Always decent, always consistent, and before I started ordering from this location, always fast.  I can reliably depend on this location, which is barely a mile away, taking between 45-60 minutes to deliver my order. I've started just going to pick it up because the delivery folks always have some crazy story about why it took so long. (Last time, the person couldn't find the location before me and REEKED of cigarettes handing me my food.) I'd understand if this happened once, but it's literally EVERY time I order and \"give their delivery folks another shot\".  It kind of breaks my heart because I used to LOVE Jimmy John's in TN... They were always to my apartment in 15minutes and were roughly the same distance away. THOSE were subs so fast I freaked... These are subs so slow, you might as well give up."}
{"text":"First off, the two young guys working there Sunday 7/12/2015 were amazing! Give them a raise! Seriously, so sweet and welcoming. Made sure we knew not to worry about any mess our kids made. They were willing to add Mayo to my kids' slims since they're teeny and well, kids. These fellas were amazing...hence why we came back 3 days later..  Unfortunately today, 7/15/2015, the two young girls working were borderline ridiculous. By the time we left, one of them finally acknowledged our presence and said, \"Have a good night\". Our night began with both of them staring at me while my kids and I were at a table waiting for my husband to get back from the bathroom. They literally stared at me the entire time like I wasn't going to order or something. Okay, fine, they just wanted to get a jump on my order and make sure they didn't miss me?  We ordered one Country Club, One Italian Night Club, 2 Turkey Slims and three bags of chips. Every time in the past two years that we have ordered Jimmy John's (Including at the same location three days ago!), the employees are willing to add Mayo to the slims. We have no problem paying for that. Tonight, the girls became agitated and absolutely refused to put mayo on the damn sandwiches. There are probably 80 giant jars of mayo on the shelf. Then, they said that there was no vinaigrette for the Italian....but that was that.. Nothing could be put in its place because by golly, that is not what the recipe for the damn sandwich was. We were eventually told that they could give us Mayo packets and we could put them on the slims....with no knife...but there was just no way they could put Mayo on them... unreasonable request on our part. Another guy came in and got the same response except he asked for more Mayo on his sandwich and one of the girls thought about it for a while and said \"I can give you some Mayo packets\". Another fella waited about 10/15 minutes for a sandwich....he was the only person in there other than us and we already had our sad subs. The girls didn't even want to greet anyone. A mom and her daughter came in, ordered the Italian, and were told that they wouldn't be charged for something else on the sandwich but God forbid we ask for some damn Mayo. This was insane. We could hear them bitching about people asking for the freaking Mayo.   When we got our sandwiches, my husband's sandwich (Country Club) didn't even have the ham on it...which is half the sandwich. Mine, the Italian had a little bit of meat and the rest was lettuce.  The entire time they seemed irritated by my baby who was babbling some baby talk. No one cried, no one left their seats. I hate bitching about this stuff but seriously..for a customer satisfaction related company..this was insane. We have a very close family friend who is a Jimmy John's franchisee... He has one currently up and running and is opening three more.   Seriously. There are 80 jars of Mayo. You're fine. No vinaigrette? There were like 20 jars of vinegar. Ridiculous. Anyways, after two years, we will never return to this location. We come to the splashpad at least 3-4 times a week and frequent Jimmy John's. We will drive to a different one and drive our happy butts back. Sorry to inconvenience you Mayo Police."}
{"text":"I love jimmy johns this location is pretty bad. This whole process was awkward and uncomfortable. Usually you walk in and your greeted with hellos and smiles not here. The girl at the register didn't say anything to me besides my total. She did not make eye contact and did not ask for an order I just told her. Four people were on the line to make sandwiches and they were sooo slow. I was the only person in line took five min to make two subs, partly because they made the two wrong subs the first time (maybe if the girl at the register spoke this may not of happen). At least pretend to like your job people.   Update I've come back to this location and it had improved. I take away the 1 star and move it to 4. Jimmy johns itself amazing and it's to close to pass up sometimes. Lakewood parking sucks not JJ's fault."}
{"text":"If I could give fewer stars, I would. It has been over an hour and a half since I ordered my food and the driver has yet to show up. I live less than .5 miles from their location and they can't even deliver close to moderately fast, let alone freaky fast. This location is just terrible. This isn't the first time this has happened. They are consistently bad at what they do. Their only saving grace was refunding me my entire order and still delivering my food. Oh wait, still no food. So it's as if I never ordered in the first place. Which is what I suggest you do."}
{"text":"I had the Tuna sandwich & jalapeño chips. The sandwich was very bland. It had no flavor at all. The jalapeño chips had flavor but it did not taste good either. Very disappointed with the food. Subway taste much better."}
{"text":"Arrived at 7:30 pm on \"Customer Appreciation Day\" only to wait at the counter for about five minutes while I watched about 12 people running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  I made eye contact with several of them several times but they just continued running around without acknowledging me.    Then finally someone came up to me to let me know that they ran out of the $1 subs but they could sell them to me at full price.  They also referred me to another location that was still honoring the promotion.  \"Honoring\" is right!  I just walked out.  I read the website and it didn't say anything about \"while supplies last\".  It just said from 4-8 pm at participating locations.  After this, I'll never be back again!  Thanks for showing \"Customer Appreciation\"!"}
{"text":"Fast delicious sandwhiches with kettle chips and laid back atmosphere. French bread is great. Can't eat at Subway with Jimmy Johns around."}
{"text":"Im really disappointed in Jimmy Johns service. Their sandwiches are delicious but the night I called (Jan 11) the person answering the phone totally botched my order.  I called to place a delivery order and when I gave the address he read it back wrong to me so I made sure to give him the correct address. He read back the correct address and I figured everything was ok. At the end of the order I asked if they had jalapeños and he said \"we have red peppers\" So I asked for 2 sides. He then said \" I can put them on the sandwich for you\" and I said perfect just put them on the sandwich and if I don't like them I can peel them off.  At the end I asked him what the approx delivery time was and he said 15 minutes. This place is about a mile away from where I was staying so I didn't think it would be a problem.  after about 45 minutes of waiting I called and was told the driver was about 5 minutes away because he had other deliveries before me. 15 minutes later the driver calls and asks me for my address because he couldn't find my location. 10 minutes after that the driver finally shows up and delivers our food. The driver was very apologetic and he showed me on the receipt that the person on the phone typed up the wrong address and sent him somewhere on the other side of town. It clearly wasn't his fault.  an hour and 10 minutes to deliver 2 sandwiches is unacceptable! To make things even worse, there were no red peppers on my sandwich!!!   Long story short, great sandwiches but bad service. Its not that difficult, get it together! What a joke...."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are always great, prices are worth it and delivery is crazy fast (I've never been in the store - Delivery only). That's that."}
{"text":"I was delighted to find out that Jimmy Johns was in delivery distance to my job. After reading the reviews I was a little scared to order from this location. Twice! I have ordered twice in the past few days and both times I received exceptional customer service (the guy even laughed with me on the phone ..), delivery was FAST and friendly and Quality of food was perfect!  No complaints here! I would recommend this location to anyone :)"}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service everytime I come in to eat. All of the subs are the freshest quality."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience of ever had a Jimmy John's I went through the drive-through and got an unwhich the lettuce was oldit was wrapped in properly I know it's hard to wrap the sandwich in lettuce but the one in Scottsdale's that's a perfect every time the sandwich was disgusting and it fell apart right when I opened it it was such a bad experience I immediately logged on to yelp   The tomatoes were tiny and two of them were the end pieces  The lettuce was old and super wet (0crunch) Not much avocado spread all the taste my Unwhich usually has did not exist on this sandwich everything was so old I felt I had been robbed   And I usually love to treat my self to an Unwhich  Clearly this isn't a good location and wasn't the quality I've come to expect from being spoiled from the one in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"It's new to the neighborhood and my wife (who has never been to a JJ's) and I decided to give them a try.  Clean with a bright decor and friendly staff made for a good start.  Music was more than a bit loud but I did have a whimsical moment.  Our Choir Directof from Church was there with his family and I asked him if"}
{"text":"26JUL16 - Would have been 4 had the delivery kid brought change... for a cash order.... it says \"Cash\" on the receipt.... I called the manager to ask why he would send a driver on a cash delivery with no change. He talked in circles until I got a BS answer and he wouldn't take responsibility for it.  I am pretty sure the delivery boy was scheming for a larger tip. 1 star for your tasty sandwiches.  27JUL16 - Fast delivery, good food, forgot napkins. Not driver's fault, chock this one up to petty management... again... Delivery driver was cute though!   10AUG16 - JJ sent me a $10 gift card. I'll be trying out a different location."}
{"text":"There is no jimmy johns in California and it's a shame  I love this place  Funny that subway is always busy and this place is not when they have 3000000 times better sandwich's  The team is nice and friendly  When I asked why they have such a bad reviews they said it's bc of the delivery so I guess jimmy johns need to do something about that  I care about what I eat when I'm there and I just love it"}
{"text":"First time ever going here. And it will be my last worst service and worst subs ever. Jersey mikes is so much better maybe because I'm from jersey and used to great subs. I know I will never go back there again. Waste of my money"}
{"text":"My jaw hurts from chewing on this bread and I paid almost $9 for a sandwich with no drink or chips. Save your money and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Ordered a sandwich at 2:30pm it's now 3:25 pm and still don't have a sandwich. Sadly this is common for this jimmy johns.  Freaky fast is just a slogan not a realistic expectation. This happens every time I order from here. Going forward I'll spend the 2 dollars more to order from Zella's."}
{"text":"I freaking LOVE jimmy johns!!!  When I used to live out in Ohio, this was our late night pit stop for food!  Having moved back home to Cali, I had been Jimmy John's deprived.  That is, until I went to Vegas for my bday and my cousin told me that there was a Jimmy John's!!!  Needless to say, I would've eaten all my meals here if I could have but I had to accommodate the other people in my party, so we only went twice... but took a bunch of sandwiches to go! :)    I love their bread, and it definitely makes the sandwich!  Not to mention their freakishly fast service and awesome sandwich ideas!  It's seriously good, and I am drooling thinking about it!    If you are near a Jimmy John's, don't take it for granted!! :)"}
{"text":"Usually do the drive through. Fast, decent food. Wheat bread is great. Did I mention fast?"}
{"text":"Jimmy johns has always been close to my heart because they are awesome and freaky fast!! I've been to this location before and have always had fast, friendly service. It's always busy, especially with the lunch crowd during the week. A line 10+ deep will only take about 5 minutes tops to go through the line, order and be on your way. Keep in mind this is a on-the-go location so don't expect to sit down. They do not have tables.   I've also ordered from this location when I worked 5 minutes outside of uptown and the delivery men were awesome. They ride their bikes like speed Demons through uptown and I swear they would beat any car delivery any day.   The turkey Tom and beach club are always winners in my book and I love their kettle cooked chips. Yum!"}
{"text":"Service was fast and yummy! Got The Veggie- #6 with everything on it. The bread is always good and veggies seem to be relatively fresh. There is also plenty of parking and an outside patio for when it's nice out."}
{"text":"Just wanted to thank Kelsey and his crew.  I stopped in the other day and mistakeS were made on a single sandwich order.  Today, as we were ordering, he clarified acouple things. He also guaranteed great service from his crew. They were all polite and friendly. Our sandwiches were perfectly delicious!  I wasn't overcharged. When I'm in this week sometime, I hope that crew can do as well as Kelsey's crew. We'll see, and I'll let you know...     Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Yes this is a chain but a good one.  No. 12 has a soft spot for me and the French bread is tops.  As for this location I did order delivery and they were fast, positive and polite.  They ran out of sprouts so added chips in lieu at no cost.  Thanks JJ"}
{"text":"As someone who lived in an Illinois college town, Jimmy John's was always a front-running food option, known for its fabulous \"food so fast you'll freak,\" and super cheap slim subs.  I'd pick up a slim on my way to the Amtrak Illini train on any journey back home, and probably also eat Jimmy John's back in my hometown as well.  We were tight. I went through a phase with the turkey tom (\"#4,\" highly recommended - it has sprouts!), and then the roast beef (\"#2,\" ask for easy mayo), but never really had a favorite.  They're both so good and so different, so I'd go with the mood of the time.  But no matter what - delivery or pickup, eat in or carry out, lunch time or late night, Illinois' Jimmy Johns never did me wrong. We had a brief reunion in Denver a couple years ago, but because the only JJ in California is in Clovis (what?!), another reunion was a longtime coming. That's where this JJ's comes in.  We came here the day after Thanksgiving, after a wonderful time hiking around Red Rock Canyon.  We were famished and thirsty and Jimmy John's met all of our needs.  But here's where it got interesting (or at least my pathetic wannabe foodie idea of interesting!): I decided I wanted the tuna sandwich (\"Totally Tuna,\" \"#3\"), and instantly developed a new favorite.  JJ's menu will declare \"My tuna rocks!,\" and they tell no lies.  (True story: it was also so fast I freaked!)  It was a wonderfully flavorful tuna salad, and topping it with tomato, cucumber, and sprouts was an awesome flavor combo.  I love tuna sandwiches, and this was by far the best I'd had yet!  And I haven't even started taking about the bread yet!  It's so good you'll just have to try it - and you might find yourself buying some of their super cheap day-old bread! So - overall, my reunion with Jimmy John's was everything I imagined and more.  We relived our old times and left with an even stronger relationship than we had before.  Even after all these years, we still make wonderful new memories together."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would! They won't even deliver 7 minutes away from their location! This company really needs to change things for the better. Turning down an order for 15 sandwiches, drinks, and chips, over 7 minutes is ridiculous. I'll take my business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I went in this evening with my kids. We ordered our items, and I ordered my wife's. My wife wanted the #12 unwhich style. Which basically means a sandwich wrapped in lettuce. My order was up, I gathered my sandwiches and drove home. Once home, I handed all things out. To my surprise, the messed up my order. They wrapped a #9 in lettuce and not the #12. I called and tried to fix the issue. I was told that they could make what was messed up. However, because I was less than a mile out of their deliver zone I had to pick it up. As a chef, customer service is key. Therefore, going the extra mile or in this case less, is necessary. Long story short, I had to go back and pick it up. This company is all about customer service yet they won't fix the issue and take care of the customers the way they should!"}
{"text":"HOLY HELL! NOW THIS IS WHAT I CALL A MOTHERF***ING SAMMICH!  I had been hearing from my best bud, that there's this place in Tucson called Jimmy John's that has awesome sammiches.  We'll lo and behold they opened one here in Tempe and by the way my friend kept describing the subs I decided to finally go and get one for lunch. I got a Turkey Tom and wow, that freaking sammich was awesome! The subs are long and soft, and they're full of yumminess. The bread is tasty and it tastes like bread. Turkey tasted like Meat. It was like there was a party in mouth and everyone came! I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's, so it saddened me to give this location a low rating due to the service and my incorrect order. This is the closest location to my house. And after a few visits after my negative review, I can solidly say they have redeemed themselves. The employees taking my order have been much more friendly and personable. They have gotten my customized sandwich orders correct as well. #12 no cheese, no tomato, add sprouts, onions and extra cucumbers. And as always, my food is prepared super fast! Thank you for the improvements made!"}
{"text":"The employees here are very fast at making the sandwiches, often times they are ready before you can even sit down. They also use generous amounts of meats and toppings. It is not uncommon for a sub from this location to weigh almost twice as much as one from a Jimmy John's down the street, meaning more food for the same price, and a better tasting sub. The employees are very friendly when you walk in and they usually have more then enough employees scheduled to work so that things run efficiently. My ONLY complaint about this location is the reduced hours. They close at 7pm on weekdays and 5pm on weekends, but almost the entire surrounding area is downtown businesses, most of which are closed by then, so I doubt they would get much sales after those hours if they stayed open later. That being said, if you can make it there before they close, its worth the trip to this location, even if it's not the closest to you."}
{"text":"My experience with the Stretsboro Jimmy Johns has been nothing but positive. They have a large staff of employees who are always busy and I've never had to wait more than 15 seconds to be waited on even during busy hours. Everyone is friendly and polite and helpful to \"newbie\" Customers like I was. Their sandwiches are  very good but could use a little more pizazz. Maybe I'm just used to Subway. (We have THREE Subways in Streetsboro!) The sauce is mostly mayo and the veggies are kind of blah. But I can tell they try very hard to please. I don't understand why you have to bag your own food though."}
{"text":"POOR SERVICE! We Called at 2140 for delivery to the emergency department (For ED Doctors and Nurses working night shift) we were told the delivery person had already left and they would not add or delivery any sandiwches to the hospital because \" we close soon\". Store didnt close until 2200. We can not leave the hospital to get our food- Wont be ordering anything from the lazy jimmy johns again!"}
{"text":"The food here is as good as any other Jimmy John's location but the delivery is really inconsistent. Some of the drivers are great, others not so much. I always order around the same time for delivery to my work so I can eat lunch which is always at 12pm. Sometimes the drivers are early and it's like they expect me to leave my desk and suffer conflict with my supervisor over a sandwich. Sometimes they're late and I spend half my break waiting for them to arrive and am left wolfing my food down before I have to clock back in. The last order was so late I didn't get to eat it at all and had to put it in the fridge for after work. Some drivers read and follow directions others ignore them and then act put out when they arrive at a locked door and have to walk or drive around the building to the correct door. I used to order Jimmy John's several times a week from a different store at my old job and never had any of these problems with delivery which leads me to the conclusion that this store has some kind of management issues."}
{"text":"Sandwich sucked!!  First order ever at JJ and let me tell you I ordered the #12 club which is Turkey cheese and avocado spread with mayo I said no to lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers but I added bacon.  First when I order a club sandwich I don't expect to get a sub, I did, second when I order bacon I expect it to be cooked, It wasn't, I also expected avocado spread what I got was a blob on the right side of my sub, not club sandwich, and that's it.  The bread was stale and hard, the mayo was barley on any part of the sandwich.  So yes I will take Port a subs over this place any day.  Jimmy Johns sucks!  Let me tell you why, we called the store to explain and the manger there could of cared less.  When I heard him trying to explain why I just hung up on him, he had no interests in fixing the problem he just had excuses.  Glad I don't run my business that way.  I would have no customers.  So to the un-helpful, un-apologetic manger screw you and Jimmy Johns....your place sucks!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches everytime! I love the bread. Of course they are fast, which is nice. I even like their own brand chips. If you haven't been, give it a shot asap!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here it's on point. Cashier is always nice, sandwich makers are always moving fast and not a single mistake in all the times I've been here. It's rare that they are ever behind unless some big catering order gets in their way. Even then it's a really short wait and they're super apologetic. Sandwiches are always good and not messy like Captiottis. Zero complaints here."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! From the rude girl taking my order, which was wrong, to the food quality. Delivery was fast, but wasn't carrying anything edible. Never again."}
{"text":"Dang you, Jimmy John's! You're conveniently located, fairly priced, and so tasty. Every time I order, I get extra hot peppers. Jimmy John's is nothing without those hot peppers. You gotta try the beach club, man. So good. Don't forget the hot peppers."}
{"text":"Extremely rude. I had problems ordering online today and called them to let them know and the guy on the phone could only say \"well I don't know what to tell you\" and I had to ask for him to just place a order over then phone!  then hours later I called back to let them know that even though online said my order didn't go through, I STILL got charged four times!!!!! And the same guy picked and was extremely rude, not handing me over to the manager or even trying, he just told me to go to my bank. I order from this location multiply times and I will not anymore. SO SO disappointed. I'll go to my bank tomorrow and see if they can do anything but definitely calling the store back tomorrow and customer service."}
{"text":"My favorite large chain sandwich shop! By the time I ordered and paid they handed me my sandwich. My wifes face when I got back into the car after about 90 seconds was priceless. They never have long lines and never cut corners on their products and quality. The atmosphere is pretty great too with lots of funny signs to read. Definitely try to go there often."}
{"text":"They would get a 0 but yelp requires at least a 1.   Untrained employees, they advertise 5 mile delivery but won't deliver 2.8 miles away.    Lots of other much better places around, no need for the aggravation."}
{"text":"For the record, I don't eat at JJ's so please know this isn't about the service or meal experience. However, it is VERY DISAPPOINTING that the JJ's delivery man was in such a hurry that he found it necessary to jaywalk across 6 lanes of traffic on Central, then zig-zag through waiting traffic on Earll on his skateboard. In addition to being an extremely unsafe practice by the young man for both him AND traffic, it shows a blatant disregard for other pedestrians and for traffic laws. I remember back in the day, Domino's Pizza drivers were under so much pressure to deliver in under 30 minutes that they put their safety at risk. I hope this kid isn't working under those conditions & was just feeling immortal like kids that age do. I tried to report this on the JJ's website, but after entering the information, I got an error message (how convenient)."}
{"text":"I love this location because it has a drive-Thru! Order online and when I get there it is ready. Have not had any problems with customer service or food quality. I have picked up in the drive-thru twice and was out of there in minutes. Perfect place to grab a quick lunch without having to park. Yay drive-thru!"}
{"text":"This is usually my default if I need lunch fast in between meetings. I order online and like 10 minutes later it is delivered! Bread is always fresh and delicious and the online system is really easy to use to place your delivery order. For a sandwich, its pretty good and the fact they deliver makes it even better."}
{"text":"Haven't had a problem with jimmy johns until today ordered online just like previous times and took a time of 8 mins to get here since it is only across the parking lot. So today they decided to take 25 mins to deliver my order and the worst part was its only a ham and cheese sandwich and a large coke.... Come on guys! 25 mins... I am a big fan of jimmys and their pride in the way they serve their food and delivery but today was just an off day hopefully this doesn't happen to you."}
{"text":"8 people behind the counter. I order 2 sandwiches. No one in front of me, one woman ordering on the other register.   Even though I paid before her,  they make her half dozen sandwiches before me. Whatever.  10 minutes pass. I still don't have my sandwiches. 3 people who showed up at the restaurant aftet I ordered already have their food.  I ask where my sandwiches are. They haven't started working on it. Then, to add insult to injury, they work on another sandwich after they've acknowledged that they forgot about my order.  Never again. You hire incompetent workers that inconvenience your customers because you want to save a few dollars and you lose my business. This isn't a chain that people go to because it's good. The whole appeal is that its fast."}
{"text":"I just ate the best made turkey unwich I've ever thought was possible. Jimmy johns has the best bread, and service for sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery over an hour ago, and am still waiting for it to be delivered. \"Freaky Fast\" must not be their motto anymore. When I called to inquire why it was taking so long, they just said it's \"busy today it will only be another 5-10 minutes\". That was 30 minutes ago. I'm extremely disappointed in the fact that they took forever, offered no apology, and wasn't even accurate on their estimate for delivery. I won't be ordering again. This is just pathetic customer service and a poor experience. Do NOT recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Could be just an off night but walked in at 7:45 on a Monday night (note my experience was an in store one) and the one employee in the place was on the phone sitting down. She didn't even acknowledge that I had walked in, and continued to talk for about 5 more minutes without a word to me (even as I walked around, grabbed chips, tried to make eye contact etc). The bicycle guy finally came in a few minutes later and rang me up, then I still had to wait for the employee to get off the phone before my sandwich was made. She claims she was speaking to her regional manager, but even if that happens to be true, I can't imagine a regional manager not understanding the need to serve a customer. Hugely disappointed by that service and don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"This preggo lady thanks you! By far my family's new fav (and close by) sandwich shop. We came in earlier with my youngest son (it had probably been a year since we had tried JJs) and all of the staff were so friendly and leaning over the counter to say hi to him and wave. The place is immaculate in terms of cleanliness, staff was cheerful and happy to be there. Just a great experience.... so great I had my husband pick me up another sandwich later that day because... pregnant lady cravings LOL.   We will definitely be back, and will also tell others to check them out."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me, this place is great.  Perfectly sized bread, quality ingredients, cool staff.  When I think dream sub, I think italian night club no mayo, and extra peppers.  Don't get no betta!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sammich spot!!! The bread is fresh and great!!! I always get the turkey tom with extra mayo (make sure you get extra mayo or you will have a dry sub on your hands). The hub loves the gargantuan. The only other advise I would give is to not get the chocolate chip cookies (they are pretty dense and not very good) and read the signs while you sit and eat. They are pretty funny. The service really is fast and I have freaked a few times. Be sure to take advantage of the free smell as well"}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed in a Jimmy Johns. I eat here often since I work in the plaza but today it was horrible. I ordered the BLT (the first time I have ordered this) and it was disgusting. The bread was hard on the ends. There was a load of mayonnaise. 4 soggy tomatoes and 4 pieces of cold hard bacon. Also IT HAD A HAIR.  I will NOT be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I wish they had hot subs,but other than that,heaven sent,super fast delivery.except the mill location on weekends,duh.big sandwiches w bacon,stay gold yelp"}
{"text":"The only reason jimmy johns is fast is because they only deliver within a 2 mile radius. I live exactly 2.3 miles away.  WHAT A JOKE!!!!!! Subs are good tho."}
{"text":"My wife and I thought the food was terrible. I'm not even sure how to describe what terrible means, but I would put subway and 7-11 pre-made subs ahead of Jimmy John's s. Will never come back!"}
{"text":"Like the food but what is it about this location and the music. Always way too loud. The staff is friendly but don't go here expecting to be able to chat with the people you are having lunch with. Some days it's like being at a Nine Inch Nails concert."}
{"text":"SLOW DELIVERY / HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE / & NASTY FOOD! I wouldn't order from here again if it was free! The person answering the phones is very rude. The delivery person was late, is dirty and has HORRIBLE body odor! This whole place is TRASH and the employees are TRASH"}
{"text":"That was a really fast sandwich. I enjoyed the decorations, and the customer service was about standard. Food was unimpressive for the price, but it wasn't bad. Take the time to read the walls...they're fun."}
{"text":"Two times now they have had slow delivery to my place when I am only right around the corner from them. The first time the driver was stopped by Scottsdale PD, so understandable. This time I have been waiting over an hour and a half and still no driver. A call to the store at the hour mark and I was told that today's driver was riding a motorcyle (in this rain) and he dropped his bike in a puddle so they have been using a driver from another store. This is beyond absurd and I am about to call and ask for a refund. Edit: Just had to drive to the store to pick up my order. The manager really needs to train the employees better."}
{"text":"Who is in charge at this place? Of the 6-7 employees inside, there was not one person that even pretended to know what they were doing, nor move around with any intent or purpose. They moved in slow motion, and looked thoroughly confused.  I waited in line behind 4 cars in the drive-thru. It took over 30 minutes to get through, not freakishly fast. Then as I was a few blocks away and bit into my sandwich, I realized it was the wrong one! I drove back, parked and went in. I told the man at the register that I received the wrong sandwich and he acknowledged what I said, then finished helping the customer who was getting change back (rightly so). She leaves, and he proceeds to fiddle with his cash drawer and completely ignore me. Needless to say, I got his attention and had the correct one made. 5 minutes later, the customer who was behind me in the drive thru came walking in with my sandwich, needing a replacement! -3 stars for service, 4 stars for the sandwich. It tasted very good, but definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week, I always choose the place because of how quick they deliver. Most of the time I order the same meal, request the same items such as mayo packets/napkins....majority of the time they forgot the mayo packets which sucks considering most of the time I get the sand which they hardly put any mayo on it. Other then that, everything else is always good!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. First time they forgot to add the sprouts I requested and this time they forgot to put turkey on my beach club. How does that even happen. Also for any iced tea lovers avoid at all costs. Jimmy Johns has the worst tea I think of any chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the service at Jimmy John's on Baseline a new store I went in and ordered a sandwich and Ordered a pickle as well. I was told by one of the cashiers that they were not allowed to put it in a bag because we didn't call to order. So here I was carrying the sandwich and pickle with no bag out to my car. Isn't the customer always right shouldn't they have provided a bag anyway?  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Gave JJ a try since they were having a customer appreciation day.  That had subs for $1.  Got the \"john\" which was roast beef.  Sandwich was made fast!  Just finished paying and it was ready.  Kind of through me off a little as I thought I was going to watch them make it.  For the $1 price and speed of making the sandwich it's a 5 star.    I gave them an overall 2 stars because the meat on the sandwich was lacking quantity.  It was mainly bread, lettuce and tomato with a little meat.  I would have been mad if I paid more than a buck for it.  I will stick to Sprouts for my sandwiches."}
{"text":"I was in Champaign a few weeks ago to see my little sister graduate from my Alma Mater... After getting caught in the downpour after the Friday night graduation ceremony, I stayed in and I ordered Jimmy Johns. My first thought after ordering for delivery was... when did it get so expensive?? I feel like when I first started school, sandwiches were around $6 after delivery fees (only 25 cents then). Granted, this was in 2010. But paying $9ish before tip is a little steep.  I was stuck between my two favorites-- The Vito and the Beach Club--- but I went with the  Vito. When I finally got it, it was DROWNED in vinaigrette. If I wasn't so tired & cold, and if the streets weren't extremely congested, I might have gone back to get a new sandwich. But next time I will just walk to the nearest one to skip the delivery fees."}
{"text":"We are a step or two above subway here!  The bread is much better, and there is more of the meat in their sandwichs.  I had the \"vito\", italian meat sub, with lettuce, onion, mater, dressing and mayo.  Deli meats taste fresh and the bread is hours old.    The service is very quick, but that is the advertising plan, isn't it!  The drive-in seems slower than walk-in.  But don't you want to know if your sandwich bounced off the floor?!  Get out of the car and watch them work."}
{"text":"ok we're comparing Sub sandwiches here.   they're portion controlled, presliced, and only fresh bread makes them stand apart.   well they are really good at the bread part here!  the Lakewood location is much better than stronsville one.  they actually give you enough dressing to taste on the sandwich! !  I got the vito, basic Italian sun.   very good tasting, and fresh veggies.  worth the stop"}
{"text":"We placed a order for delivery in the downtown area and the food arrived incredibly fast. Tasted fresh and our office couldn't be more pleased. Very glad to see Jimmy Johns in the downtown area!"}
{"text":"I like Jimmy John's. It's usually a pretty darned good sandwich. My favorite is the Italian Night Club.  So, while they are freakishly fast and the food is good,  I personally think it's a smidge overpriced for what it is, and it's considerably noisy (even when there are no patrons). Sounds like the employees are having fun at least! Temp. control is also on the cold side too, but not too big a deal.  Also, I like the bathroom signs! Will post one..."}
{"text":"I don't eat at Jimmy John's often enough to know if the food received here is a standard or an exception. With that said: \"hey Jimmy John's, you think you could spare a few ingredients? Don't be so stingy\". I'm extremely disappointed in both the QUALITY as well as quantity. Absolutely terrible. Stale, rock-hard bread, and pennants for meat. Why do you pull out the center of the bread (the best part), and throw it in the trash? Who makes a sandwich with only meat and lettuce? Are things like onion, pickles and other options not a consideration? Maybe they are, but who knows?  To the reader of this review: If you are considering the Jimmy John's at this intersection, don't.  Do yourself a favor and go to the shwarma house in the same parking lot.  A tad more in cost, but at least you get what you pay for... Quality food that fills you up, and tastes great.    Overall very disappointed with this place, will not go back."}
{"text":"This is the nearest location to my job and I love it! I'm usually in a rush during my lunch time and by the time that I am done paying they have already made my sandwich! And their new spicy ranch is delicious!! Cheap, delicious and fast!!"}
{"text":"After a friend raving about this place for 6 months I had to go.  I'd say my turkey sanwich was pretty average. I'd never go again simply for the fact they don't have Sweetener for their unsweetened iced tea.  Boo."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns, but this particular location, I had gotten a couple subs last Sunday for us and we both got food poisoning from it. Whoever works Sunday afternoon (3 of them) doesn't understand or care about hygiene. Every JJ is pretty quick and efficient in putting their sandwiches together, and I had thought it was odd how 2 large subs were done an wrapped in 1 minute. The usual demeanor I've come to expect from JJ emploees at every location was not present at this one and came across more like bored friends hanging out and smirky which should have set off another alarm in my head but I chalked it up to typical teen angst. They remind me of 90s Subway workers who never wash their hands or sanitize the prep areas including the water underneath the ingredient bins.  Please fix the quality control at this location."}
{"text":"So I went there today I was not for sure if this was the Grand Opening or what.   1. The Cashier was NOT FRIENDLY! And the Manager is OK. I just expected more due to the fact that this was their first day open. I had to tell the cashier to smile BUT SHE STILL SAID OR DID NOTHING! I don't even think was said anything to me or asked any questions, the manager basically took my order while the cashier stand there.    2. Another thing they did that I HATE.... TELL MY TO SWIPE MY CARD WITHOUT TELLING ME MY TOTAL!! If you tell some to swipe their card tell them the total, customer should NEVER have to look for their total from the cashier registers!! NO EXCUSES!!  3. The only people that was friendly was the employees that was making the Subs. Cashier are the first person customer sees when walking in they need be more friendly! And managers too. As a manager your employees feed off you.   4. My Sub was good. But this was my first time ever going to Jimmy John's, so helping 1st Time customer should be a MUST especially if you want them to come back."}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches, with pretty fast service and delivery.  It's easy to order online and have it show up quickly, or pick up.  There are lots of sandwich options and they accommodate special requests readily."}
{"text":"Fast, reliable, always get exactly the same tasty, high quality sandwich.  What else is there to say?"}
{"text":"Not a great location.  I've only been here twice, but both times the sandwiches were sloppily assembled.  This most recent visit, they put the avocado spread basically on top so it was getting all over my hands.  While I think Jimmy John's is normally a good solid four stars, this location doesn't put enough care into the build."}
{"text":"Fast, reliable, always get exactly the same tasty, high quality sandwich.  What else is there to say?  This location was busy when I went in, but I still had my sandwiches in less than two minutes."}
{"text":"You guys didn't participate in the dollar sandwich days, which I really didn't have a problem with. It clearly states that some shops will not carry that promo. So I proceeded to order the sandwich at full price and asked for a cup of water, she was very hesitant to give me the water cup and asked me to pay $.50 for regular Jimmy cup to put water in when I declined she pulled out this tiny little water funnel that couldn't even stand straight up and down and would have to be laid on its side which obviously wouldn't work with fluid in it. This place is pathetic don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Julie  This place is pretty bad.  I don't have much else to say.  I'm sitting here for lunch because I'm in town at a clients and somehow wandered in here thinking I would get a quiznos or subway like experience.   Not even close and I don't even like quiznos or subways.    Choices are scarce. I went with a ham an provolone.  Everything seems to be lathered with mayo.  I asked for mustard and some sweet peppers.  No peppers.  Nothing but lettuce and tomato.  But I do see alfalfa sprouts and cucumber on the menu in some of the other sandwiches.    The bread which is suppose to be freshly baked taste chewy and like it's been sitting there a few days.     6 employees stand around doing nothing while the kitchen looks a bit dirty.  And damn, as I sit here listening to the employees laughing at each other, I realize there is 5 jars of peppers on the shelf.   WTF....   Whoever owns this place really needs to clean house."}
{"text":"We got  two subs from the  jimmy john in Goodyear  at 138th Ave  the subs were very dry like a stale roll call and call the manager  we the only  way they would  help  us was if we brought back  it back she would  maybe  be able to  help us since  my wife went to  get them and bring  them  home  for  our dinner  it would  be  real hard to do since we live about  22 miles  round  trip  will  not go to that  location  again  stale  subs and management  is not people  friendly."}
{"text":"good club sandwich! wheat bread + good-quality beef + generous serving of veggie + good services + short waiting time = inexpensive + convenient + tasty + healthy"}
{"text":"Their slogan is 100% true. They are freaky fast! I like using their drive thru for lunch because I can be back to work and enjoy my lunch without losing time waiting. I can usually order and receive my sandwich in less than 2 minutes.  The only negative comment I can make was my fault, I ate the Italian sub and dripped the juices on my new polo shirt and ruined it. I wish that sandwich wasn't so damn good, I could have saved myself $65 at Belk."}
{"text":"Not very good customer service. I added extra meat to a sandwich and watched the sandwich make not put it on there. I asked the cashier about it and he said they did but confirmed to make me happy. They didn't. I clearly was ordering to go and the girl tried to hand me two sandwiches and two bags of chips. I had to ask for a bag."}
{"text":"Delivery half a mile away took 20 minutes and they gave me the wrong sandwich. Also, maybe find a delivery guy that can speak an entire sentence instead of grunting.  Sandwich was good even though it wasn't what I ordered and they got my chips right so they get two stars."}
{"text":"I don't get the fad? The bread is just ok and the fillings are piteful. They don't have very many veggie options to make your sub a little more hearty. The chip flavors are strictly their brand and could use more variety. It's a bit expensive, about $10 for a medium with chips and small drink, compared to it's competitors. I'd rather do firehouse and get a meaty sub then just some bread. I do have to give them props for fast service, clean restaurant and delivery!"}
{"text":"\"Jimmy Johns, Freaky Fast!\", that's because they don't put anything in the sandwich.   I ordered a #12 Beach Club sandwich because it says it comes with Avocado Spread.   I get my sandwich and take a bite and it feels like I'm eating a shredded lettuce sandwich. Hardly and meat in it, can't taste any Avocado Spread, can't even see any Avocado Spread.   After dissecting my sandwich I found a thin green haze I between the two slices of cheese.  Might as well not list the spread as part of the sandwich when there isn't going to be enough of it to taste it, let alone even be able to see it.   Honestly, every part of the sandwich, from the hard on the bottom chewy bread, rabbit feed lettuce, sour tasting cucumbers, and invisible Avocado Spread made this the worst sandwich I've ever had.   This is my third attempt trying a Jimmy Johns sandwich and in my opinion, they all suck.   Updated 5-12-17  Changed review from 1 star to 3 stars  So after months and months of arguing with coworkers about the quality of Jimmy Johns subs I gave it another try and got the Vito. Surprisingly the Vito isn't half bad but needs a good Red Wine Vinegar which most sub shop have.    So I went out and bought some and put it on my Vito a few days later and now I have a Jimmy sub I like.   So far all the subs stink except the Vito when you add red wine vinegar to it. I even tried the Turkey Tom and was disappointed to find that it DOESN't come with Provolone    unless you ask for it and pay an extra $1. It has hardly any meat on it and is heavy on shredded lettuce and mayo.   What keeps me going back to Jimmy Johns now however is I'm addicted to the Chocolate Chunk Cookie. So I get a Vito and doctor it up with my own vinegar and get a cookie and I'm good!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Jimmy John's! When my belly doesn't feel well and/or nothing sounds good, I can always count on a Turkey Tom sandwich because it's very simple yet very delicious. I like this location because it's clean and the staff are friendly. I think it's pretty cool that they have your sandwich ready by the time you're done paying. It really is freaky fast! I also like the potato chip options and the fountain drinks. I'd much rather eat here than eat at Subway. The ingredients are much better quality."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep trying this place? Jimmy Johns has horrible sandwiches, they rush way too fast and they have no flavor. The only good thing about JJ is their chips! Their motto says \"Gourmet Sandwiches?\" Nothing Gourmet about them! The bread is hard, they don't put enough meat and cheese on it, it's all bread!"}
{"text":"Need a whole lot of subs to bring to your client for a lunch meeting? This is your spot. Very reasonable pricing. Handled by phone. Always ready, even if you show up early.   Consistent and very good."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's just delivered me two subs in 14 minutes.  The beach club always hits the spot for me, my husband says the Italian and tuna sandwiches are both good, and their cookies are excellent.  Clearly, there are fancier, higher quality sub shops out there.  But the sandwiches are $5-$8, orders are customizable, the app works great, the ingredients are fresh if not gourmet, and they live up any expectations set by their obnoxious radio commercials."}
{"text":"Fantastic subs, good customer service and prices. And really quick delivery service, Jimmy Johns is my spot."}
{"text":"They have quick reliable delivery. Never had a mistake with my order. The bbq chips are amazing!   Of the sandwiches I've tried they are pretty standard, nothing to special, but when you are too lazy to drive and have no food at home you can count of jimmy johns to bring you some food!"}
{"text":"Went in on 1-1-17 at 12:41. Was the only customer in the place. Ordered a turkey, provolone, extra lettuce and dressing. As I'm paying I see the guy slathering mayo and tomatoes all over a sandwich, and I ask \"is that mine?\" He says \"yes\", and I say \"no mayo, no tomatoes, extra lettuce and dressing\". So the guy (now pissed), remakes it while I get my drink. I leave and get back to work, and guess what? It's turkey, provolone, very little lettuce, NO dressing, and tomatoes (again!). It's not rocket science to listen to your customers!! I called today to speak with \"the manager Brian\", who could not have cared less! I told him the story, he just kept saying \"we don't give refunds\". Who cares about freaky fast when the order is WRONG!!! There's plenty of our great sandwich places near The San Tan / Marketplace area that I will patronize. I've let all the folks I work with at the hospital know the way this Jimmy Johns does business. STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"Was really fast and so yummy! They also did something  really cute. Where it has a space to put your name I put my fiance's nickname  \"Italian stallion\" they wrote out Italian draw a picture of a stallion horse. Made my day! So cute. I'll post a picture of it to."}
{"text":"EVERY time i order from this place it takes them a minimum of 45 minutes to get my food.  This is supposed to be the fastest delivery.  They do not make any attempts to make it right either.  Horrible customer service and slow delivery.  Food is typical jimmy johns except by time i get my food its been in a delivery drivers vehicle for at least 20 minutes while he's making other runs.  Never again."}
{"text":"Sooo, I waited an hour. Received an apology phone call, to give them 5 more minutes....never to receive my delivery. Poor business ethics, will never return."}
{"text":"Just got a sandwich all bread no meat 8 dollars for this.    Pathetic.   For 8 dollars the sandwich should be filled.   Pissed to say the least."}
{"text":"I don't usually do reviews but had to speak up. My company does frequent group orders here online and we've NOT ONCE had our order processed correctly! What's the point of offering to customize your sandwich and offer online ordering when it never works out! You'd think that since it's listed by detail online, that you couldn't mess things up.. wrong."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with a sub from Jimmy John's.  Sandwiches are made fresh to order at the speed of lightening. They use top quality veggies and meats on fresh French bread. The beach club is my absolute favorite and I add cherry peppers and sprouts at no extra charge. The staff at this location has always been friendly and polite to me. The restrooms and dining area are also kept clean! I haven't taken advantage of their delivery service but I will now that I live less than a mile away in days I don't want to leave the house."}
{"text":"This by far has to be the worst Jimmy Johns location. It's ironic, they call themselves \"freaky fast,\" but in reality they are painfully slow!!! I have ordered from them three times now and every time it takes 30-45 minutes. Hell, I could have gone to the store bought the stuff and made ten sandwiches in that time.   Worst yet, they haven't gotten a sandwich right yet. Once i ordered extra meat and they gave me easy meat and charged me. It literally had two pieces of turkey haha. I called them and they told me they wanted the sandwich back and I waited for another 30 min...  Needless to say, I won't depend on them anymore and neither should you!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this location is not well managed. They refuse to stock all items on the menu (like sweet tea as an example) as they are unable to maintain normal levels of traffic at this location. Today I went back again and they were out of bread. Yes a Jimmy Johns out of bread.   Most frustrating of all, the service is just not welcoming.   Other locations nearby offer a full menu and more personable service (Euclid) so I avoid going to this location despite it being closer to my home. By the way, subway is right down the street. Don't like subway as much but head to head in this situation, subway is better."}
{"text":"Always receive high quality service and equally high quality food. My order is always exactly as I order it without issue. The Italian Night Club is super flavorful and perfect size for a dinner meal. Add Jimmy peppers for a little spice. If you like pickles, ger a full pickle cut in half or quarters to enjoy with your sandwich. Deliciously crunchy and fresh.   Would highly recommend this Jimmy Johns to anyone in the area that needs a fast and tasty meal."}
{"text":"Took my dad (from Boston) here today...  He said \"that was one of the best tasting sandwiches I've ever had\""}
{"text":"world slowest service. had to call twice and still have not got my sandwhich. has been over 45 minutes and we are directly across the straight. i will never go here again. this is not the first time this has happened. i order from here atleast 3 times a week. i will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable.  I order my food each time and it comes here usually in 7 minutes.  Perfect each time. 2 days ago me and my wife placed an order and one sandwich was completely wrong as I suspect they gave me someone else's order.  I called and in 6 minutes I had my original order plus a new free sandwich credit.  Amazing service and food"}
{"text":"Worst place ever!!!!They missed up on my order called them n ask to just replace it !!! THOMAS is the manager I spoke with, very rude disrespectful!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Greeted warmly, restroom very clean, fast sevice, ordered #10  meat tender not very flavorful, bread fresh, soft I will return"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, horrible service!"}
{"text":"If I could think of one word to describe Jimmy John's, it would be..overrated...or average. The subs aren't bad, but they're really nothing special. Everyone raved over the beach club, which I could honestly make taste better myself. Tons of mayo, the avocado tastes like its squished out of a tube (not whole fresh avocado). The bread was fresh. Not to say I wouldn't eat it again...it just wouldn't be my first or second choice."}
{"text":"Literally the most annoying sandwich place on the planet. I tried order the J.J Gargantuan without roast beef, and they still charged me for the Same sandwich without substituting any other meat. For another meat it would be an extra 1.50. Ok, fine whatever. I then attemped to get more mustard and they said they can't give a side of mustard without an extra charge. Really, for Mustard? No thanks. Also, you have to ask for napkins, because they don't have them accessible, and they don't give them to you with your 10 dollar sandwich.  I don't know who Jimmy John is, but Jersey Mike is a way cooler person in my opinion.  I won't be returning. The pickles are fantastic though."}
{"text":"Probably order from this place once a month. Really good sandwhiches but I wish their website worked more smoothly. Sometimes I can order online, sometimes their servers are down. Not cool."}
{"text":"I decided to grab a sandwich from here on my lunch break since I didn't have too much time. I ordered the beach club sandwich, which is my go to meal thinking I was in for a tasty treat!   Well, I got a treat alright. Food poisoning. Big time.  I should have known that when the first bite tasted super bitter lettuce. I just took the lettuce off and kept eating.   I've been doubled over for the past 7 hours with the worst food poisoning I've ever had.   Not sure if this is a one off thing for them as I didn't order inside, but I will definitely not be here again or recommend it"}
{"text":"To many times we write only when we have negative experiences but I just had a great WOW! Experience and I wanted to share!   Every Jimmy Johns I have been to is fast with good customer service mostly. But the experience I had here was exceptional! The girl at the counter greeted me like they do at all Jimmy Johns except her tone was energetic and exciting!   The service was \"freaky fast\" and everyone seemed engaged and passionate. I watched the delivery boy literally run to his car to ensure the service was prompt.  I am an expert in costumer service and whomever is in charge here should know that this is the ideal standard that most Jimmy Johns probably strive for and great job engaging your team!"}
{"text":"Ok. The sandwiches are pretty good and they make them very fast. I had the Hunter Club. The bread is really nice but the roast beef is average. I enjoyed it but I think that it's a little expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"This is a standard Jimmy John's location that can be found on the west side of Rainbow Blvd. between Hacienda and Russell.   I really enjoy a good sub! I also enjoy Jimmy John's subs. They are definitely a cut above most of the other chain sub shops (Subway, Port of Subs). I very much enjoy their bread and the prices are fair and reasonable. My favorite is the #2 the Roast Beef sub!  MMMMMMMMMMMMMM. Roooooast Beeeef. *said in the voice of Homer Simpson*  I also like how the meats, and especially the lettuce, always tastes and looks fresh. I hate getting a sub with soggy, wilted looking lettuce!  I guess my only issue with this particular location is the service. While not horrible, it certainly isn't spectacular either. After receiving lackluster service on my first visit I made it a point to not review this place until I had made at least a few visits. It seems to be pretty consistent. Maybe the bar was set high by the crew on the Windmill and Eastern location I used to frequent, but they always seem to be in a bit of a blah mood here.   I'm sure I'll end up by here now and again, but I think maybe it's time to branch out and check out some other sub shops in the area.  As for now, this Jimmy John's is A-OK.  3 stars."}
{"text":"This place has really started to grow on me! I wasn't overly impressed the first time out, but I keep going back because the sandwiches are tasty and the service is speedy and friendly! I feel it would be unfair to keep it 3 stars, so I'm going to give it a bump to 4! I'm quite sure I'll keep going back for many repeat visits!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like them the reviews all seem pretty good, and they were recommended to me. Pretty cool that they came around and brought some samples to my friends place to try they weren't bad just not great. For 15$ I got a turkey and bacon and avocado sandwich with cheese. a med. drink chips and cookie. The bread was stale, there were like two dime sized spots of avocado and overall it was just bland. I could have gone to subway and had two footlong chicken breast subs made same way for this price. ever walk in or by the place you know how good it smells and there is a variety of choices, not to mention a generous amount of ingredients on them. Sorry but i won't waste my hard earned $$$ here any more."}
{"text":"Great Customer Service!  Angel helped me figure out what to get being a first time patron!  They also delivered in the middle of the day which is hard to find in Kent.  Thanks Angel, Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches rocks!  Robert Murdoch"}
{"text":"This is the most amazing Jimmy Johns EVER!! I am currently at work and I decided to order Jimmy Johns. Not realizing that I left my debit card at home, I placed my order online and quickly had to call and cancel it. Fifteen minutes pass and I get a call on my cell phone explaining that they were just going to give me my food for free. It completely made my day and I will forever refer this Jimmy Johns to everybody! Thank you so much. My sandwich was amazing also. :)"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches served by nice employees.  Nice spot for grabbing food for a picnic.  I greatly prefer Jimmy John's over Subway or Firehouse.  The only sandwich store that I see as being just as good is Penn Station but we don't have one of those in Gastonia yet."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is IDEAL for lunch or when you need a quick bite. They offer likable sandwiches at reasonable prices. In comparison to other sandwich shops, Jimmy Johns is not the best nor the worst. Service is fast, convenient and best of all, this store is extremely clean. Customer service is great. This Jimmy Johns location is a great example of how great customer service can earn you an extra star."}
{"text":"I order from here multiple times a week and always put in the special instructions \"EASY ICE IN THE DRINK PLEASE AND THANK YOU\" yet they can never get it right. I mean it's not more expensive to give out more soda than ice but I guess the workers there don't know or don't care or think it's funny to fill the cups up with ice and almost no soda."}
{"text":"Simple, easy menu. 1st time here. Sandwich melts in your mouth, but is lackn a lil flavor."}
{"text":"It's Jimmy Johns after all so what can you complain about they get the food right they do it quickly and they deliver quickly, nothing extraordinary but definitely standardized and consistent"}
{"text":"Super fast delivery!!!! I feel like I ordered a super basic sub (number 1) but it tastes so good with only 5 ingredients ! Way better then I had imagined for a sub. Pretty fresh too ! Will order from here again."}
{"text":"This is the first JJ's I ever went to, and I instantly loved it. Its a chain and its not the same type of sub as Dave's across the street, but its still great.  The bread is actually the secret ingredient of a Jimmy John's sub; something about their french bread is extremely appetizing. The rest of their ingredients are pretty high quality, although not mind-blowing. As the other reviewer indicates, they are pretty simple overall.  Seating is plentiful, the hours are good, and the prices are quite reasonable. When I go back to Cleveland, Jimmy John's is one of the few places that I allocate more than one meal at (have to make the most of my meals!)."}
{"text":"l dropped by my local Jimmy Johns a few minutes before 10, their \"official\" start of business hours in order pick up a couple of sandwiches for me and my sweet lady to be enjoyed later in the day.  When I came into the shop. Dave's greeting and the smell of freshly baked bread was an awesome welcome to my home base Jimmy John's.   I ordered my lady's favorite sandwich, the #2 Big John (Rare roast Beef, mayo, lettuce & tomatoes. I asked for onions as well). My favorite is the #5 Vito (Genoa Salami, Capricola, Provolone Cheese, lettuce, tomatoes & onions and a house vinigarette dressing. I ordered xtra veggies and some mayo.  Dave jumped on my order and within no time (Freaky Fast as it were!), had our sandwiches expertly crafted. Thanks Dave buddy! Also met Doug,  one of his colleagues who was a riot! You guys helped start my day off on the right foot! Thanks for that!   Hook'em!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to pick up a couple of sandwiches for me and my sweet lady for later today.   Alex (see attached pic) welcomed me and took my order. Today, my lady decided she wanted to deviated from her usual favorite, the #2 Big John, Roast Beef and opted instead to try the #3 Totally Tuna with extra tomatoes. I had my usual favorite,  the #5 Vito, w/extra veggies and some mayo.   Alex  & Steven got right to work and in no time (Freaky Fast!) did a great job crafting our sandwiches!   Thanks for the fast and friendly service, you guys rock!  We'll see you all again soon. Hook'em!"}

{"text":"I've always liked Jimmy's and this was the first one I've had after a decade abroad.  The sandwiches are very good.    When I'm hungry, they are a bit small, especially since they don't offer larger sizes.  Also, think they generally use too much mayo.  But in general, I really like it, and have been eating lunch here 3 times a week."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here for delivery (I work across the street) and got it in literally 5 minutes. Great service and it was really fresh too!"}
{"text":"Again great experience, they really know how to greet you at the door and everyone loves the job and working with each other, I don't know what your putting in the water but keep adding it, cause its working! I'm a fan! and will spread the word!"}
{"text":"Two and a half stars!  A couple of my co-workers and I had to attend an off-site training session this morning.  As a way of saying thanks, our District Director treated the three of us to lunch afterwards.  To tell you the truth, because of all the great sandwich shops Downtown, I'd never eaten at Jimmy John's before.  Subway, Quizno's, Jimmy John's--they're all pretty much alike to me.  I did opt for the Turkey Tom and on its own merits, it was a good sandwich.   The turkey was better than what you get at Subway and the veggies (sprouts, lettuce, tomatos, plus I had them put onions on mine) seemed fresh enough.  Just a couple of notes of caution:  these are 8-inch subs and although you might think a turkey sandwich is light, these bad boys still pack in over 500 calories.  And that ain't even with cheese on it.  And if you opt for the \"healthier\" 7-grain wheat bread, you're bumping it up to over 600 calories."}
{"text":"Ordered sandwich trays for work...alot of trays... and there was little to no meat on each & every sandwich and enough shredded lettuce  to choke a horse. I guess its GREAT if you're vegetarian.......very disappointing."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and I was really impressed. Service was amazing and the food came out extremely fast. They made that sandwich in like 2 minutes lol crazy. The bread was slightly different than most sandwich places I've been to, but it was really good. They even sell their bread from the day before for 50 cents. They have their own brand of chips and their jalapeño chips are freaking amazing. So are the red peppers for the sandwiches. This place does deliveries too and have a bunch of employees working. Which is why everything runs so smooth. I love it! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"If I wrote a review for Jimmy John's that could be read in as much time as it takes for them to make your sandwich, you could stop reading now. And if I left it at that, this review would be dumped into the \"not recommended\" section.  Seriously, Jimmy John's brags about super fast delivery. That's not a lie. I've ordered from them and also dined in a few of their other locations. They are consistently fast! This past weekend, I grabbed lunch with my oldest son at the location on Southern near MCC. For the record, this is probably his favorite place to eat.  There is enough variety on the menu to try something different each time. However, my son is a huge creature of habit here. Without asking, I know he's ordering an \"Italian Nightclub\". I've tried it once and it's delicious and stuffed full of meat and fresh veggies. My tuna was also fresh and tasty. It had the perfect amount of lettuce and the bread is always amazing!  Jimmy John's always has creative restaurants with their own personalities. And they are always clean! But don't forget the employees. They may be fast at their job, but they're always friendly too. Thanks JJ!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of what sub shops used to be. They use fresh ingredients, good quality meat and delicious bread. The No. 9 is divine, but so is every other sandwich I've tried. I highly recommend it for tasty subs, fast service and good prices."}
{"text":"Only my 2nd time here, the first time it was ok so I decided to give it another shot. This time I was VERY unhappy. I walk in and asked what their famous sandwich was, the lady was helpful and said a #9. I decided to try it and before I could say no mayo, add mustard and peppers the sandwich was already made... The worker had to go back and open the package to make the adjustments but obviously couldn't take off the mayo. I just said forget it I'll just have it like that, then before I could explain I wanted onions the worker bagged it up again and had to reopen the sandwich for a 2nd time....damn can you wait so I can tell you how I want my sandwich?!?! Then my boyfriend ordered and the same thing...before just making a sandwich wait to see what someone wants on it before just assuming. Not happy at all and the sandwiches had very little meat!! I don't usually comment unless I'm really unhappy with the service."}
{"text":"Just go to Jersey Mikes. The sandwiches here are just missing the flavors that Jersey Mike's has. And its dumb they charge for putting on yellow mustard. No one does that. And you have to ask for them to cut it too. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Small, parking is terrible! They always make subs so fast, great quick eat. I am disappointed in how many vegetarian options they have (one) so it's difficult for me to frequent JJ."}
{"text":"It's not easy for me to give out one star ratings but wow one of the worst experiences I've ever had. I was deeply disappointed by the service and food I recieved at this location. I was the only person in the store but felt like I was getting extremely rushed the whole time. I have a dairy allergy and had to ask three times to not put cheese or mayo on my sub for the cashier to understand. I was very confused about what other toppings and sauces I could get which I had to ask about several times before being shown the list. This was my first time at JJs and if you didn't order something by the number I feel it is pointless. Sub ended up being absolutely awful and I needed up throwing it away."}
{"text":"I live approximately 2 miles from your store. I called to get delivery to my home and was told you don't go past Union Hills. You now made a hormonal starving pregnant woman who is carrying twins, on bedrest and can't fit into her car cry. All I ever wanted was an Italian sub with soup. Even offered to pay an additional 30 bucks in delivery fee... But noooooo heaven forbid you drive 2 miles away. Thanks a lot. Thanks a whole lot..."}
{"text":"We made two visits to this slop shop last night, our first and last. Who ever heard of an 8\" sandwich, especially when it costs more than a foot long at Subway or Quiznos. Their bread was as hard as a rock, and their bacon was like eating shoe leather. But that's not what REALLY turned me off! The guy had already put mayo on the bread, and started putting on tomatos. I told him I didn't want tomatos, so he threw them right back into the bin. (with the mayo on them) And the excess mayo that spilled onto the counter, he scraped up and put back on the bread. No thanks, we will never eat there again!"}
{"text":"Apparently there are blatantly racist delivery bike riders at this establishment. The food is inconsequential. Employees shouldn't be able to talk to customers in that way, especially not when they're on the clock. That's that. Do not buy food from here if you have enough moral structure to be intolerant of racism."}
{"text":"If you weren't looking for this place you'd drive right by and if you are already in the parking lot of the strip mall it is located in you'd never know it was here due to its sort of interior location between buildings.  I really like the bread they use...dare I say better than Cap's bread?  Yep, I said it.  I had the Club Tuna, #15 to be exact, and the quality was really good with all of the vegetables being fresh.  The only thing I'd prefer is that the tuna had a bit more flavor...some simple relish would suffice.  Also the drink offerings were not my style...I don't drink soda.  How about some fresh brewed ice-tea like everyone else has?  Service was good all around and the place was clean.  The restroom even had soap in the soap dispenser!  One confusing thing to me which I suppose could be a problem on a busy day is when the sandwich is done they just call out its number (i.e. \"Number 15\")...what happens on a busy day when maybe 3 people have the same order?  A brawl could ensue!  All in all it was a good place to grab a quick lunch since I was in the area.  Not sure I'd go out of my way to get here but if and when I'm driving by during lunch I will definitely stop back in to try another sandwich."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Jimmy Johns I have been to. The bread was hard as a rock and stale. Employees are not in a rush to help you, and took forever to get our sandwiches. Definitely not worthy of the Jimmy John name. It is very obvious reading the other reviews that there is some serious mismanagement/ ownership going on here. Will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Probably the worst location in the valley.  I love other locations I've been to.  This one, the service is below average and they act like they're doing you a favor."}
{"text":"Yeah, it's a chain, but I love me some Jimmy John's. As far as chain sandwich/sub shops go they've definitely got a good product. There's nothing unique about this location other than you have to walk down some stairs to a lower level to access the shop. Oh yeah, and parking is a bit of a pain in the ass but that's all of this stretch of Lakewood. Don't park in the lot across the street unless there's a meter. We got yelled at by the parking nazi.  The food was fresh, tasty, predictable and prepped quickly and the facilities were clean.  I have two complaints, though. The bathrooms are all the way through the back and down some creepy, dark hallway and the music in the place is way too loud. If I have to raise my voice to chat with my tablemate there's something wrong."}
{"text":"No matter which one I drop into, the staff is always friendly! And the sandwiches are FAST!  I have to admit, although they are know for their sub rolls, I like the sandwiches. The subs feel a bit to thin for my liking, but the sandwiches on sliced wheat bread are just right!  I use them at work, when I am feeding the staff. The app is amazingly simple and specific. Plus, I can request names on each sandwich! So much easier than opening and looking to figure out who gets what!"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's are all over the city, which is great because they are awesome. It took a few orders to figure out my favorite, because there are so many delicious combos!  If you are ordering for a gang of people - There website, and even though yelp app makes ordering SO CRAZY EASY!!!! Seriously! When I am in charge of getting lunch at work, this is one of my go-to places, because they rock with the large orders! Even write the names on the sandwiches!! And it is affordable!"}
{"text":"worst experience of my life.   I first called to order a sandwich at 9:00. 45 minutes later I call and they lost my address and my phone number. When I went ahead and told them my address, they still got \"lost\" and the girl tried to call me. I never received any calls.   Then the manager (Peter Kimball) called and he said that the employee couldn't find my address. This is even after I gave them directions to my apartment. He showed up 15 min later with a sandwich that had obviously been sitting out. I threw it away when I took the first bite. I hope they see this and take action. This was one of the worst experiences that I have had. They really need to get their act together.   In two days when the store manager is in, I will give him a call but tomorrow I'm going to call corporate.   I should have read the reviews, this place sucks. Take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"We are from San Diego... Husband lived in Chicago for a little while some time back. When we met he always ranted and raved about JJ's. I figured, it's a sub just like Subway, Quiznos, Submarina.....  Whoa! Whoa! I WAS WRONG. JJ'S is what's up. The bread alone is AMAZING! Every time we come to Vegas this location is must.   We got sandwiches on the way home this past weekend, tossed em on ice in the cooler and ate em for lunch the next day. Guess what, still phenomenal!  I usually get the Night Club with peppers or the Beach Club. The beach club travels well. That's what we both got to take with. Add bacon of course.  Don't be fooled, there's no place like it. There are no imitations, substitutions or good excuses to not go. Period."}
{"text":"First time here and they have everything but turkey. Second time I went to drive thru and waited a minute no one is there. It might be too early for someone at 9am but the store is open. This location needs some work."}
{"text":"I don't get the fascination with this place.  I mean, it's OK, but I don't see where there is anything really trend setting or spectacular. It's a glorified Quiznos, but the bread is not as good.  I got the Billy Club sandwich. The bread was a simple 8\" white bread sub. Plain jane. The ingredients were fresh, but the sandwich was $8. That's twice what you'd pay at Subway. I'm not saying Subway is better, but it's not much worse.  Bottom line... decent sandwiches but over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"This is a really nice Jimmy Johns, especially for being located in Elyria. The place looks clean and modern. Has a drive through. The employees are polite and well spoken. Ok so this review makes me sound old, but most fast food places aren't this nice. I will be back."}
{"text":"I like the BLT at jimmy johns. This is a good location too. They will deliver one sandwich and won't get uptight about it. Just tip the driver. Takes about 15 min from the time you order one sandwich to get it at your door in Tremont. This is a great alternative to drunk driving."}
{"text":"I was starving.... I'm pregnant. I remember the \"freaky fast delivery\"..... 37 minutes later the guy shows up... Forgets my drink (which I was craving) asked me if I was sure I ordered it... Which I rudely handed him my ticket showing I paid for it. Rolls his eyes stating he would be back with my drink which I declined because I'm sure by the time he would have came back my food would have been gone... THEN tried to take all of my cash! I'm like.... Can I have my money for the drink back? The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the sand which is still good. Bad rating for service. I'm also about 1.5 miles away. Terrible service. Great food."}
{"text":"Fast food. Literally, that's all you'll really get.   I've been here a few times now and I think the novelty has worn off. I get it, you make sandwiches very quickly and for the most part they're mediocre and a tad overpriced.   My most recent visit here had me craving a tuna sandwich with sprouts. After staring down at my belly for a brief moment and wondering if in 9 months I would become a scientific anomaly, I walked up and ordered said sandwich from the emotionless cashier. After waiting what seemed like an eternity (2 minutes, which is long for this place) I hungrily unwrapped my sammie and discovered this thing was about 50% bread, 20% lettuce, 15% sprouts, 5% cheese, and the rest was made up of tuna salad. I was pretty disappointed in this, because in my past visits, my sammie has been a lot more evenly distributed and hearty.   I dug through what could only be described as the front yard of an unkempt lawn and I finally found the base of this sandwich. The bread was a little tough and not easy to bite through. I'm not too fond of of their bread here anyways and I wish they had more carb loaded hoagie options other than white bread. They do carry different bread options, but no hoagie shaped variations. The tuna was... well... not my favorite and it had a taste that was a little off. I'm still live today and I feel fine, so it wasn't a \"fresh thing\". It was just a flavor thing, lots of onions. Not my bag baby!   Like mentioned earlier in this review, what's with the emotionless cashiers?... \"Just give me your order, your money, and step aside bro.\",  I'm not complaining, but just an observation. I don't think I will be back to Jimmy John's anytime soon unless I need a turkey sandwich made in less than 1 minute. I will probably just got to Port of Subs and wait 4 minutes for it, gives me some time to check emails.  This is really a 2.5 star review, but their bathroom humor earned that extra .5."}
{"text":"Not food related, but I just had one of the delivery drivers pull out right in front of me, after I swerved around him to not run into him, he gave me the finger! Wow, pretty professional... Driving a gold colored SUV with a bunch of flags on it."}
{"text":"I don't think I've had a more annoying delivery order. Took 50 mins and multiple calls to get my sandwich. I even asked to come pick it up but it was already on the way. I tipped the guy still even though I wanted to give 0 only because he was nice and I felt guilty. My sandwich isn't even what I ordered and even paid extra for different meat. Freaky fast delivery? How about order some more staff!   I called to let her know it was wrong after the long wait and she said they would send me the correct sandwich. No one delivered the right sandwich."}
{"text":"Great place! We order delivery from here frequently... And they are always quick and kind. Tonight, they were running behind schedule on delivery, and the manager on shift called to tell me they were running behind! Who does that!? Wonderful customer service. Thanks team! You all rock."}
{"text":"It never ceases to amaze me how fast the people are here. It literally takes me longer to wait in line at the traffic signal turn lane then it does to park, get inside, get my sandwich, pay, and get out. I've been here several times after work and the people are always really friendly. The store is very clean and well kept. I normally prefer hot subs, but I'll make an exception for this Jimmy Johns location. These guys (and gals) are amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent staff and friendly, fast service.  Food is great with good portions to go with it. They keep a clean store and a good all throughout vibe in the restaurant that will invite you back for more."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are definitely over-priced and not very good. It's an okay sandwich for lunch when you're in a pinch or if you're on a road trip. But, much, much better sandwich shops around for better prices without a doubt. GANDOLFOS is by far superb compared to JJ's."}
{"text":"I have tried Jimmy John's once before and wasn't impressed by my sandwich. After ordering it along with a group of coworkers and trying something else I must say it has raised the bar for my Jimmy John's experience. Still not my favorite sub place but I definitely love the convenience of delivery when I don't have time to go for lunch. The bread is a little tougher than I prefer sometimes but their avocado spread is pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"Meh. Sandwiches were very thin.    Counter person gave us attitude because there was no tip.  Why would I tip when picking up?    I'm not impressed.  I'll take my business elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Perfect location right next to the movie theater in tempe marketplace. i always grab a small sub to sneak into the movie. Mostly i go with the plan slim's which is basically just bread & meat some have cheese and my only complaint is they won't add anything like mayo, mustard to it. you have to get the packets of mustard or may. But i make do and just do turkey w mayo. The slims are cheap around $2-3 and are enough to fill me up. They are quick and can make one in about 30 seconds you're in and out the door."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's. I love Jimmy John's so much I used to drive clear out to Baseline & Rural from my home in Downtown Phoenix just to get a tasty sandwich fix.  Guess what! I don't have to drive far at all now!  The newest Jimmy John's is open just eight blocks from my office in the Camelback corridor.  I've been waiting anxiously for this shop to open, and when I noticed today that it's up and running, I knew what I was having for lunch.  I took with me a co-worker who is a self-proclaimed sandwich lover.  We went around 11:30am ready to enjoy a tasty sub,  Upon entering, we were greeted enthusiastically by the ten or so people standing around and behind the counter.  It was a bit surprising, but not in a bad way.  You could tell the staff was trained to be friendly and welcoming to all who entered - each patron who came in after us was greeted the same way.  I knew what I wanted and ordered right away and my co-worker made her selection, as well.  As expected, I hadn't even finished filling my drink before my #16 Club Lulu (no mayo, add cheese) was ready.  We sat down with our sandwiches, ate, and talked about all of the different sandwiches they have available.  Jimmy John's never fails to meet my expectations.  The sandwiches are tasty and filling, the service is friendly, and fast, and it's a meal definitely worth every penny!"}
{"text":"The rudest place I've ever been. We came up to the counter. The checkout girl just stared at us and never asked what we'd like. She just stood and stared...if we asked questions she stared. Asked for mustard she stared. Asked about the menu she stared.. Like seriously..what the heck. Food was ok. But I'd never ever go back."}
{"text":"Had a opportunity to eat here last week for the first time! Daughter has been raving about their BLT! So I ordered their 8\" BLT sandwich on wheat! It was very good, had no complaints about them. But it was no different then any other sub shop? Their BLT was your basic bacon, lettuce, and tomato. It had a special mayo on it, gave a unique taste. Sandwich could have had more bacon? But I would and probably will come back again!"}
{"text":"Best place for sandwiches.  Always served fresh and taste great.  I go here often usually saturday mornings around 9am and always get the Italian night out with extra mayo.  Must try their tuna sandwich from their big sandwich menu, best I've ever had.  Friendly people great you as you enter and leave."}
{"text":"I went there today around 2pm. I ordered the gargantuan sandwich, 2 of them. They were really good. The service was quick, friendly & clean. A very pleasant experience. I will be back."}
{"text":"Called my jimmy johns driver less than 15 seconds after he called me who told me he was already back at the store because \"my directions were useless\" (how do you make it back to the store in less then 10 seconds) then called the store to see what was going on who told me the delivery driver was having bike pump problems all night so he was crabby & would talk to him, (who's also had said hasn't been back to the store since he's left with my order). My parents are in town and was just trying to get dinner for all of us. Constantly order from this JJ's but won't be anymore because of this mans service."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns, but this location needs some serious help.  I consider myself a regular and am in there atleast once a week.  Literally every time I my (very easy) order is wrong.  I even had a catering order a few months back for a birthday party and specifically had them put no mayo on all sandwiches.  The girl read it back to me and all sandwiches came to my door with mayo.  I called the manager and literally he seemed annoyed, but had them come back and redo the order.  As a manager, I feel like some comps could have been made since my food arrived after the start of the party.  To top it off most of the staff is unfriendly and totally doesn't live up to the Jimmy Johns name."}
{"text":"It's Jimmy John's! If you been to one you've been to them all.  Doesn't mean it isn't still good. Brand new location, but the sandwiches still taste good. And that bread! Oh that damn bread!   This location seems a bit smaller than some of the other ones. There doesn't seem to be as much seating. And some of the seating they do have seems to be real close together. But that's nitpicking. I come for the sandwiches and they're good like always. If it ain't broke don't fix it."}
{"text":"I've ordered here 4 times since opening. I was very excited it was opening in the neighborhood. Each time it has taken freakishly way too LONG. I ordered tonight hoping that they've gotten everything organized since opening months ago. No such luck. 38 minutes later (2 blocks away, yes I am lazy) delivery made. Not freakishly fast in my dictionary. :("}
{"text":"This is the best JJs in Champaign. Does Jimmy read these? If so I'd appreciate if you opened a JJs in my new location in Laguna Beach so I can enjoy my beach club on wheat again."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this chain.  This particular loctation didn't have any waiting area .  I wasn't impressed with the staff at all.  The 2 cashiers weren't very friendly and never gave me a total or asked if I wanted a receipt.  My sandwich was good, but I feel it was over priced for what I got.  My husband asked for no tomatoes or onions and received extra of both.  I was shocked when we asked for pickles and we were told they don't do sliced pickles.  There seemed to be a lot of people working behind the counter, almost too many as they were bumping into eachother.  I would give it one more try and then decide after that if I would go back."}
{"text":"Tried here twice now once just days after they opened and again a few days ago and I have to say I am not impressed at paying twice subway prices for half the sandwich.  The meat here is ok but nothing great and I think the meat at whole foods next store is a whole lot better tasting and less processed. They lack some very simple sub veggies like pickles and olives. I can't believe they don't have pickle chips or at least spears but will charge $1 for the same claussen pickle i can get a jar of for $5.  The sandwich itself is overpriced and small at about the same length of a subway 6\" but half the width. At $7 for this sub I would at least expect more meat than subway but it is about the same.  I also have had my order done incorrectly twice now and i didn't think no mayo, add oil and vinegar with all the veggies and hot peppers is that complex.  For the money I am going to walk in to whole foods and get one of their great sandwhiches for about a $1 more and are twice the size and usually leave me with leftovers and while I am there I may even buy a jar of pickles."}
{"text":"I have always ordered sandwiches online from jimmy johns because it's super quick and easy and they always remember every item, straw, napkins ect. Recently I had issues with the website changing my address before checkout, which really isn't a huge deal because you can just call and order to the correct address, or they would figure it out and reroute me automatically (I think I order there too much), so I was really impressed when the manager, John, took it upon himself to contact IT and have this fixed. He not only took care of a meal for me, he had the issue resolved within a week and was a pleasure to deal with. As a person with plenty of experience in the industry, these types of issues usually get pushed aside for more immediate and problematic issues so I was really impressed with his promptness and attention. Thank you John!"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is a staple classic for a late-night snack after the bars in Bloomington, Indiana, home of Indiana University. Was so happy to see it expand into Arizona. My staple is the #12 -- Beach Club. Can't go wrong with having it on the multi-grain bread or the french bread. Many friends swear by the Turkey Tom, but I find it to be too plain. Service is rapid and I have NEVER waited longer than 40 seconds for my sandwich after ordering."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed. When you call yourself a gourmet sandwich shop, it must be better than subway.  When I first walked in, there was no customers in the store at all. I was not greeted at all by the 4 workers that were working there. What was even worse was when I got up to the counter, I was met with the \"stupid\" stare like I should have just automatically started ordering and that I was a bother to her.  When you have a new business, a worker like that can have such a negative impact on your future.  Then there was the food. You get less meat than subway, less vegetables, in fact you don't get a choice I guess, and the bread tasted like it was a couple of days old and not fresh. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Quick service and tasty food, the speed for having my order ready was very fast...freaky fast"}
{"text":"Super speedy service and excellent quality sandwich. I placed my order and then received my order within 15 minutes of calling it in.  It arrived and was very tasty and exactly what I wanted.   Can't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"Addicted.  The bread alone is AMAZING.  Talk about fast....I got my sandwich before I was even done paying for it.  Delivery is just the same.  I placed an order online and it was delivered in 11 minutes.  11 minutes?????  Who delivers that fast?? These guys."}
{"text":"Would be coming back only if JIMMY JOHN'S head is mounted on the wall! Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"A sandwich shop near a University?  Thats about as novel as a Starbucks in an airport terminal. The UNLV adjacent area is littered with the usual suspects but they also have Mid West staple Jimmy John's throwing their hat into the ring.  While it diversifies the sandwich portfolio, I dont necessarily think it strengthens it.  Thats not to say you cant get a satisfying meal here...  Located in a small strip mall across from the campus, Jimmy John's has a fresh, clean aesthetic and cheerful college kids that keep the place humming.  The roster of sandwiches isnt overwhelming yet most people can find something that suits their tastes.  Ingredients are fresh and simple, yet nothing really wows you.  There are some more novel items like sprouts and 7 grain bread that can be added as accoutrement which is nice if you're looking for a different taste than most chains.    I find myself at Jimmy Johns from time to time because of its convenience and because I can get a fairly healthy meal there.  When I go, I like the Veggie, Italian and California sandwiches.  None of them will knock your socks off, but you'll still leave in a good mood.....that is if your not starving when you get there.  My one major complaint is the size of the sandwiches and the amount of meat they put in them.  While not expensive (5 to 6 dollar range) they are smaller than I would like.  Im not asking for Cheesecake Factory portions here, but a little girth would be nice.  Maybe its my inner fatboy complaining, but usually my inner fatboy doesn't lie on these matters.  You're from the Mid West Jimmy!  Appetites are hearty there, make your sandwiches reflect that!  Overall a decent, if unspectacular place to grab a quick bite.  I'll be back I'm sure..just like I'm back at those dang Starbucks counters at the airport.  Ubiquity has gotten the best of me!!!!"}
{"text":"Methinks not is right! Some sort of catered party tray of sandwiches we got at our office, and one of the half sandwiches I got, which was small enough anyway, contained one very thin slice of meat.  Another one I tried contained a small amount of roast beef.  You'd expect extras of oil, vinegar, etc, but all we got were mostly mustard packets, and a only a few mayo packets for 35 plus half sandwiches. Not sure where the gourmet part comes in, but it sure doesn't for their party platters!!!!  Incredibly disappointing."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's. The staff is always friendly and inviting and the bread is always so fresh. My only gripe that I will not deduct a star for is the fact that is your order a skinny they will not put mayo on it for you. They will offer mayo packets instead.... Lame... Either way this is a good place and it's clean inside."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for the second time tonight and for the second time the delivery took over 45 minutes!  I don't think this store has watched their commercials about how super fast their delivery is supposed to be!"}
{"text":"As someone who ordered a few times a month I was surprised at the nearly $5.00 delivery charge which does not go to the driver.  So,  ordering for me and my son,  with tip delivery cost me $9.00. For less than a mile!  Boo Jimmy Johns.  You got greedy."}
{"text":"This place is great!! Excellent subs. Quick service. And fresh food!  I think what I like most is their bread is always so fresh tasting!  So when I have to choose between Subway and Jimmy Johns I usually pick Jimmy Johns.  I like the slim subs because they are smaller and the perfect amount for me. Great price too! Perfect to grab before a day at the lake or pool."}
{"text":"I go to jimmy johns because it's quick, cheap and usually fairly decent and let's be honest, better than subway. Very disappointed with my sandwich today. I got a 4.99 sub and asked for extra avocado. They over charged me for two extra avocados and on top of that it had so little avocado on it that I could taste it. Mean less to say I got an over priced tasteless sub. See my photos if you think I'm kidding."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was worried after trying to place my order that I wouldn't be writing a good review for this place, but I am so happy to say I was wrong.  I went in with my mom and we wanted to share a sandwich and since we don't like the same things on our subs, we asked to have the onions on the side.  We were told they couldn't do that and aren't allowed to.  Seemed strange to me, but whatever.  The team working didn't seem to know much about the menu either, but I have to say that our sandwich was great.  A simple ham and cheese but the bread was great and all of the fixings were fresh and tasty.  Beware of the hot peppers...they are serious!  Overall, since the food is the most important part, this place is worth it."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is my favorite sandwich spot! I especially enjoy the #3 totally tuna. The delivery guys are always fast and very polite. Thank you for making great sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I come in here a lot and Jimmy Johns is jimmy johns. I will say that I always get great service here, they deliver, they're open late, like really late so check the hours. If your carb conscious get it unwiched, without bread as a lettuce wrap.  Love the #5 Vito its my fav. Love the downtown feel of being right in Coventry. Park in the street or in the muni deck. Discounts for city employees."}
{"text":"I never knew before because I never asked... the reason why the \"giant\" club sandwiches are $2 more than the 8\" clubs is because they scoop out the inside of the bread on the 8\" clubs. If you want the bread left in, then you pay $2 more. Wow... so you're just throwing away all the extra bread for the people who buy the 8\" clubs? Your \"giant club sandwiches\" are not giant at all. They are the same size! They just have all of the bread in them, and maybe a little bit of extra veggies. And by extra veggies they put on more lettuce. Wow, just wow. I'm glad I found this out today. Jimmy John's will no longer get my business. No other sandwich company does this. You can get a 12 INCH sub at Subway for $5 and they don't scoop out their bread. How shady and wasteful."}
{"text":"Fast, drive up window, and quality samiches!"}
{"text":"Ordered a #5, nobody asked me what I wanted on it in the way of oil and vinegar, They sure did not put any on it. There was no condiments anywhere to be seen, and no salt or pepper.  No napkins put out and they were stingy with the ones that were.  Sandwich was bland, and boring.  Service was incredibly fast for lunch time, but That only got them 1 more star.   Put condiments out, and napkins and don't preach about how many I can use with diatribes printed on the table. I will use what I want."}
{"text":"Terrible asked for the #9 no onion. They put onions and no mayo, my husband ordered the BLT and it had turkey. What in the world!? Go to another location."}
{"text":"Do you ever feel as though you' ve been red-carded by life itself? Sitting it out on the sidelines in some metaphorical penalty box until the economy recovers? I do.  Wall Street I hate you. You stole my money and investments, leaving me to subsist on sandwiches and cheap Mexican instead of steak and halibut.  But I'm a trooper.  Making the best of a bad sitch.  Adapting. Becoming one with the ninety-nine percenters, after my one percent fall from grace.  Jimmy Johns is a big part of my 'penalty-box' plan until my next ship comes in.  The Italian and the tuna are all I ever order. Both delish. Their bread is thin, without all that crumb....great if you're counting carbs. Unfortunately, that's all I've got left to count these days. Fuck you Wall Street.  Sorry, I didn't mean to curse.  Yeah, no...I did.  Fuck you again Wall Street!!!"}
{"text":"Owner and General Manager need to know that you have an employee that has no handicap plate nor plaquer for handicap, parked in a handicapped spot at the hospital at 51st and Baseline for more than 15 minutes to make a delivery! This was the only handicap spot left. AND, it's illegal to park in these spots without any signage on your car to do so! This post has gone viral on FB and not by me! I came across it and I am reposting here!"}
{"text":"This place made me not want to go back to jimmy johns again. They made my sandwich so fast they forgot to add lettuce! And then when I did come back to have some put on my sandwich they added a lot like it was grass for an Easter basket! Also they forgot to give me the side of pickles we had ordered.After coming back from already getting home, they didn't even apologize, horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  It's a chain sandwich joint.  Just because sprouts and cucumber come on sandwiches without asking doesn't mean it is fresh and natural.  Don't get me wrong...it's fine.  But it's nothing special beyond any other franchise sandwich."}
{"text":"Got 3 subs, all with no tomato... and we all got tomatoes. This location used to be great, but has been slowly going downhill."}
{"text":"The first time I was introduced to Jimmy John's was at this very store. Not being a big chain-sandwich regular, I was a bit leery about being my patronage here. I was happily surprised to find a cheerful (but not annoyingly cheerful) staff that made my sandwich is what seemed like 5.7 seconds. I was afraid it would be carelessly thrown together given it's rapid construction but was more than impressed to find it self standing and structurally confident. The taste was commendable. It wasn't the great sandwich ever put together, but it might be the fasted to be assembled. Since JJ's prides itself on its speedy sandwiches, I can only say, bravo.  Also, I'm very appreciative of the late hours of operation."}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches. This place is simple and has basically one thing subs. They are all really good and fresh and made really quickly even if there is a long line. Make sure to order yours with hot peppers. For sure my favorite one there is the Italian Night Club!"}
{"text":"Place exceptionally clean.  Beef sandwich was good however wish more meat was put on the sandwich. Later discovered at an additional cost you can add more meat."}
{"text":"Love this Jimmy John's and get delivery from this location pretty often. Sometimes takes closer to 30 mins which isn't freaky fast but still pretty quick when comparing to other delivery. Will say usually have the same delivery guy deliver and he never has a pen so have a pen ready!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Jimmy Johns sandwiches :-) All of their restaurants I have visited around the valley have been great. The employees are helpful, upbeat, and always ready to take my order. I have never been to a food establishment that makes your order as quickly as they do and have not once messed one up. If you need a tasty place that you can get in and out, this is the place. Just like one of their creative signs around their restaurant, \"My mouth isn't watering, it's just crying for Jimmy Johns!\""}
{"text":"Great customer service, the guy who took our order was very friendly! My only complaint was that of the sandwiches was on burnt bread and tasted very stale. I was fairly disappointed when I got home and opened the wrapper. Better luck next time, I guess!"}
{"text":"Nothin fancy about this Jimmy Johns. Great sandwiches, fast service and it won't ever disappoint. Great option if you're tired of the subway and port of subs down the street."}
{"text":"My husband and I will choose this place before ever going to Subway, Port of Subs, or even Capriotti's yummy sandwiches, delicious bread, and that vinegarette sauce on the VITO is yummy too!   VITO is obviously the favorite.  JJ gargantuan is so good too!   Our favorite recommendations!"}
{"text":"Hey, the service was great. Friendly kids who got me my food fast.  The food is seriously lacking. I guess I got the impression they were supposed to be a higher end sub shop, but you're just paying more money for what amounts to a smaller Subway sandwich. It gave my dog gas. Pass on this one."}
{"text":"The new place is great! They used to be at whole foods plaza, now they are behind chevron gas station across the street.  Now it's Way bigger and spacious, plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Easy access and parking.  Same great subs. My fav its #4.  They also have great catering options.  And when we are lazy, we just use their freaky fast delivery."}
{"text":"Go here often, food is usually prepared correctly and is good. Although all the young employees are much more interested in, and busy with, chatting among themselves.   My last sandwich  order to go I took back to my office and discovered it was dry, no mayo at all. Just the meat and tomatoes.  The employee who prepared it seemed annoyed at having to stop her conversation with her coworker to make my sandwich. She was not rude, but was barely cordial.   I'll keep getting food here. I love Jimmy John's, this one just needs to work on customer service."}
{"text":"I am always in search of good food fast...not fast food! I think Jimmy John's knows what they are doing, and should continue to knock out those sandwiches, FAST.  I love that I can pretty much know, I will a) Not wait in line and b) be in and out in 2 to 5 minutes flat! Heck yeah! And get a very tasty filling sub.  I recommend the Lulu, it is very good, and has tons of meat.  Oh, don't waste your hard earned money on the Avocado. This is my only complaint about Jimmy John's, they have pureed avocado and just spread it on like it is mayo, only they don't put much on. I think it is a waste of money.  This is my go to lunch place when I am in a hurry!"}
{"text":"I don't like to waste my time and money on an average sandwich so I never go to most sub shops. I grew up in a neighborhood with an authentic Italian deli where they made great subs. When I spent summers visiting Phili as a kid, my dad took me to the best hoggie shops. I'm biased and I don't eat meat. Another non meat, Mia, works at Jimmy Johns and offered to share a sub with me one day. Well, that did it and I was hooked. Then I discovered freaky fast is all about. I'm usually so busy that I think I don't have time for lunch but then there's Jimmy John's fast. I know that from the time I walk into the shop and walk out it's going to be less than five minutes usually. And they deliver. Enough said. I get the veggie with extra oregano and peppers and veggies. So good and great service. Thank you Mia!"}
{"text":"Your standard Jimmy John's. Good food and good service, not as fast as at other Jimmy Johns but still good. We ordered two unwiches,  mine was a totally tuna that I added bacon to. The lettuce was still pretty wet, but that happens at a lot of locations. If you're in the area and looking for a good quick bite, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice Job!! First time ordering Jimmy Johns and took advantage of the delivery service also! Timely service...ordered at 7:40 and the order was on the table at 7:53! More impressive the sandwich was amazing!! Fresh ingredients on soft bread that was tasty!! I had the BLT and although not fancy a Classic that was delicious! Thanks Jimmy!! Well Done!! P.S. Bike delivery guy was super polite!!"}
{"text":"Place an order assume everything is good 20 minutes later nothing we call back they said they needed to know if it was cash or charge prior to making the order? never called us back said they did finally we told them it was Cash then and only then did they start making the order 20 minutes later $34 for two sandwich combos two bags of chips two cookies and two sodas the food was tasteless what do we pay for? It looked like two 6 inch Subway sandwiches for $ 5 at least at Subway you get a five dollar footlong not a six inch $15 sub"}
{"text":"I have been there 3 times,  everytime I get not a very good sandwich . Today I got a sandwich from Jimmy Johns and the bread was stale hard to chew I believe I will not go there again it is not a sandwich shop it's more of a I don't now don't eat there I'm talking about the one on windmill at Las Vegas in Nevada shitty Bread. staff members are good."}
{"text":"Great food, I have no complaints. I always get the number 16 or the number 12 with bacon. Gotta grab the salt and vinegar chips as well!"}
{"text":"first time 4 jimmy johns,had turkey lunch box,bread lettuce tomato ratio 2 meat was very poor ,will never go back worst sandwiche ever had"}
{"text":"This is the least impressive sub place on Green (lots of competition), failing to beat either price or flavor. The food isn't bad, but it isn't really good, either. It is, however, blazing fast. Plus, they give away free training samples on campus sometimes, which is pretty neat."}
{"text":"I do like the Club Tuna and the Cali Club is ordered a lot at our home.  The bread is my least favorite vessel for the delivery of delicious tuna and vegetables, but it'll suffice. We also order chips to place upon the goodness that is the sandwich, because 'Merica.  And it's crunchy (plus the sandwich could use a little more flava...add hot peppers here).  The delivery charge sucks but it's cheaper than a DUI and doesn't involve getting dressed to enter the public realm so we sacrifice our couple of dollars.  Also, I'd be less annoyed ordering via phone if a: the website was more reliable via the phone or tablet app, b: anybody on the other end could stop interrupting me to ask me the question I'm going to tell them the answer to prior to the asking, and c: turn the damn music down for your employees so they can actually hear the customer.  Both times I've been in the store I've had to basically yell, and since I don't hear well in loud environments I absolutely refuse to enter by foot, and you'd have to hold a gun to my head to get me to use the drive through.  Enough blabbering though, the food is fresh, good to eat, and easy to prepare."}
{"text":"Love ordering from JJ while at work. Speedy delivery every time I order whether online or by phone. And the salt and vinegar chips are the bomb! I plan to  try other sandwiches but I always crave the #10 roast beef and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's.  The bread is delicious, toppings are plentiful and everyone says goodbye to me when I leave. The Beach Club is my favorite. It has the perfect balance of turkey, provolone, avocado, lettuce, sprouts, mayo, cucumber and tomato. I do not have to add anything. This location has hot peppers that you can add for free. The pickles are a must if you enjoy a crunchy, yummy side to your sandwich. The chips are yummy, BBQ is my fave. The only downside to this location is there is no Coke Zero, but I compromise by adding a splash of regular Coke to my cup full of Diet Coke.  Every visit to this location has been 5 stars!  I love Jimmy John's.  Torrance loves Sharon, so he loves Jimmy John's too."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's sandwiches. Specifically # 12, The Beach Club. Today, I was feeling like a little something different, so my coworker suggested I try adding bacon. Hello delicious! I have a new favorite. My other new favorite is that sweetie behind the counter, Myles.  We walked in with our office sandwich list and completed the order and paid within 2 minutes. Super fast cashier. We stood by the pick up counter and I forgot to order the boss his requested wheat bread. I asked the guy making sandwiches if it was already made, he stated yes. I said oh shizz, I forgot to get the ham on wheat. MYLES (said sweetie) told me no problem, he would quickly make another. And he flashed a dazzling Orbitz smile! Attention Mr. Jimmy John's, please recognize Myles for his super awesome customer service skills. If I didn't love your #12, I would still come back and recommend this place because of the way MY OWN mistake was handled. Please consider me a customer for life and consider including a Yelp check in offer too."}
{"text":"This location is not as busy as others. I like that, but I expect it to get busier as more people notice it as they are driving by Sunset Station. Like other locations, the staff of friendly and quick with your order. The prices are good and food really tasty. I have just recently discovered the wheat bread. It makes a yummy sandwich and feels hearty and healthy at the same time. Don't get me wrong, I do love the white bread, but I am very happy with my sandwich when I ask for wheat. The menu reflects alfalfa sprouts, but don't bother asking, they haven't had any in months at other locations, so it seems unlikely they will bring it back. I like that you can add cucumbers for free and get a yummy pickle in your combo instead of a bag of chips. Not as many veggies as subway, but it is a much tastier sandwich."}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst Jimmy John's I have ever been to (and I've lived all over the US frequenting Jimmy John's all over the country).  I've always loved this chain to get a quick sub, but this place has failed 3 times in the past month.  I was in Desert Ridge a month ago, and wanted to grab a quick bite so I stopped in.  They told me they had no bread left (this was around 1pm on a weekend!), so I left.  Last weekend I stopped in again on a Sunday afternoon, and ordered a turkey sub.  Once I paid they let me know it would be about a 10 minute wait while they cut the turkey (not the fast sub I was hoping for but I waited), and while I waited a bunch of people came in to order.  25 minutes later I got my sub.  I just went in today (give them one more chance), and as I approached the cashier, she started yelling at her cash register and told me it was \"stupid\" and not working...pretty professional.  I ordered my sandwich (pretty much standard from the menu) and when they handed it to me they said it had Dijon on it.  I let them know I didn't ask for Dijon, so they took it back, didn't remake it, and handed to me in about 15 seconds.  I asked how they remade it that quick and the girl said \"I just removed it\".  It was the worst tasting sub I've eaten at a Jimmy Johns (not sure what they did), and I will definitely never stop there again.  Three strikes you're out Jimmy John's!"}
{"text":"This review applies to all locations, this sub shop franchise should be sued for false advertising. I had to buy a few lunches at their Galleria location and this is my experience.  1: The \"home cooked\" bread is not even close to resembling or tasting of French bread - or like Italian either. Wonder bread and mayo is what it tastes like, totally unacceptable in 2012 when you can buy a semi decent French baguette in any supermarket.   2: \"No can toast the bread, sorry\". Really??????   3: There's nothing remotely gourmet about any of their ingredients, cold cuts, cheeses, salads, nothing.   4: False cheers are simply annoying  Just a few blocks North on Monroe is  \"The Southern Gourmet\" cafe. Now the sandwiches cost twice as much and the service is sloooooooow but the food is a gourmet treat."}
{"text":"This place really is subs so fast you'll freak   I came into jimmy John's the place was practically empty. When I was done ordering my sandwiches was already done. Highly impressive this place had friendly fast and efficient employees . I ordered the country club and the beach club. Everything was  so good , I  looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"good subs and great speedy service.  i always have got my sub with in 7 minutes."}
{"text":"Love this place because they are SUPER fast with delivery and always friendly. I just wish they had more veggies to choose from since the vegetarian sub only comes with a few things."}
{"text":"Good Sandwiches... Good Prices    I stop at Jimmy Johns  occasionaly for lunch or dinner. Jimmy John's convenient location & excellent service keeps me coming back. The food at Jimmy Johns is fresh, the service is fast,  and the prices are great.  I have to admit I like Jimmy Johns.  The restaurant are always clean every time I visit, which is really important. One of the things I like best about Jimmy John's is that they  slice their own meat and bake their own bread; now that is what I call freshness.   The atmosphere at Jimmy John's is great, the signs on the walls are very funny.  The subs are super filling and they only cost $4.50.   If you're looking for a great tasting sub, then this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich and great prices. These guys stay open late and have better sandwiches then subway."}

{"text":"JJ Gargantuan is really delicious!  Also the bread was fresher than the other locations I've tried."}
{"text":"I was not a fan of the bread because it made my mouth sore all over. They're really skimpy on the deli meats - really disappointing seeing that it was supposed to come with 3 meats but I could only taste a HINT of salami.  I don't even like Subway that much but I think they are way better (and quicker too) .. It felt ironic that they take pride in speed yet it took almost 10 mins for an untoasted sandwich lol in fact 2 people who ordered after me got their sandwiches first so I was probably forgotten."}
{"text":"I walked in and was immediately greeted. I ordered two Turkey Tom's the way I like them paid  and waited at the end. A very polite young lady handed me my sandwiches and sides in a bag with napkins and a menu and  I was out the door. Super quick service ! I was in and out in about 10 minutes tops.The store was clean all the employees were very attentive and professional.   The bread and everything in between was fresh and tasty. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Love this Jimmy John's! Great subs and customer service and always super fast and friendly delivery drivers! And the general manager at this store is awesome too!"}
{"text":"This location is clean, staff is efficient, orders are fulfilled very fast. I come here when I am in a hurry and usually am in and out in about 10 min including gobbling down my  8\" sandwich. My go to is original Totally Tuna with crispy veggies, fresh white bun and tuna itself. Yum"}
{"text":"Best Sandwich shop ever!  Huuuge  subs.  Quality is A+"}
{"text":"I have to say that I am not a huge fan of their subs. The subs to me never have any real flavor. Also, they hardly give you any meat and stuff their subs with lettuce. I've eaten at several location, not by choice of course. And I have to say that this location has one girl who works there that is kind of rude. The last time I went I ordered the Vito sub and was told that I can have hot peppers in the sandwich for free but if I wanted them in the side I would need to pay extra, why? And of course to top it off I got home and my sandwich was completely dry. Hardly any mayo, mustard or the Italian dressing. Defiantly will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"First off a turkey Tom , extra mayo, add cheese is my favorite:) With that being said the service is always friendly at this location.  My food is always fresh. Made the way I want . When I do get delivery they are always on point . Thanks again jimmy johns !! Ok so I just ordered an other turkey Tom the way I like it ! Can't wait to get it ! FREAKY FAST !!!"}
{"text":"Worst. Sub. Ever.  I fail to understand why this place is popular and why other locations consistantly get good reviews but Jimmy Johns is seriously one of the worst sub joints on the planet. Think of the last time you ate a sub sandwich from a hospital or 7-11 or anywhere else that has pre-made subs in their fridge. Those are better.   I actually went to Jimmy John's only because it was recommended to me due to other healthy stuff to eat in the area. After ordering my sandwich, I should have known something was amiss when they handed my sandwich to me immediately after taking my money.   Wait a minute, don't they need to prepare it...? Nope. Ready made. Just like you like it, right!? Well, okay, I figured that I could live with a ready-made sandwich if it was mind-blowingly delicious. After all, they must have them ready to go because they are in such high demand from being so ridiculously tasty. Also wrong.  It tasted like a cold, flavorless mess with no adornments whatsoever. Not only that, it was a good $2-3 more than subway which was half a mile down the road.  I will certainly not be visiting again. If I want hospital food, I will rupture my appendix. Actually, since I already did that, I will shoot for the gall bladder next time."}
{"text":"Usually have great service with this location, however today I didn't get tomatoes on my sandwich. I decide to call the store and let them know my problem and that I'm about half way done eating. I talk to a manager and he just tells me \"well I didn't make your sandwich but they said they put tomatoes on it,\" -not taking any kind of responsibility. Then he places me on hold for 4+ minutes. He advised me he'll have a fresh order made, and this time I ask that they do send the mayo and mustard packets (which Daniel says is not on the receipt) and actually call me before they are at the address given, like I requested. Daniel, seems almost argumentative at this point, rudely tells me they'll call me before delivery and to not eat anymore of the messed up food.   When I called all I wanted was for them to know that the food I paid for was not made correctly, but after that horrible phone call, I did request a new meal.    ****update: the driver did not call ahead to let me know he was on his way-I was on break and had to walk from work so if he was left waiting that's his problem I tried to prevent  Same driver as before, whom I tipped $5 because he waited on me the first time, handed me my correct order and did not say a word even to say your welcome.  I'll stick to the Dysart location, even though it is the same owners, I hope management is better over there."}
{"text":"The sandwich tasted fine, but the staff was super distracted. The slowest experience I've ever had at Jimmy Johns. Freaky SLOW!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, and they are real fast.  This place was very clean and the employees were nice.  Yet also have good ice, the tiny ice cubes!"}
{"text":"I was leaving Arrowhead in late August when I saw a sign that said \"Jimmy John's - Coming Soon!\"  Needless to say I sort of freaked out because up until today I've only been able to have JJ's when I visit my hometown.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a bunch of smiling faces. The service was pleasant and they got our order right the first time. The speed in which the make the sandwiches/subs at JJ's never ceases to amaze..  I got my usual-- #14 Bootlegger Club. It's roast beef, turkey, lettuce, tomato and mayo. It's a super simple yet classic sub. I also had a giant pickle on the side. The bread was super fresh, soft on the inside and a nice crunchiness on the outside.   I'm hoping we get a few more of these throughout the Valley because as soon as JJ's can deliver to my office I'm giving them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The founder of Jimmy Johns kills elephants, lions and other animals for fun. I won't spend a dime of my money in this establishment. There are much better businesses that are run by ethical, moral people."}
{"text":"Good cheap, fast-ish sandwich - reviewed as a vegetarian.  The veggie stuff is pretty good here, the ingredients are nice, and although there aren't a ton of veggie options (one, basically), what they offer is solid.  If you like Jimmy John's, I've been here many, many times and the food is always consistent.  That being said, this location loses a star because they're far slower than a few other locations I've visited.  When it's busy, they seem to move, but if the place is fairly empty (like 90% of my visits), they'll make your sandwich like they have all the time in the world.  That's cool - unless you write \"Freaky Fast\" all over your walls ;-)"}
{"text":"They always take about an hour to deliver to my house and this recent time the driver couldn't find my house and they didn't even call to let me know!!! So they were going to keep my money Not deliver my order and not call me!!! He said\" it's been about an hour so I assumed it was a prank call\" ummmm the order was paid for online!! Dumb idiot you know they aren't educated ppl"}
{"text":"Visited the store for the first time rather than delivery.  Staff was awesome, as usual, and the lass taking my order recognized me from a delivery a while back!    The subs are still yummy, they were fast and am pleased with their customer service,   Decided to finally give in and give them the 5 stars they have earned from me!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a good year because I moved to California, but Jimmy Johns is as good as it gets. I worked nearby and we ordered delivery pretty regularly and it was always really fast and DELICIOUS. Never had anything less than great service (at least at this location). I miss Jimmy Johns so much...please open a location in San Diego!"}
{"text":"I NEVER post reviews like this but this location is HORRIBLE. SOOOOOO disappointing. RUDE management, completely incompetent staff (in person, delivery and management) and no regard for customer service.  LONG STORY SHORT - I used to order from here regularly. Called to order a mid-day bite and was then told by someone that they're no longer able to deliver to my house because the last 2 drivers had difficulty finding my place. I'm within their radius...a regular customer...but a pair stoned teenage drivers can't find my friggin house so it MY fault?!?!?! How TF can you be a delivery driver and have difficulty finding places??! I mean come on...you have GOOGLE MAPS IN YOUR F'IN POCKET!!!!!! You literally have a computer IN YOUR HAND and can't find my place but I'M the one in the wrong? Ok.  Got on the phone with someone who is purportedly a manager - who sounded like Mr. Cheezle from Grandma's Boy - saying he needed his drivers to have a good vibe while they're out delivering. AND trying to find my place caused them stress and his drivers logged complaints with him...dude, I live in a condo in East Tempe. WTF?!  I'll eat JJ's again, but not from this location. DONE!"}
{"text":"I order from this location 2 times a week for my lunch. They are always on time, very quick with delivery and with all the construction that is happening on bell right now, I find this level of service to be phenomenal. Thank you so much for reliable delivery."}
{"text":"Well first time ordering from Jimmy Johns, i took advantage of on-line ordering got a tuna lettuce wrap, which was very tasty, with thinny chips, reduced fat chips, and a DR Pepper, all was very good and filling. The deilvery driver was courteous and friendly, don't normally order delivery, like to get out and get it myself, figured I'd give a delivery driver something to do, for i was a pizza delivery guy myself at one point...."}
{"text":"I have to say I love subway but after now trying the best sub I have ever had and that fastest as well this will now be my new subway, also being able to order and  pay before I come in and just walk in to a happy and cool environment and grab my food is great as well."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's gets 5 stars because they earned every one of them. They do everything right:  ~ the bread (it's the best) ~the cold-cuts (sliced on site, no low-grade Subway ingredients here!) ~lightening fast service. A nice sanny made from scratch at the blink of an eye. ~Totally affordable. My budget sub sanny is a Slim # 5 (salami & cheese) and it runs me a whopping $3.83 with tax!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years, we moved within 2.5 miles from this location because we're here every week at least.  Vegetables are always crispy fresh, they change their gloves often and wash their hands when I'm there.  They greet me with a friendly hello and it's normally the same faces.   Exceptional service for a freaky fast establishment.  Tried their Kickin' ranch for 50 cents and it's got a spicy kick for your sinuses. I used a little on my sandwich and gave the rest to a friend who enjoys spicy food."}
{"text":"If you are a human being and thus may at some point after midnight need to pee or poop, don't eat here. The restaurant is open until 3 or 4 a.m. and is quite willing to take your money and serve you food and biiiiiiiiig giant sodas, but beware...their restroom closes at midnight.   I couldn't believe that as a customer, eating in, I was not allowed to use the restroom. Is that even legal??   I asked where customers were expected to use the restroom after eating and drinking at their establishment. The girl informed me that customers can go \"next door to Fat Tuesday\".  There are 2 MAJOR issues with that: 1 - you can't get into Fat Tuesday (a bar) if you aren't 21, so late night 20 year old sandwich eaters better have big ass bladders. 2 - the line to get into Fat Tuesday is sometimes about 20 people long, then once you get carded, get inside, and navigate through the crowd, the bathroom line for the ladies room is another 10-15 long. This means if you leave Jimmy Johns in the middle of eating to pee, you must be 21+ and you will be gone for 20 minutes to an hour to take a leak next door. You can then come back to your crusty sandwich and your annoyed friends who have been babysitting your food while you went pee pee partying over at Tuesdays. Screw that.  I'll tell you right now, if I were a guy, I seriously would've pissed on their floor under my table. But...as a girl, that could be messy for me. So...lucky for you Jimmy Johns...I was born without a penis. You win the prize of no pee on your floor, but you will never win my business EVER again."}
{"text":"I tried the delivery service for the first time. I have never been inside this JJ location, but it's closest to my home so I ordered. My boyfriend made the order, which included a conversation about onions with Alyssa (I believe) that went something like this:  BF: (thinking he's just being funny & she'll understand) Can you make the Country Club extra country? And by extra country, I mean add onions? Haha. Alyssa: So...you want extra onion? BF: Oh...does it already come with onion on it? Alyssa: No. BF: Ok...well then put onion. Alyssa: Extra onion? BF: It doesn't come with onion already? Alyssa: No. BF: Ok...then just add onion...regular...not extra.  The $20 delivery of 2 sandwiches, one bag of chips, one cookie, and one drink arrived very promptly. Alyssa was the one who delivered it. BF joked & asked if the sandwich was extra country. She said she didn't know...she didn't make it.  We start eating. I take about 2-3 bites and realize I haven't tasted any onion. I open my sandwich...absolutely no onion. Good thing they had that big convo about it, huh?  I considered calling back to get it fixed but all the employees at Jimmy Johns stores seem to be high school kids that I have absolutely no doubt would spit in my food for complaining, especially 15 minutes prior to closing. I decided to give \"Feedback\" on the Jimmy Johns website instead. Using my smart phone, I wrote a small description, filled out my address, phone number, etc, etc... and finally hit \"Submit\". I got a message back that said \"Bummer...could not submit. Error 404\" or some crap. Bummer? Really???   This PLACE is a bummer. And the fact that I will not be eating there anymore...that's a bummer for them. And my sharing a crappy experience here on Yelp...yep...another bummer for them!"}
{"text":"Try freaky slow delivery.  Good food, but nothing fast about it getting to u. 56 mins Now if u make it into the store they do make them pretty fast."}
{"text":"These are tasty and satisfying sub sandwiches. I work in LV every week and take a cab to my office. There are zero food places by my office and this place delivers. The sandwiches are always tasty and they deliver fast.   I usually get the regular Italian sub with hot peppers. Super yummy.   great place for a quality sandwich. I will be ordering a delivering next Wednesday."}
{"text":"Had my first experience here yesterday, and the first thing I noticed was that everyone seemed to be enjoying their job. The folks behind the line were chatting and smiling (with each other and customers)  while working as fast as the wind! (two things you rarely see happen at the same time) Being a first timer, the fellow taking my order helped me out a bit, We went for a #5 Vito (Italian)  #9 Italian Night Club  and a Gargantuan (tons of different meats all double amount, it's 2-3 meals in one bun!)   What distinguishes JJ' to me is that everything tastes so fresh. The meats and cheese taste like they were just sliced, not sliced days before and vacuum packed.  And I know the bread at Subway is baked fresh, but this bread just tastes fresher and better. I thought I would miss the extra flavors and such subway offers but I didn't. Quality ingredients really shined through.  I had them put extra vinaigrette and hot peppers (not really that hot) to add a little depth of flavor, and it was far from over soggy, but worked out just right. Is this the best sub I've ever had in my life? Nope, but at a average of $6 apiece it's a surprise and best Bang For Buck sub I've ever had. And it IS one of the freshest tasting subs I've had in recent memory. They also will deliver just one sub, most places have a $10 minimum, how refreshing is that? As to complaints about the music, I found the music to be no louder than most places. Quieter than 5 Guys, MUCH louder than Village Inn."}
{"text":"I love jimmy johns and frequently come to this location. I was pretty disappointed that my bread was extremely stale. Otherwise a good sandwich though."}
{"text":"Never again! Charging for cheese?!?! I'm taking my $17 for two meager sandwiches to chili's! That way my kids get a full meal for that kinda money! They have 2 full meals for $20 with appetizer and drinks! Over priced subs! Maybe they should go full organic and it would be worth it, but no never eating their again for those prices!"}
{"text":"Quick and accurate. It's a great combo for a place. Sometimes it can be busy. Just wish we had more options for toppings (more veggies). Cookies are delicious!"}
{"text":"I tried to break in here. I managed to Jimmy the lock. Then I went into their Johns and did my business. Look, I need to get my jollies somehow okay. Don't judge.  Jimmy Johns doesn't make huge sandwiches, so don't expect to get stuffed to the gills from their products. I also don't think their bread is very good. But what I will say is that their ingredients are miles and miles better than Subway. This location was the first JJ I ever went to, as it's right around the corner from my friend's house. He likes these things more than me, but I have to be honest, their cold cut sandwiches are not half bad. I like the one with salami, cappicola and ham. I always ask for mustard on it, because, well, it mustard been love, but it's over now."}
{"text":"Great food. When I entered the store, it was very clean and smelled great. The staff was very nice and friendly. Sandwich was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich shop! The sandwiches are always fresh! The delivery is superfast during lunchtime! I recommend them 100%.  My favorite is the Turkey tom and the Lulu! The food is always fresh!"}
{"text":"Came in around 3pm for a number 6 with salt and vinegar chips with a water cup. Always fast always clean and their life sayings on the walls are a great read while munching on your sandwich."}
{"text":"This location finally opened! Never tried JJs before but my co-workers always talked about it. Work treat us for lunch and I'm a believer! Ingredients are fresh, order was correct, delivery was on time, only reason why I didn't give it a five star rating is because I didn't dine in to see the place."}
{"text":"Racist employees. Arguing with customers that their children are \"things\" and \"belong on a leash.\" Other people/customers see and hear the things your employees say too! Shame on ya'll."}
{"text":"Sandwich was ordered at 12:34P. Called at 1P to let them know it had not been delivered. The discussion between the employees while on the phone was that they could not find my order. They passed me to a manager but did not tell him why I was calling. He then told me \"his buddy NAMEHERE\" was out delivering three sandwiches one of which was mine. The person that finally showed up at 1:15P was not the person I was told would be delivering it. The driver that did show up was very rude when he arrived and, in his words \"is there a problem?\". I said \"yes, the sandwich was ordered at 12:34P it is now 1:15P.\". His reply \"we have other sandwiches to deliver\". This is NOT the first time I have had a problem with this store but probably the fourth or fifth time and I will NOT be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Didn't eat here. Walked in about 4:15 on 3-6, four employees counting money and talking to each other. I'm the only customer. No hello, no, I will be with you in a minute. No eye contact, I waited five minutes then walked out. Why do you have four employees?  You're wasting your money."}
{"text":"I dont know why I've never noticed it before but I actually hate their greeting as I walk in. The last thing I want to hear is a bunch of impersonal HI'S!!! or HELLO!!! as I walk in from about 10 different people.  I really don't like eating inside this specific location as it seems much louder than others I've been to in the past. I usually get my sandwhich then head next door to Five Guys and just buy a drink so I can sit and enjoy my meal in quiet.   That being said I simply love their subs. Their mayo is the best hands down and pretty much makes the sandwhich. I looked up their nutritional value online and unfortunately at 700 calories per sub it wasn't looking too great as a healthy alternative to the surrounding fast food places. Still if I'm craving a sandwhich I'd prefer Jimmy Johns over other sub sandwhich places. Subway *cough*"}
{"text":"Order a delicious sandwich today!! Super good and got here to my house within a great amount of time! Thanks jimmy johns!"}
{"text":"I ordered 3 sandwiches at 4:12 pm and did not even get my order out of the shop until 45 minutes later. The delivery was within 800 yards of the shop and the delivery man took another 20 minutes just searching for place that is incredibly easy to find.... Somehow managed to lock himself in a random building. The manager would not compensate my order for the hassle so I had to cancel my purchase an hour after my original order just to be reimbursed for their mistake. Very poor business practice."}
{"text":"Went to Jimmy Johns for the first time for a quick lunch.  Wanted a #9, but asked if I could have the dressing on the side as I couldn't eat the whole sandwich in one sitting and didn't want it to get soggy.  Trey informed me that they couldn't do that. I asked if they had a small cup to put the dressing in and he said no. My husband lifted a water cup (the stack was right in front of Trey), and asked if they couldn't use that.  Trey said they could do that,but not without first giving me a glaring look that said he was feeling very put out. I can't count the number of restaurants in this vicinity (including Subways), and, even though the sandwich was decent enough, I don't want to return to a place that makes me feel like I am bothering them with my business.  I also thought it was odd that they did not cut the sandwich in half, and when I asked them to do so, again, they seemed surprised by my request as though I was supposed to eat a 9\" sub in one piece."}
{"text":"Sub was pretty good, nothing special or gourmet, but still good. I had the \"Giant\" italian sub that seemed pretty standard to me. It was supposed to have double the meat and judging by the name  I guess i was expecting  little more than a standard 8\" average - meated sub. My problem wasnt with the food, I was with the rude little punk at the register. I had never been there and was a little confused about the ordering system and he treated me like I was stupid, and a few minutes later when i asked for the sauce on the side he stated they dont do that and then proceeded to ignore me when I began to ask another question. I definitely wont be back, especially to this location."}
{"text":"Great bread!   Nice people,  fast service.  Very comfortable place to eat.  Their low fat chips suck but everything else is awesome.  I like it much better than subway.."}
{"text":"Walked in for lunch at 2pm, waited at the counter and not a single employee spoke. 6 behind the counter and 2 drivers in white shirts standing at the counter with me, and NO one spoke, I walked out."}
{"text":"Most of the Jimmy John's I going to not really good service subs are pretty OK. Today I went into the one on McKellips in Mesa, 4401 E. McKellips and the service was great and my sub was delicious."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this jimmy Johns twice. I workin less than 300 yards from this location. The building is large with hundreds of employees that order delivery from this location daily. Both times I order it takes over 20-30 minutes. Today when I called to find out what was taking so long all I got was a half assed apology. He said the delivery guy had just walked out and would be there any second, it took another 5 minutes. Because he walked. But a sorry makes it all better. Don't order from this location, they don't care nor are they freaky fast."}
{"text":"I come here once a week with my cousin for lunch, and it is awesome. I always order the Italian Nightclub. Delicious! I've had several other sandwiches here, but that's my favorite (all are excellent). What I specifically love about this place is that it live up to its motto. They say they are fast, and they ARE. You order, and as you fill your drink, the sandwich is in your hands. Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"I've been kinda slacking on reviews lately, so I figured why not kill two birds with one stone and get an FTR as my 100th review!  This Jimmy John's location is brand new and located on the SE the corner of Craig & Jones. If you're familiar with the area, the shopping center also has a Panda Express, Dunkin' Donuts and a few other shops. The JJ's is on the far east part of the complex in a newly renovated building, and as of right now they are the only business open in that building.   The inside of this JJ's is quite a bit different from other locations I've been into. Like most of the other stores, they have the open kitchen area, but this JJ's has a pretty big open dining area as well. When you walk in, you'll find a few booths to your right hand side and some community, bar style seating on your left. One of the coolest things about this location is they've also got a drive-thru!   I've always been a fan of JJ's and the sandwiches at this new location were just as good as any other one I've been too. I prefer their thick sliced 7-grain bread over the French bread and it was super fresh. Their meat has great flavor, I love that they use real bacon and I was even more excited to see they offer sprouts at this location. Not sure what it is, but some fresh sprouts really set off a sandwich. Other traditional toppings like lettuce, tomato and cucumber were all fresh and tasty. The only big complaint I have food wise is that they only offer Dijon mustard, so if you prefer yellow mustard, you'll be getting packets on the side.  I have eaten here twice since they opened, both of which were pickup orders. It's great they offer online ordering and if you have a group of people or want to order for the office, they have a really nice group ordering system. On my first order, they messed up a sandwich and forget ingredients, not a huge deal but a bit of bummer. When you order, everything is broken down and printed so how they managed to mess up is beyond me. The second order was perfect though and they seem to be doing just fine for having only been open less then a week. I'll definitely be a repeat customer and this is a great location so I imagine they'll do really well here."}
{"text":"I like this place because you get your subs super fast and they're good for the most part too! I feel like the quality is better than Subway. I always order the Vito because I love Italian subs. However, if you want the meatier, thicker sub, I would go for the NightClub sub, because it's essentially the same, just with more meat and toppings. I've tried the tuna sub, which is good if you like classic tuna subs. Nothing special, just a good ol' tuna sub sandwich. I wouldn't go in with the expectations of classic Deli subs from New York/Chicago. If you want subs better than Subway though and want it done really quickly, then go here, you won't be disappointed. Oh, and one more thing... the sizes of the subs are all one length - longer than a 6 inch but not quite a foot long.  I think the hype is all in the atmosphere. Being in Surprise, AZ which is on top of Sun City, I doubt the loud rock music flies well with some of the clientele. I even heard some of the customers complain that the music is too loud. The manager explained that part of the JJ's chain's personality is the loud rock music. It keeps the atmosphere light and upbeat, along with their funny signs, rules, and sayings. The workers behind the counter even yell out and greet you the second you open the doors to enter the restaurant. This place is just so convenient for what it is. It's easy to get to, plenty of parking, and they even deliver 1 sandwich if that's all you order. Overall, I can say that I really like this place, which explains why that the staff I work with hits this place up at least once a week."}
{"text":"Big fan of Jimmy John's. Glad to see it in my neighborhood. Have loved the veggie#13 sandwich in other cities for some  time. I'm very disappointed that the wheat bread which is a significant part of the#13 experience has  been consistently dry to stale at the Carson street location.  I've tried different days and times but always the same sad result."}
{"text":"I know this location has been open for a while now, but let me start out my review by saying that my co-workers and I were PUMPED when we heard that JJ was opening up across from our office!  Since then, I've visited many many times, and I love how solid JJ is.  You know it's going to be fast and delicious every time. Even if there is a long line, you get through pretty quickly.  The cashiers are helpful too!  There's plenty of seating inside and out.  JJ chips are super delicious too, so don't make the same mistake I just made, add them to your order!  Lastly, I love the building this location is in, the Union Trust Building, thankfully it's undergoing renovations and will be back to it's old glory very soon.  There is scaffolding in front of JJ but don't let that deter you, it's no big deal."}
{"text":"So if I could give this place no stars I would. I order from here often and I've never had an issue until today. My sandwich got delivered on time, but when I opened up my bag with my name on it(from the printed receipt from the store) the sandwich was incorrect. The sandwich I received did not look appetizing at all, it also did not help that I was looking forward to the sandwich I ordered. I called the store and let them know about the mistake and they said they would replace it and deliver the correct sandwich but they needed the incorrect one returned and I said that is fine. I left the sandwich up front with our office assistant and waited, waited, and waited some more. My lunch time came and went and the replacement sandwich never came. I called again and a girl answered, not the male I had spoken to before. I was transferred to the male again ( never gave his name) and I told him I had received my replacement sandwich and he replied with \" and your not going to receive it, it's not our fault that you guys messed up the order\" I then asked for a refund instead since my lunchtime had passed and I said I'm sorry but I grabbed the bag with my name on it ( with the store provided receipt)and I expected my order to be correct inside. He responded with more blame towards me saying I grabbed the incorrect bag, I told him that I was not an idiot and he then responded \"You can get your refund from corporate, I am not giving you a refund\" and hung up on me. I called back and he answered again( did not give his name again), I asked him to give me the number to corporate and he said don't you know how to look things up on the website and hung up on me again. I called back again, and someone picked up the phone and hung it up. My number must have come out on caller ID and they didn't want to deal with me. I did find the corporate phone number and called and they let me know they couldn't give me a refund because that store is independently owned and the store had to do the refund. The customer service rep did make a report and was going to send it to the proper people. These Jimmy John \"employees\" need to learn customer service skills! I will never order from here again, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Fast, efficent sandwich making here. Not much as far as \"service\", cashier took order and moved me along. Minute later I was out the door. Works for me."}
{"text":"I am so glad to hear this place closed down. This place needed the health inspector to go through, especially after ppl in my lunch meeting got sick after eating here. They never got my order correct the first time, the employees never seemed to know was going on or care."}
{"text":"FRIENDLY STAFF  PHENOMENAL SUB SANDWICHES  SUPER SCARY FAST SANDWICH MAKING   If you don't love Jimmy John's, then you obviously have no taste-buds, and you clearly don't appreciate fast and friendly service. You must be an alien."}
{"text":"Terrible with order accuracy and timing. Usual wait at tops an hour...not as advertised and sub par service."}
{"text":"Great quality food.. Tastes great and doesn't take long to get at all.. Nice service and fun environment. Very clean and kid friendly.. Definitely will not be going to subway ever again."}
{"text":"great sandwiches.  fast...really fast service.  fast delivery. good prices."}
{"text":"fast sandwiches. delicious sandwiches.  delivery is faster than one would think possible, teleportation technology must be real!"}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is fast. So fast that they forgot to put sprouts on my tuna sandwich. Considering that was the primary reason I got said tuna salad sandwich, I'm pretty bummed. The tuna salad itself is chunk light tuna, not even whole albacore, and has a pretty fishy taste to it.  I'll give 'em another try, and hopefully bump this review up another star."}
{"text":"Manny the delivery boy was the best! I had never gotten jimmy johns but he made the experience good apon my lack of knowledge"}
{"text":"I really like Jimmy Johns. This location in particular. I think they make their bread better than any other location in town. Where I live is a little outside their delivery zone but I unde that and because his location has a drive thru it makes ordering their freaky fastness even faster.  The inside of the restaurant has always been spotless when I go in, and if it isn't, there is usually a staff member right around the corner ready to clean up. It's very well lit and usually a pretty good temperature considering they have a huge oven in the kitchen. The music they play can get a little loud but simply ask them to turn it down and they will. They have booths, high top tables and regular low top tables.   The staff there is always incredible, I never see any of them just standing around. They are either cleaning or making bread or making sandwiches or answering phones or taking deliveries or working the drive thru window or front register. You can tell that the mangers have the workers motivated to keep working.  From someone who has had every sandwich on the menu at least once (even the ones on the secret menu) I can definitely say that my favorites are: 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, and 17 and the gargantuan. They used to have a sandwich called the double gutbusta which is 2 gargantuans on one piece of bread but don't have it anymore. You can make a double gutbusta by getting a gar and adding meats but that gets expensive. One time I got a double gutbusta with 10 strips of bacon and 2 scoops of tuna.....it was huge. Speaking of the tuna, although I don't care for their tuna sandwiches other than the slim 3 I reall enjoy putting tuna on random sandwiches sometimes just to be different. The other slim I like is the slim bacon. 5 strips of bacon on their bread. Also, if you don't really like French the wheat bread and lettuce wrap unwind style are pretty good. Prices are borderline, if you are gonna go I would suggest getting a club sandwich, it's worth the $7.03.  The cookies, chips, pickles, drinks. They are all pretty good and good value. I'd say if you get a drink in the drive thru ask for ez ice. I like the chocolate chunk cookie. I don't eat the oatmeal raisin because I believe I ate the best one they ever had so I don't wanna ruin that. I really like the bbq and thinny chips.  What I really like about JJs is they never said they had the best food, just that they would get it to you fast. I would recommend this place for a quick lunch or on the road eat."}
{"text":"My husband was always going on and on about how much he loved Jimmy John's and how it was so great when we lived in Michigan and blah blah blah...I sort of tuned him out thinking yeah, whatever when am I ever going to eat there??  THEN we moved to Charlotte and there it was like a glowing beacon in the night, his eyes lit up like Christmas morning and in we went.  He ordered the Vito which is an Italian sub and I ordered the Pepe which is just ham and cheese with lettuce and tomato.  My God, it was amazing.  Something about the bread, or the meat, or something made it one of the best subs I've ever had.  It was quick too!  We were in and out in 5 minutes and sat outside to enjoy our lunch.  It is at least a once a week stop for me now!"}
{"text":"The subs are very good, fresh vegs, quality meats and soft rolls.  The best part?  I have never been there.  That's right, never.  You see, they deliver and deliver FAST!  You can order online or by phone."}
{"text":"THE rudest employees that do not care if you get your order correct or not. Avoid this place!!!"}
{"text":"I usually resort to jimmy Johns for a standard but not not particularly amazing sandwich when I'm too lazy to leave my house.  They almost always get my order right and deliver in a timely manner.  I am one block out of their delivery range and in the past I've had zero problems. They are always nice and deliver it anyway and often don't even mention that I am slightly out of range.  The manager got on the phone today and was unnecessarily rude when telling me I'm out of range. I know I am, but it hasn't been a problem before. \"Other people may have said yes in the past but I'm the manager and I'm saying no\".  I didn't argue and was not rude in tone so I did not appreciate the lack of customer service at all.    Postmates forever!"}
{"text":"Buyer beware  No place to sit and eat so all is take out or delivered so your not close when your order is wrong, very low quantities on sandwiches and not even what I ordered And pickle was not even cut  This location does not live up to other jimmy Johns locations  And with reading others posts they don't care"}
{"text":"I work at the Family Video down the street from this location and my employees and I order quite regularly. The staff is normally nice and the delivery guys are always great. I ordered a sandwich for lunch per usual today and when I received it I thought I was missing an item I paid for. I called back and the girl on the phone got very snippy and rude with me about it. It was just a misunderstanding but she could have been a lot nicer about it. Very displeased with her customer service skills."}
{"text":"The good: sandwich was delicious, reasonably priced. Standard stuff for Jimmy John's.  The bad: ordered my sandwich and got no questions about what I wanted on it. Had to make sure to tell them to add sprouts, shouldn't they ask if it's an option? As soon as I paid I looked at the other ingredients and asked if they could add hot peppers. At the same time they handed me my sandwich. Great that it only took 30 seconds to make, but... They refused to give me a side of hot peppers. Said they would have to charge me for the side.  To do it free, they would have to unwrap my sandwich, add the peppers, and give it back to me. It's the same amount of peppers, why not just put them in a cup???    Also, there are no napkins to be found anywhere. They don't give you one with your sandwich even if you say you're eating at the restaurant. Had to ask where to find them and they are hidden behind the counter. They made me reach behind the counter to grab some. Why not just have a napkin dispenser by the condiments like every other restaurant in America?  The sandwich was good, but the way they put it together made all of the meat slide out the backend. I don't know if it's the fact that they put too much mayonnaise on the bread, or something else. But it's annoying to constantly have to hold the ingredients in the sandwich while you're eating to avoid them squirting out under the table.  I'm sure that I will be back because the location and food is reasonable. But I will certainly think twice and consider other options after that experience."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with #6 light mayo, cut in half.  Fast, friendly, I'm in"}
{"text":"Normally always love Jimmi Johns, but the last time I had #7 and the bread was hard, not as good as it normally is, Just dispointed because I know they can do way better..  I will continue to go back, hopefully that was just a bad day,"}
{"text":"I love me some Jimmy Johns..... It is my favorite of the chain sub shops. If there is a Jimmy Johns around, I will never go to a subway. I always get the same thing... Italian Night Club, no tomatoes, no mayo, add hot peppers, cut in half. It never disappoints. This shop has to also compete with Carson Street Deli which is amazing. If I need something super fast, or looking to spend a little less money, this is the spot. I do wish they delivered about a mile away to Mt. Washington though. I would order them way more often.... Their potato chips are also amazing. Kettle cooked, thick, crispy. I usually go with the plain or Jalapeno."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's and their consistent fast service. I wish we had this chain in California.   I always order the Hunter's Club (1/4 pound of medium rare roast beef, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo on Jimmy John's signature fresh-baked bread) with chili peppers on the side. Sometimes, I get half a pickle too! Their bread is delicious and made to perfection. Not really sure what they put in it but it's super delicious. I came in today and I was in and out with no problems. My sandwich is delicious!"}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's sub rolls. They are the best. My only complaint? If you special order anything you might be disappointed. My husband always asks to have his sandwich cut in half and it almost always comes whole. Last time I ordered avocado on my sandwich, paid an extra 75 cents for it and honestly it looked like they had put it on and scraped it back off. That's how little there was on the sandwich. Very disappointing. Still, their sandwiches do taste great."}
{"text":"I read some unhappy reviews about this place and I honestly have no idea what their talking about. Maybe it was just bad timing on their part, but I have eaten here multiple times and each time I'm very satisfied. My sandwich has always been ready for me almost immediately after paying and if I ate in the staff would always double check with me to make sure the food was satisfactory. I would definitely eat here again, in fact I actually plan on it..."}
{"text":"I give them three stars only because as a famous Sub place you would expect bigger subs or more toppings for the price. Other than that complaint I think their food is great and I am a fan of the bread. I believe it is the perfect slight crispness while being soft and had a flavor that balances the sandwich. If they also had some sort of soup on their menu I would be here every day eating a sandwich and a soup.  Also their iced tea spoils after standing in a hot car for two days. Weird..."}
{"text":"Service was quick, staff was smiley and very friendly. Sandwich is delish! I just moved to area and JJ is my fav sub shop so I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints for a quick and affordable sandwich. Always on point with any adjustments to an order."}
{"text":"You've lost a customer and business who has used you many, many times for catering. Came in to order 14 sandwiches and told no! Said I had to order the day before. There's no sign, no mention on the web, etc that states this.  Horrible customer service and will not be back to this location of any other. So glad Firehouse Subs is close and would recommend Jersey Mikes over this poor establishment."}
{"text":"OK, I really like the convienence of sandwiches delivered right to my office.  JJ's had been very consistant and delivered good food.  Unfortunately the quality of the food has gone the same way as most chain sandwich shops.  We've been super busy, I needed to order out twice this week.  TUESDAY: Ordered a club sandwich with extra meat.  No extra meat.  Ok one miss, not too bad.  THURSDAY :  Ordered a tuna salad sandwich, onions extra. Opened the wrapper and I got tomatoes, cucumbers,  extra mayo and all of the water they should have drained off the tuna.  Bread was soaked, dissolving into this gooey mayo colored pile of gloop.   Time to quit JJ's like Subway, Quiznos, Port of Subs and all the others before."}
{"text":"Picked up a turkey Tom with all the freebies - my exact words. The cashier noted my order wrong and my sandwich was bland and didn't taste good. I called immediately and the manager didn't seem to really care. He tried to blow it off as only one freebie was missing but I had to read off the menu what was missing. He offered to make a new sandwich but refused to deliver it even when I said I didn't have a way to come pick it up. He also offered to send me a free sandwich card but that would only work at that location which was useless because I was visiting. Finally he offered a refund.  Poor service and unreliable."}
{"text":"\"Freaky Fast\" and \"Subs so fast you'll Freak\" That's their corporate slogan, keep that in mind. Ordered online. The order confirmation e-mail after I pay in full now reads 45 minutes ago. Just got my sub.  I am ok with everything mentioned above. Things happen. Ingredients, drivers, maybe accidents even (hopefully not), but when I called 35 minutes into the order I got no explanation over the phone. If your entire slogan is based off of speed, at the very least apologize over the phone when I call and ask why my sub is 35 minutes late. No apology, monotone voice, no reason for why, just \"it's on the way\". Great thanks.   Only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the guy who delivered it was very polite both over the phone when he called to say he was downstairs and in person."}
{"text":"First experience with a JJ's an was impressed with the speed of the sandwich making process if nothing else. The sandwich was on par with some of the better I've had elsewhere, maybe not as good as Lenny's but better than Subway."}
{"text":"I've been hearing so much about this place so I gave up subway for a day and tried it. The subs were amazing, bread tasted fresh, service was fast, I was in and out in less than 5 min during busy lunch hour. Only complaint is the mayo, the slap it on pretty heavy so ask for it light"}
{"text":"Second time I've been here and Ordered 'The Vito' sandwich was half ass made with no lettuce when I asked for extra. I also asked for additional dressing they rolled their eyes. When I received sandwich they still didn't give me anything I asked for. Customer service was terrible will never go back!"}
{"text":"How it's happened that I've heard about Jimmy John's over and over again and am just now actually experiencing it, is beyond me. However, I like to say that sometimes it's better late than never and although I'm late to Jimmy's game, I'm glad I showed up before it was too late.   Jimmy John's is a great lunch option when hungry for a sandwich that's fresh and I would believe, not incredibly fatty. It's not the place I would choose for a leisurely lunch, but it is a place I would choose for a decent sandwich while I'm on the go.   I enjoyed reading the different sandwich names and opted for the beach sandwich. I like to take advantage of anything beach-related so that I can pretend I'm on a little vacation in the middle of the day. The sandwich was on a white roll with turkey, avocado spread, lettuce, tomato, provolone and mayo. I went mayo-less and added mustard instead. The sandwich was filling but didn't stuff me and it didn't make me slip into a food coma.   Sadly there isn't a Jimmy John's that's incredibly close to me, so I will just have to wait until the next time I'm in a Jimmy John area. Unless they in fact would like to move into the Old Town neighborhood. We could use one!"}
{"text":"I miss Jimmy John's badly, its basically the only grub I remember from my college years in the Midwest.  Its all about the #9 aka Italian Night Club.  Fingers crossed, someday this will open up in LA!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 1 club @ 8:30pm fri.nite. got home.bread was stale & hard as a stone rock. Almost broke a tooth. How dare you sell me stale crap...threw away the bread, the meat was good and fresh though... employess are always super nice though!"}
{"text":"Terrific sandwich, customer service was good but I have been to others store that were much faster than this store, that was my only issue, just a little slow.  Super nice though"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat at but, the last few times we have dined there the quality of our sandwiches was really poor. It was even busy and they were made very poorly with mayo all over the bread on the outside and it was lacking Turkey bacon and the cucumbers we had asked for  When you are spending almost 8 dollars for a sandwich it shouldn't be just bread. We are very disappointed in the quality of our sandwiches."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Do not order a tuna sandwich. If you do the staff will be vocal in shaming you of your food choice."}
{"text":"Good, quick, straight forward sandwich shop that also delivers to my work place! I actually just walked around the block to them though this time to place my order. I never get away from the Vito sandwich at Jimmy John's, recently however I have been ordering a pickle on the side with my sammy. Those things are addictive though so be cautious!"}
{"text":"Always fast and affordable. By far the best service of any sub place. Takes me back to my younger days in college. Yum!"}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich with no tomatoes and it was delivered with tomatoes.  I called in to have them remake and resend it, spoke with Manager Larry Walters.  He said he would remake and resend it, no problem.  10 minutes later it shows up and its the wrong sandwich.  I called back and have never had such a horrible customer service experience.  Instead of trying to solve the problem, Larry was more interested in arguing with me and trying to \"prove he was right.\"  Numerous times I asked if he was going to remake my sandwich and he just kept arguing with me and asking \"well where is your reciept.\"  I've left feedback on their website and am anxiously waiting for a response back."}
{"text":"Normally good, today it's terrible. When I placed my order, the girl seemed bored, sleepy and uninterested, not to mention practically inaudible. When I got my food, it was screwed up- no extra mayo, and I wanted peppers on the side but they put them in the sandwich. When I told them they did, the guy who made it said \"no, there are no peppers in that sandwich.\" I had to bring it over and ask him what they were, to which he replies \"peppers.\"  Still, 3 stars since the other 3 times I've come here its been great."}
{"text":"They say their delivery is freaky fast. Their drive thru is craaaaaazy impossible fast! You wouldn't believe it until you experienced it!"}
{"text":"OMG what a joke... really, this is hillarious...so here we go. So our first time = one and DONE A deranged woman works there.   She said there's a Tasty Sauce on the tuna sandwich. As we asked what it tastes like, she said she can't tell us because \"you can't really taste.it.\" Is it cream based? Oil based? Butter based even?, I ask.  \"Not any base, she says.\" Is it salty, sweet, vinegary? I hint on...  \"wehhllll,\" she hem and haws.  \"It's like ORIENTAL,\" she says. So, I\"m an Asian  woman. Not really caring that much, I jokingly reply, \"you mean Asian?\" The woman obviously loves hearing herself talk because she didn't get my obvious crack regarding her choice of words.    Could this go from funny (Haha) to funny (she is a mental case)? Oi! So much more odd and ridiculous sentences about how we shoukd know why tuna sandwiches are so awesome. But let's get to the best part. We receive our order and she says \"let me tell you why you shouldn't order the BLT sandwiches (it's what we ordered and she just finished making for us). I quickly said \"No please don't, because we're about to eat them.\" She pushes to want to tell us, still. \"No, you're gonna want to know why!\" I couldn't believe my ears. I put my hand up and insisted \"No! We really don't want to know! About the BLT's that we craved for through this ridiculous ordeal? We really  shouldn't have walked through their doors. Jimmy John's is Jimmy Gone!"}
{"text":"So I went here earlier this week for lunch. I ordered the Big John I believe that was the name. Anyhow, it came with lettuce, tomatoes,  mayo and roast beef.  First things first the good: Compared to Subway the bread had a better texture. It wasn't overly hard or too soft...just right in my opinion. The roast beef tasted pretty good! It actually tasted as if it could be a decent quality beef...but what do I know, this was my 2nd or 3rd time eating roast beef. The vegetables on the sub were nice and firm, and not so overpowering that they made my sandwich soggy.  The bad: For the size of the sub (8inch) it would've been better if they'd filled the open spaces with more meat or toppings. The sandwich seemed a bit naked and skimpy.   The ugly: So this is the one thing that actually made me question their superiority to Subway. THE TASTE OF THE BREAD! Okay, so if Subway uses rubber in their bread, what is it that these guys use?! I can't explain the taste except if I tasted my hair relaxer, I'm pretty certain that would be it :-/ It had such a chemical like je ne sais quoi.  Whew...so after it's all said and done...I say get your sub at Fry's haha okay half joking...umm well save a cow and start eating salad,  :-) that is all"}
{"text":"Hottest JJ staff ever! I mean seriously, everyone I saw working here was totally cute, crazy! Must be the proximity to the college?   Anyways.. the cute staff makes one deliciously awesome sandwich.  Me being the big eater that I am I went right for the money shot ordering the J.J. Gargantuan. Its the biggest sandwich on the menu! Loaded with genoa salami, ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey & provolone, its for the meat lover and not for the faint (or weak) of heart. Its so thick that you might be hard pressed to get this monster into your mouth. Somehow I managed though I've had years of practice eating thick sandwiches. If you also grabbed a bag of their BBQ potato chips you can add a sweet, smokey crunch to every bite of your monster sammie. Yes I do mean pry the buns apart and cram some crushed potato chips in there. Nom!  Now that's a cute sandwich!"}
{"text":"Love this Jimmy johns. I've never had a problem here. Fast and friendly. Love how the workers are always friendly. I've gotten deliveries from this place and the night driver always comes freaky fast. Love the freaky fast bike jersey."}
{"text":"The staff are always extremely rude. They don't deliver 2 miles away. They never answer their phone. Today they got mad at my husband that we ordered 4 Vito's. My husband asked for a bag to carry the sandwiches and was charged $1.50 for the bag! I don't know what is wrong with this location but this will be the last time we go here. Terrible service and they honestly should be shut down."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the service is fast. Enjoyed the Vito and the JJBLT. Fresh ingredients and a nice soft sub bun.  The 8 inch is the perfect size for me. Not much seating space. However I prefer to do take out and enjoy at home."}
{"text":"First time ever going to a Jimmy Johns. The service was quick and friendly. I decided to try their veggie sub. Competitor vegggie subs are usually bland. This was not the case here, i really enjoyed it and the prices were fair."}
{"text":"I'm only giving two stars because of the entire brand, and their bread and mayonnaise consistently taste good, HOWEVER, the service here is deplorable. I believe I have ordered three times from this location, and all three times it's taken over 45 minutes to receive my order. That's just not acceptable who's companies motto is \"freaky fast\" When I lived in another city, I ordered from the local jimmy johns frequently and I would get my order in 10 minutes or less, so I know the standard. Furthermore, the most recent time I ordered, about 45 minutes had passed, so I called to check on my order, and they answered the phone \"hello\" I had to ask \"is this jimmy johns?\" It was just bizarre. I think when people order jimmy Johns, a lot of the time is because they want their food fast, so if that's your reasoning, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We were frequent customers when this location first opened but stopped because they kept screwing up our order . Nothing like getting home to find your order is incorrect. Today I stopped in to try again and they screwed up again i.e., mustard missing, peppers on wrong sandwich! Guys get it together...there is too much competition in your immediate area and more coming. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I don't see what all the hype is about this place. I like Subway way better. Jimmy John's doesn't have spinach or green bell pepper toppings like Subway does, for one reason."}
{"text":"So disappointed!  Gone twice now,  & still felt hungry. ..Their sandwiches are small. SUBWAY is better!"}
{"text":"I just order slim number 4 and I asked for pepper on the site. They refused to sell me pepper in the side or inside my sandwich because of corporate rules. I can't believe I can not order and pay extra for pepper to enjoy my sandwich. I will never go back to Jimmy Johns. So disappointed"}
{"text":"This jimmy johns specifically I love going to because the service is \"freaky fast\" like always but at this location they are extremely happy and genuine and they make my day"}
{"text":"Even though this place is usually packed, they have their lunch rush down to the tee. By the time I am done paying for my order, within a couple minutes it's ready for me to pick up. I usually just stick to ordering a sandwich because the add-on's tend to get a bit expensive for me. I love their italian sandwich. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"$5 sub, that was plain. I had to ask for mustard... Doesn't that usually come in a sandwich? Also, it said on the menu, cucumbers... False advertising, much. Their bathroom was clean, and decorated funny, though."}
{"text":"Had Jimmy John's for lunch today for a company lunch.    Something about the bread and the mayonnaise that makes me want to just keep on eating.  I sampled the following delicious sandwiches: #2 Big John - Roast beef, lettuce, tomato & mayo. #3 Totally Tuna - Tuna, sprouts, cucumber, lettuce & tomato. #4 Turkey Tom - Turkey breast, alfalfa sprouts, lettuce, tomato & mayo.  These are very tasty , I especially LOVE alfalfa sprouts!    The only down side is that even after eating lunch, I still feel hungry. :(  I've had Jimmy John's a few times before over the last year and I have come to the same conclusion - still hungry."}
{"text":"Need a quick-fix, tasty meal that will sit like a brick in your stomach for hours? Yup, Jimmy John's is right up your alley.   My very first JJ's experience was when I was living in the Coventry area and...well I'm pretty sure you know where this story is going. After the bars close you have a choice of pizza from Guys (which is also good) or a sub. There's just something about a sandwich longer than your forearm that sounds delish at 3:30am. I can't explain it.   Soon thereafter, Jimmy John's started to leak into my \"next-day-hangover-meals\" and it wasn't long before it was part of my regular-day lunch options. I guess you never know how good something is until you eat it sober in the daylight (i.e. Taco Bell).   Well, JJ's is mad tasty and always hits the spot if you're craving a hearty lunch. The bread is my favorite part of their sandwiches, with the guacamole coming in close second. I actually wouldn't be surprised if there was some sort of addictive serum they put in their bread.  It's that good.   I've never had a bad sandwich or any sort of mix-up with JJohn's, ever. This particular location is a beeotch to find parking around, but the staff is always friendly and super accommodating. Just this last time we were there, they gave us a free cookie out of nowhere. That's how awesome they are.   By the way, often times people think that just because the ingredients are fresh, what you're eating is healthy. Welp...I hate to burst your bubble, but the Veggie Club is the most fattening/calorie-filled item on the menu. The Beach Club is my favorite sandwich to get and it's still pretty bad. So, I guess just keep in mind that if you're taking a trip to Jimmy John's, it's not necessarily going to be the healthiest lunch option you could have picked."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Jimmy Johns I have ever been to. Loud music, the girl taking your order can't even hear what you are ordering. No one seems to know what is going on behind the counter, and half the time your order is screwed up. This shop definitely needs some help, or the employees need to stop hitting the sweet leaf before work."}
{"text":"Vito sub. Excellent prices very quick and tasty, if your in a hurry for lunch this would be a quick stop."}
{"text":"Rude service.  When I asked about why their delivery area was so small (I live 8 minutes away), the employee said \"We don't care.\"   They probably put the same effort into the stuff they call food.  I would avoid this place. It would not surprise me if the employees were doing nasty things to the food before serving it."}
{"text":"They have messed up two of my online orders now. This time I didn't ask for it to be re-delivered, but I called to speak to a manager to at least let them know. I mean I would want to know that my employees can't read. He didn't give two s***ts about it and didn't even apologize. Sorry goes a long way, but by the look at these other reviews, these guys just do not care. Lost my business."}
{"text":"First time at a Jimmy John's ever. I know it's getting a lot of buzz, but I don't get it. It reminded me of a more upscale Subway. But While both provide fast service, I would not describe either one as delicious. Or would go out of my way to find a Jimmy John's. I need more cowbell but not JJ's."}
{"text":"I usually order delivery and I get exactly what I order, but today I ordered deliver for my boyfriend & i and his \"totally tuna\" was given to him as an original \"vegetarian\". I order a vegetarian every time add roast beef & sprouts. Mine came out perfect, but we were disappointed that his sandwich wasn't even close to what her ordered. This time it's 3 stars, always double check before you deliver!"}
{"text":"They ALWAYS get my order wrong. I'm vegetarian and I can't tell you HOW many times I've had to come back because there was meat on my sandwich or it was a completely different sandwich than what I ordered. I always check before I leave now, having to open the whole sandwich up, just in case. My trust is super thin at this Jimmy Johns. I'll stick to my boyfriends side of town. They always make sure my (very simple) order is right and I leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Been here twice...i know its a simple sub...but the blt i had both times was really good!"}
{"text":"We live less than 2 miles and they don't deliver to us. No wonder they have \"fast delivery\" with such a limited delivery zone."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns places an emphasis on speed. They make your sandwich really quick. They deliver your sandwiches really quick. Even their radio commercials are really quick.  However, this culture of super-fast service has one weakness. They will mess up your order once in a while. My friend ordered a tuna sandwich. I clearly heard him say tuna. My friend clearly heard himself say tuna. I'm sure the cashier clearly heard him say tuna.  Instead of a tuna sandwich, Jimmy Johns gave us a Beach Club instead.  Come on! (I hope you liked the Arrested Development reference.)  Overall, I wish that management would place more focus on speed AND accuracy. It's not the first time that Jimmy Johns has messed up on an order. If you are allergic or your children are allergic to any ingredients that they serve here, I would not recommend Jimmy Johns. There's a good chance that they won't make your order correctly.  (p.s. The food was great. The staff was friendly. The prices are great. The location was clean.)"}
{"text":"If I wanted to sit and eat with the music blaring I would have went to a bar or dance club. Hey, do you ever wonder why the place is empty? I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Always lightning fast and friendly. Much better service than other sub shops in this area, and the bread is always fresh."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst locations there is in town.  I am a JJ fanatatic!!!  The manager is rude and obnoxious, when you try to talk to the person working the register she talks over them and interrupts as if she is a dictator. The staff looks her direction before they speak or answer a question even if its something so simple as how is your day.They are ALWAYS out of wheat bread, even when I can see bread in the container she says sorry I cant....? Then gives a BS explanation of how they have to conform to standards. WTF? I dont care if one slice is 6 times bigger or thicker than the other just make the damn sandwich.......at least once a week I have to go to another location. What happened to the customer is always right? I will drive the 25 min to the one on lake mead just for the experience. The staff there rocks, always fast friendly polite and professional. They know what I order and have it made as I am walking in,and have just the right touch, sandwich is always perfect with right proportions and never ever out of wheat bread EVER. I go here at least 4 times a week."}
{"text":"These guys are hella quick. Ordered my sandwich over the phone less than 10 minutes it was in my hand. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Ehh, three stars because of delivery and fast service. If you have to work on the weekend (thanks boss) and you want a place to deliver, you're shit outta luck in downtown. Soooo Jimmy John's to the rescue (somewhat) and your food is delivered with pretty quick timing...   As far as the food goes - I felt like I was eating a sandwich from home. I ordered the Tuna. It was decent, but the bread was terrible. It's french bread, which is hard to chew and without any kind of flavor. The tuna had cheese, cucumbers, and celery on top, so I added avocado for an extra kick... and I didn't get my kick.  Not eating here again."}
{"text":"I went there today, after picking up my lawn mower from the service behind the plaza. My father and I said \"meh\" let's go.   The inside in nice on the eyes Menu is semi confusing - not hard to understand, but there is a sandwich called the \"J.J gargantuan\" and has no description of size for being almost $10.00 - actual price is I believe $8.49.   We ordered the sam which called the \"Vito\". They were right, they are FREAKY FAST! Hahaha. BUT the sandwich is mediocre at best. The bread is blan and plain. There was almost NO MEAT on sandwich. There was probably 5 - thin - slices, and a bit of cheese. The taste really was nothing special.   I haven't had them deliver before, would like to try the JJ and have them deliver it.   I would MUCH rather goto \"Pizza booyah\" in Willoughby- which is owned, operated, and have menu items from the \"What About Bobs\". Their sandwiches are STUFFED with meat, and unbelievable tasting. I DO NOT WORK FOR THAT  COMPANY / RESTAURANT.   I say don't waste the money, but feel free to try jimmy johns your self.   Very nice workers as well, and clean."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Jimmy John's, but this location has consistently been the worst I've been to. I went in person about a month or so ago and the odor inside the store was overwhelming and smelled like bleach combined with something unidentifiable. We had to take our sandwiches out of the store halfway through our lunch and eat them in the car because the smell was so strong and gross. I also received a gift card and had a turkey sandwich (#4, no lettuce) delivered to my house today. The sandwich did arrive quickly, which was awesome, but it was two thin slices of turkey and four small, thin slices of tomato. I actually opened the sandwich to see if they forgot to add the filling because the sandwich looked empty when I unwrapped it. It was like eating a bread and mayo sandwich with tough (old?) bread. I have been ordering from this store since it opened, but I also order from two other locations when I'm working. The other locations are significantly better! This one seems to be getting worse. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Today was one of those days where I look in the fridge at my frozen dinners.. Then I look in the cabinets at my cans of soup... and say f*ck it. I'm going to try something new.  Enter Jimmy Johns. In GA, they just recently started opening shops, but none of them where near enough to where I lived and worked for me to actually try it.  First off, the website is awesome. Their nutrition calculator lets you choose the toppings, add/subtract things from the sandwich, and even choose a lettuce wrap instead of bread. It gives you the complete nutrition info, instead of just calories. Yay! I got the country club unwich (lettuce wrap) with turkey and ham, and sat patiently waiting for the delivery boy. The delivery time said somewhere between 11 and 11:30; the boy showed up at 11:02. Nice! The sandwich was delicious, despite it's lack of bread, and super healthy.. because of the lack of bread.  Oh, and it's cheap! 6.50 for the sandwich, plus whatever yout tip.  Will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for sandwiches before our hike. Semi busy, not slammed but not dead. From ordering to getting my meal it was 5-6 minutes. They are very fast here.  Ordered two sandwiches both with no tomatoes due to allergies. Paid a good Price and both meals were made right. At check out I forgot how good their oatmeal raisin cookies are. So I grabbed three! After packing the meal up and driving to red rock and going for a long hike, the sandwiches stayed very fresh and in place while in a backpack. Not messy to eat at all especially in the mountains.  Normal service there. Nothing over the top. If you are driving by I would grab a Sammy because their bread is amazing. It's not going to break your wallet either."}
{"text":"I hate to admit it, but I love Jimmy John's!  Not only are they the fastest meal in town,  but the make a solid sub!  Make sure they put \"Sauce\" on your sub, it's delicious!  If you haven't tried them, they are faster than they say.  I am not kidding, when I order a sandwich to be delivered, it is at my office within 5 minutes!  Give em a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I really like this JJs because they get our order right every time. Fresh, friendly and freaky fast. They only get a 4/5 because of delivery boundaries. JJs should really consider expanding their delivery boundaries."}
{"text":"Emmaculatly clean restaurant, cheap prices, excellent service, and very pleasant environment. While corporation doesn't give a military discount, it's obvious that the employees support our troops. The sandwiches were exquisitely made in the matter of seconds. We couldn't of asked for a better time.   Greg, Max, Joe, and Cody were friendly and efficient. They were also happy to provide us with anything we needed for the perfect casual dining experience."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I placed an order online for delivery. After about 20 minutes I started to wonder why it hadn't been delivered yet because this is not their M.O. Well the driver called me a phone and was basically screaming at me. Telling me I didn't provide the right address. I said excuse me but I am standing on my porch with my light on and certainly know my address. I see no one driving by. He got upset and said he was outside walking around and my home doesn't exist. Then hung up. Shortly after I see him pull up to my house. The result of the story was that he was on the wrong street. He kind of threw my food at me, abrubtly handed me the credit card slip to sign it. This punk was maybe 20 years old and certainly doesn't belong in this line of work. Then the cherry on top was that my sub was not made properly AT ALL. I asked for onions and hot peppers on my sub, to which I got neither. If I want to be treated like crap from some delivery driver, I would expect that my order be atleast right. I will not patronize a place that can't get my order right and treats their customers like this."}
{"text":"Always LOVE Jimmy Johns!  sandwiches the way i order, delivery quick & staff always friendly!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich place!!! Sorry subway, quiznos & port of subs! Jj is a winner in my book! My favs are totally tuna, the Italian, & the gargantuan!! So close to my house too!"}
{"text":"Super slow delivery, rude and unprofessional on the phone- overall horrible experience all 3 times. Done ordering from here altogether"}
{"text":"HIT THE SPOT!! Late night dinner for me and a couple of my daughters!! We ordered online and it was here in only 15 minutes! So much better than greasy pizza!! The 3 subs were made to perfection and hit the spot!! A young man delivered them with a smile and it was perfect for a low key Saturday night!"}
{"text":"I work at a prominent hotel in uptown Charlotte and we ordered on 2/26/17 for our entire staff to show them appreciation for their help during CIAA basketball weekend. We called at 10:30am to place an order. After an hour wait we called with an update on our order and the man I believe he was the manager said that the lady was already out for the delivery. Another hour passed now it was 1:30pm so we called back to see what's going on. The man said that they don't know what happened and that they haven't even begun to make the food yet. This was outrageous. So we asked to speak with the manager. The manager got on the phone and  had no care in the world about our order and how long we've been waiting. He said and I quote \"well it's been a little busy\". He did not offer us anything for our troubles of waiting almost THREE HOURS for our food, our employees had held off on most of their lunch breaks because of this.We all thought the food would be here around lunch time. Like I said we ordered at 10:30am and didn't even get a response after an hour wait called back TWICE and the final time they said they haven't even began making the food yet! We will not be conducting business with this sandwich shop ever again. I usually love Jimmy Johns but this one in downtown has to worse customer service I've ever experienced. I expected a lot more from this establishment."}
{"text":"I'm in the service industry and overall a patient person. Delivery went out at 12:20, 25 mins later it said it was delivered. I waited and no sandwich, I called and no concern or care was expressed. I made it to the store and back in lunch traffic in 20 minutes (freakishly fast) when I got home the delivery driver was outside. So overall it took over an hour and paying for delivery fees and I tipped the driver and I ended up having to go and get it myself. No one apologized to me or even seemed to care, I had to ask if I could atleast have a bag of Chips for the inconvenience and he didn't even answer me. Needless to say I'm disappointed, had they said we're experiencing longer wait times i wouldn't have been upset but it's the fact that no one even cared. Bummer."}
{"text":"The food quality and taste is on par with all other Jimmy Johns locations, which I find to be quite delicious!  Way better than Subway in my preference book.   However, their advertising team promotes \"freaky fast\" delivery service. I order regularly (and will continue to do so) but my average wait time is 30-45 minutes.  Their food quality/taste gets them two stars, but since they don't deliver on their marketing promises I cannot go any higher with the rating.   I know many have complained because they are beyond the delivery radius, which is supposed to be 2 miles (it seems from the comments and feedback from friends they actually don't seem to cover beyond 1.5 miles).   Not sure what the problems are here, but hopefully they will sort them out soon, or stop marketing as a freak fast delivery service."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's!  This affair actually began in college, I lived up the street from one.  You have to ask for their home made wheat bread (it automatically comes on white).  Even though this place is a chain and their decor is really cheesy, I had to write a review because I literally woke up drooling for a #12 because I ate one in my dream last night....it's true. They have these amazing hot peppers that I want to buy a jar of.  It's the only sandwich I have ever ate that doesn't need hot sauce."}
{"text":"Its about time they opened up a Jimmy John's on the south side!  Located right off Eastern and Windmill this spot is brand new. Its a lot bigger than the other ones in town but the food and decor is pretty much the same. If you haven't been to a Jimmy Johns before, picture long skinny 8in french bread subs, standard sammich ingredients + chips and cookies. No soups or salad and about $4-7 per sub.   The service at this location was surprisingly slow when I came in. JJ prides themselves on making sandwiches really fast (I don't really think thats anything to brag about though...) But it took much longer than I expected to get my sandwich and they weren't even that busy. I am sure its probably because its a new location and my beach club was perfect anyways. On a site note this is the first Jimmy Johns I have seen with a drive thru which is nice if you're feeling lazy."}
{"text":"This location across from campus was the first Jimmy Johns I ever step foot in. I was excited for a new sandwich spot close to UNLV and I was not disappointed. Unlike most sub spots, Jimmy only offers standard sandwiches, chips and cookies. No soups, no toasted subs, no pizzas or whatever else Scumway is putting out.  JJ's standard sandwich is a 9in sub (also available on sliced whole wheat bread) with an assortment of meats, cheese, and topping. You can build your own if you want but the menu focuses on some of their proven specialties. I'm a big fan of the beach club: double portion of turkey, avocado and provolone, the bootlegger club is also pretty good. At about ~$6 a pop, the sammiches are decently priced but can easily turn into a $10+ meal if you throw in chips and a drink.   This location is pretty cool, its a much older building and the restaurant is very narrow. They were able to put the dining room up in the attic which is interesting. As always with the other locations JJ delivers for an added fee making is very convenient for study sessions at Club Lied."}
{"text":"I see no reason to ever eat here again.   They add *nothing* to the eating scene anywhere and in fact tremendously detract from it.   Because of this place, I'm going to have to add to my list of \"Signs You Need to Eat Somewhere Else.\"     Rule:  If there are photographs of the food on the wall at an American restaurant you're probably in the wrong place.   To be sure, the quality of the photography will be inversely proportional to the quality of the food.  If the guy's son made it with a point and shoot, stay.  If there was a contract to Industrial Light and Magic, as must have been the case here, leave immediately.    Rule:  The number of registered trademarks you encounter  is inversely proportional to how long you should stay.  Jimmy John's has like 17 trademarks on their name alone.  The joke must be on them--their lawyers have conned them into spending a fortune to protect a concept nobody in their right mind would ever steal.    I poured over their menu before deciding on the Bootlegger Club.  Maybe I was hoping with a name like that it might border on the cutting edge, maybe it'd be so good it'd be illegal.    I told them what I wanted.  I said \"everything but onions\" twice and listed the specific ingredients twice.  Yes, I did want oregano.  That's five times now.    The sandwich was the biggest culinary disappointment in recent memory.  If you're wondering how they sell sandwiches for cheap, it's by putting nothing on them that's worth anything.    I'm looking at the picture of a sandwich on the wall while I attempt to figure out what the hell I got.  This isn't just McDonald's dressing up a shellacked hunk of ceramic for their marketing--Jimmy John's is a blatant lie.  The sandwich on the wall was overflowing with meat.  Mine was overflowing with iceberg lettuce.  The wall sandwich had many slices of meat, mine had about two.      The *only* thing that had any flavor in my sandwich was the spartan accompaniment of mustard.    When I ate it, I was missing Yaz Deli, the immigrant/family-run standby  when I worked in the same building.  He got all his shit from Costco and put together a meal with four times the value this place ever could.  That guy spoke a hundred words of English but never once remotely fucked up my order like I got here.    I was missing Subway, and I didn't know that was possible.  Subway wouldn't have been the waste of money Jimmy John's is.    I might have even justified my single star because this place does keep many people employed, two that were extremely good looking.  It's overflowing with attitude and Gourmet and instructions to enjoy myself, but I just cannot fathom how I am supposed to.  There are far better potential uses of the space it occupies in the building.  It's not worth the sales-tax revenue to a cash-strapped city.  It is a travesty that it occupies such a significant corner downtown.  Your money should be spent elsewhere.   \"Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted.\"   read a sign on the wall.  I will let all the ironic volumes of bullshit in that speak for itself.    -2 out of 10."}
{"text":"Road Trip Notable Nosh #7 (See Lists)  Although this is a chain, I've never been to a Jimmy John's before, and have to say, I much prefer it to our other on-the-road staple Subway.  In many parts of France and Belgium, they serve the most amazing sandwiches on thin, foot long baguettes, with freshly baked bread and quality, not overflowing ingredients... at rest stops and train stations!    This place reminded me of those sandwiches.  We got the Italian \"sub\" and a tuna salad with cucumbers.    The tuna sandwich was amazing.  I don't know if it was the dressing for the fish, the fresh, thinly sliced cucumbers, or the chewy dense bread.    We also got gourmet BBQ chips and salt and vinegar chips.  The crunch paired nicely with the flavorful bites of sandwich.    For a quick lunch, I am definitely on the look-out for this chain near our new home in LA!"}
{"text":"An overdue review. Other Jimmy Johns locations I have been to put this one to shame. It's super busy, takes forever to order, service is fast but you get a sloppy sandwich that has everything falling out. It's clean just a little too crowded at times."}
{"text":"This place is the best! They are the fastest and most courteous folks in the business.  Great job!   I have been ordering from them over the past two years and they remain consistent with their service and quality of food. Their breads are always fresh and chips and pickles are always crunchy. Not to forget their chocolate chip cookies mmmmmmmm!  JJ makes it so easy to order and they deliver so fast making it ever so convenient to not have to be burdened with leaving my office and dealing with the traffic.  Thank you Jimmy John's..."}
{"text":"Sooo disappointed. It's 8pm and the store doesn't close till 9 yet the rude lady there barely acknowledged our presence then rudely told us that they only have cold stuff. It's an hour till f'n close but they were running around closing everything down. She said \"Quiznos is near by\". WOW!"}
{"text":"I love the bread, its got this great chewyness to it. They don't lie about being fast either, everytime I've been they have my food ready before I finish paying."}
{"text":"The guy that made my sandwich wore the same gloves he was using to clean, wipe his hands on his shirt, and put on his apron with to make my sandwich. I was speechless. I threw my sandwich away as soon as I walked out. I like Jimmy John's but I will never go to this one again! I wish they had a no star option on this app. So fucking gross. Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought the whole point of wearing gloves was to keep the food clean and sanitary. This guy effectively destroyed that argument."}
{"text":"I've never had bad service here and I actually enjoy eating here for lunch because the only wait is the line. My sandwich is always ready within 2-4 minutes of when I order it.   I like the staff cause they always seem to be in a good mood and they normally play good rock/alternative music. Although, one day they were playing that annoying Friday song by Rebecca Black and some teeny pop crap... manager must have been out that day. Whatever, food was still good!"}
{"text":"Solid sandwiches in less than 2.5 minutes.  The fresh bread is delicious and the workers are super cordial.  One minor piece of advice: the BLT is just okay, with bacon from a freezer bag.  Otherwise, work your way around the menu for fair & reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service.  Manager was super rude. I found a hair in my sandwich and am completely grossed out. My girlfriends sandwich was wrong. I asked to have hers remade and mine just refunded.  Got nothing but attitude, very disappointing. We ended up asking for both refunded and to come back and pick up the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Although my #12 sandwich tasted good, I was extremely disappointed and upset that I couldn't get a side of their peppers.  I wanted to see how spicy they were, and the response I got from the kid at the register was, \"we have nothing to put them in.\" This was total BS since there where empty water cups sitting right by the register, and there are always napkins.  I emailed customer service and the response I got was, \"Jimmy chooses not to do items on the side. This slows down our sandwich line and enables us to provide that freaky fast experience that our customers know and love us for.\"  IT ONLY TAKES 2 SECONDS TO GRAB SOME PEPPERS!  What is funny is this place is always empty and has 10 employees working at all times.  I think customer service should come first, and I wouldn't mind waiting an extra minute to get my sandwich if it meant getting exactly what I wanted."}
{"text":"Always fast. Always good. $9.00 with delivery fee for just a sandwich kind of sucks but it is what it is."}
{"text":"Fastest delivery time you have ever seen. The Italian Nite club and their Tuna sandwich are always their best. I work in the area and its hard to get food delivered in a timely manner. They are always reliable."}
{"text":"I've heard some people really rave about this place. They were so excited went Jimmy John's came to the valley. My review is based on a single experienced but it was definitely sub par.   Am I the only one that has had a need for napkins or extra condiments? With the 7, count 'em, 7 kids in the sandwich preparation area and maybe 3 customers I was confused why when my girlfriend asked for napkins at the register, the girl told her they were at the other end.....literally like 5 feet away. So we walked 5 feet down and asked a different girl standing there and received napkins.  Went outside, sat down and realized there wasn't mustard on my sandwich. Went back inside and asked for some, \"We don't have any.\" Yeah they don't have any salt, pepper, mayo, mustard or any self serve condiments. You have to get those things when it's being made. Weak.   The bread was fresh, everything was really, but it was no where near an amazing sandwich. I'll probably try it out again but at least I'll know what I'm getting, an okay sandwich."}
{"text":"Love the subs here.   Bread is soft and fresh, rather thin - not too much bread, not too little. Lots of traditional options (tuna, roast beef, ham) but the veggie is the real star, with cucumber, sprouts, avocado. I'm in love with this sandwich.  I've been to a few different Jimmy's and always found the service to be fast and friendly. The decor is cute, kind of spunky 50's. I think you can also buy day-old bread to take home for a low price."}
{"text":"Even the fast food guys need some love. The ingredients are fresh, the bread is soft, and they are the speed demons of sandwich making! No kidding. By the time you find a seat and fill your drink, your sandwich is ready for pick-up. Perfect for that once in awhile lunch treat. Personally, I would take a JJ over Subway, any day."}
{"text":"Decided to cater lunch for some former coworkers while visiting Las Vegas. since this one was the closest to my former place of work  I chose this one for delivery. I made the order before they opened and noticed the receipt said \"pickup\". I called when they opened to inquire about delivery but was informed that their drivers are on bikes therefore couldn't deliver by \"the manager\" as she referred to herself. That was disappointing but was fine I told them I'd pick it up.  I was out meeting with family, since I was only in town for 24 hours on business, and figured I'd go after. I was less than a block away from picking up the order when I got a call from their condescending young manager rudely asking when I was picking up the order \"because it's been done for an hour and sitting\". I was in such shock as to how she was speaking to me, even my friend in the car heard (because of Bluetooth) and couldn't believe How rude she was.  Mind you, it was only about 11:00 am , just an hour after they opened. Clearly since I was assuming they could deliver via car like almost every other jimmy John it wouldn't be a problem to get it delivered so I started  running errands and was on the other end of town.  The manager , who was clearly very proud of her title, likely realized how rude she was & tried to recant and say \"I just wanted to know if I should put it in the fridge\". First off, why wasn't my order already in the fridge considering some of The sandwiches were Tuna?!\" I now live in Arizona and work at a law office down town and I use jimmy Johns a lot because of their delicious bread , fast delivery & customer service.  Thank goodness a different standard has been set out here because if this was my first experience I'd never use them again! This occurred on 11/18/2016 about 11:00am ."}
{"text":"The store is clean, the staff are very respectful, and my order is always ready extremely quickly. I want to shout out to ChiChi for taking my order super fast. The commercials for freaky fast talkers is nothing compared to how fast ChiChi speaks. But what was equally fast was how quick Lovely got my order done. I think I walked in and walked out in less than 3 minutes!! I didn't even hand my money to ChiChi before my sandwich was ready."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and  I am seriously unimpressed. The services was unhelpful and the food was bland. The store was clean, that's about the best thing. Oh and I kinda liked the pickle"}
{"text":"The food was fresh, no doubt about that. After biting into my sub, all I could taste was freshness and crispness. The selection is not as good as Subway's though, and any extra addition onto your sandwich costs more."}
{"text":"My last visit here, one of the guys behind the counter smelled really bad. They put my sandwiches up on the counter but didn't say anything to anybody, AND they left their dust pan and broom propped up on the soda fountains. Maybe the boss was away that day or something."}
{"text":"Great subs, if they ask you if you want whole grain, it's an actual sandwich (boring), not a sub, so stick with the French bread if you are looking for a sub. They didn't tell me that when I ordered, I thought it was like Subway, where a sub with whole grain is still a sub. The sandwich was delivered and was just okay, but not what I wanted, lesson learned for next time. Fast delivery just like the commercials.I used to get the Italian Vito with extra meat, lettuce, oil and vinegar, and tomatoes, tastes great :).  I have started to eat less to lose weight, now I order the Vito with extra tomatoes and extra lettuce. When you ask for extra vegetables they don't charge any more (score!) and the sandwich feels fuller and fresher. They only charge for extra cheese and meats."}
{"text":"Love jimmy Johns.  Staff was quick and made everything perfect this first time.  I also had the opportunity to meet the owner, great guy, made sure everything was up to my standards."}
{"text":"Same as a few other reviews on here. I love their sandwiches but they are ridiculous about the delivery area. He told me it stopped a half mile from my house and refused to deliver to me. Take my money damn it! I want a bootlegger!"}
{"text":"Freaky Fast is an understatement. I literally had my sandwich before I was done signing the credit card slip. I didn't realize the guy making sandwiches behind the counter was listening when I placed my order and when my sandwich came up, I seriously thought it was for someone who ordered long before me. The three of us in our party were definitely impressed! My sandwich was not only out quickly, it was delicious. They offer self service fountain beverages and also serve fresh brewed iced tea. There is plenty of seating both indoors and out. I am definitely a fan and will return."}
{"text":"This location wasn't nearly as fast as the new location downtown. However, they were busy cranking out orders for delivery that had been called in.   I ordered the Bootlegger Club and was disappointed to learn that they didn't have banana peppers to add to my sandwich. She did offer cherry peppers, which were decent, but definitely not the same. She asked if I wanted cheese, to which I replied \"American.\" Apparently they don't have American cheese, so I opted for provolone.   All in all the sandwich was ok, but the bread was a little chewy. Only three stars on this visit, but I will return and give it another shot, and update the review if the experience warrants and update."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Great food as always, but  I will not be supporting this location. Girl at the counter very rude, wouldnt talk at all, only when she needed money. Never smiled. Also the employees that served us failed to mention they no longer use sprouts, we had to ask about it when we noticed they were missing. Very cheap and skimped out on giving spreads, like avocado, dijon, etc. other locations are better at this.  I usually give places the benefit of the doubt, but trust me, this was bad.  Do yourself a favor and go enjoy at a different location."}
{"text":"Insanely fast, better bread than Subway and they'll deliver one sandwich. One! I've had zero problems at this location with the food and service. Only drawback is too small of a parking lot."}
{"text":"If you're going to take an order set the right expectations, jimmy johns famed \"freaky fast delivery\" is not well represented by this location."}
{"text":"Your inability to deliver to San tropez apartments on Hayden and Thomas is quite pathetic considering the 2 mile distance. Used to order subs from you all the time and will not be doing so going forward. Lost a customer."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 sandwiches. 1 turkey with cheese and 1 veggie with sprouts. Guy at register says ok no problem. He shouts order to the guy making em...1 turkey with cheese and a veggie. I'm like hey man you got sprouts on that right. And he says no we don't have sprouts. I'm confused cause he said no problem when he accepted my order but now they don't have sprouts. Don't advertise sprouts and take orders for sprouts if u don't have em. Had I known they didn't have sprouts I would have gone to a different location. Just say no Jimmy Johns.  Edit: I will not return to this location even if Armageddon comes and it's the only place left in the Vegas Valley to eat."}
{"text":"I purposely sought out a Jimmy Johns near where we were staying because I'd heard about the place and they aren't yet in San Diego where I live.  I'd heard that the sandwiches come up freaky fast, which was true - ours were ready very soon after we paid.  The bread was great, and everything tasted really fresh.  Pretty good sandwich, but while I'd put my first Jimmy Johns visit well above a typical Subway experience (at a competitive pricepoint), a couple of my pet peeves were triggered.  First, I prefer nationally branded chips.  The chips at Jimmy Johns are all self-branded.  The jalapeño chips were good, but I would have preferred fritos instead.  Second, I counted ten employees behind the counter, which was odd for such a small place that wasn't all that busy.  I know Jimmy Johns delivers so maybe some of these kids were waiting for delivery orders.  Lastly, and most importantly, the ratio of sandwich contents to sandwich bread was off.  This being my first time, I didn't realize there is a bigger \"club\" version of each \"sub\", with twice the meat and cheese.  I ordered the #1 Pepe sub (ham and provolone w/ LTM), but I should have ordered the corresponding #7 Gourmet Smoked Ham Club.  My sandwich was great but the picture on the website and menu made it look like it my sub would be FULL of meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato...  Mine was much, shall we say, thinner than I expected from the photos.  I'll definitely go back, and I liked the sandwich, but JJ needs to be more true to life with their photos.  Next time I'll get the club for 2x the meat."}
{"text":"There's no warrant for labeling these sandwiches \"gourmet.\"  There's no fancy mustard, no snooty ingredients like fennel, orange chutney, or aubergine, and no organic/vegan/gluten-free menu.  These are just nice sandwiches made as fast as humanly possible.  I ordered and continue to order (hey, I'm a man of habit) the Italian Night Club which is, to my understanding, just every italian sounding cold cut on a bun with shredded lettuce, onion, tomatoe, mayo, oil and vinegar.  Everything's always fresh and it's not too pricey.  Good enough for me."}
{"text":"They delivered my sandwich without a key ingredient (and without asking if that was okay). When I bit into it, the tomatoes were so clearly bad that it made my stomach turn. Even after I removed them I couldn't eat it, because the bad tomato juice had gotten on everything.  UPDATE: I was starving after the gym, so I caved and tried them again. What a mistake! They forgot an item, didn't include a straw for my drink or napkins, took 37 minutes (not by any means \"freaky fast\"), and didn't have a pen for me to sign, but insisted on awkwardly waiting in my doorway while I searched for a pen. No thanks. Not again."}
{"text":"GM refused to deliver to us even though they've done it before. I hate that kind of inconsistency."}
{"text":"Only thing I ever get here is the #17. The food is decent for what it is and the cookies rock.  The bad part is that they have had my order wrong at least 3 times. They need to train before putting them on the line, sucks to get 6 miles back to work and have the wrong order."}
{"text":"Thanks to your recent price increases for delivery orders due to \"minimum wage increases\" i will no longer support or purchase from you again. I do not get a raise to make up the difference. I work at a big company who orders often and i have let the employees at my work know. Good luck this has pissed numerous people off!"}
{"text":"For a sub shop, great place.  Delivery is freaky fast for sure.  I order delivery half the time.  Pro's - fast delivery - quick service if ordering onsite - staff friendly - food is good  Con's - No WiFi.  Would like since AT&T service spotty near this building.    Good spot.  Glad there is a location here."}
{"text":"Tonight, I ordered delivery at 8pm. Giving them the benefit of the doubt that this location was busy, I waited for about an hour until I called to check on my order. They forgot to make it. They asked if I still wanted my sandwiches and of course I said yes. The guy on the phone offered to credit me for the sandwiches, but said he would deliver. So I stupidly waited again. No sandwiches.  This is not the first time I have had delivery issues from this store. Never again."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is the digital camera of sandwich shops - it's truly instant gradification!   I love Jimmy Johns.  My love affair started when I would venture to the one on coventry for some post bar food, and now has moved to mid day - when other human beings are up and functioning - enjoyment.  Any time of the day the sandwiches are great.   Yes, they can be bad for you, but you can go to their website and switch up toppings/options and it shows you the nutrition facts - so you can make a healthy Jimmy Johns sandwich!   I order them to my office with co-workers at least once a week - stellar sandwichs that are made wicked fast!"}
{"text":"Very smooth experience. Great food and kind and helpful employees! Dining area was adequately clean for fast food. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good sandwich place, but the founder is such a pig and I choose to go elsewhere.  Anywhere else."}
{"text":"Food is so so (average for Jimmy John's). Service is fast and employees are friendly. It is always so cold inside, so I cannot ever eat there."}
{"text":"While Jimmy John's is fast, I just don't think their sandwiches are that great sadly. I've tried multiple sandwiches from the menu but haven't liked any of them. I've heard of multiple people getting food poisoning from the food here too."}
{"text":"Okay, gave them a second try and I'm afraid it wasn't much better this time around.  This time I ate it right away (a short drive back to work, less than 10 minutes) rather than refrigerating it like last time.  Still with the stale bread...what gives?  Can someone tell me if the bread is supposed to be a hard crust-style bread or if it's supposed to be soft?  The end that was not cut was super hard--crunchy like a cracker.  What a huge turn-off.  I got a Vito this time, hoping to salvage my last experience.  Again, still not much in the way of flavor except for the onions.  I would have figured the salami would have contributed flavor-wise...not so much.  Pretty much I ended up with a stale onion sub.  Ugh.  Jimmy John, I'm sorry but I'm so not impressed."}
{"text":"It's Jimmy John's... every time I've been to this location they're fast, the orders are made correctly and it's clean. I have no issues here and continue to eat here. :)"}
{"text":"Fast and easy but don't get me wrong the quality was great and it was so good! I got the vegetarian sub prob the best sub without meat I've ever had. There was a lot of customers inside and still they got done speedy fast. They live up to their name!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the speed, taste, and atmosphere of this place.   I don't always eat cold sandwiches, but when I do, I eat Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"I went to Jimmy John's at the Galleria for the first time. As others have said, they are really quick. My order was ready by the time I finished paying for it. I got a roast beef sub and an Italian sub (with the optional 15 cent peppers). They were OK, but not great. Just your average sandwich on an average roll. I do recommend the peppers, though. They gave a little pop to the Italian sub. Still looking for a really good take-out sandwich shop in the Matthews area."}
{"text":"We live live right down the street, and get delivery often! They are \"freakishly fast\" always under 10 mins! The staff is amazing, because our sandwiches are always prefect!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero I would. First they couldn't get my order correct. She asked three times. Went to pick it up and no numbers on all sandwiches. Had to go back. Got home one sub ,tuna had NO TUNA only extra mayo and peppers. Now we are in the process of moving and I got a ride there as they don't deliver two streets south of their area. Ok no problem. I was blocked in by moving van when one of the movers told me about his sandwich. I immediately called only to be told by THE MANAGER OF this location. Nothing we can do about this we don't deliver that far. TWO BLOCKS FROM CUTOFF. THEN HE wanted my receipt to give me a credit. I paid cash plus WE WERE IN PROCESS OF MOVING. I WAS BLOCKED IN. THE MOVER WAS HUNGRY. I PAID FOR A SANDWICH NOT BREAD ONLY. I have been in retail 25 years and believe me there are exceptions to every rule. WE CANT DRIVE THEY SET OUR BOUNDAIRES. REALLY. I myself have driven from my store to a customers home to make it right. This was the worse customer service I have ever received .  The manager did NOTHING TO HELP. I would never recommend this place. If you have a problem Do not expect this manager to do anything to help you. He keeps asking where is your receipt , what do you want me to do?? I told him what I needed he did NOTHING.   I was left with paying a lot for a huge sandwich of bread , lettuce and peppers. And one hungry mover. RIDICULOUS MANAGEMENT SKILLS.  DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"I was there during the peak lunch rush and my gosh, I was impressed by how quickly they got everyone ordered, fed and back to their daily grind!  Their prices were really low for such quality deli sandwiches. The bread was nice and fresh, as were the deli slices and veggies. Definitely try this location!"}
{"text":"Went to place my order online, it asked me to put in my address. It paired me up with this location to deliver. I placed the order and waited for a confermtion (Which came in 45  minutes after the order was placed) and it stated the order would be ready for PICK UP so I calle down to the store and they told me I was out of their delivery range, even though I am a mile away..."}
{"text":"Very good subs, good quality meats. Very clean restaurant, including the bathrooms. Staff is very helpful and nice.  I highly recommend this restaurant and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So fast and always friendly staff. Love their delivery to my work-Keep up the great work guys!!! Love wheat bread they make...and I don't feel bad about splurging on this treat weekly.  Honestly I have a cafeteria in my building that cannot make sandwiches as fast or better tasting than Jimmy Johns!  I always get my order delivered freaky fast and they know me when I call. Please tip those delivery guys. They work so hard!"}
{"text":"They are awesome! They always deliver my food right away to me and it has always been correct. It's especially convenient to order online when I get super busy at work and don't have time to go out and get a meal."}
{"text":"I've never ordered JJ's before, but today I was very hungry for lunch & decided to order online from this location, since I have a baby at home and live less than 2 miles away. Needless to say I was waiting over 50 minutes for my order before I called and cancelled my order. Who knows how long it would have taken. I also made sure to wait until after the lunch rush around 1:30 to place the order. No time estimate, all it said was it would be ready as soon as possible. Will not be ordering from here again. So much for \"freaky fast\" service."}
{"text":"I go there a few days a week for lunch. Good food, usually super fast. They remember my \"usual\" sandwich. Music is usually pretty loud, but it fits with the energy level."}
{"text":"I've been a longtime customer of Jimmy John's across various Midwest states, and rarely do I have a bad experience.  That being said, this particular location seems very inconsistent with quality. Delivery was quick, and the delivery guy wasn't rude (but also not what I would classify as friendly), but the taste left me disappointed. I ordered a veg sub and the avocado spread was WAY too salty. I ended up having to scrape it off just to salvage the rest of my mediocre meal. An hour after eating, I was ridiculously thirsty and remained so for most of the night.  Also ordered an unwich for my dining companion, and the lettuce wrapped around his other sandwich ingredients was wilted and not that fresh.  Thankfully there are other Jimmy John's in the area that I can turn to for (hopefully) better taste."}
{"text":"A+ on the delivery time! Sandwich was delivered in less than 15 min, incredible. You can expect more business from me :)"}
{"text":"Speed I like. Friendly staff. Sandwiches need a little more work, but this place is decent if you are in a hurry. Nice little outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"Freaky fast delivery? My food arrived 28 minutes after I placed my order and I live 0.6 miles away from the restaurant. I used to get my food anywhere from 7 to 11 minutes when they first opened this location. Now, the food arrives sometime between 20 and 25 minutes. After this last delivery, I will not be ordering from them anymore."}
{"text":"The food was good.  We ordered our normal sandwiches; a #4 with no onion and a #5 with cheese.  However, the quality of service was lacking pretty bad.  Wasn't greeted when I walked in despite the guy at the register standing there staring at me.  I said \"Hi\" and nothing.  I was an awkward moment, to say the least.  We had placed our order to go.  When they called my order, the guy put the two sandwiches on the counter and started doing other tasks.  I kindly said, \"Do you have a bag?'  He literally pointed to them saying, \"They're right there\", then went about his other business.  Not even acknowledging that he probably should have placed them in a bag since the order was to go.  Same thing with napkins.  I've been to far better JJ's before.  Hopefully, this is just an isolated incident."}
{"text":"Used to be 5 stars.  But lately they've been slacking. They never cut my sandwich in half like I request in the order but the last order was the worst.  I ordered a sandwich before closing (which I've done plenty of times before).  It takes 2 minutes to make the sandwich and 5 minutes to get here if that.  I've timed it before.  So this time I order and 5 minutes goes by.  Then 10. Then 20. 30 minutes later I go online to check my order and loe and behold it's been cancelled! But it's not the fact that they've cancelled it that upsets me, it's the fact that they didn't have the decency to call me or email me or anything!  They just cancelled it and that was that.   UPDATE: The manager personally came to me and explained the situation about their entire system being down and he tried to contact me.  Very nice to see."}
{"text":"Love jimmy johns!!!! One of my favorite sandwich places. They always make the sandwiches fast fresh and fabulous. All their employees are very nice and polite. As many times as I have been coming here I have never had a problem. One thing I would change is there delivery policy!!! I wish they could deliver to my house I would have them come all the time lol."}
{"text":"Jimmy johns was always my favorite sandwich shop, but lately their bread has been extremely hard. I stay away from toasted bread because it cuts the roof of my mouth. So I guess I'll be switching back to Firehouse subs. Sad."}
{"text":"Fast, quick, reliable, and same taste throughout other Jimmy Johns. Quick fix if you're really hungry late at night. This location is closest to me and is pretty good. Service was good. Nothing to complain about. Good parking lot size outside."}
{"text":"Came in this evening and ordered an Italian sandwich on a lettuce wrap to go. I told the cashier no tomatoes, no mayo, &  I wanted the peppers. When I got home I unwrapped the wrap and it was smothered in mayo, had tomatoes on it, &  it was missing the Italian dressing and peppers. When I called to speak to the manager he was extremely rude &  inconsiderate. He told me that I couldn't receive a refund, &  that I needed to bring the sandwich back. Not wanting to drive all the way back I told him I couldn't do that. He told me I shouldn't have come in so close to closing time. I will Never return to this location."}
{"text":"nom nom nom! this place has really great sandwiches. although not having gluten free bread is ok because they have any sandwich you would like in a lettuce wrap. I love the beach sandwich it is super delish."}
{"text":"Just got a prank phone call from this location saying I ordered food and didn't. I have no clue how they received my phone number... When speaking to the girl manager she called me a bitch and hung up on me when I asked for her name. I must say...  Her \"name\" matches her personality."}
{"text":"My son love's Subway, I am not a fan of them or sandwiches really.  We compromise on JJ.  There is nothing fabulous about this place, in fact I think they are quite pricey.  Veggie selection is limited, everything pretty much costs extra.  It is better than Subway.  They are fast, they are friendly and the store is always clean."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the menu.   The meal was just not great at all especially for the prices.   Doubt I will go back when there are so many other awesome places like: Goodcents European Bakery etc"}
{"text":"First time in a JJ. I asked the guy what he would order... It was the Gargantuan.   I ordered as is no onion. it was ready before i left the register.   It was huge, good and hit the spot. Enough for two for sure.   The best part was the staff. The actually were cleaning when no one was ordering. I mean wiping every inch of the place. I appreciated that."}
{"text":"Never order delivery from here. It's been 45 minutes, and I'm still waiting. Half mile away. So much for freaky fast. More like disappointingly slow."}
{"text":"Freaky fast delivery! I ordered my sandwich on my Jimmy John's app which was fast to begin with. Then the order came within about ten minutes. Exactly like how I ordered it. The guy even came on a bike! So delicious and tasted so fresh. Worth every penny. Download the app!"}
{"text":"All I wanted was a side of sprouts. I had just spent $30.00 on sandwiches. I was still in the store (with the sandwiches in a bag in my hands) when I remembered that I was supposed to put sprouts in one of the sandwiches. So I asked  (very politely) if I couple have a side of sprouts. I was informed that this was not possible. Not POSSIBLE?  They didn't have to have a little cup to put it in; they could have just wrapped the sprouts in the middle of a piece of paper and  I would have been happy. When  I asked why I couldn't have the side of sprouts, I was informed that it was company policy to put the toppings ONLY on sandwiches, not given out individually. I have gotten sides in every sandwich place I've ever been to. Which is why I'll be going to those other places to buy my sandwich next time. WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE THIS  HARD?"}
{"text":"I tried to add hot peppers to my sandwich. I know the employee that took my order heard me because he repeated it and it showed up on the computer, but the person that made my sandwich did not add the hot peppers. I know this isn't life or death or even that big of a deal but my sandwich I received was not what I wanted. It was not busy at all and I wish they had better communication with each other. The employees didn't talk to each other in a friendly or professional way and this just kind of bothered me also."}
{"text":"I was just served a drink with mold in it. I would never have known if I didn't drink the whole thing then dump the leftover ice. Disgusted, I brought the empty cup back to them, still with mold chunks on the inside of the cup. The manager said he would refund. Then I watched him walk back to the drink machine, talk to another guy who shook his head no, and he came back and said he could only offer me a refund on the one drink, or a free drink to replace it. Insulted, I told him I don't care about the 2 bucks. No apology. I just walked out as they continued to pour drinks from that same moldy fountain.   Absolutely disgusting. I will never eat at this jimmy johns again."}
{"text":"Great place and food. Unfriendly staff. Looked bored and over worked. Staff listening to music so loud I couldn't hear my own thoughts. Staff sing loudly to music as well."}
{"text":"Freaky Fast my a**..   Over an hour to deliver a sandwich less than a mile. Where is the nearest Which Which when you need it."}
{"text":"I would give them 0 stars if it was available. This is the worst jimmy johns in the area. The manager has a bad attitude and makes you feel stupid. Let me tell you about the last time I was there a few weeks ago.  Granted it was about 1:30 an and was relatively busy.  I ordered a few club lulu sandwiches with cheese and a bag of BBQ chips. The sandwich was made by the time the cashier swiped my card.  We sat down near the soda machine and munched away on our sandwiches and talking about random events that took place during the nights adventures. As we finished up our sandwiches we decided to grab the BBQ chips on the way out because we got all fought up in conversation that I didn't get a chance to eat them. And yes I think the BBQ chips are there best option.   K here's where the whole thing when down hill. As I started walking out I got grabbed and almost thrown down by one of the employees that was making the sandwiches. He grabbed the chips out of my hands and yelled \"I Don't think so dude\" and then he started telling people in the restaurant and the staff that I had already eaten my chips and that I was stealing another bag.! Are you freaking kidding?!! He assaulted me then embarrassed me in front of everybody because he thought I was stealing a freaking 1.50 bag of chips!!  I asked to speak to the manager, at this point I was furious. I explained to him and confirmed with the cashier that I paid for a bag of chips and the sandwiches. they were made so fast that we just sat down and ate the sandwiches and grabbed the chips on the way out.   He said. \" well that's bs, my employee says you already ate a bag of chips and I believe him over you so, unless you want to actually pay for something were done\"  Just a bunch of poorly trained staff, who abide by there own set of rules. Poor poor jimmy johns. Actually disappointed they let this happen"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! Worlds Greatest Gourmet Sandwich? I got a #12 that was supposed to have turkey, cheese, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, avocado spread, and mayo. I posted the only photo posted so far (#12 and inside of a #12) There was hardly any meat! Never tasted the avocado? Tomato's... Are you kidding me?! I know this place has enough money to add on enough since there were 10 other workers, but then again they were all playing around.  This was my first (and only time) here and the workers just stared at me... I even asked questions and no response.  What does a person have to do to get some damn good service and food?! I don't even want to rate this, but I HAVE to, so it's getting 1 star. I spoke to the manager, Josh. I explained the situation and he apologized. He could only make me another sandwich, but not reimburse me. HA.  Pathetic."}
{"text":"Love Jimmy John's and this is a great location.  They keep the customers moving even during the busy lunch rush.    Every morning when I walk into work you can smell their bread baking.  I don't know how they make it taste so good, but I don't think any sandwich place has better bread.  My favorite sandwich is probably the Vito.  It is their version of an Italian hoagie and has great flavor.    I do wish they would add some more options to their menu or maybe have a sandwich of the month.  But they are great at what they do so I guess that is why they stick with what they know."}
{"text":"Sandwich shops are so hit and miss with how fresh the meats and cheeses are and the quantity of the content inside.   I'm an unwich eater due to my gluten intolerance and at first I wondered why would anyone spend so much on a \"wrapped salad.\" They are so good and so filling! I really don't miss the bread and I'm not hungry still without it!   The key is to eat it wrapped. Then it won't fall apart.   So good!"}
{"text":"Came here for a sandwich. When I got home there was nothing but lettuce and tomatoes on the sandwich. Maybe if I was lucky 2 pieces of turkey. Sandwich was prepared before I even had the opportunity to ask for cheese. I get the speedy service but I would rather good service then fast. My lettuce and tomato sandwich was also very dry."}
{"text":"This place is great! Not only are the sandwiches phenomenal but the people at this location are so wonderful. They're always so nice and helpful. And I swear they only hire attractive men at this location, because every time I go there is another cutie working."}
{"text":"This location just opened up next to my apartment building! Staff is super friendly, and when I called them for delivery they were literally at my door 5 minutes later!"}
{"text":"Ordered my sandwich and then sat down at the table with my sandwich. Saw that they had hot peppers waited in line again to ask for a side of hot peppers. Sorry we do not give out sides of hot peppers. So I ask since I have already have my sandwich it is too late to receive hot peppers? Yes sorry. Apparently they do not practice common sense or customer service at all at this location. Go to Jersey Mikes instead."}
{"text":"This location is THE WORST.  Poor customer service, wrong orders, and slow.   I have ordered from this location over 5 different times and each time they have gotten things wrong and are freakishly slow. I have finally learned my lesson. You order NO Mayo they put Mayo, you pay extra for avocado you do not get avocado, you request the sandwich to be cut in 1/2 and they do not cut the sandwich in 1/2. Each time I have ordered from this location, they have gotten the orders wrong. I was frustrated last week as I ordered a sandwich for my boss and of course the order was wrong.  I called and the representative regarding the mistakes and his response \"Yeah sometimes we get it wrong, it happens did you want me to make you another one or what?\"  If the new sandwich would have been delivered quickly and accurately then maybe yes but since they do not get the orders done correctly I said no thank you. He responded well then what did you need......   We now order from Dilly's Deli.... Dilly dilly"}
{"text":"I love jimmy johns but today I was a little unhappy with the unwhich I normally get. It literally had two slices of turkey and 1 of cheese. I asked for no tomatoes and they gave me 4! More tomato then meat! I paid 8.00 for 2 slices of turkey  I'll def be going to subway next time. Feeling disappointed!"}
{"text":"So I posted a few weeks ago about the Jimmy John's on Baseline & Country Club and how they refused to deliver to our building (among other issues).  Well who do I just see at our reception desk?  THE JIMMY JOHN'S DELIVERY GUY!  So I ask him, \"how come you wouldn't deliver here last time we tried to order?\" At first he refused to answer so I followed him out the door and he finally said, \"I don't know!  Ask my manager!\"   Then I went back inside to check with the department who ordered the sandwiches... there was a drink missing from their order and one of them had the wrong sandwich.  Nice..."}
{"text":"First timer here.  So this place is okay if you want something quick and a sandwich.   Tried their #5 the Vito, which is an Italian Sub with genoa salami, Provolone cheese, capicola, held the onion, with lettuce, tomato and Italian vinaigrette and added some hot peppers which I am so glad I did.   The hot peppers gave help enhance the flavor of my sub.  The bread that it was in between reminded of an enhanced garlic bread from Olive Garden minus the garlic flavor and butter.  I don't know if having your bread toasted is an option but I kind of wish mine was.  Then it would have been perfect.  Other than that, this place isn't too bad.  The service in this place is super-fast!  I can say that I was out of there in less than 5 minutes.  Impressed.  Plus you had employees just ready to make an order for you.  With that being said, Happy Eatings!  Until next time. @~~}~~~"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would. This was so incredibly disappointing. When you order the #6 as a lettuce wrap, I'd expect more, but this was beyond disappointing. Essentially it was lettuce wrapped mayonnaise with a slice of cheese, a cucumber, and a tomato. I shared half with a friend. This is ridiculous. Like for real? That's what I spent money on? Are you kidding?  Needless to say we were both disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered a Pepe cause I love ham. But they put turkey instead. I'll give a star for the extra mayo tho. Took away the taste of turkey."}
{"text":"I was indecisive between rating it 2 stars or 3 stars; but the reason I gave it 2 stars is because I have never had any luck with delivery. The sandwiches are good, and the employees are nice. But for once, it would be great if they could just get my order right.   It's convenient for us that they deliver when we don't feel like leaving the couch on the weekends. However, every single time we have ordered a delivery, they either forget the drinks, or the chips, or they charge us for large drinks but give us medium drinks. We called back once when they forgot something, but it took them 45 minutes to come back (they are only a little over 5 minutes down the road from us). So after that, we just kind of \"dealt with it\" when they got our order wrong.   The problem is, no customer should ever have to \"deal with it\". I understand their goal is to deliver as fast as possible, but getting the order correct is just as important."}
{"text":"I was so excited when a Jimmy Johns finally opened in Uptown. I was desperately in need of a new quick lunch place near my office, and Jimmy Johns was one of my top lunch spots when I lived in Chicago. I think the bread is what makes these sandwiches better than others. I usually get the No. 6 vegetarian, which comes with provolone, cucumbers, sprouts and avocado.   They have really quick service, which is great when you're in a hurry. Even their delivery is speedy. They have bike messengers who deliver the takeout orders and they usually arrive about 10 minutes after I order by phone. The only downside is that there aren't tables there. You pretty much have to take the food to go."}
{"text":"There's a blonde worker there, she's really short, has short hair and she is just the cutest thing I've ever seen, she's so sweet too!  Made my day, and had incredible service and had a great sandwich afterwards."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I ordered something with turkey in it but instead I got this lettuce sandwich along with some unwarranted attitude from one of the workers when I asked for some napkins. It's Jimmy John's ffs - how hard can it be to make a fucking sandwich? 3 stars for this location, c'mon guys...wake up."}
{"text":"This is the second Jimmy John's I've been to in this area. You can see my other review of the Jimmy John's Gourmet Subs in Kent. Again I went to this one second due to the poor reviews I saw on Yelp. This is much closer for me as I only live about 1 mile away. The atmosphere was quieter than then one in Kent, most likely due to the one in Kent being in a University setting. I did not find the staff rude, yes they were quiet, but not rude. I do have to admit though I ordered there for take out, so I can't speak for delivery. The food was the same or similar to the one in Kent. Would I return to this one? Yes, mainly because it's much closer, and on this trip, I didn't experience rudeness. I have yet to try the one at the Plaza on Howe rd."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Jimmy John's. I was told they were better and cheaper than Subway. They were more flavorful, and cheaper per sandwich than Subway. I don't live close to this one but drove to it due to poor reviews to the ones closer. The staff was very nice and courteous. The food was prepared fast, actually faster than Subway. Subway subs on a per inch basis is cheaper slightly, a Jimmy John's 12\" sub would be around 7.10 while Subway's are 5.00. The advantage of Subway over Jimmy John's is that you could split a Subway sub for two meals where Jimmy John's only one. Over all, I have to admit that Jimmy John's is a better sub, and I will be returning. I went to this JJ again due to reviews and will go to the one on Howe Rd, and Hudson Dr. to see if they are as rude as the reviews claimed. When I do, I'll post my thoughts there also."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day, the staff was super fun, the store was clean, and my sandwich was great! Highly recommend checking it out. They also have a big catering menu!"}
{"text":"Easy-to-use online ordering and fast delivery, but not a fan of their sandwiches. Tried the tuna, and it was mediocre."}
{"text":"I have been ordering online here for almost a year and everyone I work with orders from here. They usually are good about getting the delivery out in good time, that was not the case today. I always like to order my meal ahead of time, and today it did not arrive. When I called to see where my order was, the manager named Sam said his driver got a flat tire but he has another driver on the way and should be delivering my food in 5 minutes. I understand, things happen, so I waited for my order. 10minutes pass and my order still has not arrived, contact the store again and speak to the manager again and he tells me the same thing. I let him know the same thing was said 10 mind earlier the he proceeds to say that his driver isn't answering and should have been there by now. He did offer to comp my next meal, which I wasn't looking for a free meal, I just wanted my food. An additional 10 mins pass and still no food! At this point my lunch break is just about over and haven't eaten. Call again and speak to the manager again. I told him I am not paying for a soggy sandwich, cuz I mean come on, that's not even appealing at this point. I ask for him to get fresh sandwich to me within the next 10 mins so I can eat something(I am literally like 2 mins away from the store) he says he will not be doing that, that I have to pay full price for a soggy sandwich but he will comp my next meal. I asked if he really wasn't going to try and get that to me, the entire office orders from them all the time. He said that he was going to cancel my order that he doesn't need out business, that he will do just fine without our business. Well then Mr Sam Store Manager, you got it! Will not be ordering from your store again. Horrible customer service! No remorse, had a full I don't care attitude, and not willing to be a manager and make sure frequent customers are take of your customers and make those remarks. It's a shame the great food there isn't enough to make up for that bad attitude."}
{"text":"I have been to many an event catered by Jimmy John's, and it is always a bummer. This is because for their catering menu, the only vegetarian option they have is a sandwich that basically has provolone and flavorless \"guacamole\" paste. It's a shame."}
{"text":"We just ordered from this JJs for my office lunch (company orders from them and Milio's regularly because they're fast and deliver). It's been an hour since I received confirmation, so it's not living up the \"freaky fast\" promise. We're all having to delay lunch until it gets here, so we're not super thrilled with this experience. I'll update on our next order, they're usually great."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are usually fresh, accurate, and delivered quickly from this location.   **Personal note: do not prefer to eat in at this location, as the employees listen to music at a deafening level.  Only real gripe, minor as it may be, is that they consistently do not cut the sandwich in half if you check the box \"Cut in half\" for an online order. My most recent order, both myself and the other person checked \"Cut in half\" and neither of our sandwiches arrived that way. It's part of the ordering process, so it'd be nice if this were adhered to."}
{"text":"I'm so sad to see how this place almost REFUSES to WASH THEIR HANDS!!!! We frequent(ed) this location and almost every time,  the cashier will work with money, then put on  gloves, without washing their hands. I have actually asked the cashier to please wash their hands before putting on gloves and handling food.  He seemed appalled by my request.  I've seen delivery drivers run in, NOT WASH THEIR HANDS, throw on gloves and handle food.  There's a reason for handwashing.  Train your employees! I have talked with numerous people who have all experienced the same, disgusting, non hand washing problem.  PROBLEM!! With all the sickness going around,  be a responsible adult. Respect others, and try not to make your customers sick!"}
{"text":"Usually love this place, and dig the #5 Vito...figured out the secret to how fast they are...they forget to add meat to their sandwich!! Not happy and very hungry!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable! ! I just ordered online ,after waiting an hour for my sandwich that never showed up i call the  store and the delivery girl gave my sandwich to my  neighbor? ?!! The neighbor said it was his so she just gave it to him? ?! Its obviously not the right address or the right name that ordered? ! And all they have to say was its your neighbor mam like they did nothing wrong,pure incompetence! !ill never order from them again and i suggest you don't either unless you want to feed your neighborhood and not yourself .i wish i could give them 0 stars ..so disappointed.!"}
{"text":"Once again. Order delivered wrong. Who's the fool now. Ok...I'll quit ordering from there. smh"}
{"text":"Not empressed  at all my friend waited for this  sandwich  shop to open. We got so excited. I ordered a sandwich  and it was very bland and they didn't even toast it. It looked so pale that it didn't look appetizing. I ate half and I really didn't get excited."}
{"text":"I've ordered online for delivery quite a few times from this location, and like all Jimmy John's I was not at all disappointed. Arrived quickly to my house, smile on the delivery person's face and sandwich was delicious. Best part, there isn't an insane delivery charge for your stuff. The actual building is nice too the one time I went in. Friendly staff. Would recommend this location as well as Jimmy John's in general. Subway has nothing on Jimmy John's!"}
{"text":"I finally satisfied my craving for a JJ Gargantuan after months of being Jimmy John's absent while in Canada and it didn't disappoint! Delicious as usual. This time I added a pickle which I didn't think would be that big a deal, but this was a massive pickle! Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Another great Jimmy John's experience and another delicious JJ Gargantuan. This time it was in a combo with a drink and salt and vinegar chips. I learned that a pickle is an option for the combo. That would be a great choice next time. This location seemed very clean and was pretty big. Service was courteous and fast. Couldn't really find napkins though, but no biggie, I just asked."}
{"text":"There's fast, then there's freaky fast, then there's whatever THAT was during my visit. No kidding, my usual (a JJ Gargantuan) was handed to me just as I finished paying for my order! And it was every bit as good as every other time. They really blew me away!"}
{"text":"I've discovered Jersey Mikes and Port of Subs since my last Jimmy Johns visit and I can say that while the other two are similar to one another, JJ is a little different. My sub, the Gargantuan, is extremely meaty. More so than the others. The bread is also different. It is more dense. They're all delicious but it's nice to have some differentiation.   One place where JJ can get an extra point is to be able to sprinkle more vinegar on my sub without it having to the the oil and vinegar mix. The amount of vinegar I'd want would make my sub an oily mess. So when I really need to have a more tart sub it'll likely be Port of Subs. But for an otherwise awesome meat-filled monster, bring me my Gargantuan!"}
{"text":"As much as I've been enjoying my run of Blimpie and Port of Subs it's always nice to have Jimmy Johns. The bread is a little more dense and substantial, so different, in a good way. And the meats in the Gargantuan are distinguishable from one another. Darn good sandwich.   Nice little treat today... I noticed Vitamin Water as one of the fountain drinks. Different and refreshing!"}
{"text":"Was really disappointed today.    The girl at the front was totally distracted and looking around while taking my order.  I think I had like one slice of turkey on my sandwich.  I always order no mayo here because they seem to like to overdo it...so today I ordered dijon mustard and there was hardly any at all.    Usually this place is really good, but not today.  I will go back and see if maybe today was just \"one of those days\"."}
{"text":"$1 subs on customer appreciation day once a year. It's a great deal! There are usually a lot of people in line but JJ prepares for that and you get in and out in about 15 minutes or less. That's pretty good when there are 30 orders in front of you.  I usually get the Vito because I like salami and the Italian meats. The taste of the subs have a little more flavor than Subway. Of course, you don't get to choose your veggies to put on there, but it tastes good and the service is super fast.  The chips aren't bad either. They have a good selection. Overall, if you are willing to pay a little more, this could be the place for you. Actually, it's probably the same price as Subway if you don't get Subway's $5 footlong deal. So either way, it just depends on what you like. But I can say that JJ tastes just a little better."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 5 stars, food is always awesome.  Today, this location made both of our sandwiches oh HARD STALE bread....  I mean Jimmy Johns bread is awesome, and as cheap as the bread is, relative to all the meat and cheese on the sandwich, you would think that they could afford to throw away the stale bread.  Will continue to order from here, however, I will definitely ask for FRESH BREAD next time.!  Sad... shouldn't have to do that, agreed???"}
{"text":"This place sucks. No pickles?  They give you a whole pickle for $1 and you have to slice it yourself. If you want mustard they give you a packet of mustard and you have to do it yourself.  If I wanted to slice my own pickles and add my own mustard I can just make my own sub at home. This place has the worst service and too many rules for making a sub.  Port of Subs and Blimpie are much better!"}
{"text":"I like jimmy johns and people here are always friendly. But they never get my order right. I ask for cucumbers and sprouts with my turkey sandwich. They ALWAYS forget to put them in. It's always they forget to put the sprouts in or they forget to put the cucumbers in or both. Meh.. Never has this location got it right ever."}
{"text":"So this store made our sandwiches wrong, the delivery guy argued with us and then took our sandwiches back; delivering the right ones 40 minutes later. While we ate our chips, pickles and drank our half spilt Dr Pepper.  It's always an argument with them, so we filed a complaint and spoke to a nice guy at corporate who offered to make it up to us and buy our meals. Really nice right? We place our order, exactly the same as the one we ordered before and always order. AGAIN it's an argument, just the sandwiches were to be free but the whole meal was messed up with the Dr Pepper half in the bag and eating a pickle and chips as the dinner. I don't have time to argue with people over something SO STUPID! This place is absolutely horrible! I will order pizza for my employees and never again eat here! I highly recommend you skip Jimmy Johns!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Jimmy Johns and I will not be back. There are so many sandwich chains that have better bread, give you more meat and have fresher ingredients. The bread on my sandwich was squished - my husband actually thought they scraped out the inside of my bread like some places do for 'low carb' option. An extraordinary amount of mayonnaise was put on my sandwich - I like mayonnaise but not huge globs of it. There was a rather small amount of meat included in my sandwich. The shredded lettuce was soggy and had some brown pieces included.  I hope this feedback provides management with some guidance. Additionally, please remind the staff that they should focus on the customers and save their sode conversations when customers are not right in front of them."}
{"text":"I keep trying to give this place a chance but I think I'm done. As I type I have been waiting 40 minutes for my.food, I work across the street. I don't get it. They are always slow, and sometimes my bread is super hard. Jimmy John's is supposed to be quick.  I order it on busy work days when I don't have time to get up from my desk. This is absurd."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Jimmy Johns. What struck me as odd is if you want a condiment on your sub you have to ask for packets from the person making the sub!  Kind of crazy from my point of view. From my experience sub shops generally put the condiments on the sub when you eat there. I ordered a Turkey Tom with a double portion of meat because the amount of meat on that sandwich is not enough in my opinion. That was an extra $2 but I thought it was worth it. My wife ordered the slim 4 which is a turkey sub with cheese. $1 more for cheese. So the Slim 4 cost $5 plus $1 for cheese. All my wife had was just turkey, cheese and a packet of mayo on her sub!  The Turkey Tom set ne back $6.25 plus $2 for the extra portion of turkey. That is all we ordered and it came to $15.40 after tax. That's okay I guess. I give my experience 3 stars out of 5."}
{"text":"This is a good, solid sandwich spot.  They have a menu of several interesting sandwiches to choose from.  I like that the subs are the same 8\" size and the same French bread.  Not as many decisions to make that way.  I had the Vito which is basically an Italian sub. Salami, capicola, provolone, etc.  They make their own bread which is nice because it's not too thick or puffed up with air like Subway.  My sandwich, chips and drink cost less than $7.50 total which is a good value.  My only complaint is the iced tea.  You have to get it from the soda fountain.  Not so good.  I'd like to see something like China Mist as an option.  I'm not sure where the other five star reviews are coming from.  Must be strictly nostalgia from the good old days in Illinois?  I give them a 3 or 3 1/2 rating overall."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time. The subs were good and they were quick in making our food. The only complaint that I have is that the music was too loud. I couldn't understand what the lady taking my order was saying. I am 33 years old and have some hearing loss from my time time in the military. I'll be back again and hopefully the music will be at a lower level next time."}
{"text":"New: got in touch with someone willing too hear me out!I  do appreciate cooperate or franchise businesses taking the time and effort. It is a business that you started and glad that you saw my point of view, definitely don't want your effort too go too waste. I will give it another go soon! Thank you."}
{"text":"Usually these guys come through but today my food never showed up, so I called to cancel and they didn't even offer anything to make up for it, I only have a half hour for lunch so here I am hungry waiting for the day to end and couldn't even get a free sub for not getting my food I don't think that's very good customer service"}
{"text":"Very friendly customer oriented place to eat the cashier misunderstood my daughters order and she got tuna instead of turkey but they were quick to fix the problem and even gave her a card for a free sandwich next time .... Now that is customer service thanks jimmy johns for a great experience we love your sandwiches!!"}
{"text":"This Jimmy Johns should get an award for the friendliest staff ever! It's the only one I'll go to, I wish all of them were this nice. I will return!"}
{"text":"On multiple occasions, I have had my sammich in my hands before I'm even finished paying.    This JJ is ultra fast... and  it may or may not have to do with it being overstaffed.  There's someone to yell a greeting to you as you walk in, someone to take your order, a few heads on the sammich line, a cashier, and I'm pretty sure we got a farewell holler too.  How about they donate someone to the bake-Tricia-some-of-that-awesome-wheat-bread-on-a-daily-basis cause?"}
{"text":"They always deliver my food really fast and it's never wrong ! I love it. When I call they sound so happy."}
{"text":"Took 50 minutes for a stale sandwich to be delivered 4 miles away. Disappointed and taking my sandwich needs else where."}
{"text":"Morins can't even take a simple sandwich order JORGE is a deaf ass retard the mangers keep letting him take the orders when he constantly fucks them up. Clowns and morons work at this location call manger he is king of the dipshits there."}
{"text":"Love this place. The employees are awesome.the food is so fresh. And the delivery of the food is fast."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's and now that I discovered the unwich it's a definite place that I'll go back to many times. The ingredients are always fresh and people are always friendly!"}
{"text":"Decent good food at jimmy johns. I prefer the one on grant street but I don't mind this one."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch last week and ordered my usual.. Club Lulu. It was delicious, affordable and staff was friendly. I stopped by around 1pm and it wasnt too crowded."}
{"text":"We stopped by after visiting a show at the convention center. It was snowing & we were starving.   This location seems to be pretty new. It has plenty of seating and seems to be very clean.   We ordered a #16 -I can't remember the name :/ it had turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato & mayo. The sandwich tasted so fresh! Better than anyyyy subway or Penn coast sub I've had. Seriously. I've been to another JJ's downtown but this one seems to be a better choice.  We were still hungry after splitting a sub and didn't want to go home and cook after braving the snow. We decided to get the exact sandwich again lol. Just as fresh as the first one.  This location is super convenient to the convention center, Amtrak & Greyhound station & The Westin. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Pretty good in my opinion. Love Jimmy Johns. I always order Club Lulu (#16. You'll thank me later)"}
{"text":"LOVE JIMMY JOHNS.... But I'm kind of pissed at this location.  I was overcharged and not given my appropriate change back.  I was upsold on my sandwich and not informed of the extra dollar charge as well.  Also, at the time I began this review, workers in the back were \"pretending\" to sneeze on things.  Not appropriate for food service.  I have never had a problem at the ones back home in South Dakota.  PS: I WOULD GO TO A LOCATION IN LOS ANGELES IF THEY HAD FRANCHISES HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Jimmy johns is always good, this location had great staff and fast service. It was busy but we were in and out quickly, I had the tuna sandwich which was really good. The bread was fresh and not dried out or hard like a rock at other sandwich places. Definitely tastes! This location is clean and reasonably priced. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"fast delivery, friendly driver, and the food is great. thanks"}
{"text":"This place is great and has some different items on the menu. The one we went to make us made upset when I forgot to order my sub with cucumbers and they had to get a manager to get them. A bit dumb.  I order the sandwich with the whole grain bread but peel off the crust. It is a bit too much for me."}
{"text":"I think jimmy johns should have a jimmy-off. See which store can make the sammiches the fastest.  I ordered. Walked over to fill my cup so I could wet my taste buds and before I could even start filling it with delicious orange soda I heard \"#9 with hot pepper!\".  Fast!  Bathroom was also very clean and the line of customers in front of me moved very quickly."}
{"text":"Fast and delicious.  -1 star because they wont deliver to me!!!  I live about .5 miles north and yet they tell me I am not within their delivery zone (which shows how lazy i am. Im so ashamed. Oh well...)"}
{"text":"Rude staff. Short with you in convo (if you can call it that). No greeting. When I asked a question I got a mean answer without any eye contact. I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Went to pick up a sandwich for my husband this afternoon. Place was super clean. Employees were nice and I was in and out in under 5 mins. Am definitely going back and already recommend this location."}
{"text":"Figured I would give Jimmy Johns a try since they were doing the $1 subs for their anniversary.  Even though they had a line out the door they managed to keep things moving and get the people through in a quick and efficient manner.  The store itself is nicely decorated and kept clean.  I ordered the 8\" tuna sub which comes with lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers; I had them add onions and hot peppers.  The sub was nothing special; the tuna was OK, but seemed to lack something.  The vegies were nothing special, even the hot peppers seemed a bit mild and one note.  The bun was my least favorite part, for a fresh baked roll it lacked any crispness or punch.    While I would compliment Jimmy Johns on most areas, they fall far short in the food area and that makes it a pass for me."}
{"text":"Coming from the deli-centric lifestyle of the American Northeast, it's hard to give chain sandwich shops a fighting chance.  While relocating to Charlotte, my realtor took me to this Jimmie John's, and changed my opinion forever! I ordered what I call the \"tester\"; an Italian sub/grinder/hoagie.  It's the same sandwich I order when gauging a sandwich shop's chops.  In this particular case, it's a #5, or a Vito in Jimmie John's colloquial speech.  I was amazed at the freshness of the ingredients.  The veggies were crisp and snappy, the tomatoes were ripe but not mushy, and the meats were fresh and flavorful.  The biggest eye-popper/tastebud dropper was the bread!  Fresh, buttery, and just the right texture!  Altogether, I was hooked from the first bite.  The bread-to-meat-to-veggie ratio is spot on, and the portions are perfect.  The sandwichologists at this location seem like they've trained with a Pit Crew, as the orders were placed and processed in no time at all. Great food, great service, reasonable prices. Noosh"}
{"text":"I was placing an order for delivery Friday march 24th at 11:15 am and I politely asked for my bacon to be crispy on my BLT (when I ordered last time the bacon was so chewy couldn't even eat the sandwich) the man on the phone said I get what I get they can't make the bacon crispy. So I canceled my order. Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"Don't know how this place is a chain or survives. People who frequent these establishments don't know what a good sandwich is.  I personally love Ham and Swiss with cucumbers and spicy/regular mustard. Can't get that there. Today the kids wanted Turkey, cheese and mustard... They got Turkey on bread.  The shop forgot cheese and they don't do mustard. My husbands friend takes him there a couple times a month and he Wastes his well earned money on that crapola! I've had one garbage sandwich from there two years ago and when asked if I want something from Jimmy Johns, I Always say No Thank You!"}
{"text":"Seriously can't complain. Fast and they deliver even faster. The un-wich is solid for any sub (lettuce wrap). Please make sure you too your delivery person.....especially if you are ordering ONE sub from your ivory tower. These people brave the Cleveland elements when you don't want to"}
{"text":"Speedy delivery!!! Also my custom order was made to perfection! Complements to the professional sandwich maker!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here about a week ago.  I had the #5 totally tuna.  It had a ton of tuna and everything was very cold in a good way.  I haven't been eating bread so this was like total junk food for me.  I will be going back.  No problem."}
{"text":"i think this place is overrated....the food is never that good and the staff is and alwas has been kind of blah! avoid if ya can and save your money...its not cheap for a sandwich shop....go next door to the next place"}
{"text":"A restaurant can have a menu a mile long and do things well or it can have a small menu and o things GREAT. Jimmy's is the ladder. A simple menu done really well. Basic ingredients that are fresh and tasty.  Fresh baked bread engulfs the most basic meats and cheeses with a little mayo, lettuce, and tomato.  The price is right too. The large sandwich is under $6 and will satisfy you considerably more than your local Subway or Port of Subs.  Great personalities up front and truly the fastest service I have ever seen. There were two people in line when I walked in the door and I walked out the door 5 minutes later with two sandwiches in my hand. WOW, speed, service, and quality all in the same place.  Truly a triple threat. Give it a try, you will happy you did."}
{"text":"I have ordered here twice now and it is only a mile away from my store. 4 minutes MAX to get here. It was definitely not \"so fast you could freak\" both times has taken 40-50 minutes to get here, and my lunch is now over. Ridiculous. If your slogan is promoting your fast service, I suggest you give it to paying customers."}
{"text":"Super inconsistent. The first time we tried this location we had our sandwiches delivered. The second time I called to have them delivered the person on the phone told me the house was too far. I informed them we just had them delivered and they said there was nothing they could do. Understandable. I assumed the first person may have just made a mistake, until I looked up the distance which turned out to only be 2.2 miles from the shop. Hmmm. Oh well, I'll still go through the drive threw. My turkey tom (with sprouts of course) had been coming out with wayyy too much mayo lately, so I decided to ask for light mayo this time because I was sick of globs of it coming out of my sandwich every time I took a bite. Of course now there was near to none. Today we got two turkey toms and decided to not say anything and see how they turn out. Way too much mayo. Not surprised. This location is closer to my boyfriends house but it looks like we'll only be eating Jimmy John's when we're at mine; I never have any problems with the Lake Mead location."}
{"text":"Based on my recent visit: 10/29/2013 at 12:10pm  Worst possible service ever from Order Taker Kristen.  I've been craving some Jimmy John's for over a week now and when I saw their sign today I decided that I knew what I was going to have for lunch. I pull up to a crammed parking lot and manage to find a spot close by.  \"Ahhh\" the sigh of relief when I make my way to the establishment. Being in such a wonderful mood I walk in with anticipation of cheerful greetings (which is what I love about this company) but to my surprise I get a stare.  \"Hello\", \"How are you?\", or \"What are we having today?\"... none of these phrases were said. I was about to walk out but wanted the sandwich so bad! So I bared a grin and told the girl what I wanted.   \"That it?\"  O.o \"Excuse me?\"  \"Is that it?\"  I was beyond peeved but my mission was to get a sub regardless of service. I told the girl no onions and I had to read the register to know my total because she didn't say. I handed her my card and waited there for my receipt.  Waiting... waiting... (I think I heard grass grow)...  \"Oh you get your receipt when you get your food\"  She never asked me if I wanted it for here or to go so I grabbed my sub and left the building. I don't like to review a place unless it knocks my socks off or pushes my buttons. This place really pushed my button.  I will try this place out again but not for a while. I hope the next time I come here things will be better, because I really like their food and the location is near my school."}
{"text":"The only location on Mill which will charge you for water. This is practically saying \"we are only interested in your money. You are not a guest but only a customer here\""}
{"text":"I eat at several Jimmy Johns all over the valley and generally like the  sub sandwiches.  Stopped in this Jimmy Johns a few weeks ago and the guy behind the counter was just rude so I just turned around and walked out."}
{"text":"Been to this location twice.  The first time the place was dirty (booth ) and Crappy service.   The second time the place was dirty and Crappy service.   I will not be back"}
{"text":"I prefer Jimmy John's over Subway, and this one is your typical JJ's. Fast and well prepared subs. Friendly crew that work here as well."}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from this Jimmy John's location multiple times. They are always extremely fast in delivering my order to my apartment downtown. The delivery person thanks me for my business. The food always tastes good. My favorite sub is the Club Lulu, which has turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on French bread. The price is inexpensive."}
{"text":"I love jimmy johns!! But  first time at this location and I have been waiting 10 mins for my sandwich! And there is maybe 6 ppl in here! That is just insane I would hate to see this place if they were slammed !!! And they have about 5 ppl working!!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for lunch after work. My man picked me up and we were in the mood for a sandwich. I was so glad we found a JJ's nearby! The store was clean and employees very helpful and friendly.  I ordered a \"Beach Club\". It had Fresh baked turkey breast, provolone cheese, avocado spread, sliced cucumber, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I asked them to leave the sprouts off and they said they didn't offer them anymore so I don't know if that is just this location no longer offering them or all of them. This sandwich was delicious! I could eat one everyday! The cost for this sandwich was $5.75  My man had the \"Italian Night Club\". He actually ordered 2 of these because he has a big appetite and the sandwiches are just 8 inches so not quite the footling you would get at Subway. This sandwich had genoa salami, Italian capicola, smoked ham, and provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, and Italian vinaigrette. This sandwich also cost $5.75  JJ's delivers an caters. You can place orders online.  I love JJ's! The prices are very affordable for what you get. This will make a great lunch stop while working on this side of town. I'm a fan and will be back!"}
{"text":"I love JJ's! The sandwiches are good and they make them quick. I have never had a bad experience at this location. I wish the parking were better sometimes but I guess a full lot means they are doing something right. With Omelette House nearby at busy times you can end up parking just about anywhere in the lot and walking to JJ's lol."}
{"text":"What a great business model:   1. Hire young kids to work the counter who have no training in customer service.   2. Overcharge for sandwiches with absolutely no spoken or obvious options. (If they exist this is news to me.)   3. Offer delivery, but confine it to a 1/4 mile square area. (Basically the area of the shopping center they're located in.)  Yup, looks like this place will be another victim of a trend. I will usually visit a place multiple times if I'm told that it's something special even if the first experience is something less than ideal. This location has let me down so many times with poor customer service the likelihood of a return visit is completely null and void.   Hey Jimmy, you should try and rethink and regroup on this one buddy. Trends only last for a short while and fade away with phone books and record players. You may have your time, but it won't last with this formula."}
{"text":"I went during Speed street.  I must say it was cheaper than the vendors on the street.  However, the sandwich was not worth sharing with friends.  I was surprised considering my coworkers love this place. I am not sure if it has something to do with location.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Jimmy John's in a long time and decided to stop by. I used to frequent a couple locations in town weekly, but then I started noticing the quality of the meat wasn't that great and chose other sandwich shops instead. This location has a drive-thru making stopping by for a quick bite even more convenient and freaky fast than the locations without one. The employees working were upbeat and helpful.   #12 Beach Club ($6.50) - I ordered this on 7 grain bread. The sandwich has turkey, provolone cheese, avocado spread, cucumber, lettuce, tomato and mayo. When I first started eating this sandwich years ago it came with sprouts and then a year or so ago they did away with the sprouts. Now the sandwich still comes with lettuce, but sprouts are available in the store again as an option. The turkey lacked flavor to me and reminded me of the last few times I ordered this sandwich and didn't like it much. The bread and veggies were fresh and tasty though. I ended up taking the turkey off and just eating the sandwich veggie style and enjoyed it. They offer a veggie sammie that comes with everything this one has minus the meat, so I'd probably order that if I made my way back. The sandwich is enough to fill me, but my hubby has to order 2 sandwiches when getting it on the French roll to get full. Basically this place is doable if I'm nearby and want something quick and easy.   Delivery is an option and you can phone your order in also."}
{"text":"The cold sandwiches are bla. Make sure you add a lot of stuff for flavor because the standard sandwich comes with only mayo lettuce and tomato."}
{"text":"My sandwich was amazing. The meat and vegetables were so fresh!!! I had never eaten there before and I loved it. Reason for 4 stars: Sweet tea container filled with unsweetened tea. Blech! Otherwise everything was great, the food and the service were perfect. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, tasty.  Pretty hard to screw up a sandwich.  This place is really good."}
{"text":"Funny staff. Located right by the Starbucks huge plus. Speed of service is legendary. Great classic rock tunes playing."}
{"text":"My friend and I order from this location at least twice a month and 99% of the time they are super quick (from 8 min - AMAZING!! to around 25 min) and they are always fresh subs - The only mess up was once they put lettuce on my sub... when I said no on my on-line order.  The tuna is my favorite  - Their subs are way better than Subway in my opinion"}
{"text":"I'd been hearing about Jimmy John's at Cityscape since they opened and decided to walk the 6 blocks this weekend to check 'em out (and get some fresh 100º air). Next time, I'll stop walking after 2. I'm not saying the food was bad. It just wasn't anything I'd describe beyond average. To be fair, I ordered the #11 Country Club, which is nearly impossible to mess up. But don't expect to be blown away either. On the bright side, the service was very friendly and quick, if that's what you're into."}
{"text":"Best Jimmy John's I have ever used. Always correct order. Fast af. Fresh every time. Extremely polite drivers. Exceptional customer service."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star, I would. We just moved into a neighborhood that had a Jimmy Johns nearby and decided to give it a try. These were the worst subs that we have ever had. Between there being next to no meat and the most disgusting bacon that I have ever tasted, I was very disappointed. The delivery was as fast as advertised, but they delivered garbage food. Needless to say we will never eat at any Jimmy Johns again and I will encourage all of my friends and family to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Depending on where I find myself - I go to the location on Sunset (near Sunset Station) or the one on Lake Mead Parkway (near Target).  But no more - the service and more recently, the food at the Lake Mead Parkway location is so bad, I won't be able to go back there anymore.  Once, they just didn't make my order and after watching customers who arrived after me be served their orders 'freaky fast' - I finally asked about the status of mine.  They apologized, of course ... but it STILL didn't get into the prep line!  Very frustrating.  On two other occasions, we arrived home twice to find that they had made a Tuna sandwich instead of the Veggie, which was really annoying. The Tuna is #3, so now I order the sandwiches by name so they don't mis-hear 3 instead of 13.  Yesterday, when I suggested JJ's for lunch - my mom asked if we could go to the Target near Sunset instead of the one on Lake Mead for the SOLE reason that we'd be nearer the Sunset Jimmy John's.  When I asked about it - she said she just hasn't been happy with how her sandwich tastes the past few times we've been to Lake Mead.  Alas, our shopping tour took us closer to the Lake Mead location and she said it would be fine - so we ended up there.  I ordered by sandwich name and made sure I saw the prep get started before heading for the pickup counter.  We got home and when we opened the sandwich - they'd left of the lettuce completely and there was about a teaspoon of avocado on it.  Actually, that's being too generous ... I took a photo and it's probably about half a teaspoon.  So that does it for me.  My love of Jimmy John's will definitely keep me going back - but we'll never again be able to visit the Lake Mead Parkway location.  Trust me when I say that you are MUCH better off going to the Sunset location for the best sandwich brand on the planet, in my humble opinion!"}
{"text":"My Jimmy John's addiction is one I hope I never break.  We always get the #12 (turkey) and the #13 (veggie) sandwiches and they've never disappointed...EVER.  I don't know what kind of crack they put in the mayo, but it's something awesome, that's for sure.  The bread is outstanding and we've even bought the day-old a few times and brought it home to put in the freezer.  Awesome to make garlic bread for pasta dishes with!  The service at every JJ's is always great (barring one experience at the Lake Mead Parkway location) - but this one is particularly friendly...so even though I have one a little more convenient to me...I'll still go the extra 1/2 mile to my Sunset JJ's 9x out of 10."}
{"text":"Order delivery from this location, and it is always fast and fresh. Never have gotten stale bread. This is my go to work lunch when I can't get away."}
{"text":"Love this place. Blows subway out of the water. Way better quality way better taste. I often go in before work and grab subs for the whole office and I'm in and out in under 10-15 minutes and we're talking sammies for 10 people. The bread is amazing it is my weakness. If you are not a carb lover you can go with the unwich which they will do with any sub they offer and just wrap it in lettuce instead of the delicious crunchy bread."}
{"text":"How does a sandwich shop only have one choice of cheese? They are great for when you don't want to leave the office and you can have them just deliver. But for the price, there are way better options in the area. I have tried a few different sandwiches there, and they all kinda taste the same."}
{"text":"Great food! Polite staff! Called this week to place a detailed order for 12 employees & pick up was ready in 10 minutes & all the orders were spot on!!"}
{"text":"I understand being busy, but when an order is called in, let them know of the delay. We ordered sandwiches and they still have not arrived.....it's been an hour. When I called to ask about our delivery, I was told they were super busy and the driver just left with 4 other orders.  Subs not so fast, but I'm freaking!"}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns. It came to a point where I had Jimmy Johns every night for 2 weeks. The vito is awesome and I love their totally tuna. The bread is what makes the sandwich though and oh man, it is awesome. Jimmy Johns probably has the best sandwich bread that I have ever tasted and I know my sandwiches."}
{"text":"After an entire year of watching my co-workers order and greedily devour their sandwiches from Jimmy John's, I figured I would try to order a Pepe sandwich, as well. - I was not disappointed.   Although it was a rainy day, the delivery guy was on time, friendly, and efficient handling my order. The packaging of the sandwich was clean and neat; the sandwich itself, absolutely delicious. There was a good amount of ingredients on the sandwich, but not so much that it bulged out of the sandwich as is often the case with badly made sandwiches. The ham smelled like it was freshly roasted, and the lettuce, cucumber, and tomato were fresh.   Jimmy John's prices are totally worth it, considering how much Subway charges for a mediocre footlong. JJ also offers a variety of \"freebies\" with an order of their sandwich, which is much appreciated. Overall, I was very impressed."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are just too plain for my taste.  There are better places out there."}
{"text":"This place has super fast service but that is about it.  The bread is terrible.  It is dry and stale.  They also have minimal topping choices.  I would rather wait the extra few minutes at Subway for my sandwich."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns. They have the best subs. I always get the #10 unwhich which is the roast beef without bread. They make just how you want it and they deliver fast."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, done fast. Staff is fun, but they get 'er dun!"}
{"text":"I ordered a simple BLT with avocado.   The sandwich was mostly just bread and the Mayo was extremely heavy.  The bacon was minimal and weird and there was barely any lettuce or avocado. It took over 30 minutes to get it delivered. The guy who took my order took my address incorrectly, so the delivery driver ended up in the wrong place. $13.00 for a sandwich, some chips and an iced tea? I'd AT LEAST expect ingredients on my sandwich."}
{"text":"Delivery comes so fast it really is unbelievable.  Sandwiches are always huge and legit.  A go-to gorge yourself place.  Friendly service and delivery guys.  Their app is also really helpful."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is alright. I'm just not a fan of the menu. Not much of a selection, but if you like what's on the menu, the food is good. Service is good, too."}
{"text":"This JJ's defines my lunch during the workweek; quick, cheap, to-go, online ordering. This location deserves the extra star for staying open on the weekends - something the rest of uptown needs to follow.   The staff here doesn't change too often, so it is nice that they remember the regulars. Be prepared for a line out the door during the week lunch rush. Like other uptown lunch spots, they are prepared for the rush and know how to pump out sandwiches rapidly.   I usually go with the #1 Pepe with bacon. Plenty of customization options available when ordering online.  Bike delivery available for uptown. The delivery people know the city and buildings well, always impressed how quick they show up."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic.. I do not understand the other bad reviews... If you want an AMAZING good quality sandwich to eat and amaze your taste buds, come here. If you want to get entertained then go see a movie.  The other reviewers are silly and not understanding of the menu.  1. Jimmy johns cannot give FREE sides of cheese and avacado, the Chicago style sandwiches are not suppose to even be made with cheese.  2. Why would you care about the people making your food, who cares? You came here to EAT good, affordable food, and you got it.  3.  This isn't a shack, it's just a little space, not a shack, it's enough. They weren't the first restaurant to be placed here, nothing they can do about bad construction from desert ridge market place.  4. Don't give jimmy johns a bad name because you are I'll informed, a fast food sandwich shop is not for entertaining, or anything other than making you GREAT food at a GREAT price.  I love all jimmy johns they are all exactly the same, they are chains, everyone one is gonna have good food, make sure you understand the menu before you order.  I eat at this specific location almost every day, grab my food eat it there in 5 minutes and move on. They also deliver to the immediate area of desert ridge, or you can get it to go.   It is not a sit down restaurant, so don't expect to be waited on.."}
{"text":"I am regular customer.... ordered online at 12:44 p.m. delivery didn't come until 1:17 p.m..... Leaving to a meeting and starved certainly didn't want food that was in a car for 30 minutes. Didn't make sense my why it took so long, my office is literally 2 minutes away."}
{"text":"Before I start, I want to say that I REALLY like Jimmy John's. Their sandwiches are awesome and have great flavor. They are quick and cheap (that's what she said), but this location...I do NOT like.  The food here is on par with the rest of the JJ's, it's the staff at this location that gets me. First of all, if you have a question about something on the menu, they act like your an idiot. Then, when you finish paying, they assume you've never been and rudely tell you to go wait for your sandwich when in reality you're just waiting for them to hand you the drinks you paid for.  I've been in here multiple times when there is music playing, which is fine, except that the music isn't censored. So, if you are planing on bringing your kids here, you should probably be prepared to have them hear some cuss words.  After you get your food, you will probably be able to see the staff all gathered in a circle laughing and conversing as if they were at a bar, instead of actually working like they should be. Honestly, I'm not sure how this location makes money. They would probably do better to hire a couple of efficient people instead of having 5 or 6 inefficient people on staff who do a horrible job.  If you can - go to another JJ's."}
{"text":"If you're hungry, let the neon sign that says, \"FREE SMELLS\" lure you in. The sandwiches are tasty and the service is incredibly fast. By the time I finished paying for my order, my sandwich was already wrapped & ready to go! Maybe it's PMS or maybe it's just me but sometimes I just want a sandwich. Right now."}
{"text":"As close as this location is to where I stay, I had never been to it before.  They weren't as fast to prepare as the one at Baseline and Country Club or the one by Chandler Mall.  I got the Italian and my daughter got the  turkey.  Both were fresh and delicious and a good size for the money, $5.95 each. They only cut the sandwich in half if you request it so my torpedo was whole.  They said it had an oil and vinegar dressing but it was so light as to be indiscernible.  If they had pepperocinis I wasn't aware of it.  The roll was wonderful.   All was fine till I decided it needed a little oomph and went up to the counter to ask for pepper since there were no shakers on the tables.  What? No pepper??  I can't fathom that.  I didn't like the loud music either.  Will I go back? Hell yeah.  But I'll take my own pepper."}
{"text":"We were on our way to Panda Express but spotted this place in the same parking lot and decided to check it out.  They have three categories of sandwiches, $3.50, $4.50 and $5.50.  We each got variations of roast beef sandwiches on 8\" French rolls for $5.50 ea.  Both were delicious.  They make the bread on the premises so it was uber fresh and soft, not leathery like some places.  Absolutely no grisly or chewy spots, every bite tender and easy to chew.  My only complaint is they had no pepperocini and as good as it was it was kind of bland until I followed my daughter's example and put a little mustard on it.    I like that the clerks greeted us as we walked in and answered all my questions cheerfully.  Oh, and the sandwiches were ready before we could step away from the counter, lickety split.  I was surprised when the clerk said they were open till 10pm weeknights, midnight on weekends.  Wow.  Most delis close mid-afternoon.  If you are looking for a healthy, fresh sandwich late at night, this is the place to go.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"ok, I've been to a ton of JJs over the years, and every one I've been to is the same in terms of food. my sandwiches have always been top notch and yeah the staff could be a little friendlier. BUT, the sandwiches come out super fast, and I've never had a problem with getting changes so I'm not sure what the other folks here experienced but it's definitely not consistent with what I have experienced."}
{"text":"My least favorite location so far. I specifically asked for extra ingredients on my sub and somehow the guy only heard 50% of what I said, even though we went into detail explanation about said ingredients. I probably wouldn't be as upset if he choose not to hear the two ingredients they did put on my sub versus the two ingredients they didn't. In essence I paid for something I didn't want. I'm not surprised though, the guy that took my order looked high as hell. Next time I crave Jimmy John's I'll drive to a location that gets my order right."}
{"text":"this is the best sandwich place in world!!! always fresh always on time, staff great. have never had a problem in years I've ordered from them.just tried sandwich on wheat bread for change & it was the bomb!  bread was so thick & tasty! would never ever order from any other sub shop ever."}
{"text":"Solid place for sandwiches.  Usually quick service, they do have delivery as well.  A lot of good options for sandwiches.  Affordable quick lunch."}
{"text":"Always fast and fresh. While not the best sub I've ever had, they are pretty good. I penalized them one star for the service. The people they get to work the register need to exhibit just a smidge of human emotion. You feel like you're being served by zombies. Smile, say hello, be a LITTLE engaging instead of looking at me like I just beat up a bunch of puppies."}
{"text":"This review is actually for the location on 44th street and Thomas Road in Phoenix. For some it doesn't show up on the map when I search it. Anywho, I've had more than one occasion where I've ordered online for \"freaky fast delivery\" and have waited over an hour to receive my sandwich. Sadly I will starve before ordering from that location again."}
{"text":"This location is horrible. First, it took over 40 minutes for my order to come. On the receipt it's says order was received at 6:43. My order didn't arrive to my apartment until 7:22. Second, I added regular Jimmy Johns mustard on my sandwich, there was extra honey Dijon mustard added to my sandwich, in which I hate. Third, the cookie was extremely hard. I will be calling to speak with a manager ASAP"}
{"text":"Always fast, always a perfect sandwich, always friendly.  All Jimmy John's reviews are short because, well, they are consistent and always great."}
{"text":"Excellent subs really fast.  There is a wide variety of light to large, simple to meaty and fulfilling.  One neat option for the health conscious is that they will make any sub in a lettuce wrap instead of bread.  They are always crazy-fast, prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"So, I broke my foot and can't go anywhere so I called jimmy johns to see if they could deliver to me. Anyways, I was barley out of what he called there \"delivery zone\" so I asked nicely well I will pay you more if you could make an acceptation I broke my foot. He then got really pissed like I was out of line for asking such a thing and started getting loud saying he could loose his \"franchise\" then I asked well it's not like your stealing another stores customers your the closest one. Please I broke my foot. He then just flipped it and started just yelling being so rude all cuz I asked nicely if he could do me a favor and I would pay more if he could help me out. I will never go there. Terrible customer service and he was manager. I can understand if you really just can't do it but you don't have to be rude about it."}
{"text":"Fast, clean and fun atmosphere. Kind of sandwich you could whip up at home. Works in a pinch but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and sandwich was fast n tasty as always. I changed some part if the order and the staff was willing to accommodate my request. Ideal location for nice sandwich after late night drinking at state St bars."}
{"text":"The delivery only took about twenty minutes, which is much much better than ordering pizza or Chinese food or anything else. The delivery guy was very sweet and friendly to my dog and the sandwich was super :)  The only thing I wish Jimmy Johns did was make toasted sandwiches an option. Other than that i love it."}
{"text":"Always fast and always friendly.  The employees here have always made my sub quickly and correctly.  The delivery drivers actually run from the store and to their cars.    This place is always clean.  And the employees really do seem to work together which is refreshing to see.  I enjoy the signs that are on the walls and always see something new while I wait for my sub, which is on average is less than a minute.    If you want great subs that you can actually eat with one hand and you need to get in and out quickly, I would definatly recommend this joint."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 subs to go. Came in to pick up, and the guys handed us our subs and told us to bag our own sandwiches! WTF?!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I moved here from Chicagoland and we really missed Jimmy Johns when we first moved here. We were thrilled when they started showing up in Arizona finally.    This has become our normal place for a quick lunch while we are out running errands. We were there on a Wednesday afternoon and yes, it was packed but we were still able to find a table inside and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Friend and I went last week and I had the turkey and cheese on their square sandwich bread (don't know the name of it) and I was quite surprised how good it was. The staff was nice also."}
{"text":"Snoop dog and the crew were awesome. Best experience at a jimmy Johns even though it was close to closing time they were right on top of everything. Before I could even swipe my card to pay my sandwich was done."}
{"text":"Food has always been good, fresh. The selection isn't quite what I prefer but what they serve is good. The staff here, late Saturday night, was fun and enjoyable."}
{"text":"We stopped by this afternoon for two subs. Everyone in this place was either greeted us or thanked us for our business! The entire staff here was very friendly and seemed to work great as a team. They actually did a team \"cheer\" in the short time we were there. Great experience!"}
{"text":"In one of the most ridiculous customer services I have ever experienced, I went into this Jimmy Johns and ordered a small sub with ham cheese and mustard. They told me they couldn't put the mustard on for me but could give me a packet and I could put it on. Had something to do with a stupidly configured menu. Can't really tell if the food is any good as I walked out yelping the nearest subway where they will make your sandwich any way you want."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's.  Jimmy John's is my sub sandwich shop of choice.  I love the insanely fast service and the mind-blowingly delicious bread and fixings.  That is why I dropped by here on my most recent visit for a quick lunch before driving 4 hours back home.  Speed was not this location's problem.  Nor was space.  They were both efficient and huge with about 8 people working.  Granted, they were not really busy when I stopped in.  I got my 'usual.'  That is, a #2 (roast beef) with hot peppers, easy on the mayo.  Not difficult, to be certain, and MAJORLY delicious.  In about 30 seconds, my sandwich was handed to me.  I sat down, unwrapped it, and was treated to what can only be described as a wet sub.  Wet.  Mayo was dripping out of the corners, but not because there was too much...but because it was wet.  Wet with what, I'm not sure.  I think perhaps they didn't shake the vinegar off the hot peppers, or didn't squeeze the lettuce properly or something.  It was pretty gross and I was pretty disappointed.  Also, most of the tables still had crumbs and refuse all over them.  There were about 3 customers in this enormous place, and 8 workers.  To me, those tables could definitely have been cleaned in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Standard Jimmy johns. Only they seem not to want to deliver straws with those orders even when you ask. Good luck."}
{"text":"I'm still on the fence when it comes to JJ's. Sometimes I get a sandwich I really enjoy and other times it is just mediocre. When they are on point it is much better than the other chain sandwich shops that have been around so I keep coming back here. I like the fact that the offer the \"Un-Wich,\" I really like their bread but I do not eat bread that much so this option where the meats are wrapped in lettuce works out perfectly. The staff is always friendly and the order is usually ready once you pay and fill up your drink."}
{"text":"Decided to go here instead of my normal Chipotle fix. I had the roast beef and turkey club.,it was loaded with lettuce and tomato but definitely not eat. Just a few slices of each and maybe cheese. It was hard to tell under all he veggies. The bread was really tasty, seemed fresh! The  sandwich, chips and a drink was just over $9. A bit pricey for what you get. There are some other sandwich shops motto far from here that have better food at a better price. It seems this store just opened. The staff was friendly and the food is prepared super fast. I will give it another trying few weeks to see if this was just a new opening hiccup."}
{"text":"Took them over an hour to deliver 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks today. First call I made was 25 min after I placed my order and the rude lady said, \"we sending it out now. Is that alright with you??\" This was said with an attitude like it was a bother for me to call and check on my order. Second time I called was almost 30 min after my first call. The delivery driver said,\" I just got back from my break. It will take another 10 min for me to get there.\"  Slowest Jimmy John's EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"The few locations I've been to have been pretty consistent, and this one is no different. Their sandwiches are fast, cheap, and to the point. They have a ton of employees, so the food is passed down the assembly line in an efficient fashion. The menu, with all its creative monikers and such, really just comes down to choosing your vegetables and meat and finding the combination that you want (or customize it). No matter what you get, the subs are some of the best that you'll find in the area."}
{"text":"I went into Jimmy Johns last night with a fairly large order. I've only been to Jimmy John's a few times and am not completely familiar with the menu. As I walked in the guys working there got up from the table they were sitting at and a short guy with a beard came to help at the register. I began to order and he frequently interrupted me saying I wasn't being clear and that I'm not understanding the menu. His coworkers attempted to help me by telling me what sandwiches closely matched my order but he continued to be unclear and rude. I asked for an italian and he suggested a turkey sandwich, I've never gotten an italian so I said okay expecting that a guy who works in a sandwich shop would know the ingredients on a popular type of sandwich, but no. I eventually told him to type whatever he wanted because he was being so incredibly rude I couldn't even get a word in. I requested pickles as an option on nearly all 10 of the sandwiches I ordered and he told me they dont slice up pickles and that i could \"do it myself\", his coworker offered to slice them up and put them on my sandwiches (noticing my flustered and frustrated demeanor) and the guy working the cashier rolled his eyes at his coworker. Overall, this is one of the worst experiences I've ever had at ANY restaurant and I will not be returning to this Jimmy John's or any Jimmy John's for that matter."}
{"text":"I get hooked on the turkey tom more and more each time I have one! Very nice customer service at this location, (cant say the same for some of the others) and the hubby and 11 year old SSon love the vito.  Good prices :)"}
{"text":"Sandwich was pretty good, the bread made it.  Service sucks, customer service training needed for sure."}
{"text":"I have been to this store in the past and the sandwiches were quite solid, so this poor review is surprising.  And being a hater is not really my style but the truth must be told. A co-worker and I bought a 30 piece tray yesterday to bring lunch to the office for 6 colleagues as a way of saying thanks for all of their hard work recently. Unfortunately, the sandwiches were spindly and sad.  Very little meat and cheese, gobs of mayo, and overall the most pathetic sandwiches I have seen this side of a prison vending machine.  They were so skinny and wimpy, I kept opening the sandwich to see if anything was in there. It kind of reminded me of being on a field trip in Kindey Garden and they hand out sac lunches with some sad vacant sandwiches that have been smushed under 80 other sac lunches.  The sandwiches were so anemic, I felt like I now have to go buy lunch for my colleagues AGAIN to prove I wasn't trying to insult them by feeding them those skinny-ass, wish sandwiches.   And they put onions on the sandwiches which we specifically requested be excluded.  It must have been the person making trays just throws them together.  Very disappointing.  The only redemption of the poor sandwiches was it becoming a topic of humor and ridicule during lunch and provided for quite comedic relief during lunch.  #JJpleasehaltscrewingyourtraycustomers"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery, the delivery was quick and my order was almost perfect, hence the 4 and not 5 stars. I asked to have my sandwich cut in half and mayo packets, neither of which were executed. Sandwich was still delicious and everything else was accurate! Love how fast the delivery is!"}
{"text":"I have never had worst customer service in my life. I ordered a sandwich and a hour later it still has not arrived. I received a call, I would say 15  minutes after I order from the delivery guy saying he could not find my place. I tried calling him back and it was a international number. I called Jimmy Jonhs again, spoke with the manager and he said he could not get a hold of him either. I called back 1 hour from ordering and asked the manager what was going on and he said the guy was heading back out to my place. I asked him if he was going to charge me for the sandwich and he replied \"yes it already went through and if you don't want it I can cancel your order \". He proceeded to say \"it was my fault because his delivery person could not find my house and I did not answer the phone(remind you I called right back but it was international and I was not going to pay for a phone call to the delivery guy)\". I ask him for his franchise owners number and his name and he refused to give it to me and told me now I was upsetting him. I called him a choice name ...told him to cancel my order and I will be calling corporate. Then I get a call from the delivery person stating he has arrived. Remind you this is now  a hour and 15 minutes after I ordered. I explained to the delivery guy I canceled my order and told him the story. He let me know his phone died  and he had to borrow a phone(which was international) that is why I could not get a hold of him!!!  Ridiculous...this manager needs to be FIRED and I will make sure my office does not order from THIS Jimmy Johns again!!! Does this immature manager realize the customers are the ones paying his check and a mistake that was so OBVIOUSLY their fault... the least they could do is give a free $6 sandwich!!! POOR POOR SERVICE! I ordered from the one on Apache and they were EXCELLENT and  gave me corporates number 217-356-9900."}
{"text":"Very clean and very fast. Yes, Freaky Fast. Unfortunately there's nothing special about their taste. I ordered a Lulu sans tomato which is turkey, bacon and lettuce. I didn't know I could add other things to the sandwich. Would have been nice had the clerk asked me although it is my responsibility so I take the blame. My sandwich looked more like a salad in bread than a cold cut lunch. (See picture) Reminds me of a famous 1980s commercial \"Where's the beef?\"  The only thing that stood out was the jalapeño chips which were spectacular! Food wasn't gross, it just happen to be very bland."}
{"text":"Dear Jimmy John's,  I love you.    Don't take that lightly.  My heart means a lot.  No wait, where are you going?  Wait, hear me out, please?  You're from Illinois.  I'm from Illinois.  And yet?  Here we are, out for fun with friends in Vegas.  Who's to say what could happen.  Your sandwiches are divine.  You keep your shop clean, and your staff is AMAZING.  You always leave me happy and fulfilled.  Thank you.  PS - You should REALLY consider moving to California.  I could make it worth your while."}
{"text":"Not really sure what happened here.  I have ordered from other Jimmy John's location with no problem at all, and have ordered from this one with no issues at least once that I can remember.  Today was just a mess.  Ordered around noon for delivery between 2:15 and 2:30.  At 2:20 I saw that my order was not out for delivery yet.  No big deal, they are usually very fast, but I called just to make sure that it was on its way.  I was told that the driver had a couple of deliveries just before mine but that it would be to me soon.  Awesome, no problem.    2:45 rolls around, no food.  Since my lunch is about to be over I call again.  The person who answered the phone was the same person as before and seemed surprised that I had not received my food yet.  They were very apologetic and offered to credit my account.  I do understand that things happen and was appreciative of that offer.  I check the app a few minutes later and it has updated that my order is out for delivery...as of 2:43, which was right when I called the second time.  Convenient.    My order FINALLY arrives at 3:18, a full hour past the start of the delivery window.  The delivery driver was apologetic and said that they had a rush and got swamped, but both calls I made to the store gave me no indication that there was any reason my order should have taken that long.    Love the food and the staff was kind and apologetic through out my wait, but that doesn't change the fact that there was a huge disconnect and failure to communicate.  Unfortunately this experience will make me hesitant to order from this location in the future."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns but this was the slowest service I've ever gotten. It took almost an hour to get our food and we're across the street from them. Hire more drivers, you advertise how fast you are but don't deliver. Incredibly disappointed :("}
{"text":"Not very fast. Been 20 minutes. Normally less than 10 in Phoenix, which is about 30x as large. When you order they just tell you \"as fast as we can\". Every JJ in any other city tells you X minutes. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Great subs,affordable price and good service.My only complaint would be the night club like volume of the music-difficult to place your order!"}
{"text":"If I ate meat, I'm sure I would be a bigger Jimmy Johns fan. But, as it stands, they only have one vegetarian option, which seems sub par for a sandwich shop. The veg sandwich is tasty enough, I like that they have sprouts for the sandwiches, and that you can choose wheat bread instead of the traditional white sub. But there's only one thing I can order on the menu, and this girl likes options! Also, the only 'sides' you can choose from are huge pickles or chips, and I don't care for either. Again, lack of choices. I know it's a chain, and I know plenty of people that really like these sandwiches, I just wish they had more selection for the veg crowd."}
{"text":"Good subs, nice and quick service. Love the ultimate porker"}
{"text":"Jimmy johns has ALWAYS given me a friendly greeting & a correct delicious order. I do wish they extend thir delivery area though because they are my fave and I'm one street out of reach. Thank you jimmy johns"}
{"text":"I have to say.  We order a lot of lunches at work. Normally it takes 30-1 hr for delivery. I ordered jimmy johns and it took less than 15 min.  Wow!!!  That awesome."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been to this new Jimmy John's location.  I thought the first time I went there maybe they were still new and that's why my beach club was missing sprouts...not the case.  Today I ordered a beach club -unwich (hold the bread) and again no sprouts, or really much of anything.. so glad I paid $7.00 for lettuce a slice of turkey and tomatoes...my receipt says beach club...which according to the menu (and every other Jimmy John's I've been to) includes: turkey, cheese,avocado spread, sliced cucumbers, sprouts, lettuce, tomato and mayo.. eh, look at the picture and tell me what you see.  On top of that.. it was definitely not fast and no one was freakin'..more like we were all waiting around wondering when we were gonna get our overpriced, not as advertised sandwich."}
{"text":"I didn't really enjoy it, actually. It was my first time and they were basically giving me that look like why did I even show up if I didn't know what I was doing. Um, isn't that why you go to new restaurants? He did explain to me what they had and things of that nature but it just was very uncomfortable. The sandwich wasn't as I expected."}
{"text":"JIMMY TRASH. The staff is RUDE and when asked if they have smaller sandwiches they said no. They didn't even cut my sandwich in half or offer me a drink!! You would think they were about to close but they had another hour to go! Don't go to this location EVEN IF YOU ARE HUNGRY!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever experienced. The girl taking orders at the front counter didn't even acknowledge my existence when I walked in and didn't say a word the entire time I ordered. This is my second and last time at this Jimmy John's. My sandwich was made quickly but had way too much cheese both times I ordered it. When I tried to take some of the cheese off, I noticed that the guacamole was sandwiched between the cheese so it made it difficult to scrape off. Overall, pretty terrible experience"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this sandwich shop and it will be my last. I have had sandwiches from grocery stores and hospital snackbars that we're better tasting. How does Jimmy John's qualify as a \"gourmet sandwich \" shop? It was lunch time and the restaurant was practically empty and now I know why."}
{"text":"I get deliveries from this location often, they have been perfect since day one. On time, service is great with my clients. Can't ask for anything more"}
{"text":"I love their tuna sandwich, my favorite. Bread smells good, the vegetables are fresh. The best is that it is super quick. Order is ready even before I finish paying"}
{"text":"Average sandwich.  The location seems to be built to serve a highly populated neighborhood.  3 order taking stations in the back and two serving lines.  Yet when I visited, there was no customers    Anyway. Good sandwich. Nothing special that the local shops can't do.  Save a trip here and patronize the little local places that do it better."}
{"text":"3 people standing making sandwiches. Knife laying right there. I asked if they could please cut my sandwich in 1/2. They finished making 3 sandwiches, one person picked up a broom and began sweeping, one answered the phone, and my sandwich is still sitting there. They had put the knife away. I took my sandwich and ripped it in 1/2. Where is customer service??? I paid $10 for a ham sandwich.  They knew I was pissed so apologized and offered me a cookie. No thanks, but that got you a star in your rating"}
{"text":"Oh Jimmy Johns, you chain sandwich place, why oh why do you have to be in my hood!!!! Your free smells entice me your fresh bread delights me, oh I could live on just your bread alone, but now your close to my house and will deliver sandwiches to me, is this heaven or hell!!!!    Yep got me a Jimmy Johns right around the corner from my house now, and though I try to stay out of chain places, but I love love love me some Jimmy Johns!  My daughter and I were starving and didn't feel like making anything so she said lets order some sandwiches and have them delivered, I was like yea, let's see how Fast their Fast is! Ok we ordered 2 Beach clubs & BAM! at my place in less than 10 mins from time we ordered them!    Sandwich was fresh and delish, and didn't disappoint!  Yep I'm a Jimmy Johns fan!"}
{"text":"Oh Jimmy Johns you know I love your fresh bread and when I'm at work and forgot my lunch and craving a sandwich, I just call you and you bring me one, I like our relationship, it's been going good, but last few times you have failed me and left me a little sad  Today I called and ask you for a #12 with no tomatoes (coworker heard great things about and wanted to give you a try) and a #11 with extra Dijon & all the freebies and while the #12 turned out perfect, the 11 was lacking any Dijon and no hot peppers. It was still a great sandwich, just wasn't quite the perfect one. But my coworker did enjoy her #12.  Let's try to mend this relationship the next time I call........"}
{"text":"Freshly baked rolls with great taste and texture.Good quality meats in generous portions.Exceptional condiments such as Jimmy's Mustard & hot peppers.And the sandwich maker took my order as I waited in line.To my pleasant surprise my order was ready by the time I had paid for it.And my order was made correctly.Bravo!"}
{"text":"Yeah, they opened one here.  I have been here 3 times.  AMAZING BLT.  I like it best with extra tomato and mayo. So good!  I love to get the day old bread for 48 cents to make croutons."}
{"text":"The service is very quick and they are very clean. They use gloves when handling all the food. The love their bread its always fresh and warm."}
{"text":"This is the first time I stopped in to eat here. The service is very fast and the sandwiches are great. The sandwiches are made to order and are worth the cost"}
{"text":"This location sucks!!!!! They always get my order wrong!! They are trying too do them too fast that they always get the order wrong..... Never ever ever going back to this location.  You guys suck!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been craving a good roast beef sandwich for a few days now, and finally had the chance to venture out someplace new to fill the near bottomless pit that is my stomach. This afternoon, my quest for a Roast Beef sandwich lead me to Jimmy Johns. And I will resume my search tomorrow, because, frankly, I was far from impressed with JJ's. And almost want my money back.   As stated, I wanted roast beef, and when i walked in and looked at the board, saw, what they have dubbed \"The Hunter's Club,\" a sandwich purporting to have 1/4 lb roast beef, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and provolone. Bingo! That's what I wanted, so that's what I ordered. I rounded out my order with the combo, a medium drink and a bag of chips for 2$ more. Total came to 8 bucks and change for what I assumed would be the large.   Well, its a one size fits all kinda place. Sandwich was barely larger then your standard medium at any other sandwich shop. Also, it wasn't cut in half, which isn't a big deal, but what I assumed was standard operating procedure for anything larger than a \"small\" is to cut the damned thing in half so you don't poke someone in the face with the far end of your unwieldy edible. I ripped it in half myself, and when I went to get napkins, well, there weren't any to be seen. Had to ask at the counter for a couple. The girl gave me 1.   Anyway, the sandwich. When I ripped it in half, I noticed that there was more lettuce than anything in the sandwich, and when I bit into it, my suspicions were confirmed. I was eating a Lettuce, Tomato, Provolone and Mayo sandwich. Oh, there was roast beef on there, but you could barely tell. I couldn't, to be honest. It was magical, my eye's said \"Hey look! Roast Beef! We Have Roastbeef!!!\" by my tongue said \"WTF Eyes, are you kidding me? There's no roastbeef here! Trust me, i'm swirling around the damn product and can't tell its there! It's a monstrosity of Mayo, Lettuce, more Mayo, and Lettuce, and what I assume to be cheese! You lie, Eyes! You Lie!\" Totally dejected and disappointed, I finished my near 9 dollar, 8 inch lettuce sandwich, and delved into the chips.   Chips, can't screw those up, right? Right. Well, maybe kinda. JJ has their own house chips, highly reminiscent of the Kettle Chips. Not bad, just really really REALLY salty. Caked in salt. I have no problem with salt, chips should have salt on them. That's fine by me, I enjoy me my salty chips. But this was like a salt lick. I'm sure some people enjoy them, but not my cup of tea. Speaking of cup of tea, that's what I had to drink. Lipton brewed Iced Tea. Best part of the meal, aside from leaving. And determining not to go back.   They deliver as well, proudly stating they will deliver even 1 sandwich. Silvermine does it. Cheba Hut does it. Dilly's Deli does it. Congrats, you've joined the guild of delivery sandwich shops, all of whom will deliver 1 sandwich.   Come here only if you're a fan of generic, near tasteless food, that's over priced."}
{"text":"The employees are very friendly.  The store is small but a little dirty.  I was very disappointed that the sandwich was super thin:  3 maybe 4 thin slices of meat and 2 slices of cheese.  And it was bland.  I could have made that sandwich in my kitchen with cold cuts.  So not worth it!"}
{"text":"These guys are consistent, convenient and reliable enough for me to have eaten myself sick of them...for now. A star rating is lost to a couple order errors."}
{"text":"First off nothing gourmet going on here at all. Its basically Subway with free delivery and they have to deliver it for free or there is no way in hell you would bother with the place. It's cheap, generic, flavorless food."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of Jimmy John's and I still won't order food here. However, my husband loves it so one day I stopped and picked him up some lunch. They were incredibly fast at getting my order made. I was in and out within 3 minutes probably."}
{"text":"This location NEVER gets the order right. And it's not complicated. Every time I ask them to add something to what already comes on the veggie club sandwich, I end up only with what I asked to add. So basically a pickle and cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"Do not order for delivery from this location. This is the second time I've ordered from here and have waited an hour and a half for my food..."}
{"text":"The food taste fresh and delicious. The prices are reasonable and the portion of the food is generous. As for the service it was great. I place an order for delivery, and it was deliver within 10 minutes. Their website is also very easy to navigate and to place an order. I definitely recommend this place for lunch."}
{"text":"Crazy busy lunch!  Super fast. Keep in mind there are white bread rolls baked there on site...Yes, the ones you don't want to admit you came in contact with due to dietary restrictions.  Just DO IT.  There is super high calorie thick sliced wheat bread, if that makes you feel any better.   And it is totally good!!!!  Leave the thick spread of mayo on the high calorie bread and enjoy.  All you could with for is mac and cheese as a side dish! I give 5 stars because they ONLY have provolone cheese and have guac! Ya, you can choose lower calorie if you take time, but what fun is that????"}
{"text":"I would give it zero stars if I could... I ordered 2 sandwiches and called 20 minutes later to ask where my delivery was and was told that it's on its way. Jump to another 15 minutes later it arrived.  Both sandwiches are warm and messed up.  I will not order Jimmy Johns again!  BTW, this isn't the 1st episode. Freaky fast delivery, bullshit."}
{"text":"This Jimmy John's was an oasis in a series of blocks of generic fast food places. I told my friend to make a crazy turn as soon as I saw it.  We ran inside, and I know this sounds silly, but the people who work here were really so nice. I didn't feel like it was cheesy or corporate or whatever. The sandwich, a #5, was impeccably made and delicious!"}
{"text":"Super fast delivery! Food is delish! I'll look for Jimmy John's over other ordinary places next time!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 grinders online, very convenient - able to choose a time.  One was lettuce for the bread, roast need, cheese tomato and cucumber with an avocado spread.   Other was a colossal , but nothing colossal about it. Looked like a normal grinder, cheese turkey tomato cucumber, it was not HUGE like you would think it would be with the name.  Got pickles, which were great, can't mess up those much :). Drinks and a cookie.  First time here tonight, personally don't think we will return since It Was nothing out of the ordinary.  The associate there was very friendly though! Even called when I was on my way since I was running behind my pick up time."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this location on March 21st around 8:00 pm. My husband ordered the Billy Club and I ordered the Vito. Both of our sandwiches were prepared using freshly baked french sub bread and plenty of meat, provolone, tomatoes, sprouts, onions, peppers, shredded lettuce, mayo and Grey Poupon. I had oregano, vinegar and oil added to mine to top it off.  The sandwiches were the best we have had to date at a Jimmy John's. The workers there are nice and friendly, this location has plenty of seating, its clean and brightly lit. I also have to add the Jimmy John's Chips are crunchy and flavorful and adds to the sandwich eating experience. Their prices are reasonable considering it is a loaded sandwich with all of our favorite toppings.  I recommend this location--its worth the drive or if you are in the area be sure to visit."}
{"text":"Did not eat inside, but had a quick and pleasant drive thru experience.  I didn't even know they had a drive thru, so it was a nice surprise.  It's difficult to bring two little ones into restaurants when I just want to pick up lunch quickly.  We appreciated the quality of the sandwiches, the upbeat friendliness of the employee, and the speed in getting our order."}
{"text":"If you ask for your sandwich to be cut in half you should probably go to Subway because you're more than likely a pedophile and an asshole."}
{"text":"They all of a sudden stop delivering 1.5 miles away ughk, waste of offering delivery if you can't travel at least 2miles. Guess I'll drive to subway."}
{"text":"Jimmy johns. Always fast. If you frequent a location they may have your sandwich made and on the counter by the time you pay, and the line is not long and moves fast. These guys are all speed. Great for lunch if you are in a big hurry. Try the number 10. That's my favorite"}
{"text":"How could a place with such pedestrian ingredients churn out a sandwich of such deliciousness?  If I were to hold a competition for the most exceptional plain sandwich - the sandwich that would be the benchmark for the sandwiches of the world, this would be it.  You're looking at lettuce, tomato, cheese and protein on a roll.  That's it.  Sprouts, mayo and dressing are about as crazy as you're gonna get.  And yet, your roast beef and turkey are tender and well-seasoned, your hero roll pliant and slightly buttery, the absolute perfect amount of lettuce, tomato and sprouts for the perfect crunch.  You're good, Jimmy Johns.  You're surprisingly good.  Now given that I have a limited amount of time and stomach space for the foods of the world and that I'm typically looking for exceptional dishes to challenge and grow my palette, it irks me a bit that I would truly love a plain jane sandwich such as this.  And yet, I return for that Hunter's Club time and time again.  Thumbs up - I have no qualms with the simple joys of your menu."}
{"text":"Jimmy johns. Always fast when you are in a hurry. The number 10 hunters club is my recommendation. They have good kettle cooked chips too. Read some of the signs while you are eating"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are the bomb.  But, they don't deliver south of Thunderbird, which is about a mile south.  The Jimmy John's on Shea & Scottsdale Road doesn't deliver north of Sweetwater.  I've heard other customers complaining about this.  If they would deliver between Thunderbird and Scottsdale, they would get a lot more business."}
{"text":"Let's say worst Jimmy's ever!  I place an order online and my gf goes into get it, she comes out with half of it and says that's all that they gave me.  I'm like, wtf?!  We go back in and they act like they don't know what we're talking about.  Finally we get our drink cups and chips.  Why order ahead if stuff isn't going to be ready guys?!  That was the whole point!  We were in a hurry!    Bad experiences make for never return customers.  This will be an easy choice with five Guys right next door!"}
{"text":"Go to any other location!  This one is the worst ever!  40 minutes to wait to get the wrong order delivery and then find out that they can't be bothered to bring a damn straw.  Ugh!  At least they refunded the money."}
{"text":"So, I literally haven't been on Yelp in over a year because of how rarely I write reviews, but I did find it necessary to write one about this Jimmy Johns location today. My partner and I never go to Jimmy Johns because they never get my order right even though it's very simple. Gave it a shot to see if there was any improvement and it was the SAME experience.   We go through the drive thru and verify our order THREE times because of how hard it was to hear the employee. Got home and my sandwich is missing the salami that I made sure he understood I wanted; but they made sure they charged me for it! *eye roll* bye jimmy johns."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick sandwich. Service was friendly and efficient. Sandwich was tasty, but they charge for extra anything. Better veggie option than Subway."}
{"text":"The food taste great but the sub was very skimpy I ask for extra lettuce I got very very little lettuce and it was minus the tomato on my sandwich they did get that right I go to other Jimmy Johns and Parma and Middleburg never have an issue this location in Strongsville twice now I've had an issue. Just want to let other people that love Jimmy Johns no don't go to Strongsville and I did call them to let them know they just said OK will let the manager know"}
{"text":"I'm in a wheelchair and was too lazy to come out in the rain so I ordered from my Mustang!! Ordered a big john , chips and a diet coke. ( trying to watch my girlish figure )  Delivery. Was fast and efficient!!  Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"I came here once and ordered the vegetarian and I can tell you it will be the last time I eat here. The sandwich was borderline inedible. It was essentially just a pile of mayo on white bread, just a few shreds of iceberg and a little tomato. I didn't see any of the avocado that was supposed to be on it and I asked for sprouts which weren't included either. Sent it back, they added the sprouts and avocado but it was still a sad excuse for a sandwich."}
{"text":"I went to Jimmy John's for the first time tonight. I ordered online and when I got there, my food was ready and prepared correctly. The young man at the register was very friendly and the restaurant was clean. I enjoyed the sub but I felt like I was tasting more vegetables than meat, so it would have been better if there was a better meat to vegetable ratio. I would definitely return to try more options."}
{"text":"Always amazing service. The staff is friendly, professional and pays attention to detail each time I place my orders. Super clean establishment. Love their sandwiches and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had Jimmy Johns delivered today from this location.  Loved the food, but not the smell of Marijuana on my drink and bag.  Great job delivery driver."}
{"text":"Was so excited to have a Jimmy Johns close to our house!  We've been big JJ fans for years. Needless to say, we were disappointed with this new location. They scoop the bread out& fill it with tons of lettuce. The amount of meat is ridiculously minimal. We also could not get a side of peppers due to overhead! Never heard of a sub restaurant being so CHEAP. Maybe they were saving up to buy the new patio furniture they put out in the new outdoor eating area. If this place wants to last in Summerlin they better get with the program & give the customers their money's worth."}
{"text":"So I am writing this AS I am eating my first ever Jimmy John's sandwich.  This is NOT what I was expecting, the sandwich looks like a sandwich my mom made (with love of course).  I ordered a Slim Turkey Breast sandwich, it came on 9 grain wheat sliced bread - that's IT! No mustard, mayo, lettuce, tomato, nothing!   I asked for extra mayo & mustard packets but didn't get them. Turns out, I don't need them, this sandwich is amazing just the way it is it's 'ol plain self !  LOTS of mean and the bread is amazing!  I mean I wouldn't 'not' eat it if it did have mayo, mustard, lettuce and tomato on it, but it's not bad the way it is.  It got here UBER fast!! Like in less than 8 minutes !  The delivery guy was super friendly.  In all I ordered a Slim Turkey Breast sandwich, Jimmy Chips, and a chocolate chip cookie and my total was $8.27, add a $1.75 delivery fee and a $2 tip and my total total was $12.68, if you look at it that way, it's a little much for what I got, but in a bind, I'll take this over traditional fast food any day!       I'll be back!  Ok so here I am again, it's 1/25/2017 and I just had another JJ sandwich, can these guys be any nicer ??  OMG the sandwich was amazing, again, but this time the delivery driver, I want to say he said his name was Devon (sounded like Da-von) was sooooo super nice and polite !    Whatever this company is teaching it's employees on Customer Service, pretty much ALL other restaurants need to be teaching this too, except for In N Out Burger, they already have it down!   Ima fan !!!"}
{"text":"Wow, this Jimmy John's is awesome!  Ordered online and decided to go for delivery.  The whole process was so simple and easy I might just be doing this more often.  It literally took 5min from the point I ordered to when I had my sub. I couldn't believe how fast it was, I couldn't have got there faster in my car.  Delivery came by bike messenger, sandwich intact and picture perfect.  Great taste and best process!"}
{"text":"You know we love the Sandwiches here, and the People who work their are always very nice and friendly... However yesterday was a bit different.. Food was great, Music was fun, but the gal at the register taking our order was not very friendly at all. In fact it was so weird that compared to everyone else, she was so out of place with her customer service, that she may have just been having a really bad day so far.... And it just wasn't with us, she was taking Drive thru orders and if I was on the other end, I would have just driven away..."}
{"text":"I went for the first time today and this place is really great. And I've been to a lot of restaurants in this area, since I have a job that gives me paid lunches. This is a good place if you want subs or clubs in a casual, clean environment. My food was ready as soon as my transaction went through and I was in the middle of getting my fountain drink. They're very quick about things. I've also checked out their website because you can order online for delivery, and I've got to say, any website that tells me the nutritional facts right there as soon as I choose an item...I give that restaurant a thumbs up.  This place ROCKS. I plan to go again tomorrow, since they told me their tuna is awesome."}
{"text":"Used to like this place a lot, the sandwiches are pretty good if they make them right and the drivers that delivered the food were real friendly. Last few times they've either messed up my order or I've had bad customer service. So here it is Sunday night at 930, the only place around that delivers is jimmy johns. Gave it another try and it's actually freaky how fast I don't wanna order from here anymore."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks back, maybe 2 or 3, I ordered some sandwiches from this location on my sandwich I ordered avacado spread which cost me 75 cents extra. When my sandwiches were delivered low and behold there was no spread on my sandwich. I called the manager whose name was Devlin and told him what had happened. He apologized, asked if I wanted him to send another sandwich out, it was already around 8pm so I told him no I was just going to eat it and he said he would put a note in my order so the next time I ordered I wouldn't have to pay for the spread which was fine, I just didn't want to pay for something I didn't get. I called in today to order another sandwich and explained to the girl Lizz who took my order the situation and she assured me it would be no problem she would tell her manager and they would take care of it. Well,  I hour my sandwich with no spread so I called back and spoke to the manager Kelsey who told me there were no notes in my order and obviously Devlin did not do his job and there was nothing she could do to right their mistake. It's 75 cents mind you, 75 measly cents. I've since filed a report to corporate and asked Kelsey to come get her $10 sandwich. What a joke. Tidbit, jersey Mikes is way better and across the street. Customer service people look it up. I wasn't asking for something for nothing, I just wanted what I paid for."}
{"text":"Worst sandwich shop in town. You cannot build your own sandwich you have to pick a number off the menu. They made the sandwich wrong and they wanted to charge me for the right one . First time to Jimmy Johns last time to Jimmy Johns won't be returning. 0 stars I don't see how their going to stay open for much longer with bad service no cars in the parking lot. Jimmy would be upset."}
{"text":"Freaky fast??? I ordered from my work less than a mile away, it took over a half an hour to get my food! Bacon was flimsy and didn't seem cooked. Won't be going or ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I have always loved Jimmy John's. In fact, I used to drive quite a ways to go there. The ingredients are SO fresh compared to other sub shops. That's one main draw, the freshness. I had lunch there with my son yesterday. He can usually eat a full 12\" from [the competition], but after eating only an 8\" Vito, no chips, he said he was full. I told him it's because they use real food.  Service: Outstanding!! Seriously. Couldn't be better.  So, why not 5 stars? One of the reasons I used to drive so far to JJ's was because of the sprouts. I. Love. Sprouts. Please bring back the sprouts. You're still the best sub shop, better with sprouts!"}
{"text":"Haven't had any issues here. Saw some negative reviews of this place but personally I think it's spot on for the type of experience you'd expect from a JJ's. Fast and tasty. Maybe not the most personable cashier but they aren't why I go there so that doesn't bother me. They're right across the street from my office so I haven't had them deliver yet but in the past JJ's is always freaky fast ... It's insane."}
{"text":"The hard part about this is that the sandwich is not bad. I don't really like ordering at sub places I admit it like Subway. I ordered one finally and the two workers there with no one else in there barely did anything. It was as if he did not want to do anything. So he made the sub without asking me anything. I did say as much. They acted as if they could not hear me. Then of course, I think they did. They got the manager over and he also just stood there mainly. I had to ask for napkins. It is just annoying like pulling teeth. Also when I went in he called me ma'm in a surly way that annoyed me and I don't like it anyway. I said not to call me that and then he did again anyway.That is what they have been doing. After I noticed he had left the lettuce off. I had looked at it but I had not thought of it then. It is just annoying if you paid for it. That is what they have been doing there.   It is not the greatest sandwich. Phoenix people don't expect much. When I was in Chicago I had a good one. I thought they must have inspired them there. This was not good. So I think it is maybe too annoying to go back then. There is not much to go to in downtown Phoenix on Sat. The funny thing is I kind of knew someone working there not really knowing him."}
{"text":"Food freshness is great!  Staff is ok....    I wish they were a little more explanatory with what does and does not come one the sandwich.  I know it has a menu board; however; somethings need to be explained.    If I want mustard instead of mayo on a sandwich I do not want yellow mustard packets.  If my sandwich is already wrapped you have permission to unwrap and add mustard for me."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times before. In my opinion it's a great place if your in a hurry. I love how fast they work. there's always  3 or 4 people doing the work of 1 or 2. I've often sat and wondered about this and I think it's a gimmick that shifts the focus away from the actual taste.   The taste of the hoagie is fair. I've had better but it's done so fast that it's worth it...? If it weren't for the speed of preperation and the cookies I would go 3 stars. As it sits,  I LIKE not love this place.  great college food."}
{"text":"Food was good but workers kept clowning around. If they would shape up they would get five stars not three"}
{"text":"Tasty sandwiches and fast delivery! You can't go wrong with Jimmy Johns when you want food and you are in a pinch!"}
{"text":"WORST customer service ever. The manager, if he was a manager, that I spoke to on the phone was rude, short and failed to provide any compensation for the order that THEY got wrong. DO NOT go to this location... the lack of customer service alone makes me wish I could give them less than one star rating. The \"manager\" I spoke to had zero care, zero concern, zero professionalism and zero management skills. Any other place would have apologized and at minimum offered something free on my next order. All he offered was, I can't help you unless you bring the sandwich back to the store. This offer came after I explained to him I was on my lunch and just can't leave the office again. Told him I'd never order from them again, he said... \"thats fine, no problem. Thank you for calling\" them basically hung up. Just his attitude alone will make me call their corporate office. He should NOT be in any form of customer service."}
{"text":"In and out in less than five minutes!!  Love this sandwich shop - especially because it is close to my office.  I have only tried two sandwiches - the Pepe and the Turkey Tom.  For $5.15 it is a nice big sandwich.  Very soft bread and super fresh ingredients.  They have chips and drinks and cookies and extras for you also.  Love coming here - thanks Jimmy Johns!!  :-D"}
{"text":"Talk about freaky fast! From the time I ordered to having both sandwiches, drinks and chips delivered in hand was approximally 10 minutes. I cannot believe it. This is about as convenient as you can ever wish for. Service was super friendly. Well worth the price for this speedy convenience.  Three stars for the food, five stars for the convenience of quick delivery."}
{"text":"Fast, quick, fresh and friendly service for a somewhat bland product. The staff becomes a bit discombobulated if you make changes to the preset menu."}
{"text":"I went into the office and I was starving .. students were piling into the door and taking their seats and I needed something to eat fast because I had skipped breakfast to coach my sons football game .. no way I could I skip lunch too!  I went online and ordered from Jimmy Johns store on W. Elliot in Tempe and WOW!  Talk about 'freaky-fast'!  That sandwich showed up in zero seconds flat!  Freaky-freaky-freaky-fast!  Great job Jimmy, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I live in Hudson as well but I just drive there as Hudson is only 5x5 miles with jimmy johns in the middle so I assume mr. 'Really' entitled lives over rt 8 and doesn't think the rules of delivery areas apply to him.  My son loved the gargantuan and I drive the distance a lot to pick it up, very friendly and fast staff.  When they say fast they aren't kidding, clean as well and  Without crying about where my house is located the food is great."}
{"text":"Open until 12 midnight, but they apparently pre-close early according to the manager that I called at 11:57pm when the door was locked.  I saw 3 other cars pull up before closing as well and we all had to go to Whataburger since Jimmy Johns lies about their hours!!!"}
{"text":"Let's get real. Work can be crazy hectic. In fact, there are lots of times where I can't even begin to entertain the idea of a sit down lunch. This is where my hero, Jimmy Johns, comes to my rescue. For example, today I'm playing catch up from vacation and I didn't pack my lunch box (silly me). I don't want to go grab something today (today is one of those countless hectic days)- Why you ask?  Most of my time will be gobbled up driving to and fro to fetch something to chow down on. The beauty of Jimmy J is that I can sit in the comfort of my humble cube and order my sandwich with the greatest of ease -- online. You can even save your favorite order to enhance your timesavings. I truly can't think of another spot that is more efficient, tasty, fresh,  and consistent as Jimmy Js. They truly live up to their slogan of \"Freaky Fast\"- for sure. I placed my order and I had my sandwich and pickle in hand within 15/20mins. The ease of ordering online is great- you can order a sandwich/unwhich (Lettuce Wrap for the low carb/paleo fans) and it comes with everything I want or don't want. They're awesome!  Bonus: I order online 9 times out of 10. However, I've visited this location a handful of times and the staff is super outgoing and welcoming everytime. Love this location and will continue to order from here/ visit this location in the future."}
{"text":"I've visited this location at least 5 times since it opened. Each time, my order has been made wrong. They always leave something off, or add something I wanted left off. I went yesterday and was surprised to take a bite and hit a giant shard of sharp hard plastic on my teeth and against my cheek. I'm extremely disappointed as I have visited other locations and had no issues. I'm not sure why this location can't seem to get it together."}
{"text":"Had The 8\" big John.  Rare Roast Beef was very good, lettuce was cold in the sandwich good amount of mayo, not Their best sandwich, altogether."}
{"text":"The Short of it: Sub-Way with better bread.  The Long of it: this location has a cramped space. Their assembly line style doesn't seem to lend itself to any faster service but it does create many mistakes. They have gotten my order wrong about 3 times (probably for the last time).  Ordering it on line didn't make it much better or save me any time getting back to work. On the plus side; it is clean and the food is fresh if lacking in flavor.  It's a little bit overrated. But if you want a little step up or change of pace from Subway and can't do without a sandwich it will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Jimmy John's to arrive in Arizona for soooo long!  This was one of my favorite spots for lunch when I lived in Chicago. Close to the office, quick service, friendly employees and great subs for a chain restaurant.  We were initially headed to Five Guys in the same plaza, but after seeing the menu we headed over to Jimmy John's and I'm so glad we did. The employees are friendly, my Italian Sub was delicious and the place was bustling.   This place stands head and shoulders above the other chain sub competition."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Sandwich was very plain, not much flavor. I found it to be a bit over priced considering the quality of the food. Service was very fast but it showed to be half fast by the quality of the sandwich I received. Won't return back to this place again. I personally prefer cappriotis over jimmy johns."}
{"text":"I've always heard great things about Jimmy John's but since they never had any in CA, I never got to try. On a recent trip to vegas, I tried them and got the vito. It was $5, 8 inches and had fresh Italians meats, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and zesty italian dressing. It tasted great! I was really impressed, for a $5 sandwich, this was awesome. I also found out they recently opened one in Pasadena. I'm going there next!"}
{"text":"Saw the low rating and hesitated.. glad we didn't! Delicious fresh sub- unlike other sub places Jimmy John'a had quality bread- not cheap soggy bread. Fresh ingredients- real turkey - not processed. Clean place with friendly staff.. highly recommend for a quick lunch stop!"}
{"text":"I have ordered takeaway from this location many times and they never disappoint. I once timed that it took 14 mins from the time I submitted my online order to the time of delivery - and during a snowstorm! Very impressive staff, especially on a college campus"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful! I can't tell which was worse... the hour long wait for our food or the excruciating pain that was inflicted once the food poisoning set in. Never mind, I'm pretty sure curled up in the fetal position with agonizing pain was the winner. I will NEVER eat here again. I am deeply saddened. I use to love eating at Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"Been to this location before and I was being handed my sandwich by the time I paid and picked out my chips. Super friendly and attentive employees."}
{"text":"I love JJs, so the 2* is for this location only. We have been here 3 times. The first time they said they couldn't use the chip in our card, ok that's fine. The 2nd time we went we used cash. The lettuce was kind of old and the meat had a bad smell. We went back a few months later and they said we had to enter a pin for our credit card chip. When my husband told them there is no pin cause it's a credit card the guy told my husband he was wrong. We have had the same card for 2 years and have never been asked for a pin. That's the last time we will go to this location."}
{"text":"First and last at this location. How is it possible that I'm willing to pay for a $8 sandwich and I can't order it without bread? Really? I didn't want it the bread to go to waste, I was raised to never throw away food. Staff not very understandable and said that it was policy. Alrighty then. Ill take myself to another place where I can pay and order what my little heart desires without having to waste and throw away food."}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of Billy Clubs to be delivered but there were a few issues and they weren't prompt.  But Austin made it right!  He re-made my order and personally delivered it to me even though I had already received my sandwiches from the first delivery driver.  Thanks, Austin!  You didn't have to do that but I certainly appreciate it!  Aaron"}
{"text":"This place is Awesome!!! Freaky fast delivery!!! Subs are so delicious. Y'all have to try the new ranch that they got . This is my go to spot for lunch on the ASU campus . Keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this location, I walked into extremely loud music and rude employees.  I had to talk loud to get my order in and could barely hear the cashier. When my subs were ready I asked for a bag.. I dont know why I would even have to ask they knew the order was to go...  but when I asked they pointed out the stack of bags to me and told me to bag it myself. Extremely disappointed with the lack of customer service. Subs aren't even that good. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Delivery was fast, efficient, and the gentleman was very polite.  The order was spot on.  Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Stopped by Jimmy John's today for a quick bite while I was out.  The joint seems very clean and the staff were very pleasant.  I ordered the Italian Sub (without mayo) because lets face it, who would put mayo on an Italian sub? The overall menu is limited, somewhat like Subway's.  The food itself isn't very good, therefore I can only give it a two star rating. I can not recommend this joint."}
{"text":"Great location. Friendly and humorous staff. Very quick delivery. I ordered via phone and it took them less than 10 minutes to arrive. Very impressive. Would recommend this location, especially at late night hours when it's less crowded. Keep up the good work, JJ!"}
{"text":"NOT FREAKY FAST!  I placed my order and it took almost 1 hour to recieve it. I called and they told me sorry that they only had one driver. I placed my order at 2:08 and didnt recived it until 3:10. Not even lunch time.... no offer of a discount or anything. NOT HAPPY! Poor service."}
{"text":"What a sandwich....They say. No it's not the best! Why? #1 the bread is old and hard to chew,#2 the veggies they put in the sandwich a joke! 2 slices tomatoes about 5 shreds of thin lettuce and a pinch of sprouts! # 3 They refused to give peppers on the side \"because they are free\" all this for $8.00 not including chips or drink. However the racist remarks and bad attitude are free... Yes Mexicans do eat sweet peppers too....I prefer them on the side!!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever experienced! Ezekiel made me feel as if I was a complete moron for what time I know I put my order in. So after a 45 minute wait for delivery we get our sandwiches. My wife's sandwich came with cheese and she's incredibly allergic to cheese. I explained that at 9pm at night I did not want to wait until 10pm to receive another sandwich, to which he disgustingly replied it doesn't take an hour to make a sandwich. As a manager in the service industry and someone who frequented jimmy johns for a while (and worked for them) I asked for a refund for the sandwich and was told that wasn't possible. After the disgusting treatment from this store and from the management team I will not come back even though a credit was offered. I'm not one to normally complain about bad service, but when I feel I've been treated like trash this is how I respond. Good luck to any future patrons and have fun dealing with this terribly poor customer service they offer at this \"place of business\"."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever!!! Their service is always great, and their food is always consistently good!! Having the option to deliver is always great!"}
{"text":"Walked in and Heaven (I think she was the manager) was too busy chatting with new hire or interviewee to take our order for about 7 mins. When she did walk away from the conversation, she said \" what can you I get for you?\" No apology for no greeting or for lack of attention when we walked in. We place our order and as we were waiting over heard her bash an hispanic female employee because she supposedly made an error. Saying in our presence, \"You are killing me. This is the 3rd thing you screwed up today.\" I love Jimmy John's bread, chips, cookies... But that experience made me thing twice about eating at that location. I will be sending a message to management on their website."}
{"text":"Have to pay for cheese,  hard to customize,  people not too friendly and try to keep you in your lane.   Meat very thin.   Jersey Mikes much better!"}
{"text":"Lousy service and any time I've been there are employee's sitting in a booth right by the door having conversations that are wayyy inappropriate for customers to hear. This location has given me a bad vibe every time I've been in it - which has been few and far between because of the experience from the previous visit. This time I'm done, though. Not going back. Overall feeling is bad vibes and employees that don't care."}
{"text":"Ok, I hate the location, but it's fast and good.   But for God's sake, cut my sandwich in half please! I ask and do not receive. Sometimes I don't want to stuff a whole sandwich in my mouth, got it guys?  Beachclub = bomb"}
{"text":"Love the location and allllll the parking.   Quick, fast, efficient service. The girls were nice.   I took off a star because I feel their sandwiches aren't as big as I thought they used to be, For $7 I expect more meat but I tried the $8 JJ gigantic one and it was awesome.     Get the big $8 sandwich - it's worth it."}
{"text":"We asked for no Italian dressing and it came loaded with it. There were no customers in the store, how could that possibly be missed."}
{"text":"Wow! What excellent service!!! I loved Jimmy John's before, but this was by FAR my favorite experience!  The atmosphere was great. I am definitely coming back with my family. It was very clean- I have no complaints! I always get the beach club (#12, I'm a creature of habit) and this one probably tasted the best. But that could have been due to how satisfied I was with the service!  Courtney S. made my sandwich so of course I have to give her some MAD props! Soo delicious and you have a super great attitude!! MaKayla R. took my order and she was extra bubbly and kind!! Her positive attitude really made my day and she made me feel special when I was asking about other things on the menu by explaining them to me and telling me her favorites!! (#6 with no onions & no mayo by the way).  I really admire her work ethic too! While we were chatting (not long since they're service is super fast!) she was taking inventory on your delicious chips. She seems like managerial material for sure!!  Great job Courtney & MaKayla!!! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Fresh, fast and well priced. Very happy they moved into the area. It is always clean. Everytime I jave gone there has been one of the staff cleaning. Fun atmosphere. ..usually have good music playing too."}
{"text":"We've been going to Jimmy Johns for years and I love their sandwiches! But the customer service at this location SUCKS! The cashier wasn't friendly at all. He put my order in wrong, then when I went back to tell them it was wrong the first guy just looked at me like I was stupid and told me sorry we can't add cheese and mayo. I told them well that's what I ordered. They had to stop everyone else in line to go pull up my receipt. Then came back and told me \"oh he didn't hear you so I can go back and ring you up for a piece of cheese.\" Are you serious...10 mins and all this trouble for 1 piece of cheese, that YOU messed up?!? I'll drive out of my way to go to a different location next time. Horrible customer service!!! I would give them a one star, but the sandwiches are still tasty."}
{"text":"Once over an hour...no problem stuff happens. Twice over an hour and half...really? Never order online always call first to get a fare ETA. Today to deliver .8 miles away was over an hour. Sorry you are not jersey mikes you make simple great sandwiches that are only meant to be delivered quickly! Come on! I love Jimmy Johns but cant order because of the time frame."}
{"text":"Fast and fresh! I like the #8, ham, roast beef. Usually can't eat the whole thing either, so at $6.25, in my opinion, it's a good deal. Nice shaded patio outside too. If it's not 114 degrees out, it makes for a good spot to eat. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I hate that I can't get any toppings for the slims and it cost $4.99. At subway I can get a 6 inch cold cut with all the vegetables and sauces I want for $4.39 and it's more filling. That is what I don't like about jimmy johns. I hope this changes someday."}
{"text":"They decided last week to have a $1 sandwich day till 2pm.  I drove by at 1:50 and there was a line out the door!  I waited a while and went back 2 hours later and the line was gone.  To my surprise, they had an entire list of $5 sandwiches anyway.   The radio was a bit loud whilst I was eating there, I think I've been to a quiter Megadeth concert but I guess I remember being young once and subscribing to the school of thought that if my ears didnt ring when it was turned off  then it wasnt lound enough."}
{"text":"Apparently speed is more important than accuracy here. I've been working a couple blocks nearby for a couple months now with a crew and have come in several times for lunches.   Each time something goes wrong. I guess Mr Jimmy John believes that speedy preparation is the most important factor in food.  I never knew so many hands - 8- were needed to make one sandwich.  And while this element is somewhat amusing, the amusement fades when the finished product is not correctly made.   The reaction to their own mistakes id border line rude making excuses and blaming the customer for mistakes. Yes, more times then I care to detail.  All that aside, the quality of the ingredients sketchy. So little taste for so much meat.  How do they keep the flavor out??!! If you don't care about mistakes made snd flavorless food you can get full for a decent price.  But as they say on the to shirts. You'll freak at how fast they can make your flavorless mistakes!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at quite a few JJ's restaurants in my day but this team deserves a little high-five action. The quality is consistent and the deliveries really live up the the lighting fast reputation.   I order right from the app and within 10 mintues (most of the time) my food is at the door. That's crazy. I can't make a sandwich in my kitchen in the time it takes them to make it and bring it to me."}
{"text":"HAIR IN FOOD! So I went in and ordered a number 14. Service was good, friendly staff. Took my sandwich home, took 1 bite and got a long, dark woman's hair in it. I call them and tell them, they say they will make me a new one and deliver it to me. I thought that was great. Took them 40 min to bring it! That is just plain ridiculous, when I order delivery it never takes that long! VERY disappointed with this location and will not return anytime soon! The management should be embarrassed by how this went down."}
{"text":"Mother of God: this place is brilliant.  Firstly, it's a Jimmy Johns, so the sandwiches are solid. But this is an abnormally good Jimmy Johns. Several reasons:  1) The Staff. Today they recognized that I didn't have my son with me like I usually do. They're friendly, but not \"corporate drone\" friendly. This is good customer service. Also the staff appears relatively happy, which is important for quality food. Also this visit: the guy who made my sandwich (in like 90 seconds) said \"I made this the 'wrong' way so it doesn't fall apart when you eat it.\" He was right. The sandwich was superb (Italian night club with pep).  2) Mayonnaise. Present in every Jimmy Johns but bears repeating.  3) One time I went in here they were blaring Heavy Metal and I heard that terrible \"F\" word like seven times. I'm a married banker with a kid, and I don't particularly like Metal, but it's nice to have that \"privately owned\" feel.  4) This place is never busy. And you wouldn't wait long anyways, since this place has handed me my sandwich in the amount of time it took to process my debit card, but still, it's awesome.  5) Want to save calories? Not be a giant fat-ass? Well no one does the lettuce wrap like Jimmie Johns. Extra Mayo Unwich for the win.   The bad: A lot of the time they just hand you the sandwich if you just get one, and then you forget to grab napkins, and the mayo and pepper juices mix and drips out the back of the Sammich on your pants, but that's your fault. Take some personal responsibility. Also they have sprouts on the menu. They taste like you're licking a tree trunk covered in moss, but I know people who think they're exquisite. Those people are wrong."}
{"text":"I came here about an hour before they closed which is at 11 p.m. on weekdays.  The workers were very friendly.  The #5 Vito is a tasty sandwich that can fill me up.  Not a really hungry guy though.  Same goes with the #9 Italian Night Club which was also delicious.  I've even had the Vegetarian Sandwich on whole grain wheat.  I really loved this sandwich because I love veggies.  Nice little place.  Cleaner than my other favorite place, Capriotti's which is across the street from this location.  Friendly staff though made the difference."}
{"text":"Everything is great except for the cranky, old delivery woman. Every one else has been pleasant and I've always tipped my drivers, but this woman has rudely asked for a tip not once, but twice. You mean your exceptionally rude service was deserving of one? Forgive me for not getting to that. Thanks, but no thanks, we will be ordering from the Pecos location from now on."}
{"text":"This place is usually good. No issues at all. I usually come at night about 2 to 3 hours before they close. Most of the time it's on the weekends I come here just because I have to drop off my roommate at work...  Well today being Sunday we decided to get some Jimmy johns. We got here at as usual no is here. We get up to the door and it's not opening. It says they're open until 10pm but the door wouldn't budge. Let alone the guy in there didn't even look over when we were tapping on the window to tell him the door wouldn't open. So I figure he didn't want business so we went elsewhere. .."}
{"text":"I'm giving JJ's a 4-star rating because they no longer have sprouts as a franchise. Everything is still great, I guess, but having sprouts made their sandwiches infinitely more interesting. They are always friendly and the sandwiches are fresh and arrive quickly. There is also a Subway in this shopping center, but bleh, JJ's is so much better."}
{"text":"First visit and really enjoyed Beach Club...fresh bun and really fresh ingredients...speedy service and friendly staff....they also home deliver one sandwich. I'll definitely order again."}
{"text":"I like all Jimmy John subs.    This location I like the best, very clean environment, good service, great food & they have a drive thru."}
{"text":"Place is a FREAKIN JJOKE, nice campaign slogan bozos... Ive been here many times as the place is literally 2 blocks away ( less than a minute drive) and is usually pretty good. Always do carryout but I ordered delivery this time and no joke waited 44 minutes for 2 sandwiches! WTF LOL. I was in the middle of trying to cancel my order online when the guy showed up, he was like \"I'm sorry for the wait blah blah blah,\" i didn't say a word just tipped him and that was that. God i wish now i was able to cancel the order... How the FREAK do you wait for 2 sandwiches for 44 minutes and when they show up the ORDER IS WRONG??? Place is a shithole and obviously ran by morons, FREAK YOU Jimmy Tards never again. Im not even sure how one would even try to explain or come up with a reason for such incompetence lol, FREAK this place you've been warned yelpers. Good day"}
{"text":"I've always heard my friend's rave about this place, I was visiting family, it started to get late and I didn't want to look for places to get dinner, so, I called Jimmy's. The sandwich was okay but I honestly think it had way too many onions and for the price I probably could've got something better and more filling at Subway - just my personal opinion though - If I'm ever in Tempe and starving, again, I know exactly who to call. ;)  P.s. your delivery guy is cool as $#!+ give that man a raise!!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in the sandwiches and the service. The bread was hard as a rock, there was so little mustard on one of the sandwiches I could hardly taste it and then at the pickup window the sandwiches were put on the counter where I bagged them myself. Is that what is expected of the customer?  I will not be a customer again."}
{"text":"Probably amongst the worst customer service I've had. The cashier was exceptionally rude"}
{"text":"I'm done with Jimmy Johns.   A year ago their delivery driver stole my phone when I went to get the people who ordered food at the office, now this store doesn't know that I can sub pickle for chips and over charged me.  Not to mention it took about 3 minutes for the untrained kid to ring me up.  Jimmy johns service sucks."}
{"text":"Like their freaky fast subs... BUT  SO.MANY.DRUNK.KIDS.  And by kids I mean fellow ASU students whose parents just let them off their leash to run wild around ASU. This is the local drunk food hotspot on any Vuesday (Tuesday), Thirsty Thursday, Friday, Sat or Sun. Doesn't matter if it's 10am or 12am, you'll spot at least one girl stumbling through their doors."}
{"text":"Honestly the quickest service ever! By the time you've completed your payment, your sandwich is ready. The sandwiches are great, customer service great, and the efficiency is unbeatable. Best place for a QUICK bite!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just don't feel like getting dressed to go out to lunch and that Jimmy John's delivery guy - he's nice - he's not gonna judge!  They have online ordering that will remember your favorites & they are not kidding about their crazy fast delivery. Seriously, it is so fast! I believe you can even order 1 sandwich.  My fave is the beach club - turkey, cheese, avocado spread, cucumbers, lettuce - you can opt for the 7 grain bread or the French bread. I love both options! They have the basics covered too - turkey, ham, roast beef, etc etc. The Italian night club is another favorite of mine.   If you're lucky enough to live near one that will deliver, check them out some lazy day!"}
{"text":"Today I got a gift card. I was shocked as I requested email and phone contact. I'm happy again now that they fixed it."}
{"text":"I ordered what I order at every Jimmy John's location: beach club, no tomato, add the peppers, and cut it in half. It's so much easier to eat when they cut it in half, and the peppers add so much flavor! I got exactly what I ordered, and I got it freaky fast! The store was clean, and the service was fast, what else do you need?"}
{"text":"My favorite JJ's in the area for sure! Always as fast as promised and their bread game is on point. Exactly the experience I anticipate every time!"}
{"text":"OK you ready for this? So 52 minutes later when they are only a quarter of a mile away. I called about 30 minutes after ordering to find out where my subs were and the guy on the phone told me that he should be there any minute. 22 minutes later he shows up, knocks on my door, and when I answer it he looks at me and says \"yo dawg it's Friday it's hectic out there\". Really? Must be really hectic to drive less than a quarter-mile away. This is the second time I use delivery and it took over 35 minutes."}
{"text":"Hair in my sub today. GROSS.  And no power towels in the bathroom. They seem too cheap. Like at least offer napkins when I'm eating there. The mayo was overflowing on my sandwich it tasted gross. I think I'll still to a different location."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch when I'm in the area.  It's been one of my favorite places during the week to grab a Sandwich for the past 2.5 yrs.  I still can't get away from my #9 Italian Club w/Hot Peppers.  They make the Sandwiches very fast here, so during the lunch hour rush the line moves fast.  However, seating can be a challenge during that time.    If you're office or home is in the area, they also deliver.  As long as they stay consistent, I will keep coming back.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Sometimes its good to have a lot of choices. But when you're starving and you just want something...not so good because everything sounded good! I don't understand the menu's being huge and plastered high up on walls. I know, I know, take a few giant steps back maybe you'll see it better. Hell, step outside and look...oh yea, nevermind I forgot my glasses. LoL! I think that was my only issue about the place.  OKay, so I got a 8\" sub with a large fountain drink - 8 bucks. Not bad. I don't remember what it was called, I think it was the #12. It had avocado, provelone and turkey slices. I love that they pile on a lot of shredded lettuce on it. I asked for sprouts, but she heard sauce. And it got slapped with mayo. Whatever, I was hungry and it still tasted good, except with all that sauce the insides kept slidding out the back everytime I took a bite.  The place was nice, seating is limited. They do have some outside tables. The music is a little too loud. The cashier was patient as we hemmed and hawed and helpful when we asked questions. Once we ordered, the sandwhichs were put together very quickly and the name of your sandwhich yelled out for you at the other end. All 4 of us enjoyed our sandwhichs. 1 coworker got a pickle to eat later. When she opened it later that day, it was sliced in 4, and she gave me one. OMG! I know what I'm getting next time."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Jimmy Johns.  Their Sandwiches are awesome and they make them fast.  After a day of golf, we stopped by here to grab a bite to eat.  I ordered my usual #9 Italian Club (Genoa Salami, Capicola, Ham, Provolone, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, Mayo & Vinaigrette) w/Hot Peppers. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jimmy-johns-las-vegas-5?select=k4xX3GEN6rl_P0O6xWzTww#k4xX3GEN6rl_P0O6xWzTww http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jimmy-johns-las-vegas-5?select=tN1SmiFrZvJnfbKeNPsOwQ#tN1SmiFrZvJnfbKeNPsOwQ  As usual, the Sandwich was tasty and awesome.

{"text":"Time to update my review.  This place is one of the regular Sandwich shops in my rotation.  Over the past couple of years, they've made solid Sandwiches and I still order the #9 Italian Club.  Fast, consistent service is the norm here....I give a lot of credit to consistency, especially when it's good.  That's why I keep coming back.  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is one of my favorite Sandwich joints.  I know it's a chain, but they make great Sandwiches and FAST!  This particular location is one where I go often for lunch.

Since then I've discovered the #9 Italian Club (Genoa Salami, Capicola, Smoked Ham, Provolone Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Mayo, Italian Vinagrette, $5.75) and add Hot Peppers $.25.  I can't get over how fast they make Sandwiches here....seriously, it takes them like 1 to 2 minutes max.  The Italian Club Sandwich has become my new favorite......it's full of flavor and filling.  I love the Hot Peppers....wish I could buy them at the store to take home.  The proportion of meat, cheese, and ingredients is perfect.  This is becoming one of my favorite Sandwich joints.

{"text":"As many of my friends know, I love Sandwiches.....especially Jimmy Johns.  I stopped by this location and ordered a #9 Italian Club (Genoa Salami, Italian Capicola, Smoked Ham, Provolone Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Mayo, Italian Vinaigrette, $5.25) and added Hot Peppers, Vinegar Potato Chips ($1.39), and Soda ($.99). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IRpZS7EmmBeSM7oBnDd5iw?select=8nTOvKrKJYePvqOUklYa0Q http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IRpZS7EmmBeSM7oBnDd5iw?select=1BQbD18J_MjO5NVKs53BuQ  Of course the Sandwich was made within 2 minutes of ordering....I don't know how they can make a Sandwich so fast, but they do!

{"text":"so, i now work in their delivery area. i ordered my sandwich on line @ 11:31am. delivered to me, in my hands, at 11:39! unreal!!! great fresh ingredients, fast service with a smile. cant beat it. plus its the same price as subway but fresher, friendlier AND FREE delivery! sold. thank you JJ's."}
{"text":"I've never tried this restaurant chain before, even though they have some locations in my home area. So when I saw that a Jimmy John's had popped up right next to the Westin, where I'm spending the weekend for a convention, I decided this was a good opportunity to try it.  Ordering is reasonably efficient, although the way the menu is structured, it can take a bit to figure out what's already in the sandwich and what other toppings you can request. Also, cheese is included with some sandwiches but extra in other sandwiches, and the cashier doesn't tell you when it's extra. Given that you don't actually get a receipt until the sandwich is ready, which I find to be a very odd practice, that's a swindle in the making and it's too late to protest the upcharge by the time you see it.  The sandwich itself isn't really spectacular. I'd say it's about average among all the deli subs I've ever tried. They weren't really generous with the toppings, so the price was a tad much for what I got. I did like their iced teas and it was nice that they were prompt in making fresh iced tea when the dispensers ran out.   Overall impression: Jimmy John's is probably reliable and consistent since it's a well-established chain, but I'd still prefer somewhere else for sandwiches."}
{"text":"I usually call for delivery to be delivered to my job and I usually am satisfied but this time when my sandwich was horrific must have been a bad batch of Tuna, the response to my complaint was RIDICULOUS! So the Manager on duty today, Friday, 1/30/15 at 2:15pm took my complaint. I told him there is something off about my Tuna sandwich and he said \"It was made fresh today\" so I asked him \"when today?\" and he responds with \"This morning\". So I told him \"Well it's really off and the bread is so hard it hurts to bite into it\". He said \"I can deliver you a new one but it'll be the same batch\". So I responded and told him, \"yeah no I don't want the same batch I can't eat any more of that Tuna\"...and guess what his response to me was \"Well, sorry you didn't like your sandwich\" and hung up on me! What the hell type of service is that! I'm mad as hell! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! When a customer only eats the decent sandwiches and doesn't have to deal with customer service you never know how good a business is until they respond to a complaint! BRIAN was his name! AWFUL"}
{"text":"Been to Jimmy Johns a couple times now and they are definitely better than your average \"sub shop\". The staff is always more than courteous, the menu is easy to read and they have a wide variety to choose from. I personally do not eat meat so I stick to the vegetarian sandwich. With sprouts and avocado included, JJ immediately scores points with me. The bread is freshly made and tastes perfect, cheese is excellent, vegetables are extremely fresh and at $4.50 for a 8\" sandwich makes it a better deal than Subway. Will definitely return :)"}
{"text":"It's not bad, but the options are so limited and there just isn't much there. And now that they have to compete with Which Wich they might be in a lot of trouble. You can't compare the two offerings. Personally, I'm pretty much done with JJ."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed when the sign in the window at this address read \"Dunkin Donuts coming soon!\" was taken down. As an East Coast transplant, DD was a welcome addition, and only 1 mile from my house! I was sure whatever corporate schlock peddler would replace it would be awful. Yesterday, I drove by the location, and saw a sign reading \"Jimmy Johns now open\". WooHoo, another sandwich shop. I got home, and told my wife about what I saw, and we decided to give JJ's a whirl. We ordered online, I got the smoked turkey and bacon (the LuLu), and my wife ordered the vegetarian. The food arrived in exactly 24 minutes, that's fast!! My sandwich was fabulous, they built the sandwich with ample amounts of meat and cheese, and did not over do the condiments. The roll was fresh and amazing. It had a firm outer crust, followed by a pillow soft interior. The veggies were all fresh and crunchy. I added light oregano and lite oil and vinegar, which was perfect for me. My wife loved her sandwich as well, for the same reasons. We will be ordering again soon, I urge everyone else to give JJ's a try!!"}
{"text":"Had gargantuan sandwiches and they were horrible. We have probably eaten at least 20 sandwiches from this Jimmy Johns since they opened. The bread was less than fresh. Not enough mayo so they were dry. Finally there was a long hair in my wife's sandwich. At $23 it was not cheap. Too bad their sandwiches used to be great and dependable. Don't know if we will order in the future."}
{"text":"The staff here are always kind, the food tastes amazing, my order is always right, the delivery is freaky fast... but I get mild food poisoning every other time I eat here. :( Only this location, which is the only location that delivers to ASU. I usually order the turkey tom with provolone cheese in case anyone is wondering. I wish I could give 5 stars."}
{"text":"What's not to like about Jimmy John's? A great variety of tasty sandwiches filled with various meats and cheeses at a reasonable price. Clean surroundings with cool postings on their walls!  Hardly got my meal paid for and before I can walk away from the register, it's ready! Just as they claim, \"Subs so fast you'll freak!\""}
{"text":"Upon moving to Charlotte a friend of mine was showing me around the area while we discussed the foods I was so happy to be able to try again.  I mentioned how much I liked Jimmy John's and a few other similar chains.  She immediately turned to me an and commented that I eat like a college kid.  Yes I do!  Proudly.  I had my first Jimmy John's in Dallas-Ft. Worth.  It made it to San Antonio several year's back and immediately became my goto place for a great sub.  I'm not sure how many times I came up with an excuse to visit that location, but when I moved to Hawaii, I was was forced into a self-inflicted abstention for 2-years.  I did get to eat one sub in DC while on a trip, but it wasn't until I moved to the Steele Creek area and discovering the Ft. Mill location did my love affair with the #5 Vito begin anew.    This location is across from Baxter Village off 160.  It's not the easiest store to get to, but if you are a lover of fresh bread, no obstacle will get in your way.  My first visit here was in November 2016.  It was probably at 730.  There were several crew members on staff, but very few of them seemed to be interested in my overly-excited presence.  I ordered the #5 without much fanfare and asked about their day old bread which they sell (I love their day-old bread.  I pick it up to make my own sandwiches, garlic bread, &c.  It is just a great addition to any meal and a huge reason I am always thinking about stopping by).  They were out for the day.  After a few moments my sandwich was complete and we were off.  The staff didn't leave much of an impression on me.  When I got home and carefully unwrapped the original Italian sub with genoa salami, provolone, capicola, onion, lettuce, tomato & a real tasty Italian vinaigrette: Hot peppers included.  It was everything I expected and the taste was simply divine.    It took a few weeks, but I headed back once again in January.  Like the first time there were several team members mulling around.  It just didn't feel like I was in the presence of cohesive well-oil staff.  They seemed to be going through the routine, but the excited I've received from other locations has much greater.  Like before we got our #5, a Soda, and some chips as well as 3 loaves of day-old bread and departed.  The meal was just as great as before.  The team is efficient and I have zero complaints about the quality of the product.    Our most recent visit was this past Friday.  We got our usual and picked up some loaves once again.  This time we were there later and they were preparing to dump the day-old bread for the night.  For the first time in three visits, the team was smiling a bit more and even offered me some of the bread since it was about to be tossed.  That was a nice touch.    What can I say.  This Jimmy John's is there.  I visit and the service can be decent.  Nothing beyond that is special aside from the those amazing subs and best day-old bread ever.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great for a fast lunch break during the work week. They are nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Literally the biggest sh!t show I've ever had to deal with. Forgot to bring half my order 4 times!!!!! Place is a joke that needs some new managment... better yet any managment. Stay away!"}
{"text":"8\" subs are to DIE for. I order for delivery all the time and they come SO unbelievably fast and it is absolutely delicious. I've never had any problems & the drivers are always super nice!"}
{"text":"I have had nothing but satisfactory experiences with this Jimmy Johns. I order delivery quite often AND stop in to pick up myself and their crew is always on top of my order. Whether you like the assembly line structure of their business or not these guys stay busy and work their butts off to provide me with a simple and tastey lunch. They have never goofed up any of my orders, nor have I received unpleasant customer service from the staff."}
{"text":"I generally enjoy Jimmy John's and this place is literally 1 mi from my house, which are the only reasons I continue to give this location business. The employees are mentally very slow and they have screwed up my sandwich on several occasions. I don't order anything difficult either, usually just no tomato and sometimes I request mayo on a slim. NOT VERY COMPLICATED STUFF.   It's Jimmy John's. It's relatively fast and cheap. Liek the saying goes \"Fast, Cheap, Good. Pick two, cause you'll rarely find all three. I dread going in to order just because I can feel the level of \"idiot\" in that place and it's stressfull."}
{"text":"The supervisor/manager Gabby is the most unprofessional worker I have ever dealt with. Not only do we order large orders 24-48 hours ahead, we do this frequently for all our college meetings/events. No matter how early I order, the order is either wrong or late EVERY SINGLE TIME. its gotten to the point where I specially ask for Gabby to take my order to try and avoid these mistakes. I assumed if I asked to order from who's in charge then the chances of my order being correct were higher. Right? WRONG. Twice I ordered a large amount of sandwiches and asked for them to be individually bagged (which I know is a hassle for jimmy johns but Gabby assured me they would make an exception and there would be no issues since I ordered so far in advance) we explained when we need them and why it's important for them to be on time (having over 20+ people waiting for their lunches is an important reason to be punctual - not sure if Gabby is aware)  Both times the lunches were over 40 minutes late WITHOUT a call informing us prior even though gabby insisted that our order would be on time.  -I understand things are going to be late. People are human and things happen. But every single time this happens and every single time Gabby responds to the situation as if I ordered my food last minute, gave wrong directions or my favorite when the delivery time is 11 and I call at 11:05 and THEY ARE STILL MAKING THE SANDWICHES. When a business takes the time to order a day or two ahead and you promise the order will be successful you should be doing anything in your power to fulfill that promise instead giving up or just tell the truth and say that it's not possible and is going to take longer so I can make other arrangements.  Gabby \"attempted\" to make the situation better by offering us $30 credit on our next order (two different times so a total of $60 credit) but gabby lied to us and never added any credit to our account.  She failed to make any notation of credit on our account even though she verbally said she would over the phone - when confronted she denied ever saying she'd give us credit for the order being wrong/late.   Gabby is not a good example of someone you want running your store, dealing with customers, let alone being a supervisor.   We will continue to tell all UNLV colleges to refrain from ordering from this store."}
{"text":"If you haven't experienced Jimmy Johns  yet.... grab your car keys, your walking shoes, your bike, your bus pass, whatever you need to get there and experience the pure awesomeness that is JJ's.  Yeah, Yeah its just another sub shop right?  NO, the bread is amazing and baked fresh every day.   They even offer \"Free Smells\" which is a way better smell than the Subway Stench you have stuck in your clothes for days after you walk in the door.   JJ's uses fresh ingredients, amazing baked fresh daily bread and makes it \"So fast you'll freak\" right there.  My sandwich is usually done by the time I'm don't paying for my order.  The sub names are fun too, who wouldn't want to order a Pepe, a Turkey Tom or the Gargantuan!  They have vegetarian options, low carb options (unwhich- but why you would get rid of the best part of the sandwich is beyond me) and will customize your order if you don't like the menu options.   JJ's also offers their \"day old loafs\" for pretty cheap (under $1) and is great for making garlic bread  or something at home.  Coming from the Midwest, JJ's was a staple and I was really disappointed when I first moved here to find that the valley was JJ free... luckily all good things from Michigan are slowly creeping over here, Jimmy Johns, Bell's beer and next we might just see Coney Island's popping up."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are ok depends on who is making them sometimes really good. They are very inconsistent which is aggravating. They are pretty quick!!!!"}
{"text":"I guess one mile is too far for them to deliver. Just ridiculous. If you live on the north side of route 2 don't bother calling here to order."}
{"text":"I work in the downtown area and order Jimmy John's a few times a week. Their sandwiches are delicious and so fresh. The delivery is very fast, and the people that work here are very nice. Always a great experience with this location."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I placed an order for delivery today around 12:40. I did not receive my order until a full hour later around 1:40. Also, the delivery driver must have been chain-smoking in his car because he stank of cigarettes and SO DID MY FOOD!! FUCKING DISGUSTING!!!!! I will never order delivery from this store again."}
{"text":"I just couldn't eat here. A friend and I decided to try it since it was in the area. We came in and were greeted with loud shouts from the staff. It was cute at first, but we realized as we were taking a good read of the menu that this exuberance was displayed as anyone left or entered. When it became quickly apparent that we would not be able to have a conversation, it became just too much for us, so we decided to go elsewhere.   I would give just 1 star, but I have heard that the food is good from others, and since I didn't end up eating there, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. If you want to hear yourself and your company when eating, I suggest getting takeout."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches, and a very efficient place for a quick lunch.  I particularly love the #17...."}
{"text":"I got a tuna sandwich, very delicious, I'd say it's superior to Subway...yes, I said it! The girls serving have a very nice attitude (there were no guys, in case the gender police is reading this) haha! I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Say hello to Vito #5- exnay the onions. I'm sure you're super interested in this... however I found it super interesting that they serve these \"Atkins style- or another word used by millenniums I totally forget. So a bowl of lettuce and all the toppings of your sandwich, folks. Looks good, but I insist I shall miss the bread.  More treadmill please."}
{"text":"Excellent! Customer service is canned and attention on other staff members but who cares in the end!"}
{"text":"Fast service. Friendly people. It's an ok deal. Very close to my work so it's a matter of convenience. I always get the Vito. And tea."}
{"text":"What is with the Lord of the Rings theme music blaring on the speakers? Doesn't make for a welcoming environment! So strange....and this location doesn't carry sprouts.  Booooo!"}
{"text":"Ugh. Got the Italian Night Club to go. Asked for the mayo and dressing on the side. Was told they are not able to do that. They have no Dixie cups. Really? They finally found something to put it in. Shouldn't have bothered anyway. Was just oil n vinegar. Made my own dressing at home. Bun was a glorified hot dog bun. Smh."}
{"text":"Definitely a goood samich here.....I'd have to say the best COLD samich I had so far in vegas.  Bread is fresh, veggies crisp, meats are tasty, they have cherry peppers a++ for me...luv those things.  Nice atmosphere with interesting reading on the walls.  You gotta try this place, I think you will agree that it stomps all over subway.....til next time, good eating!"}
{"text":"We ordered online. Quick n easy. It says they dont deliver n Im like 2 miles away litrrally. So where do they deliver cause im right in between two locations? Anyhow, that would be my ONLY complaint. Food is awesome. Just enough of everything..nothing overdone. We got two gargantuans for hub n i and the kids each got a slim. Paid around $30 for 4 subs which is more than other places. We usually do gatti's down the road...we just were wanting to try something different. Ill still probably stick to gattis for my usual place cause they have more variety..but this is nice- different- for every now n then... another instance where delivering would encourage more orders..."}
{"text":"Rude. Seems like they close whenever they feel like it, rather than the posted hours of 10AM-10PM. Nothing like the original Jimmy Johns at EIU."}
{"text":"apparently my last review was removed. good sandwiches however they only deliver about half a mile when there is a huge subdivsion about a mile from them if they would deliver more than 1/2 mile woulda given them a better review"}
{"text":"When this place first opened years ago, I honestly wasn't a fan. Then everyone kept raving about the bread and what not. None the less, I gave good old Jimmy another chance. Kalila M. had recommended the beach club and ever since then I had fallen in love. The turkey, avocado, and sprouts really does the trick along with the mayo. The wheat bread is pretty good too, but I feel like it's a tad less of the overall sandwich compared to when you get white bread. I heard the \"protein style\" or whatever they call it is like a bite of freshness.  Definitely need to try that out one of these days. This particular location is pretty neat too since it has an upper floor. And as all Jimmy Johns' the service is speedy. They try to achieve serving your sandwich by the time you finish paying and it normally happens, I think? Oh and by the way they have stamp cards now! One last tip, I don't recommend buying the day old bread because all they do is wrap paper around the middle part leaving the sides open and it doesn't store well not unless you immediately use it.  Mine became dry and stale."}
{"text":"Always fast delivery. we make big orders at work and they never disappoint. So if your an individual party the service would be exceptional. The delivery guy today was so kind to return with our missing order item and was so kind when he arrived. Food tastes excellent as always. Can make debit/credit orders on phone as well"}
{"text":"Horrible experience employee was very rude they refused to give me Italian dressing on the side so I asked him are you willing to lose a customer over this and they were more than happy to oblige They act like they don't work at a sandwich shop or something like that are so great it's ridiculous I will rather go to Subway and get treated decently then go to another Jimmy John's I will never ever go to another jimmy John's as long as I live especially the one on the rural and baseline"}
{"text":"They always mess up your order.  I have ordered hear several times.  They simply don't pay attention. This time they forgot my kickin ranch. They forget this half the time it seems.  Store manager needs to be retrained or removed."}
{"text":"Amazing food, delivery girl was super polite and nice. Quick, everything I ordered. Will be a regular now. Nice to have in steelyard, just moved here"}
{"text":"Always fresh, fast, & friendly. 2nd visit this week and it's only Tuesday! Turkey Tom with cucumbers, nice and light! Staff is always eager to help and very friendly. Food is always fresh. Keep up the good work, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Out of all the sandwich shops in the world, my heart belongs to Jimmy John's. Their sandwiches are out of this world delicious, and they live up to their name \"gourmet sandwiches.\"  Food: I always get the #9 Italian Night Club with light mayo, add sprouts & cucumbers. I swear by this and have converted all my friends to love this item from Jimmy John's. It has real genoa salami, Italian capicola, smoked ham, and provolone cheese topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onion, mayo, and their homemade Italian vinaigrette. Their bread is what makes this sandwich come to life, and what makes them different from any other sandwich shop. It may not be whole wheat or have cheese on top or anything fancy, but once you try their bread, you will understand. The bread is stiff enough to hold the ingredients without it becoming soggy or fall apart, yet soft enough to not overwork your jaw when eating.   Each sandwich on their menu is perfectly paired with the right ingredients and they are so generous with their meats to cheese to bread ratio. Trust me, I can eat like a pig, yet still have left overs for later. In addition, if you ever have a problem with the pairing, just ask them to switch ingredients, add extra of whatever you want, or make it super plain Jane.   Service: this location is amazing. All their staff members are friendly, it's always clean, and they really are freaky fast with getting my order. I never had a problem with my sandwich and it is consistency fresh & tasty.   Jimmy John's is great for breakfast, lunch, mid-day snack, dinner, basically anytime of the day. Add their amazing chips, cooked in peanut oil, or cookies to make it the best gourmet meal ever!"}
{"text":"Super rude service .   Walked in a quarter to ten . Was just asking what time they closed ( irregardless we were not going to be the dicks who ordered at ten ). All jimmy johns are different , some are open 24 hours some are opened till midnight . The guy gave us attitude and the employees behind the counter laughed at us for walking in . They all just stopped and stood there no welcome or anything . Most jimmy johns would have asked what we would like to order , they pretty much told us not to order .   Once again , you work in the service industry . You don't wanna serve people till your scheduled hours of operation get a different job ."}
{"text":"Super fast service of OK-tasting subs. I've definitely had better, so the signs hanging all over the place that claim that they're \"gourmet\" is definitely a bit of marketing puffery. Yes, it's gourmet compared to....actually, I think Subway makes a better sub, so I can't really compare it to being more gourmet than anything really. Maybe it's gourmet because they put a ton of sprouts (and lettuce) in the sub?   I will give the place props for the very speedy service. I ordered my sub and it was handed to me within 1 minute. Another thing I noticed about the place was that it was filled with male patrons. If you're a single lady looking for a manly man, come to Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"The neon sign on the stores window shouts 'FREE SMELLS' so I decided to pop in with my daughter for a whiff or two. Not bad. Not bad at all... so we decided to stay for lunch.  We ordered two subs, a bag of chips, and some drinks and they were prepared very fast.  Freaky fast actually...  As they should have been as there were seven (I counted) employees working on this Wednesday afternoon.  They were all doing something and nobody was standing still.  A couple were cleaning, two were making the food and bread, one was ringing the cash register, another was carrying a stack of papers (clearly the manager), and one just returned from a delivery. The place was very clean, the subs were made accurately and the quality of the ingredients made them taste pretty darn good.  Jimmy Johns is a slightly more expensive option compared to some of the other sub places but you get what you pay for and it is in-line with the value for your money. They charge a dollar extra for cheese despite the fact that cheese is in the very definition of 'sub'.  That must be how they make up for all those 'Free Smells' they're giving away all willy-nilly!"}
{"text":"I've had JJs delivered to many of our school events and boy they got one of the best sandwiches. Our school organization orders from many different places around the neighborhood from Subway, Rubios, Papa Johns, etc. And I gotta say, they are pretty on point with their delivery and service.   As for the food, it's definitely a step up from subway. Their bread is not airy or tasteless like Subway and they have the right amount of meat, lettuce, and tomato. I'm not sure if they have more toppings, but I like how they keep it simple because it tastes good! One thing that I did notice about their sandwiches is that they sometimes put a lot of mayo on it and don't give it to you separately. So if you are not a fan of mayo, make sure to ask for it off?"}
{"text":"I WAS excited to see that a jimmy johns had recently opened up near my house. I called and gave them my complete order and personal information including credit card number, in all it was about a 10 to 15 minute call and just when we were getting off the phone she asked me where my major crossroads were. At which point she told me we were out of the delivery area. So basically it was a complete waste of time and when i called back to make sure that my card was not charged i spoke to the manager who was EXTREMELY rude and told me that they did charge and it would be voided. You would think at that point they would send their driver an extra block."}
{"text":"I like to order and pay online. It's ready when I get there 5 minutes later. The food always tastes fresh and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Not a nice place. Food is crummy and the staff is slow. I had a negative experience at this store and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Pretty shady this location charges you for WATER!  I asked for a cup so I can have some water while I waited for my sandwich  and the cashier said is going to be  $.27  cents more .....WTF!!!!! We are in arizona people.   First business on mill avenue I hear such a non sense Xtra charge for water."}
{"text":"Since they fix the problem I love eating at this place I would recommend eating the hunger club so good"}
{"text":"Try the Gargantuan, it is delicious. Their delivery is top notch as well. I work close to the Rainbow location and they have the food here literally within 20-30 minutes. Outstanding. Good quality, must have. No more subway!!!"}
{"text":"cannot go wrong with the gargantuan, super delicious. ordered for 7 guys at my office, they only took about 30-40 minutes for delivery which was great. highly recommend over subway as pricing is just as reasonable, maybe a little more."}
{"text":"You know, I'm super glad that Jimmy John's are franchises. It's the only way my conscience can handle coming here. That's all I will say about that.  This JJ's crew is top notch. As usual, the restaurant is clean, organized, and well staffed.  The food is fresh and amazing as always. It is really hard to not pig out when I am here."}
{"text":"I dropped by in the afternoon to grab a few sandwiches for my family, and was excited to see that there was no line!  The place was also staffed to the gills, 3-4 employees on the sandwich line. But it still took them nearly 10 minutes to make all 3 of our sandwiches! I believe the problem truly was \"too many cooks in the kitchen\"!  The taste was good, but took too long!  Note: I visited in August 2016"}
{"text":"Really good sandwich - I had the #12 on a really good roll. The bread was perfectly crunchy but soft inside. The avocado spread was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Tried Jimmy John's a few weeks ago and they have great sandwich's and the breads really fresh. Also have nice and quick service"}
{"text":"Very pleased with experience this evening. My sammich came just as good as if I made it myself. I'm glad I didn't pass up my order based off some other people's crappy reviews. Personally they gave me exactly what I ordered, and the guy who delivered it was friendly and social. I love that. Good job Jimmy Johns!"}
{"text":"Apparently they don't delivery 3 miles away from them. That must be why they're known for being \"so fast\", you gotta be in walking distance for them to deliver to you at all. I had to repeat everything four times minimum and I'm still not sure she got our address right."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is exaclty as they advertise. They make some good subs and always deliver quick. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because I wish their subs were bigger."}
{"text":"Why does this location charge $9 for a Giant Club when every other location in this state charges $6.69 for the same exact sandwich? Price gouging much?"}
{"text":"So... I will preface my review by saying that I like Jimmy John's sandwiches. I think they are a great value... product vs. price. They are generally fresh, tasty, and about $5.50 for a decent sandwich.   That being said... For this particular location.... Last night (Sunday evening) I went online and placed an order for two sandwiches... the online process is very smooth and intuitive. I paid online as well, and as it turns out, I fortunately printed and took my receipt.   I drove to the store and walked in.  That's where it ALL WENT DOWN HILL!!! They had the music SO FRIGGING LOUD it hurt my ears to listen to it. And it was that crappy heavy head banging acid rock that always sounds like people are screaming incoherently with the mike shoved half way down their throat.  Then... as I struggled to converse with the \"kid\" (literally) at the register... he could not find any reference of my online order. Nor could several other \"kids\" who worked their this Sunday evening.  This was supposed to have been \"ready for me to pickup\". Finally a manager came over and apologized and found the order in the system.   Thankfully Jimmy John's prides itself on making the sandwiches fast... but I couldn't even hear them calling my name when they were ready.   Hopefully someone from corporate will read this review and act upon it. Defiantly not a satisfying experience."}
{"text":"I am SO disappointed! You now have to have a minimum order of $25 BEFORE tax to order online for pickup. That's garbage. Jimmy Johns is a serious ripoff. That's at least 4 sandwiches and 2 drinks if you're lucky to hit the goal. For a college town- there's no way! Now were just getting greedy! I'll make some dude deliver my sub for less!"}
{"text":"I haven't actually tried the sandwich yet - but my cashier couldn't figure out how much change to give( which was .37c) by the way. We were taking our sandwiches to go and couldn't get the dressing on the side? \"Corporate rules\" ok, but I don't want a soggy sandwich....  \"Can I get the peppers on the side?\" \"No. You cannot have ANYTHING on the side\" so a sandwich which is 8\" long I now cannot share, and instead by an additional $7 sandwich. Kind of a rip off."}
{"text":"Absolute worst Jimmy John's. I work right across the street and somehow, the sandwich is marked \"out for delivery\" for over 40 minutes each time and I always get the same \"we're understaffed and busy\" stroke job. It gets busy; I get that. But don't mark my food \"out for delivery\" on the order tracker when it's obviously either not out for delivery, or sitting in the back of a hot car going stale, just so your driver can save time. This is absolutely awful and it has gotten worse and worse over time. I'm sick of the incompetence and won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Love jimmy johns but SO ANNOYED that they don't deliver to where I live. Been waiting a year for them to expand delivery zones. I live 2.5 miles away.... don't see why they can't deliver. That's what they brag about the quick delivery of delicious food well kind of missing out on the delivery part."}

{"text":"Came out to PA to visit some family and passed by this joint.  I've seen the name jimmy John around through advertisements but had never seen or eaten at one in CA.  I had to stop to grab a quick bite and try out the hype.  I'm still salivating for the day it comes to CA.  So much nicer than our Subways and quiznos.  My wife used to talk about these awesome Jimmy John sandwiches when she was in school in Indiana and how she missed them so much now that shes back in CA.  This restaurant is clean and it looks like the brand has their process in order.  Gimme more!"}
{"text":"I literally ate here so much that my boyfriend made me stop going. That is how much I love their veggie sandwiches and I have been SO over Subway since 1994. Subway just never had much to offer me in the way of a cheese sandwich because:  gross!  I basically expected their veggie to be a huge gigantic letdown in that way you do when you are a vegetarian and have to order the \"obligatory veg\" meal at a place that your meat eater friends eat.   Not only was my mouth surprised by the OMG yummy, but Jimmy John's sandwiches are filling in a way that Subway is not for a vegetarian. Maybe its because they put more than one slice of cheese on it, maybe its because they spread awesome avocado sauce all over it and don't charge extra. Who knows, who cares. All you need to know is NOM NOM Down the hatch!!!  As for this particular location, they started to know me and know my order. Call me old fashioned, but I like that! The service is almost always great and my food is consistently yummy. What more could I really ask for besides a Jimmy John's closer to where I live?"}
{"text":"The turkey tom is amazing honestly one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. And it was so fast I freaked"}
{"text":"The guy taking orders needs to learn to speak to the people handing him our hard earned money.  It's easy.  The sandwich was made quickly and served quickly but without napkins.  Lets see - Bread and tomatos were the only things I could taste on this sandwich.  Oil and vinegar supposedly made a stop somewhere near the sandwich but not as far as I could taste.  What was that, like two ounces of meat on the bread?  Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service. Location has a drive thru and good parking. Food was average. Visited around 8:00 PM. Dining room had an overpowering smell of dirty mop water and music was blaring overhead. Due to this atmosphere, I will not return on next visit to this area."}
{"text":"At my house, we've ordered from possibly every delivery shop that will bring food to our door.  And in the sandwich department, nothing tops Jimmy John's in my book.  The sandwiches are big, cheap, and delicious.  The delivery has to be the fastest of ANY delivery service.  We call them and have had the food in as little as 15-20 minutes.  Everyone that works there, from the person who takes our order to the delivery driver, are much friendlier than they ever need to be.  I hate places that don't have online ordering, but I don't mind when I have to call this Jimmy John's to order.  Thanks, Crystal!"}
{"text":"I run a summer camp down the street and jimmy johns delivers 3 platters every Tuesday and Thursday. Their sandwiches are amazing and they are always on time. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and freaky fast delivery.  Never waited more than 15 minutes for delivery from any of their locations.  And the delivery people are all very pleasant."}
{"text":"I use to obsessively order from Jimmy Johns.  I love the #2 with cheese and a bag of bbq chips... it is relatively inexpensive for a full belly... i like their new location because they have a lot of extra seating and it's just newer... HOWEVER.  I use to have them deliver...literally...6 times a week to my apartment.  I bought a house 1/8 of a mile from my old apartment and they won't deliver to my house.  They will not cross Torrey Pines to drive to the 4th house in on my street to deliver me the same food they use to deliver 6 times a week when I lived 1/8 of a mile away... blows me mind... i now have eaten at this location... twice since they've moved... it has literally left a bad taste in my mouth that they can't make an exception since I use to order from them so often for 4 houses down...so essentially... they have lost my business because i loved that i could have food delivered when i was on my way home from work instead of always having to go pick something up."}
{"text":"Yes, it is only a sandwich shop, but a very good one.  Any sandwich we have had we have throughly enjoyed. If you go in the store they are bright, quick, and very responsive. If your fortunate to be in their delivery area the service is fast. You definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I ordered a meal from your lovely establishment a couple days ago. I waited for an hour and finally walked up to the front to see my food sitting on the reception desk. I have no idea how long it had been sitting there, but that was pretty frustrating. You have my phone # someone could have called me if no one was at reception to take it from you."}
{"text":"I have never had JJ's until this one opened up. I have had quite a few times now and it's delicious. My goto sandwich shop now."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas visiting from California and got excited that there was a jimmy johns... First tried it in Minnesota and fell in love.   This place in Vegas is in a newer shopping center but in a sketchy area by UNLV.   We had a great experience... Ordered _#4 turkey sub with peppers that was perfect! The bread is so fresh, and their chips are delicious...try the jalapeño ones !  Wish they would open up stores in California!!!"}
{"text":"I am on a fixed income and the delivery cost of most places has gotten ridiculous, especially if I leave a tip. It's unaffordable for me anymore and will be a rare occasion if I ever order from them again. Everyone is making it unaffordable for the poorer folk. Jimmy Johns only charges $2 so it is a bit more doable for me. I have had great sandwiches and fast delivery from them everytime. I do miss the variety of other deliveries but it's their loss."}
{"text":"I work literally a block away from this location. Almost every time me or my coworkers order, the order is either incorrect or takes over an hour to arrive. We have complained and our orders are corrected, but not even a free cookie or a discount is ever offered. Neva again, Jimmy Johns. Especially when Panera is now delivering to my work."}
{"text":"LOVE the and sandwiches here. They're also fresh tasting. Never greasy. Only thing that irritates me, I used to work on Ash and Rio Salado and they would deliver, I now work a half mile further (1.7 miles from the closet location) and for whatever reason they don't deliver here... Seriously? You guys would make dough if you delivered to this office plaza!? Guess I'll have to eat crappy cafeteria food again..."}
{"text":"I've never been to a jimmy johns. The people in the store had to have lied to me and told me they do not have just vinager, I have to get oil, and also the yellow mustard is only in packets. I should've saved my money and gone to the grocery store and made it myself. They said this \"ain't\" like subway. I know! I thought it was a step up. Wrong."}
{"text":"Wish I could say something about the food, but I never got it. I tried to order for a meeting at work. Probably a $700 order. But, OMG, we were about 1/4 mile outside their delivery area. Hello!!! I asked to speak with the manager, and the guy said he was the manager, and I was out of luck. Is the recession over for these guys?   Firehouse makes good subs. And they brought them to me."}
{"text":"There was absolutely nothing freaky fast about getting my meal. The staff was incompetent and messed up multiple orders before receiving mine. Complete lack of competence coming from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Every time they've been great. I order on the app and pick it up. Ready fast. I love the freshness of their ingredients. I wanted to take time to rate to show my appreciation."}
{"text":"If I ran a restaurant, this is exactly how I'd run it.  Ignore the food for a second. This business operates like a freakin' machine. All the employees are always working furiously to serve you, the customer. You're 3rd in line from the cashier? The folks at the sandwich line are already asking you what you want. Swiping your credit card for your sandwich? Yeah, it's probably already been made and waiting for you. I really like that the manager here is nice to everyone, but doesn't tolerate anyone screwing around and not working.  The food? Always fresh and delicious. Not much else to say there."}
{"text":"Two stars for the very high quality ingredients used on sandwiches. Went in with my daughter, she wanted a ham and cheese sandwich with pickles on it. Apparently at jimmy johns pickles are not allowed to touch the bread as I was told they won't put pickles on a sandwich and I just had to buy a side pickle. Seems like a very small step to take for customer service. My daughter spilled her drink on the table and I asked the girl at the counter for a towel. This also seemed to be a monumental task. Overall poor customer service, but still one of the best darn sandwiches I have ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Always super quick delivery and order is always accurate. I order online all the time and the sandwich was to my door within 5 minutes, which is quicker than it'd take me to drive over there and order. Also, I put in the notes not to ring the doorbell because babies were sleeping and they did just that! So,Thank you!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and I ordered off of their website.  That was easy enough to do.  The sandwiches were yummy, but small.  8\" is their largest.  My husband easily can eat 12\" with no problems, so I was disappointed that they do not offer a larger size.  French bread was soft and flavorful.  Meats were fresh and so were the toppings.  Catering............I was going to order for a function, but they do not put the sides/toppings on the side or in containers.  We have about 12 people coming and I don't want every sandwich the same. Some may not like lettuce etc. on their sandwich.  I talked with one of the employees about this, and the only thing they put on the side is the mayo and ketchup in packets.  He told me that all sandwiches are made with toppings and that they do not have containers.  I was very disappointed in that.  So with that said I can't give a higher rating because of the size of the sandwiches and the catering issues.  Guess I'll be ordering from Subway again."}
{"text":"Normally I would never do this. Yet, here we are. If you're familiar with the beach club then I'm sure you're just like me and get it for the avocado spread. Because, well, avocado is life. Am I right? So anyways. I order one of those as well as another sandwich. When I got all the way home, my other sandwich was perfect, but of course, my beach club was nowhere near what it was supposed to be. Had every sort of meat available and NO avocado spread. COULD YOU IMAGINE MY SADNESS?! So I call to see if I were to come up there, would they mind giving my correct sandwich and a refund for my troubles of driving all the way back home (since I'm out of their delivery range). The dude was super nice and told me yes, to just bring my receipt and the wrong sandwich. Perfect. I can do that. So I go up there and they make my new sandwich. Then as I'm still standing in line waiting for the customer in front to finish ordering so the cashier can work out my refund, the same dude goes \"are you waiting for a second sandwich?\" So of course I go on to explain our conversation on the phone and how he said I could get a refund and he told me \"oh that's my fault. I was trying to tell you that we could give you the refund or the sandwich.\" Ummmmm..... what???? So I try to explain that due to the miscommunication and the fact that I drove all the way back up there, I felt that a refund should be issued. He goes, \"I know I'm new here and I make a lot of mistakes but I don't think that's something we can do.\" HAHAHAHA. Ok dude. Now, I'm cool with it at his point. I just say \"well thank you for the correct sandwich then\" and walked out. Buuuuuut here's where I get pissed. Because I make it all the way back home with my \"correct\" sandwich and this is what I fucking get......... THE TINIEST BIT OF AVOCADO SPREAD I'VE EVER SEEN! (Refer to picture) You don't wanna give me a refund, fine, but you could at least give me a decent size of what I drove all the way back up there for!! Fucking pricks. Okay. Rant over."}
{"text":"Why did I wait so long to visit Jimmy John's?!  My memories of this chain are filled with lackluster sandwiches. Guess I was ordering the wrong thing.    I checked out the menu online so I could contemplate my choices without holding up the line.  My decision:  a turkey unwich.   Oh, I was skeptical. I mean, how big can a lettuce wrap be?  Turns out Jimmy John's found the jackpot of humongous lettuce leaves.  The only disappointment was the minimal amount of turkey. Everything else was incredibly fresh and tasty.  The dijon had a nice kick to it and the peppers were DELICIOUS.   The cherry on top was walking out and--gasp!--being THANKED for my business.  Thank you Jimmy John's, for adding a little brightness to my day."}
{"text":"Is this for real? I'm sitting here blown away by JJ magic. I ordered a sub online for delivery (first timer). I just casually put in my info and said \"as soon as possible\" thinking I'd be hungry within the next 20 minutes or so. I swear I set my phone down, walked into my kitchen and there was a knock on my door. SEVEN MINUTES! I'm like how did they even get my order that fast?! I'm amazed. This is so great I'm enjoying my perfectly made sub"}
{"text":"I used to go here and order from them alot.  I have over the past few days been calling there to place a phone order and no one answers the phone.  I dont know if they have a problem or not.  I then tried the on line ordering and that was down for that location as well.  Not sure if it is just them or what is going on.  The subs are great, but it would be nice to know if they have a problem or not."}
{"text":"I've been here 3-4 times since they opened and it's been fast. The kids that work here are polite. Sandwiches are good."}
{"text":"Not great but they are really quick! Great when you are starving or in a hurry but don't want drive-thu!"}
{"text":"Being Vegan, Jimmy's isn't high on my list of places to eat but once in awhile I order delivery when I'm at work.  I get the Vegetarian Sub with no cheese and no mayo, add a Jumbo Pickle, quartered, and a bag of plain potato chips.   The sandwich could be better if they used real sliced Avocado instead of the slimy spread but nonetheless its an OK sandwich.  Now, the highlight of the meal is definitely the Pickle, it is by far the Best Pickle I've ever eaten! Just get one you'll see. The chips are your standard bagged crispy kettle chips, I just get the plain since unfortunately their salt and vinegar flavor has milk/whey in its ingredients.  Maybe they could reformulate them and remove the unnecessary dairy ingredient. Hey, a Girl can dream can't she?"}
{"text":"I just wanted to put a review in because I hit this place at least once a week after work. All of the Jimmy Johns Locations are really great but this is the best its closer to my work and I have to locations close to my house but I prefer this one. Everyone in there is always great and my family loves Fridays when I bring everyone sandwiches that they love although grandma wishes they had pastrami. I usually get the Gargantuan Unwich that they always make perfectly. I eat a lot of low carb stuff which get wrapped in to lettuce which most of the time I peel much of it away, but not with the Unwiches because the lettuce actually tastes great and stays together. There is no better Lettuce wrap anything than at Jimmy Johns. Each store I have been to (3 Locations) are always immaculately clean (unlike alot of Subways I have visited but visit no more) Jared with have Subway sooner than I will again."}
{"text":"As a relatively recent transplant from the Midwest, when I heard that a new Jimmy Johns had opened near our neighborhood I was positively thrilled.    We've dined at this location twice now and both times were pretty disappointing, but for different reasons.  The first time we went into the shop for take out.  Clearly the shop and staff were new, so we gave them a wide birth of forgiveness.  The young guy at the register tried to correct what we were ordering on all of our sandwiches, stating that he was, \"just trying to save\" us money.  That's great!  That's really lovely customer service there, but the sandwiches with his well meaning order changes were not at all what we wanted.  That said, we decided to give them another go...and that was today.  I called in a delivery order and yes, they lived up to their slogan, \"Subs so fast, you'll freak!\"  However, when we received our order, it was totally wrong.  Not like we received someone else's order wrong, no, as in the extras that we ordered and paid for were missing from all of the sandwiches.  I immediately called the store, mistakes happen, and when I told the staff what was wrong with our order, I could hear total chaos erupt in the background.  I clarified three times what was missing from our orders and finally I was assured that a new order would be on it's way.  Great!  Problem solved.   My terminally hangry nine year old told me he could not wait any longer, so I gave him the go ahead to dig in, figuring that he could have the sandwich he ordered for second lunch or an afternoon snack.  Significantly later than our first order, our new sandwiches arrived.  I thanked the driver and then he told me that he needed the original order.  What?  I have never had a restaurant do that before.  If you screw up an order, if you want repeat business, you comp it.  So, I gave the guy the old order, and my kiddo says...\"what do you think they're going to do with it?  Ewwwwww.\"  Honestly, it made me wonder too. Oh, and the replacement order...?  It's still wrong. I highly doubt we will be back, and judging from the rating this franchise currently holds, not a lot of other guests will be either.  Bummer."}
{"text":"2.2 miles down the road and they won't deliver. You have officially lost my business. Not surprising since just about every business in your complex seems to fail."}
{"text":"Food was delivered to the wrong building. Tom, I assume the manager sent out a fresh order and was here in 5 minutes! Thanks Tom"}
{"text":"I threw the sandwich right into the garbage. The young girl who made my sandwich was so rude and mean. Everything I asked for on my sandwich she either told me I couldn't have or gave me attitude for asking. F*ck this place, I like Jimmy Johns but the employees ruin the establishment."}
{"text":"I'd previously left a glowing review but, this latest incident had me not edit it, but, delete all together. I ordered for lunch at 12:50. It is now 1:50 and no food. I have formally requested a refund. I can understand a delay due too weather, but an hour when it's usually 15 mins? I would say avoid this location."}
{"text":"I NEVER write reviews, but tonight I will. I have always had a great experience with Jimmy Johns. Their sandwiches are fresh and service is friendly and quick. Tonight was extra nice because they forgot to deliver my daughters pickle (she loves pickles). We called and made them aware of it, we didn't make a big deal and we told them not to send the delivery guy out again just for a pickle. Monica was very nice and told us they will get it to us on our next visit. About 15 minutes later I hear a knock at the door, it was the delivery guy with our pickle. He said he couldn't not bring it. I felt bad because I did not have money downstairs with me to give him an extra tip so I figured maybe if I write a review thanking him again maybe he would see it. My daughter was happy to have her pickle :)  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Lakewood location is fast and friendly.  We enjoy it pretty frequently.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Jimmy johns is very fast with delivery times. It's my go to if I am really hungry and don't want a wait. The sandwiches are good but employees aren't always the best."}
{"text":"Horrible!!  Ordered a tuna sandwich and my cheese is thicker than the amount of tuna I received. So I complained and they said they can add additional tuna for an additional cost. Very dissatisfied"}
{"text":"Won't deliver 3 miles away.  Lost business.  FYI...with a small child and a baby, sometimes it's impossible to get my butt up and drive 3 miles to get a sandwich."}
{"text":"I am not a big Subway fan, and I try to eat as many Quiznos or Blimpie as possible, but I have to say that even the subway that i dont like is a A LOT better then this Jimmy Johns crap... i wonder how they even open locations in every corner???? WHY would somebody go there?? REALLY!!!! They got NO OLIVES, NO BELL PEPPER, NO SALT & PEPPER. NO HOT/WARM Sandwiches... so what are you selling? just a piece of bread and some meat and some lettuce? that is definetely not a sandwich for me...  IM OUT!!!! I had to eat my sandwich without SALT OR PEPPER almost getting disgusted... I ate it just because I was very very hungry..."}
{"text":"Very nice place for a jimmy johns. I did a pickup with the app and it went great 10/10"}
{"text":"Good healthy food and lightning fast service. Lots of good sandwich and subs with an impressive range of healthy options. Entertaining bathrooms too!"}
{"text":"This place gets worse and worse. I came into put a catering order in. I told them at the store if they could change my pick up time from 2 to 1:30. I also waited for 10 min (they even saw me standing there) while someone actually said, \"is there something else I can help you with\" so I could change the time of the pick up. I even called a few hours later to confirm and they said no problem.  Arrived at 1:35 and they didn't change the pickup time as asked and they had not even started working on my order. This place is the worst. As someone who uses catering several times a week I will be sure to spread the word NOT to use them.  In the end I had to ASK if they would take care of the mistake and they said, I can call and they if I want to come back they will.  Just terrible!"}
{"text":"It isn't necessarily their fault but they won't deliver to my home- they will deliver to the house next door but not my home.... I agreed to meet them at Giant Eagle to get our order. We ordered 2 of the exact same sandwiches (Club LuLu) One didn't have lettuce.... I'm accustomed to the Westlake location which is extremely fast. This took 25 minutes. Not exactly their motto."}
{"text":"I am so sad and disappointed with the service and the sandwich at this location.  We ordered two sandwiches for pickup yesterday at around 5:30. The employess were around 16 and lacking in customer service. Quite rude to us. The Bread was very hard perhaps it was leftover from Friday. The BLT was suppose have extra mayo and the Turkey Tom no mayo and you guessed it the BLT had reg mayo and the extra globs of mayo were on the Turkey Tom.    I am so disappointed...will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"Hey, don't advertise that you deliver when you do not.  I live 1.5 miles away and my address is out of range?  You may want to spend less money advertising about your amazing delivery service and invest in a few cars and drivers."}
{"text":"I've heard a ton about this place. I love sandwiches but try to avoid deli meat, after reading about how bad it can be for us:  The store was very clean and the staff was lovely:   I ordered their Italian sub, and it was made lightning quick. I was in and out in 5 minutes.  Now for the taste. I was very underwhelmed by the sandwich. \"It looks great\" my wife said. So kudos to the employee that made it. But the bread didn't taste really good, nor did it's filling. So sadly, I won't be returning to Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"By the time it takes me to write this review, Jimmy John's could've made 100 sandwiches.  Ok-maybe a slight exaggeration but, as advertised, they are freaky fast.  All of their sandwiches are spot on but the tuna with the hot peppers is my personal fave.  Sure, you will be avoided like the plague walking around with tuna breath but its a small price to pay for a delicious sandwich!"}
{"text":"I really like the sandwiches at Jimmy Johns. I've only been to this location a few times, but they usually have my sandwich ready before i finish paying for it. Only wish I lived close enough for deliveries from here."}
{"text":"There's not much to say that hasn't been said. Not bad drunk food when on State, but there are way better sub places in town. I'd take Milio's over Jimmy John's any day. The bread is way better. Erberts and Gerberts along with Which Wich have fare more options and interesting subs. If this is the only thing open, sure go ahead and eat here. Otherwise check out a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Back when I first moved to Madison, I would get Jimmy John's all the time. I had tried a few other sub shops, but always stuck with Jimmy John's. Now I'm pretty sure that's because it was all I had known pre-Madison. The only sub shop I find worse than Jimmy John's is Silvermine. You should do yourself the favor and go eat at a different sub place. You'll thank yourself.  I really enjoy the staff here though."}
{"text":"Yummy and cheap!  Can't beat that...... the bread is reminiscent of Cousin's bread to me (which I love), but the quality of the meat was waaaaaaaaay better.   This location is close to my work, and parking is easy (and free with validation) in the underground lot at CityScape, so I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A great place to grab a quick bite. The bread is fresh and the price for a sandwich is lower than subway. I always get the turkey Tom whenever I go here."}
{"text":"I had a very frustrating experience that I wanted to share with from Wednesday. I went to the Mesa, AZ (Greenfield/McKellips) JJ store today during the $1 sub promotion. I needed to get 3 for our family and I was fine paying full price for 2 subs when I got to the register. When I went to the register, I explained that I wanted 3 subs and would pay full price for 2. The first time I received my receipt, I was charged full price for all 3 subs. I showed my receipt and got it corrected. When I got home, I realized that I was charged for cheese on the #1, which already comes with cheese. But as frustrating as that is, that's not why I'm writing this review. I'm writing to share my disappointment in the sheer rudeness of the staff.  The lady at the register next to me got yelled at repeatedly. She was unfamiliar with Jimmy Johns and the employee yelled at her \"It's real simple, you can have any from #1 - #5.\" She later asked for black olives and was told \"We don't have black olives, have you never been here before\". One employee tried to push me out of his way while he ran outside in a hurry. When the employees were making the subs, I heard one employee say, \"This is bulls**t\".  I understand that this promotion was very stressful however, it is a promotion JJ fully promoted and endorsed. I was extremely disappointed to have my order rung up wrong, then to get over charged and on top of that, get home to see my subs weren't even prepared correctly.  I wrote JJ's an email about this event and did not get a response. Nothing shows how much the customer matters to a business than to ignore a bad experience. If you ignore it, it'll go away. That's true, my family and I will go away and head straight to the competition."}
{"text":"Freaky fast delivery could not be farther from the truth. Usually takes an hour and sometimes they just forget and I have to call in a ask for my sandwich. And my most recent sub seemed to be 3 or 4 inches shorter then normal. I will not order from here again."}
{"text":"Love this location! The staff is very friendly, it is very clean, good music, and always great customer service!"}
{"text":"I usually enjoy ordering delivery from here since it is so close to my home, however this past delivery was absolutely terrible.  The guy gets to my place 20 mins after my order, usually they arrive in 5-10 mins, as soon as i open my bag there are no chips.  My appetite is gone.   I called jimmy johns and told them the delivery guy forgot my chips immediately I'm put on hold for a min then there is a new guy I'm speaking to.  I don't appreciate being placed on hold as soon as i call without a prompt or that the person was going to get the manager.  They told me he would be on his way with my chips and as i looked at my sandwich i had plans to get on the road to my friends house not be waiting another 20 mins for chips.   I stood there waiting and finally decided to eat my sandwich however it ha dbeen 30 mins and still no chips,  so I called jimmy johns told them to forget about my chips and to put a credit on my account for the chips and lousy delivery service, this was a total of an hour i had waited.  The manager told me he should be there momentarily and i told him well I'm leaving my house like I planned to do an hour ago not wait for chips.  Needless to say i wont be ordering from this location again.   On a side note If I want to order my sandwich my way don't interject and try to get me to buy something else."}
{"text":"Honestly I will probably never order from this jimmy johns again. They gave me the smallest sandwich, it had turkey and I paid extra for roast beef. Literally got 1 slice of turkey and a slice of roast beef, then they just stuffed a bunch of lettuce to make up for it.  What a disappointment, never again. The only reason I'm giving more then 1 star is because the delivery guy was very fast even though it was pouring rain."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's, and am glad to see they now have some in NJ! Every time I've been here, from the time I place my order to the time I have my food, it's been less than 5 minutes.  The food has always been great. My favorite sandwich is the Vito, which is their version of an Italian sub. They also have \"slims\", which are smaller sandwiches for those counting calories. For those not watching their calories, they have giant club sandwiches, and even something called the gargantuan! The people working here always seem to be in a good mood, and have without exception been friendly and competent."}
{"text":"why does this place insist on letting you know how great their delivery is when they only have a delivery radius of ONE MILE? i live two miles from this location and apparently that's just ~too far~ for them.  anyone can have super fast delivery if they only have to drive a mile! the most amusing thing to me is that within a 3 mile radius of my house there are THREE jimmy john's and not one will deliver to me. seriously, it's ridonk."}
{"text":"Doesn't deliver past Cedar road less than .25 of a mile from their location?  Really odd.."}
{"text":"I live 1.6 miles from this location and it's outside their delivery range. So much for freaky fast. :-("}
{"text":"Really? Vegetarian sub with barely any lettuce and it's brown and wilted. Sorry excuse for a sub. When the sun contains ONLY VEGETABLES you should fill it up. And with FRESH produce.  (Posting pics)"}
{"text":"If I could give this jimmy johns less stars I would. They have the slowest delivery time. I called to speak to the manager and told him I ordered 40 mins ago with still no sandwich and the first thing he does is argue about it only being 35 mins ago that I ordered. WHO CARES! Either way it has now been an hour wait with still no sandwich. Manager ought to be fired or reprimanded along with the drivers in hopes that they might be able to get driver who actually know directions and know how to drive. Dont order from here, or if you do beware and realized that you should order an hour or 2 before you are actually hungry."}
{"text":"Hands down best sub place to go to in Tempe. Always super fast, not just regular fast, but super fast....as in my sandwich is waiting for me by the time i get my receipt. Everything on the menu is great. The price is right. It's on Mill Ave and open every time I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Awesome possum! They have always taken good care of my crew. We used to order every Saturday for about fifteen people before new  management provided lunch... They always made us feel special. Sorry guys for no more Saturdays! Can't say no to free lunch! We still love you! Thank you-  Kelsey"}
{"text":"Love Jimmy John's and have been to one in many different states and places...I have NEVER seen one this slow in my life."}
{"text":"They use to deliver to me , but this time the lady said I was on the wrong side of Washburn , I'm literally across the street out of their delivery range . I wont be back to this establishment. This is by far the worst jimmie johns"}
{"text":"Well, it seems like everyone from the mid-west is making their way out to Tempe these days.  I wonder, did Jimmy just come out for my wedding, or does he plan to stay?  No matter, each bite of Bootlegger with hot peppers today was a breath of wonderful, stinky Lake Michigan air.  Arizona needed a good kick in the sub pants by Jimmy Johns.  Most of our sub places here just don't match the quality, speed or service of JJ.  The ham is one thing which stands apart, really, it redefines sub shop ham, as it has more flavor and less gross flimsy questionable content of the usual sub shop ham.  Also, for some reason they have the best Coca-cola here.  No idea how they do it, maybe more syrup or something, but theirs is hands down the best for a chain place.  Writing that kind of grosses me out, but it is true.  The one thing about Jimmy Johns that never totally satisfies me is that they are not the perfect late-night snack but remain open late none-the-less, drawing my more inebriated self in repeatedly just to never fulfill my cravings.  Late night snacks sing to me of hot mashes of cheese, meet and starch (see: burrito, pizza, shwarma) and Jimmy John's cold quality, which is so great and easy for lunch, just doesn't cut the mustard on the chili-cheese fries."}
{"text":"this place is a joke no salt and pepper? and they don't cut the freaking subs. and only deliver to places that are like 20 feet from the business."}
{"text":"Some buds and I ordered these while watching game 4 of the finals.  I ordered the gargantuan with extra peppers and it was delicious.  I felt like I had two points of deli Armageddon in my stomach and almost fell asleep during the second half of the game.  They delivered it too, the order took about 10 minutes after the call to get to us, and it was correct.  $8 for that sandwich that keeps you full all day is amazing!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Although quick, the quality and taste of these sandwiches are far below subpar. This place would best be described as a restaurant that you can go to if you don't want to wait for the restaurant that you really want to eat at that's right next-door."}
{"text":"I have ordered from Jimmy Johns other locations before and usually order extra meat as I am usually real hungry. Tonight I was not starving so I just ordered their regular 8\" sandwich. I cannot believe that it only had 1 slice of Roast Beef on a $6 sub. I guess I know from now on either I need to be real hungry and order extra meat or I just do not order from them again."}
{"text":"Generally, I really like JJ's, but when I went to this one on Hayden Road (my first visit to this one) I immediately noticed it didn't smell that good.  I would have gone somewhere else, but I was running late and didn't have time to make another stop.  And the smell wasn't really terrible, just not too good.  Like it was just overdue for a good cleaning.  The sandwich was good, as usual; but when I got home I checked the Health Department Inspection Reports.  There always seem to be a few minor violations at this location.  Nothing really drastic, but wouldn't it be nice if the could get at least one perfect inspection?  Next time I'm in the neighborhood I'll probably go to the Mexican restaurant a couple doors down."}
{"text":"I was very upset with the service we received from this establishment on St. Rose. We had ordered several times before and they always delivered to is right down the street, barely a mile. But we received a call from a rude employe, stating that we were out of their delivery zone. When we tried to explain our previous deliveries, the employe interrupted several times and talked over us. We told them to keep the food and we are no longer eating at their establishment."}
{"text":"The new Management at this store is great! Memorized my order since I go there regularly! Super fast and always friendly service! Always clean tables to sit at and hang out for awhile:) Fun atmosphere and yummy food! Try the chocolate chip cookies! They're amazing!"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are always very well made, with great ingredients, and fast delivery. My only drawback is their Merry XMas stickers. Not everyone celebrates this holiday and by picking this sticker for your wrapping, you alienate a portion of your clientele. Let's keep it neutral or even just a Happy Holidays."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of the \"Merry X-Mas\" on the wrapping paper.  Not everyone celebrates Christmas and by doing that, you alienate a part of your clientele."}
{"text":"I decided to try JJs over Mr Goodcents.     That was a mistake.   Not much selection, guy at register was nice and helpful but sandwich maker not so much.    The sandwich guy yelled across the store when my sandwiches were done.      I went to get them and they were sitting on the counter below a bar, I waited patiently and he looked at me like I was stupid and said bags are right there if you want one!    I bagged my sandwiches and left.    Sandwiches were blah and they had no Italian or sauce to put on, according to sandwich maker.      I'll be sticking with Mr goodcents or WhichWhich for now in.     I'm not sure what the hype is about at this place.   Also they have no kids meals.    My grandson had a regular size sandwich with 2 slices of ham for $5.99.     Not cool."}
{"text":"I love this Jimmy Johns location!! They always make my food perfect, but more importantly they deliver. Which mean after a long trip and little sleep, I was able to get a sandwich brought to my door within 10 mins. What a deal!!!! Thanks jimmy johns, you're my hero today."}
{"text":"Take out order of 2 sandwiches. Get home, both missing Avocado. Not worth asking for compensation. Review is for future \"buyer beware\" documentation."}
{"text":"This shop exceeded my expectations when it comes to customer service. They brought me the wrong sandwich. I called, they promptly brought me the right kind and gave me a free sandwich coupon for next time. The right sandwich was delicious with just the right amount of toppings. I highly recommend this shop."}
{"text":"I was on Ketosis diet and was looking for some place that offers Low carb food. Came across this and let me tell you their Veg Sandwich on a Lettuce wrap is great. To add up to that, they offer a great nutrition calculator on their website to keep your macros in check. Overall, the lettuce wrap was great in terms of taste and quantity, perfect for a quick lunch even when you're not dieting. ;-)"}
{"text":"After giving this location chance after chance to correct the problem, they have still maintained to let me down. 3rd time an order has taken more than 20 minutes on an establishment thats target is to get order to its customers in 20 minutes or less. Then, just as the other times, when I receive  my order it's wrong! This time my hot peppers, sauce, and oregano were left off which in my opinion makes the sandwich. It was included on the ticket which means that whoever made the sandwich just didn't care. To add my wheat sandwich wasn't cut in half which meant I have to cut it myself with a flimsy plastic knife that I fortunately had in my desk.  I'm just gonna stick to Pita Pit and Panera for my delivery lunch options. At the rate JJ's has been going I'll prob get it in the same amount of time and made the Right Way!"}
{"text":"First time at Jimmy johns, I was wondering why it was empty during lunch? Hmm first clue I made a bad choice. I ordered an Italian night club I think it was called. I asked for double meat and cheese as suggested but I was asked what meat I wanted double? I said the meat it comes with and then I was asked two more times what meat I again said double the meat that comes in it, finally I think they got it but I only got two slices of cheese when I believe they charged me for it since I paid $10 for the $6 dollar sandwich, 2ndly you have to speak what you want on your sndwich as you order as they do not ask you what you want in it the just start making it, lastly to be completely honest with the over all taste, it tasted like a vending machine sandwich, if you're really craving a sandwich head over to port o subs or capriottes their sandwiches are much more worth the cost and they personally do ask you what you want in it and if you ask for double meat which you won't have to as they give you a generous portion and aren't pre made set ups, they will give you exactly double of the meat that goes on that sandwich."}
{"text":"Brandon has greeted me personally the times I visit. Along with all of the others, every time. Very friendly and fast. I wish the people who ran this store would run all of the locations."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are made fresh to order, toppings like lettuce, tomato, onion are free. My favorite is the turkey Tom that's turkey and provolone cheese. There is an 8\" sub for less than $5 or a smaller slim size sub for about $3.75 this one does not include toppings. This location has a drive through and your order is ready super fast! Yayyy"}
{"text":"Great. Fast and nice. Little pricy but good food"}
{"text":"Seriously!?  So I ordered from them twice last week.  Delivery.  They messed up my order just a little (wrong bread) on one of them, eh, no big deal.  The delivery time was OK, but not fast...about 20 minutes.  Well today, I need to leave my house for a job interview at 12:45, so I order at 12:15.  I wait till 12:50, then leave.  My wife is still home... apparently they showed up around 1.  Sorry, but that is not freaky fast, at all!  Then they have the nerve to say I am out of their delivery area.  Then what are you doing?  Did they tell me this and say it make take longer than usual, NO.  Did they decline my order for delivery, NO.   Not to mention why they heck am I out of your delivery range...I live at 87th & Bell - 1 mile from your shop.  I canceled my order and they gave me my money back, but the whole situation is very frustrating!  I love the food and when I have ordered from other locations it is truly freaky fast.  Very disappointed in how this location carries the JJs name."}
{"text":"Why all the bad reviews? They're fast at making sandwiches and I have never had an issue or a problem. It's a fast food chain. Yes, they yell when you walk in the door. It's called \"greeting the customer enthusiastically\".  Would you rather they didn't acknowledge you at all and avoid any sort of eye contact, seemingly intent on rushing you through the already expeditious ordering process? Lighten up."}
{"text":"Placed a large order for a lunch at my office. There was nowhere online to order a side that I wanted, so when I picked up my order I asked if they could possibly do a side, that I was glad to pay for. I was told there was no way they could give me the side that I wanted (just some cherry peppers). I've gotten them many times before, on the side, but for some reason, at this location they refused. I was then told by the man at the cashier that if it were a little slower and if I asked nicely maybe they would do it. Hmmm, could have sworn I asked VERY nicely the first time!!! Then to boot, as I pick up my box and bag of sandwiches while carrying my baby in a car seat, none of the 8 or 9 chivalrous men behind the counter could even help me open the door to go to my car! Avoid this Jimmy John's!!!! I'd give it a  big fat zero if I could!!"}
{"text":"I confess my love for Potbelly, then a Jimmy John's opens up less than a mile from my house.  Its just too damn convenient!  I get it delivered in less than 30 minutes every time.  You can't beat that.  Jimmy John's is convenient, easy and always ready to please.  (That's what she said)"}
{"text":"Since my last review I've ordered several times and each time they were consistently fast and the food was perfect!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here and was surprised that it was so inexpensive. We ordered 2 of the roast beef sandwiches and an Italian. This was our first visit here and while the subs were really good they would of been better heated. The restaurant has an eclectic atmosphere and it is really busy but not in a bad way. Love the bathrooms too when your going to the bathroom."}
{"text":"I'm 2.6 miles from this location and couldn't get a Delivery at 7:30 on a Thursday evening for 12 subs? That's just nuts!  Freaky fast if your only within a mile? But they delivery 2 streets over?  I just picked up a sandwich and it's delicious. But I bet you would have more business if you delivered past you 1.5 mile range!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience here. I got the veggie club. The service was just great! Not to mention my order taker Ryne was cute."}
{"text":"I definitely wished I was at my Jimmy John's on 16th street. Bread not fresh, tiny avocado in between the cheese slices, had to ask where it was, no crushed ice, good music but if it had been different I would have hated how loud it was."}
{"text":"I order from here a LOT as my office is down the street, within about a mile. Sandwiches are fine, the issue I have every time is the delivery service. Sometimes I order in the middle of lunch time, sometimes its before, sometimes its after. More often than not it takes them WAY longer than what anyone would define as \"Freaky Fast\" to deliver it. Not sure what to do at this point as I do enjoy the food for the most part, but just can't always wait an hour (like I did again today) for it to arrive."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's was a staple of late-night drunk food in college, but it made the transition well to sober, white collar lunch break food quite well.  I think I enjoy it more now than I did then.  The meats are sliced fresh daily - not for each sandwich like at Jersey Mike's, but good enough for me.  I only ever ordered a #10 (roast beef and provolone) on French for the better part of 10 years, but a few months ago I switched to the #9 (Italian Night Club), also on French.  The meats are great.  The cheese has flavor, and isn't just a texture item.  The French bread is outstanding.  I disagree with a previous yelper that said it's not flavorful.  For a white bread, it's got a great, nutty flavor to it and is incredibly creamy.  Also, the texture is perfect in my book.  Chewy crust and a tender, yielding middle. MMmmmm...  I was just there today for lunch, as I try to do once a week, and the service is, as they say, so fast you'll freak.  My sub was in front of me before I could get my change in my pocket.  They also have a great line of potato chips.  Great kettle chips in a few popular flavors.  Fun atmosphere, too, with funny signs on the walls.  Can't go wrong..."}
{"text":"Took more than an hour to get one sandwich (ordered at 10:36pm, received at 11:55pm). Totally understand being low staffed- When I called to check on it an hour in they mentioned only having one driver- But a warning would have been appreciated, or the ability to cancel my order after a certain time... Had to force myself to stay awake waiting for it and my Diet Coke had no ice and was spilled all over the cup. :("}
{"text":"While I do love how quick Jimmy Johns is in general, I always thought their sandwiches were pretty mediocre and nothing special. I will continue to order if I am swamped at work at least."}
{"text":"Ordered two subs and had to ask for a bag to carry them in, oh yeah they handed me a bag to do it myself."}
{"text":"You know.... I really wanted to like this place. I've seen the commercials for fast service, which definitely held up to that standard. But I got the veto, and it was alright. I was really excited to have SPROUTS on my sandwich, but they didn't have them. Idk if it's just this location, but I was unfortunately underwhelmed.  3 stars for fast service!"}
{"text":"Honestly the two stars are for how nice the workers were. My #4 Turkey Tom was really depressing and ended up tossing it. The bread tasted stale, and it had to much mayo. I felt it was a waste of money and my time. I'll never go back again."}
{"text":"This place is great! They hooked me up with more hot peppers and they were freaky fast as always. Very accommodating"}
{"text":"Theres little to say other than that I love this place. Cheap, fast, and they deliver. All of the meats, cheeses, veggies, and breads are fresh. Never had a bad customer service experience. The only thing I can really attest to is that they are liberal users of mayo; be aware of that when ordering online and ask for packets instead. :-P"}
{"text":"Waited two hours with multiple phone calls. They were unable to tell me what happened to my order and issued a refund, but said they were too busy to send someone else out for the delivery."}
{"text":"Oh man the smell in here is terrible. It's a mix of BO and piss.  I'm nervous to eat the food with this stank. Customer service is good but damn. Maybe I should have stopped at the Cue Club across the street and get some shots before coming over here and enduring this smell.  Woooofta"}
{"text":"I love a place where the employees learn what regular customers order. So I love that when I walk into Jimmy John's, the sandwich makers usually know I am going to be getting a #12 Beach Club.  Jimmy John's isn't like Subway or Port of Subs where the customer decides exactly what to put on their sandwich. That is ok though, Jimmy John's has a wide variety of sandwiches and you can add things (or leave them off, like I do with the sprouts that come on the #12).  The french bread is delicious and all of their veggies are nice and fresh. Apparently this location delivers and has online ordering, I have never used either service though."}
{"text":"Normally their music is so loud and my husband can't come in because of his tinnitus.  But the last 3 times we came, he was able come in and we ate in because the music was a nice talking level.     On to the food.   It's always perfect.   I always get my sandwich cut into thirds and it's not a problems for them.   Their day old bread to take home is delicious.  Every sandwich is made fast and correctly. The staff is friendly.   You can order their pickles (and they are the best I have ever had) whole quartered in the bucket or.   Buy the bucket once and just get the quarter picked in the future to refill the bucket it's cheaper that way."}

{"text":"When taking a phone order, Blanca was rude, disinterested and I had to repeat my name 3 times after being \"put on hold\" which is just her walking away from the phone.  The bacon on the JJBLT not so great, must have been cooked hours before, because it was hard and dry like cardboard, not \"crispy, fresh or even the slightest bit moist.\" And you only got 2 pieces but lots of  lettuce. (its never like this with the one on Rural Rd & Baseline)"}
{"text":"Won't deliver north past Flamingo? I'm 1.2 miles away. That's probably the biggest joke in the history of delivery. Freaky fast? Try freaky fake. On a serious note, if I'm driving I'm going to Capriotti's. Usually don't give out one stars but Jimmy Johns just lost a big fan"}
{"text":"Delicious as always!  And, as always, I recommend the Italian night club with hot peppers.  It never disappoints.  Staff are friendly too!"}
{"text":"First time coming to a Jimmy John's since moving to Phoenix from NC six months ago. When I lived in NC, I'd go to a Jimmy John's often and always enjoyed it. So, was anxious to try this place out. This location is small compared to other locations I've been to, but not a big deal for me since I wanted to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather.   There was only one other couple in the place when I got there so I was able to order immediately. Got my favorite sub, the #6 veggie with extra tomatoes and added sprouts. Before I could even take 5 photos for Yelp, my sub was ready!! If nothing else, I love how this place is so fast. Definitely, a good spot to eat at or get your food if you're in a rush.   My sub was fresh and was very delicious. One thing I'd change about Jimmy John's is the size of their bread. I always feel like all my veggies are falling out of the sub every time I get one. The bread is really skinny. Other than that, I love the taste of their bread. It was fresh and soft. My sub did seem smaller than other locations I've been to, but that's okay I guess. Another thing I really liked about this location was that they asked me if I wanted my sub cut in half or not. I've never been asked that before and always forget to ask for them to cut it, so it was nice for them to ask.   The two ladies that were making the food weren't particularly friendly, but not mean or rude either. I just kinda like when you go into a place to buy something, that the people working there actually act like they want to be there. The inside of the place was clean and organized as well.   Will be back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, Super Fast service, Delicious tasting sandwich, Clean seating area, and plenty of parking. What else can you ask for?  Came here after making a run to Winco for a quick and easy dinner. It was around 7:30 pm and only 2 other customers in the restaurant. I was greeted by a very friendly lady who took my order quickly and efficiently. As always, I ordered the #13 which is the Gourmet Veggie Club. Normally I ask for extra tomatoes, onions and added sprouts. However this location was out of sprouts, so just got the sandwich the way it normally comes.   I had just sat down so I could write down the cost into my checkbook when they called my order! Wow, seemed like 30 seconds and my food was already out. Now that is what I call speedy service. And unlike a lot of other places when they get your food out quickly, Jimmy John's sandwiches are consistently made correctly and doesn't look like they just threw it together. They take pride in making sure their customers are satisfied with their order.   No fault of theirs, but I always forget to ask for no cheese in my sandwich as they give you so much of it. Other than that, my sandwich was delicious. The bread tasted fresh, just the right amount of mayo and all the fresh tasting veggies that I love.   The seating area was clean and organized. All empty tables were wiped down, chairs neatly situated at their proper tables, drink area was clean, floors swept and free of trash, and the trash was empty.   Will come back again."}
{"text":"Joey & AARON were super nice.  This was my 1st time ever at this location.  And my fort Time ever at a jimmy johns.   Wow what a great place and love the tuna sandwich"}
{"text":"To not give Jimmy Johns 5 stars pains me. As it is one of my absolute favorite sandwich shops and of course the sandwiches are incredible, a favorite being the #12 Beach Club and add bacon. Our experience today was less then ok... solely because of the poor service provided by the counter/order taker Amanda. From the moment we walked in, she looked at us and just couldn't acknowledge us with a welcome, her order taking skills were average however she needs a lesson on using positive body language and dialogue when explaining why they no longer carry sprouts.. not No we don't have them anymore. They're discontinued.   There were several tables that needed to be cleaned and when asked if we could have a table wiped down it was met with a sigh and an inquiry to \"which one\".   With a mix up on our order I had to take my unwich up to be remade, she saw me approach as she stood off to the side and once again she could not acknowledge me.  Instead, someone from the prep line promptly came to assist.  It was only until then did she engage by confirming the order and defensively identified that it wasn't her who had made the error.   She appears to be a pretty unhappy, disengaged employee... customer service is not one of her strong skills.   Im not convinced that you'd want her representing your Jimmy John's brand."}
{"text":"This has to be the WORST sandwich shop in town. I recently went down to their store expecting something good to eat, however I only saw the complete opposite. The food is terribly disgusting, and the produce is not fresh at all. I would have rather spent two extra dollars on Port Of Subs which is down the street rather than have an 8 inch sub made of food that has no quality. It's not only that I had to throw away five bucks on a bland sandwich I didn't finish, but they also have terrible customer service. Definitely would not recommend to anyone. I wish I went home and made my own sandwich, trust me it would've taken me five minutes too."}
{"text":"never order delivery from here. We ordered two sandwiches and it took over an hour and fifteen minutes and we called and they said it's going to be another twenty minutes... we ended the order and got refunded. Absolutely ridiculous and awful customer service."}
{"text":"Their delivery quickness is almost mutant-like. You order and BAM, they're here in 10 minutes. Ridiculous! Their sandwiches are pretty good too. Nothing amazing, but for a $4 Slim with mustard/mayo packets on the side and I don't have to move my ass from my seat all in 10 minutes flat? That sandwich suddenly tastes like a million bucks. Or like $8. Whatever."}
{"text":"I grew up in the midwest just down the highway from the original Jimmy John's- I ate it as a kid, I ate it as an adult, I ate day-old bread from there for sustenance in college.. this was one of those things I accepted losing when I moved out west. But now it's here!  You come here, you get an inexpensive yet large and tasty sub. There are 3 basic categories- the Slims (~$3), with just meat and cheese, the 8\" subs ($4.25), and the Giant Clubs ($5.25) - which in many cases are larger versions of the 8\" subs but sometimes add extra ingredients. If you're feeling brave (and hungry) there's the Gargantuan, which is exactly what it sounds like.  By default, sandwiches are served on crusty but chewy French bread- it's what I crave most about the place and nobody else really matches  it- it's chewy on the outside but squishy on the inside and flattens around your sandwich quite well. You can also opt for the 7-grain on a Giant Club sandwich.  My hands-down favorite? The Beach Club- turkey, cheese, guac, cucumber, sprouts, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I hope they start delivering across the i-10, because this place truly shines when they deliver- their motto is \"Subs so fast you freak\", and I haven't been let down in the past.   You will like this place if a) you're in college or b) you appreciate a fast and cheap yet high-quality sandwich."}
{"text":"I love this place I have been a Jimmy John's fan for the past two years and they are wonderful sometimes they made mistakes but they are so sweet about it and they will always correct it without making you pay and they will deliver it again anytime their sandwiches are delicious my very favorite is called the JJ Gargantuan it's got so much meat it's like something that you want to share with your partner or best friend they are delicious so I'm a quite addicted to them so I would recommend them to anyone I think they I love Subway don't get me wrong but there are completely in a different element and I would prefer them to Subway any day thanks Jimmy John's!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I stopped in for a sub. I love Jimmy John's by the way. There were 3 employees working. A guy and two females. I'm a happy person and smile at everyone. I ask people how their day is going. None of the employees would smile or act like they even remotely liked their job.  In my opinion, not very good customer service.  My food was great as always."}
{"text":"Sometimes they deliver, sometimes they say, \"Corporate says we don't have to.\" Consistency would be nice. Stinks, because we do enjoy the food...."}
{"text":"I was overjoyed recently to see that a new Jimmy John's had opened in my neighborhood.  Sweet!!!  No longer would their tasty, delectable sandwiches be a once in a while treat for me, since the closest shop was a 20 minute drive to the location near UNLV.  This new store is located in the Target plaza on Lake Mead just east of 95.    I've been to the shop twice since it opened.  Both visits were pleasant and service was quick though there was a line of customers both times (why wouldn't there be?).  On my first visit, I ordered the \"Vito\", Italian meats on a fresh, delicious sub roll.  It was perfect!   On the second visit I encountered a problem with my sandwich, but to my dismay, it was only after I got home.  I wasn't about to bring it back...That time I had ordered the #9, \"Italian Night Club\" I'm sensing a theme here....  It normally comes with mayo on it, so I specifically asked for no mayo twice to the person taking my order.  Just to be sure I wasn't hallucinating, I double checked the order ticket, and sure enough, it said \"NO MAYO\" but, oh boy, was there mayo on it.  Figuring that a new restaurant would definitely want to know about service issues, I called and spoke to the manager.  She was apologetic and grateful to have been informed about the problem.  She offered to make good by giving me another sandwich which I gladly accepted.  Let's face it, I'd go back to Jimmy Johns no matter what, but the fact that my sandwich \"problem\" was handled so pleasantly left a good taste in my mouth about this location!"}
{"text":"Never been to one. Doubt I'll ever request Jimmy John's.  I asked for my gargantuan to be cut. It wasn't. Asked for sugar and they had 1 packet left.  They didn't have it out, I had to ask for sugar. I'll stick the places I know I like."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are bland, the bread is like wonder loaf. The service was just awful five guys yelling at each other. Just don't understand the hype."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns. They never disappoint. Same great sandwiches wherever you go. I usually get the Turkey Tom. All my kids love it too. My daughter tried the Vito but she thought it was to spicy."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite lunch spots for two reasons. The first being its always freaking delicious and they are always quick. The second being gazing into Dustins pretty blue eyes when he makes my sandwiches. The end."}
{"text":"I'm giving them a 5 because the driver was super polite and the food delivered freaky fast as their slogan promises.  Both subs were made correct as I ordered.  Pickles were quartered as I requested.  Only downside was I ordered online and the website was acting freaky slow.  It wouldn't let me correct the address I had mistyped by just one number so I ended up having to type in \"specific instructions\" form-field-box thing at check out the correct number.  This was my error, not theirs, the driver found the place all ended well.  Prices are reasonable and service is great.  Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"I frequent this location as it is close to my house. I happen to love the Italian sandwich and it's cheap too!  However, you better like it just the way they make it (and that's with or without peppers) as you can't get it any other way. I like hot peppers on my Italian sandwiches but only in small doses so I asked for them in the side so I can ease my wuss self into the pepper zone properly but....can't get em or anything on the side when it comes to the sandwich. You can't add mayo if it doesn't normally come with mayo.    Ok, now I still like the Italian without the peppers too but my kids, they don't like all that stuff on their sandwiches.  Well guess what?  Can't customize sandwiches at all, so you gotta order a \"slim\" which is meat and cheese and bread. I asked for a slim with mayo, nope....but they can give you a mayo packet to apply the mayo yourself.  Okay....  Now,back to the fact that all sucks...the taste of the sandwich and cost of the sandwich are good, thus earning three stars. Plus they are turbo fast at getting the sandwich into your hand (because....no changes)!  You dint get a sack or napkins unless you ask, but that's no big deal I guess.  For better tasting sandwiches at higher price and longer wait, try Capriottis or which wich.  It all depends on your budget and time available"}
{"text":"Why are you closed before 8:30 on a Thursday night? Why don't you deliver to people that live within 2 miles of your location? Seems like you're kissing money away. Desert ridge location is a couple of miles away and will now have all of my money now! Which is sad because I truly love the idea of having one so close to our house."}
{"text":"So there's been this craze and talk about a place called Jimmy Johns, and I really had no flippin idea who they were or what it was..All I knew is that I \"MUST HAVE IT\" according to their biggest fans and sub connoisseurs lol.  I've now tried two of the menu items...#5 and the #10 both are sooo good. It's a nice place and alternative to go to instead of the played out pizza joint when the bars let out. And for a 8inch sub it cost you anywhere from $4.35 to $5.35. That's a great deal!"}
{"text":"Fastest sub I ever had. However the sub was not good. Ive had better subs at the supermarket. Not much else to say. Ordered here twice, two different subs and it was the same both times."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's sandwiches, and this is the fastest one I have ever been to.  I stopped by for lunch today and ordered a veggie sub, and my sandwich was ready before I walked to the end of the counter to get it!  And this was at 12 noon; they were pretty busy.  I am definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"We don't have Jimmy John's in California, so I knew we have to have it while we in IL on vacation. Quick, delicious sandwiches with a friendly staff. I wish they had one of these in California - I would probably eat there every day!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and fast, delicious sandwiches.  Jimmy John's is the standard by which I judge all other sandwich shops.  The Country Club ranks high on my list but I've never had anything there I didn't love.  They really do a great job.  While a lot of other sandwich shops try to give you what you want with a build your own sandwich setup, or piles of meat, Jimmy John's gives you the sandwich you should have ordered. :-P  Top it off with a fun environment that makes it enjoyable to stay and eat and this gets my full five star endorsement.  It beats every other shop in town in at least one or two aspects.  Damn.  Now I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"Staff was unfriendly bordering on rude on the phone and not helpful when I picked up. You can't have items on the side and they said the napkins are at the counter - then watched me look for them without comment. Another gentleman came and asked for napkins and he pointed them out - they were behind the counter where I would think only employees would reach. Why wouldn't you just put some in the carryout bag? Not impressed with the service."}
{"text":"So fast you will wonder why you didn't make it yourself.  This location is clean and the staff very friendly. I have been in at least 10 times and never had an issue. I do wish they would expand the menu, thereby giving me more time to ponder the choices before eventually settling on the veggie sub."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying jimmy johns & it was absolutely delicious!! They were so fast & friendly I have no complains! Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Love LOVE the food!  Love the price!  Love the selection but this place is SO loud with music THEY CAN control ... it would make me think twice before coming back!  They have it cranked, they can not hear the customer, we can not here them and it is crazy!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars cause of the fact that my job is 1.4 miles away and they refuse to deliver. I understand the \"freaky fast\" delivery they offer but id rather wait an extra 5 mins for my sandwich since I can not leave work to go pick it up. I love their sandwiches but they just lost a huge order and future orders as well. Not to mention the 20 dollar tip"}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm going to give it 5 stars, because why not?  When I don't feel like cooking or waiting in line at another \"fast food\" restaurant or sitting down to order an expensive meal, Jimmy John's is my go-to meal.  I'm not even going to call it a guilty pleasure, because I don't feel even a little bit guilty about this pleasure.  Seriously.    I don't think I've had to stand in this restaurant for more than 5 minutes, including ordering.  #5 with salt & vinegar chips.  Maybe 2 bags of chips.  If they sold party or family sized bags of those deliciously sour and salty chips, I would buy them in bulk - damn my figure.  Oh, and the employees are always smiling and cheerful, regardless of the day.    I do wish they were open later (they're only open til 9pm...so at least til 10pm, or 2am would make this Jimmy's my second home) and I REALLY wish that they delivered farther than the small area they deliver to.  I only live about 4 miles away, and I'm outside of their delivery zone.  I guess this is what's keeping me from being the ultimate lazy-ass though...having to physically drive to pick up my sub.  It will always be worth it."}
{"text":"While I wouldn't say this location is \"Freaky Fast\", they weren't slow at least. Inside felt really humid and my husband said it smelled like moldy bread. The food was on par for Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"they suck at making online order swear that can read the screen or dont care to it sad and a waste of money"}
{"text":"This place suck with online ordering and not only that they have problem with give you what you paid for and want you to deal with their crappy sandwich. Order at my house don't get any problems then want jimmy John for lunch for work a the asshole wont make my sandwich right and I'm paying $15 a day for lunch can someone respect the fact I love jimmy John and just want what I order. Their worst with online order and the manger their sucks    (It's not freaky fucking fast it's slow like ordering a pizza )"}
{"text":"Super crazy fast delivery .  I timed it and after I hung up the phone I had sub in hand in 5 min 48 second? The sub was just ok . Their are better sub shops around that aren't franchised but if you don't want to drive and want a fast delivery this is your spot"}
{"text":"This review is for an online order for delivery fulfilled by this location.  My co-worker and I were hungry today. She decided to get delivery from Jimmy John's, so I ended up adding on to her order (and paying for it when she wasn't looking). As reported by the web site and the delivery driver's receipt, this is the location that took care of our order.  We asked them to deliver to a location just on the other side of St Rose Pkwy, and the delivery employee arrived 15 minutes later and had me sign for it. Decent timing, nothing to complain about there.  #8 Billy Club ($6.97): roast beef, smoked ham, provolone, Dijon mustard, lettuce, tomato, mayo. Let's start with the good part of my order. The wheat bread that I requested was soft and quite flavorful. The sandwich was a mouthful as a whole. The extra cucumber (complimentary add-on) brought some much needed crunch and freshness.  There was plenty of negatives though. The meat tasted too much of deli meat, in the school cafeteria bologna kinda way. That would've been enough for a 3 star review if my co-worker hadn't pointed out that her cucumber add-on request was seemingly ignored. So I examined mine more closely and realized that they barely had any sprouts (or left them off entirely) despite my request for a extra large add-on of sprouts, and they also omitted the onions that I'd asked for. Not only did they botch the order, but they really made the meal worse because the deli meat needed as much help as it could get.  Delivery possibilities aside, I will stay away from Jimmy John's from now on if they're just going to screw up orders of what are already mediocre ingredients. There are too many great sandwiches, chains and otherwise, for me to risk it."}
{"text":"Love this place. Come in here at least two times a week for lunch since it's so close to my office. Club Lulu on wheat or the Vito, both with hot peppers. The restaurant is clean and they live true to their motto of subs so fast you'll freak."}
{"text":"Visited store yesterday and the place was dead. No one there. When I walked through the door no one person welcomed me at all. The guy at the register had a bad attitude and it showed. When we left not one person said that you for coming, nothing. I have been to other locations and they don't treat customers like this. They have happy employees but this location does not."}
{"text":"Sandwiches at Jimmy's place.  With a nice hangover And a belly that needed to be reload of normal food, we headed over to Jimmy johns for some much needed sustenance.  Now I've been to JJ before and I've had a few great experiences but this time I was a little disappointed. Ordering the Beach club sandwich I found the bread to be dry, a little unusual but meh I plowed on, getting through the sandwich I really found it to be really bland and not to the JJ standards that I had experienced before.   Maybe it was a off day for JJ and myself but I will try them again but I won't go out of my way when you got quite a few good places in such close proximity!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to go to jimmy johns 2-3 times a week considering my schedule is hectic and they are all over the place and typically quick when going inside to order. I had an absolutely awful experience with this location over a year ago when I ordered delivery for the first time and it took 1.5 hours even though I live less than a mile away. They made excuses about delivery drivers (I see this is common in other reviews) and when the sandwich finally arrived the driver made me go outside to meet her because she didn't want to walk up the stairs. The sandwich was smashed and soggy and I never ended up eating it (Hadn't been to Jimmy Johns since that happened and I was a 2-3x per week customer, but was thoroughly grossed out and disappointed) Today I decided to give them another try and ordered again. Took 30 minutes (which is fine but they shouldn't say \"freaky fast\" considering how close i live), I start eating the sandwich and realized it's the wrong one. Nothing is right about it so I call and let them know. He said they will have the right one made but make sure I give the sandwich back to them (weird, but ok). They came and gave me the new sandwich and took the old one. About minutes later the manager or someone else called and had the audacity to say \"for future reference you can't eat any of the sandwich and it has to be returned how it was delivered\"... Excuse me that I didn't plan on it being wrong and ate some of it and realized it was not what I got. Very rude and unprofessional. I won't be going there ever again or ordering delivery. Last 2 experiences with this specific place in scottsdale has been absolutely awful."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Jimmy John's sandwiches. I've been to many different locations and this one is by far the most consistent at making my sandwiches wrong. When I order something as simple as \"no mayo, no onions, add hot peppers,\" I end up with mayonnaise, no tomatoes and no hot peppers. The sad fact is that the order takes my order correctly, therefore it's either a literacy or lack attention problem. They apologize profusely, but I shouldn't have to take my sandwich back to the counter every time I dine in.  I've spoken to the manager, I have even emailed corporate, but the problem persists. I guess I'll go down the street to Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"We just stopped here as Slices no longer exits at TMP :(  For JUST cold meat sandwiches...they are over priced. Short variety and more than $3 for some salame, cheese in average white bread.....no thank you."}
{"text":"Until this moment, this day, I have yet to have an unappealing experience with jimmy johns but today was the day. First when we walked in they neglected to acknowledge my girlfriends and I with their warm welcomed \"HEY!\" And to add onto this after we got our sandwiches at the typical fast rate the first bite was far from subpar the bread felt like a brick it was so stale and over toasted. They also neglected to give us our pickle we ordered. However, the worst part by far was when my girlfriend bit into her sandwich she noticed something and after close evaluation I discovered a small amount of mold in the sandwich. I'm very disappointed as this was my favorite sub stop shop."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that Jimmy John's has come to the Valley. They offer good sandwiches at good prices.   I have been to JJ's many times in MN and this JJ's is just as good. I went there for lunch today and the place was busy but the staff didn't seem overwhelmed. I ordered a #4 Turkey with cheese and my sandwich was in my hands very quickly. The bread was nice and soft, the ingredients tasted fresh and it had just the right amount of mayo- not too much, not too little. And the sandwiches are an ample size - 8 inches.   All together the sandwich and chips (no drink) came to just over $5. Almost a dollar less than Silver Mine subs (where I usually go). Sorry Silver Mine, I've got a new favorite sub shop.   One downside - the place is tiny. Not many places to sit, especially if you are with a group of three or more."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a Club Lulu w/ cheese - that's been at five stars in my book since I first discovered Jimmy Johns in college (Columbia, MO).  This review is specific to the experience I had at this Las Vegas location.  I called for delivery, but was shot down by a rude female who said my location was out of their one-mile radius delivery range even though the borderline intersection she mentioned was outside the apartment I was visiting. Despite trying to explain this to her, she would not back down and so I didn't place an order.  Going over the options of what to do (e.g. walk or drive), I decided to call back one last time. As I hoped, a different worker answered the phone. Although he did mention that my intersection was the furthest they go for delivery, he heard me out and placed my order. It's because of that fine human being that I got my Club Lulu w/ cheese delivered."}
{"text":"The delivery was \"freaky fast,\" and the sandwich was as ordered with some specials. No napkins is the loss of max score."}
{"text":"Great subs! Restaurant was super clean, every employee was genuinely kind and attentive. Something about their bread is just really delicious. Highly recommend oil and vinegar with light mayo on just about any sandwich here. As a family we really appreciate a great sub from time to time and this place has them. If you're ever in the area I'd give it a chance. Will definitely be having JJ's again real soon."}
{"text":"They always make me a good sandwich I can't complain about anything. Delivery was fast. The cookies are soft and fresh. Great lunch every time thanks staff members at jj"}
{"text":"Couple issues here team.  1. We got 'rooked on the drinks. 3/4 of the cup was ice. C'mon! Two gulps and the drink was gone. If this is a cost savings thing... Bruh, wrong way to go about it.  2. When someone says \"hold _____\" that means please don't put that item in the sandwich! That's how allergy issues happen... Or I vomit because I bit into a tomato. No fun.  3. Get the right name on the right sandwich.  Were the sandwiches good? Overall yes, which is why you got the 3 stars. But these little details is what puts you over the top."}
{"text":"I have tried this location 3 times and twice they have messed up! The first time they forgot my drink and wete 30 mins late, and because the driver forgot the drink in his car and was on other deliveries they said sorry do you want a credit for the soda? I laughed and said no I wanted my drink! I never got it! Then tonight my sandwich was all wrong, no lettuce (that comes on it) then no sprouts that I added weren't there, as well as the extra guacamole I paid $2 extra for was literally a teaspoon of that! I called and complained and yes they did return with my new order and asked for the other sandwich back. Well then I bite I to my new sandwich and it had a very long black hair in it, so disgusting!!! I'll never order again from here!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but service is horrible at the St Rose/Eastern store. They don't listen to any of your requests. Then when we asked to have it fixed, they told us we needed to ask for it when we ordered, which we did. Just not worth the hassle. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"If I could give less stars I would. The bad reviews should have warned me but I live half a mile down the street and didn't want to load up the kids in the car or order pizza. So I decided to order delivery.  It took an hour and when I called after 40 minutes they told me they left within 15 minutes of my order and only had one other delivery before me. Something's wrong here! I will never be back."}
{"text":"Every time I order delivery from this location, my order is wrong. Customer service is lacking--there was a definite tone of annoyance at my wanting my BBQ chips delivered since they weren't brought with my original order, but I paid for them and I would like to eat them. I don't think I've ever had an order come from this Jimmy Johns that was 100% correct. It's a shame because the food is tasty."}
{"text":"Scumbag move of the day goes to Jimmy John's store #2311 (9985 S. Eastern Ave #100). Ivica and I left the office to grab a couple sandwiches, where, there was a homeless teenage kid with a tiny dog standing outside under the overhang (since it's raining heavily today). Kid wasn't even asking for money (granted there was a sign on his suitcase that said \"anything will help\"). Well before I could buy the poor kid a sandwich, they had called Henderson PD on him, which, if anyone knows these cops, they'd probably arrest him and he'd never see his dog again. Fortunately, I don't think they found him. Bottom line - you're a collection of low life scumbags and I'll be damned if you ever get any of my (or my companies) business ever again."}
{"text":"Slow making subs and service was far from perfect. The bread seemed to sitting out for quite some time so the bread was hard. As well as the music was way too loud I felt like I had to almost shout to be heard to place the order. Even then the order was made incorrectly.  When I kindly approached the guy at the register he seemed to have an attitude.  I am a big fan of Jimmy John's. However this location has a lot to work on in the area of customer service.  It will be awhile before I'm back at this location."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and the bacon tasted like feet. Had a very funky after taste and looked like the pre packaged microwavable kind and it didn't help that it was cold. I understand it was a cold sub but the bacon looked raw.  I will not be back. Makes subway look good"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Jimmy John's. This location is a mile or so from my house and is on constant standby for nights when the wife and I are out of groceries or are too lazy to cook. We get out the computer, punch in our order, wait fifteenish minutes, and the food is at our door. It really doesn't get much easier. I love the ultimate porker, with flavorful ham and salty bacon, it hits the spot every time and always makes me wish I had three more... add onions and avocado to it and I'm drooling. If you visit the store be warned, the music is loud and the staff is at times in such a rush that they almost seem unfriendly, but that's the point of the place, a ridiculously wonderful sandwich at lightening speeds, and that's exactly what you'll get... they may not win awards for service, but man is that a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Worst customer service! The manager, LEVY, was extremely rude. Staff unfriendly and seemed to hate their job. GET NEW STAFF. What a shame because the food is usually good."}
{"text":"This JJ's is the best one ever!!  They are always perfect with my orders (even if its my whole store's lunch order!). They are super nice and just great!!  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Sandwich was out in less than a couple minutes. Always fresh, staff is usually friendly. It's filling, but a tad overpriced thus the dock of one star. BUT this is my go to sandwich place that I love and cherish."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to this Jimmy Johns location and I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed in what I got. First off, the bread was stale and not like the soft Jimmy John bread that I know. Secondly, I had the tuna which was tasteless and really watery. Most definitely not the best tuna sandwich I've ever had and maybe even the worst. Perhaps the tuna sandwich isn't the way to go for Jimmy's but as far as their quality of food, this location needs to step up their game."}
{"text":"Oh, JJ's. Where do I even begin?  Well, to start painting the picture here, I really (I mean really) hyped you up to my beloved BF yesterday afternoon. Crazy raved about your bread quality and taste, over-generous portions of meats, and loved that you pushed the envelope by offering taboo alfalfa sprouts.  My rep was on the line, as BF pulled into this location to treat me to dinner last night. Your location has a neon sign that says \"Free Smells\", right? I was rather giddy to showcase this, but alas, this location literally smelled like a post \"dropping the kids off at the pool\" type of situation. Not exaggerating here, or trying to be mean. It did, Jimmy John's. :(  Okay, so ordered our sammy's, and I wanted the jalapeno chips as they weren't out on display. The cashier fetches them from behind counter. No prob, but wouldn't you think that proper inventory zoning wld catch this? But what do I know?  Sammy's are ready but are tiny. Tiny. Here I was gushing about how high these magical sammys would be and they were THIN. Hardly any meat like they were around 2010 or 2011. And NO effing sprouts?! JJ - I ordered the #4, which is turkey with alfalfa sprouts!! I went back and requested these be put on, but I should not have had to do this. Right?   My BF and I bought sodas also. Why, oh why, are your straws and lids at top of soda dispensing machine? It's counter-intuitive, IMO. Why no napkins?? We had to WAIT until mayo was smeared on our paws and lips to visit counter again for them to cough up friggn napkins?  My BF wasn't impressed w/bread either. Granted, he's VERY biased and spoiled as he just relocated from San Francisco and has had easy access to scrumptious sourdough, but still...I believe our total bill was around $16 or $17. Very high and not cool.  Sounds like JJ's is penny-pinching the overhead which is ultimately causing a poor customer experience. Tres disappointing, I must say. Will not be back."}
{"text":"As a flight attendant, I have been to many Jimmy John's and this one is not up to par. I ordered the gourmet Veggie sandwich. The bread was great. The insides were anything but gourmet. The gal making the sandwich was very frugal when putting veggies on my sandwich. Plus they were not as fresh as I would have liked. And the avocado spread, I thought she had forgot to put it on, but I did find a faint trace of spread in between the cheese slices. Will not visit this Jimmy John's again."}
{"text":"I am so thankful this Jimmy Johns location has re-opened. My office frequented Jimmy Johns for a while often times making the few blocks walk down Charleston Blvd for lunch. Then we started ordering online and having it delivered. Partly we did it because we're lazy. Partly because it is quick and easy. And there is no outrageous delivery fee. We were so saddened by the closing of this store. I saw they were remodeling and that provided us with some glimmer of hope. But it seemed so long between the closing and the eventual re-opening. It was disheartening to say the least. Nevertheless they did open the doors once again and we have resumed our ordering of their sandwich masterpieces. Recently I took my dad in for his first Jimmy Johns experience. I've got him hooked now. We both got the same sandwich. A Jimmy Johns Gargantuan with all the fixings including hot peppers. The roast beef, turkey, salami, tomatoes, lettuce, onion etc all crammed into the chewey bread is a hard sandwich to beat. And with the new expanded store it is a pleasure to dine in now. The previous version was small and cramped beyond and reasonable comfort level. The new version 2.0 of this location is more open and inviting. The staff is great and as they say, Jimmy Johns is \"Freaky Fast.\""}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location a few times recently and it has been a good experience each time. I usually order the #11 Country Club which is delicious! The Jimmy chips are crunchy and have great flavor. No matter how busy it has been when I have been in this location they get my sub out within 5 minutes or less. Great! I only wish that they had a few other pepper options, jalapeno's, green peppers etc... But then again the simplicity makes Jimmy John's fast and delicious!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I never heard of JJs until I moved to Surprise from Texas. I was unpacking so I ordered a sub and had it delivered. The sub was good and liked the price for a quick lunch I didnt have to go out and get myself. So the a day or two later I order another one for lunch and it was still good. Now you might be saying \"Well if you had 2 and they were good why the 1 star?\" Well thats a great question. Around dinner time on the same day I decide I want another one because why not be lazy. I get it, eat it, enjoy it. 3am comes by and I vomit all over my bed without warning. I then go on to vomit every 15 minutes for the next three days (I wish I was kidding) I only had those two sandwhiches that day so I have to assume it was one of them that did me in. So yes I did like JJs, but when you dont go back because you feel sick to your stomach even when you see one of there delivery cars, thats not a good thing. Eat at your own risk I suppose."}
{"text":"When they say, \" Freaky Fast Delivery\" they aren't kidding!  Wow- I'm amazed by how quickly they delivered my delicious sandwich!"}
{"text":"So odd to see so many negative reviews for this location..   I work close by, but can't leave for lunch so I order online.  I've ordered at least 4 times in the past couple of weeks.  Every order has been delivered earlier than my requested time and my order has always been fresh and correct.   Today I even commented to my driver that they really are just like the commercial, it took me longer to place my order than to get it!   Thanks for the great service keep it up!"}
{"text":"So many times I have placed the order here.  Service is bad.  Guys are rude.  Then comes delivery times... There is always an excuse that today I have less drivers,  we have too many deliveries... It's always 45 min to delivery.  Excuses...  UPDATE: 2 hours.  No delivery.  Extremely Rude guy on the line.  I called and said I wanted to place a new order but for tomorrow.  Given its taking that long.  He is here after 2.5 hours."}
{"text":"What can I say, a simple sandwich with fresh baked bread!? Good and simple all the time! Gotta love JJ!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever, it's like I was a burden ordering. It was fast though! They couldn't wait for me to leave. Dude literally set the sandwich on the counter without saying anything to me or making eye contact. I said thanks and I got a \"uh huh.\"  Classy. Plenty of other sandwich options around, and this sandwich sure as heck isn't good enough to go out of your way for. Uh huh."}
{"text":"Housesitting less than 2 miles away and according to manager I'm out of their delivery zone lol Dear Jimmy John's Corporate.... get a clue on \"service\""}
{"text":"Truly exceptional service and delivery! As someone who orders here 5-6 times a week, I can vouch they are on point with their subs! Always speedy and friendly service, and great food! Always torn between the Vito and the Ultimate porker, both so good! Thanks and keep up the excellent experiences and lunches!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Meat. Terrible.  Terrible. Dressing. Terrible.  Corporate Garbage that Sand Paper Palette Eating People really like.   NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This location refuses to deliver to me even though they have in the past and I am far closer to them than the far range of their delivery circle. I happen to be stuck between two locations and both refuse to deliver!"}
{"text":"SO RUDE!! I love jimmy johns! But this location I've never felt like such a burden! I thought it was just the one worker but then the person who gave me my order was a complete jerk! And they threw my bag like they were so annoyed i was there. I will NEVER go to this location again. I felt so stupid being there and I was the one giving them business! I was trying to be nice and I was not being picky or demanding or anything I just ordered and they were so rude. So so rude. The management need to give their workers a happy pill or find new ones because nobody deserves to be treated like that!"}
{"text":"DO NOT ODER FROM THIS LOCATION. I love Jimmy Johns and I've experienced them in several different states. This is BY FAR the absolute WORST location I've ever encountered. Every single time I order from here whether delivery or pickup, something (everything) goes wrong. Same with my roommates. The order has been wrong every single time. Examples in addition to the wrong food: deliverer cursing me out for having trouble finding my house; delivery showing up over an hour late (this location is less than a mile from my house); not cutting the sandwich; no napkins; no mayo/mustard; delivery never showed up; extremely rude workers; one guy hung up on me before I even completed my order. Just don't. Worst customer service you'll ever experience. Subway sucks but in comparison to this location, at least you'll get what you paid for."}
{"text":"Looking at my check in history, I go to JJ a lot (once a week). Wow. I usually get a totally tuna on white. At 700 calories a piece, I'm surprised I'm not bigger. They make great chips, but I try to avoid them. Even though I know this meal is very calorie dense, I can't stay away. The employees are friendly and I can be in/out in under 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Just got THE WORST delivery service from Jimmy John's. Placed my order at 11:13 am and received it at 11:55 am. I am about 10 blocks away so I called the store after waiting 20 minutes.  I was told the order had just 'popped up on their screen' and was on the way. I called again after 10 more minutes. I was told it should arrive 'any second' now and that the driver had several orders to deliver. Finally got my order after another 12 minutes at 11:55. I asked the driver how long my order had been out in the car for delivery and was told 'I don't know'. FREAKY S L O W !!!   The receipt showed the order was placed at 11:13 am."}
{"text":"Every time I order here (delivery) they get to my house in 6-10 minutes! The delivery crew are always friendly and my order is always right! I use the app and I love it :)"}
{"text":"Jimmie John's is my quick go to for a sandwich. They have fresh ingredients, perfectly cooked bread and great sandwich options. I also love that they have a breadless option. Since this is a major chain I want to focus my review on the specific location.  The restaurant is always clean, which is nice. However two of the times I've been there during lunch they were mopping the floor. One of the times I was sitting in a booth facing the window with my headphones on. I didn't notice the girl had mopped and when I stood up to leave I nearly slipped and fell. I appreciate the attention to cleanliness, but I think there is a time to do it and that time is not during your major lunch rush.   One of the biggest disappointments I the lack of tea. Maybe it's because I'm from the south, but the only tea option they have is a Fuze flavored tea. This feels like a MAJOR miss. The space on the counter where the tea would normally go is completely empty so it isn't a matter of space.   The staff is always friendly. And it's Jimmie John's so of course they are also fast. My go to is a Vito, no bread, add mayo. It's not too off the menu, but every single time the people making my sandwich ask me \"what did you want to add\" or \"did you want the\". This is the only location I've ever been to where this happens. Again, I appreciate they are making sure it's made correctly, but isn't my order on the ticket?   All in all I walk out with what I wanted (minus the tea) so it's not a bad experience. I just feel there is a slight room for improvement compared to the other Jimmie John's locations I've visited."}
{"text":"Well, after giving in to the hype, I finally got my butt into a JJ's.  Um, I have to say, I'm not quite sure what the magnetic draw is.  Yes, they have friendly staff, and I'd say their bread is better than similar competing chains, but all in all I'd put it in the same category as Silver Mine subs, which is basically a tasty sandwich, but nothing to write home about.  Check them out for a solid sub sandwich if that's what you're craving...but don't expect anything too different."}
{"text":"Is it the GREATEST SANDWICH ON EARTH? Hell no! But it's fast and inexpensive with crisp-tasting ingredients, and served on really fresh, good-quality bread. It is very good. Service is quick and efficient and the restaurant is clean. The menu is easy to maneuver and I hear they deliver, too."}
{"text":"I like Jimmy Johns, and have for over 20 years (growing up in the midwest).  But this location is terrible!  I work nearby and we order sandwiches 2-3 times a week, and more often than not they screw something up.  Today I ordered a beach club with no tomato or cucumber add bacon, and got a beach club with extra tomato, no mayo and no guacamole.  on top of that they charged $2.50 for bacon.  I am fine paying for extras, but $2.50 seems high for bacon, especially if they leave off guacamole!  If this were the first time it happened I would let it slide, but it is literally over 50% of the time my order is wrong.  With the amount of restaurants around, and the mediocrity of jimmy johns I have decided I will not order from this location."}
{"text":"Eat here a few times per week. Food is good and service is \"freaky fast\" prices are reasonable and staff is all very friendly. Good alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"I'm so glad they opened this location!  This place is near my house, and before this, I had to drive all the way over to the one on Rainbow.  The establishment here is always clean, and the employees really understand what customer service is, and why it's important.  There sandwiches are far superior to Subway, and the extra price is completely worth it."}
{"text":"Location: Few options to get a quick sub on Grant Street in Historic District. This is one of them.  Restaurant: They always shut down the bottom floor when they can. This place gets hit in waves due to business crowds.   Food: It's Jimmy Johns. They're philosophy is fast food. It is established under a quick productivity system. The food comes out slow for the design. The toppings are basic and they get edgy when you ask for cucumbers or to sit on the bottom level.  Service: These people aren't infused with a drive and desire to make your sandwich with a smile. They seem lethargic and unhappy. It's a bit depressing to go there and I recommend delivery which takes a while.  Overall: If you have to but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Not as good as Tempe @ Elliot & Kyrene, but still the fastest sandwiches in the West & I looooovve the bread!"}
{"text":"I drove here earlier in the week because I really wanted a sandwich.  I'd like to say the servers behind the counter were very nice but Jimmy John's does not give you the option of heating meat.  I had never been here before so I did not know that!  I am pregnant so I had to leave without anything because you can not eat lunchmeat unless it is thoroughly heated to get rid of any possibilities of listeria.  (Listeria can cause miscarriages and mostly pregnant or elderly are prone to listeria.)  Anyways, I was very disappointed because I was hungry!  I can't believe they can't heat meat.  I mean even Scrubway and Quizno's heats meat!"}
{"text":"This place has always been good to me... Fast service and healthy options."}
{"text":"I've been here a half dozen times. Always get the Beach Club which is turkey, avocado and veggies. The bread is fresh and tasty. Staff is fast and friendly. They are open late and deliver. I prefer Jersey Mike's subs, but JJ's is closer to my house and sure beats crap like Subway."}
{"text":"It's okay here. The customer service is okay and the dining area is clean. Turkey Tom has always been my favorite sub. Sometimes you need a break from Subway."}
{"text":"Okay, so this place is okay but nothing to really rave about! today, I had their #2, roastbeef with lettuce and tomato, minus the mayo.  Fast and friendly service, yes.... but two seconds after I paid the kid behind the counter..... I said, do you have more than one bread ( before I ordered, I told him I never was here before), he says OH YEAH, I forgot to ask you what bread you wanted and tell you about the three choices and your sandwich is already done! He actually said to me well, yours is done already but we have white, wheat and a wrap.  I wanted white anyway but what if I didnt? would they have re done it? apparently they type it in and IMMEDIATELY start it as soon as you order so after you pay the guy the thing is done, fast yes! but I wish I was told I had a bread choice.  Napkins? do they hide them?? LOL, me and another guy were looking, turns out it is BEHIND the counter where they hand you the sandwich, they did not give me any though with the order.  Chips/ Jimmy salted chips in the bag were good, kettle type potato chips.    I ordered a pickle, it was 1.25 extra but was fairly big and was a good pickle.  I think they need better value meals though because I paid over 9.00 for a pretty small sub, a small drink and a pickle and bag of chips.  I will go back but not on a regularly basis.  A bit overpriced but the food was good and fresh."}
{"text":"So, I haven't actually been here yet.  But my office is just down the street and they sent an employee by yesterday to say go #VGK and he walked around and gave everyone a free sandwich.  It was a small sandwich, but it was delivered and free!  The sandwich I had, ham and cheese, was delicious.  The representative that came was sharp.  He smiled, made eye contact, and represented his company well.  We will often purchase gift cards for our employees to pick up lunch near by and we will be buying Jimmy John's for everyone from here on out.  Thanks for the great surprise yesterday!"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is always delicious. These workers are some of the fastest I've  encountered and we're nice enough to make orders for 6 people even though they were closing in 3 minutes and were about to lock up when we arrived. They didn't have to serve us but they did and the sandwiches were very well made!"}
{"text":"This crew delivered! I needed a light dinner one evening and Jimmy Johns seemed like the right think. We walked in after the dinner rush, so there was no line. The establishment was super clean and everyone working was very friendly... and fast! I mean freaky fast! I ordered my sub, paid, and before I could take one step away from the cash register my sub was in my hand. So freaky fast.  I took it to go and in retrospect I should have eaten it there and gotten a second one to go. The bread was nice and fresh and the topping were crisp and delicious. It was spot on tasty! Thanks JJ for a great sub sandwich!"}
{"text":"first things first: if you don't eat the Jimmy sandwich at the time you order it, it's horrible.  it doesn't hold up well at all.  maybe it's the lettuce, i dont know, i don't care.  it's a bad sandwich after an hour.  So, forget catering, forget buying tomorrow's lunch today (as I did) and got -- yet again, -- one soggy sandwich.  ordered my roast beef sandwich for $6.01 with turkey added.  Cost me $1.50....for two little pieces of turkey.  Like$35/pound!!!!  But more importantly, I asked for my sandwich with peppers on the side.  \"can't do it', they said.  What?  \"Can't do it.  Policy\".    So, I thought, this can't be right and I emailed Jimmy, corporately.  Here's Heathers reply, so inane it bears repeating:  \"Thank you for taking the time to contact us.  I apologize for any confusion but it actually up to the Franchisee whether or not to offer peppers on the side.  Some locations offer it as an option while others don't.  It is not a corporate rule.  Again, I apologize for any inconvenince this has caused.  Hopefuly you understand and will still consider Jimmy John's in the future.\"  NOW WHY WOULD I DO THAT?  WHY WOULD I COME BACK? YOU JUST TOLD ME I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WNAT, WON'T GIVE MY WHAT I WANT -- AND THAT YOU THINK IM CONFUSED!  HELL NO! I'M NOT COMING BACK!  Well ya know what?  My policy is THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT.    I'M NEVER EATING THIS OVER-CONFIDENT, MEDIOCRE SANDWICH AGAIN.  EAT ME, Jimmy.  I got: Firehouse Subs, Subway, Jersey Mike's, Quizno's (still good), a bunch of mom-and-pops.  Eat me.  never ever ever again eat at Jimmy John's!"}
{"text":"This place is super fast....Conner was getting ready to make a delivery and saw that i was waiting in line while everyone else was busy and came over in a matter of seconds to take my order..good job guys"}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's Subs they're my favorite in the whole town with them you actually get me on your sandwich and not just a bunch of bread and the prices are pretty reasonable but I do have a complaint their delivery service is BS they claim to be the fastest sandwich shop in town which is easy to do when your only deliver four blocks from your shop I am 4 miles from them and they won't deliver to me they say I'm not within their delivery radius to drive to their shop literally takes me six and a half minutes all I'm saying Jimmy John's speed isn't everything you could try saying we might not be the fastest to get to you sir but we'd still be happy to come to you with that being said I'll still stop in"}
{"text":"Alright...This was my third time going back and I don't think I will be back again, as my ratings keep going down and down.   The hubs and I were near by and hungry. He had never been so I said we should stop by.   We get there, there is one other table of people eating, the place is empty and there are NINE employees working. It did not seem like there was a manager working as what transpired was out of control.   Two male employees are bickering back and forth, LOUDLY...like super loud, we could hear everything that was going on the whole time we were there. I was waiting for fists to fly at any second. You would think if there was a manager on duty, they would have split the two guys up or sent one home early. It was really very uncomfortable. The raised their voices to each other the WHOLE time we were there.   Next an employee walks in with burgers and fries and hot dogs from Five Guys next door. Employees are all hanging around a table eating and talking and really having a great time. I was floored. None seemed to be on a legitimate break as they would hang around the table, eat, go do some work, then come back and talk and eat. No employee looked to be over the age of 18.   We go to bite into our sandwiches and it seems that all the distractions really made for poor sandwich making. I ordered a Vegetarian, I open it up and its missing the sprouts. Hubs orders the Vito, and asks them to put mayo on it instead of the dressing.....they opt to put nothing on it. So we both had to take our sandwiches back up and ask them to fix them.   This was the hubs first time and he never wants to go back there. It was really just not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"17 minutes after we ordered online, our food was delivered. Wow!!! Now that is 'crazy fast delivery'. Our sandwich was so tasty. I'm impressed, and cannot wait to order again.  The bread was so flavorful, as was the meat and veggies. They did not even charge a delivery fee.  Choose your sandwich, add your tip...and have a nice day! Boo ya."}
{"text":"Ordered a  veggie sandwich ate 1/2 of it the  other 12 I ate after the fist 1/2 found a long black hair( I have red hair) called Kevin a smart ass worthless so called manager and he said well you ate 1/2 the sandwich I told the asshole I ate the one part 1st and then the other 1/2  and that's when I found the hair the asshole said well you ate 1/2 the sandwich, really what a dick I can't help if there was hair on the other 1/2.  He refused to give me a refund and of course I didn't want another sandwich, the girl who made the sandwich had a long black weave and she had no hair net on!! How gross is that.  I will never  eat there again and have advised my friends not to either also don't get drinks there they don't clean the mold out of the machine.  I called corprate and the assine owner  also named Kevin never called to follow up.  So unprofessional.  Also they had a pervert named Kevin working there he was on the news for molesting young girls they finally fired him after some customers complained but other then that Kevin was not going to fire him until corporate was notified, they say birds of a feather flock together so be careful young ladies.  I give them a rating of ZERO but you have to select a star to post so disregard the star they are ZEROS"}
{"text":"I've always loved Jimmy Johns and have ordered from multiple locations all over the valley for years; never once has my order been anything less than perfect. I am leaving feedback for my most current order because I feel the Gilbert & Baseline location deserves a shout out! Twice in one week my order to a new address was delivered ABOVE expectations, as per usual, but I was hesitant to order on Wednesday morning 10 mins after the store opened because I understand how that can be less than 'fun' in the food industry :)  Long story short, I was starving and my order arrived quicker than I ever thought imaginable, everything was just as I had asked via my online order, and the driver was very friendly! I always ask for extra, extra mayo and mustard and JJ's seems to be the only place that truly acknowledges my weird requests!  Thank you for the consistently delicious food and freakishly-fast delivery! #hugefan  Sincerely,  Shannon Edwards Shannon.Edwards@hotmail.com  Store#2131 (1515 N. Gilbert Road)"}
{"text":"After 30 minutes waiting for my food I called to ask about it and was informed that there was only one driver and she would be right there. 20 minutes later I got the driver on the phone and she told me she tried to deliver my food but I wasn't home. Wrong! I was in the driveway the whole time working a garage sale. She finally realized she went to the wrong address and got it to me.... An hour after it was ordered! I called and spoke with the manager, who was quite nice, and he gave me a refund as well as a $10 credit.   The next day I helped with the garage sale again so I decided to use my $10 credit, but this time I drove there myself. Before I placed the order I explained about the credit so they tried to locate me in the system to verify... They couldn't find my information so I had to call in my order while standing at the register so that they could locate my account. Then they couldn't get the system to credit me so they kept taking other orders while I stood back and waited for them to figure it out. 20 minutes later we finally got the food and was able to pay.   While we were waiting there was a man trying to order for his kid. All he wanted was a slim with mayo added. The manager told the guy that mayo could not be added to that sandwich even though the man offered to pay extra....   I'm baffled. How can you screw up that many times with one person and then piss another person off by not letting them have mayo in such a short period of time ? Do you really expect to stay in business with this sort of service?"}
{"text":"Adequate, consistent food.  Food: They have a fairly short menu with quite standard sandwiches. Nothing unusual, for the most part. Maybe one exception is the \"unwich\", which I usually get. They substitute lettuce leaves for the bread, much like In-n-Out's \"protein style\". Anyway, I got the #15 Club Tuna as an unwich. Everything was fresh and the tuna was quite flavorful.  Cost: Decent: today was $7 including tax for one sandwich, no drinks.  Service:  Staff is always friendly, and the food comes out quickly.  Atmosphere: Standard strip mall storefront, and for me, the music is always too loud.  Overall: When I'm in a hurry and want a low-carb sandwich, this is the place I go. Recommended."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times and every time I am always impressed by how freaky fast they actually are. But not tonight. Super slow. I pulled up to the window it took about seven minutes for someone to even come to the window to get my debit card. After that I received my sandwich in about another two minutes. It looks like they were shortstaffed tonight. They need to be consistent. If you are freaky fast you need to be freaky fast every day."}
{"text":"This is only the second time I have eaten at this place, it was OK. I always here how great this place is but my thoughts r this...... The bread was kinda hard. I was think fresh bread would mean softer bread. But the sandwich was OK, I'll go back for sure, maybe we will see.  The chips were my favorite so good. I called in my order ahead of time thinking that is would be busy at 11:30, nope not busy at all but r noon when we were getting ready to leave that is when the people started rolling in. Got my food ready and sat down to eat."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is a good sandwich shop but I'm gonna tell you the truth about them. They're fucking cheap as hell. Portions are small as a dogs weiner. Three slices of turkey, cheese, and vegetables that are so paper thin that you can almost see right through it. They even changed the lettuce from delicious leaf lettuce to cheap ass, rabbit food iceburg because it cost less yet they want $6 for a sandwich? Like give me a break. Seriously.....all bread and paper thin condiments. I feel as though I'm at Panda Express when they give you all rice and very minimal meat. Cheap cheap cheap! Go to Jersey Mikes instead. They cut the turkey fresh for you in front of you and they load it up really good. The taste is amazing as well. The only thing good about JJ is the bread. Big deal. When I go out to eat I want my monies worth. Not some cheap as owner that skimps on portions."}
{"text":"Love their subs. Cheap and top shelf ingredients."}
{"text":"Good sub place. Bread was good. Only con is it's out of the way of the Pitt campus (relative to everything else). It is worth the walk though. I would go back."}
{"text":"Ok. My sandwich was delicious. So if you want a good sandwich and you don't care if you are treated like shit, this is the place for you.   The people taking orders are just rude. As other people said, you can't change your sandwich at all. Seriously? I hope everyone likes their subs the same. My daughter got a slim. That they would NOT add mayo or tomato to. We had to get mayo packets and take tomatoes off my sub in order to make her sandwich how she wanted it.   Just stupid ordering practices and I WONT be back. Jersey Mike's is where it's at!!! They are very friendly and give you what you want on your sub!!!"}
{"text":"With a sandwich shop that proclaims to be \"freaky fast\", you wouldn't expect perfection. This location has proved me wrong. Their sandwiches are delicious everytime and not one single thing is wrong! They also have a drive thru, which is definitely a plus! Will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"I love me some Jimmy Johns. I'm a rather picky eater so I never get much on my subs. That's why I love Jimmy Johns so much because they have the 'slim' menu. My personal favorites are the slim 1 and the slim 5. Plus you have to try their barbecue chips. Whenever we order delivery they are there so crazy quick."}
{"text":"Yes they are fast but if you hire someone to throw your food together that is what you get. Alot of nothing to the sandwich. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place over the weekend and had a great experience. I did not catch her name but a young African American girl served me and she was beyond helpful. Ordered two sandwiches both with special requests and she got everything perfect. This will be our go to place in the NW."}
{"text":"Freaky Fast!  So far they have lived up to this promise.  Food is always fresh.  Not thrilled that soda comes in cups.  Kinda gross when your food is carried on a bike on a hot day."}
{"text":"The service is good, which is why it deserves 2 stars, but as far as food and subs go, you're going to want to go somewhere else. I've been here twice and both subs were abysmal. I can't remember exactly what it was but it was a thin with roast beef. Basically $4 for some dense chewy bread with 1 slice of meat. It would have been $5 with 1 slice of cheese. The second time i ordered a different sub but it was still small and tasteless. Besides service, the only other nice thing about here is that their ingredients are always fresh and they bake their own bread ( I mean the bread sucks but at least it's baked in store)."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in the university area. Great service over the phone and fast delivery drivers. It is very rare that I wait more than 15 minutes for my order. Tastes great and very affordable"}
{"text":"Place is tiny and awkwardly set up. You have to reach over someones head to get a lid and straw for your drink... Went there twice and they got my really simple (turkey, lettuce, and mustard on wheat) order wrong both times. The last time they smothered it in mayo! If you want an amazing sandwich skip this place and go to sprouts deli... 2.99 and delicious."}
{"text":"Just ordered a turkey Tom number for asked for extra avocado an extra me when they gave me the sandwich I search through the tire sandwich for avocado. Took it to the counter told him I couldn't find it they said it was in between the cheese. Probably saw about maybe 1/6 of an inch of avocado spread on a small small portion. When I asked if he was going to put adequate amount on there he looked at me like I was a retard.  Horrible. Two thumbs down. Not even the slightest effort to explain the situation properly or even give me adequate portion."}
{"text":"This place has great bread. Really fresh and chewy. The food is served fast and the price seems to be pretty good as well. The only 2 things that keep it from a 5 star is that the subs seem to lack originality, and they don't deliver late-night at this location. It reminds me a bit of Silvermine Subs and is maybe even a little better as far as taste.  The lettuce wrap subs are very original to this place. Although I would never eat one, my girlfriend was a fan."}
{"text":"Good Sammies, super fast. I love JJ's. The best one is Gilbert and Germann, just because the people that work there are always friendly. Here they just do their job but that's fine too. Not a lot of seating at this one but JJs is consistent, good and I don't think I've ever waited more than 2 minutes for a sandwich.all sandwiches are cold so if you need toasted go elsewhere but it way better than the other chains."}
{"text":"Very rude driver. It was late. He pulled up blaring music. Made a rude comment. Maybe he should be more professional or get out of customer service."}
{"text":"Another average sub shop. The only thing that stood out was their fantastic bread. Other then that Jimmy Johns was just average. If not for the bread I would rate it along the same lines as Subway,maybe a half star higher.  Still the best chain sub shop in town is Firehouse."}
{"text":"Pretty much know what to expect and what you're getting with a Jimmy Johns even though they are franchises. They're typically all the same. They're fast. Sometimes they forget the peppers. Unfortunately I'm 1/4 mile outside their delivery range."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is a great example of a simple idea executed really well.  I love the 7 grain bread and the jalapeno kettle chips, and they always make good on their promise to deliver freaky fast!"}
{"text":"don't order online from this location. want mustard? extra vinaigrette? extra peppers? extra anything that doesn't come with a basic sandwich?! forget about it. delivery is fast but the food is shitty because of the blatant disregard for individual orders. they deliver what they want, not what you want, 90% of the time."}
{"text":"They only had one on Bell and I kept bugging the Manger to come out here since he used to work at Sports Chalet in the area. So glad they did. Two sub places I like here and another place I wont mention, it's not the way! Number 9 eazy hots ,12 with bacon, and when I really need a bacon fix its a JBLT with extra B! So Good!"}
{"text":"Ordered a sandwich a couple weeks ago. It was good. The bread is quite fresh and they provide you with a pretty nice size sandwich. The tomatoes were real jucy and a bit spicy. Made the sandwich better.  The customer service wasn't bad. She is very helpful and took my order accurately. Thanks! Will order again!"}
{"text":"Yesterday evening my counterpart and a few other members of our staff ordered Jimmy Johns. It's been a while since I have had it. I will say the sandwich was quite good. The tuna sandwich with its toppings were quite delicious. Thank you for the fresh food and fast delivery! Thanks for the great customer service, volunteers from the Phoenix LGBT center!"}
{"text":"We would appreciate the freaky fast service way more if our order was correct. Right on the ticket - made incorrectly.  Music was on point the day we visited, but the worker singing from the back wasn't awesome."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for soft fresh bread and Jimmy John's does it perfectly. This was my first first to this location and it was packed. But our order came up quickly and perfectly. The right amount of mayo for me and no mayo for my boyfriend.  (You'd be surprised how many people can mess that up.)  The place was clean.  (Including the bathroom)  I'll def be back next tiem Im in the area."}
{"text":"This place is not helpful at all!! I was ordering a sub with just ham, mayo, and pickle on it (for a 6 year old), and I was told that wasn't possible. I then asked one more time just a ham sub with mayo and pickle. I was then told I can have a plain ham sandwich with mayo packets on the side. I had asked for pickles on it, ONCE again I was told that they can't so that... But they can give me a whole pickle.. BUT they can't cut it up. I would really love someone to example to me why they couldn't do that?! And on top of that all I got was attitude from the cashier. Great customer service, NOT! Place is a joke, hire new people. I'll be going to Jersey Mike's for now on. At least they are willing to do the little things!"}
{"text":"Great service and soft bread - yumm but get double meat if you want more - quick service with a smile"}
{"text":"We've been ordering from this Jimmy Johns pretty consistently. Always quick, delicious and easy! They even have an online system that actually works, unlike some of their competitors (you know who you are, Firehouse Subs)"}
{"text":"Huge sandwiches for under $5, a steal on the east side of Mesa!   I had the #1 Pepe (gourmet style ham + cheese), without Mayo.  I LOVE provolone, so it was right up my alley.  Chips and a drink extra as a combo for I think under $9).    Extremely fast service, they made our meals directly to order; took literally around 2 minutes.  We came early, a little before 11am so there was no busy rush.    It's good for what it is; just be aware nothing is toasted or hot; they only serve cold sandwhiches.  I'd give it a 3.5 if I could, but I'll round up for fast service."}
{"text":"Finally, freaky fast subs comes to Elyria. Great bread is the key. These fresh subs are perfect for quick lunches. The day old bread deal is a fun treat for picnics and school lunches as well."}
{"text":"I'm not normally compelled to write reviews of fast casual chains, but Jimmy John's has come through for me many times.  To begin, Solon has a lack of options for fast casual as it is. Everyone flocks to Chipotle, yet the line is often out the door and around the corner... and alas, Jimmy John's is literally across the street. There's never a wait. Sometimes I just cannot handle going into the surrounding establishments with insane lines. And there, across the street, is Jimmy John's, waiting for me. They make your sandwich incredibly fast. Sure, my order has been wrong here a few times, but usually, its correct.   This location makes the quality, consistent sandwiches one comes to expect from a Jimmy John's. Its super reliable. Literally, from the time you walk in, until the time you leave with your orders, is maybe under 5 minutes. They don't deliver, but then again, they are a smaller establishment (only a few tables in the shop). Also, I really love that you can substitute the bread on the sandwiches with a salad wrap (the \"unwhich\").  Alright, Jimmy John's, you fly under the radar but continue to suck me in, especially when my anxiety about lines kicks in."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is SOOOO GOOOOD! their service is very good too. the price is just right! I love coming here at my lunch time"}
{"text":"We live 1.5 miles from this location. We thought, hey! let's get it delivered!  Ha. Yeah right. They won't deliver to us... literally... it's less than 5 mins away!!!  WE are outside of their range. Ridiculous.  So we sent someone to go pick up. OK sure. Sandwiches were extremely bland...only white bread, no flavor, and they didn't put sprouts on any of the sandwiches we ordered. Can't fill a simple order.  Best part was the chips.  Will not order from them again, neither dine -in or delivery... cause yeah... they wont come to us, awesome... not.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"First time I had a sandwhich here. Got a Vito because I love italian sandwiches. My husband raved about the country club and said it was better than subway. He brought home my sandwich. He order extra avacado spread. I opened my sandwich and it was completely dry. I don't even the think the avacado was there. Didn't see the vinegarette either. Grossest sandwhich next to blimpies. I'd go to subway any day over this. Bread seemed bought not fresh too. And cookie in a bag. I guess I shouldn't compare it to subway but they even have fresh cookies. I'm just not impressed and won't buy from a jimmy johns."}
{"text":"These aren't crazy-ass great sandwiches like you'd get at DiBella's or a few choice local delis, but this is the creme de la creme of franchise sub joints. Plus, their delivery fee is freaking 35 cents. You can order online, pay by debit card, and have a big-ass club sandwich on tasty French bread within 20 minutes. Perfect for agoraphobic sloths like myself."}
{"text":"To me, this is just another sandwich joint. They just make them pretty fast. There's nothing that really wows me here. I had a coupon for a free sub which is why I stopped in. This is a great place if you're on your lunch and need a fast, decent  cheap meal. I got their number 1 and it was pretty good. Can't go wrong with ham and cheese!"}
{"text":"Gourmet, I think NOT!  More like production built tasteless subs with music so loud my wife had to turn her hearing aides off. You can't even get regular chips, everything is branded and did I mention that the music is really REALLY loud! No I would not recommend this to anyone that does have ear buds playing their own loud music and wanting a tasteless sandwich."}
{"text":"Freaky slow. My office literally 0.4 miles from this place and it takes 1.5 hours for them to deliver"}
{"text":"Honestly the worst Jimmy John's delivery I have ever dealt with. I live 5 minutes away and have yet to receive my sandwich, an hour and forty-five minutes later."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, and delicious! I've ordered for delivery and gone to this location and they are consistently good!"}
{"text":"Great Subs with friendly staff. They are super fast and the food is fresh. The bread is baked fresh daily."}
{"text":"This location has major problems and is not worthy of using the Jimmy John's name.  Bread is always soo dry and tastes days old, Turkey is slimy, service is slow and the workers never have any interest in being anything remotely close to polite.  I've been to dozens of Jimmy John's all over the place and never encountered an issue before.    I am a huge fan of Jimmy John's but obviously this location has a major management/owner issue."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, good is heavily biased towards the first two. It's less varied than Subway. Weird? Aren't there 18 or so main sandwiches? Certainly are but there's 3-4 base  meats and then it's just a matter of arrangement.   Maybe using  gourmet in the name  is what's bugging me as it's pretty pedestrian and the love for the bread from most reviews doesn't fit  my experience and other than providing a structure to place the meat on. That and the wall propaganda , pretty bombastic considering the mediocre bread  and  almost tasteless beef sandwich I had at lunch which was about as processed as beef gets while retaining it's form.   3 stars because it's  good value for money if you have to go with people / are in a five minute rush ( at that point you have more issues than can be dealt with by bread and filling)"}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns subs and if you haven't had one you should go but know that this one is the least \"freaky fast\" of any Jimmys I've been too (coast to coast).  They don't do the subtle things that helps their speed and I am not sure why but it's pretty isolated to this location."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, delicious and affordable. Can't get much better than that! I love the veggie sub and jalapeño chips. If you haven't tried their delicious food, do it already!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. As an elementary school secretary, when I was called by this location's management and offered lunch for our hardworking teachers and staff, I gladly accepted. Nice, right? Our teachers only have a limited time for lunch, and take it when their grade levels go to lunch, so timeliness was important. Ten minutes after they said they'd be here, I called to make sure they were on the way. The manager answered and said, \"Oh, I meant to call you. We got a $300 catering order, so we won't be able to bring you lunch today.  How about Monday?\"  I explained that we didn't have school Monday, but Tuesday would work well. Now, many teachers didn't bring their lunches that day, and the ones who already had their grade levels in the cafeteria didn't have any time to run out and get something, so they ate what they could from the vending machine. Tuesday rolls around, and the same thing happens! I called to make sure they were on the way, and the person that answered the phone didn't know anything about it! She said her manager never told her about it! Okay, mistake once, maybe. Mistake twice, pretty bad, but then the manager never even called back to apologize. These are teachers, educating your children, underpaid as it is, and this is the second time! I called corporate, and they said someone would get back to me. Not until two days later, when we had multiple people calling in threatening to take it to the media, did the manager of this store call and say he was sorry. Good customer service would've been calling back the day of the second mishap asking what he could do to make it right.  Nope. Someone from corporate basically told him his job was at stake, and he better do something. So, two people from corporate brought us lunch (6 days after the first mishap) from this location.  THIS IS HOW NOT TO RUN A BUSINESS."}
{"text":"This was a little better than Subway for me. I've never been here before and was expecting something more like Jersey Mike's but it wasn't. I ordered #7 (vito) and it was capicola, salami, provolone, onions, tomatoes and italian vinagrette. They had different kinds of bread (which I was unaware of). I had french roll. Love the ambiance and the different sayings all over the wall. They were out of ice in their soda machine and once we got our sandwiches, they were very slim on their meat. Like Subway!!! I probably won't be back here since I found out they have a Jersey Mike's in the area!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Totally Tuna sub and the Vito sub for delivery. The sandwiches were delicious and they were delivered super fast! We will definitely be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"I frequently order from this particular Jimmy Johns because it is about 6 minutes away from my house--literally. When in a hurry and not able to drive there myself, I'll call in for delivery. Unfortunately over 80% of the time, it takes over 45 minutes to get to my door (one time in particular I timed them and it took 55 mins.). The first few times, I thought maybe they were understaffed, but I'm not entirely sure anymore. I probably won't be ordering from this location anymore unless I have the time to drive there and pick it up."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of JJ in the first place. To me the food is bland at best. Pretty pricey too. But I was at the hospital nearby and needed to force some food down. The thing that annoyed me about this place is they clearly give priority to the delivery. This part of down town has thousands of businesses and these guys deliver. But when I walk in my sandwich just gets in line. So if you get unlucky and a lawyer ordered 50 turkey and 50 ham you are kind of screwed.  This place also seems to be run by no one old enough to drink. I get these jobs are good for kids. But should there not be one adult in the bunch in case the place burns down or whatever?"}
{"text":"I'm sorry guys! Or maybe I'm not. I'm giving 5 stars cause everything else was closed! I was ticked. Luckily they're in a small center with all the other closed places. So, what did I do? I walked towards the light and bam! Submarine sandwiches it is. I got the #3 Totally Tom. Got her the #4 Turkey Tom. Haven't eaten them yet but I'll update the review as I do with my others. I'll be back just cause they were here when I needed them. Oh, and they have Cherry Coke which is always a plus (or star) in my book. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I would have given five stars but sometimes I get gross pickles - they are super light colored and they taste weird.   That said, I get otherwise great food from here pretty quickly.  I had to write a review tonight because of my delivery girl... She was so so so sweet and then we had a soda mishap where it dropped... She went all the way back to get me another one! Which may be normal service but she was just super nice in general. All of the folks I've had deliver have been really good people, too!"}
{"text":"I order from here all the time! I always request mustard packets with my sandwich and they only bring them about half the time"}
{"text":"This place Is horrible.   I tried to order a \"roast beef\" slim with mayo.  I was told the slims do not get any \"freebies\" such as mayo. I could get mayo packets but......... they would not put any \"freebies\" on my sandwich.   Really we are talking a knife full of mayo. Cheap cheap cheap.   Eat Fresh. GO SUBWAY. You rule supreme.   No mayo, REALLY!"}
{"text":"Im not a big sub guy.  Throw some crap between 2 slices of bread is kinda boring to me.  No matter how hammered I am.  Picked up a sub here for my Dad and he really liked it.  People working were all fun and fast.  I can't get over how well priced this place is.  Its like half the price of the Millenial, hipster sub shop in Ohio City."}
{"text":"So I have never actually been to this location but I am close enough to have my food delivered. I usually eat the same thing so I just go into my account online (do not judge me) and just re order the same meal. The food is always fresh and the delivery time is super fast!"}
{"text":"I live less then 3 miles away from this location but they won't deliver to me. What kind of place that advertises how amazing your delivery services doesn't go 3 miles away from there location. Certainly not a Jimmy John's fan anymore!!"}
{"text":"Always amazing! I wish I was in the delivery radius and ide order every weekend!  But it's a cool spot to sit n eat there really convenient  too and lots to read in the walls! Funny $#!+"}
{"text":"Club Lulu fantastic as always!  Delivery still impresses me every time!  The order has never been wrong and I probably ordered a dozen times from this location!! Great job JJ keep up the good work! And I love eating in too because there is so much to read and is very funny and cute then I get a 2nd sub to go.  Yes I eat them both the same day!"}
{"text":"A lot has changed. It was very nice. Clean. Not too loud. Yes I bagged my own sub but that's because they don't ask you here or to go so if you are going to go, just grab a bag! Not having napkins out keep it less cluttered as well. The people were friendly."}
{"text":"I frequent this Jimmy John's quite often since it's near my work. Plus, like any other JJ location, they are fast. We have also used this location to cater our work lunches. They deliver for free so just remember to tip. The ingredients in my sandwich are always fresh and I never feel like I'm getting left overs, even when I visit later at night. The employees have always been friendly and even say goodbye to you as you are walking out. Only reason I had to dock a star is because sometimes the store smells kinda funky and its in a sketchy plaza. So just be careful while walking from and to your car. I'll def be back!"}
{"text":"Have you heard that Jimmy John's is fast? Well, believe it. They are really fast?   This location is located on the Hobby Lobby plaza next to AT&T. The shop is small with a few tables, but very clean. The cashier was friendly and was patient with me. The one thing I love about Jimmy John's in general is their bread. I usually hate getting white bread for my sandwiches, but their bread is so soft. The turkey is flavorful and moist. They aren't skimpy on the rest of the sandwich ingredients either.   Here's to show how fast they are. I paid for my meal and I went to fill up my drink cup. By the time I put the lid on my drink, my sandwich was already waiting for me. That's pretty fast.   I don't live near the area, but I'll be back if I ever am."}
{"text":"I like Jimmy Johns I have probably spent a few thousand dollars at their shops over the years. Recently I moved to Scottsdale and this Jimmy Johns has some very disrespectful employees in it. They sometimes don't even say hello or your welcome even if you say thank you. You just get troll stares as you take your food and leave before they say something rude to you. Avoid avoid if you can."}
{"text":"It'd be great if this JJs could instruct how their delivery drivers should drive. In other words, it is not kosher to drive in the clearly marked bus lane/turn lane between Whitney Way and JJs. Just skip them and get Milios or Erbs."}
{"text":"We live right around the corner from them. Always great customer service. They always get my oder right.  I get my order under 10 minutes every time I get delivery (even at other locations). I like the multi-grain bread it's the best. Most of the time I get a unwhich(lettuce wrap). It's sooo good!"}
{"text":"Seems to be always overwhelmed with orders and workers scrambling frantically.  My sub always comes out good so that's what keeps me coming back. You would think making a sub with everything infront of you would be \"freaky fast\" but not at all."}
{"text":"Super fast service with a great friendly staff. We usually order online and pick it up here, and they blow chipotle out of the water in online order timing and accuracy. They have plenty of options and their food is always fresh. I have never sat in, but this is a good option for the Goodyear crowd that needs a fast meal."}
{"text":"Great service, great food! Always fast and friendly. Jimmy Johns is always consistent. The sandwiches are always delicious and their service is consistent."}
{"text":"Seems like every time I call in a order to pickup on my way home from a long day at work and don't want to cook for the hubby ....I Don't have time to check it. Cuz I got to get to my second job.  The order is so wrong. Or we got 9 slices of pepperoni on the peperoni pizza. I had to go to store for pepperoni for the topping.. Not happy!"}
{"text":"Kind of got over in n out after going there like 900 times in 2 months so decided do give Jimmy Johns a try . Last time I went a couple years ago it was meh but I figured I'd try it again and wow. Got the hunters club with no mayo no tomatoes and I'm always worried that fast food places will get the orders wrong when I order specific like that but I was pleased when I got what I asked for . Talked with gabi for a few and she seemed nice staff... all seemed to be having a good time . All in all food was good,staff were nice, and the place was clean not really sure what else you can hope for ."}
{"text":"Don't go to Subway! Vito, pepe and tuna subs And the bread is good!*  *and I don't even like bread"}
{"text":"Tasty bread and quick service.  Good place for a quick lunch. I like their veggie sub, its quite tasty. My husband has liked everything he has ordered, but complains there is not enough meat.  You can buy their day old bread for 50 cents a loaf. Awesome deal."}
{"text":"New employees not making a simple sandwich correctly..and poor management or a situation,if you can call it managemet,he even hung up on me when I called him out on using new employees as an excuse. Way too overpriced for the horrible service you get from here,I wander if their corporate office realizes how watered down their appeal is getting."}
{"text":"Just ordered a large order 9 sandwiches online and when the guy came to the door with only 2 bags I said wow you actually got 67$ worth of sandwiches in 2 bags? He bragged about how hard it was and of course it was missing a sandwhich. When I called all I got was. I can take it off your order or refund you. Or make it and deliver it to you. Nothing for the inconvenience I ask..nope. wow. Spend 80$ on fast food and get inconvenienced. Such poor customer service. I usually don't type these so long but,I thought I may as well since I'm just sitting here waiting for the sandwich that should have been delivered the first time. What else should I be doing...that's right I should be enjoying the party that we are having while we all wait for the sandwich that should have already been delivered. Thanks for nothing Jimmy Johns! Not that you care because you are too hipster cool for that. But that was the last time I or anyone at my party will be partaking in your fine establishment."}
{"text":"Well generally food is good.  Service is about the same here, not particularly special but they get you out the door without much hassle.  This occasion was not the norm, other than the music so loud you can't communicate without repeating everything or just deciding \"whatever\".  Well this evening the little, skinny dude behind the counter didn't like me asking why I couldn't get an extra item on the side so I could determine how much I wanted to put on my sandwich so he offers the sarcastic \"Have a good night\" comment.  Had to let him know I was having a good night and that his personality really glistened, like the stuff on a pooper scooper."}
{"text":"I am not sure what all the craze is about Jimmy John's, but this place really popped up out of nowhere in Arizona. One day, there were like 5 of them in the valley and everyone was in love.. I would have to say that I am not really that impressed. The subs are just like any other sub, IMHO. Personally, I like Quiznos better."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today.  My tuna sandwich was like soup.  The bread was soupy and wet.  Full of water, like they did not drain the tuna fish.  Yuck.  Does this store have any QC or manager?  The roast beef sandwich my buddy ordered looked like it was just one slice.  I don't know how they stay in business.     I will give them another try next week to see if it is any better.  If not there are other subs shops close by."}
{"text":"It's Jimmy Johns. The food is always the same. Hard to hate. Easy to love. But the people in this particular establishment were so nice and efficient and friendly. Made my whole day."}
{"text":"5 star all the way!!  Manager and I agreed that we didn't like the patriots!  Everyone in there was super friendly!  Oh and the sub was perfect!"}
{"text":"Ahhh I love this place, but the service has been bad lately...one time I ordered a sandwich and it got delivered with no meat or mayo or mustard.... and the other time they couldn't find my house, in which after an hour I cancelled my order. Sucks because I really liked this place :("}
{"text":"This is the best JIMMY JOHNS i have been to excellent service great atmosphere... very clean...deliciouse GOURMET SANDWICHES..of all the JIMMY JOHNS around i travel to this ONE BECAUSE of the enthusiastic employees... WAY to go JIMMY JHONS"}
{"text":"Waited an hour for one sandwich that would never be delivered.   Called them and asked about my order only to be told \"we don't have a delivery driver tonight\". Then her excuse for not telling me earlier was that she \"tried but my number didn't work\". Checked the order. My number is correct, and works fine. So basically I got charged for nothing.   Never again."}
{"text":"I live in Laveen, and let me tell you the food options leave a lot to be desired. I am not going to review the actual food. Its Jimmy Johns. Its exactly the same everywhere. What I am going to address is the accuracy of orders, and the customer service.   When the store first opened, I was pretty unhappy with the stores customer service. They refused to deliver to my house, but would deliver to my NEXT DOOR neighbor. Eventually we talked to the manager and he said we could call and they would deliver. After that, we started ordering delivery a few times a week. We have never had issues with order's being incorrect, and I am a vegetarian that requests quite a few changes to my sub. Today I went to place an order, and Sarah told me that they only had one driver and it would take 40 minutes for my food to arrive. I told her this was fine, and thanked her for warning me. Sarah called me back, and let me know that they were going to give me the order for free because of the wait (even though I was fine with the wait) and even gave me a free drink! She promised that my food would arrive in the next 20 minutes, and my food arrived 10 minutes later.   Hands down the best customer service I have ever received in Laveen."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's but I simply despise this location. Service is always horrendous, delivery can take up to an hour (which is deplorable for a company that advertises \"freaky fast delivery\"). They are unable to follow simple instructions on how my sandwich should be prepared, every single time without fail they forget to do something as simple as no tomatoes, cut the sandwich in half or take mayo packets. But today was the icing on the cake, since delivery can always take up to an hour I got sick and tired of giving them a tip if it was late, so lo and behold the last two days I have ordered a sandwich the delivery guy REFUSED to leave my office until I came down and gave him a tip. When our receptionist told him that she could sign for it he informed her he was waiting until I gave him a tip and that he was an hourly employee and could wait around all day. Just wow."}
{"text":"I had never heard about Jimmy John's before coming to Arizona, but now I'm seriously wondering why.   For lack of a better explanation, there's something magical about Jimmy John's. The concoctions they come up with are so painfully simple you'll slap yourself in the head and wonder why you can't make it at home. Roast beef, lettuce, provolone and mayo on their french bread. Period.   I've been three times and each time I've literally sat and marveled at the sandwiches. That being said, JJ's is not something I'd pass up."}
{"text":"Went for the $1 customer appreciation deal! Service was very fast! I got the Vito and the turkey. Good sandwiches!"}
{"text":"We wanted to grab a quick lunch to have a picnic by the pool. Went online and placed our order for 6 different sandwiches, and they all were perfectly made. When I arrived, they were ready to go, and were very fresh. Employees were friendly... Good sandwiches for sure!"}
{"text":"I only get delivery from this Jimmy John's. This place is as good as it gets from consistency, to delivery, and the politeness of the delivery drivers.  I have an overly aggressive dog, and they are more than accommodating every time doing extra precautions for them selves, and for my convenience   Great Job to you guys at Jimmy John's especially the delivery drivers- its a tough job!"}
{"text":"Call me old but dam they play such loud music!! Even with my earphones full blast trying to enjoy my sandwich there music is pounding!!! Be considerate kids theirs older people and families trying to carry a conversation"}
{"text":"Really rude cashier.  Walked in and got stared at, employees only talking to each other and ignoring us- the customers."}
{"text":"For months now, all I've heard is how everyone really likes Jimmy John's. My friend and I were coming from Barrow Neurological for physical therapy around 1:00 PM. I turned off of Shea to 90th Street and headed to Flower Child. The line was out the door and neither one of us like standing that long, so we decided to finally try Jimmy John's next door. My friend ordered a turkey sub. I thought I'd have the BLT and asked for the bacon to be well done and crispy. The kid had another employee hold up a piece of bacon and said it came frozen?!? I asked if they could cook it well done and make it crispy in a microwave. He told me they didn't have microwaves and he couldn't cook it any longer to make it crispy!?! Told him I wasn't eating raw, frozen bacon! I ordered the vegetarian sandwich with avocado spread and mayonnaise. Looked it up on the Weight Watchers app and it was \"16\" out of my daily \"30\" points!!! My friend and I wanted to cut our subs in half, so I went to the counter to ask for a plastic knife. They don't have any?!? If you take your sub to them, they'll cut it in half for you. I got ice tea to drink, so asked at register for some Splenda because I didn't see any!!! I was told that they don't serve any!!! WHAT??? I have never been refused a sweetener for iced tea at any restaurant in my entire life!!! That was plain stupid!!! My friend and I have no desire to EVER go back to JIMMY JOHN'S!!!  There is no customer service there whatsoever!!! Like Splenda's going to break them?!? Not impressed at all with this chain!!! They should all go out of business!!!"}
{"text":"This Jimmy Johns has very fast lunch delivery and no delivery fee besides the tip.  They did mix up my order once but they came back out with a corrected delivery.  In general, Jimmy Johns should offer hot sandwiches."}
{"text":"Freaky Fast? More like F king Horrible.  I ordered delivery from this JJ a few weeks ago: it took over 40 min to receive my order, I had to call twice, and the only thing the \"manager\" on shift had to say was, \"I can cancel your order, or you can just wait for your food.\" I was pissed, didnt order for weeks, but tonight I needed dinner, didnt want to leave the house, and cant eat a whole pizza by myself, so I made the mistake of giving these guys another shot. This time, it took nearly 30min for my order to get here. I called the store and spoke to the same rude and unhelpful \"manager\" Joclyn. Her attitude and unsympathetic replies clearly show that delivery is a common issue with them. When I asked why more hasnt been done to fix this issue, which clearly isnt a one time problem, she restorted \"I cant do anything if a driver doesnt show up, feel me?\"  --- For real? What a pathetic cop-out. As a manager, there are MANY things you can do to ensure your store an uphold your brands claim to fame. 20min, 30min, 40min, is NOT freaky fast. Its slow and sloth-like. Im surprised this place is still in business. They are giving the Jimmy Johns brand a TERRIBLE reputation.  Mesa, Az, Baseline & Country Club"}
{"text":"The best thing about this JJ was the cashier. The lettuce was wilted. I paid seventy-five cent extra for cheese and if you see cheese I saw cheese. But this is what really bother me I asked the cashier to have them cut my sandwich in 4, I said it twice, and when they gave me my sandwich I asked again and when I got home it wasn't cut. But don't think I won't be calling them."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is a chain store sandwich shop.  We've eaten at a few all along the east and west coast.  Prices are adequate for the selections.  Although this little store was crowded during lunch time, service was quick!  Will be returning here alot since it's very close to work."}
{"text":"Not really my favorite sub shop. It's extremely plain. I mean, there's like literally no flavor. Not sure why everyone thinks this place is so great.   At least they're quick. Your food is ready by the time you're done ordering. Oh and good luck getting delivery. I hope you live next door, because that's as far as they deliver! Seriously, I live 1.5 miles away, and they don't deliver."}
{"text":"True to their slogan, they are indeed freaky fast. (Freaky delicious, too)  I seldom order at the actual store because my workplace tends to get party platters from them for the breakroom. But, I was showing a visiting relative around East Liberty recently and decided to show his taste buds the cacophony of delicious sandwiches Jimmy John's has to offer, so I nudged him into the shop.   We ended up getting the Totally Tuna and the Vegetarian. I kid you not, three minutes into my conversation with said relative after ordering, our subs were done! This has possibly been the fastest service I have ever received. I left with my mouth still hanging in shock at the frightening speed that the team members worked.  Now let's get talking about taste and quality of the actual subs.The bread crust is thin and gives in at the slightest bite, wherein which your teeth will sink into cottony soft goodness. You can always count on the veggies to be fresh and the meats full of flavor. They aren't stingy with the fillings either, each sub is literally jam-packed with meat and/or veggies, resulting in a very hearty meal for any occasion.   If you're craving for a fresh and filling sub or sandwich at an affordable price and freaky fast service, then definitely give Jimmy John's a try!"}
{"text":"If you want to support a restaurant owned by a vile, vicious killer of exotic animals. This is your place.  Think I'm exaggerating?  Google it."}
{"text":"No thanks. Went in with family. I got the veggie. It was caked with mayo (like it was put on with a caulking gun). When I went back up to ask for a plastic knife to cut up a portion of my sandwich to share with my 1 year old I was ignored while the staff person talked on the phone in plain sight of me standing there like an idiot for like 3 minutes waiting to be acknowledged. When I finally was I was told they didn't have any such knives . . .hmmmm . . . for a place that advertises catering out the ying yang per the propaganda posted all over I find this hard to believe. To add insult to injury it's overpriced. Go to Jersey Mikes instead. Cost about the same but taste better and service is better."}
{"text":"horrible customer service, it took over 45 minutes to receive our delivery order, once we received it, the sub order was wrong. I filled out the survey and was told a member of the surprise management team would be contacting me, its been over a week with no communication, obviously the management doesn't care about its customer service"}
{"text":"I love the new GM at this location.  She has been there for three months and has turned the store around.  The employees are much happier and the store is super clean.  I know this location had some issues in the past, but I think the nay-sayers should give it a try again.  I will bet my last dollar that your experience will be much better."}
{"text":"Service was 4 stars. I ordered a foot long tuna sandwich because I was hungry! Let's just say the tuna mix was so salty I couldn't finish the sandwich. I'll give this place another shot with a different sandwich since the customer service was pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's has the best bread for a quick sub. That's all there is to it.  Are there better sandwich shops? Sure there are but nothing a quick and convenient with what I'll call above Subway quality subs.  In fact, for a franchised sub shop, this is probably my favorite.  It's all about that bread which you can get a day old loaf of for  .50 (fiddy) cent!  I don't know what it is about it but I love it!  Now I normally grab an Italian Night Club but tonight I decided to try a Country Club.  You know I added the hot peppers by request too.  This was a solid choice and I'd get it again but it is not replacing that #9 as my favorite. One thing I really missed was the Italian dressing.  That would have been a nice addition.  And don't forget the pickle!  It's totally worth it if you are a dill pickle fan.  The location is nice on Grant St. and easy to get to from most places downtown.  As for service, I can't say much because they were so freaking fast! No joke there guys!  It took me longer to debate what to get rather than them making it and me being out the door.  I don't even think the crosswalk light changed!  I guess they are living up to the name.  You won't go wrong stoping in here!"}
{"text":"Screw this jimmy johns you can't deliver and I am 2 miles away from you guys? Never eating there garbage service dude on the phone acted and treated me like I was a second class citizen you're a high school kid calm down"}
{"text":"The best quick fix for a sandwich.  When we go to Jimmy John's we are always greeted with quick, friendly service and a professional staff.  As a regular customer the $ 3.95 little sandwich, note \" meat & bread only\" us a quick fix  After a long day.  After a  practice, I treated the cheerleaders Mom and a group of 10 to these little slamming sandwiches...she and the kids were ecstatic!!!."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches made quickly. The first time I tried them I wasn't impressed but I've since tried some of the other sandwiches on the menu and now they're one of my favorites for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Finally a Summerlin location! Wish it was bigger inside but the food is great, nice and fresh! Owner Mark is friendly and makes sure things are done right! Love my # 9 Italian sub! Jimmy Johns by far is my fav out here! The French bread is always fresh and tasty! Good value too!!"}
{"text":"I've never walked in to this location.... but this is the place I call from my couch when I'm hungry and exhausted. It doesn't happen too often, but they save the day when it does. The big John is my favorite, husband likes the Vito-although it was heavy on the onions and a tad smaller than my sandwich. Whoever answers the phone is always kind and efficient. Delivery never takes long. I like that they offer their sandwiches in lettuce wraps, but their bread is tasty, too."}
{"text":"What a surprise to leave the country for four months with no Jimmy Johns nearby and come back to find several within delivery distance. After leaving the midwest I've occasionally crave Jimmy Johns. It's pretty much the only sandwich shop I enjoy and hell, they will deliver one sandwich. You really cannot do much better. And yes, you can even include sprouts on your sandwich. Yum.  I swung by on my way into an afternoon meeting once and was not disappointed in their service, which is on par with my expectations. By the time I ordered my modified sandwich (replacing tomatoes with sprouts) and was given my change, my sandwich was ready and handed to me. Talk about service. You really can't beat it.   Pretty good experience aside from the hipster college kid at the counter that commented on how much pink I was wearing and when I replied thank you he looked very confused. He'll need to get used to the pink...  I haven't tried this locale's delivery yet, which is the true measurement. Hoping to taste great things from this place whenever I get the JJ craving!"}
{"text":"Everything tastes fake. The tuna is nasty and the other meats are slimy. Their lettuce is dry and the restaurant stinks really bad like BO and mayonnaise. I won't be back. Take your $$ elsewhere!! Fast is not always the best!"}
{"text":"Rude staff!  Was actually yell'd at for not knowing what the number 9 sandwich was on the menu!  I ordered  the Italian with hot peppers! Not a number 9!  Also was charged .25 for a water cup!  I will not return to this location"}
{"text":"a zero NOT a hero  they rushed service through the line you cant see them build your sandwich  They could not or would not  put sandwiches in a bag 1 tuna 1 ham lettuce  wrap 1 kind of cheese Husband didn't like the bread  He said next time  Subway more choices You can tell em what you want and see them build your sandwich  We won't be back"}
{"text":"The kids love Jimmy John's, and I must say I agree! Staff is always friendly, food always good, and restaurant always clean! Good to grab and go as well, for football games, lunch, after school snack, even dinner or parties! I like to buy the day old bread and make French toast for the kids in the morning - Yum!!"}
{"text":"Worst jimmy johns ever. Ordered a sandwich payed extra for avocado, didn't get any, ordered a club lulu, they forgot the bacon, called back and was met with some lame excuse \"I made it myself, I put 3 slices of bacon on it\" really? I used to work there, the portion is 5, you unprofessional butt plug. Poor customer service. Delivery driver was great tho! Still love JJs even if this location blows."}
{"text":"First time here, wasn't disappointed.  I got a veggie sandwich and it was perfect. Really good food, try the cookies!"}
{"text":"So, after my last horrible experience, I had sworn to never order from Jimmy John's again, however as luck would have it, I had zero time to go out to grab lunch for myself, and before I knew it, it was 2pm and I was starving.  The \"fastest\" delivery near my work is JJ, so I sucked it up and ordered a sandwich for delivery as soon as possible.  It has now been over an hour since I ordered.....still no sandwich to be seen.  I spoke with the manager, Drake at the store TWICE now, and he has been unhelpful and has offered no alternatives to get me my order.  I suppose now the only option is to cancel my order, because obviously this sandwich has been taken on a joyride and I'm not paying for my sub to be hitting the town for a good time.  I will truly never Ever EVER go back or order from there again.  EDIT: driver just showed up with my sandwich, an 1.5 hours after I ordered it. He informed me that he had just gotten on shift 10 minutes ago, and was given the sandwich. However, the manager Drake had told me my sandwich was out for delivery more than 40 minutes ago...so I smell an even bigger rat than before.  Order was canceled, and sandwich was sent back with the driver."}
{"text":"This location is full of young, lazy, rude punks! Seriously, I don't know how they are in business. Ordered a sub & they didn't even ask how I wanted it, I asked if they could not put Smoked Ham on my Italian Nightclub Sub they said \"NO\" so I ordered the smaller Vito.....you get literally THREE Slices of Capocollo (they don't even spell it right on the menu) with a Tablespoon of Lettuce & 1 Slice Cheese cut in half - RIDICULOUS!!! Besides the kindergarten portion meat of Jimmy John's, this location treats you like you're bothering them!!! You want A REAL DEAL SUB SANDWICH???? GO TO FIREHOUSE!!! You get 4-5 Times MORE MEAT & they are HAPPY to customize your Sub to YOUR liking!!! JJ's Lake Pleasant SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"I'll just start by saying I love Jimmy Johns. I always get the Pepe with onions and oregano... Today I didn't want the lettuce or onions because I have onions and leaf lettuce at home I wanted to use, so I ordered the Slim 1. The cashier informed me I wasn't allowed to have oregano on my sub because it was a slim and didn't include vegetables. I find this strange.. They were allowed to give me mayo packets but not a few dashes of oregano? Boooooooooo dissapointed"}
{"text":"Chain or not (and because if you're like me, you've never really run into one of these before), I had to post about Jimmy J's. AWESOME sandwiches (better than Subway and Quizno's as far as the chains go, as far as I'm concerned) served super fresh and super fast. I know, I sound like a commercial or something, but this place is really awesome. And you're not sacrificing cheapness for the quality and speed; it's very reasonable for the sandwich.   I always get my sandwich (usually turkey or roast beef) on the wheat bread, which is fresh and AMAZING, but you can get it on sourdough/french too. I always add peppers and oil and vinegar, but that's just me. You really can't go wrong. And like I said, it's SOOO fast, and they always get your order right. As has been mentioned elsewhere, they have tons of options, a huge staff for such a small in-and-out store (no seating), so it's always an easy experience. If you go during the lunch crush, though, you'll get just that: a crunch. Tons of people descend on this one, but the crowd is always handled incredibly efficiently.   Wow, I just talked a lot about a sandwich place."}
{"text":"Fastest sandwich made ever. As I'm being handed my change and receipt, I'm being handed my order -- two large freshly made Clubs... Tuna and Beach, both of which were tasty good. Nice job, fellas."}
{"text":"It's across the street... South east corner of 101 and Tatum. Good subs. Bread could've bees fresher."}
{"text":"When a chain sandwich place uses the word \"Gourmet\" in their name, and you walk inside and on the walls there is a written disclaimer that they are really just basic sandwiches, but the founder's Mom said they should be called \"gourmet\" to be successful, - you should believe the disclaimer.  I had heard great reviews on this place - mainly on the radio - you know, when the jocks are talking and say \"and we are sampling DELICIOUS subs courtesy of Jimmy John's today\".  Sure they're delicious. The manager of Jimmy Johns brought them by in the hopes they would be talked about and drum up some business. Have you ever heard a radio guy talk down (let alone TURN down) free food?  Neither have I.   I ordered my sandwich \"sans bread\", hoping to forego some of the carbs - and truthfully - the bread choices- a \"french bread roll\" or thickly sliced wheat bread - looked boring and bland to me. My friend got some sort of roast beef sandwich on the french bread roll (which, by the way- I was right about . Boring), and I had turkey and cheese wrapped in lettuce with tomato. Mine was ok. It actually tasted like a salad with much more mayo than I would ever put (dressing) on a salad.   Nothing here would compel me to go back. Same for my friend. He had heard \"gourmet sandwiches\" and co-workers talking the place up. He couldn't believe everything was cold. There was not a hot sandwich to be had. We could have made better sandwiches at home. There was nothing terrible, but certainly nothing remarkable. Subway would have been just as satisfying, if you catch my drift.   Other than a few mildly cleverly worded signs, the decor was basically non-existent. It reminded me of a place you'd find on a college campus, only with less character.  The prices were ok - 4.95 - 6.95 (from what I saw) - but then again, I could have made it at home - so it wasn't really a \"deal\".    Jimmy John's Really No More than Average Sandwiches. Truth in advertising."}
{"text":"The punks behind the counter are retards, pick another location if you have to have a Jimmy John's sandwich.  As a result of my experience at this location, I will never eat at Jimmy John's again.  I can go to Subway and get what I want without the bullshit attitude like this place serves up."}
{"text":"Always so fast and friendly here. Fresh bread, fresh meet and order always accurate. Great customer service by the owner too!"}
{"text":"We come here every couple weeks so my son can eat before a sporting lesson. When the guy sees us, my sons sandwich is made before we even pay because he remembers his order. Very fast service, friendly, and good grub!!"}
{"text":"My sister in law and her fiance took us to Jimmy Johns after discovering it. The location is really convenient to us, which is great.  I enjoyed my sandwich. The branding is a little intense. EVERYTHING, right down to the chips, is branded with the Jimmy John's logo. It's all good but it's a little crazy.  The sandwiches are big and the cookies they sell by the register are huge! Prices don't seem too bad either. A nice sandwich stop."}
{"text":"Probably the best and quickest service I've ever had from a delivery restaurant in my life. By the time I got off the phone, changed my clothes they were knocking at my door and the sub was great!  Great service"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I first visited this location when they opened. The staff was overly friendly (seemed like the franchise owner behind the register.)  I just visited again and a totally different experience. The guy at the register wasn't engaging or even very friendly. I ordered a large drink and the only straws were extremely short and didn't fit the height of the cup. When I asked if they had longer straws, the staff looked at me as though I was from another planet.  I then asked if I could have a bag. The staff pointed to a stack of bags sitting on the counter. Work ethic and customer service are effectively non- existent today, and this Jimmy John's is no exception. Take the extra 10 seconds to open a bag and place the customer's items in the bag.  This franchise WILL NOT survive in this neighborhood. Their location is horrible -- tucked in a back corner of an L-shaped shopping center. The staff here is going to HAVE to step it up in order to survive!  I hope the franchise owners will take these comments to heart."}
{"text":"I have had jimmy john's before and have always eaten in, but have never had it delivered before. And keeping in mind i had always heard that they deliver so quickly and never actually knew how FAST it would be. I ordered online and went into the back of my office and came out and THEY WERE THERE ALREADY HERE! Took maybe 5 minutes, and it tasted so amazingly fresh. SO happy!!!"}
{"text":"My 4th time ordering from this location and the 4th time I am frustrated.  My meal is always delivered after 30 minutes and I work across the street.  Last time they forgot bacon and avocado which I paid extra for.  Currently typing as I am waiting for my meal again after 50 minutes has passed.   I used to work in arrowhead mall, I would order my food and within 10 minutes I had it."}
{"text":"The staff is always fast and very friendly. Try the beach club with extra hot peppers. It blows subway out of the water."}
{"text":"Of all the Jimmy John's I have been to, this one was the best tasting.  I'm so happy that there is a Jimmy John's on Brunswick! My delivery driver was very friendly also. Keep him on board!"}
{"text":"Heard good things.  They aren't true.  Very little meat.  Lettuce and cucumber sandwich, pasty bread. Nothing special, just fastfood."}
{"text":"Love the Beach Club!!!   Can't wait till my next visit.  Thanks for making such a great sandwich with great ingredients!!!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from them twice.  Both times it was super fast and both times the sandwich (IIRC it's called the Gargantuan) was delicious."}
{"text":"It's not the greatest sandwich, but it's fast, cheap, and good. I like Capriotti's a lot better, but their sandwiches are a bit more pricey. For the money, Jimmy John's can't be beat.  The service isn't the best or most helpful. The decor is definitely geared to the college-aged crowd and the prices match it.  The french rolls that the subs come on are soft, crusty, and chewy. The meats that I've had were very flavorful, unlike the meats at most Subways.  If you're looking for a good, quick, and cheap sandwich, this is good. And their delivery service, for just one sandwich, that makes it worth keeping on your speed dial if you're in their delivery area."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  The big red head manager was very difficult to work with. We tried to get a side of peppers and he refused to do so."}
{"text":"Good food, fast delivery, but they need to improve training with customer service. The guy taking my delivery order by phone sounded so uninterested and like he hated life all together. I work in customer service and have to constantly strive for excellence, so it sucks when others just get by."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch today. I have only had Jimmy John's 1 time before at the Central Phoenix Location and a year ago, and was not really blown away by their style of Subs. Today I didn't quite few like my usual Sub stop for my work lunch break down the street, so I thought I'd give Jimmy's another try. Again I found I would only give the sub sandwich a moderate score, but it was the service and the manager (at least he seemed in charge) going the extra mile after one of their (newer I'm guessing) employees made a mistake on cleaning the windows. When the employee went to the clean the door and windows, he sprayed the Windex like crazy and the fan totally blew it all over my table. Before I could even react to the situation, the manger was correcting the employee for the bad cleaning technique decision and immediately offered to make me a new sandwich even though I only had about a 1/4 left. In less than a minute I had my new sub, which I will actually have for breakfast in the morning.   I understand that everyone makes mistakes and that often at fast food joints it is an employee's first job, so I usually expect the management to make right any of the blunders, without the customer having to raise a fuss. This Jimmy John's location has delivered that level of quality in customer service and I plan on returning. Also, after looking over the menu a bit more, I think maybe I will like the subs better if I add a few of the \"freebies\" to my sub next time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for a quick bite to eat. The portions are generous and, contrary to the stigma they hold, they are reasonably priced. All of the ingredients taste fresh and the quality is better in comparison to some other sub shops nearby. The people inside are either super nice or super standoffish there doesn't really seem to be an in between, but I don't go there for the friendly service, I go there for their quick service which they definitely provide. They do not fall short in delivery either. They advertise \"freaky fast delivery\" and they deliver on their word. Luckily the food is better than my puns. Plus their app is extremely convenient and accepts Apple Pay which is a huge plus for me personally. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Oh Jimmy, I heart you. I've been to this location twice, and both during the lunch rush. The line was to the door, but service is super quick. I was in and out in probably less than 10 minutes. My sandwich of choice is the #4 Turkey Tom (add cheese/no sprouts), or if I'm really hungry, the #12 Beach Club (no sprouts). The bread has a bit of a crunch, but still super soft. The meat, cheese & veggies are always fresh and delicious. Their own brand of chips are also really yum. I suggest the jalapeno and BBQ. My only gripe is that if you're ordering for more than yourself, you have to remember the order and pay attention because that's how they call it out when it's done. I'm more of a fan of the numbering system, such as \"Number 12! Your order is ready!\""}
{"text":"The quality, speediness and taste of the sandwiches of this location is no different than the awesomeness of the Camelback location. So this review is to comment on the employees. As I pulled into a parking space, one employee was leaving on a delivery. He smiled big and waved to me. What a nice gesture!   It was late in the afternoon and there were no other customers inside. There were two employees, with their backs to the door, leaning against the counter, up against each other. When they heard me walk in, they quickly turned and separated. Now I know they are teenagers, and madly in love, but it was very unprofessional. They should at least be turned to see the door, so they when a customer is approaching! They were still polite and sold me some of yesterday's bread (soooo delicious and so worth the $0.45/each!). He was even friendly and asked what I'd be making with them. Sandwiches. Duh. I did tell them, though, about the yummy carne asada tortas we had made with them a couple weeks ago!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but I don't think we'll be coming back. While my boyfriend was eating his vegetarian sandwich, he was horrified to find a chunk of tuna in with it. The worst part is they advertise being vegetarian friendly with a big \"We love vegetarians\" sign on the wall. If that were the case, you'd think they would put a little more care into keeping meat out of their vegetarian sandwiches. To a vegetarian that's like finding a cockroach in with your meal. ;-) It's a shame because I enjoy their sandwiches. But this is definitely not a vegetarian-friendly establishment."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches but the service is the worst I've seen out of all of their locations. The staff seems more concerned about hanging out than giving customer service. I have no problem with loud music, except when it's over lunch. TURN IT DOWN!!!"}
{"text":"Always has great service, quick like a lick, and the employees are such good lookers. Their tomatoes are especially spot on. It's hard to find a good tomato on a sandwich these days, and man I tell you, these tomatoes are always fresh and not mushy. Great."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's has the best subs in Tempe hands down. All their sandwhichs are 8 inches and pretty inexpensive. They put the mayo on the bread, which is so much better than the between the cheese and meat thing they do at subway. The assembly line of sandwhich makers insures your sandwhich is made and waiting for you before you could walk to the soda fountain. Located in the heart of Mill and open late, its the best place for munchies after a night of drinking. My only complaint would be that the music in there is too loud during the day. I've been there twice in the afternoon and im not sure if its because the manager isnt there or what, but the music is so loud you have to raise your voice to talk to the person your with . Other than that, Jimmy John's is my favortie sandwhich the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"My daughter ordered our sandwiches ahead of time. The place was packed around 12:30 PM. So difficult to get to the soda machine which is located where you pick up your sandwiches. Other than that, I loved the french bread and everything in it was fresh. I ordered the Vito sandwich which had Genoa salami, provolone, capicola, onion, lettuce and tomato topped with an Italian vinaigrette which I barely tasted. There own chips are like the Maui chips thick and crunchy. I'll be back to try something different."}
{"text":"How do they do it?!  I could barely speak the words of what I wanted in my order - based on the number 13 menu item, and then boom! There it was.  I don't mean to sound like a complicated order, but I know that I was pretty particular and it should have taken a little longer considering the line of people who seemed to be ahead of me.  But somehow, they had my order ready in what seemed like one minute and everyone else seemed to disappear behind my gluttonous inhales of delicious simplicity that is otherwise a deli sandwhich.  I will have to re-visit that place. Stand by."}
{"text":"I've heard all the hype about JJ's for a few months now.  In need of lunch I figured this would be a good time to give them a shot!  Why not I thought, a good number of people I know tried them and thought they were good.  This should be a pretty safe bet.  Strike 1 - Complete confusion with my order of two subs on-line!  They promote the fact you can order on-line, but whats the point if it takes three employees who ask what your name is 5 times!  Strike 2 - The fresh baked French bread was rock hard, and had no flavor what so ever.  You should promote fresh baked bread, if it comes off as being a few days old.  Strike 3 - The sub was named Smoked Ham Club.  If you use the word \"smoked\" to describe the ham that is used, it should have a smoked flavor!  In actuality, you will get the saltiest lowest quality tasting ham that can be sold.  My only hope for this franchise is that other locations have a much higher standard.  If this is how every location is quality wise,  JJ's will not last very long in the Valley."}
{"text":"Worst service by far. I came in the drive thru and I can see the kid with his headset on ignoring the call. He takes it off and leaves it on the counter to keep ignoring the drive thru. I drive up and knock on the window and he continues to deliberately ignore me. Never will you get any of my money again Jimmy Johns. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Come on guys! Normally you have been 5 Stars the last 50 visits but today you only deserve at 3.5 or 4! This is not my normal #10!"}
{"text":"Consistent with the brand, this location makes a great sandwich very quickly.   This new location has plenty of parking and is clean inside. The friendly staff greeted us right away and were ready to take our orders. We barely had time to step aside when we were called that our orders were ready. I love that! Jimmy John's is definitely going to be at the top of my list when I'm in a rush.  I ordered the Vito and it was delicious. There was plenty of meat and vegetables on delicious bread. My husband also loved his sandwich. We shared a chocolate chip cookie that was very good. I normally wouldn't grab dessert from a sub shop, but this was a great cookie. The food here is affordable making it a good option for an inexpensive meal on the go."}
{"text":"Consistent!  These guys and gals make really good sandwiches really really fast.  The staff are friendly, upbeat, and accommodating.    Always enjoy JJs."}
{"text":"So glad they added this location to the neighborhood.  It used to be a coffee shop.  Now it's a great sandwich shop.  Love it!  I had the Tommy Tom unwhich and it was so tasty"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's provides good sandwiches for a reasonable price. I enjoy the simplicity of Jimmy John's sandwiches. They hit the spot when I crave a good sub sandwich. My favorite is the #4 Turkey Tom. They also have freaky fast delivery, but I usually go to the store, where they are also quite efficient at maintaining a short wait for one's sandwich."}
{"text":"I have been a Jimmy John's fan for years.  Was disappointed in the delivery time and service of this store.  I live two blocks from this establishment which just recently opened (2 and a half weeks or so ago).  After not receiving my order within 30 minutes I called the store.  When I called I was asked if I could be placed on hold (I said yes) and then I was hung up on as the person did not know how to work the phones.  When I called back, I was told it would be delivered in 5 minutes.  15 minutes later I called back and was told that the person couldn't seem to find my apartment building (but confirmed the address online was accurate) and they could no longer get ahold of their driver.  It took more than an hour to deliver a sandwich two blocks.  The person was nice enough to remake and comp the meal, but don't say \"freakishly fast\" delivery if it is going to be \"ridiculously slow\".  Maybe a fluke, but not a good start in Old Town (no one is critical here) for a new business."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, convenient, tasty, and comparable prices to Subway.  My #1 choice is the roast beef (Big John's). I usually don't like white bread, but the French bread here is pretty hard to pass up."}
{"text":"My fiancé has purchased sandwiches from this location a couple of times and he loves it. My review is based on the lack of willingness to make any substitutions. I walked in and informed the guy I am pregnant so I can not eat deli meats. I can however eat salami as its a cold processed meat and does not contain the possible bacterial contamination of deli meats. I asked if they could make me just a salami sandwich, he informed me they have one that's half salami and half capicola that they could pick off the capicola. I'm not satisfied with that response for two reasons, 1 capicola is a deli meat and the bacteria would transfer to the salami thus defeating the purpose. Then secondly I was told he could not substitute the capicola for salami that I would have to pay a double meat charge. All in all this was a disappointing experience and I will not be returning, as for my fiancé im going to ask the same from him."}
{"text":"Great service and sandwich. I love their bread and how  fresh they are. I wish they had Pepper to put on the sandwich but other than that it was great."}
{"text":"I really don't know what some people are complaining about. Every time I have been to this location the employees are friendly the the sandwich is spot on. The Bread is perfect and tastes delicious."}
{"text":"I've been to a few different Jimmy Johns locations but this is my favorite. Maybe because it's very close to my work but also maybe because it's very clean and the service is always friendly. I get the same thing every time, the beach club, and I'll continue to get this item every time. The bread is soft and addicting and I've never received a bad order. Even when my order is delivered I still get delicious sandwiches in a freaky fast amount of time. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's convenience appeals to my geeky tech side. Hellman's Mayo, jalapeno and bbq chips, pickles, bread and cold cuts tickle my taste buds.Whether its walk in location or at-your-discretion gratuity/delivery charge, Jimmy John's convenience can't be beat.  --iPhone app --Website --online account lets me save my credit cards, delivery addresses and phone numbers, and i can even name and customize my favorite sandwiches  My favorite is #9, extra onion, light mayo, extra sprouts, plus cucumber.  Jimmy John's is my quick fix for a great sandwich, NOW."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better is right! Haven't had Jimmy John's in about two years and now I remember why.  We got lunch at work today and nothing seemed to taste right. My sandwich (#9) had a pure olive oil vinaigrette... like NO vinegar. Tried to scrap everything off that was touching it so I didn't have to taste the tablespoons of olive oil poured onto my sandwich. Another girl had 3 whole pieces of meat on her sandwich. If getting a plain sandwich, at the very least remember to add the meat to it."}
{"text":"We are on an Amtrak train from Carbondale to Chicago, as I type, and we couldn't bring ourselves to eat the snack car gruel.  We were scheduled to arrive in Champaign at 6:50, and we called ahead to place a delivery order for two sandwiches. We expected them to tell us to get lost, but the guy who took our order didn't skip a beat. Even when we were 10 minutes late, the delivery guy wasn't that annoyed. Who would have guessed you could get food delivery on a train?!  We're now stopped at the Gilman Amtrak station and just finished our sandwiches. Thanks, JJ. You saved us from rail dysentery."}
{"text":"I'll let the experience speak for itself: myself and two coworkers ordered lunch 3 sandwiches 3 unsweet teas 2 cookies and 2 chips 45 minutes later half of the food showed up and when I asked the delivery guy where it was he took what they made back and went back to the store the manager then called and was rude apparently the online order messed up.... Ok fine so we repaid requested that our food be made fresh because at this point it had been ordered an hour ago... So the driver comes back leaves it and the front counter and runs out before I can talk to him and still manages to short us one cookie and a bag of chips.... mind you at this point it's been almost an hour and 45 mins since we ordered our food suffice to say we won't be using this Jimmy Johns again and we won't be recommending their catering services to our clients... Which is a shame because this is the worst Jimmy John's experience I've had by a country mile usually they are genuinely nice and fast this location is neither"}
{"text":"Very fast service and they always greet you with a smile.   Only giving 4 stars because they don't have a lot of condiments. I have to get mustard packets if I want mustard on my sandwich.   Jimmy Johns is way better than SubWay.  I often order the bread by itself."}
{"text":"My wife and I always stop by Jimmy Johns when in Vegas- fast and delicious.  My only bone to pick with this location is that they keep shrinking the delivery radius.  In the past, they would deliver to the Wynn.  Then to Hooters.  Next it was Motel 6.  Makes it harder and harder to get our Jimmy Johns fix!  Also, longer hours would be nice- Vegas is a 24 hour town but Jimmy Johns is closed by 8 many days."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is a really good clean nice place to eat... I love the number 14 with bacon sprouts and cucumbers with of course lettuce tomato onion I order at least once or twice a week... I have no complaints because, if anything is wrong it is always corrected... Thank you Jimmy John's for all your good service and your fabulous tasting sandwiches!..."}
{"text":"So damn good! Soft perfect bread every time, employees are rock stars, and the customer service is fantastic!!"}
{"text":"First time ever to a Jimmy Johns, will NOT go back. The guy at the front register seemed like he didn't want to be there. I ordered a roast beef and cheese sub and a drink. I went and got my drink and the sub was ready by the time I got back to the pick up counter. I took the sub and then I opened it when I got to my truck.... I was very upset about the very bare sandwich of meat and cheese and the sub roll that I got was SO dry that it was actually hard to swallow. The sandwich taste was not that great at all. So, don't go here, take your business to subway."}
{"text":"Love JJ but bread was stale, maybe because it was toward the end of the night but quality should never be compromised .  I bought 4 sandwiches for my family and all we kept talking about is how stale the bread was.  Had to throw out the sandwiches ."}
{"text":"how can anyone not like jimmy john's? the number 6 is the perfect eat-at-my-desk-lunch."}
{"text":"I would give them more stars awesome food and it is fast but they won't deliver to my area and we only have one in our city .  We need more of them in my city on well ."}
{"text":"wow could not believe how many people rated JJ's so low because \"subway is better\"  subway is terrible, if you uphold all your sandwich shops to subway, your opinion doesn't matter and you should stop writing reviews  jimmy johns gives you only the freshest ingredients and best meats and cheeses, so fast its like walking away after you order and someone throwing your sandwich in your mouth!  italian nightclub, onions only. boom."}
{"text":"The manager reached out to me right away and was very friendly and compassionate. Based on his response I would return again!"}
{"text":"Great, fast delivery and excellent customer service. Would be 5 stars except for the fact that their bread has been very hard lately."}
{"text":"Friendly service and fast delivery. The food is always good and they always get the order right!"}
{"text":"Ok...I wish you could do a 3.5 because that's what my rating would be...but since you can't...  The subs are really good (specifically the #5) and they're usually made quickly which is nice..my only complaint is that for some reason, they can't do ingredients on only half of the sandwich or just put them on the side altogether for those of us who don't like onion. This really makes no sense to me so maybe I'm missing something but it's kind of a pain in the ass. Other than that, the employees are friendly. I'll keep coming back most likely but it might be something that should be considered."}
{"text":"We ate lunch at this new location for lunch yesterday. Just wanted to say that I was very impressed with all of the employees. A veteran came in and they were over the top kind to him and kept telling him thank you for his service. Was just impressed :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE Jimmy Johns and ever since I found out they have come out to Arizona, I have been hooked! I typically go to this location because it's closest to my work. The place gets really busy during lunch so if you're in a hurry, I would set aside an extra 5 minutes to get your sandwich made. The service is a little lacking when it's busy, but that's because the workers have no breathing room... and neither do the customers by the receiving end of the line. I guess the layout of the store is a little odd, but it seems to work out, for the most part.  I highly recommend the Italian Night Club. It's like the smaller version of the ever-so-tasty Gargantuan.   Now... if there were more locations closer to Gilbert, I would be a happy woman!"}
{"text":"Is my Jimmy John's, closest to where I work. I've used them for dine in, carry out, and delivery to my place of business. They have never let me down on any account. Last week we ordered lunch for the staff and they got everything right. The sandwiches were correct, the pickles were cut right, and the delivery was right on time. When I go into the store to order, everybody is friendly, and they all say hello. The store is always clean, and the bathroom is always clean. They have an online ordering page which is very handy, but it's not as user-friendly to get set up, but once you're set up, it works very well."}
{"text":"I love their #9 sandwich.  You have to go in to find out what it is.  Now, I did order a #5 for someone and it looked fantastic.   I think I will have to try that next time."}
{"text":"My daughters love coming here for a sandwich.  It's their favorite place to go.  The sandwiches always taste so fresh to me.  The toppings are just enough  to not overpower the meat and cheese flavors.  A good balanced sandwich."}
{"text":"This location was great! Sandwiches met our expectations as always with JJ's, the atmosphere was fantastic with the music meeting the theme and energy of the restaurant.  The service was spot on and very friendly, greeting you as you walked through their doors.  Thank you for your service!"}
{"text":"They don't deliver to my house 1.5 miles away and do not have high chairs for my 1 year old. How do you expect me to eat here?"}
{"text":"Late night stop on my way home from work for a quick dinner solution...  staff was cleaning up the venue getting ready to close up shop and quickly disbursed back into \"customer service position\" when they noticed I pulled up. I was greeted with a smile and friendly (an extremely fast) service."}
{"text":"Kind of upset with this location specifically. I've been a long time Jimmy John's fan and I just moved closer to this location, so I decided to stop by and try it. I normally get a #5 Vito with extra vinegar and when I opened my sandwich I initially thought they just gave me bread... it was very upsetting. Very dry, I don't think there was any vinegar in it at all. I love Jimmy Johns and am willing to give this place another chance and hopefully they'll be able to hold up their standard. Until then... 2 stars."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for JJ when I'm on work travel in LV.  Even though I can expense my meals I'm not too excited about spending ~$30 on an average tasting meal that is usually on the unhealthy side and/or when it causes time on the porcelain throne.  The attraction with JJ is the combination of value (~$5.75 for 8\" sub), a tasty and healthy sub made from fresh baked bread, quality incredients, meats and fresh veggies and friendly convenient service.  Subway pales in comparison when it comes to taste, quality and freshness and usually Subway causes time on the throne so I tend to shy away from that place.  My current favorites are Beach Club, because I love sprouts, and Italian Night Club.  As far as locations, I usually hit up Maryland which is a little more spacious if I'm close to the strip or West Charleston if north of the strip.  I miss this place and hope they expand out to southern CA!"}
{"text":"Never been big on subs until I tried JJ while on business travel in LV.  To sum it up it's tasty, healthy, fresh, filling, a great value and most importantly doesn't  mess up my internal plumbing like Subway and, to a lesser extent, Quiznos do if you know what I mean.  I can fill up on one 8\" but usually pig out as much as I can on both the Beach Club and Italian Night Club since I know I will miss it when I go home.  I can honestly say it'll be hard to survive a LV trip without JJ."}
{"text":"Delivers! In downtown Phoenix!  On a Saturday!  While I still don't feel that this chain deserves the praise that many people give it, I have a new found appreciation for this location.  When you work downtown on weekends, your options are already limited.  And it's even harder to find a place that will bring the food to you."}
{"text":"I've never been a big fan of Jimmy John's. I've always felt that this sandwich chain was by far the most overrated. The only reason I've eaten at any location is because of the convenient and quick online ordering and delivery. But this weekend, this location failed at that.  My wife went out on girl's night with a friend while I stayed home with my young daughter. I ended up putting her to bed around 7:30pm and realized there really wasn't anything to eat in my house. Not wanting to have pizza for the third time this week, I figured a Jimmy John's sandwich would be quick and cheap. I went online and ordered. Waited. Then came the bad news.  About 20 minutes after placing my order, the voicemail notification on my phone chimed (of coarse this had to happen one of those times the phone didn't ring). I got a message from the manager that my order was canceled and refunded because the driver \"stepped out\" on her. While I'm sympathetic to her plight, I'm left frustrated, hungry, and with three options. Raiding the back of the freezer for that stuff that's been there for months but no one wanted to finish. Cereal for dinner. Or ordering from somewhere else and waiting at least another 30 minutes to eat.  Thanks JJ's.  I don't work in the customer service/hospitality business. But in my line of employment, when someone doesn't show up or leaves work, someone else is forced to step up (whether they like it or not). I probably could have called back and complained, but what would it have accomplished? It's not like I was going to leave my sleeping kid at home alone so I could go pick up the sandwich. And if Jimmy John's would like to make it up to me, the company obviously has my name, address, email and phone number.  **UPDATE** In my annoyance with this location, I decided to also write a complaint on Jimmy John's website. I didn't get a written response, but I was sent a $10 gift card a little more than a week after. I guess I will be trying JJ's again."}
{"text":"Only reason they get 1 star, is so I can comment.  We have ordered several times lately that it takes an hour.  Today I called and asked how long, told me 20 minutes.  An hour later I called, told \"We have been Freaky busy today, it will be 15-20 minutes\".  The order came, it was wrong, 2 of the sandwiches had guacamole on them, I ate it without realizing and I am allergic.  Needless to say now at work, going to be drowsy from the allergy meds I had to take.  The other girl called about her sandwich being wrong, was told it came that way, then told they would fix it and get back out to her.  It came, now with onions, which it does not come with.  I am saying NEVER AGAIN on this one.  Sorry, because it is normally a good sandwich, but not when you have missed your lunch and it is still wrong.  :("}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of the double J!  I usually go to the JJ near my office in the university area, but I got to hit up the Matthews location after running some errands on an off day.  I must have missed the lunch rush, but I walked in, ordered and was out of there in 5 min.    Though this location is missing the noise and energy of the other locations I am used to, the sandwich was good and what I was expected and they were very proficient in getting me on my way to a full belly and back to the office.  Location didn't really have a lot of tables to sit down and enjoy the awesomeness of JJ's, but there were enough.  The shopping center is fairly busy so parking looks to be tight.  I didn't really see that many drivers running in and out of this location, but I was only there for 5 mins (probably not enough time to judge how busy this location is)."}
{"text":"This JJ has a drive thru!!  If I didn't think JJ could perfect their simple, fast sandwich formula anymore.... I came upon this location that has a drive thru!  Located across the way from Concord Mills, this location is a bit weird to get to with the parking lot design, but still manageable.  Once you get inside, there's a large dining room (not what I've been used to seeing in other strip mall JJ locations).  Not sure what used to be here, but I am very glad JJ took over the space.  There were a number of diners inside - enjoying their lunch and we were about to be another satisfied group.  The staff was very friendly and efficient and we got our sandwiches super fast (as expected) and we were well on the way back to the office.  Can't beat speed - usually you sacrifice quality or $$ for extra time, but I think JJ's has a simple enough menu that they do it well and do it fast.  Don't expect any bells and customize-able sandwiches here... I like having my free time so the less I spend waiting on lunch to be prepared, the more time I have as \"down time\" from the office.  Don't get run over by the drivers going through the drive thru!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today.  There is always a lot of people running around this location... I could never figure out how profitable it is to deliver sandwiches for lunch-with the promise of fast delivery too.  This location is near my office... the parking lot is a little awkward to get in and out, but the service is quick, the food is consistently good, and the place is kept clean.  I don't stray too far from my #5 Vito straight up with chips and a drink."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times and they have messed up my order twice now. One time they totally forgot to put lettuce on so it was so boring and gross with tomato and no lettuce. The next time they forgot to put the mayo and cheese on my daughters sandwich that she asked for. I think the food tastes good, but they are so focused on making your sandwich fast that they forget to make it right. I would rather wait the extra couple minutes. I will still go back but I am annoyed. On a positive note, the staff is always super friendly and will smile and talk to you. They just opened so hopefully they will iron out the kinks."}
{"text":"I've recently fallen in love with Jimmy Johns because they come through on their turkey sandwiches. I like turkey sandwiches so much I probably eat them more at dinner than at lunch.  The bread is dense and chewy. They use Hellman's mayo. And the rest is fine and dandy.  I've frequented various locations and they really do live up to their \"freakin fast\" service, EXCEPT this location. Also, this is the only location that has shorted me on toppings. Yes, I did notice that you only put a smidgen of avocado on my Beach Club.  Attempted to use their delivery service, but they won't deliver to my office which is at Central and Osborn. The website doesn't offer any info on the delivery radius either."}
{"text":"I love these Italian sandwiches.  A little pricey for what you get, but you're not going to \"get\" anywhere else nearby.  =)"}
{"text":"Came out to have dinner with my nephews, after all the thanksgiving food, we wanted something light, decided on Jimmy John's. First off, this place is extremely clean, and to be honest when we arrived no one was inside. There were only 2 employees, but here's why I was impressed...there was 8 of us in our party, as we were deciding to order, one was taking the orders! While the other was making them on the spot, by the time we ordered all 8 sandwiches, 7 of them were already served! By the time I finished paying my sandwich which was the 8th, was already done! Talk about fast customer service, and efficient business. Way to go! Sandwiched were delicious, everyone enjoyed their food, but we all left impressed with the prompt & efficient service! Great work!"}
{"text":"Seriously the slowest Jimmy Johns of all times. Three times it's taken over an hour to bring my sandwich. I kept giving them chances, but I'm done. You all are horrrrribleeeee"}
{"text":"This is Jimmy Johns.  It's amazing Jimmy Johns subs at Jimmy Johns prices.  It's everything you would expect.  I work in the University area and they are freaky fast!  I have literally ordered, went to the bathroom and when I came out everyone was looking for me."}
{"text":"Good 8\" subs, great tasting bread.  A touch expensive at almost $7 but noticeably better quality than Subway.  An army of workers will have your sub finished quickly.  I could see it getting packed in this small location hidden in the corner.  The parking lot is tight and packed as well."}
{"text":"I eat at JJ's a lot and this location just can't get it right. Order the same thing every time and pay a different amount EVERY TIME I check out. Ask for no mayo and 9 out of 10 times I go home to find mayo. If it wasn't for the proximity to my home I wouldn't eat here"}
{"text":"I really wish Jimmy Johns would open some locations in Los Angeles.  It is a great lunch option.  The sandwiches are flavorful and filling.  The bread is quality and the toppings are fresh.  The staff at this location was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"The last three times I have ordered delivery from this location it has taken an hour or longer.  When you call to check on your order they always say, \"Oh, the driver is on their way.  It should only be another 5 minutes.\" Yeah right.  This is the slowest location EVER.  I only live 1.5 miles away, how can it possibly take an hour????   So unless you have an hour to kill before you decide you are hungry and want to eat, I would recommend another option."}
{"text":"If you want a solid, good flavored sandwich and you're short on time, Jimmy John's is the place to go.   Cold cuts, cheese, fresh bread. There really aren't any gimmicks here, just fast, delicious, simple sandwiches. Great service too. I usually order the Big John or the Italian Night Club.   This location is especially fast because there aren't any tables. You can lean against a counter and eat, but you'll have to stand.    I hear that Jimmy Johns is slowly creeping up in the north. I'm glad to have one so close to me when I can't decide what to eat. Their sandwiches are just fine for me!  Btw, not too pricey. Friendly staff. Solid all around."}
{"text":"Great store.  Clean,  staff is friendly and the food is fresh.  5 stars if they were open later.   Currently close at 6 pm each day."}
{"text":"Just not impressed. Sandwiches are mediocre,  bread isn't soft or crusty - more like a stale hoggie roll you buy at the grocery store.  The available veggies are limited. They have a solid advertising budget - the only thing they seem to excel at. In the fast food sandwich realm they are worse than subway. Want a great sandwich go to porta subs or Mr. Goodcents."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is unique in the fact that they do actually make subs so fast you'll freak. Their catch phrase is really put to work at this location, and others.   My faves are the beach club, for the sprouts, and the country club (add bacon) for just being a simple sandwich. I also favor their slim subs, which cost less, and don't have a ton of toppings/meat and cheese.   The bread is tasty, soft, with a light crunch on the outside. Also they have awesome chips. No lame Lays or Cheetohs. It's the Jimmy John's brand chips and I favor the salt and vinegar.  I've always had good service here as well."}
{"text":"Love JJs, but I expect my order to be correct. If I say no onions, you confirm that you typed in no onions and I start to eat my sandwich and it has onions; that is bad customer service. #jjfail"}
{"text":"Not much to say that hasn't already been said. They have great sandwiches and funny signs on the wall. I would eat there again for sure. The diet coke was also really good for some reason."}
{"text":"They don't deliver to their community yet. Sad 5 minutes away and they won't deliver across the street from 75th avenue.   I guess I'll eat somewhere else.    Maybe they should reach out to Pizza Hut and see where they deliver to."}
{"text":"Soooooo I came in here because the yoshinoya place I had just went to was disgusting and I threw out the beef bowl I bought... I kept it simple. Turkey and bacon. The guy seemed annoyed that I had to decide what I wanted. Then slapped it together without even giving me a chance to ask for what I wanted o  it. In a rush to work I just paid and left. When I opened the sandwich it was on stale hard bread. Low quality meat and mushy tomatoes. Perhaps today I was not meant to eat lunch. :/ at least it was slightly more edible than the place next door!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here! I called to report something to the manager over the phone about an employee. When the manager became confrontational, I ended the call. A few minutes later, I got a call back from the manager asking for my name. When I told him I wouldn't give it to him, he said he only needed my number to call me back. If the management is rude and harasses customers that try to contact about legitimate concerns, what does it say about the place. I found out the managers name was Jarred which he refused to tell me by the way."}
{"text":"Asked for a giant size #11 to be wrapped as two separate halves as I would eat a half in store and the other one later.  Was told they can't do that. I'd need order 2 separate regular size subs at a premium for that.   When greed breeds idiocy....  Ham tasted weird"}
{"text":"Not good!! I've been wanting to try this place for a while now...first off, it's quite pricey for a basic sandwich. No flavor! Turkey is cheap...barely any toppings on the sandwiches. No flavor. I was sadly disappointed & will not return. Firehouse Subs & Jersey Mike's are WAY better & better prices too."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand why everyone rants and raves about this place.  It is a sub shop that is ran by unhelpful and rushed college kids.  They do not allow many choices and its kind of similar to in-and-out (regarding the atmosphere, not food).  They received 2 stars instead of 1 becaues they are very fast which is good if you are in a rush for lunch."}
{"text":"Ever since Jimmy Johns came to town I've never met a quicker sub sandwich place around. Today was no exception to the rule. My son loves their sandwiches so after school today I went to order him one. They had it ready and handed to me before I even finished paying. I was literally in and out in under five minutes. The employees were fast and friendly and greeted me the second I came in. If you haven't tried one of their sandwiches I recommend the number 9 or the gargantuan if you're really hungry. My husband loves it and it always fills him up."}
{"text":"I work across the street from this location and my coworkers and I would order from here at least once a week... The last time we ordered from them 3 of us payed with debit over the phone and were all charged wayyyy more than we signed for on our cards. This was very upsetting and makes you wonder how many other people have been screwed over and over payed without their permission. Thankfully we check our accounts and realized the over charges. One sandwich and our cards were charged $20?! Horrible and inexcusable. Needless to say we do not feel comfortable ordering from this location anymore."}
{"text":"All I wanted was some food. I called & they said their cut off street is Baseline on Power rd. I'm on power & Guadalupe. They gave me the number for Jimmy John's on power and Ray I called them they said I'm out of their 2mile delivery restriction and the closest one would be the one on power and southern so basically all I'm hearing is that both refuse to deliver this is poor customer service! I will never use either one of these locations or Jimmy John's in general to cater any more of our office parties after today"}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns delivery section is STUPID!!! I live on Hilgley and Brown, they are located on Mc Kellips, they will deliver to Alta Mesa if I meet them on Brown Rd.!!! Seriously? How stupid, they stated they can not deliver south of Brown, only to houses on Brown. I told them the houses that back of the houses are on Brown!! I swear each one has a different rule! When I use them to deliver to my work they make an exception because they dont want to loose buisness from my company, well you just did and no i will NOT be using you to cater anymore of my office funtions either!!"}
{"text":"Less than a 2mile drive & they won't even deliver!! This seams to be a problem with certain Jimmy John locations!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good but management has consistently been rude.  They got our order wrong once after delivery and when they diverted the correct sandwich- charged us for it (note- until this we had ordered at least once every 2 weeks for our family). This rudeness has continued in a number of situations- good thing there is a Subway close"}
{"text":"The place is clean and the protein portions skimpy, but credit the staff for hustle."}
{"text":"James, Daniel, & Eddie Were Absolutely Great. Very Fast Friendly Service. I will definitely be back. Thanks Guys!"}
{"text":"I found my first experience with the unwich to be a delightful treat.  I must eat gluten free so I am always wary of the ability of sandwich shops to meet my needs.  They did a wonderful job of keeping my unwich from cross-contamination and I loved every bite of the all veggie choice (sans avocado spread which couldn't be verified gluten free).  I did find it a bit odd that all of there deli meats had gluten but better safe than sorry.  If I had written this review yesterday I would have given 5 stars.  However, today I ordered the same unwich for dinner and was pretty disappointed by how wilted and even brown pieces of the lettuce holding the unwich together were.  I would expect crisp and fresh lettuce since the lettuce is a key player here.  All in all, I'd go back and keep my fingers crossed for fresher lettuce."}
{"text":"We were so dissatisfied with our lettuce sandwiches. Hardly any meat or cheese. Both sandwiches were overpriced and untasty. I had the italian and my wife had the roast beef. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Wow... literally just walked out and can't believe how awful the service is. Walked in at 9:08 and asked \"are you guys still open?\" One of the workers responded \"uhh yeah until 9:30 I guess\" and then the guy at the register looked at me and said \"I'm ready\" after rolling his eyes. Didn't know I was causing such a headache by ordering a sandwich during business hours. It's like this every time I go. Whoever the owner is needs to get some new employees."}
{"text":"Fast isn't always better. After I placed my order the cashier said \"Is that it?\" and I said \"and a cookie, and\" and the cashier said \"Your total is 8.38\" Half your job as a cashier is upselling and the cashier didn't even give me a chance to order a drink. I could have said \"and a drink\" after he gave me my total but I didn't want to give this business anymore money.  Oh, and the place was dead. I was the only person there so it's not like it was a lunch rush.  Food is good though, but it's a chain so the food is consistent across the nation"}
{"text":"A small on-line order for lunch .. ended up growing to eight sandwiches. Every order was made perfectly and a very handsome employee even carried my box to the car.   This location is the best !!  xxxxooooooo"}
{"text":"This Jimmy Johns was not \"freaky fast\". We had to wait over 15 minuets just to order, there was no one else in line... and the only two workers prioritized phone orders. After our order was finally placed the worker began to slowly make our order and half way through left to answer more phone calls in no hurry."}
{"text":"For a quick serve place this place is 5 stars!!!  Speedy, fresh and different! The un sandwich is wrapped in lettuce and is a fun change!  The chips are crunchy and mighty flavorful.  Even the drinks are special...the ice is really fine ...so the drink is like a slushy...also...drum roll ...they deliver!  This one is near my office...but a girl can dream that one will open by her home one day:)"}
{"text":"Dropped in this Jimmy John's last night after practice to catch up with Missy F. and Sarah R.   Conveniently located across the street from Mesa Community College - Well, at least when the roadwork on Southern isn't a mess and a half.  Nothing much to say, since we already know the subs are freaky fast and freaky delicious. There's a reason Jimmy John's is a college mainstay for many: Fast, affordable, delivery option, good cure for a \"case of the munchies\" ... Oops, did I really say that?!   My lettuce wrapped \"unwich\" #12 hold the mayo and cheese was no exception.   Friendly customer service. The guys working greeted us on our way in and out.   Also, it was super clean (at least what we could see) - even the bathrooms were damn near spotless for a \"fast food\" joint.   Surely, this location will come in handy during outdoor track season with all the meets nearby."}
{"text":"This Jimmy John's can be summed up as follows:  1) Delicious #4 Turkey Tom, hold the mayo, add avocado, onions and sprouts.   2) Nasty, rude AF employees.   I came in here on the way to my weightlifting competition on 2/4 to pick up a giant sandwich to inhale after weigh-ins.   The woman at the counter (around 10:40 AM) didn't acknowledge my presence except with a nasty look. Didn't utter a single word the entire time I was there.   Seriously, I was the one who had been water and carb cutting all week - If I can not have a crusty attitude after that, you can be a decent human being.   It costs $0.00 to provide decent customer service, and you can even fake it. Whoa, dude!   Yeah, kick rocks, I'll go a couple miles down the street to the San Tan Gateway location even though this one is practically steps away from the gym."}
{"text":"Normally, I wouldn't give a chain eatery four stars. Call me a snob if you will.   Don't get me wrong, Jimmy John's makes some delicious subs. And yes, they're freaky fast, whether you eat in or have it delivered.   Went there a lot in college; still come in from time to time now as I work nearby.  The #12 Beach Club and #13 Gourmet Veggie Sub are my standbys. I also love that they'll lettuce wrap your sandwich for you, which saves a boatload of calories!  While I've been to this location several times, it's the customer service I received today that stands out.  Gabby helped me place a catering order for a Women's Leadership Council I'm a part of.   We have a lot of members that have dietary restrictions or food allergies, and Gabby was extremely patient with me as I read off all our custom boxed lunch orders. Good on her, I probably would have lost my cool.   I will often help with catering orders for trainings, meetings, etc. the company I work for hosts, so it's good to know I can rely on Jimmy Johns to feed our hungry guys that work out in the field for trainings, sales meetings, or anything else we may have here.   Ray and 54th Street Jimmy Johns: Y'all kick ass!"}
{"text":"They are fast!  They also have a #14 Bootlegger Unwich that is just the ticket for low-carb eating!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the quickness & freshness.  I also love that I can \"unwich\" anything!  I love the #14 Bootlegger & I add cucumbers!  Yummy deli delight!"}
{"text":"Love there subs.  Service is fast and friendly.  Dining area is cozy.  Male restroom has really interesting decor.  Recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"I made up my mind not to return to this one, but I was on my way home last night and I went to this one because it was closer to me.  Well I really shouldn't have, the experience that I had a few days before this one can't compare to what I experienced last night.  I went in around 8:30 or so ordered my food, the guy who was operating the cash register wasn't paying attention him and the one that was actually making the sandwiches were busy playing name that tune from the loud music playing and reliving their dreams of playing in the NBA with shooting baskets in the trash can with paper.  Everything I ordered I didn't get, I clearly didn't ask for a cookie, and guess what I was charged for it when I realized that I let the guy no and he was like well ok never said well let me take care of that charge for you or anything.  So the one making the food said well ma'am I will give you what you asked for and the cookie to, I said sure what ever.  Being that you can't actually see them make your food you really don't realize what's going on, and you can't see the receipt until you get your food by then you are out the door and that's it.  Well I got home ready to eat because I was starving and I got a breadless sandwich.  Exciting I know, but if I wanted a salad I would have ordered one and being that salads aren't a part of their menu well then guess what that's not what I ordered.  I was really upset being that they really wasn't paying attention to me and now I'm super hunger and they were closed by the time I got home.  So I did complain to the company and I got an apology and that was about it.  Not a oh we are so sorry ma'am bring that food back and we will replace it or give you your money back nothing like that.  So I gave it a 1 star because you can't go any lower than that.  Believe it or not I really do like the food, but customer service should be just as great.  I will not go back. The customer service from the store and the appropiate people to get in contact with stink!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My sandwich was fine but the overall experience was horrid.   I ate in their dining room and by the time I left I had a headache from all the unnecessary noise.  When a customer walks through the door, in either direction, the whole staff yells at the customer, either \"HI\" or \"BYE.\"   I think the staff competes to see who can yell the loudest.   Trust me, the customer is not favorably impressed by this insincere gimmick.  The staff have to yell to be heard over the music that is blasting from the speakers.  This is beyond obnoxious and annoying!   What managerial moron thought that yelling at customers was a good idea?   You need to provide a pleasant customer experience, not an annoying experience.   Do you want repeat business?   Then stop alienating customers with this BS.  If I owned this store I would immediately turn down the volume of the music and stop this stupid practice of yelling at customers."}
{"text":"There are several Jimmy Johns downtown.  This is a new location.  It is fairly crowded at lunch.  Good variety of sandwiches to choose from on french bread.  Sides consist of Chips or Giant cookies.  I'm a fan of the JJ Gargantuan.  It consists of a little of everything.  It is huge!"}
{"text":"For a fast food-style sub, Jimmy John's is right on.  Great bread, simple fresh ingredients, super speedy service and ridiculously cheap--  $4.50 for an 8in sub??  I first thought they mischarged me!  Loud, cheery employees who bellow HELLLOOOOO to you upon entering.  Gargantuan scrumptious pickles for 99 cents."}
{"text":"Super delicious sandwiches and fast/great service. I wish the Turkey sub I ordered wasn't that skinny"}
{"text":"After an 18 hour day I needed to just be done so I ordered Jimmy John's always fast. Today was no exception so very fast but the bread was stale and they forgot my mayo and mustard. I'm not a psychopath I mean who eats a dry sandwich??? I called and the rep says oh um well I'm sorry I could have the driver come back with mayo and mustard, like I have the time or inclination to wait for that. No offer of any other restitution. What a let down a dry sandwich and well that's just enough I guess. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"I love me some Jimmy John's - this location however makes me want to punch kittens. It's like being in hallway - there's  no where to stand if you're waiting on a sub. Heaven forbid you ask for something \"on the side\"  - the gal behind the counter literally said \"I can't do anything on the side, there's nothing to put it in and Jimmy doesn't like stuff on the side.\" Jimmy? as in Jimmy John's Jimmy? Ya'll are personally acquainted. Give me a break. Pick another location if you have to have your JJ fix - or hit another sammy place."}
{"text":"This brand new location just opened behind Starbucks, Chipotle, GetGo, and next to Aldi in South Fayette.  It's kind of hard to see from the main road.  The food is typical for a Jimmy John's chain.  The subs are good for a quick meal.  The bathrooms have lots of funny signs on and in them (see photos) . . ."}
{"text":"This location is a little hard to find tucked into a a strip mall with construction in front of it. Though once you are in the door you are greeted immediately with \"Welcome to Jimmy John's\". Store is clean, staff is friendly and \"free smells\" are certainly welcoming.  Menu board is simple to navigate and questions are answered quickly and thoroughly.   But......I am on the fence about Jimmy John's. I really like the speed at which you get your order; they understand the true concept of healthy 'fast food'. I like the freshness of the meat and the cheese. The bread is where I get hung up, it's too chewy for me, I have to pull the sandwich away with a bit of strength to complete a bite, as my teeth can't even go all the way through the bread. Maybe if it was made a little crispy on the outside it may have a better result. Overall it a good sandwich, just not great. Though certainly beats Subway."}
{"text":"Fast friendly and tasty,  need i say more. They can handle the insane customer flow from residents, students, businesses and all the delivery orders. Haven't had a bad or slow order yet.  Try the beach club with hot peppers, it's my fave"}
{"text":"Freaky Fast Delivery? I don't think so! I am .8 miles away and it took 36 minutes. Driver said sorry we are really busy... management are you listening?"}
{"text":"I love that they put a Jimmy John's at this corner. Finally can have my #12 Turkey Beach Club without driving 15 minutes. Not to mention we now have another delivery option besides pizza, yippee!!  These guys make sandwiches super fast and the ingredients are consistent and flavorful.  I'd never put cucumber on a sandwich but it comes on my Beach Club and I wouldn't eat it any other way. It's in a vacant NE corner but I'm sure it'll fill in now that there is a staple here. The place is brand new and only been open for 2 days but there is still 6 people in back kicking butt making wiches!  Love it"}
{"text":"#12 beach club is great!  I cant believe I love a sandwich with cucumbers on it!?!  Its a turkey sandwich with cheese and avocado spread, the bread is fresh and the combination of flavors make this sandwich so great.  Service is good here, and the place looks pretty new and clean inside.  My daughter lives nearby so I hit this place up now every time I go to visit her which seems to be often since she is always in the need of money, furniture, food (I could go on...)"}
{"text":"The number 12 is the Beach Club turkey sandwich from heaven.  So glad they opened this location near my home so I am not driving so far when I get an urge for this sandwich.  I would never thought I would love cucumber on my sandwich let alone have a craving for a turkey sandwich all together.  This place is great!  This location is pretty small but most are.  They also deliver but I have never used this service.  Very casual, very friendly, and SUPER fast."}
{"text":"What's better than a JJs? One with a drive thru! My #6 The Veggie was delicious and the wheat bread perfect. Dill Pickle for only 20 cals on the side?, Yes please! This location did not disappoint with the food- though the drive through was a little less than \"freaky fast\"."}
{"text":"Great location, love that I can run in and run out for a quick number 9 (Italian) or 12 (turkey). The place is pretty new and super clean. Fast friendly service like all the rest oft he locations. Came here today at noon and they got me thru super fast. It is next to the Walgreens at the NW corner of 16 street & Glendale/Lincoln.  Great casual lunch stop when your in a rush."}
{"text":"Love the chain but this location frustrates me. Even when no other customers they are so rushed they don't get order right."}
{"text":"Such a bummer. Whoever took our order tonight was rude and hung up without saying goodbye. Then we got our food and the sprite was missing the syrup, so it was only soda water. Booooooo! Sandwich was good though!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwich spot. Super cheap and super fast like they advertise. Nice people every time my husband and I go in. It's really clean on the inside. Never busy when we go in. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is so addicting. I love their California club! I was staying over at the McKee family house which is literally right around the corner from jimmy johns. I went on a straight binge of jimmy johns sandwiches  for like a week. So good..Mmmmmm! Miss that place...   The pickles are huge addicting also. They have a nice variety of sandwiches and you can order whatever you want on it or off it. They have soups too... But I never tried em. I stuck to the sandwiches because it was what they did best!!"}
{"text":"I recommend ordering the beach club, but the past 2 times I ordered it there was little to no avocado spread.  There sandwiches basically consist of 2 pieces of meat and of bread.  I have tried the unwiches (no bread but wrapped in lettuce) and they are just A-OK.  I always see the delivery car around town, but have never had anything delivered.  I wish they had toasted sandwiches too."}
{"text":"1st timer. Subs are great but the menu was hard to read. Seating arrangement was odd."}
{"text":"With dine-in, delivery, and drive-through options there are so many ways to get your sandwiches freakishly fast."}
{"text":"I went in and was disappointed they didn't have any pita or wraps for sandwhiches, however, they do use lettuce wraps instead which was even more healthy so I was a fan.  The ordering of the sandwhich was awkward, it was my first time there so didn't know the process and/or ingredients.  The staff spoke so quietly and didn't seem to lead me in the right direction but I can't blame them exactly, it just seemed like a complete communication breakdown.  the wrap was good though and am excited as I travel to have a consistent sandwhich shop."}
{"text":"Nice place. Seems clean and decently kept but service. Service was an issue and not having any towels in the restroom it I will get over that. I like these franchise stores and they are always good sandwiches just, again service. Very disrespectful and on the cell phones at the register when I was standing there to order. Probably 15-20 seconds before he noticed I was looking at him ready to order. And then rude. Just rude and the others were not much better. Just didn't look like avert well run store and poor management today. Good sandwich though."}
{"text":"Speedy BUT the sandwich was so weak. Granted I just ordered Turkey Tom that's  very basic, I could not see anything  when I opened the wrapper... I opened the sandwich to see one layer of turkey meat, only a couple  slices of tomato, and little bit of lettuce. Disappointed..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite on our way to the movies.  Food was decent, but extremely overpriced.  Most likely due to the Tempe Marketplace location.  The customer service was rough!  After dealing with the people behind the counter, I was reminded that having a customer service based conversation with a teenager can be as pleasant as a kick in the teeth.  I don't see a return visit in my future."}
{"text":"Napkins nowhere and the staff was extremely rude and careless. Waited two straight minutes after sliding my card and had to ask if it went through and got an attitude and no receipt. Just, stay away. Couldn't find napkins anywhere and the staff never cared to offer napkins when it was obvious we were looking."}
{"text":"I waited years to try JJ's on the advice of my brother. I should have listened! They finally built one in Surprise 2.6 miles from my house but I am out of their delivery area. I order the \"Gargantuan\" sandwich which apparently they have a completely different definition of gargantuan than I do because the sandwich was smaller than any other sub shops regular sandwich. Next they only have 2 kinds of bread, I opted for the 7 grain which tasted old and took lots of water to choke down. Not going back, too many better places to get sandwiches from and they are happy to deliver to my house."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns Driver just cut me off on Baseline and  Southern in front of Superstition Springs Mall.. racing 60mph in a 40 in a hurry to get to the red light at the intersection I guess, did you really have to yell and scream obscenities at me.. should think about what you are doing if you are going to have a Jimmy Johns sign on top of your car.. Red Sports Car AZ Lic #  AYZ 7025... not going to order a sandwich from this place anytime soon.."}
{"text":"Fast delivery! My sandwich always comes fully packed. They always make sure you're satisfied with your order. I enjoy their large pickles and cookies as well. Friendly delivery employees and amazes me how they get my soda with a taped a lid to me without any spills. Their hot cherry peppers are not hot, but have the right amount of spice and I LOVE thier Jimmy Mustard. Great that you have the option to do French Bread, 9-grain wheat bread, or Unwich (lettuce wrap)."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is my second favorite sandwich place. In college, it was a go-to for late night runs and lunchtime meals. I've been missing it! Luckily, I now conveniently drive by the one on the regular. The drive-thru makes it ultra easy. I go during lunch hour and it's always still freaky fast (as they would say)."}
{"text":"After waiting 40 minutes for delivery, I GET STALE BREAD AND BROWNING LETTUCE?!    This location is ruining Jimmy John's reputation."}
{"text":"The sandwich artist were friendly, knowledgeable of the menu and quick with crafting a sandwich to my liking. I would definitely go back here. Thanks from the guys!"}
{"text":"I have to tell you that I have had a hit and miss experienced with this place. My expectations were very high the first time I ordered there (which was delivery, free delivery BTW). I had the big porker sandwich, kinda disappointing. Their deal here is that the bottom line price of the sandwiches is cheap, but then all the add-ons cost extra.  The second time I went, I must say my faith was restored. I ordered the gargantuan, which was totally hooked up the way it was presented on the menu. My tip would be that if you are going to go here, then actually go and sit down and eat, don't order delivery. Plus, ask the staff about all the add-ons. Usually they will be good about giving you tips on ordering so that adding extras doesn't cost you.  I actually thought the food was good, the sub roll was excellent, had a bit of a crisp crust (which is how I prefer Italian bread). I personally have other joints I prefer for a sandwich downtown instead of this place."}
{"text":"I've come to love Jimmy Johns over the last few months. The lunch here today was RIDICULOUS! Place was packed. Thank God I'm a genius and ordered and paid online. Parked the car, dropped a dime in the meter, in and out in 4 minutes. Booya.  Do yourself a favor and order online."}
{"text":"I stopped into this location and ordered a basic turkey sub. Upon getting to my destination I discovered they made me a wrap?? Sorry I'm not a wrap type at all. I called and spoke to the manager who was very helpful and apologized for the error. I asked if they would deliver me one since I basically wasted my lunch time going there and then waiting to get my sub. I'm not happy that I had to eat my lunch at my desk but the manager delivered it himself and was nice to deal with."}
{"text":"The service at this store is simply amazing! All of the employees are friendly and courteous! My order was filled correctly and as with all Jimmy John's the prices were fair! I will be coming to this store often for lunch!"}
{"text":"Moderately priced, decent sandwiches are found here. A few blocks away from UNLV, I'd rather walk here than wait forever at the Subway at the Union. I love their whole grain bread option because it has nice texture and taste. They do have a heavy hand using mayo, so if you're mayophobic, just tell them easy or no on the mayo. Service is incredibly quick and efficient, as it should. It's only sandwiches, not foie gras."}
{"text":"If you like more bread than meat in your sandwhich than maybe you'll like JJ's.  The sandwhich had big fat bread, but one super thin slice of meat, cheese so thin i couldn't find it or taste it.  The tomato slice was thick, too bad I asked for no tomato and got it anyway.  Black pepper was not available as an ingrediant nor are pickles.  Only a side pickle.  The sandwhich is small and  not worth the money.    If you want a good sandwhich,  go to Port o Subs where they slice and pile all the meat you want and paper thin sliced pickles are yummy."}
{"text":"They are VERY fast. Matt, Matt and Arena were fricken fast and so wonderful making my last minute party tray."}
{"text":"I usually go to the location by my house though stopped by here while dropping my friend off at campus. Of course it was lunch time and they were busy but they got through the line and had everyone's food made in a timely matter. Gabbi was on the register and she was extremely courteous towards all the customers. Low and behold Gabbi is also the manager of the store and while I was eating my sandwich, the number 11 which is my go to, I noticed how she  interacted with her employees and if they needed help or had questions Gabbi was there to help them. Heck the phone was ringing off the hook and they had a bunch of to-go orders as well as walk-ins and she went behind the counter and started to help make the sandwiches so the customer can have their food in a timely manner like they suspect from Jimmy John's. Gabbi even had to deal with an upset customer that said she ordered her sandwich with no tomatoes and extra cucumbers, which the customer DID NOT do when placing her order, but Gabbi eased into the situation, calmed the lady down, and made the customer happy. The level of dedication that Gabbi exhibits to help where ever she is needed shows in the attitude of her employees because they were a lot more cheerful, not going throigh the \"motions\" of work on auto pilot, the store was cleaner, and the overall attitude was far superior compared to the one by my house. Gabbi deserves the highest praise for how she runs her store and keeps it functioning."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns!!! It is one of my favorite sandwich places. Scratch that, it is my only favorite sandwich place. They are delecious! The staff of course is always very fast, if you are new to Jummy Johns prepare for a little anxiety when ordering lol."}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying I love, love, love Jimmy Johns......   This location is new but I am not sure that makes up for the mistakes. I work near this Jimmy Johns so I frequent it quite a bit. My boss sent me on this specific trip for lunch for him and myself. My usual is the number 16 Club Lulu no tomatoes (cant stand the taste of tomatoes). He text messaged me his order, Club with no onions. For those of you who are frequent Jimmy Johns goers you will know that half the menu is in fact multiple types of clubs. He has eaten at Jimmy Johns before so I assumed it was a club that had onions on it because he was specific about NO ONIONS! I gave them my order first because I knew it by heart and they began working on it while I discussed with the register man which club to get for my boss. He \"thinks\" the number 9 is the only one that automatically comes with onions so I went with that one. I explained my story how he didn't want onions so that has to be it. My sandwich was done before I even paid. I searched for my bosses sandwich because I went and grabbed drinks while the number 9 was being made. The guy making the sandwiches handed me two and I said no I have mine I just needed the number 9. He handed me someones number 10..... after the confusion and the proper sandwich I left with my subs. I returned to the office to find tomatoes on mine (even when you pick them off the taste is still there) and onions on his (even when you pick them off the taste and the SMELL is still there). We were both very unsatisfied with our sandwiches and now my boss will not be asking me to make the lunch run anymore. Fast is great but maybe waiting to listen what the custromer wants is better."}
{"text":"This Jimmy Johns is a little newer so I am gonna assume that is why they are not as fast. In the end the sandwich is still amazing and I love it. Club Lulu all the way. Don't get distrot about them having you order quickly, as soon as you get the system down you are thankful for such fast service because you don't want to wait forever for the deliciousness that it is!!!"}
{"text":"Havent ran into a bad Jimmy Johns yet!!! Love love love it!"}
{"text":"Umm their bread is good! Their peppers tasted like salt and the rest of the sandwich was eh but don't hold me to this I was kinda sick."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today, the cashier greeted me and I told him I've never been here before so I needed to look at the menu a little longer and he started explaining what they have (types of bread, lettuce wrap, etc). I didn't even think about a lettuce wrap so I said that sounds good, I told him I like the way the veggie one sounds but I wanted some meat in it, he suggested another sandwich and it was exactly what I was looking for. The food was ready so fast and tasted good for a sandwich place. Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Price+quality=amazing  I love how they use a slicer to slice meats there. The bread is amazing chewy how a sandwich should be. I want one right now.  The Italian dressing homemade is amazing ask for it."}
{"text":"This place used to be right smack in the center of my commute to and from work. Thus, I was here a lot! This place is dangerously good!  As far as I'm concerned, the Beach Club is the world's greatest sandwich. There's nothing wrong with it, they make it on the quick, and all the ingredients are top-notch and really, really, really good. They're so good that they make you question the quality of the sandwiches you get in other establishments, so you get spoiled.   I only ever get the Beach Club because I think it's perfect, though I've gone with other people who have ordered other options, as well. Nobody has ever complained about anything, and all the reviews I've gotten have been pretty dang good! The only consistent \"I just wish...\" comment about this place is that it's small inside. 10 people in here and this place is jammed and you'll have to \"excuse me, pardon me\" your way across the place. Not really a negative at all, but just so you know.   On my last trip here, I ordered 3 sandwiches and some drinks and stuff. I walked out spending $25, which is a great deal for the food you're getting. It's like fast food in terms that you get it quickly, but not fast food in terms of quality. This place is full of win."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's the way you love whatever it is you really love.   It was one of those situations where I left the grocery store and thought, \"well, I have all this food to cook later, but I gotta eat now!\" Enter JJs.   Seriously, the service at this particular JJs what exactly the way every place ought to be: quick, really friendly staff, and provided me with delicious food in minutes. I ordered the Beach Club, which I am convinced is one of the best sandwiches ever made (like The Bobbie). Everything about the sandwich screams quality: perfectly-baked bread, good amount of turkey, a good serving of avocado... and the vegetables were good, too.   I try to stay away from sandwich places because you never know what kind of ingredients they're using (the Subway lettuce, for example, is not the business). But with this place? None of that -- it's all good."}
{"text":"So I came here to get a sub and they couldn't figure out how to accept a credit card for the transaction. So the female server called someone over for help and the entire time I'm standing there she's looking at her Facebook and messages. In plain site where pretty much I can read the messages. Not professional , they need new employees that are over the age of 20"}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns. It's my favorite sandwich place and it's always great food (I especially love the #5 Vito) and everyone's always very cheerful, helpful and quick. The first time I went to a Jimmy Johns, I ordered and paid and as the cashier was handing back my change, another worker handed me my sandwich and said \"Sorry for the wait\". Haha, there was literally no wait at all. That's truly freaky fast! To me, Jimmy Johns is synonymous with tasty and fresh food, quick service and great employees. Every other Jimmy Johns I've gone to I would rate a full 5+ stars, but this location near Sams Club & Toys R Us on 56th Street gets 3 stars not because of the food, but because the employees are not real nice. Snobby cashiers and employees are not uncommon for fast food places in Ahwatukee, but these employees stand out simply because every other Jimmy Johns I've ever been to has almost over-the-top cheerful and nice employees. This location is near my home and I go regularly because it's so close but it's hit-or-miss every time with how the employees treat people. A few times I've come in when there's no other customers and all the employees will be sitting at a table together and I'll hear audible groans that one of them has to get up and help. So now, instead of the quick and cheerful service I'm accustomed to, I get the same person taking the order then making it. So \"freaky fast\" really only applies to delivery when you're the only customer. It's not a huge deal...but again, it's just very different than every other Jimmy Johns location I've been to. This location also gets frequented by a lot of cops. Almost every time I go in during lunchtime, there's a cop or two inside and I'll here Jimmy Johns employees say \"Thank you for your service\" and it's very nice. So last week, it's the end of a busy lunch hour and I'm already in line to order and I don't realize that 2 cops walk in behind me and they've moved off to the side and wait their turn. I'm up next and I start to order and the employee rolls his eyes, shakes his head and makes a big deal of walking from behind the counter, brushes past me and sticks out his hand to the cops, and in a loud voice proclaims \"THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE\" As he walks back past me to the register, in a much lower voice, he says \"Jerk\". I'm totally taken back. I had no idea there were cops behind me but obviously the employee felt I should let them go ahead of me and really got his digs in with me. I almost walked out because I didn't want this jerk making my sandwich, but he was just a cashier so I order anyway. He continues to shake his head and doesn't say one word to me other than the cost. I haven't been back to this location since. I drive 2 miles the other way and through mall traffic to go to the location north of the Chandler Mall. Luckily I have yet to had a bad experience at any other Jimmy Johns. Maybe it's just something about the manager and/or employees at the 56th Street location."}
{"text":"On the one hand they are freaky fast. Of all the restaurants that deliver to our house this is by far the fastest (but that might have something to do with being to closest as well). The sandwiches are pretty tasty when they get the order correct.  My main complaint with this location is accuracy. I almost always order the beach club and the only customization I make is no mayo and sometimes add mustard. Yet last time my sandwich came without tomato or cucumber. Two times before that there was no lettuce. Once I was sure they did not include guac only to find the smallest bit in between cheese slices on only one half of my sandwich. Ordering it cut in half is about a 50/50 chance it will come that way.  A restaurant that doesn't have a lot of customization options (no hot sandwiches, very few veggie options and two types of bread) should be able to get an order correct. Especially if they are charging almost $20 for two sandwich combos before delivery fee."}
{"text":"The best sandwich place! I love their sandwich! Always fresh and customer service are excellent. I don't have to wait forever for my order!"}
{"text":"Ordered a country club with extra cheese. Got a turkey and Swiss with nothing on it. No ham, no mayo, no extra lettuce and no extra cheese. Had already gotten back to the office when I discovered this. Only asked for no tomatoes."}
{"text":"It's a lot disappointing when they don't offer any suggestions.  I ordered a Hunter's Club thinking it would be on 9 grain bread. REAL Club sandwiches come on bread.  It came on a hard sub roll, hard as in when tapped on the table you could hear it.  When I inquired about the bread, I was told I had to ask for it.  No, I should have been asked which I preferred.  No offer to remake my sandwich.  No apologies either.   When I  asked what the topping choices were, the guy points to a sign.  I guess he can't offer up any assistance.  I asked if they had sprouts. His answer?  \"Nope!\"   I've never been to an eating establishment that didn't have salt and pepper.   Napkins are not given when your sandwich is done.  I guess everyone knows that you are just supposed to reach over the counter and get them yourself.  When I asked for them, the guy points to them, \"take as many as you need\".  Geeeze, don't go out of your way Skippy! Upon entering the \"restaurant\", there is a \"booth\" to the left.  However you can't sit there because it's used as a storage area.  Also upon entering, we noticed it was rather warm inside.  Three ladies noticed it too and left without ordering. We should have followed suit.  My first and last Jimmy John's experience.  Major fail.  Contacting corporate.  Not holding my breath."}
{"text":"I'll never go to this one again.  Twice I got mayonnaise on a veggie sandwich when I requested none.  This particular time they left off the guacamole and kept mayonnaise on.  I'm done here."}
{"text":"Just ordered lunch from this location today. Not impressed at all. I asked for extra lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers on my sandwich and lo and behold there was none!  The sandwich was all wrong too, somehow I ended up with a plain turkey instead of the one I ordered.   When I called to have it taken back or my card refunded some boy answered the phone and told me it was correct and they were not going to refund me so stop calling. Are you kidding me?!?! Never again."}
{"text":"The sandwich I ordered was great! But it took 42 minutes for them to deliver the sandwich 9 blocks, even after I tipped over 50%.."}
{"text":"If this review was solely from my fiance, he'd give it more than 5 stars if he could.  Coming from someone who likes their food hot, I don't like Jimmy Johns anymore. We actually used to order it alot and I used to like it! There was one experience where we ordered delivery and they honestly come very very fast. but that one time, my fiance said he saw the guy running around the apt buildings because he couldn't find us. I mean honestly, it wasn't that hard to find us. And the wait was almost an hour long. It was ridiculous.  The last time I've eaten here was probably in 2011. I was sick that week, and the sandwich just didn't taste good at all. I cannot stand cold sandwiches, and it's pretty dumb they don't offer hot as an option. Their menu also doesn't have alot of choices if you're kind of a picky eater. I surely won't order from them again."}
{"text":"my girlfriend had a modeling shoot nearby. she also used to work at one of these places back in her hometown (in California, not Nevada) and consistently talks about the sandwiches, so decided to give this chain a go, and i liked it."}
{"text":"Never been here, food is freaky fast like the commercial says. I had the roast beef sandwich can't recall the number, I did like it. It's a tad pricier than other sandwich shops. Customer service was good. I'd be back."}
{"text":"Upon entering the store we were yelled at by at a minim of 8 employees all standing behind the counter as if they were waiting for customers.  There were not any other customers in the restaurant when we arrived at 1:04 PM.   We ordered our food, spent 26.65 for two sandwiches, two waters, two cookies and 1 bag of chips.  We went to sit down only to find every single table was dirty, food all over them.  I asked if I could have a towel or something to wipe the table off.  This young girl comes out starts cleaning the tables she cleans the one in front of us, the one in the corner then the trash can, starts to walk past when I ask if she will clean ours.  She sprays it down and then wipes it off.  I then ask her if it is their practice to clean the tables with \"Windex\" as this is what she was using.  She stated this is what the manager tells them to us.  I then explain to her that there isn't any disinfecting qualities in \"Windex\" I asked if the manager was there, she said yes he was in the back.  I asked to see the manager.  We had our entire lunch, sat there for 45 minutes, the manager never came out.  I have ordered online from this same store in the past and have received poor service then as well, they delivered my food without all the items and then stated they couldn't refund the items they didn't deliver.    This is the worst Jimmy Johns, I'll never order or eat at this location.  Poor management."}
{"text":"Well i ordered delivery today. About a hour after i ordered i decided to check my bank just to make sure i ordered the food. They charged my credit card.. Proceeded to call Jimmy Johns to get a status on my order. Apparently they tried to contact me(no missed call or voicemail) and there systems are down and couldn't process my online order. Yet the person i spoke with was able to read me my order and address. Way to drop the ball and offer some bs to cover it up. If you had told me the truth i would of been OK. . The food was generally good but will never order from this location again."}
{"text":"I moved back to Phoenix less than a year ago, and in the 5 years I was gone Jimmy John's seemed to sprout up everywhere. I never tried it when I came back to visit, and when I moved back it took me awhile to finally stop in one. Well, I've now been to this location a few times and I like it.   Honestly, when I first stopped in I wasn't all that impressed. Not by the taste of the subs themselves, but I didn't realize the menu here is pretty limited. There really isn't all that much to choose from. The toppings are pretty limited, and they ONLY have provolone cheese & white bread. That being said if you're gonna have limited options do it well, and Jimmy John's does. I would normally never order a sandwich on a white bread roll, but the ones here always taste soft & fresh. The sandwiches are also cheap, and the service is fast (like, REALLY fast). I'm not kidding when I say your order is ready almost immediately after you finish giving it."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good, fresh and fast however when you have customers sitting outside to enjoy the beautiful weather don't come and smoke right next to them. Rude and disgusting! Employees should not be allowed to smoke out front!!"}
{"text":"I l o v e coming to this Jimmy John's! The one on Durango is closer to me, but every time I come to this location, I leave in a better mood than I come in. I'm not sure if it's because I'm finally about to eat or the customer service, but I'm not complaining. Everyone, that I've seen, is in a good mood and seems to enjoy working there. Also, their chocolate chips cookies are SO GOOD! The oatmeal ones have a pleasant hint of cinnamon, but I can never resist getting the chocolate chip one when I'm here, especially with them looking at me as I order lol   Bottom line: upbeat service, delicious cookies and great sandwiches. I will definitely return"}
{"text":"If ordered between 12-1pm the delivery person will apologize for not being freakin fast and say they don't have very many drivers.  Any other part of the day and these guys delivery the subs as fast as it would take for me to get to their store. They are freaky fast. Food is always correct."}
{"text":"I heard great things about JJ's sandwiches. So I took a gamble and phoned in a Italian night club sandwich with hit cherry peppers with no mayo. The sandwich did not disappoint. It was tasty, the Italian sauce was tasty. I like the French bread, it was firm but soft inside. Price was 5.75 for a good size sandwich."}
{"text":"Two stars is generous.  The place is clean and the service has been good.  I cant figure out why people like this  place.  The subs are not good.  I've tried at least five different kinds and they just are not good.  They are not bad....just not good.  They have no real taste.  If you ask them to go heavy on the mayo, they are better."}
{"text":"I was told that they were super quick even when it's busy. I was a little skeptical because I only had about 15 min to get back to work so I went anyways.  As I parked in the busy parking lot, I saw a car next to me park an 4 guys came out and I was like \"I need to get out of my car and seriously run to the door to be next in line!\". Of course I didn't do that cuz I didn't want to make a fool out of myself.  The place is small kind of reminds me of the setup of wingstop on rainbow and twain.  There were probably 6 people I front of me but in no time I was ready to order.  I ordered the 'Turkey Tom' it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Went in with my family. We had never been here before. Nobody greeted us, we just stood there reading the sandwiches. When we ordered we stood at the register where there were two employees talking to themselves. I even had to say I was ready to order. Ordered. Had to ask for napkins. The third employee was even bothered that we had asked. We just felt like such an inconvenience. The sandwich was actually ok but there was NO customer service."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  The ingredients are all fresh and the multi grain bread is good. I thought it was a little on the pricey side considering the multi grain bread makes it more like a sandwich than a sub."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if Jimmy John's has always skimped on the avocados, but I went here and got a veggie sub, which advertised avocado as one of their main ingredients.  After a few bites of my sub, I couldn't taste any avocado so I peeled open the sub and peered inside.  I couldn't find any avocado looking stuff in there whatsoever.  So, I went to the counter to ask the sandwich maker to put some avocado in it.  He explained that they put the avocado paste in between the cheese, and they measure out 1 tsp each.  1 tsp each?  This sub is the same price with the same veggie ingredients as a meaty sub, but they can't put in more avocado?  The sub itself tasted OK, but I was just miffed at their parsimonious ways, since you can hardly taste anything in just 1 tsp of veggie ingredient.  It seems like they just add avocado to the sub just so it sounds better on the billboard ingredient list, and then skimp on the ingredient to save money."}
{"text":"Every Jimmy John's will get you generally the same quality food, but at this location, these guys are FAST!  It's like they psychically read what you're thinking.  We always joke that your order goes like this:  Me: \"I would like a.. \" Employee: \"HereYouGo\" (Sandwich handed to you before you finish your sentence)"}
{"text":"Very fast preparation. Ordered the sandwich and it was ready by the time I made it down the counter. Regular subs are $4.25 for about 6\". Loved the crushed ice in the soda machine. Right on the end of Tempe Marketplace next to D'Arcy McGee. The bread didn't blow my skirt up; a little stiffer than subway, but fresh.  I ordered the #5: Vito. Basic Italian sub. Good choice. Few seating options might be the drawback. Room for 10; otherwise it's carry out"}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's but never tried it before my son, who is only six years old, wanted to go there specifically for sandwich. This is the same child that would only eat mac & cheese or chicken nuggets and french fries... So, needless to say we went there. He ate his ENTIRE sandwich (Slim 1 | ham & cheese, plain) and LOVED IT! My twins, who are a bit younger shared a Slim 1. I think that not having the lettuce and other condiments actually worked out better because my kids are just going to eat the meat and cheese anyways. But for me, I chose the Vito (which is the #5, I believe), with no tomatoes or onions. I know my sandwich was absolutely delicious and always is!  Having my kids actually want to eat something other than McDonald's chicken nuggets is really great. We have not changed our order since our first visit, except to add an additional sandwich now that my twins are bigger, and also so they can each have their own sandwich. Any unfinished sandwich is good for a day, maybe more, but my children eat it with in that day if kept in the refrigerator. Although I'm not sure how I would like my sandwich as a leftover simply because it has lettuce and other condiments that could make it soggy, unlike the \"Slim\" sandwiches. It's been nearly 2 years and we still love going there!!  I admit that I am a frequent visitor because of how close this location is to Target. And I just love Target! I've always had excellent customer service and would highly recommend trying if you have not already!"}
{"text":"By far the best JJ I have ever been in.  The owners were very nice and the crew was enthusiastic.  The subs are always great.  Keep up the freaky fastness."}
{"text":"JJ doesn't have an answer for a plain sandwich with mustard and cheese. Probably the most pathetic sandwich I have ever seen. Counted 4 thin slices of turkey and thin slices of cheese as we were searching for the mustard. I had a #9 and still have a after taste 30.mknutes later. First time and not a fan. I'll take Togo's and Jersey Mike's any day of the week for quality and dollar for dollar spend."}
{"text":"I have never been inside the actual Resturant, but the delivery is out of this world.  I swear, they often deleiver it BEFORE I finish ordering online.  Okay, so it's not that quick, but pretty fast.  It could be because I work almost right behind them, but still, it is awesomely fast.  And it's Good.  Much better than other sub shops.  And the sandwhiches are BIG as well.  IF you order a pickle, make sure you get it in quarters, as the whole one won't fit in your mouth!  Crunchy chips, tasty bread and meat.  What's not to like?  Oh, did I mention they have very quick deleivery?"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero star, I would! We ordered from this location at least once a week if not more and have consisitantly had horrible service. Not freaky fast, usually freaky slow or freaky NO! I have had 1.)No food delivered or a call 2.)consistantly late food and one time that they didnt bother to call and when I called them I got the usual excuse, \"we are short staffed, or the delivery driver got lost at the last delivery and its made it slow\". If they had at least called , I would have had time to come by and get it myself. So this time, I thought, I'll just go pick it up and cut out the middle man. I went into the store and ordered my food. While eating, I noticed that one employee was working while the other was chatting up HER friends who were hanging out in the front booth. Meanwhile, bossing the new guy around as to where sweep up. The worst though, was her friend started coughing like she was choking,(all fake) and started making this vomiting sound very loudly while the others stood around laughing. She went on for a good 5 min while I sat in a booth trying to refrain from actually vomiting from the discusting sound. I am appauled by this poorly run location. Sometimes you have a rough day or a bad apple but you have to make an concerted effort to be as consistantly horrible as this location!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever but in giving 3 stars for the customer service today. People at the register extremely friendly and nice. I actually know a couple of people that work there.  Whoever was working the end of the line today was rude and had an attitude. It was busy in there and loud.he called out a order but I couldn't hear very well partially because it was loud and partially because I have lost 40 % of my hearing due to surgeries. I simply asked \" did you say two number fours? \"  His response with an annoyed look was \" Dijon mustard add avocado??????\"  I responded yes and that I was sorry I couldn't hear him very well. I then asked if he had a bag and said yes and pointed to the bags behind the counter. I was guessing he was insinuating that I need to grab it myself so I reached over the counter and grabbed one and left.  Not sure what his deal was but I felt like he was trying to make me feel stupid and like I was being an inconvenience .  Love the good but wasn't too happy with the service today"}
{"text":"This location is very fast when it comes to their customer service! They do not pressure you to make a decision or to add any crazy extras, such as chips and drinks. Even though the sandwiches are composed of 4-6 ingredients they still ask you if there is anything you would like to remove even if you didn't ask. I always leave with a smile!"}
{"text":"1st I'd like to say, for the handful of times I've ordered from Jimmy Johns, the quality for the price- is not worth it..     My biggest gripe though, is with this location in particular.  I drive through this parking lot about 4x a month and every time I am almost plowed into by a Jimmy Johns driver, who drives RIDICULOUSLY fast, to maintain their \"speedy fast delivery\" slogan.   I'm sorry but speedy fast delivery for crappy subs is not worth the jeopardy of mine and my children's safety.  Slow down!!"}
{"text":"I called this location today to place a order and I have ordered from this location previously from my coworkers phones . They tell me since they don't have my number logged in there system, there unable to take my order for delivery and proceeds to tell me they don't deliver to this location . Mind you me and my coworkers have ordered and had deliveries to this location before . I am truly disappointed in there customer service and I will NOT be ordered from this location ever again!"}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time. When my sub came it had things I didn't ask for on it and was just lacking flavor all together. The tomatoes were chalky and I was charged for cheese?? Is it normal for subs to not come with cheese? I didn't ask for extra. I also asked them to go super easy on the meat, \"like one slice\" and because I got two types of meat they charged me $2 extra dollars without informing me of this. And they didn't go easy on the meat. Anyway, the sub just wasn't good and since it costs me over $9 I went up and asked for a refund because i figured for $9+ I should be satisfied with my food. The first person I talked to said that should be fine but when I got to the cashier he said he wouldn't give me a refund he would only make me a new one. I didn't want a new one, after again asking for a refund and again being rudely and unapologetically told no, I got a plain baguette. I left so annoyed and frustrated that the company is obviously not training their employees the importance of customer satisfaction. Needless to say we will not ever be returning to jimmy johns."}
{"text":"JJ's just opened here in Old Town yesterday.  I stopped by during lunch (just a quick walk across the street) to grab some grub.  My first visit EVER to a JJ's.  I was surprised - Fast (like SUPER FAST), cheap, and decent proportions.    I'll be back!  :)"}
{"text":"First time ever to a Jimmy Johns and I tell you I'm super stoked we stopped to eat here. Super clean place and very friendly staff. The sandwiches are great and affordable. I had the Hunter Club and the wife had the Italian Night Club, we could only eat half which was good because we ate the other half on the road home."}
{"text":"I would avoid ordering for delivery, I'm less than a mile away from this location and over the past month it's taken over 30 minutes each time from the time my sandwich leaves until I receive it. This last order was delivered an hour after the app said my sandwich was made. No surprise the sandwich is soggy and drink completely flat. It would be much faster to go there and eat then get delivery.  I don't think they have the staff to support the deliveries volume especially since the last delivery person left on one of those rented bicycles. I also called to check on the order and I wasn't upset, just curious as to what was going on. I was told it was out for delivery and not offered an explanation even after I informed them this has been an ongoing issue."}
{"text":"Service is always quick and pleasant.  Sandwich quality is inconsistent from visit to visit.  Quality seems to depend upon who is working.  Music can be a bit loud but that's normal for most all Jimmy Johns restaurants."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! J/J let us down. For one, they took 40 min to deliver and they are 5 min away from hour house. You can get a pizza delivered faster than that!!! Then they made our order incorrect. Booo!!"}
{"text":"The \"unwich\" is what makes me a fan here.  I love sandwiches wrapped in lettuce.  You can turn any sandwich into an unwich on the menu.  So lets talk about the service, or more like the \"Jimmy John's attitude\" as I like to call it.  Every business has a vibe.  I have been to three different Jimmy John's and one of them was in a different city, yet the vibe was the same.    I liken it to the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld.  They know they make a good sandwich and have a menu above your head, so you figure it out, order it and it will be out to you soon.  There is no friendly chit chat and no warm and fuzzies, but they aren't rude. It is just a certain attitude that has become what I consider the Jimmy John experience.  I appreciate that and I love the unwich.  I am a regular."}
{"text":"well, that was fast! my sandwich was made before i even finished paying.  The bread wasn't anything to write home about.    The whole experience was simple, fast, and easy."}
{"text":"We've been several times, it started out great I love the vegetarian sub, much better then Subway! In the last couple of visits quality and service have both gone to nothing.  I'm really sick of annoying restaurants skimping on veggies when you order a vegetarian something.  I'm guessing they don't skimp on ham if you order a ham sandwich!  Not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Dumb policy, loss of customer.  I was a frequent customer of this JJs.  So frequent that I took the time to set up an online account with all my personal information, including credit card.  When ever I got hungry at work I could just go online and order my favorite sandwhich which was made just as I had \"built it\" online and it would be ready and paid for when I walked over to pick it up.  But for some reason they implemented a $25 minimum for pick up orders.  This would make sense for delivery, but for pick up?  Customer service could not give any reason for this policy which is as dumb, and much more inconvenient, than their policy of not having plain old salt and pepper.  I've found other places to order online, but I do miss having JJ's as an option.  Update from Jimmy Johns: Ben, I apologize, but we do not plan on changing our policy at this time.

{"text":"BEST SUBS IN THE VALLEY. so delicious, always super fast and very friendly. never dissapointed."}
{"text":"Always a good, clean, fun place to grab a quick sandwich. Nothing fancy here but amazingly fast!! get some!"}
{"text":"Does Flash Gordon work here? Their sandwiches were ready in a nano-second, alright, scratch that. It probably took about a minute or 2 but that was still faster than any sandwich place I've ever been to. My galpal and I were in quite a rush to get back home because we had some errands to do and were debating really quick whether to try out the firehouse subs or this. When she told me they're known for their speed, I did not hesitate to jump on the bandwagon.   Here I ordered a Turkey Tom for my mother. We were brought into this vintage diners restaurant and a sweet aroma of deli deliciousness. It cost me roughly $5 which wasn't bad at all. According to my mother, the sandwich was pretty filling, too much mayonaise though so if any of you are watching your diet, better request to have a tad bit of mayo scraped off. Overall, the quality was good, service was fast and workers were accomodating. Will definitely come back to check out their Totally Tuna sandwich next time, per my galpal's recommendation!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time in downtown Phoenix.  Was going to have a turkey sandwich but the turkey looked disgusting!  Then opted for the tuna which tasted terrible and ultimately made me sick!!! Will NEVER eat there again!"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's subs are fresh, and they taste great!  If you have not tried them you must stop in.  This is my third time to this location and I have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I needed lunch in 15 minutes or less and I ordered, stuffed my face with a Turkey Tom, and was on my way back to the office in 10 minutes.  Freaky Fast indeed."}
{"text":"Jimmy John, where have you been all my life?!  I'm not a fan of chain subs.  Subway ruined subs for me a long time ago.  THIS IS NOT SUBWAY!!!!  Thank God.  This is REAL, fresh sliced meats and cheeses, fresh baked breads, crispy fresh lettuce and veggies.  Those are SMILES on the faces behind the counter, folks!    My favorite?  The Unwich.  My favorite Unwich?  Anything with the avocado spread.  And real turkey!  And bacon.    This location is clean, bright, fresh and stylish!  Look for the seating in the back with windows looking out into the marble interior of the Union Trust Building.  Nice spot to enjoy the best chain sub in town.    Thanks, Jimmy John....you've restored my faith in fast food!"}
{"text":"Super friendly and freaky fast that isn't a gut bomb!  For me this is a contractors lunch of choice!"}
{"text":"No complaints here.  Great subs and predictable.  Typical customer service for a college kid run business.  FAST sub in my mouth!"}
{"text":"Ordered a vegetarian Menu describes it comin w avocado spread Not drop to b found No whole rolls Just bare min Iceberg lettuce White tomatoes On ehite roll Nuthin gourmet about it Dont bother"}
{"text":"In my mind, there's a certain status symbol your city gets when you get a Jimmy John's! Overall, as a sandwich shop, JJ is the bomb! Great bread...and toppings like sprouts and avocado tickle my fancy! However, my recommendation is that, if you not sure what you want or are in a pickle timewise please use the JJ app. You can customize your sub to your preference for an even faster checkout especially if you're a picky eater like me. If you go during lunch hours and the parking lot is full, no worries mon...there is parking in the back. I haven't met an unfriendly staff member and they always get my order right!"}
{"text":"Blonde day dreaming as I placed order. I said excuse me did I loose you? She giggled????!! Ordered a #3 not so hot.. Deer valley location better!!"}
{"text":"This Jimmy Johns is awesome! Same great subs like all the other locations and this one even has a drive thru!!!!"}
{"text":"The good, the sandwich is fresh and good.  The problem, I ordered the Vito tonight and it took 25 minutes for delivery. I live 3 blocks away!!  NOT freaky fast!  The real problem though is the attitude of the people who answer their phones.  I had placed my order on line.  After 20 minutes, I called to be sure the order was received.  The person on the phone was so rude! All he said was it's on its way.  I had not even given him my name! So, I asked, for whom?  He said my name I said yes, he repeated it's on its way.  He never said thank you for your order, I don't even think he said good bye when he hung up.  Now, I have ordered form this store many times, and honestly this is ALWAYS how the phone person is  and for this reason I am giving 2 stars.  If management sees this and gives a crap, which they may not, it was 4:00 on 3/9/2017 if you want to know the employee with rude manners and lack of understanding of customer service!"}
{"text":"Fast and tasty subs.  The customer service is great."}
{"text":"Lousy service.  They don't pay their employees a livable wage.  Just raised their prices.  Cost me $13.00 for a sandwich combo.  When I received it, barely anything on it, including not much on the meat and cheese.  I returned the food for not being satisfied.  They put their hands without gloves on my returned sandwich.  I left.  Recap, no ingredients to a sandwich that cost $13.00.  never again.  BTW, THEY DIDN'T REFUND MY MONEY."}
{"text":"After hearing so many people rave about this place I had to go in and see what all the fuss was about. I ordered a country club sub and I was not impressed. The sandwich was mediocre at best, overloaded with mayo- I think I could have tossed together a better sandwich at home. The bread was too thick, I had to pick a lot of it off just to get to the meat. I would possibly consider trying another sandwich sometime but my first experience with Jimmy Johns doesnt leave me wanting to go back or suggest it to someone else."}
{"text":"Get lunch here at least once a week.  In and out in 5 minutes, even in rush hour, back to my hotel, grab a quick nap, back to work.  Vito !!"}
{"text":"Got a turkey wrap. Mostly smothered in Mayo with a small slice of Turkey. Could have bought half pound of Turkey and Bread at the same price."}
{"text":"I order from this location often and have it delivered to me.  I haven't been inside of the restaurant but each time I've received my order pretty fast.  The delivery people have always been very polite and professional when they drop off my order and the food has been delicious and well made each time.  There are other people at my work who order from this location often too and the delivery people are always nice when they're dropping off those orders as well.  I've had a good experience every time I've ordered from this Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"I don't know why people like this chain. Pre sliced preservative meat. It's on par w subway. If you want a real sub go to jersey mikes or dibellas."}
{"text":"I usually order here because it's close to my work. We usually order delivery but on more the one occasion, they have made mistakes ok our orders. I decided this time to make a pick up order and I ordered a #14. I go and pick up the sandwich. When I got back to work, I noticed that instead of the sandwich being roast beef and turkey, they made a roast beef and ham sandwich, which doesn't even exist on the menu. Couldn't go back to get it fixed because I was on my lunch break."}
{"text":"Today I celebrated National Turkey Lover's Day with a Beach Club turkey sandwich in Jimmy John's. It is ironic that turkey which is associated with Thanksgiving falls on Father's Day. Considering that my dad lives all the way up in New York and the Beach Club sub lives down the street, I would visit Jimmy John's.      This marks the very first time that I stepped foot in a Jimmy John's. Going back to our 2013 Seattle vacation, where Jimmy John's had been everywhere, it remained a mental bookmark. It would take National Turkey Lover's Day to erase the bookmark.      In the shadow of Sunset Station at the southeast corner of Sunset and Stephanie next to Five Guys Burgers, I parked my car near a Jimmy John's delivery car. Apparently they deliver. And apparently they have a vast menu.     When I walked inside the long and skinny eatery, there was the large menu on the wall. I appreciated that it was out of the way of customers waiting in line and employees at the counter waiting on me to decide. At Jimmy John's, the customer orders by number. The numbers 1 to 6 correspond to an 8 inch sub where the numbers 7 to 17 correspond to a giant sub with twice the meat served on thick sliced grain bread.      The order process is a breeze. Every sub features their own ingredients. Disparate from a Subway, the customer doesn't pick each ingredient. This expedited the process. After ordering and paying, I poured myself a Coke from the Coke machine, and relaxed before they called my sandwich out.     While waiting, I noticed two types of seating. There were booth seats and high tables with stool chairs. On the walls, I took in the Jimmy John's sense of humor. One picture joked, \"If these walls could talk, there would be no need for signs.\" Another joke was, \"Your mouth isn't watering, it's crying for Jimmy John's.\"     What was not a joke rested on my table: The Beach Club. There between the two slices of thick sliced grain bread was the slices of turkey breast. There were two outer layers of the delectable slices of turkey breast framing overflowing lettuce, avocado spread, sliced cucumbers, and mayo. Tomatoes and provolone cheese complimented the Beach Club. This was one colossal and filling sub. There was absolutely zero need for a side such as a pickle, Jimmy John's chips, or a chocolate chip cookie.      The $8.64 I exchanged for the sub ($6.50)and medium Coke ($1.49) was well worth the money. On the Las Vegas Strip $6.50 falls short of the price for a Starbuck's Frappuccino.      I am satisfied that I finally tried Jimmy John's Subs. All it took was my 2016 National Calendar Day 25 Review Challenge to get my foot inside Jimmy John's. After trying their Beach Club, my foot will be back inside a Jimmy John's Sub shop sometime in the future."}
{"text":"This location is the bees knees! I've been coming to this location about 2-3 days a week and they haven't disappointed me! Sandwich was given to me right after I paid (even when I added and subtracted several things on the sandwich)! Plus, the staff is always super excited to be there and happy from what it seems. Keep it up guys! You know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I admit...I'm biased. Many years ago, in college, I worked at a Jimmy John's (not this one). But, compared to your usual sub joint, JJ's is not that bad at all. They are actually pretty darn good.  The bread, while shipped to the stores frozen, is baked constantly throughout the day, and is far better than the likes of Subway or Quiznos. The meat is sliced throughout the day (I know because I did it), and the tuna is made daily. The pickles are awesome, and are worth the extra 75 cents or whatever the hell they charge. I can't rightfully suggest a JJ's over a good local spot, but if you want something good, and you want it quick, JJ's is just fine. Honest. I would not suggest a place that was dirty or otherwise lame. I worked at one for six months and will still gladly stop at any JJ's I come across...if you have worked in food service before you know that means something.   As far as this location goes, I have no complaints, other than that Dave's is right across the street and may be more worthy of your money. But if you are home in the area, and really...hungry but not in the mood to leave the house, call JJ's.  Oh yea...the big secret is \"yesterday's bread\"...gross, right? No...you can get a loaf of bread from the night before for around 75 cents (same as a pickle? Curse you, fickle memory), but if you are on a strict budget (like any real college student not coasting on daddy's money), it can go a long way with a little PB&J (so long as you toast it). They don't really advertise this, but it'll be on the counter when you walk in."}
{"text":"I never eat in the establishment, but they have great, fast delivery.  The subs are worth my time to eat!"}
{"text":"Hey if you actually love JJ's then this one is probably one of the best locations around. From what I can tell, service is good, timely, polite and \"freaky fast\" for all intents and purposes. This restaurant is also very clean. And I thoroughly enjoyed the \"facts about Uranus\" on the bathroom floor in front of the toilet. The wall is also lined with various \"types of urinators\". (Check me on that word - I donno if it's real but I'm using it.)  However, despite the above I just find Jimmy John's rather boring. I think they like to keep things as absolutely simple as possible. If you're even a mild foodie you won't be particularly interested. They have the option to turn any sandwich into a lettuce wrap, which I got on my most recent visit. It's definitely a good low calorie alternative. All they really sell is sandwiches. That's their thing. And unlike Subway for example, there isn't a lot of room for customization. When compared to other niche market food places (say Domino's) they also don't branch out much (into wings, etc.). Lastly I don't care much for the fact that of the usually 2-4 ingredients per sandwich, mayo is always one. Yes I know I can say \"no mayo\". Side note for the side items, the crunchy salt and vinegar chips are the bomb. In conclusion though, Jimmy John's never is and never will be on the top of my list of fast food or sandwich joint choices."}
{"text":"Firstly, I really do love Jimmy Johns and their sandwiches. The problem is, if you cat actually get one, then what is the point of patronizing the joint. I usually stop in once a week as I have errands to run over there on a regular basis. This is the third time in the last 6 months or so that they are out of bread at between 1 and 1:30 in the afternoon. I wonder how many times they have actually run out. I know the bread is baked fresh, but they can't plan that poorly, can they?  If its a case of them only baking so many loafs for a day and when they are out, thy are out, I'm fine with that. All I ask is that you tell me. That way if I have meetings schedule that will put me there when you don't have bread I can plan accordingly. Not that it will do any good, but I'm going to have to not patronize this JJ and maybe all for the next 60 days as that is truly my only voice.  Maybe they'll miss my money, maybe they won't. I hope the situation is that business is so good they just can't keep up with demand and my non-patronage is a non-factor. Maybe it was the perceived lack of sincerity or maybe had they offered a free or half-off sub the next time I came in. Maybe I'm just having a less than stellar day, although I did make every green light on the way to work today and that was the indicator I things to come. Who knows, but I really wanted a JJ sub today and settled for Carls Jr.which just didn't cut it."}
{"text":"Love the roll, meat us very good, and you can add oil, vinegar, spices etc. However, for the love of god will you PLEASE get regular dill pickle chips for the sandwiches.  I know you can get a whole kosher pickle, but I like the dark green dills!  The hunter club and the porker are my favs."}
{"text":"Not really a big sub person but thankful it's open so late at night after the dining hall closes. Fresh vegetables and decent sandwiches."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and not once have I ever had to wait more than 5 minutes from ordering to walking out. If you're looking for a quick easy meal this is a good option. Food quality is what we've all come to expect from JJs, not spectacular, not bad. I've yet to have a negative experience here. Employees are mostly all pleasant and clean, as is the restaurant itself. I enjoy the funny signs all over the walls."}
{"text":"Oh man... I am writing about Jimmy Johns...not that I am too good to do so but because what is there to say?? It's a dang sandwich chain. Well, I am actually writing this because the fact that you can get sandwich/sub as an \"unwich\" is an awesome offering. Its like a really fresh huge hand-held salad. I am a fan and now will frequent for this particualr reason. Thank you Jimmy Johns!! Great idea, good, healthy and fresh :)"}
{"text":"My best friend took me here a few weeks ago and I was quite pleased. It is EXTREMELY clean and organized. The menu is kind of plain and there aren't many options but what they have is great! There weren't many other people in there but as a group got up to leave, the manager came out and personally spoke with them, ensuring they were pleased with their experience. He then wished them a good rest of the day and they left. Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and great prices. Open late and deliver. Strongly recommend to anyone in the area"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, fast service, price is good. What more do you want in a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Love this place. We work in the same shopping center at the dog supply store. We order out every day and everytime we order from them the driver or is always very friendly and in a good mood. Will continue to order from them"}
{"text":"GIANT Pickles! Just ask... about a buck fiddy and cut into fourths..  Now that we got that out of the way... Jimmy Johns is tasty, pretty much everything I have tried (and add hot peppers!) and the crew is fast! Dare I say Freaky Fast? Ok, I won't"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab lunch after a doctor appointment and headed back to work. Plenty of staff at the ready. Place my order and by the time I filled my soda, the sandwich was ready.  Love the un-which (lettuce wrap) and the wheat bread the most!  If they were to create a tag line it should read: \"Freaky Fast!\".... Wait, what?"}
{"text":"Plus: -Yummy sandwich! I got the #5 Vito. Your typical Italian (but also my fave!). -FREAKISHLY fast preparation.  -Crushed ice in the soda fountain. -CHERRY COKE in the soda fountain! -Inexpensive. -Did I mention it was super duper fast?  However... Minus:  -Can't get pickles on your sandwich. They can sell you a whole one, though. -The bread is just okay. Not my fav. Prefer Subway or Togo's. -Pretty small menu. If you're looking for something 'different', don't go here. -For the size of the sandwiches, they have a GAZILLION calories. Not a good place to go if you're dieting unless you don't plan on eating much else that day. Skip the chips!"}
{"text":"They're quickest but they're not the best JJ's at following instructions. Hoping that changes soon!"}
{"text":"I had been waiting to go on my lunch break and to finally eat the lunch i ordered from Jimmy Johns. Horrible! Meat falling out, wilted lettuce. How embarassing!"}
{"text":"The california sub is delicious!! Avocado!!!!!!! Thick delicious avocado!!!! So good!"}
{"text":"This had to be the worst place in Scottsdale. They didn't even have napkins. Never again."}
{"text":"This store is awful! They first delivered me someone else's food and when they corrected it they got our order wrong"}
{"text":"On a normal day, I don't know that I would give Jimmy John's four stars (sorry Jake!).  Then again, their service might have been better on a normal day.  On this day, however, they were handing out free subs.  That's right.  FREE SUBS.  Though the line was not as long as it gets for, say, free ice cream at Ben & Jerry's or even pizza at Donato's, it was a pretty good one.  Perhaps most importantly was that the line moved rather quickly, even though the location is on the small side and ti was crammed with all these people craving a free sandwich.  While the line did not illustrate that the Jimmy John's staff are lightning-fast at their jobs at making sandwiches, it can be understood in this case.  The only real problem is that because of that line, the directions for anything other than your sandwich were left a bit nebulous.  Want a cookie?  Oh, you should have picked that up at the register... move back three spaces and fight for it with the people now at the register.  But once the process is done, enjoying some sandwich goodness works out well enough!"}
{"text":"Spent $21 on 3 subs and the owner said he was unable to give me a side of hot peppers? I thought he was joking, but he then explained he has no way to up charge for the peppers, so I had to get some on the sub or none at all. I offered to pay for the side of peppers, he refused.  I am still in disbelief....  Never going back. Every other sub restaurant in America will gladly give you a side of hot peppers.  Horrible service, horrible location. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"After a grueling day of work and productivity I finally had time to nourish myself and with all the choices one has available to them in this great country, I chose to consume some Jimmy John's. An admirable choice, or so I thought. After all, I have had food from this establishment before and the pride that they have in regards to customer service and the expedited delivery of their sandwiches led me to entrust them with my nutritional needs. I could not be more dissatisfied with the order I placed today. They say patience is a virtue and boy did I have to hold fast to mine tonight. With my stomach making noises that were almost deafening, the delivery man finally arrived with my order just shy of an hour after placing it. He genuinely apologized for the delay and I sympathized with the man. They were very busy, just as I had been all day. The let down came when I began to open one of the two Hunter's Club sandwiches that I had ordered. Having waited for such a length of time to consume a full 1/4 pound of fresh sliced medium rare roast beef combined with provolone and lettuce I was shocked and in disbelief at the quantity of fresh sliced medium rare roast beef that I laid my eyes upon. The sandwiches both had two and a half slices of fresh sliced medium rare roast beef that barely weighed in at 1/8 of a pound. My eyes began to sweat in disbelief over my order and my heart sank low after the good reputation of Jimmy John's within took a hit. I'm not here to request a refund or anything like that. I just want the employees of this company to know that they have dropped the ball on one of their long time advocates tonight. Sincerely and sadly and still hungrily yours, a sandwich consumer."}
{"text":"Stopping to dine at JJ's for lunch today further cemented the idea I had all along that many people who Yelp about restaurants in Vegas are on meth...... I'm not sure what is \"Gourmet\" about their sandwiches, but mine was far from gourmet. It was far from Subway for that matter.... First off.... they don't serve hot sandwiches, only cold. Sweet. Secondly.... I asked for something like a turkey club and they served me a 6 inch sub with lettuce, mayo, turkey, tomatoes and bacon. That's it. When I was ordering, I told the woman at the register that it was my first time here and I was hoping to have something that would bring me back.... She was deaf apparently. The bacon was so weak that Subway bacon would've turned its nose up at it.... It was barely cooked and half raw. They gave me 2 thin slices of turkey for every 4 inches of sub. The turkey wasn't roasted, baked or offered any flavor whatsoever. It was grocery store bought turkey, slattered with mayo on a sub roll. The roll wasn't bad, but far from Gourmet. The restaurant was clean and painted very fun, but it didn't get close to making up for my crappy sandwich.  I gave it two stars because it's almost impossible to mess up a turkey sandwich, and although they didn't mess it up, they did leave a lot of be desired.  Bottom line.... I won't be back and you should keep heading up the road for another place to eat."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of J.J. and am thrilled that this little shop has opened here. Their quality  is great and I bought 4 sandwiches and was out the door in a flash."}
{"text":"Anytime I order from this location they forget something. I also always ask for extra veggies and never receive them. But it's close and convenient when I'm too tired to cook. Plus the veggies, meat and bread are always fresh. I won't be ordering from this location again as it has become a total waste of money."}
{"text":"First time to this location...Saturday 2:00ish... pleasant young staff... very efficient ordered 3 #9s add pickles... brought them home... super fresh bread, perfectly made... will definitely go back to this location even though it's further!"}
{"text":"Another visit, another great sandwich. They're getting an updated review because the fountain drinks were funky tasting. Also I was told I could order just a half pickle, they gave me a whole one. And their Skinny Chips...bleech, won't buy those again.   Still for speed of service and a great sandwich, along with service with a smile means even though they messed up they still keep their 4 stars."}
{"text":"I called here for a to go order. I didn't have any issues and I was there in 5 mins and my sub was ready. I checked out quickly and went on my way. My sub was yummy! Delicious toppings and I love their bread!"}
{"text":"I came here for a to go order. We had no issues ordering. I usually get the french bread and decided to get the wheat bread. It was ok. I would definitely stick with the french bread. The wheat bread was so thick. We loved our subs and the service was good."}
{"text":"Jimmy john's is usually great, but at this location it was disappointing. I ordered a tuna sandwich and there was one drop of tuna. My other two friends also had mistakes with their sandwiches. I think they should slow down and pay attention to the online order otherwise we won't waste our money here anymore."}
{"text":"We were running late so I scrapped my existing plans for a nice lunch and looked around for something quick to eat. I saw this restaurant, subsequently learning it was part of a large chain. After looking over the menu, my wife and I decided to share an Vito submarine - 3 micro thin slices of cold cuts, a similarly skinny piece or 2 of cheese, tomato slices and shredded iceberg lettuce in a skinny, taste challenging roll that made for one pitiful sandwich. The only reason I might return to Jimmy John's is to the men's john."}
{"text":"Brand new $3 delivery charge?!  The sandwich used to just cost $1 more for delivery (it was reflected in the sandwich price).  The drivers get pennies of this new charge and the rest goes to health insurance for the employees.  Why do I have to pay for their health insurance AND tip because I ordered delivery? A $5 sandwich goes up to $11 for a $3 charge and $3 tip?  I don't want to screw the delivery driver over because that is not fair either.  This location also does not have sprouts...just saying...greedy and cheap.  No more Jimmys for me at this location! Overall though....the food is amazing here and at any other location....better with sprouts though.  Shame too, I used to go here frequently (only delivered a couple times).    Update: I have wanted a JJ three times in the last week, it is so convenient here at the university.  Not buying again till the charge is removed.  I will drive to the other Charlotte locations for my JJ fixes."}
{"text":"Order placed at 950. 1030 rolls around with no contact made. Turns out they \"ran out of bread\" when we called asking what was going on. The attitude we received was unlike anything I've had from Jimmy Johns in all the times I've gone there. When asked for the name of the person we were talking to, we got a laugh and \"ocean tide\".  Not only will we not be eating at Jimmy Johns again, I will not be using them to cater the events I throw for work on a weekly basis. I'm sure Jersey Mikes or even Subway (ugh) can fill the void.   I understand things happen, but the complete lack of accountability, dismissal of concerns, zero effort put forth to contact us, and the attitude and lack of a single \"sorry\" was super lame."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place ever!!!! Fresh food, extremely fast service!!! The guys who work here should be very proud of themselves for representing a brand with only the best !!!!! I only wish other restaurants would get training from these guys, some people have a lot to learn because of the example these guys set.. For sure only the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Normally I have a great experience, but tonight the girl was so rude! She slammed things down was short with her responses and just complained about her job very loudly to everyone. I think it's time for someone else to find a new job if you don't understand customer service."}
{"text":"Great value. I went for their #1, the ham and cheese sub. For a quick-serve place, this sandwich was tops. Mind you, it's no mom and pop sub shop, but if you are on lunch break, and need to eat quickly and deliciously, this is the place for you. Make sure you do go through your topping options, or else you only get lettuce and tomato with a little mayo.  This chain is still not anywhere near Jersey Mike's type quality and flavor, but it's a good place for a quick lunch, especially when you are pressed for time. The one by the courthouse must be a money printing machine... It's faster preparation than Subway, at a similar price and quality of ingredients.  I'd go back if I were in the area and needed a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Fast and tasty - that's pretty much what they advertise. They lived up to that expectation today. We were at the Frick, checking out the place, but could not get into the Cafe, so we needed something to tide us all over while we waited for a tour. The Frick Park Market is closed until January 5, so that wasn't an option. We did a nearby search on Yelp to look for places we could get a small bite that wasn't a burger joint, and voila!  We asked them to make a 15 piece party platter, and it was done in less than three minutes, and was well made and delicious. No, it's not a foodie paradise, but sometimes you just need decent food quickly - this is the place. Much fresher tasting than the leading sub sandwich competitor, where the options are so many and end up looking wilted and stale mid-afternoon.  Yep - we liked it. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite at all. If you have the choice go to subway. Im pretty sure they put a whole jar of mayo THAT WASN'T EVEN GOOD on my sandwich. Not going back. Team subway!! ;)"}
{"text":"I don't really \"get\" Jimmy Johns. I have some friends who would give their first born for a sub from this place, but I just think it's alright.   Anyways, after a hike up in Scottsdale, the boy and I stopped by here for a quick lunch on the way home. It was around noon so it was pretty busy, but of course we got our order taken pretty quickly and received our subs shortly after. We both got the bootlegger club and they were both really good. I have to say though, the layout of the restaurant is really awkward, as in where the soda fountain is what feels like inches away from a booth and is in the middle of the seating area so it was really crowded with people getting their subs/getting sodas/going to sit in the back.   BUT, I have to say that for the price, JJs is a really good deal. $5 for a huge sub that definitely filled me up."}
{"text":"The meat and veggies proportion were on spot, the bread was lousy.  To make a killer sub, try a new bread for the submarine bun.  Seriously no flavor and it was hard (not crusty).  Super fast delivery and no extra charge for that which is a plus.  I might try it again, but probably won't because of the bread."}
{"text":"Went in and ordered two sandwhichces while waiting someone on the line cut through their glove and said owww. Didn't change gloves,check hands, Or wash hands. Continued to make everyone's food. No way I was going to eat it  waste of $15"}
{"text":"Plain, no taste whatsoever food, with grumpy old woman serving in the counter. Winning combination for everyone who want to waste money for nothing"}
{"text":"Oh my god  I came in here with my Nanny We walked in for the first time and felt uncomfortable  Bunch of young kids looking at US like we didn't belong there.  Asking us what we wanted, we asked for a minute, to look at their menu.  Got the food.  Sat and my nanny said \"do you like this place?\" I said \"absolutely not, they are rude and I can't believe we came here.\" Dumped it and left.  It opened 2.5 years ago My whole neighbourhood wasn't happy about it, so we opt for capriottis  Location and parking is good  Located near my house in Las Vegas.  Shops nearby."}
{"text":"First time visit to Jimmy John's and it was a deliciousness of an experience. They lacked a little customer service. We didn't see a manager on premises. I'm sure the customer service would have been better if a manager was over seeing the place. The restaurant looked extremely clean and organized. We will be back..."}
{"text":"Here right now for lunch after watching some baseball at the Reds stadium down the street. Got a number 5 and asked for my peppers on the side but I was told that this is against corporate rules....... ???? I've been to plenty of jimmy johns before and never had a problem. Moral of the story is if you want peppers on the side, don't go here. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The team is always so nice in there! Everyone is smiling. It seems like a great place to work. Also the sandwiches are great too! The bread is always so fresh and the veggies are crisp and taste how veggies should taste not like they have been in a refrigerator for 3 weeks like some sub places.  This time my aunt and I went in and the guy at the register was so nice and funny. I know it is just a sub place but they are making the world better a little at a time :) This was 5/9/17 about 545pm"}
{"text":"I love their freaky fast delivery!!! However,  they forgot the cheese and mustard packets. ..I wanted to give 5 stars...but they only get 3. Five Stars for Jimmy John's!!!  I called to let them know about the error and the next yummy sandwich is on them. Great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I went to grab a to go order. The #2 big john. They got my sandwich order correct and made it quickly. I ordered a lg fountain drink but the employee handed me a small. They made me bag my own order and were rude when I asked where the cup lids were."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is one of my very favorite things in life. But being a long time Henderson local, I have been consistently disappointed in this location. No matter what time I come in, there seems to about a dozen teenagers working. These kids don't know anything about how Jimmy Johns does business. Twice now, I've ordered my favorite sandwich, #2 with the freebies. Both times, they have added peppers. This would NEVER happen at the other LV locations. Also annoying, last time I came in, they informed me they didn't have punch cards yet, but they happily stamped my card from another LV location. Today, they told me they don't have a stamper, even after I explained last time I came, I got a stamp. Step your game up, JJ!"}
{"text":"I came here to get my wife a quick sub to eat for her while she was on lunch. I asked for a Beach Club and I was charged a beach club. My wife tested me and told me that their was no meat at all. I looked up on the menu and the beach club has turkey and etc. I called the store and spoke to Zach and he said they would fix it for me. I arrive at the store around 6pm and they \"manager\" (cough)cough) told me they could not do nothing about what happened. They basically started a full blown argument with me. I showed them my receipt and still nothing was done. When I asked for a coperate number I was told to Google the number. I asked for names and they all stayed quiet. I will NEVER come here or eat at any Jimmy John's ever. I the people here were rude, obnoxious and didn't care about my problem."}
{"text":"JJ's is a pretty well known chain and in my opinion, the better alternative to the Quizno's and Subways of the world. The sandwiches just taste fresher, are made quickly, and are pretty cheap. This place has both delivery and a drive thru so you can get your sandwiches quick no matter which way you want them."}
{"text":"I used to eat at the original Jimmy John's in Charleston IL. Jimmy John's is probably not my favorite sub sandwich...but it is a very good sandwich. The thing that they are great at is delivery. Fast and cheap!!!"}
{"text":"Joke!!! Never again...should have read reviews first. Can't hear or understand girl at the counter. 15 minutes for the wrong order of three sandwiches. No reason to eat this stuff if it's not convenient."}
{"text":"Today really made my day. I was having a rough start with a sick toddler and Hector used his one manager meal on me. It was very thoughtful and made this pregnant mama's day, thank you!!"}
{"text":"They are fairly quick, so thats always a plus for lunch. Their sandwich is pretty standard and theres nothing really special about it. The bread is pretty soft.   They don't cut the sandwich either which is kinda weird. It's just one long sub."}
{"text":"4 miles away.  and they dont deliver here.   fail"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Jimmy John's location if you're in the area. Very fast service as expected when you dine in.   I ordered delivery recently and it usually takes about 11 to 15 minutes; however, this past order took 35 minutes  and the sandwich (Beach Club) looked as if somebody stepped on it, unfortunately. Everything fresh as usual and here's hoping it was just a fluke. Just saying."}
{"text":"The fact that I can put \"no ice in drink please\" in the DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS with an online order and never receive ice says a lot. Especially when you consider every time I have ever ordered at McDonald's I look someone in the eye and say \"no onions please\" and almost always get onions. It's the simple things in life that goes a long way."}
{"text":"A sandwich shop with- Warren Buffet's quotes on walls? Really? WTF????  My first- but not last- foray into Steelyard Common's Jimmy John's.  Located around the corner from Target, and right next to Great Clips hair shearing, where previously shaggy guys walk out with perfectly coiffed mullets.  Two lovely tables outside in the blinding light.  One side features a view of mounds of broken concrete, the other showcases the freeway, and a cellphone tower.  The interior has some obligatory americana tchotchkes, with, seriously, Warren Buffet's investing tips on the walls.  I'm not too sure what to make of this.  Perhaps they are reaching out to their target market.  The 2 young ladies behind the counter were very helpful in guiding us through the menu.  Everything behind the line looked nice, fresh and wholesome.  It was pretty good too.  I had an Italian sub, the gf had a tuna salad sub.  Both were WAY better than anything from Subway.   Yeah, I'd go back.  -If only for the investment strategy tips.  And a decent sandwich too.   Carry on."}
{"text":"And here we are again, Jimmy John's.    Almost an hour wait for sandwich delivery less than a mile away.  When I called I was told \"Well, it's not 'freaky fast delivery\" anymore, it's just freaky fast sandwiches.\"     No empathy, just excuses.    If you're not \"freaky fast\" delivery anymore, how about maybe giving an estimated delivery time to your customers?      NEVER  WILL I EVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN."}
{"text":"It's amazing how fast this place makes sandwiches! You order, you pay, and right when you're putting your card or change away, bam! \"#5 ready!\" I usually order the Vito sandwich, an Italian sub filled with deli meat, lettuce, tomato, and provolone cheese. It should also come with Italian vinaigrette which was missing in my order this time around. Their sandwiches are okay, nothing fancy. You really go here for the quick service and cheap price."}
{"text":"I'm that annoying customer with food allergies and restrictions, but Peter was so patient and helpful!!! Made me feel welcomed and told me all my options... Thank you Peter!"}
{"text":"I order Jimmy Johns often, because they have great sandwiches (Vito!).   But this JJ's delivery time is Absouletly Awful. It seems to be a driver problem, because sometimes I order nothing more than a couple cookies from them (which are pre-packaged in store). And I kid you not-- the cookies will not be at my door until 30 minutes have passed, every time. I understand that there are other deliveries the driver has to make before my own, but not only do I live less than a quarter mile away from their store, but the deliveries from them are consistently late.     *** Update Review*** (4/17/17)  I ordered my Vito and Cookie at 5:19 pm. It is currently 5:59 pm. I called and was told the delivery driver is on his way.   I don't know why I keep ordering from here. It's like getting back together with an Ex. If I wanted to wait about 40 minutes for my food, I would have ordered a pizza!!  *Update to the update: My order arrived at 6:07 pm. Talk about anticipation. To his credit, the delivery biker was a friendly guy."}
{"text":"This Jimmy John's replaced the Worst Chipotle in the Universe, so now, for roughly the price that used to get you lukewarm and poorly prepared Mexican food delivered with a sullen attitude, you can receive a pleasant sandwich served swiftly, with a smile and a cookie.  JJ's is roughly what would happen if Warren Buffet read Douglas Adams' Mostly Harmless -- the one with the sandwiches and the Perfectly Normal Beasts -- and decided that herein lay the future of putting meat between two pieces of bread. The chain decor cannot quite decide if it's preparing guests for their MBAs with plaques of how-to-succeed advice or if it's trying to be funky and in-joke-y and hipster. Your concentration is better devoted to your sandwich.  An 8\" sandwich runs in the neighborhood of $5, or a bit under $9 with a drink and your choice of chips, pickle, or large cookie. So it's not quite as cheap as Subway, but it's a lot better. Take the bread. JJ's bread is not a spongy substance that can be mistaken for a yoga mat. It's more like a fresh bolillo or perhaps an elongated kaiser roll. It tastes like actual bakery bread. The meat, similarly, tastes like deli meat, not like meat you'd pick up from the refrigerator section of the dollar store. The portions are not huge, but they're in line with what you'd get at very similar Potbelly or from an $8.50 deli sandwich (no drink, no chips, no pickle, no cookie) from AJ's. Since the meat's just as good as the AJ's sandwich and the bread's better, I'd go with JJ's over AJ's.  The cookie also is comparable to AJ's cookies from the bins, but larger. It's not the greatest cookie you'll ever eat in your life, but it's better than many of the cookies at the Paradise Bakery next door.  Service is so fast that my sandwich, completed and wrapped, hit the counter while I was still deciding on my cookie.  So essentially, a JJ's sandwich will not be a life-changing New York deli experience, but the place is staffed by hoopy froods who know where their towels are, and you can count on its being mostly harmless."}
{"text":"Went back today as I feel every place deserves a second chance. I was again irritated that the smallest sub I could order was an 8\".  Also I verified on the VITO there is no mention of mayo on the menu,   it states it is served with Italian vinaigrette. I made sure to mention it to the girl behind the counter and she told me they put mayo on all their subs. I will not be back."}
{"text":"i have always liked jimmy johns but for some reason every time i eat at this location i always get sick, so i dont think ill be eating here any more."}
{"text":"Worst delivery.  Gave them my direct line and they never called me, asked for any other info they might need.  They did listen as to what entrance to go to and that is why I give them 2 instead of 1.  The good sat for 20 mins and I just think their sandwiches are mediocre to begin with.  If you are in this area, hit up the Lunch Box for a great sandwich and they deliver.  Way better food."}
{"text":"Never actually set foot in this location, but order at least once a month from here.  Always friendly drivers and quick delivery.  One time we ordered online and the 3 sandwiches were at our door in 12 minutes, we are 1.3 miles from this location. The staff here are always friendly."}
{"text":"Don't go here! Yes they are known for \"quick service\" and that is about the only pro Jimmy John's has going for itself.   They are very strict on how they will make your sandwich, one you are PAYING for, and they wont listen to what you want.   Example was I wanted one of their sandwiches that comes with salami, capicolla,and ham.. Being allergic to ham I requested to have turkey subbed out... I was then told \"sorry we can not do substitutions\"... When I explained the reasoning one of the employee's said \"well we can not put ham on it, but we will have to charge you $2 for turkey\"... To which of course was like well where's my discount for taking off the ham? And they said that this was how it's done and no alterations are allowed.  Now I can understand if i'm asking to add turkey on top of everything else, or if I asked for double meat... Yes charge me extra... But for them to be so rude about this, I would much rather go a little farther to Jersey Mikes where they happily help me with no issues with my allergies."}

{"text":"They finally opened up a Jimmy Johns close to me. I love it that they deliver...:-) I will never eat subway again after eating here...."}
{"text":"I ordered my Vito sandwich for delivery. I placed it on the app. It came 30 minutes later. They forgot my chips, didn't bring me a straw for my drink and gave me one napkin. Literally one napkin. This was my first and last time ordering from the infamous 'Jimmy John's' I will stick with firehouse or subway. I am terribly disappointed. One star for the sandwich which was surprisingly good.   SERIOUSLY READ FROM THE OTHER REVIEWS....THE REPUTATION FOLLOWS"}
{"text":"Super fast service; delivery took 10 minutes from order to front door. Good sandwiches, great price!"}
{"text":"The commercials are no joke! These guys are fast! The sandwiches are delicious, the employees there are friendly and keep the restaurant pretty clean. I had just finished swiping my debit card when BAAM my sandwiches were ready! The fact that they are so fast doesn't mean your sandwich will be wrong or lacking ingredients! Oh and yes, they are really yummy!"}
{"text":"Always stellar service, best sandwich in Vegas!  Prices are unbeatable, well-kept and clean enviroment!"}
{"text":"I was blown away by my experience at this Jimmy John's.  The staff was BEYOND LAZY, sitting on the counter arguing over who would assist me.  I was the only person in the restaurant when a young girl (apprx 16 years old) came in and dropped off an application.  The staff then, in front of me, read over her application, made a few sexual jokes and discussed where she lived.  Sorry, but the sandwich will not make up for that!"}
{"text":"GOOD This place is FAST...I mean really fast.   If you want to grab a sandwich on the go or want to sit down and grab a quick bite. This is my current go to spot for a good sandwich at lunch.   The service is friendly and I have never experienced what the \"scorned\" casual past reviewers had experienced...and I've been here plenty of times to base my review on good service each of the times I've been here.  Tables and decor are clean and up modern...not much wear n tear like some sandwich shops Ive been in...  BAD Would've given a 5 star to this place but came in one time this month....it smelled like somebody used a dirty mop on the floor.  I blame a lazy employee and not the business as a whole for this one time occurence.  Other than that...kudos to the JJ's team for always greeting me with a smile and having  a great sandwich made fresh for my belly!!"}
{"text":"I know Jimmy John's is all about \"super freaky fast\" service, but their manners are also pretty freaky.  I'm usually sympathetic to unmotivated or cranky employees (after all, there's nothing glamorous about working at a fast food place).  Unfortunately, the college kids who work here are particularly resentful--and they don't mind taking it out on your sandwich.  I came in by myself to pick up dinner for friends.  When I tried to place my order, the girl working the register (who was obviously new) struggled to punch in each item.  No one seemed interested in helping her, even though 4 other people stood behind the counter.  She finally started yelling at them...still, they just stared blankly at the cold cuts in front of them (maybe they were stoned?).    After they made and wrapped my subs, they placed them on the counter in front of me.  I asked if they could bag them since it would be awkward to carry all those sandwiches on my own.  One employee pointed to a stack of paper bags and told me I could bag them myself, if I wanted.  The sandwiches are all just variations on a theme: meat of choice, watery mayo, tomatoes, a modest smear of avocado, and too much shredded iceberg lettuce.  The taste is much improved if you add their tasty hot peppers, but I very rarely crave a Jimmy John's sandwich.  For fast food sandwiches, I vote Subway.  The only benefit of Jimmy John's is that they deliver."}
{"text":"This location opened not too long ago. We've had sandwiches delivered a half a dozen times at least and were happy to see this location getting on their feet. The delivery was fast and we rewarded it with more than generous tips. Now I guess they have their customer base built and no longer need us because, even though they recognized our address from our phone number and acknowledged that they had delivered to us before, we are suddenly out of their delivery range and they refuse to deliver to us now. Great way to build customer loyalty and to stand by those that helped bring you up. Even if it's necessary to limit your delivery area, a little flexibility to grandfather in your existing loyal customers might have been a better approach.  I wont even stop there for take out now."}
{"text":"A haiku for Jimmy John's...  Turkey Tom I love, Sandwich so tasty and fresh, A happy belly.  Enjoy, friends and park carefully in those meters!"}
{"text":"I'm so bummed! Today's order is not only NOT freaky fast, but it's freaky rude. After exactly 30 min, I called to check the status of my order and there were two girls going back and forth, \"LIKE, he left LIKE 10 min ago and has 4 deliveries before you.\" K, got it. Thanks for the customer service. THEN, my order was wrong when it DID arrive. **This May have been my fault as it was an online order.** but when I called, THEY WERE B's again!! My experience was \"yikes!\""}
{"text":"I eat at Jimmy John's every once in a while when I'm on campus.  I'm so glad they opened one closer to my house! Apparently they've been at this location for a while, but I found out the other day. Better late than never.  The wait at Jimmy John's by UNLV is not very long, but when I came to this location, there was no one.  I sat down and my sandwich was ready.  The guys that were there were really friendly as they greeted me when I walked in.    I ordered the #6-Vegetarian and I love that sandwich! For having no meat, it tastes really good and has flavor.  There's provolone cheese, sliced cucumber, lettuce tomato, mayo and some avocado spread.  I believe it was white bread, but next time I will order it on wheat.  But it was still good.   Looks like not very many people know this place is here, so inside is super clean and organized.  The location is great, right by the Galleria Mall.  Although I will be fighting my taste buds between here and Chipotle."}
{"text":"Like the previous reviewer, I work just a stone's throw away so I also wanted to like this as a regular spot.  The first time I went I got the Vito, a basic italian sub, which was alright, the bread a lil hard on the end. Next time I had the california club; turkey, avo, sprouts, tomato, lettuce, cucumber, mayo. It was pretty good, flavorful and filling. Today I got the same thing on their wheat bread amd it wasnt as good. Firstly, they forgot my sprouts(!), then i was eating the end of the tomato (the yuck end) and my cucumbers tasted unfresh. They seemed like they were frozen before, all flexy and slimish. Wasn't feelin it at all. The bread is good though. The place is clean and they are extremely fast with like 10 dudes making sandwiches. I can't help but think the quality goes down because they are trying to be so quick. The prices are good though, just please get some quality control."}
{"text":"Update! I stopped patronizing Jimmy John's when I learned my debit card was compromised in their data breach. I miss their sandwiches but I can't have my life shit down for extra meat on a sandwich."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER. They asked me for my PIN number to two of my cards!!! And didn't know how to charge it as credit. I was waiting at the drive they window for 20 mins! Freaky fast service... my ass. As I leave the drive thru I realize they had given me the wrong order and one of my sandwiches was missing. I love Jimmy Johns but I will NEVER go back to this location! Horrible horrible horrible service. I wish I could give it zero stars."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best bread and \"freaky fast\" service. Can't go wrong for around 5 bucks."}
{"text":"Says open till 1am. They close early. Wouldn't recommend wasting your time showing up if it's after midnight-super frustrating."}
{"text":"Looking at the reviews, I know what the problem is here.  Yeah, not coming back.  Been to many JJ's and this is the worst I go to .  Will spend my dollars somewhere else.  I showed up when the MGR, (a really personality dead individual) was counting out the drawer.  He told me I had to wait.  But the Sandwich maker said, what are you having, I will get it going.  (5 stars with this guy)  He made my sandwich and wrapped it up.  As He put the tape on it I asked him to cut it in half.  He started to unwrap and I said, no worries, just cut through the paper and rewwrap it.  No big deal from me.  As soon as he cut through the paper, the manager, who had 3 people waiting in line, stops helping his customers, turns, points, and yells, dont ever do that again.  I was stunned he would yell like that, and the Sandwich maker says, what?  The MGR yells again, and louder, dont ever cut through the paper again, if paper gets in the sandwich, then we have to remake it. Now I started to tell him that I I asked for that to be done, but this brain dead individual would have nothing of it.  He is one of those domineering managers who is my way or the highway.  I told the SM guy that I was sorry, and he says, I have to go through this all the time.  I have owned businesses and run businesses and there is a time and a place to talk to your employees.  Never is it to stop what you are doing and yell at someone in front of the whole store.  I will eat next door, or down the street, but not here again.  Lots of 1 stars on this restaurant, I would lay doughnuts to dollars that they started about the time this guy was hired.  Find another job buddy, you are not a manager and do not need to be the face of a customer service based company."}
{"text":"Dear Jimmy Johns,  Love the food, hate the guy answering the phone for delivery.  If you are mad at the world and do not give a  s^%T about how you project yourself to your customers like you don't care that we have a million choices in the sandwich arena and we chose you, then you my friend have found the right job cause you are an expert.  You answered the phone at 130 pm on May 24.  Good luck cause that was the worst phone service I have ever gotten from a Jimmy John's ever."}
{"text":"OMG I LOVE YOU JIMMY JOHNS. YOUR SUBS ARE SO MEATY. and fairly priced. The guys that work at Jimmy John's are pretty cute, to boot. They are SO FAST, too! The Gargantuan is my absolute favorite! It's gigantic! I've had it with, and without bacon, and I gotta say, it's better without the bacon.  Bread is always fresh, flavorful, and perfectly baked."}
{"text":"I like it here, I get the Beach, whateve the one is with the avacado, maybe its the California. I like the tuna also, its always pretty quick I guess because they seem to have like 15 people working there behind the counter. They dont come out and wipe off the tables though so there is always junk and smudgie marks from people's mayonaisse hands etc and wadded up napkins all over the place. Its kids working there so they are not really into cleaning or \"extra work\", but its quick to run in on lunch hour and I like their bread too."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positives.  I like this place because they are fast, which is their reputation. I've ordered both online, in person, and for delivery. However, every time I order something, they don't put enough meat in it and its very lop-sided inside the sub. I have to redistribute the meat myself every time. My husband like the italian night club and #5... I like #2."}
{"text":"This Jimmy John's really is fast in general and compared to others. The employees were also so kind and professional!"}
{"text":"I got off of work and was in the mood for a great sub sandwich.  I got on the JJ app and ordered and headed home.  I live about 5 minutes from my work and JJ showed up right after I did.  Talk about fast food!  I was able to enjoy a nice meal without dealing with the dishes or people out in restaurants.  The delivery capability they offer is great for someone like me who work 12+hrs a day.  I'll make sure to keep my app and meal saved for the next time I need an emergency dinner!!"}
{"text":"I went to have lunch here for the 2nd time ever, my first experience was a great one we went to the one on Lake mead in old Henderson. The guy that took our order was quite pleasant,  he forgot to charge me for the salami I added so I had to pay 2x though,  and did not receive a receipt.  When I went to get my sandwich,  I was confused because I didn't know which one it was because I didn't have a receipt and didn't want to touch someone else's sandwich. The girls who made the sandwich were very rude and told me \"this one is the salami one! \" although my friend and I both added salami to our sandwiches  (one was hers one was mine). When I read the paper on the sandwich it said dijon mustard and I did not order dijon I ordered yellow mustard.  When I told the lady that I ordered yellow mustard not dijon she did nothing except tell me all we get is packets,  even though the menu clearly states yellow mustard.  She didn't even offer me mustard I had to sit down then go ask for mustard and all she gave me was 3. I had to have my friend go ask for me because I was scared to ask for more. They gave 2. One of the sandwich artists proceeded to come out to the lobby and get a drink,  look at me and laugh.  Shorter, younger girl with brown hair. My sandwich was not cut, and it's impossible to get napkins at this location with the caddy girls who apparently only know how to stare you down instead of actually offering you anything.  I am friends with the owner of Jimmy Johns in North town,  and I'm pretty certain Brian would not be happy to hear about my  experience I had here. I won't be back, atleast not at this location."}
{"text":"This location has a drive-thru! That's really all you need to know. I didn't even know there were JJ's that existed with a window.   This is the perfect option at this exit if you don't feel like eating greasy fast food or getting out of your car. I stumbled on it by accident. Just drive past the sushi place next door and around to the back side of the building.   It's a Jimmy John's, so you pretty much know what to expect here. The wait wasn't too long to get my food after I ordered and the cashier still apologized for the delay. You got to love that JJ's speedy mentality."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's radio commercials are super corny, but they always make me giggle.  This location is super convenient for those who work uptown. Not so much, though, if you have to drive here during the day.  The roomies and I popped in here this week to grab some sandwiches. Holy line out the door and down the sidewalk. And holy wow this place is teeny tiny. Lunch crowd line moves super quick, though. I always get my usual: the Italian Night Club. I can't ever remember what it's called... so I usually call it the Italian Nigh Job. Pretty sure that's something wayyyy different. No matter what you call it... add the hot peppers to it.  Doing a pool day at the Avenue, Trademark or Catalyst? They deliver. You're welcome in advance. Need a place to get your grub on with your JJ's sammie? Walk on over to Romare Bearden."}
{"text":"The Big Italian had so much mayo that the lettuce and tomato were limp. Selected this sandwich for vinegar and oil, not mayo. Had to throw the bun away."}
{"text":"I've had sandwiches from JJ's twice, and they were just OK.  The tuna sandwich was very bland, and definitely needs some 'kick'.  They need to add more lemon, mayo, pepper, onions, dill, etc.  That said, the breads taste fresh, and the service here is fast.  I'll probably come back and try another type of sandwich, but for now, my favorite 'go to' place for great subs and wraps is 'Jersey Mikes'.  That place is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Some people at my office order a couple sandwiches hours in advance of the scheduled delivery time. It's been an hour since delivery time, I called and they told me it should be here any minute.. it's been a half hour since then. I normally love jimmy johns but I'll never order deliver from this one again."}
{"text":"I'm super upset. I have a Jimmy Johns right near my house I go to all the time, and have NEVER had an issue. I just started work at Down Town Phoenix, ordered my sandwich online, walked to the restaurant and the line was out the door. I asked one Jimmy Johns guy where I should go if I did an online order, he instructed me to the wait at the pick up counter. After several minutes of waiting I ask the guy at the pick up counter as well and he says ask the lady at the register, so I ask her. This lady was so rude. After asking her kindly where should I go if I have a pickup order she says here, but that I have to wait in line. So I start to turn around to wait in line, and she says \"but I'll make an exception this time, but normally you have to wait in line like everyone else.\" So I said ok, then she asks me if I want to leave a tip. I politely tell her no thank you. SO SHE LECTURES ME about WHY I should leave a tip. Are you freaking kidding me? Is this really happening right now? Yeah. I won't be going back there. The people there need to get their shit together. Pick up order was between 12-12:15, left at 12:30. What's even the point of ordering online?"}
{"text":"Poor service (repeated my order three times and it was still wrong), loud music (probably the reason the girl could not hear me and got the order wrong), wrong change (even after I pointed it out, they did not correct it, the cashier walked away), no selection (no pastrami, no swiss, cheddar, only provolone, etc). Why would anyone want to eat here?"}
{"text":"Guy at the register was grumpy and very rude.  On top of that, they didn't get my sub correct.  No wonder I was the only customer in there.  I can spend my money somewhere else and I will."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but somehow they hand pick the worst person to run register.  I don't mind if you're stupid, but at least pretend to pay attention to the order and stop laughing and look behind you for a conversation that should be paused while I'm ordering.  The owner should be concerned."}
{"text":"If you like sandwiches in 5 minutes this garbage is for you. Foamy bread, gross ingredients. It is a fast food chain, I get it, but that really is not good."}
{"text":"Staff was rather rude. Man who took my order made me feel like I was a bother. Bread was tough. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Per the employee Jimmy John's ...\"I am not suppose to make the sandwich the way you want it, I have to make the sandwich the way I am instructed to...\" WTF???!!! My response \"You are not in business or have a job because of your personality. You have a job and open for business because of customers.\"  Will never return, and if they like Free Smells I am going to give them one of my own!!"}
{"text":"Their veggie sandwich is to die for and every time I go in there's always great service. I love jimmy johns, I could literally eat here almost every day and get the same sandwich daily. Great food and service, what more could you want?"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a JJ's. I thought that, for the price, that the sandwiches aren't worth it. They're not bad, by any means, but I'd rather go elsewhere. Personally, I didn't think they were much better than Subway. Firehouse, Jersey Mike's, and Port of Subs are all way better. However, this location is convenient and the delivery fee was reasonable, so I would've given 4 stars for that, but their sandwich construction wasn't great and it took an hour from order to delivery to get here. I had asked for the sandwiches to be cut in half but they weren't and the tuna came very messy and almost all of it was hanging out of the bread onto the paper. We had to stuff it back in."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible. Delivery has taken over an hour the last three times we have ordered from them and we are not even 1/2 a mile away. On top of that our order is wrong every single time. One time they said they ran out of bread and it took the delivery driver over an hour to go down the street and get more (this according to their driver) The most recent time it was because \"the manager chris is incompetent\" according to their employees. Nice and dysfunctional. At the very least follow through on the company business model of \"freaky fast deliveries\" but they're not even able to get that right. This location is garbage, stay away."}
{"text":"Everyone keeps talking about this place so I finally went. Sorry, wasn't impressed. I mean, it's a standard sandwich. I still feel that Capriotti's has a better sandwich. JJ's is decent. I think the bread should be softer. I will say that their pickles are great!!! Overall, not bad but not amazing."}
{"text":"Man I really like this place and usually they deliver to the Lied Library in less than 5 mins. I've been waiting for over 30 mins and still nothing. Called back and said the order was on the way. I get it it's raining but 30 min wait after being told 5 is weak"}
{"text":"I kind of have a complaint on this particular restaurant's leads and management. I stopped in one day, approximately a  month ago to inquire about an application for employment. This happened to be on a Wednesday or Thursday. I proceeded to complete the application and I turned my application in to the so called lead, manager, the guy in charge. He gave me the position, handed me a packet and asked me to bring in all of my insurance, registration for my vehicle. I told him I would complete the necessary documents and return Friday. I had an issue with a broken phone (only source of communication) and happened unexpectedly, I stopped at the store location to speak with said \"guy in charge\" and found that he was not available and was on vacation. So I  asked if it would be okay if I had started the following Monday as I needed to tend to my issue. The young man behind the counter said that he would leave a message with him and he would call me. I was under the impression he would call me as soon as possible. Well, I didn't recieve a call back til the following Tuesday and my phone was still in the repair shop. So I go back to see what the status of the situation is and the \"go to guy\" came over... remembered me, so I asked him if we're able to continue with our prior situation. He thought it would be ok to try and belittle me in front of his co- workers and his boss, I'm assuming. I explained to him about the phone being down and I assumed he would call. He stated \"I'm big on communication and the lack there of...\" he continued to frankly state \"had you done that again, I would be out of a driver.\" First you have to hire someone to be able to reprimand someone. This management contradicts itself and doesn't seem to know how to operate within itself. Keep your position because it's probably better that you do. He's \"big\" on communication but doesn't communicate."}
{"text":"I experienced the worst delivery service with this location. The guy that delivered my food didn't say one word to me and practically threw my food at me. Had I not ordered online and included the tip in the bill he would've received $0.00 for a tip, I would've given a tip on how to have better customer service. Won't be ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"I mean who doesn't love Jimmy Johns?! It's freaky fast and always delicious...what's not to love. I've eaten here plenty of times and have never had a bad sandwich. It's defiantly my favorite sandwich chains. There is something about that bread that makes the sandwiches so good...always fresh! I love the Vito but it's also nice because they offer plain sandwiches too. If you're not feeling the carbs then opt for the Unwich (lettuce wrap). It's fantastic, very crisp and refreshing."}
{"text":"Usually Great Sandwiches! ~ This location is hit or miss~ We've tried many JJ all over the country, and this 1 rated bottoms~ Poor Service~ Staff changes every few months, and the attitudes as other stated are pretty non-customer friendly ! Ordered a few sandwiches but the #12 stood as the one with the least love lol ~ Supposedly has avocado but you needed a microscope to find.  So even tho it's close by, may need to drive a little further for better experiences!  Meh!"}
{"text":"I was very excited when this place opened. It was near my work and they delivered SUPER FAST. Unfortunately super fast does not always equal super quality. I was okay with this for a while. They would mix up a few orders and sandwiches would be sloppy. I love that they have the lettuce wrap option but some of them were barely \"wrapped\" and covered in an insane amount on condiments. Again I looked past this for awhile ... Until I got the strange looking turkey ( Turkey Tom on the lettuce wrap). They obviously use luncheon meat but this meat was covered ( I mean covered) in clear jellied fat. So gross! As I was pulling the meat out ( using the term meat loosely here) I had to unravel the paper covering the lettuce wrap... And what do I find... Lettuce covered in fruit flies/small gnats! They are embedded into the lettuce! Little black bugs that would have gone into my mouth if I wasn't carefully examining my lunch.   I'll stick with taking my own lunch to work. No more jimmy johns for me. Ick!!!"}
{"text":"Very good service and yummy food I would definitely recommend this to everyone  if you like Sub sandwiches you will love Jimmy John's I love the Turkey Tom"}
{"text":"Tried the #12 Beach Club unwich EZ-mayo EZ-cheese and it was great! I usually get the sandwich with white bread, but I think the freshness was worth the slightly messy guac (which by the way, I can't get enough of). :)"}
{"text":"I placed my order online at 1:05pm, and received it at 1:50. The sandwich was very mediocre, and I wont be eating there anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"Bottom line: This location needs remedial wrapping classes for preparing their unwiches. We've been here multiple times for our low-carb Jimmy John fix, and EVERY TIME both of our unwiches start off with \"insides\" falling out because they aren't wrapped correctly (we'll go out of our way to go to the Germann location because  they seem to get it right).   I don't know...small problem? It doesn't help that the time before tonight's run, they forgot our chips at the drive through. I know what you're thinking; listen, I give up the bread so I can have chips. Don't judge me."}
{"text":"In a word, blech!   I have been avoiding this place for some time, but I feel compelled to warn others about the attitudes, lack of service and the poor quality of the food at this particular location.   Yes, like many others, I happened by this place while visiting the Arrowhead shopping center. I'm not a fan in general of fast-food subs and the like, but I made an exception since we've had their catering at our office for a few events, and (at that time) it had been pretty decent. And, to be fair, my first few visits to this location were pretty satisfactory, but unfortunately a good first impression only gets you so far.   First things first, the attitudes of the people working here are, generally speaking, disenfranchised (no pun intended). Talk amongst themselves and shoot the breeze, but stand there as a customer and you'll get \"the look\" as if you're interrupting something. Furthermore, they don't seem to do a very good job of keeping the place up to snuff, as the soda machine is often dirty/moldy, low or empty of your beverage of choice and tables take way too long to be cleared up and cleaned. Yes, you're supposed to pick up after yourself, but no, as a guest, I shouldn't have to take care of a mess that your previous guest failed to clean up.  Additionally, in terms of service quality, as others have noted, they just aren't very accommodating at this place. The typical attitude that they could, but choose not to help you, is prevalent. If they screw up your order (surprisingly common), you will barely get an apology and certainly no empathy. Case in point, I found a bug in my sandwich before, while removing the grossly excessive amount of lettuce, and all I got was chuckles from the neanderthals who were tasked with making me a new one. What a bunch of degenerates.   Worst of all, I think, is the quality of the food. I cannot count how many times the cookie was stale as a brick, whether it was the oatmeal or the chocolate chip or anything else. On the rare occasion that you get a nice, soft and chewy one, you can bet your bottom dollar that nobody else at the table did. What is with the inconsistency? Furthermore, when they make your sandwich, they go to length to put razor thin slices of cheese and meat, but by God, do they love to put in about 4x as much lettuce in proportion. I'm sorry but it's not a veggie sandwich and if lettuce is all I can taste, you're doing it wrong. Last but not least, the bread... what the hell happened to that? It used to be so, so good, warm and toasted properly and with a smell that made your mouth water. Now? Lukewarm, chewy, sometimes stale but never freshly baked.  Also, I would be remiss without saying something about the music in this place. Believe it or not, I have no issue with the choice of music they tend to play, which seems to be a mix of rock and alternative, but the volume... Jesus fuck! Turn that shit down you assholes. My ears actually end up hurting a lot more than my teeth after trying to eat one of their cookies.   So yeah, can't recommend this shit show of a sandwich place. Disengaged staff, stale cookies, crap bread, too much lettuce, skimp on the meat and cheese and, top it all off, they try to blow out your damn ear drums. I can buy an overpriced, mediocre sandwich from plenty of other places. Never returning!"}
{"text":"First time at JJ and first off I'll start with this location. Service was great and place is really clean with spacious tables to sit at. I ordered two sandwiches and they were practically done right after paying. That was pretty cool!  With that said there aren't too many choices to choose from just a bunch of the same variations and first glance at the menu it can be pretty confusing. So I'd suggest its better to know what you want before you come here. I was disappointed there wasn't any meatball sandwich or chicken breast. Com'on Jimmy what's up with that and this is coming from another Jimmy! Overall, I did love the fresh Italian bread better than other places and oh! the soft pellet ice from the fountain drinks best kind! And the bbq chips were good too. I might stop by again but just not that crazy about this place."}
{"text":"This place rocks!! The product is far above the best I have ever eaten!!"}
{"text":"Started a new job in the area. The boss ordered from Jimmie John's for lunch and I've been hooked ever since.  I've ordered the #9 Italian at least a dozen times in the last month, perfect every time. Speedy delivery and very reasonable prices.  Decided to try something different and went with the #10 roast beef and was not disappointed, lots of meat, good cheese.  The bread is not soft and pillowy like most sub places, but hard crusted, french style bread. It is very flavorful with that little hint of yeast aroma you find in fresh baked bread."}
{"text":"Finally a quick lunch option at work. I've been lamenting over the fact that it takes 30 minutes to get in and out of the Panera that is practically walking distance from my building. But a short drive down, hidden out of the way is this oasis in the hectic workday.  Last time I went, it was 11:45 - right before the lunch rush. The sandwich maker was asking my order before the cashier even had a chance to. From the time I walked in the door to the time I left with my order: 90 seconds. 90 SECONDS. That is incredible!  It's noisy and the staff is very social, but they do a great job. It's not a delicatessen, but it's good, consistent food that doesn't require half a day to get. Awesome!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend ordered the Vito for me to be delivered. Pictures are worth a thousand words.  I'll make it 1001...sad."}
{"text":"Always finding nasty hair in my tuna. The delivery driver Tor is very rude and slow. Won't be again, filthy workers!"}
{"text":"Sandwich wasn't that great for all the ads they have on TV. Customer service was good except they charged and I got an extra Sandwich!  So check order folks!"}
{"text":"I just attempted to make an order via delivery only to find that they do not deliver to my location. My office is located at 2403 Sidney St., only 0.7 mi from their location in the 1700 block of E. Carson. They told me I am outside of their delivery area which only stretches to 22nd St.  This is seriously one of the most asinine delivery policies I have ever heard. There are multiple corporate offices that stretch from 28th st. down to 23rd that this location is missing out on because of this delivery policy. Even the headquarters of American Eagle is less than a mile from their location yet outside of their delivery range.  I am sure the sandwiches are delicious and the staff is awesome at this location, but I will never eat there, just based on principle. Please, change your delivery policy and help your location access a large market of corporate customers that are certainly within reach!!"}
{"text":"I'm not exactly sure what happened to the \"freaky fast\" part of this store but 15 minutes for two sandwiches is not on spot with their ligi"}
{"text":"Expensive,  smallish sandwiches which are delivered light fast.  $17.95 for 2 sandwiches is pricey in my opinion."}
{"text":"Love that I can order online.  They ARE freaky fast.  Can order online quick and easy.  Good job, Jimmy Johns!"}
{"text":"On a road trip we quickly stopped to pick up some sandwiches. Warning- if there's anywhere else you can go, you should probably go there.  I understand that my order was not very simple, but they (yes there was 2 men trying to understand my order) asked me 3 times so I figured they understood. Nope, they couldn't even follow my instructions. They didn't even put one condiment on it... who gets a sandwich without a condiment? Beyond that. They didn't even slice my sandwich in half... oh and I asked for pickles on my sandwich and they sliced up a pickle and put in on the side?   Oh and by the way, they have a sign that reads 'No Hippies Allowed' .....  Don't have to tell me twice... I will never return to jimmy johns"}
{"text":"Wow! Service! I ordered a Tuna on Wheat, Jimmy Chips BBQ, a pickle and soda for delivery. I swear in under 10 minutes the delivery was at my door. Amazing. Food was pretty good, filling and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My lousy experience with this Jimmy John's started with an overcharge on my debit card. I ordered 1 sandwich and 1 bag of chips for a delivery. The delivery was fast and the food was good, so lets get that out there to be fair. I added an extra star because the food here has always been fine.  I logged into my bank account like I normally do, and there was a $19 charge from Jimmy's. That's one expensive sandwich. I called three times. Spoke to \"managers\" 3 times. My information was taken, and all 3 times, my call was never returned. I went there in person; Once again, my information taken, no call returned. There was a general \"I have no idea how to handle this, I'm going to call my boss/area manager\" and then nothing. This is really poor customer service. My call should have been returned the first day-a courtesy \"I am handling it, I will get your card refunded asap, apologies, etc.   Over charging a customer is a big deal. I gave the tip in cash, so I know that I did not key in a wrong amount when I placed my order online.  This was their mistake, and no effort was made on behalf of the management to help me. They've lost my business."}
{"text":"Visited JJ's back in June with a co-worker and ordered the \"Vito\" sub, which quickly became one of my favorites. I've been back here several times since.  If you are really hungry, go for the \"Italian Night Club\" - you won't be disappointed.  One word of advice - this establishment gets busy very quickly. If you expect to eat inside you need to get here a little bit ahead of the normal lunch rush. There are also tables outside on the patio, but that doesn't work too well in the summer months for obvious reasons.  Excellent service - fast, friendly and very reasonable. I don't think I've ever been to any sub/sandwich shop that has made me a sandwich this fast.  Good job, guys!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Had to call multiple times to find out where my order was. It took almost an hour before it was delivered. Every time I called I was told it is on the way. I will not be going back here."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service and even better sandwiches. The food was made quick and all the employees, including the ones working the sandwich line were super friendly. The store itself was empty besides my friends and I and the employees all had lunch together and seemed to have fun and when we went to the register to order more food, they were more than happy to help us and were so prompt with making our food.  Definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"Wow! I am giving this location 2 stars for the day. 2 employees were rude and I could not find the napkins. I guess they are behind the counter and you have to ask for them."}
{"text":"Update - The managers sent a more tenured driver out to deliver me lunch at no cost. This was very admirable of them and I am appreciative. My suggestion would be to send new drivers with \"senior\" drivers to show them where some of these harder to find buildings are. This should minimize instances like these in the future.  Older- (I like the food, but they have hired new drivers and twice now, the driver has gotten lost coming out here. I tried to give more specific instructions this time but it didn't work, they still ended up somewhere else. My past two deliveries have taken about 45 minutes. They used to arrive in ten. Someone there needs to tell the new drivers where to go when they're in question. I work in a call center so I can't answer the phone when the drivers are lost.  I guess I won't be able to order from here anymore.)"}
{"text":"Good food as usual...but disappointed to find no highchairs in the place. Not the best experience as we took turns eating and holding a squirmy 14 month old.  When we asked the staff where the highchairs were, he responded saying someone stole their 1 highchair. So, (1) why did they really only have 1 highchair? And, (2) are they planning to replace it??? It's rather important for those of us with little ones."}
{"text":"Not the best experience. Air conditioning was broke and very hot inside. One of the lights over the sandwich making area fell out of the ceiling while we were there. Top it off with hard pieces if bone in my roast beef sandwich. Not eating Jimmy John's for a while. In a side note. Could not get to the parking lot due to employees car breaking down and trying to load it on a car dolly. Chips were good."}
{"text":"After going to Jimmy John's every week for the last year (since they opened), I can honestly say they make a good/great sandwich and their people are friendly & courteous. That said, it makes me nervous to see that many workers stuffed behind a counter trying make sandwiches. Do we really need 10-12 people working at one time? Subway only has 2 or 3. Second, this JJ's location had the worst freakin ice machine in ALL Maricopa County. Please, for the life of Bono, fix the $&@\"%# ice machine!"}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich chain around, hands down. Im not big into chain restaurants, but I like JJ. Their food is good and well priced."}
{"text":"Ordered online and they got my order completely wrong....hasn't been the first time. Avoid ordering online at this location."}
{"text":"I Just Don't Get it. There has been so much hype about this place, I was really looking forward to trying it.  I was shopping at a nearby store when a Jimmy Johns delivery person dropped a lunch off for the woman at the register. The woman said she had ordered from them every day since they opened and she was really excited because she rarely had time to leave for lunch.   I drove straight over to see what ll the fuss was about. I ordered a sandwich and was surprised to find it wrapped and waiting at the other end of the counter before I had time to put my credit card away. I unwrapped the speedy sandwich, eager to bite into the bread I had heard so much about. Sadly it was dry and disappointing. It might have been wrapped at warp speed but it definitely wasn't fresh. I went back to the counter to see if there was anything they could do to help and they handed me a packet of mayo.   During the time it took me to choke down my sad sandwich, I was the only person seated in the place. The tables and floors in the dining area were  really dirty. Crumbs and garbage on the floors and tables, but no one came out from behind the counter to clean up the mess. There was one customer who came in for take out while I was there.   Maybe that is the attraction. If you want take out or can't leave work and need delivery this probably beats starvation but not by much. The quality and service I have gotten at Subway is much better.  I am hoping that maybe they were just working out the kinks of opening a new location. I have never been to a Jimmy Johns before but if this is what its like, I wouldn't bother."}
{"text":"SHORT VERSION: unsanitary. Rude employees.   LONG DETAILED VERSION: The sandwiches were fine from what I was told (I didn't eat anything from here), the staff however were extremely unprofessional. That alone is enough to give this review.  Upon walking in the guy at the register standing closest to us acknowledged us coming in (group of 5) but kept his back towards us and continued his conversation with the other employees, one of the other men then asked us (mind you not in a polite tone) \"does anyone know what they want?\"    We hesitantly placed our order, we were given back the wrong change, he handed us back $8 out of $10, we told him he gave us too much back, instead of saying thank you he argued that he counted it back correctly and didn't give us too much back, WHY THE HELL WOULD WE ARGUE THAT YOU OVERPAID US? Anyways, sandwiches were ready quickly,after opening the sandwiches we realized one wasn't correct, we asked for no tomatoes, handed it back and gave us the correct sandwich. The issue here is, the gentleman who was behind us ordered that sandwich with tomatoes, and the sandwich we TOUCHED and opened up with our hands was given to him!  All while this is going on, the business card/ gift card holder has been knocked off the counter the cashier just looked and the customer like he should pick it up because it fell in his side even though the cashier had knocked it down. I mean the whole place is a joke. We will never return to this location. It's a bunch of incompetent immature assholes who treat paying customers as an inconvenience."}
{"text":"Great bread and super fast.  Sometimes I like mustard on my sandies, they only have dijon.  But I obviously deal.  Italian Night Club is my favorite.  Its what keeps me coming back and back and back.    Did I mention the bread?"}
{"text":"Because I have to give a star to write a review but if I had a choice there would be no stars. Service is HORRIBLE. Don't ask for anything on the side because you won't get it. Don't get avocado because it's not avocado its guac and its a drop of it for .$75.  Not friendly and they make mistakes on orders.  Never coming back- Subway is more worth it then this place or making your own at home."}
{"text":"Uncomfortably cold inside the store, ac was blasting so strong that my empty chip bag was blowing around the table. Really loud and irritating music too. Eating a sandwich here is a great reminder though that Firehouse Subs is amazing."}
{"text":"Love jimmy johns by not this one. I live right around the corner so I keep going here hoping it to be as good as the rest but it's not. Staff has a lackluster attitude and sandwiches are always sub par. Bread seems to be not as fresh and they are VERY frugal with the meat. I normal get a number 5 and there were three pieces of sliced salami on it today. I think I'll finally throw in the towel for this location."}
{"text":"I eat at Jimmy Johns at least twice a week if not more (the one off Gilbert road) this Jimmy Johns has quick delivery but the sandwich is never right! What's so hard about adding extra Oregano and no tomatoes?   The amount of lettuce they place on their sandwiches is way too much, come on guys it's a sandwich and not a salad!   If you can't get the basics correct on a week night when the store was empty then I'm not sure how well this location will do. Oh, and your employee Shawn is a complete tool! Rude, unprofessional and no customer service skills."}
{"text":"I understand now why this location has a two star rating. Probably needs a 1 star. I've ordered twice now from them for delivery within the past two weeks. My office is .3 miles from their location. Literally across Mayo Blvd. both times it has taken them over, I repeat OVER 1.5 hours to deliver. Every time I called in they said \"we are making it now\" that was within 15 minutes of placing the order.   Figure it out. Hire more drivers? Just an idea."}
{"text":"Ordered a roast beef from this location at about 12:15 I asked them to hold on delivery until 1:00pm. I thought when you ask for hold on delivery that's also a hold on making the sandwich. Nothing but the onions and crispy chips saved this sandwich."}
{"text":"Disappointed with my order today. My sandwich was not prepared correctly. Also, had very little meat on it. $7 for 1 slice of roast beef on my sandwich? I'll pass next time. The only reason they get 2 stars is because of how fast it was delivered. Although clearly they sacrifice quality for speed. I've ordered from other locations and been very pleased. Probably won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Great staff. Clean restaurant. Clean restrooms.  Fast service. Husband and I have been to four JJs including one in NC. This is the cleanest yet."}
{"text":"Can't rate the food. They won't deliver to me. I am in Lakewood. 1.6m away. I don't really see how that is too far. I don't mind going to pick up take out, bit on this particular night that was not an option. Needless to say I ordered from someone who would deliver to me and they happened to be twice as far away."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying that I love Jimmy John's sandwiches but this location is awful. Worst customer service ever they are complete idiots. I ordered a sandwich and after 30 minutes of not getting it I called and they said it was on the way. Nope, another 30 minutes later and no sandwich. I call again and the manager said the driver called me twice and I didn't answer. LIAR! I got zero calls. I never got my sandwich?! Even after waiting that long I still wanted it but he just refunded me. Umm I ordered food for a freaking reason.   And then my friend ordered a sandwich a week later and it took over an hour. This location needs new employees. We live an actual 2 minutes away. Bye"}
{"text":"I love a good sub, and since I was here today, I stopped into Jimmy John's to grab some lunch after a hard day of shopping, slacking off, sleeping and overall counter productivity.  I went with the #2 big john, and it was tasty as always.  Service was great, food is awesome.  The only downside to this place is that the inside is really not set up for dining in.  It's painfully small, with one tiny side counter that you can stand at to eat.  There is seating outside, but if the weather is uncooperative, you are seriously out of luck.  (like in July when its 115, or if it's raining, you'd kind of be hosed.)  Because of the seating here, I would say plan on taking it out.  I mean, if the weather is nice, and you can find a place to sit, (which normally is easy to do) then you are in luck. If it's hot, or extremely crowded, then you would be stuck walking around Tempe Market place looking for place to sit down.  Will be back in the future, as its always nice to have something different every now and then. Prices are fair, service is great, and its a great place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Located in the District area of the Desert Ridge Marketplace surrounded by other small restaurants. This Jimmy John's is nice. The people working here seemed okay. Not particularly friendly, but not unkind either. They took my order quickly and made my sub just as fast. Ordered my usual the Gargantuan sub. Made with salami, ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey and provolone cheese along with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, mayo and homemade Italian dressing. Very fresh and taste was what I love about this sub. They are consistent with their subs, which is always a plus for me.  Pros: 1. Fast 2. Food was fresh 3. Clean location 4. Extra veggies are free  Cons: 1. Not very friendly staff 2. No choices for bread and dressing 3. One size sandwiches    Inside of the place was clean with all tables wiped down and floors swept. Trash was empty, drink station was full and the chips where stocked."}
{"text":"How I love Jimmy John's and this location is what I come to expect from a Jimmy John's.   This location is located in the shopping center across the street from WinCo in Henderson. It was easy to get into and out of. They have plenty of parking space, well at least at 7 pm on a Saturday night.  I ordered the #9 - Italian Night Club and it was DELICIOUS as always. No sooner did I put my debit card back into my wallet and my order was called out. One of the things I really like about JJ is how fast and efficient they are. Although I never come here in a rush, it is nice to know that if I ever was in a rush I'd get my meal super fast.   Employees are so friendly and greet you as you enter and always say \"have a great day/night\" as you exit. So nice to deal with people that are happy and look like they actually enjoy working there and want to make sure their customers are satisfied.   Inside of the place was clean and organized. Not super big so not a great place to come with more than one other person. Most of their tables seat just 2 customers."}
{"text":"Always fast and on top of the game!! I order from here atleast once a week and they know my name and literally have my order memorized. Great service"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is one of my favorite places around UNLV to grab some food.  They rank on the top of my \"fast food sandwich\" category, way above Subway, Quizno's, Togo's, or any other mediocre sandwich place.  Their sandwiches are around $5 for an 8\" sandwich, which is a great price for a good sandwich.  The service is extremely fast, and the service is friendly, which always makes it easier to come back.    The sandwiches are what really bring me back, though.  My favorite sandwich is The Vito.  The Vito is a classic Italian grinder, and is one of the most popular things at Jimmy Johns.  I always get the hot peppers, too, which makes the sandwich that much better.  I also really like the BLT, and the Roast Beef and Provolone.  I can't remember what these are called, but the menu's not too confusing to figure out.    The sandwiches are all made to order, and come out VERY fast.  Usually your sandwich is done by the time you finish getting your fountain drink.  Which brings up another great thing about Jimmy Johns, their fountain drinks.  I usually don't mention fountain drinks as being great, but they have Cherry Coke.  I always like to give props to any restaurant that has Cherry Coke, as it is a rarity, yet is one of the best sodas on the market.    Definitely go to Jimmy Johns if you love sandwiches, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service?  Plenty of workers there.  I bought 4 sandwiches and the employee set them up, I said i could use a bag,   he said \"go for it\" and walked away.  Next time I'll throw the pile of bags on the floor!"}
{"text":"Apparently I'm out of their delivery zone, being only 2.5 miles away it seems hard to believe.   Other than that, jimmy johns is a great-quick sandwich shop. However, this location fails at customer service and quality."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the service! First ever bad review on yelp and it's well deserved.   First time customer at this location. Called in for a deliver of just 1 sand which. After 30 minutes of waiting I called in following up on the status of my order, was happy to hear that my sandwich left the shop just a few minutes prior. Another 25 minutes go by, (I'm located 2.1 miles away from the location) and I get a  call that my order is out of their delivery vicinity and that my order will be voided- apparently it hadn't left the shop after all. I will not even go into the tone of employee but let the time increments speak for themselves as to the dedication of customer service at this location."}
{"text":"Newest location of Jimmy John's in Pittsburgh. Standard Jimmy John's experience, good, quick sandwiches. All sandwiches are cold which speeds up their process. Seating is a little tight, biggest tables (only two of them) are for 3 people. One design flaw is some of the 2 person booths are blocked when multiple people are waiting for their sandwich."}
{"text":"In the middle of Downtown Pittsburgh, Jimmy Johns is a breath of fresh air amidst the stuffy city. Because, unlike 99% of other eateries downtown, they DELIVER! Most people don't realize that hairstylists don't take that lunch hour.....we're chowing down while mixing your haircolor on the fly. Hence, we NEED delivery. Not only does Jimmy Johns deliver, their bike-riding delivery drivers get your sandwich and skinny chips to you sometimes faster than you can collect the cash from your coworkers. It's amazing.       Their sandwiches are good, reliable, and can be made relatively healthy. The employees are really nice, and very patient and cool with annoying modifications to the sandwiches. They also have awesome dill pickles."}
{"text":"Today I had the ultimate porker and it did not disappoint. The bread is fresh and tasty. I ordered five sandwiches and was out the door with them in about 5 minutes. Freaky Fast!"}
{"text":"Very quick delivery. My sandwich was a little warm... Tasted like the delivery drivers car wasnt kicking out that much AC. But otherwise I appreciate that when I asked for extra onion and oregano, they put extra onion and oregano."}
{"text":"I went into the store to order my sandwich. The staff was very friendly. After I ordered and paid, I took out my phone bc I wanted to return some texts while I waited. By time I got my phone out and unlocked it, my sandwich was ready! No lie! They really are freaky fast! Also the ingredients and bread were very fresh!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner with a group of 4.  I'd never been to this chain before and I don't get it.  Perhaps they have good quality ingredients as they claim, but all of the sandwiches were small with very little meat.  It was just not exceptional in any way and not worth the prices.  Also for a sandwich shop the menu is very limited.  I've had much better subs from grocery store delis, independent pizza/sandwich joints, and Subway."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here. First time I got a standard 8\" and there was barely any meat on it. Basically just bread lettuce and tomato. Second time I paid more and got one of the club style sandwiches specifically to get the loaded meat that it says it comes with and guess what? The meat wasn't loaded whatsoever, but the lettuce was. I got the average amount of meat you get on a Subway sandwich. Sure they make your sandwich in 30 seconds, but then it sucks because it seriously lacks ingredients. They also don't toast any of their sandwiches which is kind of odd. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The radio commercials say it perfectly, Super Freaky Fast! I live in the town homes across the street and had enough time to open a beer and turn the tv on before the delivery guy came. I was a disbeliever and am now a repeat customer. Kudos to your idea of cold cut delivery!"}
{"text":"Meh. You know, it is what it is. A freaky fast sandwich made by some chill people in the $6 sandwich range. It's always fine, sometimes the bread is borderline stale towards the end of the night. Recommend adding a touch of hot peppers for an extra zing to any sandwich you normally get. There's not really sitting room in this location, but why would you sit and eat inside when the outside world is right there?"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food but on the other hand the people that work there are terrible good grief a old black man yelled in my face and said I don't speak good English however I am Puerto Rican and English is my first name so I don't understand what the he was talking about and when I asked to speak to a manager it was some young white girl named Shyann who could barely even count 93 cents very disappointed in the service now I never go there anymore when I did go I ordered 300 dollars worth of stuff for every picnic guess who is not getting my business anymore Dustin Shaw! the manager, he sags his pants and is so unprofessional and he is young too weighing 700 pounds he is only 24!"}
{"text":"I ordered my sandwich 50 mins ago and have yet to receive it. I live about 200 feet from the store and although I could've walked there by now that is beside the point. I called to ask about my order and to my surprise someone NOT named Jimmy answered the phone. Suspicious? I think so."}
{"text":"I like Jimmy Johns but not this particular location.  Their speediness gets in the way of them making a better sandwich.  Mine are always thrown together in a sloppy fashion and lately I feel like they're shorting me on the turkey.  I've also found a piece of plastic in my sandwich before.  Gross.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This location is equally as good as the other JJ's locations I've visited.  Very fast, great sandwiches...that's all I want."}
{"text":"I like this place. It seems that the $10 lunch is now an everyday thing.  JJs is no exception to this, although you get more for your money here. Having tried a dozen other sandwich places, I can say that Jimmy Johns has the best bread I have ever tried.  Also, their roast beef is extremely good.  I like that they keep it simple:  meat, bread, mayo, lettuce, and tomato.  That's it.  Subway charges you slightly less for a sub on awful bread with 2 oz. of meat and a pound of veggies.   Plus, JJs has their own brand of chips, in various flavors.  They're very good. My only beef (no pun intended) is with the setup of this place:  carry-out only, DIY on everything - get your own bag, napkins, chips, drink, etc., and they need to pay more attention to the customers' side of the counter.  They frequently run out of straws, napkins, iced tea, and other items, as no one crosses the imaginary line beyond the sandwich-making counter. If I am ever in the mood for a sandwich, Jimmy Johns is my go-to place."}
{"text":"Sorry Jimmy John's, but we weren't impressed this weekend. My employer gave me a gift card for JJ's as a thank you, so I took the family for lunch on Saturday. The first thing I noticed upon entering was the really loud music. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy listening to music but this was borderline obnoxious. We had to raise our voices to hear one another. The woman taking our order lacked personality and was rude to my wife. They forgot to put avacodo on her sub and refused to put pickles on my son's sub. Instead, they charged us extra for pickles on the side and gave him a full size pickle, which of course was much to large to put on a sub. Their ice machine was out of ice and we had to ask them to refill the machine 3 times before they added ice. As far as the food is concerned, it was just okay. We're unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Perfect sandwiches... They forgot my drink but got it to me right away after calling... Very satisfied"}
{"text":"As I have mentioned in several reviews before, I have my own ATOS (Amber Terms of Service) in which my #1 rule is to never review a place that you have only been to once unless you know for certain you will not be back.  As I sit here eating this giant pickle, I find myself IN a pickle... because while this is the first time I have eaten at Jimmy John's, they DID deliver free samples to the office yesterday... so is that technically 1+???  Well, even if its not, I don't care. I am impressed beyond words at their incredible ability to serve their business clientele... Let me explain.   Yesterday, out of nowhere, a nice delivery boy from JJ just drops by 10 or 12 mini subs for the office to sample. Super nice. Great marketing tool. Everyone was happy as a clam. Who doesn't love free food?  So, today, I felt like it would be a good idea to return the favor and give them our business. We had 12 people order subs, and the entire ordering process was incredibly easy. You can order online, or call in the order. When everything was delivered, each sub had the correct name, they itemized the receipt by our names so that each person could have the correct amount deducted from their paycheck, and everything was 100% correct. No mixups.   Aside from the incredible convenience of their ordering, their friendliness, and the awesome delivery, the subs were incredible tasting and at a fabulous price point. The bread (even though I'm not supposed to eat it - whoopppps) was fresh and delicious, the veggies were all fresh and piled on, and my pickle was huge and incredibly satisfying. (get your mind out of the gutter)  You can choose 7 grain bread or a french roll, or for those who want the low-carb route, you can wrap your sub in lettuce! They have a great variety of subs, including two veggie options that can be made vegan, chips, pickles, drinks. Their website is really cool too - you can figure out the exact nutritional value of your entire meal, and the site is fun and easy to use.   Anyway - incredible all around. I am very impressed and can't wait for our next group order!!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this business. I order from here all the time, but I ordered online today and the order went to the wrong location. They charged me of course and then I get a call that they moved my order to the correct location. So they wanted my payment again, but they already charged me and did not put the money back in my account. The manager Daniel was rude and basically told me that it was not his problem and to call corporate. I called corporate and they said you have to wait 5 business days for the money to go back into your account. I said forget it. So disappointed and I will never order from them again."}
{"text":"Never had a problem before but today when I received my delivery order I realized it was the wrong bread! After calling to make them aware they said they'd have to come pick up the wrong order and exchange it for the right one! They refused to give me a credit unless they picked up the wrong order. My lunch is short as it is..I can't wait for another sandwich to get here. When I asked what they do with the wrong order he clearly stated that it'd be thrown away. I could easily give it to someone here in my office instead of knowin it'd be thrown away! Horrible to know food is being wasted for a mistake THEY made!"}
{"text":"the deli meats seemed slimy and the bread still doesn't wow me on my 2nd and 3rd visits."}
{"text":"So... horrible service at this location again. I work right around the corner at UH and we place large orders all the time. Tonight was the second time in 2 weeks where I called around 1030 and they refused to take my order. Stating that they were \"closing early tonight\" and were very rude. Mind you their website states they don't close until 12. This location has definitely lost mine and my coworkers business for good."}
{"text":"Bumping up to 4 stars~!!!   I was in a hurry so I was happy to find that they had a drive-thru kind of hidden off to the side.. There were no other cars so I placed my order and up to the window I went! The friendly employee rang me up and was holding a bag that I assumed to be empty but NOPE it was holding the finished sandwich... WTF I was seriously in and out of the drive-thru in like 30 seconds... CRAZY FAST! hahaha"}
{"text":"Have never had faster service than at this place! They are so speedy! The staff was nice and friendly too."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to for a lunch break or a quick dinner. You will be in and out in less than 5 minutes with a perfectly tasty sub and sandwich. I have always ordered the #5 which is named the Vito. It is a classic Italian sandwich and I always get it with hot peppers, which you have to specify during your order. It fills you up perfectly, the food tastes good, the service is beyond quick and it is affordable. So there is not much more to ask for when it comes to Jimmy John's. Also, they deliver so that is an extra plus."}
{"text":"I freaking love Jimmy Johns... NORMALLY! This location SUCKS! The people I dealt with were sad excuses for sandwich makers and lacked so much in customer service it wasn't even funny. I ordered a Turkey Tom and asked for sprouts in place of lettuce...I wish I would have taken a picture of my \"sandwich\" and it's sad attempt to live up to other jimmy johns but I was so hungry I couldn't resist getting it in my tum tum. I seriously could individually count the amount of sprouts they put on it. When I asked for more they literally gave me another 10. The girl was rude and the cashier was sagging his pants trying to play the \"I'm too cool for school card.\" Seriously so disappointed in this location. Not sure if it's a franchise location or what but it's definitely bringing the Jimmy John name down. This company should have stayed in Colorado where I fell in love with it and where the people actually care about making a good sandwich! I'm tempted to go and get another sandwich just so I can take a picture at how pathetic it is when it's made so \"freakishly\" fast...don't worry if you ask for more it's literally the same amount they gave you originally! Maybe they have to take inventory of their sprouts at the end of the night and only 10 per 'wich is allowed. Who knows. I say save your hard earned money and go to subway or even jersey mikes down the street! WAYYYY BETTER THAN THIS LOCATION!"}
{"text":"Sorry Jimmy but you lost three stars. Your sandwiches are alright but since you raised your prices ($1.50 per sandwich and now $1 PER item to deliver) we no longer care to order from you. Yes you are super fast, but I would rather wait the extra time from someone else then pay $10 plus delivery AND plus tip for a sub par sammy."}
{"text":"Fast.... Very fast.... Line was outside the door. I started to kind of panic but it went down very quickly.  We were at the counter ordering in under 10 minutes. This company is opening up new locations everyday. I can see why. Always a good experience at Jimmy Johns!"}
{"text":"Good sandos. Nice they make the \"Unwich\" - sans bread. Good for the carbo avoidance crowd. Nice crew. Looks like good management. Value is there. It's on regular rotation."}
{"text":"I should take Matt M's suggestion and order online - yeah. This place gets PACKED at lunch.  The BLT sub is good, and they do make the sandwiches pretty fast, but...wow.  People overload.   The employees are friendly. There's outside seating, and limited inside seating. This location is next door to Five Guys, which adds to the chaos.   Pros: Downtown PHX location Outside seating Yummy food  Cons: VERY loud inside Limited inside seating Limited chips selection The dilemma of downtown parking (unless you work within walking distance)  I agree...order online... Lucky for me, I can just walk across the street and pick up mine."}
{"text":"Made the worst decision of coming here tonight. The place was completely empty and had six employees behind the counter. Before placing the order we asked the bearded dude at the register what the U/F/W meant on the menu next to calories. He looked up at the menu, looked back at us and goes \"uh I don't know\" and then continued to stare at us blankly... well bearded dude, since you don't know shit about your job, let me help you out. It stands for UNWICH. FRENCH. WHEAT, you dumbass. I ordered a veggie sub that was already supposed to come with avocado. I asked the girl making the sandwich to add sprouts, peppers, oil and vinegar, and mustard to it. During the order she also stared blankly at me. So blankly that afterward I told my husband, that girl didn't listen to anything I said. But I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt because it wasn't a crazy request right? Guess what it came with? None of that. They also didn't put in the avocado. So here I am with a tomato, cucumber and cheese sandwich... yay. So to all the Jimmy Johns workers that f'd up one of the easiest sandwich orders, I understand that it probably sucks a fat one to have to make sandwiches for a living but it wouldn't kill you to make minimal effort at your job, would it?  * this review brought to you by extreme hanger."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is.....I think my tastebuds are damaged.  Why?  Because I am still thinking that Subway is pretty darn good!  a.  The bread - Definitely good, and at same time not memorable at all. Neutral at best.  b.  Fresh Sliced Meats.  I have bought seriously over the top expensive fish and meat at Whole Foods. Many times it comes frozen, and they put it out on display after it thaws.  I am not sure if fresh sliced meat is better than pre-sliced, but since I have purchased very expensive non fresh meat before from Whole Foods, I would say that I am the WORST person to dsicuss the phenomena known as fresh sliced meats because I cannot tell!  c.  The prices - Extremely reasonable.  Two sizes of sandwiches.  d.  Deliver - Wow, they deliver.  e.  Accoutrements - They add plenty of \"stuff\" after the meat, I guess that I am stuck on picking my own and then adding things like jalapeño, olives, spices, and all the other bits.  Here they pretty much put their basic items on the sandwich although you  can add or change this.  This is a nice restaurant, plenty of seats and a good solution with great value for the price.  These are 8\" subs.  I am still saying that Subway is awesome thought!"}
{"text":"I am completely disenchanted with Jimmy Johns. My wife and I go to Jimmy Johns all the time, but today, we were going to do things just a tad different. We knew we were going to be busy packing our house (we are moving), so my wife asked that I get the sandwiches but have the sauces on the side so they didn't get soggy.  I went to the location and asked they keep the mayo and sauces off. The rep said they had mayo packets; cool. No problem. I then ordered my sandwich, and asked they put the sauce on the side. He said they couldn't do that. I asked if I paid for a drink cup, could they put it in there. He agreed and pulled out the cup.  As we were closing the order up, we reviewed the order to ensure everything was correct. We got to the part where the sauce was going to go in the cup. The rep again said, \"oh, we can't do that.\" Shocked, I looked at him and asked, \"so I am paying for a cup of soda, and not getting any soda... But you can't put a small amount of sauce into it so that my sandwich doesn't get soggy?\" The rep again said no. I left the store.  Upon leaving, I called corporate, and the representative that answered stated they do not have a means to provide sauce on the side (Nevermind they were going to earn 6000% their cost from my paying for the cup). I asked if I could suggest that they come up with a way of providing cups or packets of the sauce. She said they do not do that. I replied that I would not be eating there again.  I am all for simplified menus and options; but when you have a customer willing to pay for something, don't you think you ought to consider earning a profit? It's not like I asked to get a burger or that they perform some illegal act. I asked them to place a sauce (that they provide) on the side (for which I would gladly pay $1.59), so that my sandwich would not be soggy one hour later.  Let me clarify - I don't have a sense of entitlement to sauce on the side (if that were the case, I'd expect it for free). No, I expect this to be the capitalist nation it is and I expect to pay for the 'unusual' requests I may present.  This experience epitomizes the extremely sub-par level of customer service that exists in our nation today."}
{"text":"I love jimmy johns :) I love the company and how they are freaky fast the subs are amazing ..however this location is a disappointment I live right by it and it takes them 45 min to an hour .. Although when you walk in it's pretty fast but still the night shift delivery blows"}
{"text":"Gr8 sandwich, awesome bread to go along with . Staff very friendly,  will order again without a doubt!!"}
{"text":"Great fresh sandwiches,friendly staff.If you're looking for a good sandwich,give them a try.Only drawback is very limited menu.Had just this gave this location in Gastonia 4 stars.When mom unwrapped hers,she hadn't taken two bites when what she though was stringy lettuce turned out to be brown hair.Called and asked to speak to manager and after being on hold 4 minutes was hung up on.Will go over there if they want talk on phone because dinner was thrown in trash."}
{"text":"The food is always good but please tell your cashier to be careful. When I purchased my sandwich, she watched closely as I was putting in my code for my debit card then after the purchase, immediately went to the back and got on her phone. It made me uneasy as if she were documenting people's codes in her phone. Probably should not worry but overall, did not look good."}
{"text":"I first ate at Jimmy John's when visiting Montana a few weeks back.  I was excited to see that one just opened up not too far from my house.  I think this is a great place to get a great, inexpensive sandwich.  I've had two different kinds of sandwiches and I thought they were both delicious.  The bread is delicious and so are all the fixin's that go on the sandwiches.  The staff is very friendly (overly so?) and they make the sandwiches very fast.  If you're sick of Subway this place can definitely compete with the quality and price."}
{"text":"Bootlegger (Turkey/Roast Beef, extra beef plus bacon). I had never had this particular sandwich place before. They may be huge in the midwest but there are only  a few of them in Phoenix.   Much better than Subway or Quizno's. The bread is fabulous and the price is very similar. It was excellent and I will drive the 5-6miles to go get it. Nothing negative about the food. Hope they put one in mid-west phoenix :)"}
{"text":"Ok. Let me preface this by saying I've ordered and had food deliver from this location to my same address over 5 times with no issues.   Today, I am pretty much bed ridden with a nasty cold and a sprained ankle plus I am pregnant. I called to place and order gave them my card and everything was fine. After waiting 30 minutes for my sandwich I got a call saying , \"I am sorry to inform you that you are outside our delivery radius.\"    Let's be real.  I understand that your policy might have changed since the last time I ordered from you two weeks ago, but you couldn't tell me that when I called to place the order? It was just unprofessional and terrible customer service. Won't be visiting this location ever again."}
{"text":"Love the new wraps,  the unsandwich with no bread just lettuce wrap.  Really a good idea I'm sure others will be close behind!"}
{"text":"Can't even deliver less then 1.5 miles. Worthless company!!   Fast service if your next door"}
{"text":"My 2 stars are based off service. I wasn't able to add vinaigrette to a sandwich without upgrading to a bigger one. I was told they couldn't even add salt and pepper to it because that didn't come on the sandwich I ordered. Then after the guy took my large order he went and sat with 5 other employees to chit chat while one girl (who seemed new) made all my sandwhiches. There was nothing fast about this place. The food was ok,  I've visited other locations which have been better. I'll skip this one next time I'm hungry."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here 3 times since moving to Arizona and I have yet to be disappointed! This location in particular is my favorite. I'm always greeted with a friendly, smiling face and my food is ready within minutes!   The Gargantuan definitely lives up to its name. This hefty sandwich is packed with double the meat and other delicious filings. It was a little too big for me, but my husband devoured it in one sitting. The Vito is my go to. It comes with genoa salami, provolone, capicola, onion, lettuce, tomato & an Italian vinaigrette. I add hot peppers, sprouts and avocado.   My only complaint is that they don't deliver to my complex. That doesn't stop me from eating there though."}
{"text":"Driver's for  Jimmy John's are a dangerous to the roads. Shame on you for hiring such fool's almost killed my brother"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service! Order was spot on and the staff made us feel welcomed. Smell of fresh bread baking and fresh ingredients is a nice touch for a relaxing lunch."}
{"text":"I order Jimmy Johns almost every time I'm at work near this store. It's a fun game of what'll be wrong this week. If you ask for mustard you don't get it. Ask for it to be cut in half? Can't handle that. Not to mention every single time the delivery driver asks me to sign but they don't bring a pen and expect me to pull one out? The food is always okay but it's just expected to show up incorrect."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is terrible. They are fast alright, really fast to mess everything up. I ordered a Turkey Tom and asked for them to add cheese and leave the tomato off. I took my order to go and when I got back to work there was no cheese and three slices of tomato staring right at me. Lets also not forget the mediocre bread which has a hard ass crust and isn't even mildly enjoyable to bite into. Honestly, Subway (which is absolute trash) makes orders faster than these guys and with less screw-ups. This was my first and last time ever going to Jimmy John's. Now all we can hope is that they stop making those ridiculously annoying radio commercials and focus on making better sandwiches."}
{"text":"I seriously love this location!! I have been in here probably 6 or so times and every single time the employees are super friendly, always have a smile on their face, quick service, always get my order right and thank me for my order.  Inside is always clean and picked up, the restroom is always clean as well.  I will forever be a customer as long as I live here and it stays this way!!"}
{"text":"?I have been coming here off and on for about 18 months now but will not eat here any longer and advise others not to either for many reasons. This has been a long time coming. First and foremost, my orders have been wrong too many times. Everything for some reason includes mayo, so u always have to ask for no mayo which they seem to get right only about 75% of the time (too low IMO). I have learned to ask 2-3 times in a single visit just to make sure as they often put it on even though I ask for none. Last week they told me it wasn't on there, and I got home and they had evidently put it on and tried to scrape it off and then lied about it. Unfortunately the sandwich had to be tossed due to an allergy. Love giving my money away! Ate somewhere else. Second, the staff here is consistently grumpy; never a smile and it's clear they are told to do greetings but they do so in a low voice and very insincere. Third, more than $31 for three sandwiches is excessive. Prices are about 10-15% too high for what you get. Fourth, they won't vary the oil mix which is what I get instead of mayo. They say it's an oil and vinegar mix, but trust me it's 99% oil. I asked for more vinegar and a lot less oil and they told me the won't change it. Fifth and lastly, recently I actually went back when they included mayo even though I had asked for none, and they actually told me it was my fault. When I showed them the receipt that clearly said no mayo, they literally stopped talking and just stared at me...no words, no apology, no offer to make it again, just silent staring like they were just waiting for me to leave. Sorry folks, its just a sandwich; it's not worth enduring all this and then to overpay on top of it. Poorly trained employees and average food on a good day. There are other options nearby. Go elsewhere, I do."}
{"text":"This place kicks Subway's ass!!!!!! They are actually fresh! Oh and they even wrapped my Club Lulu (turkey &bacon) in lettuce since I can't have bread ;) Yummy"}
{"text":"This is my automatic go to place when I am at work.  They deliver, and I am a work-a-holic and don't leave my seat often. The delivery guys have a great sense of humor because between 11-2pm we keep them repeatedly coming back here. No one communicates when they are getting JJ's, you just hear \"JJ's is here!\" and someone comes running for their food.  Extremely fast and friendly service. The ordering online is a HUGE plus for me. Any sandwich I have gotten from them has been amazing but let me highlight the Bread and Mayo. Their fresh french bread rolls and real mayo is out of this world.  You can order your sandwich as an \"Un-wich\" with a lettuce wrapping instead of bread, but I am not sure I would have the will power to do this.  The only thing I would love to see them offer is a cheese steak. That would be amazing.  Bottom line: I like JJ's and am impatiently waiting for them to build one closer to my house so they deliver there too."}
{"text":"Such a rip off!!!! I payed 5$ for bread and turkey! Yeah I asked for a plain slim because I didnt want lettuce or tomatoes. I said can I have cheese and then sliced pickles for the free add on. They said sorry no we're super strict on the plain slim can't have any free add ons. What??? Why can't u customize the sandwiches a little without having to pay a fortune! He said I can have it on the side tho I said ok. I got home and all they gave me was bread and turkey. Ugh., just can't believe that alone is $5. So irritating! sorry Jimmy Johns you should have better customer service and better deals than this!"}
{"text":"I have always had a good experience at Jimmy Johns.  This was the first time at this location.  We were greeted when we walked in which was nice.  After our sandwiches were prepared I asked for napkins and was told they are at the end of the counter.  I looked at the end of the counter and realized they were on the inside counter. I had to reach over the counter to get napkins.  She was so busy doing nothing that she couldn't hand me napkins.  My fiancee and I sat down and noticed a guy walking in who was about ready to start his shift giving the middle finger on both hands to the employees inside.  Also, the employees were so loud we couldn't hear our conversation. They were also swearing in their conversations.  I will never visit this location again.  No proffessionalism. I strongly suggest if you have kids, go to another location."}
{"text":"Oh how I've missed you so....  Get #12!"}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich shop in North Las Vegas. The portions are worth the price, the customer service is great and they are super fast. This location at Craig and Jones also has a drive-thru. Subway just lost a loyal customer. #DeucesSubway"}
{"text":"From the moment you enter this Jimmy John's off of Forbes, you are immediately greeted by the employees. This is a great place for a quick bite to eat in the Oakland area. You can't go wrong with a Beach Club any day of the week. I highly recommend having them cut your sub in half and taking advantage of the freebies to add to your sub. Also, the Vito and Italian Night Club are classic staples to get here! If you enjoy Salt and Vinegar chips these are the by far, the best that I've ever had.    I am sad to say the cleanliness of this franchise location is subpar, as 75 percent of the tables and floors weren't clean with only 3 people eating in-shop. This is the only reason for sub 5 star review.   Street parking is available next to the CVS, within walking distance to this Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"Just ok subs nothing special. I am not eating at any more jimmy johns anymore.....      ."}
{"text":"Not freaky fast. This location is Very slow only having one person make a sandwich. Other locations in vegas are really quick and freaky fast like advertised."}
{"text":"I placed an order for my husband 20 minutes before his lunch they are a block and a half down the street from my husband's job they were over 40 minutes late when I called I spoke to the general manager he was very rude and disrespectful and didn't even apologize the first time  they sent it to the wrong address and he won't even take responsibility he gave me nothing but excuses and was rude about it the whole time after calling back again he was disrespectful to me again and didn't even offer me a credit after delivering the sandwich to my husband at his job being 40 minutes late on top of that they gave him the wrong sandwich my husband lunch time was over and the general manager of this store was just so rude and arrogant and I don't see how he can run that store he just lost a customer I will never return"}
{"text":"\"purchase first!\"  My friend and I went into this Jimmy John's and were going to eat and bring my room a take out sub. and my friend wanted to use the restroom very bad. The cashier stopped my friend using the restroom and saying: restroom are for paid customer only. This part is fine. But after my friend said he will buy after the restroom. That cashier said \"purchase first!\" In a loud and impatient voice without making an eye contact. This is very rude, offensive and insulting. We end up not buying anything. I get why the cashier did that, and I also get how annoy it is to clean up the restroom somebody else's used. but you are doing this the wrong way! I worked at a dining service before. I totally get it. But you need to have more faith into people. If I were you I will let My friend or any customer use the restroom and wait for them come to make a purchase. Everyone's happy. My friend may said some inappropriate words to you when we left the store, I apologize for that. But this 1 star long rating review is going to your store forever!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good.  They have messed up my order multiple times. They offer to bring me a new one but I opt for the free sandwich on my next order. I have a limted lunch hour and do not have the extra time for them to remake and deliver me another sandwich."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's has your typical variety of subs. I actually like the bread better than subway or Jersey Mike's. That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. You can't change my mind either."}
{"text":"Spoke with the store today, employee was very friendly, but apparently Jimmy Johns only delivers within 1 mile of their stores.  We are between 2 stores, 1.6 miles from this one, and 2 miles from the other, so we're in a delivery dead zone.  This is a ridiculous policy.  Freaky fast delivery only if you're freaky close to the store."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of jimmy johns subs! They havre best fresh bread! And they have a veggie sandwhich! Which is a must since I don't eat meat! Their provolone cheese is fantastic. They always amaze me with their quickness to make your orders! The staff is always welcoming. I don't really have anything negative to say. 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"I used to work at a jimmy johns and I always made quality products but the sandwich I got here was a disaster. Im not going to give the place less than 3 stars because I'm sure because it was in the evening, they had new people working. I could tell because the cut on the bread was jagged. You guys, if you see a new person making a sandwich and it's less than the JJ standards, fix it. I'm not talking about the bread either. The sandwich itself was very sloppily made. It just tasted gross and something was off."}
{"text":"I have gone to many jimmy johns in Vegas and this one was the best they are very friendly and fresh!"}
{"text":"Clean, upbeat, friendly, and free smells! I got the Gargantuan Unwich, which is a Gluten Free giant sandwich wrapped in lettuce. I added Avo, they taught me the JJ way to order, LOL.   This thing was excellent, moist and delicious. I grabbed the two wrapped little sandwich bodies, and asked if they had cut it in half and they said yeah. But when I got home it turned out I had stolen someone's Ham and Cheese. Seems to be my week to break the law.  @__@ So I ate it. The bread there is great, too. Hehehe  Delivery is still Crazy Fast, they just don't say that cause they emphasize safety first.  You should try this location, no insanely loud blaring music screaming like the other locations."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are great. Made fresh and to order. Awesome I will return.  As they don't deliver 3 miles away where I live. Wish I could have delivered.   O well a nice way to get out."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns.  It is WAY better than Subway.  The bread is what makes it.  They bake their own bread right in the store and then right before they make your sandwich, they pluck out the middle of the bread to fill your sandwich with goodness.    You choose your sandwiches by number, but you can customize any sandwich.  I usually get the #4 which is a Tom Turkey.  It has turkey, lettuce, tomato, lettuce and sprouts on it.  I like their chips too.  They call them Jimmy Chips.  They are the kettle cooked type.  I personally do not think this is your ordinary sandwich.  The combination of bread and ingredients makes it a great sandwich and they are fast to prepare."}
{"text":"I am visited this Jimmy Johns almost every weekend. Last weekend I noticed that they had a new worker there wrapping sandwiches. I also noticed that she was chewing something. Again today when I was in there this same woman took my order and then moved to wrapping sandwiches she had stuffed something in her mouth along the sandwich line, I am suspecting that it is the bread that they rip out of the middle of the sandwich, because her cheek was way puffed out and again she was chewing. By the time she got the sandwiches wrapped, she had swallowed all that was in her mouth. I know it was the same woman because she has star tattoos all over her arms. I know it is a health code violation to be eating while you are preparing food. So what is up with this lady??"}
{"text":"Messed up my order and didn't make it right.   Ordered a JJBLT with all freebies on wheat for lunch.  JJBLT came with no freebies.  Asked for freebies after realizing halfway my sandwich was just lettuce bacon and mayo.   Staff looked at me and said it wasn't policy to correct sandwiches if someone ate it and went back to cleaning.   Asked twice.   Manager said I needed my receipt for my freebies.   Left and probably not going back to Jimmy Johns for awhile. Shame because they are pretty good but they mess up your order half the time."}
{"text":"A lot better then Subway for sure, great for late nights.  And they have Dijon Mustard   Tried #16 Turkey Club  JJBLT  Makes me wonder why the location in my hometown is always empty..."}
{"text":"Fist off, many people know that my favorite food is sandwich and that I used to eat At Jimmy John's a lot. \"Used to\" being the appropriate term. I was just humiliated at the Jimmy John's at the corner of Centennial and Main in Mesa AZ. Went in to use the restroom and get something to eat... in that order before my radio broadcast. However, they would not allow me to use the restroom before ordering. When I told them that I was going to order after I used the restroom because I didn't want to bring my food into the bathroom with me, they became very confrontational, stating that \"the bathroom is for paying customers only.\" Never mind that I was going to be a paying customer... for me and my 2 radio promotion assistants. Instead, I decided to leave and no longer deal with their harassment any longer. I did not order anything or use the restroom. While I left they continued yelling at me as I was walking out the door. Thanks for years of delicious sandwiches... but you just lost a long time devoted customer."}
{"text":"The food is good but they don't have salt or pepper in any form for customers. The employees aren't exactly all that bright and mind you ... lol this was my first time eating here. I went in and ordered a sub and the guy behind the counter talked about \"Jimmy John\" like he knew him personally. He acted like Jimmy John was Jesus. I suppose its just a bunch of over enthusiastic kids. Foods good.. bring your own salt and pepper or The jimmy John Nazi will yell at you! Get the Gigantic sandwich for 7 bucks.Its worth it. They pile the meat on so sayeth Jimmy John hahahah!"}
{"text":"FREAKY FAST!! So i walk in early just when they opened and there was not a jimmy johns team member at the register. So the \"sandwich maker girl\" asked me what she could start making for me!!!all i can say is WoW. I was out in like 3 minutes. I love this place."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery on a Sunday night while finishing up some homework.  The online ordering was quite easy. I decided to deviate from my usual hunter club and go with the #8 Billy Club, which was a mistake.   Delivery was really really fast, I'd say no more than 10 minutes from the time I submitted it. In all fairness, the store is literally right down the street from me, so I would hope it's pretty quick. I really should be less lazy and get the sandwich myself next time.  The Billy club was roast beef and ham. The sandwich was put together nicely, but I felt pretty skimpy on the meat. There wasn't more than a couple of slices of ham, and the roast beef had quite a lot of fat on it in some parts. I added almost extra everything including sprouts, hot peppers, oregano and tomato. They completely omitted the peppers which was disappointing. Not a bad sandwich, but I think I'll stick to the hunter's club that has a full 1/4lb of meat.  After tax, tip and delivery fee my sandwich was over $11. I think I'll just walk and get it next time to save a few dollars."}
{"text":"Very fast Pretty Cheap ~$6 for a large sandwich Normal bread and ingredients for the most part.  Slightly better than subway, I would say quiznos is better"}
{"text":"Great food, quick service, and manager shows appreciation for his customers. This location is always on my short list for lunch."}
{"text":"WOW! My order was ready BEFORE I got the money out of my wallet! Super fast!!!  The sandwich was pretty good, I like the shredded lettuce, somehow in my mind it makes the sandwich taste better, but that's just my way of thinking whether it's true or not.  The place was clean and the restroom was clean too. Good prices. I would return again if I needed a SUPER FAST food, quicker than McD's."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is always my go to place when I'm super hungry and need to eat now.   They have always been very friendly and the price is reasonable for a yummy sandwich, which I like their bread and I don't even like bread. I love the #9 Italian. I always get this one, my favorite! It is enough to split if you don't eat much or need a quick bite.  They are very fast making sandwiches and it's always been very consistent with any location I visit. This location is fast & friendly and clean too! Plus, it's also right next door to my favorite doughnut place too!  Located right behind Applebee's restaurant."}
{"text":"When I'm super hungry and need to eat fast before I get grumpy, I YELP the nearest Jimmy John location. Then, I read the reviews too. (Ignore the low star reviews for this location, people are whining because they can't get a sandwich delivered to them, boo-hoo!)  I really like Jimmy John's because they are FAST, no matter which I location I go to.This location is in a stand alone building with a drive-thru! You don't even need to get out of your car to get a sandwich!  Friendly and fast! The sandwich was fresh and made to order. The place was clean too!"}
{"text":"Great subs and fast. Nice guys working there. Very helpful. Will deliver within 2 miles. Good selection. Offered a menu. Open later which is good. I was there at 8:30 pm. I will be back."}
{"text":"The bread here tastes like chewy Styrofoam and the finally shredded lettuce is a turn off. Also I can't enjoy the meat wondering if it is made of endangered animals."}
{"text":"I like this place for the speed and the tasty sandwiches.  When I stop by at lunch even if it is crowded I still get the sandwich very quickly.   I've tried about 4 or 5 different sandwiches now and liked them all.  The quality stays consistent.  For a change try the 7 grain bread.  the store is kept clean the people are polite.  They seem to do a big delivery business as drivers are running in and out constantly."}
{"text":"I don't there is anything more annoying then being a couple miles away from a food delivery service that won't deliver food to u. I'm on university and greenfield.... literally two blocks south of this place and they refuse to deliver. So I called the location on southern and power and same shit. The manager referred to my location as a \"Jimmy Johns dead zone\" lmfao. Just a heads up people."}
{"text":"First time going, did not get my order correct but was nice with redoing my order. Cashier was kind of rude but over it was alright"}
{"text":"If you eat there or have it delivered, Jimmy John's has fast service, great food & good prices.  The key to their amazing sandwiches is their fresh homemade french bread!!! They  have a multi-grain bread which is good and a low carb option with their lettuce wrapped unwich, but there is just something so yummy about their french bread.   My husband loves their Gargantuan! It has ALL the meat on it! But i suggest telling them ez on the oil and vinegar, otherwise you'll have a handful of oil when your done eating it.  I have tried several of Jimmy John's sandwiches, but I usually switch between two. The first being the #12 Beach Club which comes with turkey, provolone cheese, avocado spread, tomato, cucumber and mayo. I always add onion too.  My other favorite is the #13 Gourmet Veggie Club; it has double provolone, avocado spread, cucumbers, tomato, lettuce and mayo.  The #14 Bootlegger Club is also a very tasty choice if you dig roast beef and turkey. I like to add cheese and onion to this one as well. The #15 Club Tuna is very good if you like a tuna sandwich; it comes with provolone, cucumber and tomato.   If you like chips they also have yummy bbq kettle chips. Also, my favorite crushed ice in their sodas.  Jimmy John's used to have alfalfa sprouts as an option on their sandwiches, but they have been removed them from the menu.  Last year I read they were going to slowly re-introduce alfalfa sprouts back into the stores, but as of now, they have not come back to Vegas.  If you are looking for a quick and satisfying place to have lunch Jimmy John's is the place!"}
{"text":"One word: Gargantuan.  Awesome in Jacksonvile; awesome in Columbus; awesome in Baltimore, and equally awesome here on S. Maryland Parkway in Vegas.  Definitely not for the faint of heart, there must be triple the meat that you'd usually find in a comparably priced Subway sandwich.  Only drawback is only one type of sub roll.  This location also lives up to Jimmy John's reputation for quick service.  Tasty food, quick service, and reasonable prices.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I don't usually order food to be delivered but when jimmy johns made it seem like they were super speedy I decided to order something the other day. The order was correct and food was still yummy but it took almost an hour to get here. Considering this place is literally two miles from my house I felt it should have arrived much sooner than it did."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time today...thought it was supposed to br quick. Took almost an hour to get a simple turkey sandwich. I won't make that mistake again."}
{"text":"I live down the street from this location. My son wanted me to bring him here so I tried it and was not disappointed.  The food is incredibly fresh, great flavor and they're crazy fast! I usually get the Pepe but I just tried the BLT and it was good, but I thought they would toast up the bacon, and there wasn't that much bacon. I still love this place, I just won't order the BLT."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's and I usually go to the one by my house on Windmill and Eastern.  I was Christmas shopping at Galleria Mall and was craving a sandwich so I looked online to see when the Jiimmy John's across from the mall closes, 9pm, great I can make it. I walked in at 8:39 pm and it looked liked they were already closed! I asked an employee if they were closed already and he stammered \"well, umm, yeah, we're closed already!\" I said \"Really?!!!\"  I just walked out, annoyed!"}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns was delicious. Restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend this sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 different sandwiches online, got two of the same sandwich. Checked online and the receipt and was most definitely not a mistake on my end. So frustrating."}
{"text":"Slowest delivery of any Jimmy Johns (avg 45-60 min at half a mile away) which is why you order them in the first place. Sandwiches are good if you don't mind waiting or going in."}
{"text":"Jimmy johns will always be my go to sandwich shop, I've had Jimmy Johns at least 3 times this week! The bread is so yummy and I haven't had any other sandwich shop with that kind of bread! The staff is always so nice when I ask for a BUNCH of mayonnaise (yes I love a lot of mayonnaise!!) and they're always smiling when I walk through the doors!"}
{"text":"Update:  I just took a star away. Yes, I did walk in about 15-20 minutes before they were closing. Yes, the employee was clearly cleaning up the sandwich area. But, I didn't think I was going to get a sandwich with no tomatoes and one slice of bacon. Look, if you are going to make me a bad sandwich, just tell me so I can walk next door!!  So, it's half star demotion for the sandwich and half star demotion for not being honest that I was going to be unhappy.  Original post starts here I work nearby and eat here about once a week.  I've never had an issue with the sandwiches, the parking, or being nearly killed.  The food is good, but it's a bit pricey when you get chips and a drink."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich. Disappointing service. Very Disappointing experience.  The ticket was about $3 more than I mentally added up because of up added charges. Extra $ for the 7 grain bread, extra $ for cheese, extra because they charged both sandwiches for Avocado when it was only on one sandwich. There are too many other great restaurant choices for sandwiches. I don't like feeling tricked. Buy local ... Better ideas."}
{"text":"We love this new location! The staff is friendly and super fast! My daughter and I love our weekly lunch dates here! Very clean facility! The Lulu Un-Wich is bomb"}
{"text":"I love their sandwiches. My friends feel that Johnny McGuires has the best sandwiches in town but I love me some JJ's. They have the freshest bread and their service really is freaky fast. By the time your ready to pay for your order they hand you your sandwich. They also have a great atmosphere. All the employees want to be there and have fun working at JJ's. I remember a few times employees would give me extra day old bread, its still delicious and its going to go bad anyways. It was a service enhancer and I will reward them with plenty of visits. Today I tried their vegetarian sandwich on wheat bread and it was perfect. I will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Good, clean,  fast service-what you'd expect. Build your own sub or order from pre-put together menu. Lots of kids in heart of UNCC university town.   Parking lot and parking garage. Two floor of stores and other nice eateries."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot. It's a good value for the price. Then sandwhiches are better then subway and way cheaper! Love them."}
{"text":"I work down the street from this location and sometimes it isn't easy to get away from your desk for lunch. I have ordered from here multiple times and have gotten great service. But the last month its gone down hill and fast! We used to get our delivery within 15 minutes, now we're lucky to get anything within the hour! I ordered from here today and already, I'm approaching the 1-hr mark. Not sure if they changed management or employees, but they are definitely bringing down their trademarked slogan of 'Freaky Fast.' Be weary about ordering from here and NEVER pre-tip them; my manager ordered from there last week it took them almost 2 HOURS for delivery!! C'mon! Take some pride in your job!!"}
{"text":"Friendly and quick. What else is there to this franchise? Everything was clean and food was good."}
{"text":"Freaky fast, more like sarcastically slow! It took an hour, yes, an hour to have ONE sandwich delivered! This location needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"I always get the Italian sub and add the cherry peppers. So yummy! Good customer service. Not crazy about the prepackaged cookies but everything else is yummy"}
{"text":"Hello friends,   As I approached the back entrance I seen two delivery guys running to their cars for delivery. I seen another guy already in his vehicle leaving and another pulling in. So those commercials are pretty accurate.   I was going to go to Lennys down the street but remembered JJ was open and i LOVE their bread.  It's so soft, yet chewy. Lawwwd have mercy.  I got the GIANT number 9 (Italian). $13.99 with a side of their new Ranch dipping/dunking sauce. One side all the way & the other side with peppers for an added kick.   I asked that they would cut/wrap them as two separate sandwiches so I could eat one then and the other half later. Awww lawd 13.99 is a bit much for another sandwich somewhere else but JJ makes it all worth wild.   Go enjoy, TTFN"}
{"text":"Hello friends,  This is one of their new locations. Still fast. Still friendly.   Parking sucks. And I can just imagine the neighbors putting up no parking signs on their lawns soon if not already.   TTFN"}
{"text":"I typically order from here at least once a week but today was a shocker. I should have known the minute the kid picked up the phone it was going to be a disaster. I had to repeat my order three times and was told it would be there in a few minutes. 30 minutes later I call to ask where my order was and was told they were short handed and the driver would be at my location shortly. I told him at this point my lunch was over so to go ahead and cancel my order. No offer to compensate me, no offer to fix the situation; just ok we'll cancel it. The delivery guy shows up and proceeds to tell me about the issues but offers no solution. Hey, I get it gets busy but just be upfront and honest about it so I don't waste my 30 minute lunch break. I most likely will not be calling this one for a long time to get food. I've got plenty of other options by ASU that will be happy to my and my salon's business."}
{"text":"It's silly that their delivery zone is so small! I love their sandwiches but sad I have to cross the street to meet them at Circle K if I want a sandwich which I'm not willing to do. So, I guess Firehouse Subs that is next door gets our business"}
{"text":"Debated between 3 and a 4 star rating. Truth is, it wasn't busy at all while we were there, so there was no excuse to mess up my order. I will update with a better rating if I have a better experience next time. My gargantua sandwich was just missing toppings like pepperccinis, Jimmy John mustard, Dijon mustard and pickles. For me, these topping make a sandwich. These are my favorite things. The woman that took my order said all were okay to have on my sandwich but then I never received them.   Toppings can really add flavor to a sandwich but the bread was fresh and they gave me mustard after I asked for it. I just was annoyed that the sandwich wasn't spicy at all and I had to go back to the counter twice as customers started coming in after we got our food. I wasn't given any napkins so I had to go back a second time for those. Then when I realized they put no peppers on top of that, I just gave up going back. I'm full-term pregnant so all the up and down was bleh I just wanted to sit down and eat. All in all I would go back, I would just remind the people making the sandwich about the toppings before I sit down.   Also, the fan kept blowing our food away and the music was a bit too loud, I couldn't understand what my friend was saying during our entire time in there. Other than that, it was great. Came here instead of Omelet House, which is one of my favorite places on Charleston, because Omelet House was packed due to the holiday. Service was really nice at Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"The subs are a no brainer, but if you're looking for a fast delivery you're not going to get it. I ordered online, and live close to the store.... Took approximately 45 min for delivery. Unreasonable amount of time for how they advertise about being \"freaky fast\". I would probably just walk there and back next time in order to get my food quicker."}
{"text":"The beach club and Italian night club are the best! Very affordable and open late at night. They even deliver and the staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"Roast Beef Sandwich leaves a great deal to be desired.  Where's the Beef???!!!"}
{"text":"I normally think Jimmy Johns is a safe bet, since I know what I am getting. I am not going there because of the crazy ingredients or mounds of meats-- I go there for the bread-- soft delicious bread. Normally. But much to my sadness today, my bread is DARK brown and crispy ALL the way through. Note to the staff-- don't burn the bread in the first place, but if you do, don't use it. You aren't doing anyone any favors..."}
{"text":"The cashier seems somewhere between pissed-at-the-world and comatose. Can't even say hello.  Acted like I was putting him out to be asking for a sandwich. We will pick other options in the future."}
{"text":"Was not able to deliver to my location. One hour after ordering, called Jimmy Johns and they claimed they called me 3-4 times. But, I did not receive a call regarding drop off, I did receive a call 5 mins after ordering to confirm location which proves my phone was working. Had a friend call my cell phone to determine if my phone rang (right after talking to Jimmy Johns, after the hour wait) but my phone was working correctly. Cancelled the transaction. Don't always trust the Jimmy John's delivery system. I trusted them today because I had intended to eat Jimmy John's for lunch. I'm still hungry but won't be able to eat a meal until 5 hours from now because I'm busy. Sometimes delivery is fast, sometimes slow, this time, just was not delivered."}
{"text":"Just not the service I expect from JJ. Easily the slowest JJ even when I'm the only person in the place. I don't do delivery so I can't say how that is. The bread and ingredients are always fresh but there's always way too much lettuce (maybe to hide how little meat they give you). Not up to the standard I expect from jimmy johns as far as quality and speed."}
{"text":"Ahhhh Jimmy Johns. Lately I've been wanting to eat this all the time. I usually grab jimmy johns from the UNLV Maryland location because it's close to work when I need something fast on my lunch break. After dreaming of a veggie club all day my boyfriend said we could stop by after the gym. Although they weren't as fast as they usually are here, mostly because their was a family of 5 ahead of me. I still appreciate good customer service and the fact that they added hot peppers to my boyfriends sandwich at the last second. Even though they took a few extra minutes the sandwiches are always so good. The bread, the mayo and ingredients. I don't even miss the meat on the veggie club but every sandwich I've ordered I enjoyed. Italian night club, bootlegger club and turkey club are all delicious. I love how they display the ingredients they use. Good mayo, grey poupon mustard, hot peppers etc. I'm convinced it's the delicious bread and Mayo they mayo the sandwiches so good, it really makes a difference. Just don't leave without a pickle. Even if your boyfriend asks you if you have pickles at home. Yes I have pickles at home but the pickles here are fricking amazing!"}
{"text":"Being from the north-east, I had never even heard of Jimmy John's, never mind eaten at one.  So when I was craving some sandwich goodness I decided to try it out.  If Subway is 2 stars, Jimmy Johns is 3 stars.  Definitely a step-up from Subway, but nothing super spectacular.  I got the Vegetarian sub, easy on the mayo.  It was simple, and tasty.  The bread tasted good but was really chewy.  After finishing my sandwich I felt like my jaw got a pretty good work-out.  I was also disappointed by the amount of avocado spread, or lack there-of.  There was just enough to add flavor, but it didn't make up a very substantial part of the sub.  Cucumbers were crispy, tomatoes tasted fresh, and the sprouts were good.  For such a simple sandwich, it would have been nice to have something other than iceberg lettuce...kind of just seemed like filler more than anything else.  Overall, it was good.  Service (at the drive-thru) was really fast.  I'll definitely choose Jimmy Johns over Subway in the future when I'm in need of a \"fast-food\" sandwich, but I'm not sure I'll go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"I'll just say i only order out when I'm feeling lazy and I love that they deliver however no matter where I live ( chandler, Tempe and now Gilbert)they won't delivery there which is annoying I live 2 mile from this place and they say they don't go that far ... I don't care how fast they are if you only going 2 miles out you better be fast!"}
{"text":"I would like to formally preface this review by announcing that my love for Jimmy John's is only eclipsed by the love I have for my family and kids.  I've eaten at Jimmy John's franchises in Florida, Illinois, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, and typically anytime I find one anywhere in between.  JJ's was my #1 pregnancy craving with my two babies.  It was a huge reason I've felt homesick for the midwest (before locations started sprinkling the Phoenix valley). Look at my facebook page!  My profile pic, in two different instances, is me with my JJ's sub or cup!  I have the JJ's party cups in my cupboard, and I hate clutter, hodgepodge, and crap! People CALL me when they see new locations.  I mean, an ex-boyfriend called me years after we'd broken up to tell me he saw one downtown, and he just knew I loved it so much I should know this!  (Duh, I totally already knew, and I told him to lose my number.)  That being said, I have officially experienced my first poor sub from any franchise, any time of day or night, any city, at this one on Bell.  It pains me to disclose that my utterly perfect sub (#10 with dijon and sprouts) can actually be disgusting. And at the location nearest to my house! I was shocked, heartbroken and bemused. How could it be??  Because of my intense loyalties to this chain, I can assure you I will be back.  But, my rose colored glasses are off, and my dear beloved JJ no longer ranks first in my heart of men who've never let me down.  It's a sad sad day, folks."}
{"text":"I love jimmy johns .... order like twice a week .. but ... y'all Got my order wrong ! I was looking forward to cucumbers on my sandwich guys ... bummer"}
{"text":"This location is just around the corner from where I live, and I've been meaning to try them for quite some time now.  I finally decided to come in for lunch and I knew in the first 20 seconds when I asked my first question, that I wasn't going to like this place very much.  I saw the white hoagies behind them on the shelf and I asked if they have wheat and she told me they don't but showed me the deli sliced wheat bread.  I settled for the white hoagie, ordered the #14 and yes it was fast and service was fine.  I get home and it's a very very basic simple deli sandwich, no wow factor, nothing unique about it, and nothing wrong with it.  I just didn't care for it. I felt they are in line with subway being a basic sandwich nothin special. At least subway has a variety of bread options.  I'll stick with my top favorite being Jersey Mikes or even Port of Subs.  Everytime I get Jersey Mikes, I devour their sandwich. It's soo good, lots of toppings, great bread etc.    I'm glad I finally tried Jimmy John's but it's not for me."}
{"text":"So I order my lunch which totaled 7.00 however they charged me additional 35%.  I really thought that included the tip for the delivery person when I ordered.  When she arrived she went to explain how she did not receive any of the delivery fee and wanted to know if I would tip her.  First I thought tipping was optional and second that deliver fee is rather steep for none of it to be shared with the delivery person.  I can understand her being upset however it is the customers choice to tip and your choice to work at a place that has such high delivery fees."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery about 2:10 this afternoon. It took over 1/2 an hour to get 2 sandwiches delivered about 2.5 miles away. When our delivery finally arrived, the sack smelled of smoke. Also, we ordered and got charged for ranch that we did not receive. Our sandwiches were soggy, as if they had been prepared for quite some time before being delivered.  When the manager was called, it took over 2 min to get him on the phone. His attitude was less than professional as he acted as if the call was a waste of his time. He did not apologize, and rushed me off the phone. About 30 min later, the same delivery guy delivered a cup or ranch. What was I supposed to do with a cup of ranch an hour after our subs were delivered!? I will not be ordering from this Jimmy Johns again and will recommend my co-workers do not either."}
{"text":"Consistently great sandwiches, whether eating in, taking it to go, or having them delivered! Awesome, friendly staff greet you with a smile as you enter! Restaurant is always clean. The only place in town that we get subs & 1 of the only 2 places we'll eat in town at all!"}
{"text":"An $8 sandwich loaded up with old browning lettuce. Yum. Yeah right."}
{"text":"Good job @jimmyjohns! Had less than stellar service last Sunday from the Raintree and 101 location BUT they a. Didn't charge us for our large order AND b. The GM called me personally today to apologize and get my feedback. Customer service speaks volumes! We will definitely be ordering from them again and giving them a second chance! #honesty #humility #greatcustomerservice #jimmyjohns"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my $8.79 meal.  3 thin slices if cucumbers? Really? Maybe a 1/2 of ounce of avocado, if that could barley tell I had added onions.  This isn't a veggie sandwich, that would require a substantial amount of veggies. Bummer because it's so close to my work"}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is a great franchise. Downtown Steel City ordered a big Italian,8 in, no mayo, hot peppers, pickle on side. Fresh as usual, but could not even taste the peppers. So, minor disappointment in an otherwise good meal. Pickle excellent."}
{"text":"Came in today (5/24/18) at 5:30pm. The cashier was very sweet. After I ordered the Giant and asked to only put mayo on half of the sandwich - the preparer gal (with random tattoos on her arms) rudely said that they can't do that. She could have said it in a more pleasant way because at first I thought that she was joking, but obviously she was not. And after finished our sandwich we began to walk out and the 2 ladies didn't acknowledge us because they were having a personal conversation so they didn't even thank us for stopping in. We were the only customers the entire time that we were there. I've been to several Jimmy Johns locations and always have a great experience but I will never go back to this one."}
{"text":"Always an amazing sandwich. I had these twice. Both were delivery and they came with in 15 minutes of ordering! The bread is unlike any other. Try the beach club. I am giving this 5 stars because of how quick it came and how delicious their bread and sandwiches are."}
{"text":"This Jimmy Johns has the best customer service. I was not abke to usemy card so the mananger came over withthe sanwich. He said dont worry about it. What a great place to go.....Amazing people that work here."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is hands down the best chain sandwich shop. The customer service is always awesome. I have never had a bad sandwich. They definitely have great quality food. They will make it just how you like it and for the most part they always make it the way you ask without any error. There is normally no line but iIf you call ahead you can get your sandwich even faster."}
{"text":"Wow... where do I even begin? I waited almost an hour for my sandwich to be delivered and the store is right across the street from my office building. I get my sandwich and my drink and my drink is completely watered down like its been sitting in the drivers car since i ordered it, and the edges of my sandwich were all wet soggy...disgusting. I couldn't leave my desk today nor did I have any other food so I forced it down, but that was the most disappointing lunch I have ever had. So gross."}
{"text":"I've ordered here twice and have been dissatisfied both times. The first time, I had hard bread. The second time, I asked for avocado on my sandwich, which you have to pay extra for, and I didn't get it. When I called to complain the manager cussed on the phone and was very unprofessional with out she dealt things. Normally love Jimmy Johns, but will never be coming back to this location. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I definitely like Jimmy John's. It's my favorite place to pick up a snack in between classes.   I like simple sandwiches and Jimmy John does some great, cheap, simple sandwiches.  Their 'slims' (no veggies or sauce) on the menu are only $3.25, plus I can pick up a ~14\" piece of day old bread for like $0.50, and I've got myself a full meal for like $4; I can't complain about that!  The staff have always been really friendly.  I think they're forced to sort of yell \"Hello\" and \"Catch you later\" as you enter and leave the shop.  But they sound sincere enough, so I'll say that's a good thing for them to do.    But, no complaints here. However I can't really complain about nothing and give it 4 stars, so:    Analyzing their pricing a little more carefully I discovered that for $0.75 more you can go over to subway when they're doing the $5 footlongs and get like 3-4 more inches of sandwich for 75 cents more.  I did some calculating:  You'd save 12 cents an inch of sandwich by doing this!  Over your college career that'd be approximately $240 (assuming an average consumption of 2 sandwiches/week for 4 school years).  Just some food for thought.    Luckily Jimmy John's gives me a $1 off for not getting veggies (which brings me to about 1 cent/inch cheaper than subway), so I don't have to make that decision."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service! i will never return. Our office spent $50 on sandwiches for our lunch. we ordered a total of 5 sandwiches which were on our receipt. When we returned to the office there were only 4 sandwiches in the box and when we called to notify them, he said we were lying ! First off that is not the proper way to take care of your customers. He said he did not have proof that there were only 4 sandwiches in the box. will never return here! they can have their shitty ass food along with the shitty ass customer service ! ill stick to Cappriottis ! :)"}
{"text":"Dear employees of this location.  Complaining about your hours and schedule instead of making my sandwich is a quick way to get your hours cut to zero. Freaky fast.pffft. Freaky yes,  fast, no."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Yes, they were fast... my sandwich was made in 1 minute. Was it right? No. It made no sense since my coworker ordered the same sandwich right before me... and hers was made right (made correctly with sprouts). My Vegetarian #6 that I ordered with no cucumber but added sprouts ended up being a sandwich with just lettuce, tomato and provolone. The avocado spread was non existent (although it supposedly comes on the sandwich). I reported my poor experience to Jimmy Johns and they offered me a free sandwich. However, I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon as there are much better sandwich shops in the area. If you want quality over quantity... this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"You want super fast food and amiable service? Well, this is the place to go for super fast 8\" subs. You'll need to pay for the parking meter though to eat at this place."}
{"text":"Coming from California, it's relatively normal for people to take pictures of their food and such. I was quite shocked when the manager forbid me take a pictures here at all... Is this an Illinois thing?   Anyway, the people here are extremely amiable. The service is extremely fast too. Their subs are 8 inches long. The premium subs all cost $5.60. The original ones generally don't come with cheese and are priced at $4.59. To compare prices: on average, you pay $0.50 per inch of a sub at Subway and you pay $0.63 per inch of a sub here."}
{"text":"Yum.   My girlfriend who is from Chicago initially introduced me to this place.     For the longest time it was a once-in-awhile treat whenever I went down to Tucson but now its finally here, just down the street.    Now that there are Jimmy John's in the Valley, there is absolutely no good reason to go to Subway whatsoever.     Better bread, better meat, better cheese, Jimmy Johns is awesome!"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from here at least a dozen or more times and it is always \"wicked fast\". I am about 1/2 a mile from them and even when I call at a busy time like 6pm and they quote me 20 minutes, my sandwich arrives within 10 minutes. My staple go to is their Turkey Tom (add provolone, vinegar, and oregano)."}
{"text":"I'm a Jimmy John's fan from living in Minnesota. I was excited to see a joint open up in this area!  Free smells? Tons of humorous reading entertainment on the wall? Friendly service? \"Freak fast\"? Yep, all here.  Healthy fast food, way better than the so called \"underground-rapid-transit\" sub place, and super tasty food make Jimmy John's THE go to place for subs and sandwiches.  Sandwiches being one of my favorite lunch foods, there are several important factors that go into a superb sandwich.  First, you need to start out with doughy, thick, and flavorful bread (multi-grain bread is a top pick); check. Next you need some sort of crunch, such as fresh and green lettuce, crispy onions, or pickles with a snap; check. Most importantly, you need a variety of flavorful protein like turkey, chicken, capicola, salami and more that will compliment each other; check.  Oil and vinegar dressing is oh so simple but oh so savory and sweet. Tons of available free add-ons, cheap and speedy delivery, and whole pickles available as a side... what more can you ask for? Okay, you want a cookie? They have those too!  The employees have fun while working and actually eat the food on their breaks (good sign that the food is good). You can buy the regular sub loaves at the end of the day for cheap, and if you are not wanting to eat much bread, you can get your sandwich as an \"unwich\", which is all the regular stuff wrapped in enormous leaves of iceberg lettuce. (Try the Gargantuan as an unwich; it's packed with meat, it's delicious, and it's definitely filling.)"}
{"text":"I love this jimmy johns! Every time I call they say hi Stevie! You want the usual? I say yup! And the moment I hang up I swear I sit down and they are already at my door! You guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"Gone to Jimmy John's twice this week. Man they have the best subs anywhere."}
{"text":"**This review is for the Goodyear location off Estrella Parkway by Walmart.**   I've been a fan of Jimmy Johns for the last 4 years. Was actually surprised to see one in Goodyear.   Anyways, I have yet to be disappointed. Until now, my order is not very hard to follow. I've ordered the same sandwich for the last 4 years. The number 9 \"Italian Night Club\" without mayo and onions, add dijon and peppers. As you can see, it's not very difficult or confusing. This place has managed to mess that up. The cashier even told the maker (young male w/ brown hair) what I wanted. They didn't even bother to put lettuce in it. How's that even possible?   That's strike one on this Goodyear location. Please listen to the customer and pay attention to the order."}
{"text":"Came in to this Jimmy John's on my way back to my office. As usual, I was greeted coming in and the place was somewhat clean.  As I was placing my order (which I've never had an issue at any other place, except here). My issue was over putting Dijon on the bread as well as on the meat, I like there to be enough Dijon for me to actually taste it. The young lady that was going to start making my order refused to put some on the bread, like it was some company policy to only put on the meat. It was a disappointment for me, cause guess what happened? I barely tasted it, as there was hardly any on it.   That young lady is the reason they get 2 stars today (not the young lady with the big ear piercings taking the order). Get off your high horse and give the customer what they want. There isn't a shortage of Dijon......"}
{"text":"Second time here and they still can't get it right. I have only ever ordered the number 9 and they have managed to get it wrong. The last time they smothered it in oil and ruined it. Now, the cashier has issues listening. Ordered a number 9 and got a number 11, really? It's disappointing."}
{"text":"Way cheaper than Capriati's and as good. This place was just around the corner of where I usually work and so disappointed that I've wasted my lunch breaks for months on unhealthy fast food joints.    I'm not a fan of jersey shore, nor do I fist pump in the clubs but my first experience of the \"Italian Night Club\" (sandwich) was really good. You can really taste how fresh the salami, tomatoes, bread were and the red pepper just added a real good kick to the taste of it all.  It's like the jersey shore casts without snookie, because it's a healthy sandwich as well.  Today I tried the LuLu club (turkey with bacon). A good sandwich but with a taste you can definitely imitate at your own kitchen, so it was nothing special.  It was just the cheddar bread that brought a different distinctive taste to it.  I suggest skip this and try something else if you come here.  Service is great. It's like they have an assembly line of workers each dedicated to just adding a tomato, lettuce, and so on.  So it's pretty quick which is a good thing for people who want to maximize their break time in sleeping or talking to their special someone, making kissing noises, and saying you hang up for freaking 10min back and forth.  From my whole experience, 4 stars overall baby!"}
{"text":"I love this place! This location is great. Food is great, always fast and the staff is very pleasant and willing to go out of their way."}
{"text":"I order jimmy johns in the parking lot of my work for delivery because I'm alone and can't leave the store.   They forget to put mustard on my sandwich, which in this case was THEIR error NOT mine.   I called in to let them know because I'm in the same parking lot. I was already eating the sandwich (and I told the guy that) and was just going to see if I can get some credit towards my new sandwich seeing as how I go there twice a week at least?  The gentleman just offered to bring me a new sandwich, never asked for anything he just said \"my driver will bring you a new one when he returns\"  So they bring me a new one and the guy asks for the sandwich back that I already ate? I told him I had already ate the sandwich and the guy never asked for the old one back? and he says \"well that's the way it works?\" And when I told him that the gentleman never asked for the old one back I even said \"at that point not only was it your guy's error not mine, but the old one is just going to get thrown away anyway?\" He nodded in agreement.   So he goes to his truck to \"call his manager\" and says \"we will just give you a credit towards your next sandwich\" and now that NEW one is getting thrown away?  What is the logic in that? I already paid $11 for a 7in sandwich do be delivered 200ft away and now that brand new sandwich is getting tossed or given to some employee for free and I ended up with a sandwich that wasn't the way I ordered it?   In my experience in the food industry you just give the customer the new sandwich.. Your total cost was $2 to give the customer a better experience but you ended up tossing a brand new sandwich instead and left the customer unsatisfied.  I'm giving 3 stars because USUALLY they take care of me here and this was an unusual experience?"}
{"text":"I love this jimmy johns the owner is the best ! I really enjoy the vibe there ! EAT AT JIMMYJOHNS!"}
{"text":"Rude rude rude staff, obviously hate their jobs I would never recommend ordering delivery. Update just found out after canceling the sandwiches .two days later  I was charged 18.46. I called wanting money back to only a store credit possible. Well after being given some number that was to a supposed general manager that the mailbox was full . Thanks for nothing May the original rude person, Cici for being a horrible relief manager and to the Gm for nothing !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever- owner (or age wise you would assume) extremely rude. Would rather go anywhere else but there. No wonder why it was vacant."}
{"text":"i love the sandwiches here. they are so good and they really are quite fast! they are always super nice. my friend ordered chips with her sub and they forgot them, but immediately came back to deliver them even though she was not mad and did not call about them. another time, we ordered from the wrong location and they still delivered to us even though it was out of their delivery range. they are always super friendly and give great customer service. we are loyal customers!"}
{"text":"Good sandwich and friendly staff. The day I was in the music was too loud to have a conversation though. It was hard to order too. I love my music loud but this was too loud for a lunch place where you want to have a convo."}
{"text":"I thought if a sandwich was protein style, the lettuce is usually green leaf lettuce. This is brown iceberg.  I'm super disappointed. And the delivery guy left in a hurry, freaky fast delivery right...I won't order this from here again. I hate to spend money and it's not good. And I was given the nasty, white part of the lettuce! Plus it was super wet like they didn't dry it. While I can appreciate it being washed...the excess water made it gross! Quantity over quality I guess."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Jimmy Johns, their limited sub choices, lack of sides, only one choice for cheese and no toasted or hot subs sucks.  But I must admit that the meat, cheese and bread is top quality. The roast beef with provolone is starting to grow on me.  I still don't understand all the hype, it's just ok. And the music is always too loud. But it's starting to grow on me."}
{"text":"I don't know why I come to this location. The food is good but the service is poor. Today when I went in to order the girl behind the register just looked at me. No \"can i help you\" or anything. When I paid and left no \"thank you.\" She just stared at me."}
{"text":"I ordered a pick up for lunch today and it almost took 25 minutes for it to be ready.  I understand that they're busy during lunch but when I walk in with another customer and he was able to stand in-line, order, get his sub and walk out 5 minutes before mine was ready....Definitely frustrating.  Freaky fast??  Luckily it was delicious."}
{"text":"Stale bread tonight.  There is not much Jimmy Johns can offer and if the bread is bad, it's a total loss.  Bad sandwich on multiple order tonight.  All bread was stale.  Order 06/30 check 132.  Tkr 27213 reg 2.  I would not come back to this location"}
{"text":"Basic sandwiches.  Food is fresh; staff capable.  But I still orient to other outlets for fast food.  The location is easy off from Monaca and that makes the place accessible and attractive. Close to a shopping center.  Better location would give them a lot more business."}
{"text":"Didn't give me a straw or napkins for my delivery and I ordered a double meat double cheese gargantuan. Shit needed some napkins. Delivery guy Dakota was cute and courteous though. Definitely got a tip."}
{"text":"Having moved from Illinois anything with bread doesn't taste as good with the exception of Jimmy John's. I ordered my favorite Vito sans onions and got a Bootlegger for the husband. Super fast delivery within 10 minutes and a consistently good sandwich.   My sandwich was prepared exactly as I had specified and arrived fresh as could be at my door step. I love Jimmy John's for bringing a taste of my home state of Illinois to my door here in Nevada."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, easy. Those are the words that best describe Jimmy John's.  This location is no different. Talking with one of their guys it sounds like they are expanding across the valley. I know I'm hoping for some new locations on the west side!"}
{"text":"I like the food, and especially that they do lettuce wraps of anything on the menu.  This particular store, tho, just as I was leaving, a worker on the phone right next to the rack of sandwich rolls was sneezing multiple times making no attempt whatsoever to contain his sneezes. Gross."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. The price could be a little cheaper but it is a good sub. Certainly better than Subway or Blimpie. The Jimmy chips are unique and very good and a great addition to a sub and soda. My wife and I have tried several of their sandwiches and haven't been disappointed. I sure wish we could get the delivery but we're just out of range. The subs are made very quick and you might still be paying when your sub is completed."}
{"text":"Freaky fast sandwiches but expensive when you make it a combo. My idea of spending $10.15 for a sub, chips, and a drink is a lot... especially for a veggie salad sub.  I was hopping I would easily be able to separate them from the other sandwich shops but nothing about what we had did that. They do make the sandwiches fast and remind u about it on the bag, signs and wherever u look.   One of the biggest 'turnoffs' is the location. It's near a major office center so lots of traffic but the turn off Elliott and the parking lot are just a fender bender waiting to happen. If your driving west it's on the right and your bound to tick off anyone behind you by turning at the 2nd entrance. If your leaving trying to go East, you better have your aggressive driving hat on as it's not easy. A light I believe is coming soon to alleviate but until then, I'll just wait to return. This and all the other food places thrive on the lunch crowd so beware with traffic. Sandwich is made faster than the time it takes to pull in and park!"}
{"text":"Very first time EVER stepping foot into a Jimmy Johns and let me tell you I enjoyed my experience beyond compare. Beats subway ALL HANDS DOWN!! From when we walked in the door we were greeted. And the cashier was very sweet and helpful. Didn't get her name but she wears glasses and the only girl working there at the time with a few other guys. They all seemed like they were having a good time but also working. We weren't even done filling up our large sodas and our subs were already done. The whole time we were there Trevor seemed like a very helpful person and went beyond to help me. Even asked me if I would like just a few extra condiment packets for my subs. Smiled the whole time and didn't mind taking a customer her sub after just sitting down. The store was also very clean and bathrooms were neatly done. Jimmy you have a great team that works here. I hope this review helped."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is not your usual sandwich shop. The bread is what makes their sandwiches so amazing!  It's so moist and delicious. The sandwiches are huge and the combinations they offer are well thought out . My recent favorite is the Hunter's Club (roast beef) on their wheat bread. Their wheat bread is full of delicious seeds and is truly perfection! If you're really hungry, go for the gargantuan. If full of different tasty meats. It's definitely a sandwich to cut and eat over more than 1 meal. The Steelyard Jimmy John's is never busy and the staff is super friendly. It's a great stop for a quick and delicious meal!"}
{"text":"I love it more than subway! They have lettuce wraps for a great gluten free option.  I like the sizes and all the extra toppings they offer."}
{"text":"Not really sure what people have to complain about here.  Fast, clean, and what you expect from jimmy johns.  Takes a special type of douche bag to complain about a fast food joint on yelp."}
{"text":"For delivery sandwiches, I'm totally fine with Jimmy John's.  They are nothing spectacular, but then again ain't so bad, albeit a bit on the small side.  I usually get the Uncle Vito's, add peppers.  And yes, the delivery is insanely fast (figure 10 minutes after you put in the order)."}
{"text":"I think the only thing that could make this place more chaotic at lunchtime is if the building were on fire. Even then, you probably couldn't tell the difference.  I was told the sub rolls were no good so she put me in a 7-grain.... which was $1 extra. They sold me a drink for iced tea (only there was no ice. Or tea. And no plans to refill either). Slightly warm lemonade to wash down my turkey sandwich? WHERE DO I SIGN UP!?!?  Such prime real estate deserves better... Prices are cheap but much better sandwiches around town. I'd take a knuckle sandwich over a Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"My review shall be like their service: Fast.  Good sandwiches done by the time I pay the cheap bill.  Hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"The good thing about this place is they are quick. If you want a sandwich on your lunch break then go for it. Lightening fast, almost no wait for something freshly made.  Everything was fresh, normal depending on your appettie. The prices aren't too high but that is because the sandwiches aren't very big. The quality is much better than the competitors (subway anyone?).  The mayo is great but I could pass out thinking of the fat content alone. It comes in those huge restaurant tubs. So if you are health conscious on any level skip the mayo.  I would come here before other places in an emergency, it just wasn't my bag. But most of that is for me personally A lot of deli meats really bother me so the place leaves very little for me to choose from.  I'd rate this as a fresh and safe, a quick staple quick lunch sort of place. It's clean and reliable."}
{"text":"Go there all the time. Staff is super friendly & subs are great. Love it and you can't beat the price. They are also super fast. I would eat there everyday, and sometimes I do."}
{"text":"The past 2 times I ordered delivery, they have taken 40 minutes to deliver. I have always loved Jimmy John's because of their fast delivery."}
{"text":"So, just now I called Jimmy John's because my food was an hour late for delivery. The very polite girl tells me she's the only one working tonight and she's really sorry but she's overflowed with work and forgot to call me to tell me that her driver had not shown up for work today! So I go in there and see this poor girl with two phones to her ear basically playing the jack-of-all-trades, and was astounded at her perseverance during such a hard night. Her name is Stephanie and she deserves a raise, a t-shirt with her name on it saying employee of the month or at least a cuddle because I am thoroughly impressed with the workmanship and professionalism of this girl. Just wanted to let you know. For a bad day and a big work load this girl held her own and pushed through. Way to go Stephanie!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location yet, but did order delivery.  They are NOT joking when they say it's fast.  It was like 12 or 13 minutes order to door.  That is absolutely CRAZY.  I was able to order and leave a tip (percentage or dollar amount) online, with a super easy hassle free first order/sign-up process... with easy customization of your sandwich toppings.  The subs are good. I may prefer a competitor, but they don't deliver.  These subs are priced appropriately for the quality and they make a great quick meal, dining in or ordering out."}
{"text":"I think I have been in love with JJ's since I was around 19... I used to swear up and down their bread had crack in it since it was so addicting. I was there a couple of days ago though and was saddened that the turkey tom no longer had alfalfa in it bc of the constant problem with alfalfa recalls. Damn e. coli I tell  ya! Gets you every time.  Go for the bread. And the mayo."}
{"text":"I like this place. Every time I've been here I have been treated nice. The guys who work here are friendly and polite. I got my sandwich exactly how I wanted it and it tasted good. For a sandwich shop, I will be back to grab a quick snack here and there.  I recommend giving this place a try. You can even sit outside and enjoy !"}
{"text":"Been to other locations and they are all consistent with their product, customer service, and speed. I was surprised when I saw this location had only one and a half stars but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. The following is my family's experience.   I went on yelp and decided to do my order online, through my phone, for pick up. I created an account, it was a simple process. I ordered 3 sandwiches and was able to customize each one to each person's request. I drove to the 90th st. And Shea location. I entered the drive through and told them I had an order to pick up. When I got to the window he had my order and total ready for me. He was friendly and efficient. When we got home I asked each person if their sandwich was accurate and my son said his was perfect! :) I had a very good experience with this Jimmy John's order and location."}
{"text":"Clean space but subs are nothing special. Management is terrible, store has potential if the workers had a little more life+personality to them...."}
{"text":"I ordered a delivery sandwich from this location for the first time.  I ordered online and it was very easy to figure out.  I didn't have to wait too long for the delivery, and the driver was pretty friendly.  My sandwich, however, was soggy and tasted a little off.  I would much rather just go pick my food up in the future, I'm not sure what happened."}
{"text":"I ordered a Club Lulu and they brought me a crazy sandwich without bacon. I'll let the pictures speak by themselves."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying Jimmy John's tonight. Pretty decent.   Someone else said their subs are only a notch above Subway. I see what they mean, but I would say they're at least two or three notches above. Personally, I like toasted subs better, but as far as cold sandwiches go, these were good. Prices were also fair.   Where this place really shines is in their delivery. They say they are fast, and that is very true! About 15-20 minutes from order to delivery for me on a Friday night. Their store is close, but not that close---maybe three miles.   I'll be ordering from this place again, I am sure."}
{"text":"Solid place. Never had a bad experience from this location. Always quick and on time! When I want a sub I go to this location only."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch today, sandwich was great (I had the beach club with sprouts), restaurant was clean and service was quick and friendly. I noticed that he young man who seemed to be the manager or shift leader was very involved with the guests as well as his employees. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"OK, I was not going to write a review for Jimmy John's but reading the reviews of the \"one star haters\" inspired me. The service was freakishly fast and my sandwich was tasty. It is true that this establishment is run by not so normal kids. But what kid is normal? I loved their enthusiasm! I loved the classic rock music playing!  All you haters have a lot of options. If you can't handle fun, unique, enthusiastic young people, go someplace else."}
{"text":"Every time, people are friendly and the food is fantastic.   The restaurant is clean, and the service is quick.   I could write an essay here, but why?  Go here for the best sandwiches in the area."}
{"text":"My girlfriend & I went to this location last night for the first time & our last time unfortunately. The sandwiches we ordered just tasted plain. No flavor at all. If We would've known the product would be like that we would've just made sandwiches at the house! We saw nothing that stood out about it & the fact that I payed 18 bucks for 2 sandwiches that weren't good really sucked. Not sure what the problem was, but if the rest of the menu tastes like that then I would not recommend this place to no one. Maybe it was just the sandwich I got or something. Maybe I'll try something else on the menu before COMPLETELY writing you guys off. Maybe . But for now, I'm good."}
{"text":"Went to Jimmy John's for the first time Tuscola Illinois. I asked for any condiments for my sandwich to be on the side and they said they don't do that. I looked at him in shock and turned around and walked out. I won't be back."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwhich shops in Vegas.   This place is clean, fast and great.   The bread is almost like a french baguette in texture, crispy on the outside but instead of light in the inside it has a chewy texture like a togo's sandwhich.   Ingredients are fresh and the balance of mayo, cheese, meat is perfect.   Im a fan!"}
{"text":"Have been a big fan for a long time and have always gone in to pick up my sandwiches. Finally had the need to order a delivery and even though I'm only 6 minutes away, they couldn't deliver because it wouldn't be \"freakishly fast\" and she said they feared losing their franchise if it took more than 5 minutes. Clearly, it's more of a gimmick than actual customer service. They only care about the delivery time they can advertise- not about actually delivering sandwiches. Turns out I'm in a \"dead zone\". Jimmy Jons- you are dead to me"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery here last week. I received a phone call from an unknown number but they didn't leave a message. After wondering where the food was after hour and half, I called and they said they dropped it off at reception. I was annoyed because the person could have left a message and there was no one at the reception because it was late. I had another work meeting and I thought it was partly my fault so I ordered again (it is easy for group orders). They forgot all of the drinks! We had to start late because everyone had to get drinks. At this point, I'm not using them for orders for work. I'll find another place for work lunches and dinners."}
{"text":"Crazy awful service. Employees are moving in slow motion. When you only offer a few items on your sandwiches you can't run out of them and not tell your customers when they are ordering. Would hate to see what a hot mess this place would be if they were busy:("}
{"text":"Very happy that they put a Jimmy Johns over here.  We work relatively close to here and now have a great place to grab lunch.  They are very clean, nice size and great service.  My wife and I both got the un-which.  It's a sandwhich wrapped in lettuce for those laying off bread.  It was very tasty and we will be back for more."}
{"text":"All the tables were dirty even though it wasn't busy at all (4:00 on a Sunday). I should have looked at the reviews before coming in the door. Food tasted ok. Surprisingly the bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"When this placed first opened it was great. But now EVEYTIME I order my sandwich is wrong! I usally get vegetarian sandwich. No mayo with mustard and cut in half. Got my sandwich not cut in half. (Really not huge deal for me) but, all I have is lettuce, tamatoe and avocado spread. THATS IT! Should have cucumber, mustard. This has happened too many times. I will not go back again."}
{"text":"The excitement over the proliferation of Subway's less health-conscious cousin  is hard for this writer to comprehend.  It's been 31 years since the first Jimmy John's franchise operated from out of a garage in Illinois. Today, Jimmy John's is almost becoming as embedded and saturated as The House Fred DeLuca Built (at least one other JJ's is located in the same zip code), and it's not an entirely despicable development based on a recent visit brought about by an evening without my Kay. \"Heck, I might as well try one out,\" I said to myself as I casually hoofed it up Grant Street in search of a cheap, expedient dinner.   I did find that my Jimmy John's Billy Club vaults over anything Subway manufactures (I was told by one employee years ago that Subway refers to their foods as 'materials' to be 'assembled.'), but I'm still getting the impression that like DiBella's, something special was lost in the transition from local mom-n-pop gem to national fast-food powerhouse.   My Billy Club (#8 on the menu) consisted of \"medium rare\" roast beef, smoked ham, provolone, Dijon mustard, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise. While the meat was ample albeit a touch dry and the bread was chewy and faux-artisan, I kept feeling as if this was something one could concoct at home with minimal effort, particularly as the mild-mannered proteins slid from out of the grinders other end with each chomp, and I pushed them back in. .   Jimmy John's tries valiantly to trick the diner into thinking he or she has stumbled into a shiny, new, independent sandwich shop. The white tiled walls, gleaming railings, spacious layout, wooden seats, glossy, black takeaway menus with the ironic fonts, and the impeccably friendly staff all indicate a willingness to replicate what a Jimmy John's would be like if the entire chain started up in whatever city you're currently in.   Wait 'til one opens in Grand Forks, North Dakota! Marilyn Hagerty will be in for an experience!   As for me, I was just moderately impressed with their selection which seemingly features the same ingredients in interchangeable configurations. There's the aforementioned roast beef and \"real smoked ham\" along with tuna salad, the usual Italian delicatessen meats, turkey breast...and I'm yawning as I write this. Chain sandwich joints such as these are sapping my patience and interest.    Oh, I had dessert too.  That shrink-wrapped cookie I had was basically a squishy Little Debbie lunchbox treat magnified in size. I'm sure I could find something of similar quality in my employer's row of vending machines.   Nonetheless, I liked that bread enough, and for two quarters per day-old loaf, I almost took some home...to make an even better sandwich for myself.   For me, Jimmy John's just ain't got it goin' on."}
{"text":"First time at this location. My son ordered an 8 inch turkey sandwich with mayo. After making the sandwich he just handed me the sandwich.  I asked for it to be put in a bag. He rudely says \"so you want a bag\". He put the sandwich in a bag and then tossed it to me with the comment \"here you go sport\". Great customer service. When my son opened the sandwich there was no mayo. I've eaten at many different Jimmy Johns and never experienced service like this. Won't return to this location.  Stay away from here."}
{"text":"I made a mistake and ordered to the wrong address. I called Wesley and explained how important this order was to me. Wesley made it happen. I can't thank this store enough for their great customer service!!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't had Jimmy Johns in 3 years and my friend never had Jimmy Johns so he went and got me Turkey Tom with avocado instead of mayo and Pepe on wheat for himself. He thought it was okay because it barely had any meat. I paid additional price for the avocado and there was a dab of it on my sandwich. Thus, mine was dry and boring. Now, I remember why I haven't gone in 3 years."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great manners, and REALLY fast."}
{"text":"ordered the #2 big john with extra tomato, easy cucumber, onions and easy lettuce.  I got the bread onions, tomato, lettuce and a single slice of cucumber.  Didn't know asking for veggies negates the meat that's supposed to be in there.    $6 for a veggie sub.  Never again."}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews- I love this place! Great sandwiches. And a drive thru! Employees work fast and are friendly every time!"}
{"text":"Being that I have to avoid sugars and carbs most of the time, I wasn't expecting Jimmy John's to have anything for me. I tagged along here with my friend for lunch to see what it was about.  Thankfully they have an Un-Wich, which is their version of a Lettuce wrap. It was actually just as good as eating a sandwich. Sure there was no bread, but I'm all about the meat, cheese, veggies, and sauce anyhow.  The lettuce was crisp and held together long enough to enjoy eating the full thing, and it was just as satisfying as eating a sandwich.  I figured that worst case scenario they would have a salad option, but surprisingly they either don't or I just couldn't find it on the menu. In the end the Un-Wich was so much more satisfying than a salad would have been."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and attitude of the employees was poor overall. It seemed that no one wanted to be there, and were very put out to make 2 sandwiches. I wasn't impressed. It was like everyone had just been reprimanded by a manager or something...."}
{"text":"The service is extremely FAST. The parking at this location is extremely horrible... GOOD LUCK. I found the meat portion to be extremely small for a $6.00 sandwich. I do not like any of their chips. This location is very small, and because it is busy, this is a problem. Good luck fining a seat or a place to stand. Be careful stepping over the homeless that sit outside and beg for change for their next beer that they proudly go right to 7-11 and purchase while you are waiting on your sandwich."}
{"text":"Didn't like this location too much...Seems weird where the whole staff is totally eery quiet, nobody in the place but You and not friendly? I ordered their Garganchuan regular size. All the deli meat was sticking out of the bread..buy the time you wanted to taste some of the veggies and dressing, etc. All the meat would just slide to one side...something is wrong here? I've been to the one by UNLV and they're not built that way? I've tried like 4-5 different ones and even this same one and they aren't like That? Idk, but it's pretty dry and not to mention a mouth full at a time and was not very enjoyable. All in all, I continued to finish it off cuz I was famished from hardly eating nothing at all...and it was like 4pm!  (Not a good location, Sub lovers) a waste of $12.00 for me......."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Jimmy John's in general. This location was no different. Stopped by here before heading to the hospital. The service was freaky fast and very kind when I asked to add one more thing AFTER they had already wrapped up my sandwich."}
{"text":"Legitimately \"FREAKY FAST\". If you are uptown, you can call and your sandwich WILL be delivered in 15 minutes. I usually order the Country Club sandwich, as it comes with a healthy portion of meat. On my last visit, I tried the BLT, which turned out to be a poor decision. The bacon was overwhelmed by the lettuce and tomato.   Whatever you get, do it on wheat bread. The wheat bread is regular sandwich bread, (not sub) has small nuts (I just giggled a little) in it, and is a better bread and probably more healthy than the white bread."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It was my first time trying jimmy johns. It was very fresh and tasty. We had the Vito Italian sub and the bootlegger club with cheese. Which is a roast beef and turkey sandwich I had it on the seven grain sliced bread which was very good. However I didn't really like the turkey to much. The Vito sandwich was a little better though. We had that on the French bread. It taste really good. Both breads are good. I guess it just depends on what you feel like eating at that moment. The big pickles was ok not very flavorful. Delivery was great it was extremely fast and she was very nice."}
{"text":"First of all we love Jimmy John's!  We do not, however like the attitude you get from the employees when you ask them to simply cut your sandwich.  Yesterday the guy with long hair gave us a \"uuuugh!\" and said \"I guess\" ..Seriously! ? What the he!! is wrong the younger people in the service industry that just don't want to work these days. Lazy generation that it just kills them to have to do a little work!  The sandwiches are supposed to be cut anyway- incase I want one now and one later (like Subway), not here. I was charged $1.50 last time to have mine cut in 1/3's and husband's in 1/2.  Like another reviewer said everything slides out as soon as you take a bite! You would think they could fix this with the fold of the bread being thicker.."}
{"text":"Talking about convenience! Literally not even a block away!!!! Service is fast... fresh! And great location. Plenty of parking and sister food places in the same plaza. A place to be for lunch or even a quick bite. Menu is awesome ... plenty to choose from if you fancy for some sub. This is a much better place to get it than that other place ( sorry can't say ) . Waiting is not a problem because there is a couple of registers and enough employees to assist you for better services. I will always come back here and I do recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ok, where do you go with your college age kid on $1 sub day at JJ's.  JJ's of course. There was a line out the door but it moved fast.  The staff was well prepared and did an excellent job of getting the subs out. Had the Italian Club.  It was good, with plenty of meat including some capcola, ham, salami and provolone cheese.  Wanted hot peppers, but forgot to ask.  Thought the bun was a little lacking...have had better bread, but maybe it had to do with the early baking to have enough bread for the $1 sub day. We split a bag of chips that were very crunchy and more like kettle chips."}
{"text":"Their food is good. Kind of plain in my opinion. We placed an order online to be delivered-- because the website said we are within the delivery area. 45 minutes later, no delivery. We call. They tell us that despite what the website says, they can't deliver to us, and our order had been sitting there. They claim they tried to call us, but we know for a fact we did not receive a phone call. Just a little disappointed at the lack of communication and the very small delivery area."}
{"text":"Was shopping for shoes and few other items with my teenage kids.  Guess what, teenagers  got hungry...they are always hungry..lol..and recommended a quick sub from JJ's.  While I have never been to a JJ's, the kids said it was OK and pretty fast.  So we stopped in and did receive our subs pretty fast.    Had the Italian Club.  It was good, with plenty of meat including some capcola, ham, salami and provolone cheese.  Wanted hot peppers, but forgot to ask.   We split a bag of chips that were very crunchy and more like kettle chips.   The kids were right, fast and a pretty good sub."}
{"text":"Really fresh food, but absolutely nothing stood out at this place. The sandwich I bought (JJ's Gargantuan) was decent sized, but kind of bland! About equal to Subway without the toasted option."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype of this place. I just don't get it at all.   They have dry sandwiches served on bread that is not moist, but rather more like a store bought piece of french bread. It's totally average at best."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's as of recently. I'd had it in Nebraska a couple of times and was never really fond of it because they didn't have mayo, mustard, etc.  One day, I realized that if you ask for \"everything\" on your sub, it means only about half of what they have and you have to ask for everything you want individually.   At this location, I asked for \"all freebies except sprouts and cucumbers\" which includes lettuce, tomato, onion, and something else. \"all sauce\" which includes mayo, mustard, and oil and vinegar. I then asked to add hot peppers.  When I got my sandwich, it had sprouts on it, no hot peppers, and no sauce. hmmmm  The second trip in, I just said I want everything they have except cucumbers and sprouts and it still wasn't right.  After taking your sub back to the counter and telling them they made it wrong, it ends up tasting REALLY GOOD, however I ordered delivery one time and it came wrong when it showed up at my house, this was especially annoying. It must just be a Jimmy John thing because Blimpie and Subway I have no trouble getting the sub the way I want it. If you go here, be really clear about what you want on your sandwich, and you will really like it."}
{"text":"I always heard people raving about Jimmy John's so I decided to try it for a lunch meeting. I ordered a veggie sub and was disappointed in how bare it was. They offered almost no options and then the thing I was most excited about, the guacamole, was barely there. Subway and other places are better."}
{"text":"So i will say I'm not a big fan of the Bacon at JJ's. However, i will say this The one on Maryland has Free Wifi, and now does 10 subs get the 11th free. So ti is the greatest place ever!"}
{"text":"I really love jimmy johns and most locations are 'freaky fast' as they should be... But NOT this location! Every time I order from this locations it takes from 45 minutes to an hour to deliver (Note that I live 0.7mi from the location). Other than that, sandwiches are real good!"}
{"text":"consistent. bread has been fresh. quick through drive thru. friendly staff. meats and veggies seem fresh. not gourmet. but is great for lunch or just an easy meal for dinner"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Love the convenient location. Never disappointed in their Italian Night Club.  I'm always greeted promptly at the door, and the sandwiches are done what seems like 30 seconds."}
{"text":"This location is in dire need of customer service training and fresh bread. Ordered 2 sandwiches only to get home and learn that the bread was beyond stale. I called the store to let them know of the issue with our order and informed them my husband would return to have new sandwiches made with bread that is not old and stale. When I asked for a manager I was told \"yeah, she's here\" and the employee didn't put the manager on the phone. My husband is heading there now to correct the order and speak with the manager. Waste of gas for a 2nd run...  I don't recommend this location at all. Go someplace else where the bread won't break your teeth and where a store manager will actually attempt to correct an issue."}
{"text":"Once we ordered delivery and I actually got it freaky fast. I was impressed. Good subs, always a nice alternative to pizza delivery or just a good sub shop to stop by."}
{"text":"Sandwich was great and made in like two minutes. Super fast. Super good. Super cheap."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Jimmy John's subs, from any location, really.  This location is very convenient for me at work, though I'm not a frequent customer.  When I get the itch, it's easy to scratch though.  The store itself is usually clean and service is fine.  Not much to report here.  Once in a while we have work meetings over lunch and we'll have JJ stop by with a box o' food for us.  They haven't let us down - always good food, and always on time.  I do like the thick-cut 7-grain bread versus the traditional hoagie roll.  I get the #12 beach club on the bread - it's hard for me to order anything else with this being so good.  The toppings, for the most part, are a bit basic for me.  I'd like to get sliced pickles on a sub if I can, but it's not a topping they offer.  I'm not big on tomato or mayo, so by the time I list my \"without\" requests, I'm just adding lettuce - for the money, I might as well get a slim.  That's why I like the Beach Club - the guac and cucumber add a nice flavor and freshness to the sandwich.  Jimmy John's offers a tasty, reliable sandwich.  If you want to get fancy with many toppings, exotic meats and combinations, there are other places to go."}
{"text":"Our subs were very bland and the bread was actually cold and flattened. I'll stick to Firehouse Subs in the future."}
{"text":"Great place to eat love the sandwiches and the folks are great service is always great really clean rest rooms and store is awesome"}
{"text":"Went inside and ordered twice for takeout. Good stuff. First visit, beyond freaky fast. Second visit, kind of slow. But no big deal. Sandwiches, chips, and pickles are all excellent. The one real negative is that this is the only sandwich shop I have ever eaten at where you have to pay for a pickle."}
{"text":"Returned after six-month hiatus due to no compromise on stale bread. I have been back several times over the past month. Good sandwiches, no stale bread, and fast service every time. Also like the music while waiting (despite not waiting very long)."}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just really want a sammich. Sometimes, your fella is super indecisive about what he wants for dinner, and mentions 4 different places. Sometimes, you decide on a place, and are heading that way, and a brilliant idea pops into your head:  \"Hey...Jimmy John's is over there too...\"  And sometimes, your fella says things like \"Why you gotta know exactly what I wanted?  Jimmy John's it is!\"  I had been to this location once a year or so ago, and used to have Jimmy's deliver at work for a while, but its been a really long time since I've had it.  This location is small, but very clean, and the staff are great.  Quick, polite, and they even asked my fella what happened to his hand (sprained it 2 weeks ago) and wished him a quick recovery.    The sandwiches were great.  I had the #14: The Bootlegger.  This is roast beef, turkey, lettuce, mayo, and tomato, although I always get mine with no tomato, with cheese and oregano.   It was delicious.  The roast beef was really good.  I'd have liked a touch more mayo, as it was just a tiny bit dry, but all in all in was great.  Fella got the Gargantuan, which is just an enormous, meaty pile of deliciousness.  He loved it, and wanted to keep eating, but ran out of food.  This location also delivers, which is good to know, for the days that I don't want to leave my fireplace.  I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"I'm actually kind of surprised to see the comments about poor service here.  We stopped in about a week ago, and service was spectacular.  Maybe there has been some turn around since the negative comments, or maybe we just caught everyone on a good day...  I love Jimmy John's, but we don't eat here very often.  Lack of opportunity I suppose.  Last week, we were in the mood for something DIFFERENT.  No more McDonalds, no more Del Taco (please god, no more tacos for a minute)...my husband says \"Isn't there a Jimmy John's somewhere around here?\"   So, I pulled out my trusty Yelp app, and found this location, a mere 6 minutes from where we were.  We got our usuals:  The Bootlegger for me, with oregano, and the Gargantuan for my husband.   We also applied the 5% off with Yelp check in...which was actually pretty comical.  It took 4 people looking at the offer to figure out what to do with it.  Apparently its either new, or people don't really take advantage of it often.  They were nice about it though, I tried to say that it really wasn't a big deal, but they persisted.    Everyone we spoke to there was very nice.    The food was great.  i love JJ's bread, so much more than other sandwich places.   I would have liked a little extra mayo on my sandwich, but that's just being nitpicky.    We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Never will I go here again. The last 2 times we went there the roast beef tasted spoiled and that is sad as we used to go here all the time. Not sure what happened but now I am trying to find a place that has a great roast beef sandwich."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich chains by far! When it comes to the big sandwich chains in town (Subway, Quizno's, Firehouse, etc), this one is by far my favorite. The french bread and the sliced wheat are both SO YUMMY, but they also make low carb unwiches as well. The beach club with sprouts, avocado, cucumber, and turkey, and the Italian Sub (called Vito) are my 2 favorites depending on my moods. The prices are reasonable ( under $5 for most sandwiches), and the service is \"freaky fast\" as they say... I will say this location is tiny inside, and I wouldn't head over there and plan on dining in with a group larger than 2 ! Otherwise it's the same yummy sandwiches found at every other JJ."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is quick at making a sandwich so if you are getting something for lunch or are in a time crunch, stop by. The menu is simple and veggies are fresh. Bread is super soft and customer service is good. No issues with this Jimmy John's location."}
{"text":"I think it's sad that the place i'm about a mile away from the place and I'm considered outside of the delivery zone... I know guys at the University would BIKE even farther... these guys drive cars... sad"}
{"text":"Jimmy Jon's is okay for a quick bite, I usually get their Veggie sandwich hold the mayo. I like that their service is quick most of the time. But it's basically a better option than subway but not as good as Cappriottis or Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"Awful. Iced tea tasted rotten. I ordered the beach club because it said it came with sprouts and avocado. Got a sandwich w iceberg, turkey, tomatoes and lots of mayo . Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Love JJ's.  Only wish they had a drive-through.   Most times they are extremely fast and I can be in and out in 4 minutes."}
{"text":"They bring us samples often and I always love them, so I decided to order today. ordered a veggie sandwich with alfalfa sprouts on it and it came about 20 min later. They asked me if I wanted it cut in half. ..yes please. Open the sandwich. ..no sprouts, not cut in half, I couldn't even find the avocado at first but eventually did. Not enough to be able to taste it. So I called and the manager said they'll send me another sandwich but to make sure I return the one they messed up. So. ...I'm supposed to spend my entire 30 minute lunch waiting for a seconds sandwich and you want the messed up one bank so you can throw it away? I even had to go get the menu and read it to him the description. He said it must be an old menu. I guess it wouldn't be so bad but it was trashy to all for the other sandwich back or not offer a credit instead knowing I only had 30 minutes for lunch. I won't order again. I don't know if he thought I was lying or is just short on sandwiches, but I don't have time for this"}
{"text":"I'm slightly confused at the high ratings. JJ isn't bad. But everyone raving about the bread? It's average. Yes, delivery is crazy fast, and they are just slightly better than other huge chains, but is that our standard now? Better than the worst?  The workers here are okay - they can be a bit on the rude side, but it depends who you get.  Personally, I'd rather go to a local joint, one that is not being sued for wage theft and accused of making its employees (even drivers) sign unprecedented non-compete clauses."}
{"text":"I waited 30 minutes for my sandwich to be delivered. When I asked the driver why it took so long, he got an attitude with me. I then told him I was going to call his manager and complain. He replied that if I did, he was going to \"Kick my fat a%*\". The driver then proceeded to snatch my ten dollar bill off my desk without giving me the change I was due, throws my sandwich at me, and cusses me out all the way out the door. I complained to the store manager who promised she'd run my money back over to me. After waiting over an hour, her area manager calls me back. This was the only apology I received. He promised quick action. After waiting longer, I called him back to see where my money was. He told me now I would have to file a police report and I was no longer allowed in the store. I called the police who met me there, and after 2 officers insisted, they FINALLY returned my money. You would have to be INSANE to eat at this Jimmy John's. It's pretty sad when all you want is a sandwich, only to have to have a police incident instead."}
{"text":"Ok. Meat tastes manufactured or processed. There are plenty better places. More like college food, if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"I am a fan, and I will be back. Not sure why I waited so long to try it in the first place. I'll take this over Subway and Quiznos any time. Employees here seem to be overly happy. Hmmm... very suspicious."}
{"text":"I don't get all the hype - this is a good sandwich at a good price. Though I like the vibe and the attitude reflected in their decor and promotional materials, but the product itself is nothing miraculous. I gotta say I love me a tuna sub now and they - it pains me to say that lowly Subway blows this tuna out of the water."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Jimmy John's, at least here in Phoenix. I've been to locations in Indianapolis and Chicago and they're great, but there's something different about the restaurants here in Phoenix. It's really the bread. Its almost like I'm biting into a sandwich without first taking off the paper they wrap it in. That and they put A LOT of lettuce on their sandwiches. It's like a salad between two slices of bread. Anyway, based on the food, I would give this restaurant 2, maybe 3 stars, but the service sucks! I went in once to order a sandwich to go.It seemed both people I had any interaction with were annoyed with each other and it just made being there kind of awkward. You could definitely cut the tension with a knife. Now on the weekends I work in a store by myself all day. Wanting to having soething different rather than my usual meal from Windsor I decided to have something from Jimmy John's delivered. Jimmy John's is at 16th St and Camelback and my store is on Central just north of Camelback. According to Mapquest and Google Maps (I checked both just to verify), it is 1.9 miles, or 4 minutes in regular traffic. After trying to order online and getting an error message that I was outside of their delivery area. I figured with as close as I was, this must be an error. So I called and to the most unpleasant woman ever. I explained that I wanted to place an order but that I received the error message that I was out of the area. She snaps at me \"What?\" and I repeat myself to which she snaps back \"What do you mean?\" By this time I'm annoyed and tell her \"I am repeating to you what the message said online when I tried to order. What part is unclear to you\" To which she, unsuccessfully, muffles the phone and yells to someone \"ugh, I don't have time for this, you talk to this guy!\" Two minutes later someone else gets on the phone and explains that they have a 1 mile radius delivery area. Seriously. I wound up walking 1/4 mile to Jersey Mike's. Much better food and friendlier service there anyway. Next time, I'll just go there and not waste my time at subpar places like Jimmy John's. Oh, by the way, another sandwich shop, Correleone's, which is next door will not only deliver to my work, they also deliver to my apartment which is a mile further away."}
{"text":"I really expected to like it here!! I just don't! isn't the same here, The bread is just meh. The shredded lettuce felt more like I was biting into shredded wax paper. I'm so over it! I've given it many chances, hoping the first time or so was just a fluke. but it wasn't. So sad :-("}
{"text":"It is a sub place. It is faster than, say Subway, because you don't get to pick your toppings as you walk along the sneeze guard. The bread is different than most chains, which differentiates them from the others.   If you are looking for an eggwashed(?) bread, this is your place. The meats/cheeses/toppings don't stand out. The speediness does. Napkins and straws are harder to get than you'd think if you are eating inside.   The bread looks nice, and has its uniqueness to stand on - but I don't see this place as a Subway-killer."}
{"text":"This place has horrible horrible customer service!  And this was from the store's manager!  Our office staff orders from them on a daily basis and I myself order at least $50 worth of food when I do so they're definitely losing out on that since I'm now calling the other location close by to place my orders.  I wish there were other places that delivered in my area.  Haha looking at the other dissatisfied reviews for this location it sounds like the manager at this location has major customer service issues!  I'm seriously considering calling corporate...wondering if that would even do anything?"}
{"text":"Customer service was a big fail..The cashier dude just stared at me as soon as i walked in the door and gave me that \"You going to order or what\", not even a greeting or a peep out of him  As for the food, very disappointed! The ingredients taste as if i could have just bought them at the store and made the sandwich myself, Not sure why people like this place. Literally taste like a sub sandwich you can make at home with ingredients you can buy at walmart or fys..Never going here again..I rather stick to subway, bigger sandwiches for cheaper the price  I say just stick to subway!"}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches and good value IMO.   I'm glad Jimmy Johns has finally expanded into the Vegas valley. I have been a Jimmy Johns fan for a long time since they are a big chain back in NE Illinois where I am from originally. When I moved out west here the only place for subs in town were the SubWay's that seem to be on every corner here.  IMO Jimmy Johns blows Subway away. Their \"small\" 8\" subs have more meat and cheese than a 12\" from Subway. JJ's uses much better quality ingredients too. You can really taste it.  With Subway jacking up their prices and skimping big time on the meat and cheese lately, JJ's is a great value. The large subs like the Italian Night Club easily have twice as much meat as a 12\" Italian BMT from Subway.  MY favorite subs are the Vito, Italian Night Club (without mayo), and the tuna (love the tuna!).   I've been to this location several times and have received adequate fast service so far. No issues to report."}
{"text":"Decent price, decent size, great ingredients and great taste. This is so much better than Subway, Silver mine or any other quick sandwich place out here. Good to see this midwest staple finally arrive. Now all we need is good deep dish pizza and Italian beefs."}
{"text":"Great sandwich at a great price. I would consider this an upscale Subway. The bread is much better and you get more generous portions of meat. Always fast service, but with the amount of people they have behind the counter it isn't surprising. Wheat bread is a nice alternative if you feel like more of a traditional sandwich. I would say this is one of the better Fast Sandwich Places. I wish we had a Which Wich here!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches. They do have a vegetarian option which is quite well done.  Mostly friendly service. Wish they had a drive through. That would be so great!"}
{"text":"After a longer than expected wait at the Urgent Care facility next door I was starving! For all my fans, don't worry, I wasn't sick. Just needed a flu shot.  Pretty much like any other Jimmy John's except for the community table down the center. Nice idea for a busy spot like this.  Same sandwiches that you'll find at any other JJ's, just not the same service. I'm used to having my sandwich ready by the time I fill my drink cup. Not here, they are S-L-O-W! And they weren't busy. Just seemed like a group of lackadaisical workers manning the sandwich line today.  The food would get five stars based on what I expect from JJ's. The slow service would get and dirty tables rate one star so I averaged it at three."}
{"text":"This Jimmy John's location is just okay. The staff could use a little more training and they need to pay attention to orders. Several were wrong while we were there."}
{"text":"I love the #3 Tuna at Jimmy Johns and this location didn't disappoint. My rating wasn't 5 stars because: the tables were dirty and nobody bothered to wipe them down, I had to do it myself, however, first I had to find some napkins. They serve iced tea, but no lemons or sweetener. Take care of those 2 things and you'll earn that extra star."}
{"text":"The store and my sandwich were good. The cashier Nikolas was an ass to my girlfriend on the phone and in peraon. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Love jimmy johns! It's a little overpriced but on a good week and a good cravings, it's perfect. The night club is my favorite with extra sprouts. The men there so really need to shave their faces and get haircuts though"}
{"text":"Terrible Service. Took 40 minutes to deliver. Freaky Slow."}
{"text":"After finishing my daughter's hair at the salon in the same center we drove through the drive through at jimmy johns. The order takers name is Stephanie chk#158. She was rude & slow: I even tipped them a dolloar. We get home after a 30 minute communte & sat down to eat my  daughter pulls out a red hair all the way out of her mouth. I joke about us being cosmetologist & randomly get hair in our food. Well This was beyond disgusting. There was a 6-8'' on both halves of the sandwiches. When I called the girl Michele said the manager was in the bathroom. I said I'd hold. Then a man gets on the phone & says they've been having problems with their phones tonight. No one would give me the actual owner/manager names. All they offered me was to bring the sandwich back. That would take an hour of my time since I live 30 minutes away. Besides I wouldn't trust their food now. This is my second time in two months of them ruing my food. They'll never get a third chance from me! Or most of our employees at Posare salon. Big mistake Neessha & Michelle!"}
{"text":"Great service and location. Clean store. Chips and drinks were organized. Food is made as it should and tastes fresh. The gargantuan with bacon is my favorite."}
{"text":"Have to give this place a five because they serve up delicious sandwiches! The best from all of the national chains! I love everything on their menu. Their cookies are also delicious and they keep their stores clean. Food tastes fresh and delivery is seriously fast! Staff is also friendly."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at jimmy johns in several years... I remember why. If you're looking for a quick \"cheaper\" sandwich and don't care for a friendly staff/environment or expect them to get your order right then this is your place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great location, fast service whether you're dining in or ordering delivery. The staff is friendly and the food is tasty. All of the sub varieties taste great and the grain bread is awesome, too."}
{"text":"I haven't returned to this sandwich shop since getting the sloppiest sandwich ever put together by human hands. The toppings were halfway out the bread. It was not appetizing nor hygenically trustworthy. It left a bad image in my mind."}
{"text":"When I heard they were building a Jimmy Johns near my house I was excited. Love their subs. But the experience I've had at this particular location. Bad. They always get my order wrong. And what irritated me the most is when they forget to put veggies on the sandwich that already come with the sandwich! It's happened multiple times. Like they don't have the pics that tell you what each sandwich has on it for them to follow. Or they are trying to be to \"freaky fast\" that they mess up the order. Then the manager says they can't do anything about it. Don't even offer a free sandwich next time you go in or damn even a bag chips. Never going back. They suck and bad customer service. The one on 99th Ave and McDowell., way better."}
{"text":"Wanted Jimmy John's today and we went! I got my usual: Slim 4 (Turkey) with cheese & bacon and Thinny Chips. I think they may have been training someone new because they usually have my sandwich ready by the time I get my drink, but today they didn't have that same sense of urgency. And the cashier accidentally rang up \"add tuna\" instead of bacon, but they still made it right. They put like 6 strips of bacon on it! It was a good sandwich. I think it would be even better if the french bread was warm. I like the Thinny Chips better than the regular ones. Not so oily and very yummy! The iced tea was good too. I didn't see anyone wiping tables and they needed to. Slightly annoyed that I live just outside the delivery zone for multiple JJ's... I'd give this visit 3.5 stars (rounds to 4)."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a quick bite. Got my usual: Slim 4 (turkey) w/ cheese and bacon. I usually get the Thinny Chips to add some crunch to my meal, but I didn't this time and I missed them... Would've been on our way quickly except the guy at the register neglected to put \"no mayo\" for my b/f's sandwich so they had to remake it. Oh well. I enjoyed my sandwich with a little mustard and a refreshing iced tea. 3.5 rounds to 4."}
{"text":"Grabbed a Slim 4 with cheese & bacon. It was ready in the flashiest of flashes and I was on my way!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and came to this Jimmy John's for lunch. There was one person working a register and at least 5 other people standing around doing nothing. There wasn't a long line, but at other Jimmy John's they will usually open the 2nd register so you don't have to wait. Not sure why that didn't happen here. I got my usual Slim 4 (Turkey, add cheese & bacon) with Thinny Chips & an iced tea. It was NOT freaky fast. Probably about the slowest I've seen. I wish the French bread was softer... it's so dense and my jaw gets tired when eating their sandwiches. During lunch we were distracted by a disabled vehicle outside that was blocking the parking lot and other drivers were having to maneuver around it, including us when we left. Below average JJ experience."}
{"text":"This place continues to be disappointing. I was in the Jimmie John's at 850pm Before closing time and they said they couldn't wait on me since they WERE beginning to put things away. They are so anxious to leave rather than wait on customers Before their closing time.  This is a very poorly managed Jimmie John's. I never had this unprofessionalism at other locations.  All the other Jimmie John's close at 10pm but this Jimmie John's  always closes an hour earlier which is NO SURPRISE."}
{"text":"I don't get it, I don't get it at all.  The hype over this place leaves me scratching my head.  The first time I went here, I thought the kids who worked there were super rude, and the sandwich was no better than a subway.  I decided to give this place a second try today.  My mistake.  The sandwich had zero taste, the bread was super dry, and the kid at the front was more interested in drinking his soda and going on break, than waiting on me. I wouldn't waste a dime or another minute on this place."}
{"text":"The customer service at this location is the worst I've ever encountered. The manager Heather is rudest most miserable person ever.  The employees here also like to blast obnoxious music and scream along as it plays.  Like really? Shut the f### up so we can enjoy our food! It's been 2 weeks, still waiting for the owner to call me back!"}
{"text":"Very little difference in the amount of meat you get on a regular sized sandwich versus their larger one. The lettuce is always very watery and makes the sandwiches a drippy mess."}
{"text":"Never never will go back. Ordered BLT. Bland, no taste. Order ice tea.   Asked for a sweetener and lemon for the tea.  Ooooo no.  They don't carry sweetener and lemon. Amazing.  My sandwich needed something for sure.  Ask for Dijon mustard. She wanted my sandwich to put however much she wanted to put. I asked for some to add myself. She said no.  I said can you put a little on a napkin, she says we don't give sides.  Sides.  Mustard is a side? So damn stupid. Place is empty at 12:30.  There is a reason"}
{"text":"My wife had a turkey sub and I had the Italian.     The good: the ingredients seem fresh.                       They are extremist fast.      The bad: The bread is very hard.                      My wife couldn't even get salt                      and pepper. They said they did                      Not have any. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I like Jimmy Johns....but damn their delivery sucks, I ordered a sandwich with extra vinaigrette but got extra mayo. Then I called after having 3 bites and told them my sandwich was made incorrectly, they made it again and delivered it......THE SAME SANDWICH WAS DELIVERED!!! TO MUCH MAYO AND NO VINAIGRETTE (even after I called and specified wth was wrong). I fed it to my dog...  I will go to subway from now on...."}
{"text":"My second time having Jimmy John's and first time at this location. It was a great experience as always. The service was flawless and the food was fresh."}
{"text":"First time coming was a great time. The tuna was delicious and you can have it in lettuce instead of bread. I was highly satisfied."}
{"text":"Service was poor and the guy that was making orders did not understand the concept of customer service.  The girl at the register was helpful but did not know the SOP for the restaurant and this infuced the guy making subs to be rude to us. Then he messed up our order. The other lady working there was gracious and very quick to fix our order. But, they still add the peppers. And my friend found an eyelash or brow on her bread. Top this with the staff rubbing their faces around the mouth behind the line. It was not a great experience and i will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with the bread that they use. I honestly feel like if they used any other bread, I wouldn't love them as much. They're just so plain and average. But that bread, Mmm. I always order online for pick up. It's always ready and the employees are very friendly and upbeat. Customers can be such entitled jerks, I'm not one of them. Keep up the good work guys, I appreciate you."}
{"text":"I ordered their number 9 wrapped in lettuce. I think it's really awsome that they give you the option with no extra charge.     However when I got my sandwich I was extremely dissatisfied. The whole thing was drowning I mean literally dripping in mayo. It was absolutely so repulsive I couldn't even enjoy my sandwich.   \"Took to bite and threw the rest out\". No sandwich should have the amount of mayo that this did. My sandwiches was also missing the Italian vinaigrette. Or maybe it could have been on there but you would never be able to tell with all the mayonnaise."}
{"text":"The only thing that was good bout the sub was the type of bread. Thinnest sandwich I have ever seen."}
{"text":"I eat at different Jimmy Johns all the time and this one was terrible! The lettuce was brown and the poorly cut tomatoes were hardly edible. It's the first time I did not finish my sandwich. I also asked for them to cut it in half and they failed there too. Not sure what's going on but this location did not live up to the others I've frequented around town and the country."}
{"text":"I don't know how I would have survived college without this Jimmy John's.  You can't beat a sub shop that will deliver until all hours of the night.  The subs are pretty solid and always made consistently.  Jimmy John's is the perfect place to be set on a street of bars."}
{"text":"Took my parents to Jimmy John's for dinner recently. This was their first time eating here, which is one of the reasons I brought them. All three of us ordered the Italian Night Club based on my recommendation.  And all three of us were very satisfied with our sandwich. I knew my parents would like the Night Club because they like classic Italian Sandwiches. Plus, JJ's uses Helman's mayonnaise and white bread, which is what I was raised on. The white bread is very tasty - I love it.  They made the subs really fast and we took them to go. The subs are large and filling. I've eaten at various JJ's close to 50 times in the last 11 years. Yeah, I eat here a lot, but what can I say? I love JJ's!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great subs!  There are times when my sub is already made and being handed to me as I'm still getting my change from the cashier.  As you're ordering, the sandwich makers are usually listening and they begin crafting your sub immediately.  They can move a line of customers that extends out the door and onto the sidewalk in less than 7 minutes.  This only happens when they have their best staffers on hand though.  Wide variety of tasty subs, but their menu is confusing.  For example, the #1 Pepe is a ham n cheese sub, which has little meat.  The #7 Gourmet Smoked Ham Club is the same sandwich as the Pepe, but with double meat.  Once you figure out the menu, you'll see that they have the same system for all subs.  Single meat or double meat, but each has a totally different name.  The bread options are 8\" white, home-style wheat or lettuce - yes, I said lettuce.  The Gargantuan is my favorite - huge, yummy sub with everything on it - when I'm not concerned about my sodium intake!  I love fast, consistent service and Jimmy John's gives it every time.  I've eaten at the Euclid Ave location over 20 times in the last three years and the service is ALWAYS fast and the subs are consistently good.  http://www.jimmyjohns.com/menu/menu.aspx"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is so consistent with their business model.  Heck, they're almost as consistent as McDonald's.  I've eaten at various Jimmy John's locations over the years and this one is just as good as the others I've visited.  The sub was made fast, as usual.  On this trip, I ordered the Bootlegger, which is turkey and roast beef.  The bread was fresh made, the veggies were fresh and crispy,  and the entire sub was delicious.    Next week, I'm going to have them deliver.  I really love Jimmy John's subs and I'll be back."}
{"text":"So, I have ordered from this location no less than 35 times in the last 2 years. In the last year or so, I started not receiving napkins with my order. It got bad enough that I started making a note in the delivery instructions to please bring napkins, but they never showed up. I tried calling the manager who promised to send them, but no dice. Sounds petty, but I order messy sandwiches. In the last 6 months, out of 15 orders, I've received napkins exactly twice. Today, we ordered lunch for 12 of us for a seminar we were holding. We got 4 napkins with the order, and no straws for the drinks.  The service at this location is getting worse, and management does not seem interested in fixing it. I recently discovered a Togo's close by. Better food, napkins a-plenty, better price. I'm switching."}
{"text":"I was unfortunately not impressed. I haven't been to Jimmy Johns in awhile so I thought I'd make a stop bc it's near my work. The staff is nice but the sandwiches are weak. They ran out of sprouts which I didn't see the sign but wish someone would've said something when I ordered a turkey Tom bc it's one of the ingredients. I also added avocado spread which was hard to notice. The sandwich barely had any turkey. They really skimp on sandwich meat. I don't know if that's a franchise thing now for how much content to put in a sandwich but I wasn't impressed. Not worth $7 for that sandwich."}
{"text":"The subs here are always consistent. I usually go for the #14 \"unwich\" which has turkey, provolone, cucumber, tomato and avocado on a lettuce \"bun\". The service isn't ever the friendliest, but it's a quick option for lunch or dinner. ***3 Stars."}
{"text":"Ok, this place had ridiculously bad service and the sandwiches were as dry as they get. I actually changed my mind as I was ordering and ask the cashier to cancel my order. She looked at me and said it was too late she swiped my card. Definitely a first. So I was left having to eat a nasty cold soggy bacon sandwich on stale bread....mmmm"}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is a classic textbook case of how to take a 5-star business down the toilet to an average of 1-stars, which almost all of the recent reviews are (and not only for this location. If you read reviews for the other local Jimmy Johns locations they have a ridiculous number of 1-star reviews and most seem to be about the \"freaky SLOW service\".   After ordering from them a few times it is incredibly easy to get burnt out on their extremely limited menu. Sure they have 25 \"choices\" but when it comes down to it they are mostly variations on the same thing with different names. And many of them are nothing more than a sandwich that I could slap together myself in my own kitchen.  But the #1 reason they slid to last place is their freaky SLOW service. Frankly one thing that will set me off about any business is when they make something their primary advertising slogan and then miserably fail to deliver on it (pun intended). We've had a different delivery driver each time we ordered. Only one of them could be considered \"fast\".  The most recent guy was a piece of work. We waited for almost an hour (we live 3 minutes away). The driver passed the house twice before finally stopping on the third pass, then declared that he \"doesn't like driving at night,\" is \"half-blind anyway,\" and couldn't see the address numbers because of the glare from the street lights. I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP!!! How in the world would any business hire a driver who doesn't like driving at night?!?!?  I also think their delivery charges suck. If you order a basic sandwich at $3.59 it will cost you another 49% of that price to have it delivered ($1.75 for delivery). But if you order TWO of the same sandwiches the delivery charge is $2.99, or 56% of your total. Why does it cost you more than TWICE as much for them to deliver two sandwiches at the same time to the same location? This is an absolute rip-off and I refuse to ever order from them again.  I started to feel bad about this point in writing this review and wondered if I was being too harsh. Maybe it was just me? So before posting it I took some time to read the reviews of ALL of the Jimmy Johns in the area. WHOA! They are all mostly 1 or 2 star. Seriously?  And there isn't even ONE single comment from management or ownership indicating that they even care that they are running maybe the worst-rated fast food chain in America?  Note to Jimmy Johns ...  you better get your act together or your store will be just one more vacant storefront in an already dead mall."}
{"text":"Super fast and delicious!  Why wait 20 min in line at Chipotle at lunch, when you can have a fresh sandwich in less than 2?  Their prep line started asking what I was ordering while in line and the sandwich was made before I finished paying. Everyone kept saying, \"Wow, that was fast!\"  In general, I love Jimmy Johns for their fresh ingredients and quirky sense of humor.  Keep up the great work here!"}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's! I really wish they would have more locations in California specifically LA but anytime I'm in Arizona I make sure I stop in for an Italian nightclub and some barbecue chips! I've never had a bad experience from this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is a great go to when you need a quick bite or just can't decide what to eat. They specialize in cold cuts which pairs great with a Coke on a hot summer day. Typically, I don't indulge in Jimmy John's too often in the winter time.   \"Freaky fast\", the motto they live by, does have it's problems. They have a surprising number of employees every single time I'm in the shop, no matter what time of day. But with such an assembly line, specifications particular to my sandwich are often missed and ignored. I have learned at this location, after they have made your sandwich, it's imperative to check to make sure that it has been created correctly. I've gotten numerous free sandwiches because of their errors.   However, when they make my sandwich correctly and to my liking, I'm highly satisfied and would definitely recommend Jimmy John's to anyone who has never tried before.   4 stars."}
{"text":"My wife and I went in tonight, as we had planned a party and completely forgotten to get food.  We asked if we could buy a few sandwiches and maybe get a tray to deliver them to our guests, as they have a 24 hour catering notice policy.  Someone, who I can only assume is a manager of some kind, said, it's not busy right now, why don't we see if we can pull it off.  So, we went and grabbed our other items for the party, came back 20 minutes later, and they had our catered sandwiches ready to go, packaged up with condiments.  Life Savers!!!  I will cater with them again, without a doubt!"}
{"text":"I put in an online order for my director and myself while at work.  We had a VERY busy day full of conference calls and meetings and would not have time to run out to pick up any lunch.  We both had the beach club, hers on wheat, and mine on white with extra avocado and cheese.  They were delivered EXTREMELY fast, as always from the time of ordering.  I think they came shortly after 11 AM, but, again, due to being busy I was not able to get away and eat until about 12:30 PM.  When I finally got to take that first bite...NO TURKEY!!!  I thought to myself, hmm, maybe it was just the first bite, so I took another bite, no turkey again.  Now it was time to deconstruct the sandwich, sure enough, there was no turkey in it WHATSOEVER!!! I basically had a cheese, tomato, lettuce, and avocado sandwich.  Uhm, OK. I need to get back for my next call, so, whatever.  I stopped by my director's office on my way back to mine and asked her if her sandwich had any meat on it and she said, \"TONS!!!\".  BINGO!  I know what happened!  We had a good laugh about it and continued on about our day.  When I had some time later that afternoon I called and had the oh so lovely privilege of speaking with Scott.  Scott is a douche.  I really wasn't expecting much besides an apology, but, Scott was very adamant that he made those sandwiches himself!!! OK, great! I guess Scott doesn't understand the definition of a mistake.  I'm sure he was angrily making our sandwiches (as Scott CLEARLY is not happy with his life decisions) was interrupted, and when he came back went back to the same sandwich again.  Well, after all his douche-ness I told him I would just contact corporate and his response was, \"Good, I hope you do.\"  Nice one Scott, high five buddy!  Unfortunately the response I received was that this was a privately owned store so there wasn't much corporate could do aside from forward my complaint to the franchise owner...figures; with my luck, it's probably Scott.  However, I get my satisfaction in the end by contributing another one-star review to their measly two-star rating.  If I only I checked yelp first........"}
{"text":"An hour for a turkey sub being delivered 2 miles away? Places like this deserve to be out of business. Never again."}
{"text":"First time ordering.  Tuna sandwich was delicious so was my turkey club . Delivery was very fast. Ill be ordering more in the future."}
{"text":"For those who have never been to a Jimmy Johns, the concept is simple - simple sandwiches with a lot of flavor. This is not like a subway where you choose what goes exactly in your sandwich, each sandwich comes with certain things on it, and you are free to add and subtract what you want. The most unique thing about Jimmy Johns, however, is the fact that you can get it delivered.   This particular Jimmy Johns is one of the best I have been to and one of the best about delivery. Typically, my sandwich gets to me in around 15 minutes, sometimes 20 if it is busy. And 9/10, they have the right order. Mistakes happen, however, everytime they do, they strive to make it right which is what counts.   The food is always fresh. They make their bread fresh in stores everyday, along with cut their veggies, slice their meats -- this is all done in stores. I know if I'm getting a Jimmy Johns Sandwich, it is going to be good. Their menu is pretty simple, you have a choice of ham, turkey, bacon, roast beef, Italian meats, and then of course veggie. There are three different \"levels\" that you can get - the first one is JUST meat (sometimes cheese), the second is usually one type of meat and cheese plus veggies and sauces, and the third is usually meat and bacon, or two types of meats plus veggie and sauces. The nice thing about ordering online or in stores is that you can add and subtract whatever you want on your sandwich.   NEW UPDATE!! They just updated their menu (April 2018) to include ranch dressing and now pickles on their sandwich. I tried their ranch and it was WONDERFUL. It is a \"spicy\" ranch (it was not spicy, just very flavorful) and would taste very good with a turkey club. It is a $0.50 up charge but it is so worth it.   I really have no complaints. All the employees are very nice, and they do deliver to JCU. Oh - and they do take those \"funny\" requests (my brother ordered me lunch during midterm week and told them to write Cats are Awesome on the bag  to make me smile, and they did it. And yes, it made me smile).   5/5 stars. If you need a quick lunch that is not fried food, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I wasn't able to even place an order because the person answering the phone thought that ordering from the Sheraton Phoenix Airport hotel meant I was trying to order from the actual airport and they don't deliver there.  After trying to explain a few ways that the hotel is near, not AT the airport and a long hold, he returned and still didn't understand. With that level of confusion I wasn't about to trust them with an order."}
{"text":"I spend a week in Las Vegas every month, and literally live on JJ.  Top reasons Why I love Jimmy John 1) the crazy blond hair guy who I think is the manager rules with an iron fist, (I think thats how they chop the lettuce) 2) inspirational quotes, quirky, yet not over the top. see link  http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dc77k565_120gdz7r2hj 3) mmm, good food"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a delicious sandwich. They play great music and have a delicious oven baked pizza smell. The jjblt is a great choice always."}
{"text":"Ahhh, good 'ole Jimmy. A classic American favourite (at least in the midwest). This downtown location is super clean, never crowded, and offers great service.  I've come here 3 times now and I LOVE to get the Turkey Tom sandwich. It's my favourite and costs less than $6 (or less than $7?). I really enjoy the sprouts inside the sandwich and mayo.  There are so many other sandwich options that are available for your selection so don't be shy, select your choice. I believe there is even a vegetarian sandwich as well. Finish off your meal with a drink, chips and a cookie. I normally bring my own water bottle when I come since I don't drink soft drinks (soda/pop).  Also, they are super fast in preparing your sandwich. You can even call ahead then pick your food or they will deliever it to your location.   Going to Jimmy Johns is a QUICK and EASY lunch idea so don't even think too hard about what you're going to eat for lunch. Get on over here :) Dinner is served as well - same menu."}
{"text":"Ordered online and was called to validate my card number. I read off my card number at least 6 times. The jimmy john's employee couldn't pass for even a 1/10 in competence and was disrespectful despite my patience. The order then of course arrived in piss condition. The drink was filled to the top in ice and the sandwich looked like it was made by a 2 year old. Clearly the employee was disgruntled for some arbitrary reason - get a new a job you jack***. I work customer service and did not give this employee a hard time and would never do so. But seriously screw this Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"The thing that took the longest for me to get my sandwich was deciding which sandwich I wanted! I opted for delivery since I can't leave work. Received the confirmation email and called the store to ask how long my sandwich delivery will take and the very nice girl said \"I'll be there in less than ten minutes.\" My stomach grumbled in happiness knowing that food will soon be on its way. Literally 10 minutes after I received my confirmation email, I received my sandwich. I will definitely be ordering from you guys again."}
{"text":"I remember being a young and modest college student back in the Midwest, I had a friend that worked at Jimmy John's and would give me free sandwiches. One sandwich isn't enough to fill me up so, I'd pay for another one.  I normally get Bootlegger (turkey and roast beef) and Hunter's Club (roast beef). When I'm trying to eat less bread, I'd get these to as an Un-Wich (instead of getting bread, your sandwich is wrapped in lettuce). I usually hate mayo but for some reason, I don't mind it on JJ sandwich.  I'd still have a JJ sandwich once a year just to reminisce on the good ol' days. But the sad part about this location is that they're not big on customer service at all. They're pretty rude and they mess up your order. The other locations in Vegas has better service compared to this place."}
{"text":"Great sandwich. It was super fresh, tasty, fast and well priced. Nice variety of sandwiches too."}
{"text":"If you want a sandwich that'll make your blood pressure go up, this is the place for you. This is the location close to my office and so if I want something quick without having to drive, I end up giving them a call. For the past few years, they've been good at making my blood boil...and I keep giving them a chance. \"Jimmy will change\"...NO! Keep dreaming!  Ordering on the phone is quite painful as their order takers can't hear. \"It's too loud in the store\" yet I don't hear background noise. Investing in a good phone might help. When they write your credit card number/ name/  address/ phone number - they can never get it right.   \"We tried calling you multiple times because your credit card won't go through.\" It helps if you call the right number and most credit cards have 16 digits. This leads to not having a receipt for you.  There were times I had to wait a long time for a delivery when it's only a 2-minute drive away. \"The driver got lost\"...really? GPS for less than half a mile?  However, I do like their sandwiches better than say Quizno's or Subway. I normally get: Bootlegger's Club, Hunter's Club, Turkey Tom. You have the option to just have the meat and bread (Slims) or not have the bread at all (Unwich)."}
{"text":"Friendly service and very clean. As promised, freaky fast delivery."}
{"text":"It's a Jimmy John's. The people who take the orders and make the sandwiches are friendly and efficient. The sandwiches are the same you get at any JJ's, they are assembled incredibly quickly, and the soda machine has been working each time I've gone in. The tables are clean and so are the bathrooms.  For me, that's 5 stars for a sandwich place like this.  Note: I have never ordered for delivery since I live about a mile away and I can use the exercise."}
{"text":"Omgosh these are the best keto friendly sandwiches. Lettuce wraps that eat like a sandwich and doesn't fall apart. Super fresh, super fast, and the cutest manager I have ever seen. Definitely go when Matt's working. Best service of any restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Fast and delicious sandwiches. Always constant in quality and the best service! The store was clean and everyone wash working with a smile."}
{"text":"I kept seeing a few people at working bringing JJ's for lunch. I finally decided to give it a try after recieving a flyer in the mail. Sometimes I go through these phases where I'm obsessed with certain types of foods. Right now, on my cheat days it's sandwiches. I went into JJ's and ordered \"The Bootlegger.\" I handed over my debit card and after one swipe the \"sandwich artist\" handed me my order. I don't know how I feel about that. Although you want fast food, it just gives you that feeling like: \"Was this already sitting here from a refused order?\"   I don't know. I felt awkward in that place. There was nobody in line, and I felt rushed. Plus, one of the employees was just standing there while I was being rung up staring at me as if he was waiting for me to leave. I'd only been there for 2 minutes! Makes you think of those movies where a robber is in the back holding someone hostage and they say, \"OH SHIT--here comes a customer! Get rid of her quick or I'll kill you.\"  While I was ordering I asked if I could have specific stuff like cheese for example and she explained there's only one kind. All of a sudden my sandwich was in my face. It was just handed to me like \"BAM! Now get out!\" No words--no nothing. What if I said I was allergic to something, or decided that I wanted to change my bread choice---or didn't want the sandwich all together. (Then it will be sitting for the next person--haha)Weird. I was a little disappointed by lack of choices to put on my sandwich. Maybe I'm just spoiled by options. When I got home I put my own dijon and regular mustard, some horseradish, onions, salt and pepper. If I have to add my own condiments to a SANDWICH---2 stars only. Plus---they were really weird. Those Jimmy kettle chips were the bomb, tho!"}
{"text":"No phone etiquette, and manager was unavailable to talk. Just wanted to tell them that the bread on our sandwiches was harder than their bbq chips. Turkey was slimy and and didn't pair very well with the hockey puck we were biting into. Will update my review if I hear back from management. Don't want a freebie, just a guarantee that this was a fluke for this location and to be reassured that it won't happen again."}
{"text":"The only person in here and over half of the employees are on his/her phone. I know it's summer time in a college town but you didn't even get my order correct. Very disappointing and will be going to any of the other 50ish sandwich shops near campus."}
{"text":"This is easily the worst location to order a sandwich in the fort mill area. The staff is extremely rude. No greeting as you arrive or smile on anyone's faces. The man who took our order said \"hey what do you want\" when I walked in the door, took our order then walked away with nothing else said. The place smells horrible in general and is extremely unclean. There's 5 teenage employees standing around doing nothing but talking, you would think they'd be taught to sweep or wipe down a booth when they're not busy. Not to mention the girl making our sandwiches had extremely long hair that wasn't in a net or pulled back into a pony tail- DISGUSTING. Her hair is literally just a couple INCHES from hanging into my food. I've ordered delivery from jimmy johns several times (usually once a week), and will never return after physically going into their store and seeing how filthy it is. Please pick somewhere else to get a sandwich before you get sick, find a hair in your food or get disrespected by its employees. I would give it -5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I work for Wells Fargo across the street, and with a limited lunch schedule Jimmy Johns has always came through for me in clutch. I have never spent more than 3mins in the location no matter what time of day I arrived. That is a serious plus.  The subs themselves are hard to mess up, I mean really....If you have something negative to say about a sub from JJ or Subway, just make it yourself...  Thanks Jimmy."}
{"text":"Rebecca made our Gargantuan sub extremely fast and it was super tasty! I ordered after another woman that had ordered 4 sandwiches and Rebecca was multi tasking. She kept a conversation with me while making the sandwiches and was very nice and funny.   Our sandwich turned out great and we got it fast. Will definitely be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"This will be quick.... kinda like their delivery service.  Ordering a sandwich online in under 2 minutes = $5.50. The delivery guy showing up in under 5 minutes = $3.00 tip Enjoying a  quick sub on a hot day without stepping foot outside = priceless!!"}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns and in particular the bread they use for their sandwiches. Unfortunately, the handful of times I went to this specific location, I got what seemed like stale bread. Crunchy and crumbly bread is a sad thing indeed in a sandwich. Hopefully they either start baking the bread like it's supposed to be baked or they need to stop making sandwiches with stake bread."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is my favorite chain sub sandwich place. Vito #5 with on onions is pretty much all I order. The bread makes it.  I usually have a good experience at this location but today they were blasting Drowning Pool's \"Let the Bodies Hit the Floor\". Really? If I owned this location I think I'd be pretty upset with my employees..."}
{"text":"The place was empty.  First sub shop that's told me they don't have pickles. Every table was dirty even tho no customers were in there when we walked in. At least keep your store clean so people can sit without getting sticky."}
{"text":"Junk. Another national sandwich chain trying to sell you \"fresh baked bread\" and \"freshly shredded lettuce\" at \"an affordable price.\" It's so gimmicky (a telltale sign that a business' product can't sell itself). All the employees are supposed to yell stuff when you walk in. And they yell stuff if you ask for chicken. And it's supposed to be funny. They have really simple sandwiches - but not simple in a homestyle, uncomplicated way. No, it's tasteless-white-bread -with-shredded-lettuce-and-a-smattering-of- turkey simple. That's it. Maybe they put some salt and pepper on it. A waste of money.... especially if you consider the Dave's Cosmic subs right across the street (not only is it Cleveland-based, but they actually have some interesting food)."}
{"text":"Absolutely do not go to THIS LOCATION. Such a joke! Long story short Ordered delivery 5 phone calls talked to 4 different people including the manager over an hour later I finally canceled my order and they had a since of relief in there voice when I did instead of trying everything to get my food delivered! Expected so much more form this food chain!"}
{"text":"Called at 9:23pm thinking that since it's close to closed that the sandwiches would be lacking, but was really hungry. I ordered 2  #9 unwiches and I gotta say, they are probably the best unwiches I've had from JJ's. Thanks guys, I'll definitely not worry about what time I stop in."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything to complain about, which is unusual for me. The food is good, the price is fair, and the service is fast and friendly. I downloaded their app and they always deliver within 10 minutes. Very impressed. My only suggestion would be to give us the option to replace the bread with a wrap, instead of just lettuce."}
{"text":"I am really not a sandwich person but sometimes it's just a decent/cheap/easy lunch.  Met friends yesterday for lunch and really enjoyed my meal!   The service was good, the location is huge with plenty of seating, and the prices are fair.  The french bread was DELICIOUS (how people do those lettuce wraps when their bread is so freaking amazing I have no clue LOL), and the sandwich was packed with fresh ingredients.    I kind of customized a menu sandwich and they had trouble with my order (I asked for no tomatoes and they also left out the lettuce) so one star off until they fix the kinks.  But I'll definitely be back for lunch soon."}
{"text":"Lawrence hit the nail on the head in his review. Ryan was a total Richard, as a friend of mine would say, LOL (sorry to anyone named Richard).   We ordered lunch from this location because the location closer to our workplace was impossible to get to with all the road construction happening. I decided to drive a few minutes extra and come here. We ordered and paid online, so all I had to do was pick up my order and be on my way. My friend ordered chips, which were not in the bag. I didn't realize I didn't have them until I got back to our office, which was about 15 to 20 minutes away (lunch break fully over by the time I got back). I called the store and spoke to the manager, Ryan. I asked him to refund the chips back on to my friend's card since I didn't get them. He said that the only thing he could do was put her down for a free bag of chips the next time she came in, which would be never, considering she doesn't live or work nearby. I tried to reason with him and he replied that it's completely against store policy to issue refunds, and that he would get in trouble. I asked to speak to the manager, and he said he was the store manager. So, uhhh, Ryan, make an exception. We don't want to pay for a product we did not get. He told me to call corporate and gave me the number.   Out of principle alone I called and spoke to the area franchise coordinator and she said she'd speak to the store management about better customer service, but could not guarantee they'd refund my friend's money.  Over $1.25, and some pretty crappy customer service, JJ's has lost my business. Not even just this location, but in general.   The pickles are good, the sandwiches are delicious, and there is some very quick service, but I am not a happy customer. This is what happens when you don't do the right thing, Jimmy John's..."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns! They really are freaky fast! I swear, my order is done before I finish saying it. But the last time I went there, that was part of the problem. Got all the sandwiches home and all but one were made incorrectly. Luckily, the manager was very understanding when my husband went back. They remade all the sandwiches and gave them to us for free, and they also gave coupons for next time. This particular location doesn't have a high chair, which is why we didn't just stay in the first place and eat our sandwiches there."}
{"text":"Probably the best sub ever, the hunter. Customer service excellent, will return to try a different option or options. It only been on the east side a few weeks March 2018, but it is so good. Stop by and try a sub or a sandwich, with those tasty cookies, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Freaky fast! Everybody is super helpful & friendly. I work in the plaza & no matter how busy they are, they get me in & out with no problem."}
{"text":"I get delivery from here often but today was upsetting I always get unwich actually the same order two club lulu #16 and a bag of jalapeño chips and that's it I get two well because I'm at work when I order and take one home for dinner most times   Well the delivery driver came in asked for me and I said yes thats me then he said wow that's a lot for one person I said well I'm a fatty I guess..... Are you serious   we'll that driver made you loose my business I'm sorry I get judged for ordering two sandwiches I mean unwich not even on bread that shouldn't even matter I know but I guess I have feeling and well yeah I'm upset   I called and talked to a manager told her about it and she apologized and that was it nothing else I mean I didn't know what to expect I don't even want to eat my food I ordered   I recalled and talked to the manager again  told her how I felt and said I don't even want this food she decided to refund my order and put on a file saying I could receive two free unwichs if I decided to order again  I told her I'm sorry I must have a easily offend soul and she might have a stronger one then I but she said no what happened should not of happened no matter the amount of sandwich  I am truly happy on how she handled this and thankful for just the managers help I will rate them a tad higher"}
{"text":"Always a solid sandwich, and their \"freaky fast\" claim is no joke. I can park, walk in, order and get my sandwich often times faster than it would take me to go through a near by drive through. Good, fresh ingredients.   The four stars is because they recently moved their closing time up a little bit. I get why they did it.... their location is probably not conducive to a lot of late evening business. But it would be nice to have them open a bit later for that late dinner urge."}
{"text":"First time visit, tried the tuna sub which was pretty subpar with tune fish and fixins. Might try again but most likely not. Wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Freaky fast... My orders from here have only been fast a couple times and my last order was my last. The driver was rude and undertrained as he didn't even have me sign my credit card slip when he said \"here's your stuff\" and started to walk away. I told him to let the manager know I would be calling corporate and he laughed while asking \"what manager?\""}
{"text":"Some friends and I stopped in here just before checking into a nearby hotel. I have heard good things about the franchise and I have wanted to try it for some time. We were all leas than impressed. As has been said previously, Subway is better. Very limited sandwich options. Most of us got the roast beef. There was not much meat on the sandwich and, as a whole, it was very bland. The only upside was that our food was ready very quickly, probably due to the fact that all they had to do was put on mayonnaise and meat."}
{"text":"Ok, this story has good, bad and ugly.   First the bad: today was the second time in a row we ordered and it took over an hour to get our food (order confirmation came at 11:50am and still had no lunch by 1:15pm). Both times I called and asked where the order was and talked to people who are obviously not trained for phone service. It was a lot of \"huh?\", \"um\" and \"hold on\".   Now the ugly: Today the manager, J., got on the phone and I was just plain hangry. I wasn't disrespectful but I did unload my frustration that this was the second time in a row we had problems with delivery, and I was about to leave my office for the day without lunch. He stayed professional the entire time.   And the good: J. personally remade the entire order, comped it and delivered it himself within 15 minutes. He was totally sweet about it and made good. Typically when you hold someone accountable they get all crappy about it (especially if one of you is hangry), but he was great.  Based on the other comments here on Yelp it seems like they have some consistent problems. Will have to try them one more time to see how it goes, willing to give them another chance after how it was resolved today."}
{"text":"I have never gone to a Jimmy John's as we dont have them where I live. Upon walking in i was greeted, I advised the cashier Ive never been here before needed to look at the menu. So I ordered a #9. He asked we quickly if i wanted to add a pickle... Umm no thank you. Paid for my meal before i could put my money away ge asked to help the next person.... Ummm im still standing here have not even moved yet. I asked if a drink came with...the answer was no. Umm ok so now i have to wait in line again to order a drink. Really if he would have asked me if i wanted a drink i would have known or at least not rushed me out of the way to get to the next person i could have gotten one. So no instruction what to do next i go to get my drink, a man hands me a sandwiches and says #9 right. Ahh yeah thanks... I cant find the lids or straws.... Look up ohhh wow there they are above the soda fountain... Im only 5'5\" but really?  So i get ready to eat my sandwich and its pretty big, i had to ripe it in half  to eat it, would have been nice if it had been cut in half....  The sandwich it self was good, but the over all irritation of the experience will most likely keep me from returning."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is an interesting place. It's tucked in between the new Five Guys and the Fat Tuesday and they offer Free Smells. So at least there's that.  The staff is exceedingly friendly and always greet you when you enter. You'll also notice that there's basically an entire starting lineup's worth of employees working back in the sandwich mines, to help live up to their slogan, \"subs so fast, you'll freak.\"  I have to say, I'd prefer \"subs so delicious, you'll freak\", but we can't win them all. Jimmy John's sandwiches are thoroughly mediocre. I've been there about five or six times now, and I'll keep going back, because they're very fast, they're next to my office, they're not insanely overpriced, and they're relatively light.  The subs are just fine, but the non-club menu (the left side) is woefully underpowered in the meat department. I surmise it's about 1/8 lb of meat on an oversized sub roll that dwarfs your sandwich and makes you wonder where your $4 went. The clubs are twice that (1/4 lb) and a good deal more filling, but the sub roll is just insane. You could murder someone with this much dough, seriously.  So I switched it up to the 7-grain. Better, but nothing to scream home about. (Like, for instance, the great molasses wheat at Paradise.) The meats are rather meh in quality, and there's just nothing special going on anywhere near these sandwiches. But they're fast, and they're there. So I'll keep going. (We order Sacks every Friday, which is where sandwiches are kissed by heaven, but doing it more than once a week is logistically a pain.)"}
{"text":"Very clean, and very quick service..  In and out in under 3 minutes.  Very friendly staff too..  I'm a fan of the #1, pepe.."}
{"text":"Went in to buy a sandwich for my grandson to take to him at school, asked for a slim plain with just Turkey and cheese, drove to Mahomet to meet my 8 year old grandson and he opened up the sandwich and it had lettuce and tomato on it , my grandson was very upset. You explain to a 8 year old that restaurant's are incapable of simple directions is impossible. I fixed the problem so he could have lunch. I then called to complain to the manager and she didn't seem to care. I will take my business elsewhere when feeding my grandson. Also ordered a chocolate chip cookie and it was not any better than a Chips Ahoy from the store."}
{"text":"Had lunch again with my grandsons because that's where they like to go and as usual more bread than meat the soda fountain area is too tall for any child even at the age of 10 years old to reach safely and get their own drink and we all know children like to be independent just a very poor layout and also check the seals on your cookies we had two that were not sealed completely and the cookies were hard ."}
{"text":"WOW!!! Amazing customer service here. My wife made a large order and when I came to pick it up, everything was ready and they even loaded it into our car. Great Job Guys!!! We will be back"}
{"text":"In recent years I have been in love with Jimmy John's, but over the past two years or so their quality has gone downhill significantly. I was at this location recently and had a less then awesome experience.   First of all this is a tiny location! I had my child with me in the stroller and wasn't really able to navigate the shop very easily. You walk right into the registers to order and the drinks and bathroom and sandwich pick up are all in the back corner. I ordered three sandwiches and asked to have a side of avocado and cucumber for my baby to munch on while we enjoyed our lunch. I was told by the manager/ owner(not sure) that he does not buy containers to \"keep his overhead down\". Sure I understand but you should have a side option and charge a little extra (I wouldn't mind paying) for the little cup to appease the customer. Not having the option at all kind of bothered me. I finished ordering and waited for my sandwiches in the back corner. While I was waiting I watched them assemble my sandwiches. Basically they put three slices of meat on and then fill it to the brim with lettuce. I asked for avocado on one of my sandwiches but they put it on all. It wasn't really a problem because the amount of avocado was pretty pathetic! Every time I have been to JJ's I have asked for sauce and then asked for an extra side of sauce because it tastes good. Well since this place doesn't want to have happy customers and just want low overhead I had to eat my sandwich dry.   A few years ago JJ's was much better then Subway and Port of Subs, but today it isn't. Not sure I'll be back. If I'm in the area and want a sandwich I might have to."}
{"text":"Typical Jimmy John's...no complaints. Plenty of seating inside. This is in a great location though - in Bakery Square surrounded by shopping and coffee. What more could you need in one stop! Lots of parking in Bakery Square and also the garage if you plan to stick around for a while which is free for the first few hours."}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich from this location and I had a dead FLY in my sub! NEVER GOING TO JJs again. Even worse, I called to tell them about it and the kid who answered said \"gross!\" And put me on hold to get the manager and manager was so rude and disrespectful and didn't offer me my money back or an apology to make things right. Disgusting and rude!"}
{"text":"First time ever here and was very pleased with quality, taste, and prep staff all very good. I like the fact you can get a 16\" size, my sub place of choice from now on."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food gets delivered super fast and everyone is really nice when you're actually there or over the phone. Even the delivery guys are really nice. They always compliment the garden... Lol. GET THEIR SALT AND VINEGAR CHIPS! They are absolutely amazing"}
{"text":"I don't make many reviews. But those with poor customer service should be exposed.   I made an order st 10:42a today. While I can appreciate an influx during lunch, I made sure to order early to avoid such a delay, even including a tip on my checkout.   I made my first call to the store at 11:18a. I was put on hold immediately only to be attended to 2 minutes later. After explaining that I had made an in-app order and was just checking on my order (Store is 5 mins away), I was told that the driver had left with my order 20 minutes ago and so it should be there within seconds.  I made my second call to the store at 11:34a. Again I was immediately placed on hold. Returning just seconds later this time, I was quizzed delivery or carry out. After explaining that I had called ten mins earlier about my order, the gentleman on the phone, while polite, was quite curt in reminding me that the driver had left 20 mins ago and my order should be arriving soon. He also mentioned there was a lot of orders at the moment. When I exclaimed that I had ordered an hour prior to that at 10:42am he said that didn't matter. And then was there anything else he could do for me. Sensing this person did not want to extend any level of patience to me, I politely thanked him and informed him I'd relate the rest of my dissatisfaction online. He said that would be fine and terminated the call.   Jimmy Johns is a brand and that brand right now is freaky fast. Customers have come to expect a level of service consistent to that brand. In my opinion this experience was NOT freaky fast. While polite, the employees had long the phone offered no or little patience and certainly no resolve. Since this is simply a review with a ranking, that is what I've done. Reviewed and ranked."}
{"text":"You know, for what it is- this place is pretty good. I'd take it over subway, but barely. The whole wheat bread is awesome though- I've even paid for a few slices to take home once.  They do stand out in that they are FAST. No really, like super fast. When I was going to school in Tempe and only had a 30 minute lunch break, I knew I could call ahead while I was getting in my car, and by the time I drove 1.5 miles there, it would be ready and waiting. Beware- during lunch times it can be tricky to find a seat.   I wouldn't go out of my way to go there, but when it's around and convenient, it's a good option."}
{"text":"Always fast, clean, and the service is always good. I couldn't wait for this location to open so I could have fresh sandwiches delivered to me on matter of minutes. I'm definitely a sandwich lover and I love jimmy johns whole grain wheat bread as opposed to their white. Keep it up JJ crew!"}
{"text":"Sign on door Fresh Baked Fresh sliced fresh made problem are bread was very hard the meat on my turkey Tom was very skimpy my girlfriend had the 11 and was stacked well but again the bread was hard.When your known for something like great bread please don't give some old hard crap to your loyal customers it's the first time ever I had a bad sandwich at jimmy johns ."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their food, and overall every Jimmy John's I have been to stays consistent with what they offer, the taste of their food and how it's made. You would think that's typical; however I have come across companies that one store is very different than the other. Their customer service is fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Love jimmy johns  I come here very often and I also ordered for delivery it's superfast and very one is very nice love that it has a drive thur .."}
{"text":"I've been hooked recently on JJ's after initially not liking them so much.  It wasn't until I got a gift card around Christmas that I gave them a second chance lol.  I like the Bootlegger Club and JJ Gargantuan mostly.  I usually add cucumbers, bacon, extra mayo and other extras to make them a little better.  They really do have fast service!  Can only complain they got my order wrong once for delivery.  This location is very convenient for me.  I like all the funny signs on the wall inside.  Workers are usually pretty friendly.  I think the bike delivery service is stupid, but that's just me lol."}
{"text":"Jenny V the manager at jimmy johns is a joke.  These people are ridiculous, there was 5 people working and not one greeted us. I had to get their attention and when I did and I had a question everyone decided to answer.  Asked for peppers and they couldn't give me any on the side, they asked to bring my sandwich which I already started eating so I went back to bring my sandwich and after 2 people touching it I finally got the peppers in a piece of paper. I asked for the manager and the actual person that touched my sandwich and said that we couldn't give it in a cup was the manager, it was a joke. Will never eat there again or any Jimmy John's"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's gourmet sandwich shop is without a doubt one of the best places to get a sandwich.  Major key components to a great sandwiches A. fresh ingredients B.  great bread and C. A wonderful staff that are friendly and provides excellent customer service.  Freaky fast,  freaky delicious, freaky fresh and freaky great place to eat!"}
{"text":"The Camelback Jimmy John's location is 1 mile from my house but after dozens of visits over the last couple years I'm willing to drive further to other locations because of the poor customer service. I have never once even been given napkins for any visits. NOT ONCE . I have to walk back, reach behind the counter (since they don't put them out for customers) and grab my own. We ended up going to the McDowell location and was blown away at the excellent customer service, the smiling employees, the fact that they OFFERED napkins without hesitating."}
{"text":"Since when is is OK for the proprietor to decide whether or not the patrons can or cannot have sugar for their ice tea!?  Unreal the staff told us the owner didn't want sugar in his establishment. Not even sweet tea!! Really. I was FORCED to walk over to Panda Express to get sugar. I am positive the corporate office wouldn't approve, which is why I'll be calling them! There are too many other choices locally to ever go back to that restaurant. The owner is an idiot!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered Jimmy Johns 3 times, first time I ordered it took over an hour to get my sandwich. My coworker ordered a sandwich 30 mine after me and got his before mine somehow. Second time took about 30 mins, decided to give them one last shot today took 30 mins to deliver my sandwich called the store and the driver was only delivering my sandwich and the store is 5 mins away yet still took 30 mins to deliver even the store admitted the driver was out for a long time. Good food but go in and order. Don't have it delivered"}
{"text":"Love the Beach Club sandwhich.. light on the tummy and perfect for a sunny summer day"}
{"text":"Ordered for a delivery and some guy pulled up on a bike gave me a bag and left and when I opened the bag he only gave me a sandwhich and I ordered A sandwhich, extra pickle and chips and I called and told em and they didnt do shit for me; so seriously fuck this location; fuckin rip-off."}
{"text":"Great sandwich for a only 3.99!! That's the way to go. I feel bad for cousin subs. Looks like that place is going to go with there overpriced sandwich !this place is much more fresh looking!"}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Johns but I work in the building right next to this place and I'm gonna go out of my way to avoid it now. That's bad. I've gone in twice and it angers me what I see. I passed a csr guy just hanging out in the parking lot before coming in-he sat right where the customers should be sitting, directly in front of the pick up area. There's a ton of inappropriate shouting for the space and when I went to the cashier no one was stationed there. When I asked for mustard-if it's delivery it's been put right on my food. Here? They will give me packets and I have to put it in my food. They took care of a bunch of deliveries before they got to the in house customers. They don't stick your sandwich in a bag-they make you reach over the counter and grab it yourself-I had to ask them to bag it for me then I realized they forgot those mustard packets-he attempted to drop like 4 or 5 packets right into my hand. Then I realized I needed a napkin-not in a public  place so I had to again reach over the counter. How much time and effort could be saved if they treated in house customers like delivery customers and bothered to put sandwich napkin and packets in a bag when initially handing me my sandwich, putting napkins where customers can get to them and having one of those people lazing about waiting for work manning the customer service register? It just seemed like I was completely an afterthought-not to mention that in such a narrow walkway the csrs should be lett my customers got through first-nope I the customer had to wait for the male employees they barge through. Just a terrible rude experience. Like that the first time seems to be the standard. Don't go here, go to another store and jj-treat your customers better who walk into your stores"}
{"text":"Slowest Jimmy John's I've ever been to. And by that, I mean that after I placed my order and walked around the counter, my sandwich was not ready. I guess the 15 second sandwich luck had to run out sometime for me.  Anyways, fast and friendly service still. The store was clean with plenty of parking outside."}
{"text":"I have used this Jimmy Johns for both pick up and delivery, and I have to say that I don't know how it got such a bad reputation. Whenever I get delivery they are always fast and very friendly. As for when I went to pick up an order, they were very courteous and respectful. I have tried a number of sandwiches and enjoyed all of them. My recommendation would be to try it out for yourself."}
{"text":"For my money, Jimmy John's is the best of the chain sub shops.    I usually get the Italian Night Club (#9) as an \"un-which\".  For the uninitiated, an un-which substitutes the bread for a lettuce wrap.   A great way to pick up lunch without the carbs or gluten."}
{"text":"Turkey sandwich are great here and they make it super quickly.  Its much better than subway although that is not saying much nowadays."}
{"text":"Tried to place an order today for delivery and asked for the lettuce on the side.  I have ordered a sandwich in the past with lettuce on it, by the time it reached my house it was a soggy mess and completely unappetizing.  I was told they cannot put anything on the side due to company policy.  Major disappointment.  Won't eat there again. I gave it a second chance and they failed me again. I'm done."}
{"text":"Nothing like incompetence.  I ordered Jimmy John's for my roomie.  A half hour later, I called to find out they had no order for me. 30 more minutes later, the food finally arrives.  They gave a story of not having enough drivers.  The Academy Awards are today. Management here says they will staff up next Sunday.(when there's nothing going on...lol). People like this want $15 an HR?  My apartment is less than ha!f a mile away.  It shouldn't take one hour.  Half an hour at best.  THAT'S what I get for giving them a second chance."}
{"text":"Starving on a Friday and craving carbs, I decided to order from Jimmy Johns unsure if they would be able to deliver to my location. They exceeded my expectations and more! I love their service and was treated very courteously over the phone and got my sandwich quickly! Now, I'm going to stop typing and go eat my delicious sandwich before I gnaw my own arm off..."}
{"text":"They are delicious and fast!!  Literally they will deliver within 15 minutes of me placing my order online!  Great app too!!!"}
{"text":"I was actually kind of shocked to see such a low rating for this place, but I've never gotten delivery and that seems to be the culprit for low reviews.   I come here frequently for my lunch break and they are always insanely fast. Seriously. I've never waited more than a couple of minutes and I've never had a botched order.   I like their sandwiches too. Sure they are more on the basic side, but the bread is awesome and again they are FAST! I've always found the people working here to be friendly too. With prices everywhere going up, $6-7 for an 8inch sandwich seems pretty reasonable to me. I'm always full and content after."}
{"text":"What you expect from a jimmy johns. The location was clean and the staff were friendly. We ordered and our sandwiches were made in no time. Order was correct and meal was delicious.   I got the hunters club (roast beef and provolone) and it was on par with other stores. There isn't a whole lot more to say except it's reliable and I had no issues with my experience.   It's a pretty spacious store, plenty of seating and room for groups. It also has a drive thru which is pretty convenient."}
{"text":"@jimmyjohns #1694 8320 N Hayden Rd.  Worst experience ever.  I ordered online, 4 sandwiches, 4 bags of chips.   Store is 3 miles away.  It Took 30 Minutes forgot all the chips but one bag, called back said the manager would take care of it.  Put me on hold for over 10 minutes, finally hung up, called back, line constantly busy signal.  Then before finishing listening to me, manager said they were too busy and hung up on me.  All sandwiches were wet, soggy and awful.  VERY RUDE STAFF!!!"}
{"text":"Actually rather dissapointed with my experience.  I work at the hotel down the road and order for the whole office all the time..Im a huge fan of JJ. However, today I went to pick up an order up vs delivery because I wanted a little sunshine/drive to break up my work day..had I known I wasn't even going to be greeted or treated the way I was I probably would have done delivery or just not ordered at all. I asked if I could split the order since I was picking up the order for 2 of us in the office. The girl snuffed and said she already rang it in and she couldn't do that. I said okay...and she took my card for full payment..she just sat there with my card after swiping and didn't say a word to me, just stared at me. I asked if it came with a drink or anything and she answered plainly with a \"no\" and I said that's fine but can I get a drink too?  She snatched my card again and placed a cup in front of me. Awkward! Not going back inside that place anytime soon. That's too bad."}
{"text":"I ordered catering twice from this location. First time it was incorrect, I called and explained. No problem. Gave them a second shot the other day, wrong AGAIN."}
{"text":"Awesome price for a HUGE sandwich. The #12 Beach Club is the BOMB! Fast service :)"}
{"text":"What can I say..... I just love this place and they deliver!  Turkey Tom #4 is my thing."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this JJ several times for delivery. At first, it was pretty fast. This was early 2014. Then as the year went along, I'd be waiting at least 30 min each time I ordered. One time, I waited about hour - no sub delivered. Called, and the person curtly said \"we're busy today\", and that the sub is about to be made. No apology. Another hour goes by, no sub. I call, and this person is a little more apologetic but no promise the sub would be ready soon so I canceled the order. This is where you usually offer a gift card or something...  I have waited an hour for my sub a couple other times."}
{"text":"Decent subs. Always fast and always consistent. A little pricey for what you get in my opinion."}
{"text":"Always fast, clean and delicious!  Very polite employees too!  We feel good about eating here!"}
{"text":"Crazy fast. Decent sandwich but better than subway or jersey mike. The bread is good, sandwich could use more meat but overall good. And did I mention it was really fast? I had my sandwich before I had my change and receipt. If you are looking for quick service and a good sandwich it is a good spot."}
{"text":"Never call for delivery from them... rude as hell and don't care about anything. Called at 7:16 pm for a sandwich and had to give my info and address three times and called again at 7:50 to check on it as it had not arrived yet; different guy told me that they had got the address mixed up, mind you I have ordered from them 5 times at least. Guy then told me that he had tried to call me to confirm and never got a call from them during the 34 min period. Still don't have it now."}
{"text":"Always fast and friendly service here  and I would recommend to anybody who likes that sort of thing lol but seriously I would highly recommend. I usually order for delivery when I'm working. and it is very convenient."}
{"text":"This place is fast! They're just what you would want from a sandwich spot. Many options for toppings and protein. They take out orders with a quickness and they deliver! My only tip is that They're  usually a little light on the spreads so ask for extra."}
{"text":"Jimmy johns charges way too much for a simple sandwich when you can go to a competitor sandwich shop and spend $2 less minimum for a small sandwich, chips and soda."}
{"text":"I order from this jimmy johns often... however they are no longer freaky fast... last 3 orders have taken over 45 minutes to deliver.  I put in the tip online when paying in hopes of them seeing my generous tip however that doesnt speed them up.    I am done spending my money here."}
{"text":"I'm .2 miles away from them, just on the other side of the freeway and they refused a delivery. Just take the delivery sign off your window!!!!"}
{"text":"Really fast delivery and good custom options. Not bad but not the best sandwiches I've eaten. (Note: I am from Boston, where subs are much better than anywhere else in the US)"}
{"text":"I really hate complaining but man. My delivery took over an hour to arrive to my house and on the \"special instructions\" for delivery I asked that they not ring the door bell when they got here. So of course the driver did ring the door bell and now my baby is awake. On top of all that my bag and my sandwich smell strongly of cigarette smoke! To the point I don't really want to eat it. I called the store to let the manager know but he didn't care. He said he'd speak to the driver but didn't offer to refund me or add a credit or anything. I just expected more."}
{"text":"Used to frequent this place when I lived in Arizona. Fast delivery and even better sandwiches. Love the beach club."}
{"text":"Just like all Jimmy Johns, freaky fast, friendly, and taste amazing. I'm seriously obsessed with the Pepe unwich. So so so so so so so good. I wish Jimmy Johns would replace every McDonalds on every corner."}
{"text":"Freaky Fast and Freaky Delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of JJ's. I work nearby, and it seems like my order is almost always wrong. If the food was good, I'd suffer through the incorrect orders, but it's just not worth it. I'd rather have Subway. At this point, I'll only order JJ's if there I'm starving and I have no other option.   I would have given the review one star, but they have some of the nicest delivery people I've ever met. They are always friendly and patient."}
{"text":"My wife loves this place and hates subway. The food does seem more fresh here. It is a bit more expensive but the subs are huge and packed with goodies, so the price is with it. Overall I have to agree it is better than subway. Plus all the funny little sayings posted everywhere is amusing."}
{"text":"This place is exactly 1.1 miles away from my house, and they refuse to bend the apparently stringent delivery rules. Subs so fast you'll freak, my ass."}
{"text":"This place is similar to a quizno's or a subway.  I tend to like jimmy johns more though because the overall menu is a little different than average.    I recommend the Vito sandwich!  It has all kinds of deli meat and cheese on it and I enjoy the light vinegarette that comes on it as well.  Delivery truly is freaky fast!  They will be anywhere in 10-15 minutes of ordering.  Online ordering is also a breeze!"}
{"text":"I work at a doctors office and we sometimes only get 15 minute lunches. Jimmy Johns likes to pride themselves on freaky fast however the last couple times we ordered it took more than 30 minutes to get our order delivered. We end up missing lunch and rarely getting to eat. No one calls and lets you know it'll run late. Even when we track the order on the website it says it's been out for delivery for 20 minutes. Makes no sense. The food is great if you have time to wait for it."}
{"text":"The stink of a monopoly position as the only sandwich spot adjacent to the convention center lingers over this JJ's, where they didn't even bother asking me for any preferences on my sandwiches but just served them up as is. So if you like white bread and the default sandwiches, maybe no problem. They do have the virtue of being extremely quick, which (barely) saves this location from a two-star rating."}
{"text":"Is this a 5 star boutique sandwich shop? No. Is it a 5 star Jimmy Johns? You betcha.   I'm not a big reviewer of chains nor have I ever done a mobile review (I'm big on length), but as a very regular customer here it almost hurts my feelings when I see it getting slammed as I check in. I come in and order to go, I get delivered to my house (all hours) and get it delivered to my office.... I think this gives me some insight.   They have never messed up my order (knock on wood).  Repeat, never messed up. Trust me, I'm not a \"uhhh just give me the number 1 however it comes\" type of person. I am an annoying special order person, even when I mix it up. I'm not sure what more you could want from a chain delivery sandwich  place but what you ordered, in a timely manner. It's also clean in there & everyone is friendly. Again, never messed up my order... That's all that really matters LBH.   Protip: if you want a sandwich for lunch, don't expect lightening fast delivery. This is a jam packed business dense area.  Be prepared to wait some orrrr call early and beat the rush. I have ordered at all hours and notice this is the only time It's not freaky fast, so I adjusted."}
{"text":"I'm gonna give this place 5 stars just because the sandwiches are consistently always good and the staff seems very well trained how to prepare sandwiches. The inside is clean and nice to sit and relax . The staff is very dry not real friendly but that's ok they make up for it with s great sandwich! They have delivery of course"}
{"text":"Pretty fast friendly service and a nice variety of sandwiches. Very friendly staff helped me make my decision considering I've only ate here a couple of times . You must try the hot peppers on your sandwich very tasty. Nice clean comfortable setting for dine in and they deliver of course which is their trademark! Kudos Jimmy Johns"}
{"text":"Everything about this location rocks, except the girl that took my order. Kari I think. She was beyond rude and didn't smile once. I asked her a question and she rolled her eyes and sighed. Super rude.  On the bright side my sub was amazing as always and everyone else there was super nice."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Jimmy John's.  For years I've seen the commercials that focus on the super fast delivery service and I'd wrongly assumed this meant fast food-like offerings. What a shock.  The sub was really incredible.    I ordered the foot long Vito.  The bread was superb.  So fresh and just the right texture.   The meat seemed to be of a high quality and I loved whatever sauce they have used in the preparation.    I ate half of the sub for lunch and the other half later in the day.  I really appreciated the cool box the meal came in.  I was just as happy with the second half as the first thanks to the box and wrappers.   The only negative I can think of at this point is the sandwich was so amazing that it might take me months before I try another type sandwich.    This operation really needs to re-think their ads and commercials.  I stayed away for years because I thought the food was fast crap.  The \"Fast\" needs to be considered after the \"Awesome\" has been taken into account.  I love Jimmy John's.  I give it the highest recommendation possible for so called fast food.  I can't wait to order again."}
{"text":"The sandwich was fine and came quickly but I was really disappointed with the nickel and dime policies of this establishment as I was charged 25 cents for a cup of water.... I will not be giving this jimmy johns my business again."}
{"text":"mmmm.. probably the only JJ's i've ever seen attached to a gas station.  That alone turned me off a bit, but I wanted Jimmy Johns.  The service was pretty good and the sandwich was adequate... but its in a gas station."}
{"text":"The people that work here are super rude. My husband and I went in to order a couple sandwiches. We wanted the Italian but the peppers on the side. Every other location we have been to has just wrapped them up and there was no problem. They have got to be the rudest people ever. They just insisted \"No, We don't put things on the side. No. We aren't going to do that.\" Just real mean the whole time. So we won't be back and it was our first time there."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, fast delivery.  Call don't order online for the quickest delivery. I have had an issue with an order once and they took care of ot quickly."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this Jimmy John's location finally opened. Delivery was finally an option for our office. It was a good run but over the last several months things have gone down hill. Orders were repeatedly wrong - missing chips or cookies or the wrong drink or no straws or a combination thereof.  Sandwiches are inconsistent, ordering the same thing twice in a row and they are always a little different - from amounts of condiments to what seems to be the more common occurrence of 1/2 a head of lettuce filler.  Then \"freaky fast\" deliveries started having times of over 30 minutes. Once at 45 minutes I called and the rude woman who answered the phone told me I would get it, but they were busy - which would have been fine if people in the same building who ordered after me weren't receiving those orders, or even if I had received an apology it would have been better than her attitude.  After awhile of getting delivery in the office we realized that online prices were $1 higher than in store prices. It is a clever way of charging a delivery fee without advertising a delivery fee... Until a group realizes that their order just resulted in a $20 delivery free.  The final straw and why I will not be JJ's customer anymore is simply because of their recent price increases. Sandwiches raised by about $1.25 with other increases on side items. Word is that the increase was due to the passing of a law to raise minimum wage. OK I get it, but my wage didn't increase and with the increase of prices, tips, etc means over $15 for a mediocre sandwich combo at lunch is ridiculous.  The only downside to my life is that I need to be better about ordering lunch from other providers with a little more notice.  Goodbye JJ's... it was a decent run."}
{"text":"I love jimmy johns! Way better than other fast sandwich restaurants. Just had a bad experience though. I always order the Italian night club with hot peppers on the side. This location though the cashier refused to give my peppers on the side! Is it that hard to put some peppers into a cup? I don't think that's too much to ask for..."}
{"text":"Screw this location. I like Jimmy John's, and this location used to be good, but not anymore. Delivery takes up to an hour and I live less than 5 minutes away. Once waited an hour for the wrong sandwich, so I had to drive out and get the correct sandwich anyway. The bread is hard as a rock more than 50% of the time and the staff is usually not very personable. I give up."}
{"text":"I asked for EZ mayo....ended up being covered in it. Ordered EZ oil and the sandwich was soaking wet and greasy. The delivery also took much longer than expected. This will be my last time ordering from this location"}
{"text":"Love this place...so much so I would have a sandwich flown in from the east coast before they finally opened in LA."}
{"text":"I have only been to one other Jimmy John's, and I didn't care for the experience. I figured I would try it again. Still don't care for it. This location is clean and the service was fine. But the subs are mediocre. Not a lot of options for toppings and no sauce options outside of mayo, mustard, and vinaigrette. Lots of other places I would rather get a sub."}
{"text":"I always order from this location.  The staff is always super friendly. It did take longer to recieve then usual but that wasnt the problem. When my order finally came, it was all lettuce. I ordered the club lulu not the veggie. There was barely any meat. When u pay almost 9 bucks for a sub there should be enough meat to know its turkey. Dont think i will order again from here."}
{"text":"This location has the best service. When they take your order they are always friendly and their delivery people are very friendly too. I work near by so it's always nice to know that I can count on a good sandwich with awesome customer service. I would recommend ordering from here!"}
{"text":"Meats and other toppings on Italian sub I ordered at Jimmy John's on Coventry Road were fresh and flavorful.  Bread, while fresh, was not particularly flavorful.  Counter service is friendly.  Coke is bubbly.  Value is good.  Worthy addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My blurb to corporate today:  Ok.. I am a huge Jimmy Johns fan. I have been since you came to Arizona. I love the quality of the food. The speedy delivery.. the order online option.. everything. Today, while placing my order, a coworker talked about how you advertise speedy delivery, but always come up short. Me, never experiencing such misfortune.. said, \"My delivery has never taken more than 15 minutes.. you must be on crack\". I ordered, and then started my stopwatch 1 minute after clicking the final order button. (I ordered a tuna sandwich with avocado) I was so confident too, because last time, my sandwich came in just over 10 minutes!! So I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited.. Ashamed. I hyped you up sooooo much! 29 minutes and 26 seconds later, your dude shows up!!! That is waaayyy too long. I could have walked across the street to JJ's, ordered, payed, returned and taken a 15 minute nap. I am a busy man JJ's.. A busy, hungry man. Here's the icing on the cake (or lack there of).. you chumps forgot the avocado!!! That was 75 cents! Gone! I am so mad at you. I feel like I just walked in on my wife getting freaky with Dwight Howard. Not cool-"}
{"text":"A little pricey for a sandwich shop, but I love the drive in and the bread. Staff are always friendly and it's my go to place to  a \"healthier\" alternative to fast food... especially on a hot day."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for my sandwich.  Called the store and the worker was polite, but there's no excuse for taking 45 minutes to deliver a sandwich.  If you're running that far behind on orders, hire more people."}
{"text":"Went to the Summerlin store service was great! It was my first time going! The sandwich was made before I could finish my sentence! Reason being on my Italian sub 8\"! Had one row of salami paper THIN cut of meat, lettuce and tomatoes for $8.54 combo the best thing was the chips! Disappointed for sure don't know what all the hype is about!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan. The first time I ate here about 2.5 years ago, I was extremely sick afterwards. So much so that I thought I had food poisoning. I recently tried it again last week and again my experience was an epic fail. I ordered the veggie sub with the avocado. .where tf was it? Not only that, for a veggie it only had lettuce and tomato. .no onions, no peppers.. nada. And it tasted disgusting.  I called to complain and to get my money back. I spoke with one fella who completely blubbered on the phone and finally he passed it to his manager. She kept offering a gift card or store credit, now idk about you.. but if you did not like the food, why would you want more of it? I sure as hell didn't. Then she said something about not being able to give a credit on my card because the close the drawers at 3 pm when the shift finishes. She said I could come in and get cash refund. So on my dinner break at work I took my butt up there. A different gal argued with me about the stupid gift card or credit, until finally Gabriel came to my rescue. He recalled what the manager earlier advised and asked, she didn't call you? She got it back on your card! That frustrated me bc of course I didn't receive a call, I wouldn't have wasted my time. Then he said since you're here I'll make you a sandwich. It was better than the original, but the lettuce and sprouts taste like they'd been sitting in dish water, the avocado isn't real slices it's a crappy spread. Moral of the story. .. just go to Subway! You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Not too many sandwich (i.e. any) sandwich places offer Gluten free options, but their unwich option is awesome!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday and had great service. Sandwich was great. Service was fast. But today I came here again and when I got to my car I noticed that there was no cheese in my sandwich so I went inside and asked for a couple piece to put on it. Max, a short Hispanic male worker, was at the register and started asking me for my order details then my ticket number. He started pushing buttons on the register for about four minutes, making a few pieces of cheese a huge deal. When another customer came in he told me to step aside and he will have to keep looking for my ticket so he can charge me for the cheese. I told him to just charge me then. He was very rude with every word that came out of his mouth. There were several other employees there that told him to just hit the cheese button at which point he snapped at them and said, \"don't argue with me!\"  I couldn't believe the disrespect, to me the customer and to his coworkers. This guy has no business being in customer service. He should be moved to the back to wash dishes if he can't handle being polite. After he snapped at the coworker, another one put two pieces of cheese in a sleeve and gave it to me. She said she was just going to pay for it.    I gave I've star for this restaurant based on Max. If he gets removed from here then I will review my rating."}
{"text":"This is the quintessential fast food restaurant.  Fast, efficient, clean, and appealing.  Their sandwiches are quite different from for example Subway's.  Their prices I think are higher.  I always have their \"Unwich\" which is their protein-style sandwich without a bun."}
{"text":"I typically love my JJ experience. My go to are the 12 & 15! I came to this location tonight for a bite and the customer service is horrible! From the cashier to the manager to the way food was prepared...tonight's visit was the worst by far. People need to at least seem to be happy to be at work and when dealing with the public don't be a jerk, we are paying your paycheck!  Won't return to this location!"}
{"text":"I like JJs because it's fast and affordable. I called in My order and by the time I walked there it was finished. Today I had the #12 which is one of my favorite sandwiches, I think primarily because it has turkey and avocado! Get extra veggies, peppers and it's a delight. I would recommend it to anyone. Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"Do you want a sub freaky fast? Freaking right? DO NOT go to this location. I have always loved jimmy johns until I started ordering from this one. The customer service is terrible! The amount of times they have screwed up orders is obnoxious and utterly frustrating. They do not refund you if they mess up your order, they just force you to wait until they deliver another one. Very frustrating for people who only have a 30 minute lunch break!   I would give 0/5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Had a sandwich delivered.  Tipped the driver with cash.  The driver then ADDED TIP to the receipt so I was charged an additional $3 for a sandwich.  This is called committing wire fraud.  When I called to report this, the assistant manager was helpful but didn't understand the major breach his employee has made and wasn't sure if he'd be fired.  Regardless, I have deleted my account and will NEVER order food from this restaurant again.  I would warn you all to follow suit."}
{"text":"I stopped in here exactly once and it's the last time. I do not understand why Jimmy John's only offers provolone cheese. I do not like provolone cheese that much. So lame... get some swiss up in here already!   The employees seemed to completely hate their jobs. Like being at that place was sucking the life out of them. This is a trend I've noticed at the other Jimmy John's I've been to (and only because my boyfriend is paying).  The portion of roast beef I got had a weird green iridescence on it. I know it's supposedly \"normal\" for deli meats, but I think it's disgusting. What was even worse were the gelatinous sections in the meat. Not fat, but a clear jelly-like substance, which was next to some incredibly tough and chewy parts of meat that I had to spit out. Totally disgusting. Was it even real beef? Never again, Jersey Mike's has a far superior product.   Another thing to note, I live less than two miles away from this location yet it's too far for their delivery service. I joke with my boyfriend that you have to be somewhere in the Costco parking lot area to take advantage of their delivery."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. Spent $24 on three regular size turkey subs with bacon (extra $1.50 each sandwich for the bacon). No drinks or anything, just the subs! They might be longer than a 6\" elsewhere, but they are practically half the width! I really couldn't taste any turkey (not much on there), just bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo. The restaurant was clean enough, but smelled bad. Not sure why... Won't be back, sorry!"}
{"text":"Food decent nothing special. Make sure you tell them what you want on it they will not ask. Now the employees. Rudest I've encountered in some time. First time here. I order at register guy walks away didn't come back. They assume we know the process. Then I get my bone dry sandwich. I ask for a napkin. Rude lady hands me one but wouldn't even look up when she gave it to me. Like I was supposed to know where everything is. I won't be back. Jersey Mike's is right next door should have went there in the first place."}
{"text":"I come here for the quick and fast service. I always order the same two items, and within a few minutes, my order is ready. The employees are friendly, and they always greet me with a hi when I walk in. The location is very convenient for me which is why I come here as often as I do."}
{"text":"First off let me say that I LOVE JJ's, that's why it's terrible that I would have to give this location a 2 star. There's nothing wrong with the sandwiches, they're pretty much on par with all of the other locations. My problem is with the staff and atmosphere. Every time I have been in to this location the music is BLARING. It's hard enough with the open ceilings, the sound effects of a busy kitchen, customer chatter, the last thing needed is a pre-recorded concert at max volume. Not only is the music high but often times inappropriate for a business environment. Not that I wouldn't listen to such music, it's just that I don't think the 7 yr old in front of me should have to listen to explicit content while waiting for food. This isn't the only thing that's wrong with this location. The attitudes of the staff sometimes make it seem like they're doing you a favor for being there. Even the manager seems to think it's a joke. Immature employees throwing food around like a fish toss makes you kinda wonder if your food has hit the ground at one time. There's a lot more, and honestly i'm not sure why I go back, when it comes to JJ's this location is trash. Maybe I'll have better luck with the local Firehouse subs when it opens up. Lame sauce."}
{"text":"Freaky fast like promised. First time eating at Jimmy John's- no lie. I was not really interested in another Subway type place. The sandwich was pretty yummy and I didn't take an hour to decide. I arrived right before the lunch rush so I felt lucky because people just came crawling out of no where to line up for Jimmy Johns. They also had like 6 delivery bike riders. Sounds like they are ready to feed an Army. Ok I tried it. Yum. I'll be back, but next time less mayo!"}
{"text":"I am only giving one star because my beach club sandwich was good. I was the only one in the store, ordered my sandwich from a very nice girl then the young guy who made my sandwich had such a ' I don't give a shit' attitude. I believe his name was Troy, forgot my sprouts. I asked for them and a napkin , he appeared annoyed, no apology.  He pointed at the napkins behind the counter ( which were right next to him) two times for me to get. He was too lazy to take off his gloves while making a sandwich. As I sat and ate, I listened to their chat about movies and such, the two guys - Sam( the manager) and Jared. When I complained about the customer service after, the manager Sam gave me major attitude, made me feel like I had no right and was stupid and smirked and rolled his eyes at me. I left, called to speak to Sam the manager, who informed me he did not have a district or regional manager for the store, said he could not give me his manager's information and hung up while I was still talking. Worst customer service ever, and this Manager Sam is an asshole who thinks he is irreplaceable."}
{"text":"I'm a loyal customer!  I love that I can order an unwich and have it delivered in less then 15 minute!  The employees have always been very friendly and proof that I'm there to much, they know me when I call!  LOL"}
{"text":"My daughter and I came here earlier today. This was our first time and she got a number #1 and I got a #12. She said her sandwich was really good and mine was also. The bread was very soft. Service was very fast and friendly. We will definitely come back again soon."}
{"text":"I would like to thank my addiction to comic books for another addiction.. Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches.. but as the ad states clearly, they're not really Gourmet sandwiches, they're damn tasty sandwiches.. and let's leave it at that.   I needed my comic book fix on a Wednesday afternoon and well, I found a shop about two stores down from this location. After getting my weekly issues, I was allured by the sign saying that the smells were free and sure enough, those smells were something i would pay for if I had to.   The sandwich prices were really cheap. Who needs some silly Subway when you have a place like this? Workers were pretty helpful and I'm glad I didn't have to deal with a Sandwich artist, as true art is very subjective on being enjoyed by all.   My first sandwich here was a Turkey Tom. Maybe I was just trying to cleanse my system from all the drinking with some healthy protein, but this sucker was delicious. While some may not like sprouts, I think they're the forgotten green. Be them a micro one.    Their Vito was also really good. Them Italian subs, now that there is a spicy genoa salami sandwich with capicola and provolone and hot peppers!   Their house brand chips were also pretty damn tasty considering I'm not much of a chipper lover. I think I'm hooked after this first taste to sandwiches here. A shame since I'm a state away."}
{"text":"So good that I ate here for lunch AND Dinner! I'm not sure if you've ever had the same thing from the same place twice in one day, but perhaps when you do, you'll realize that it was a really good sandwich.   Besides, think of the savings you get when you reuse the same soda cup you bought the first time you went in. Be warned though, you may get a bit of a dirty look from the owner for doing so.. Even if you've just plopped down money for two meals from the same place..   We were hitting the road back to Los Angeles and since we sandwiched a game of Mini golf between lunch and when we were going to be on the open road, we figured we would take a sandwich for the five hour drive back and when you're looking for good sandwiches, you look to Jimmy John's.   Even though you think Hawt Dawwwwwgs or deep dish pizzas when you think of Chicago, they should also have another popular item added to their list of great foods to come out of there.. Jimmy John's.   Really fresh sandwiches that have a good portion of meat and some great combination. Service is great and the food is really really affordable. Subway may make the claim of $5 subs, but you really come through in the pinch and produce some amazing sandwiches. Not to mention all your signs in the place are witty as all hell.   Though, come on, owner dude. Why the scoffed look when I was refilling my soda? I just dropped a good $30 on your place for both lunch and dinner, within an hour and a half. You can't spare the soda syrup for a long drive back?  Think of it this way, instead of me sitting outside eating my LUNCH sandwich, I went to play indoor mini-golf in the building next to yours before coming back and buying road Dinner."}
{"text":"This is a great Jimmy Johns, as far as the chain goes.  Before you can get the order out, and get your drink your sandwich is ready...  Dressed to go, and you are sent out the door with a polite, friendly smile!  This location doesn't have a drive through, but the bathrooms are clean and the prices are a bit cheaper than my local Jimmy Johns in NC.  I got a combo with extra meat for under $8."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are delicious!   There is no doubt about it.  If you have ever had a Blimpies Sandwich, it tastes most like that.  These sandwiches will put Subways Sandwiches to utter shame.    The bread is fresh, the meat is good quality.  The place is clean, and the service is quick.    Now having given all that praise I will explain why the paltry three star   rating.  This place isn't for the budget conscious.  They nickel and dime their patrons shamelessly!  The sandwiches start around four dollars and end around nine bucks.  These are not foot longs or stuffed with meats either.  Each sandwich is the same size.    They charge .25 cents for a simple cup of iced water, and the combos are not reasonably priced either.  Cheese is an additional charge.  There are no specials of the day, no frequent buyer benefits.  No discounts of any type...  Not even a cup of tap water is free.           They joke about how cheap they are with a neon sign that reads \"free smells,\" or something to that effect.  Based on the complete absence of customer incentives, I am guessing this chain does not value their customers.  This amuses me, because I can recall many businesses that once displayed similar attitudes towards their patrons.  Most of them are no longer around."}
{"text":"Underrated. Jimmy John's is a winner. I've had two subs here - the Vito (Italian sub topped with genoa salami, provolone, capicola, onion, lettuce, tomato & Italian vinaigrette) and the Totally Tuna. Both sandwiches feature above-average toppings including vegetables that smell and taste fresh, not like the typical bagged produce flavor that defines places like Subway.  The bread is noteworthy - it's hard and crusty on the outside but with a nice soft crumb inside. It's similar to the bread used at Jersey Mike's, only without the corn meal dusting.  Best of all, a filling 8\" sub (yes, I just typed those words) is only $4.75.  Good lunch option when you want something basic and cheap."}
{"text":"I love this Jimmy John's. I order delivery from here at least 4-5 times per week. They have never made a mistake on any of my orders and their delivery time is amazingly fast... It's almost scary how fast it is sometimes. I wonder if they have perfected time travel and are holding out on the rest of the world, because it took only six minutes from the time I submitted my order to the time the delivery guy was knocking at my door."}
{"text":"Can I start this review with a little emoesque touch.... I am sad... To say the least. I hear from every direction that jimmy johns is #1, the best, the winner, the best looking, best smelling, moi guapo, the sexiest sandwich this side of the Rio grand and for that I say to you all, I am glad that none of you happened to be my wing man in my younger days. This place was T-T-T-Terrible. Pulling up to this joint I was curious if the recommendations would pay off and at first glance I thought yes it would. I mean pulling up to place that has a bright neon sign that clearly says Free Smells seems comical and like they had something up their sleeves. Open the door and POW you are hit with the smell of Pickles and floor cleaner but I can look past that so I take a quick look at the menu and decide to grab a gargantuan, the wife figured you can go wrong with a BLT and the kids would kick down a turkey and cheese.   I know that the order sounds pretty ordinary and seems pretty easy to achieve greatness, unfortunately that was not the case. After waiting in the cramped quarters for our sandwiches we sat down to see what the jimmy johns hype is all about and that first bite was like the moment your parents popped your favorite balloon and all the air shot out of it and you felt completely let down. Okay so that might be a little much and if it felt like that then you may want to be checked for daddy issues but I assure you it was not good.   I was hungry so I dealt with my sandwich but my wife asked me to try her BLT and see if I thought the bacon was no good or something and even though I thought for a second that she was over reacting and in my mind I mumbled, \" come on Hun, bacon is bacon\" as I took a bite I began to scream in my mind, \" What the hell is that, it is definitely not bacon\". so first thing was first she stripped the bacon out of her sandwich and decided to pull a piece of turkey out of the kids sandwich and transform her BLT to a turkey sandwich in hopes for a better experience but the issue was that the turkey sandwich had only one slice of meat and we couldn't just give the kids a bread sandwich now could we.   I don't want to turn this into a 100% rant but unfortunately to all of you Jimmy Johns Lovers that I know, please warn me before we hand out next time.... I'll grab Subway. I'm sorry was that a low blow, Well sometimes the truth is like a kick in the metaphorical nutts."}
{"text":"First consequence of the higher minimum wage law? Cookies now 2 bucks. Yeah, thank you. I didn't need the cookie anyway.  $7 for a loaded sandwich is pushing it a bit for what it is.   Guess my frugal nature means bag lunches from home more often."}
{"text":"JJs has the best bread of any chain sub sandwich joint anywhere around.  Thank you, Jimmy, for having a Customer Appreciation Day.  Did I know you'd be packed? Yup. Did I know the line to order would be long? Yup. For $1, how can anyone complain?  I arrived at 2:30. The line was moving in both directions. I was getting closer to the cash register while the end of the line was getting longer and longer. It took about 25 minutes for me to place my order. Not bad!  Kudos to your in-store management team for having your entire team fully prepared for armageddon. All necessary supplies were stocked. Fresh bread was on racks everywhere. But, most amazingly, the team of sandwich pros was as calm as could be. They were just moving seamlessly from order to order. It took about 5 minutes from the time my order was entered until it was ready. Honestly not much longer than most times during a lunch rush.  The place was clean. In the prep area. In the seating area. In the restroom! How? I have no idea. But, wow!  I had a #3 (tuna) with the works. I never understand why you \"scoop the bread\" on 1-6 but not on the others. The bread is part of your signature. Don't waste it. Anyway, I know to ask for it to not be scooped. I did ask. It wasn't scooped. Not bad considering by this time (3 o'clock) your people had to be numb and likely had made many hundreds of subs by then.  So, all around: I routinely have consistent experiences in JJs all over the Valley but, all things considered for the day today, A+ outstanding job.   Oh, and to the blonde-haired woman (roughly 40-something) with a huge wedding band: not cool that you kept sneaking back into line at the head of the line telling people the BS that you'd been \"standing in the 'other' line.\" Karma can be cruel. You may have gotten a dozen sandwiches since you'd told people you'd been waiting since 1:45, but I hope all those calories go right to your problem areas. Honey. No one else jumped the line (at least not while I was there.) Good job on the part of the cashier who clearly recognized you for not calling you out and choosing to just shrug it off instead. I guess $1 subs mean that much to you.  And to your entire staff: seriously, congrats! Job well done. I was amazed at how many people were ungrateful and how many people in the short time I was there, tried to cheat the system (in addition to the line jumper I just mentioned.) Sad."}
{"text":"I have to give it to the state of AZ.  They have a lot of Midwest type establishments because of all the transplants.  That is fine by me.  Jimmy Johns started in Illinois, and now they are all over the dang place.  Anyways......I decided to come to this Jimmy Johns for lunch today.  I went with the JJ Gargantuan (no mayo) and a chocolate chip cookie.  Total was right around $10.00 and I was out the door.  Here is how everything was...........  JJ Gargantuan-  This beast was heavy!  The sandwich has a mix of genoa salami, ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey and provolone cheese.  It is topped with the usual sub toppings like lettuce, onions, tomatoes and oil and vinegar.  They stuff all of this between a French type loaf of bread. It was very sturdy, yet pliable when you bit in.  Its a perfect style loaf to support all these toppings!   It's only about 8 inches long (that's what she said!), but its so stuffed to the gills, it's almost hard to eat.  You either have to unhinge your jaw, or have to kind of take a bite from the top, then the bottom and make your way along like that.  Great mix of flavors though!  Not sure if you could get a better sandwich from here.  I've only been  to Jimmy John's a few times, but every single time, I have gotten this particular sandwich and will continue to do so.  Don't stray from a winner, right?  Chocolate Chip Cookie-  Not sure if I was just craving something sweet, or what, but this was one of the best damn chocolate chip cookies I have had in awhile!  They are $1.50 each, but they are huge and worth every penny.  They were soft enough to enjoy, but not mushy.  They also weren't really \"crisp\" per say, kind of a middle ground of texture.  You could tell that these things were loaded with butter (the secret to great cookies!) and every bite was sensational.  I could seriously see myself coming here and buying a couple of cookies on their own.  By far the best cookie I have had from a sandwich shop...and its not even close!  These were great!  Jimmy John's is just a tad more pricey than other \"fast food\" sandwich places, but the quality and sheer amount of ingredients they pile on their sandwiches make it worth paying the extra couple of bucks. This place is right up the street from work and I'm sure I will be back often whenever a sandwich craving hits."}
{"text":"This is a great Jimmy John's! The service is always fast for me and the don't mind weird requests. Manager was very nice and helped with our questions."}
{"text":"I am adding a new review. Still sometimes slow, but getting faster! Super fast in store.   Also company contacted me to apologize and work on improving their service.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"I have never ate in the restaurant. However I use the app for delivery a few times a month. App is super easy to use, food is always fast and fresh. Being I always get delivery, I can't comment on the store, but can tell you all of the delivery drivers I have interacted with are always friendly for the most part. The salt and vinegar chips and the lemonade are to die for."}
{"text":"Dont eat @ this Jimmy Johns! Just save yourself. In the last 4 month's I've gotten sick from their sandwich's EVERY SINGLE TIME! I keep thinking it's something else and giving them the benefit of the doubt, but no.. every single time (I've grabbed a sandwich maybe once a month because it's conveniently close), about an hr after, BOOM - running to the toilet. TMI? Yeah, well don't go there or else you'll be sitting on the toilet wishing you would have listened.  I always buy the number 12, unwich (if that helps?), however my boss bought a number 9 and got sick from it recently as well. Also, I don't typically get sick from fast food places, even Taco Bell sits well with me so I have no clue what JJ's is doing.  Basically save yourself. I'm so over Jimmy John's and their obviously spoiled food."}
{"text":"Not sure how long this location has been open. It was pretty good. I gave it three stars because they got my son's sandwich wrong. Twice. And they didn't apologize. Didn't offer to take it off the bill or offer him a comp cookie or chips. Not cool.   My sandwich was good- I got the JJBLT but added sprouts and cucumber and made it an \"unwich\" which is no bread. It is wrapped in lettuce. I enjoyed it. My husband enjoyed his sandwich too. He got a #9 with hot peppers.   We liked the music in the store. They were using Pandora.  It was a little loud. We also liked the signs on the wall.  We would try it again."}
{"text":"Freaky slow! In fact, it took exactly 1hr 10min for a half mile delivery. Your best bet with this particular store is to just drive in and pick up. Don't bother with delivery if you're hungry."}
{"text":"The food is always good but I ordered a California sub & it was missing half of the ingredients. I pretty much ended up with a Turkey Tom with some avocado in it. No tomatoes, cucumbers and sprouts. Of course I didn't realize until I got back to my office & opened my sub to eat. :("}
{"text":"I like Jimmy John's.  They are close to my work, and I often use the online ordering feature from their website.  I can go pick up my sub on my lunch, and they always have it ready and correct.   I usually get the turkey, and it's fresh. I also like that they use Hellman's mayo.  I'm pleased with Jimmy John's overall!"}
{"text":"You know what you are going to get and thats why I stop at JJ's . However, the service at this location in the evening sucks. Sulky , ill mannered employee . Maybe its because he was only one working . Perhaps owner of this location should play undercover boss. Dont think that hed be pleased"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Walked in expecting my usual experience and was surprised  by how awesome the staff is here! I've attached pictures to show how clean and nice they had the restaurant. We ordered the #1 and the #12. I took my sandwich back up to the counter to ask if they could cut it in half for me and the employee told me that she'd help me as soon as she finished the sandwich she was preparing. Instantly another employee approached and if I had been helped. I replied yes, that I was just waiting for my sandwich to be cut and she said \"oh I can help with that!\" Usually people hear \"yes, I've been helped\" and  the walk away. Truly appreciated the kindness and good job the staff are doing here and I let them know that in person!"}
{"text":"I work downtown and have limited time for lunch, so Jimmy John's is always the best option when you want/need FAST food!   I have always had a good experience ordering from this location and on average, my food is delivered in 15 minutes or less.   I continue to order here regularly."}
{"text":"\"Deliver so fast you'll freak!\" I totally freaked out! I was on my 30min lunch yesterday, and wanted Panda Express. Went to Panda didnt realize I was too early. 9:30a.m I shall say. Yes, Early lunch since I start work at 4am..Panda was still close, then I decided to try the sub from Jimmy Johns. Damn was I impressed with their service! While the cashier was ringing up my order, the Sandwich maker was preparing my sandwich! and best of all, I was given my changes along with my order! and the best part! The Roast Beef sub was delicious!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!  Jimmy John's has some great sandwiches.  Good price for a quality sandwich."}
{"text":"We basically go here because of the Unwich. I can't eat bread but hubby does so I appreciate they offer something for everyone in our family. Sandwiches themselves are OK. I'm never blown away but like them enough. Super fast which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a snack today while running errands. Ordered a sandwich and asked if they could please cut it in half so my wife and I could share. After I payed for the food I asked if they could not put onions on half of the sandwich. The kid at the register smirked and went over to the other boy working and they whispered something and smiled. The register kid came back over and sarcastically said \"Normally we don't take items off only half our sandwiches, this isn't Subway.\"   I was THE ONLY CUSTOMER IN THE RESTAURANT besides a woman working on papers in the corner. I thought it wouldn't be a problem since they weren't busy and stated they didn't have to if it was that big of an inconvenience.   Congratulations on losing customers. We will not be returning. 12/23/17 - 3:35pm  Merry Christmas from Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"Since we just moved here from South Carolina where the service was friendly, \"Freaky Fast\", and you're greeted with enthusiasm when you walk in the door.. We are incredibly disappointed with the service at this location. We placed an order online, to save time etc., and when we went to pick up the order, we were greeted with  attitude and frankly very slow service (which seemed almost on purpose) for such a normally great place. We won't be visiting this location again and I'd suggest that the fella working this evening find a better calling, besides sandwiches."}
{"text":"Driest sandwich I've ever had. No cheese? Won't return. This place makes a very boring sub"}
{"text":"So I'm the most picky eater and Jimmy Johns caters directly too me!!! I really hate lettuce and most other vegetables. Jimmy Johns lets me order my sandwich \"slim\" which means no veggies or sauce (they will give you mayo/mustard packets) and actually charge less!!! So, I don't have to worry about asking for my sandwich without_____(fill in veggie here) and having to pick it off! GENIUS!!! I don't live in their delivery area but if I did I would also be stocked because they deliver with a 1 sandwich minimum!  I hope they build more locations around town!"}
{"text":"One star for thier butthole..... Theyve been delivering food within thier 2 mile radius... I call to get a delivery and they tell me only half a mile radius.... I go down to pick up my order and ask questions amd the manager Ryan was a total dick. Rude and outright useless...eff this place. Never going back there again... Back to port a subs..."}
{"text":"Delicious food for a cheap price and the crew at the location is fast! No one there when I went but by the time I paid my sub was ready to go! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"I work for a dealership and many of my employees order from your company daily. This also means I understand the importance of humility, customer service, and common courtesy. Apparently the  manager of store # 1502 \"Kevin\" does not. After placing a delivery order totaling $11.50 it arrived and I handed the driver a $20. He asked \"Do you want change\" Of course! A $9 tip?! The worst part is when I said yes he asked \"how much?\" I find this extremely rude and when I called the store Kevin told me \"I used to be a driver, you just don't understand\" Is this how you run a business? I was so offended!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are good. Quick and sleazy. The ingredients are fresh and the sandwiches are pretty cheap. The service is so quick. Once, I ordered and before I even paid, the sandwich was made! :D  I actually like this place better than Subway because I feel the ingredients are fresher. Subway is way overprocessed. I had a friend work at Subway and he told me that the bread is delivered to the restaurants as dehydrated sticks. They put them in a rehydrator and that's the bread you get. yech! :P The one thing is that the sandwiches are quite plain. Not a whole lot of flavor out of lettuce, meat, tomatoes, and bread but at least you know everything that is in it.   If you're looking for something quick, easy, and fairly healthy I'd go for Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone else says the service is bad? These employees are always professional and nice! Super fast service which  always keeps me going back!"}
{"text":"Delivery was fast.  The unwich had some opportunity.  Was difficult to eat.  See picture."}
{"text":"The food is ok. Bread is a little hard but my biggest problem is their lack of attention. They mislabeled our two sandwiches so that when my dad dropped my son and I off and we finished carrying in our luggage and he took off with the one labeled as #7 it was the wrong one. So now he's 30 minutes away and neither of us have the food we ordered. They also didn't cut my pickle like they offered :(. Little things maybe but we were the only customers. Just pay attention to what you're doing. Being fast is useless if you can't be correct."}
{"text":"Incredibly fast delivery! Don't be too surprised if you receive your food in less than 10 minutes from ordering!!  Their delivery service consists of numerous bicycle riders who work very hard to maintain consistent and incredible service, delivering until 3am & 4am on weekends! These guys are worth it.  And hey, the food is pretty darn good & cheap too. Jimmy John's is the perfect solution to your munchies (or drunchies) on those occasions when you'd really rather now move from the couch, or take a chance driving... Call in or order online!"}
{"text":"I had a great relaxing time here, food was good, not great. Music live band was enjoying to listen to. Very clean table, seats, floor and dinning wares. Only thing is way to dark, drinks weak."}
{"text":"Great subs great service clean restaurant what more can you ask for. I love this place people are very friendly great great subs."}
{"text":"Such a better option then Subway across the street.  The staff is extremely friendly and quick!  My food is ready to go within a minute after placing the order.  I tend to come in late (10-15 minutes before closing) because of my night classes, I'm still always greeted by super courteous employees. AJ is awesome!! Quality control, I never have to be afraid about an \"off night\" or bad order!  No matter what I order I can come to expect a fresh sandwich and a super affordable price.  Solid location with friendly service and constant quality has me coming back multiple times a week."}
{"text":"Short version? It sucked. But WHY did it suck? Ok, let's start from the beginning. I called around 8pm to place my order. I ordered DD's simple sandwich first, then went on to mine, which is always complicated. I requested the Veggie with no cheese, no mayo, no tomatoes, and no cucumbers. Then I stated that in place of the things I was omitting, I'd like extra avocado spread. He said, \"ok.\" Then I proceeded to add my freebies like sprouts, oil & vinegar, peppers, etc. It had been a while since I'd ordered JJ's for myself, so I couldn't recall if they gave you a pickle spear with your sandwich (I'm 80% certain the JJ's back home did), so I asked. He said, \"Yeah, you can get them on the side.\" Ok, sweet.   @ 8:55pm. JJ's arrives. I look at the receipt and I was charged for the extra avocado spread and for 2 orders of pickles. Why did he not tell me that he was charging me for these things? Granted, this is only a couple of bucks, but it's the principle. I called and spoke with the manager, Nick. I inquired why, if I omitted cheese (which costs $0.75 to add), would I be charged $0.75 for the extra avocado spread? It clearly evens itself out. He basically said that his POS (the cash register) wasn't sophisticated enough to handle the swap. Really? THAT's your excuse?! I asked for the GM, whom Nick stated had just quit last week, so.... At this point, I'm just done. I didn't even get to the darn pickles. In that moment I decided that I simply won't patronize this JJ's again. (Did I mention that the sandwiches were freezing cold when they arrived? Any other JJ's always toasts my bread.)  There is a JJ's down the street, by the Quarter; I'll give them my business instead."}
{"text":"After working all day at a convention downtown, I was starving and in dire need of nourishment.  It was after 9pm on a Sunday evening, and this was about the only place (that I know of) open in the area where I could get something veggie.  I love that this location has a drive-thru.  The girl taking my order needed a lesson in manners, but when I got to the window, I had someone nicer assisting me.  I got my sandwich and it was NOT what I had ordered. It was instead, a bland and dry imitation of what I wanted. *hard sigh*  I don't like wasting money but I was super hungry so I scarfed it down.  I won't go so far as to say I'd never return. However, if I ever find myself needing to revisit, I'll definitely double-check my order prior to leaving.  Also, that drive-thru is very narrow, especially when pulling away from the window. So watch out for the curbs on each side of your rims."}
{"text":"8 employees, 2 sandwiches. No one else in line. And they still messed up the order. If it wasnt for the hard bread the sandwich would have been decent. I dont know if ill go back again."}
{"text":"Newest sub shop in Avon and really enjoy their subs.   Since it is a new shop the place is really clean and the staff is very friendly.  Only suggestion I have is \"turn down the music\" so you can actually have a conversation in the place.  Have been here 3 or 4 times now and every time the music is way to loud.  Not sure why but turn down the music!"}
{"text":"I give this place a 5 star because my Order was made perfect. The guy at the register was friendly and they also give military discount!  I like giving a business my business if they honor military.  I also came in at 2, zero wait, not busy.   My order was fresh, bread was good and didn't lack inside goodies.  Jimmy johns hot peppers are delish!! Something I miss coming from the sandwich capital of the world. (PA)   I will come back because I didn't have a bad experience. Thank u staff!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I got the Italian with hot peppers and it is delish! I couldn't leave the office today so they delivered it right to me so quickly and the driver was very friendly. What a great experience. WIll definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"It's a nice new store right next to my sons condo in south pointe I went in for lunch and had the tuna sub it was really good. I think the prices are a little less than subway and the staff was really polite and fast. They also deliver which is nice but if you eat in they have plenty of seating and it's really clean. I think there commercials are really funny."}
{"text":"Great staff! Great food! Always super helpful and friendly. We love this Jimmy Johns location! I know they try to remain freaky fast on deliveries and when you're inside picking up a sammie. We've done last minute catering orders without any issue. Super clean too! Like CRAZY clean. Keep up the good work :)"}
{"text":"I had a late night craving for a fresh sandwich and decided to stop by this Jimmy John's location. It always looks dead so I had very fast service as expected! The prices are reasonable and the food is definitely better quality than Subway. I highly recommend the J.J. Gargantuan. It's pretty big but not as big as it looks in pictures. Ask for cucumbers. It's free!"}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars, I would. My boss ordered lunch today at 12:23 as an online delivery.  It FINALLY arrived at 12:55.  What a crock of shit.  What happened to Freaky Fast? This was Freakishly unacceptable. I called the restaurant for him to find out what was up.  The guy who answered the phone said \"Uh, that driver left at 12:27. Hmmm. The \"General Manager\", term used VERY, VERY LOOSELY, Taylor was awful.  She had no idea what was wrong with that. She said it was \"lunch rush\". I don't give a rat's ass what kind of rush it is.  Then you should let your customer know ahead of time. In the mean time, I asked her to comp his lunch which was a whopping $7.73 due to the fact that it was extremely late and had been sitting in the driver's hot car for 1/2 an hour.  Keep in mind, our office is 1 block away from this restaurant. Her response was no, no, no to everything. I asked if a new, fresh lunch could be made, and right at that exact time guess who shows up.  Yep, the clueless driver who did not apologize.  The \"GM\" was useless. I tell you what, it would've been smarter for her to graciously comp the low dollar lunch. Now, I have told the whole office about the ordeal and NONE OF US will be ordering from here again.  What shitty customer service. For all of you contemplating a sub sandwich, try Jersey Mike's across the street.  They don't deliver, but the food is far superior as well as the customer service."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's and I used to go to this one all the time since it's close to my house, but NEVER again. My boyfriend and I both got beach clubs through the drive thru and when we got home it was just a dry sandwich with only turkey, lettuce, and cheese. There was no avocado, no cucumber, no tomato, and no mayo. I would understand if they were busy and may have gotten our order mixed up, but we were literally the only customers there. Against my better judgement I decided to try them once more a few days ago. Once again I got home and my beach club had no cucumbers and no avocado. Again I was the only customer there so I don't understand what goes wrong. Jimmy John's used to be my go to sandwich place, but like I said, NEVER again."}
{"text":"I ordered online and realized i put pick up instead of delivery. So i called to notify them that I would like delivery instead. When the guy answered he said \"ugh now i have to void it\" like i was troubling him. He asked for my addressed in a very rude way  the whole feel of the conversation went that way . When he still sounded angry i simply said \"this can not be the first time this happened\" where he rudely answered, \"for me yes\" it was just so unpleasant."}
{"text":"Food is great, place is a little small but does the job well. Only thing I can say bad is the blonde girl at the register needs a personality, and we can all do without her sarcasm"}
{"text":"Great fast service as always, the only draw back I noticed was one of the employees using regular winded to clean the dining room tables. I'm no scientist, but I believe windex doesn't do as good of a job disinfecting things as things that are designated disinfectants. I'd like to eat off a clean table not one cleaned with window cleaner!"}
{"text":"Bomb like a puppy and a kitten sharing a holiday meal together!"}
{"text":"The subs were only Ok, nothing special. I ordered 3 subs to go and they refused to place them in a bag. The girl told me they couldn't put the food in a bag because they have gloves on??? Aren't the gloves disposable??? The customer service is HORRIBLE... Never going back.  If you notice any good reviews are about getting food fast, NOT quality or taste."}
{"text":"There was a HUGE menu refresh a couple of weeks ago, so I thought I'd stop by to check it out..  There's about twice as many sandwiches now, with the new selections 'promising to be thicker fillings' costing just about $1.00 more than the old selections. Most are just mashups of their old selection.. ie: Bacon and ham, double roast beef, etc etc. I ordered my ham/bacon with onions and the NEW optional in-house made spicy ranch dressing/sauce.   Jimmy John's main draw is their afreaky fast subs and their fresh bread... As usual, my sandwich was made in about 1.5 minutes and the sandwich tasted awesome and fresh like usual. There was enough extra meat to warrant the extra buck in my opinion.   I've never really had a bad experience at a Jimmy John's. Including the Midwest and Seattle where I'm from, I've been to about 20 locations. They're always clean, and friendly(even if they're fake, I don't care).   I recommend this place over Subway, Jersey Mike's, and Quiznos.   Subway: Cheapest, most sub for your dollar  Jersey Mike's: Best/freshest/most meat  Quiznos: Best warm/baked sub  Jimmy John's: best overall tasting/bargain"}
{"text":"Never been this horrified to go back to any Jimmy Johns after my experience with this location. I work near this one so I always order sandwiches from them. At first,it was little things like screwing up the order or not bringing something,then it was the waiting for an hour and a half a couple times,then finally to my last and final time ordering from them. My friend and I ordered two sandwiches,opened them and she realized there was a small pubic looking hair on her sandwich. We were grossed out,laughed about it;she cut the sandwich where she found the hair and proceeded to eat the other half. She looked down and found yet ANOTHER hair,the same as the last one. She is eight months pregnant and couldn't eat for the rest of the day. Would anyone want to eat after that? We called and complained,the guy was extremely rude and didn't even apologize,just said \"what sandwich was it on?\" He told her to bring the physical sandwich with the hairs on it to the restaurant to get a refund. She went after work to do it,and when she walked in and told them why she was there,they told her to throw the sandwich out as she handed it to them. Totally rude,no personal skills and definitely no communication skills. Never again."}
{"text":"You'll always get a solid sandwich at jimmy johns. The low rating is for the staff because when we walked in they were blasting their music and could hardly hear what we were ordering. I get that there were no customers at the time, but turn down the music and stop talking to your friends hanging out in the store for a second to get a customer's order correct. While they were friendly, they didn't get my order completely correct. Also do I have to ask for my sandwich cut in half? I definitely recommend the jimmys mustard though."}
{"text":"Jimmy john's is awful.  If the only thing you can hang your hat on is that you're quick w your subs ... count me out.... Just get better subs and spend an extra minute on them to make them decent sandwiches."}
{"text":"NOT FAST AT ALL!!  I ordered over phone waited 20 min later they called me and said they forgot my drink so had to turn back..so I'm like okay at least there getting my drink. 20 mins later the driver calls and ask about my address I give it to her again. 10 min later I get my food. The sub itself was tasteless and horrible like a sub has been sitting out for an hour.    Papa johns took 20 min and they aren't even advertising how fast they are. Only 2 stars because at least they got my drive. Haven't gone to jimmy johns since then."}
{"text":"Worst Jimmy John's in the area... My husband placed an order and after an hour we still didn't have our food... he called and was told there was only one driver and he was out. He was then told our order was on the counter waiting for the drive..( this does not seem safe to me)... The guy he talked to said they would void the order... and deliver it anyway, but could not guarantee when it would get here. We opted to wait. Another hour passed and my husband called back he was then told they had thrown out our food due to it be being voided. My husband then explained they we're supposed to deliver it and it was voided. The girl on the phone told him they would remake the food and as soon as the driver was back we would get the food....another hour and ten minutes passed... we are now over 3 hours waiting.... they finally got here and tried to charge us for the food.... THIS PLACE SUCKS..... NEVER ORDER FROM THEM.... WE WILL NEVER ORDER FROM JIMMY JOHN'S Again....."}
{"text":"Visited Vegas on vacation and since we don't have a Jimmy John's nearby, I decided to take us here! I'll keep it short and sweet. Super clean location, staff was all smiles and super friendly, and the food was delicious! We came in when it was fairly busy and we still got our meals almost quicker than I got my receipt from paying!  Would love to visit this location again. Keep it up everyone!"}
{"text":"Yes these guys are the awesomest shit ever. They gave my friend expert relationship advise as well as all having awesome hair. Specifically I'm talking about the overnight crew.  They are awesome and the bread is the bomb.  I can't say enough good shit about them. Yes."}
{"text":"The service here is well below average for a jimmy johns, bunch of immature kids and I came in at 6:30 plenty of people and wouldn't take $100 bill yet she  didn't even look to see if they had change the \"manager\" said they don't take 100s I told him I didn't have my card with me. They wouldn't help me. It was pretty bs. I'll never return to this jimmy John's ever again. And honestly may not eat at a jimmy John's again or for a considerable amount of time I'll spend my $ at other sandwich shops. And I'm pretty positive they had change when they have the amount of people that had been in there. When it happens to you Panda Express across the parking lot didn't even look at it funny. Accepted my US CURRENCY with a smile!"}
{"text":"I was expecting this place to be bomb.... instead i got a sandwich that i could have just made at home for a quarter of the price."}
{"text":"This location has the WORST delivery record.  Our office is a block a way.  Occasionally they can get sandwiches here in under 30 minutes.  Frequently it takes an hour.  Freaky frustrating!!"}
{"text":"Can't believe this place advertises delivery and they don't deliver to my house which is under 2 miles. They will deliver across the street but I'm \"out of range\". I buy for a family of 7 and they can't drive an extra 10 seconds. Who advertises delivery when 1.9 miles is to far?"}
{"text":"I was super excited to get my sandwhich. After realizing they didn't deliver I drove to pick it up right away... The customer service was amazing but the sandwhich was the opposite. The meat tasted old and not good. I didn't even finish half of it.. I'm really disappointed..."}
{"text":"Worst jimmy johns I have ever been to I will never go back to this one. I'd rather drive another mile to go to a different location. I ordered online everything they charge me for and asked for was on the receipt. The sandwich was made wrong, they offered to remake them but only remade one and it was still wrong"}
{"text":"It was my first time there and the man who seemed to be in charge left a bad taste in my mouth. Upon arrival I was standing there looking at the menu not quite  to the cashier counter and he yells out CASHIER the young girl was wiping the counter and had already made eye contact with me to know I was still deciding. She instantly stopped to come to the counter and just stood there until I ordered. None of the employees had a smirk or smile on their face perhaps because the manager himself didn't have one. It looked like sandwich boot camp in there. I ate half of my sub and didn't like the bread so I asked for slices that i could purchase. The cashier said 50 cents per slice then out of nowhere the man yelled out its not for sale. Needless to say I won't be going back. The manager could use a brush up on customer service skills. It wasn't crowded there wasn't a line he was just an ass. To those poor young employees not all managers are like that, it's ok to smile at customers or just in general."}
{"text":"Much better than Subway especially the tasty french bread the sandwiches are made on! However other than the bread I didn't find anything special about my sub. The location is great-conveniently located downtown near lots of businesses. The service was good and my sub made quickly. The food was nothing special."}
{"text":"I placed an online order at 10AM for delivery just 1/2 mile from this store. after waiting 40 minutes i called the store and was told by a very rude female claiming to be the general manager that they open at 10 but do not start delivery until 1030 but the website does not state this. Multiple issues with this since the manager of the store knew that the website was incorrect but did not seem to care to do anything about it. Secondly the manager was extremely rude. Not freaky fast at all. I will not be returning to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Plain and simple: good staff, quick preparation, nice location, good music. Can't complain about anything. Being close to work, I come by happily maybe once a week."}
{"text":"my favorite chain sandwich shop. the bread isn't cut all the way through, so it doesn't fall apart. the ingredients are fresh. the proportion is just right. its a high quality product. my faves are the turkey and the italian."}
{"text":"I ordered jimmy john's almost every day while attending ASU. They would bike to my campus and deliver to the room I studied in. I would order online and customize my awesome sandwich hours before and it would be there when I was dying of hunger when I asked. The sandwiches are better quality than, say, subway. As a result, expect to pay a little more for that.   Moral of the story: utilize the online ordering."}
{"text":"I have got subs there many times. The staff is very courteous and efficient. They keep the place very clean. My order is prepared very quickly. The bread and all the ingredients are always fresh. This is my favorite sub shop."}
{"text":"I like how they send their delivery driver out without any cash, so he ends up getting a 7 dollar tip on a 7 dollar sandwich. Never ordering food from this place again."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the worst sandwich experience I've had. I'm fairly sure the guy who took the order just got done huffing paint. I had to repeat everything, multiple times, and they still only managed to get one of four sandwiches correct. I've gotten better service in foreign countries where there was literally zero interpretation. Ordered slim turkey, add may and mustard...received slim turkey, dry as f$&k. Ordered turkey Tom, no tomato, add mustard...received turkey Tom, no tomato, no mustard...ordered 2 Italian night clubs on wheat, one hold mayo add mustard, one standard...received 2 on rolls, mayo up the butt on both, almost made me gag just looking at it. So actually, my math is just like their service, sub-par. What I mean is, they got them all wrong, not just three of four...Jesus, what a flop. They should hire the disabled. I won't be back here, and looking at the three star rating, neither should you...."}
{"text":"Good God. I'm never going back.  Ha! April's Fool's.  (Except I'm working on a delayed schedule as today is April 3rd;) This is a great place! We ordered from Jimmy John's and I was delightfully pleased with the experience. Fast, fresh and my name came on my sammie!   Alright, fine. Not such a big deal when you're only ordering two sandwiches. But I can see how this would be helpful if you were ordering for a bunch of folks. The online ordering system was very easy to understand.    https://online.jimmyjohns.com*  The online site changes the sandwich image as you flip thru the menu. Yep, for people who lack imagination. Or, who are hungry with some bourbon in their stomach, this is *fantastic*.    Only ONE sandwich is required to place an order. That's right kids. You don't have to meet some arbitrary $ threshold. (No, you can't call and order a bag of chips.) The fee for our two sandwiches was slightly over $2.   Other neat features Jimmy John's offers is scooping out the bread of the top part of your loaf. I also opted to have my sandwich sliced in half. Sweet! My packets of mustard arrived. I sniffled when mayo did not. (It's alright. I powered through it.)  Jimmy John's Rocks!  * Website: Isn't on this Yelp listing. Helpful Harriet just called Jimmy John on 44th to suggest they add this. I had no idea such a wonderful, delicious service was right here!"}
{"text":"Can we do a negative star? Co worker ordered a sandwich and it took almost 2 hours! She called twice and the manager David was a total jerk! I was shocked by what I heard him tell her. I def will not order from there again due to how they treated her and neither will another department near us after hearing her waiting for almost 2 hours for 1 sandwich! Never offered a refund or anything"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the best subs in Vegas ( I've tried them all) it's the bread. I have ordered party trays twice. This JJ is tucked away across from Costco. Try it! They even brought my tray out to the car. Parking can be tight in the lot. Don't let that stop you!"}
{"text":"I had to wait over an hour and a half for a preordered (online) lettuce wrap. When I called to cancel my order (my lunch break came and went while I was waiting), the customer service rep who answered the phone hung up on me TWICE and then tried to convince me that my sandwich was on the way and I couldn't cancel. When it was finally delivered, the lettuce was slimy and warm as if it had been sitting in the sun or something. This location is super close to my work but after this ordeal and several prior to this one, I will NOT order from them again. Customer service is subpar and shameful."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's had not let me down in the 2 years I've been ordering from them. I'm a student at UNCC and JJ is a staple in my diet. Delivery drivers are always nice without being overly nice or weird. They always call when they're close (which is a huge plus for me since I'm a dorm). Tonight in particular I placed my order in advance online to arrive by 10:45-11pm and the driver called me at 10:41. They are indeed freaky fast! Got the Pepe and did it Unwich style for the first time- no complaints. At first, I was a little pissed that there was only 1 lettuce wrap and thought that I would be starving afterwards but it actually filled me up. And they have some of the most flavorful ham. Lastly, they are extremely reasonably priced- I got the Pepe Unwich delivered and it was only $4.25!"}
{"text":"Love their subs.  Taste like from a deli.  Wish they were in CA!"}
{"text":"My favorite sub shop...the original starting on the campus of Eastern Illinois University.  I am not a fan of Subway, Quizno's, Schlotsky's , Port of Subs, etc.  I love Jimmy's bread and fresh ingredients.  The sign quotes are great too:\"the customer is usually right\", \"your mom wants you to eat at Jimmy John's\",\"We'd love to see you naked but state code requires a shirt and shoes\" ,\"Free Smells\", \"bread so French it must be liberated!\"  This location was a find one day as I was leaving UMC...out patient of course!"}
{"text":"Ordered food for my daughter to be delivered and it was in good timing. However the food had a piece of hair in. Very disappointed and disgusted."}
{"text":"Well, I Love Jimmy Johns #2 and order it very often from the Northlake Mall location. I work uptown and couldn't leave for lunch today so, I ordered from uptown location for delivery and was no where as pleased with sandwich!  They did not follow my order details no extra lettuce, no cucumbers, no vinaigrette, no sprouts,no napkins and finally not cut in half.   Not to mention with tip it was a $10 sandwich that should be made correctly."}
{"text":"been here a couple of times now and have enjoyed our sandwiches every time. you really can tell that the ingredients are fresh. I also appreciate the quickness that the sandwiches are made but I do wish there was a bit less push from the time you order; I always feel like I barely got the tomato removed before my sandwich was complete! Seems trivial and it doesn't stop me from coming back just don't like feeling rushed to spit it all out in one breath is all :)"}
{"text":"Honestly the worse customer service I've ever had I will stop eating at JJ just because of this specific location. Also if you get delivery, order at least a minimum of 1 hour before your lunch break. I made an order at 4pm and got a call an hour later saying that the driver quit and they'll bring it ASAP. I later received my food the time was 5:50pm almost 2 hours later. The sub was soggy and it looked like it was sitting there the whole time before they brought it to me."}
{"text":"Don't be getting no damn attitude because I did not give you a tip, I would have giving him a tip this time but every time this driver comes he has a nasty A$$ attitude.  This will the last damn time I order anything from this Jimmy John's.  This place is less than a 1/2 mile away and they charge for a delivery fee which I have no problem with that at all but the stank a$$ attitude is where I draw the line \"Bad attitude is bad for business\"!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love ordering online because our order shows up and we don't have to deal with the employees. Before I ever stepped foot in the actual brick and mortar location, my husband was telling me how great the sandwiches are. So we found out we could order online one night after we were too exhausted even imagine leaving our house. The food came freakishly fast. And exactly as we'd ordered.   Buuuuut when I came with my son, they were so rude! Any question about the menu is basically answered with, \"look at the menu.\"  I'll continue ordering online and never step foot in store."}
{"text":"Went tonight and the girl there was great! Not fake-bubbly, but authentically nice and did a great job on our unwiches. Thx!!"}
{"text":"Being my first visit to this location I was a little overwhelmed. Jimmy John's is a grab and go sandwich shop, no tables, and just space to stand in the line.  The line was out the door, and for good reason.  The service is quick and the sandwiches are good.  My friend ordered the Italian and I ordered the Country Club. Before I even reached the drink counter my # was called.  I do wish I knew the system, line, how you receive your order(by the # sandwich you ordered), a little better, and do wish there was more space, but the sandwich was great. The Country Club came with turkey, ham, lettuce, tomato and cheese. Bread was fresh, almost warm, and the meats and sides were good. I look forward to getting back, especially on a day I need something quick, and good."}
{"text":"After arriving I realized this location was to go only, and very tiny. After reviewing the board, I attempted to try  to find the end of the line. However, after asking the other customers if they had ordered, I realized there was no line, they were just all waiting, but you couldn't tell b/c there was no sort of organization. Being a \"club sandwich\" lover, b/c of the bacon addition I went with the #11, the Giant Club \"ToGo\". The service was very slow and the employees definitely didn't seem happy to be at work. So, after arriving to my destination to enjoy my sandwich, I had a feeling of disappointment. First, the bread was so stale, I ended up throwing most of it out b/c is was too hard to eat. Second, and more disappointing, I didn't receive the club I ordered.  I basically received a lettuce, mayo, cheese, and a slice of ham sandwich,  no turkey & NO bacon :-(.  Overall, very disappointing experience. As Jeff said, I'll stick with Jersey Mike's!"}
{"text":"I live in water st. A jimmy johns driver almost hit me when I was pulling out of my driveway because he was in such a hurry that he went up onto the curb to get around me. why are you driving so fast thru a neighborhood??   Watch out for this jimmy johns driver - silver car. NV plate number 821-ANY.   A$$hole driver!!!"}
{"text":"I'm always stoping by a Jimmy's when I get the chance. I have only come here a handful of times with my boyfriend and each time I've been dissatisfied. Whether it's poor service, or hard bread there's nothing great about this location. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Truth in advertising can be found at Jimmy John's.  They really are freakin' fast.  I come here a lot for lunch during the work week because sometimes I only have 30 minutes to spare.  During Lent, I had the #6 veggie sub more than once, but my usual order is the #2, the Big John roast beef sandwich with easy mayo.  Perusing the nutritional info this week, I learned that the veggie sub has more calories and more saturated fat than the roast beef sub--hmmm, more reason for me to stick to the #2.  This is the only place I've been where I've seen employees running in and out of the restaurant--they're delivering those subs as fast as they can!  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Got most of my order wrong.after correcting it twice found out that the bread was stale and meat tasted off for #2"}
{"text":"I love jimmy johns bread and usually the sandwiches but this one is very poorly managed. The guys behind the counter were complaining loudly when the phone rang with a to go order. My sprouts in my sandwich were thrown on in two big clumps. Unprofessional behavior from the kids making the sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love there sandwiches and the workers are awesome.  I always call in my orders,  they know me by name and what I usually order.  I go there at least 2 times a week and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Got out of the Grog Shop Saturday night and got caught in the rain. It was a pretty nice night to be out. Starving. Waiting to get picked up. Was going to hit BK on the way home. Then I meandered down Coventry. Winking Lizard was already empty, Panini's was full of losers, and the fire alarm was going off in the parking garage. I was starting to get agitated. Then I saw Jimmy John's. Open at almost one a.m., looking clean, bright and organized. I got in, ordered some subs and had a seat to look out at the rain and tweet(yeah, sorry, I do that). Before I knew it my subs were ready. I got the 8\" vegetarian for me wife and the double sized Italian Night Club with salami, capicola, awesome vinaigrette and provolone. Shared with the dog in the car on the way home. It was really tasty. Service was so friendly despite the late night drunk crowd. Top of the game on Coventry."}
{"text":"We got this at work the other day and I ordered \"The Gargantuan\" sandwich and jalepeno chips.  They screwed up and gave me buffalo, er, I mean BBQ chips.  The sandwich itself was loaded with meat.  The bread was a bit tough- not like Mr. Goodcents, but the ladies at work liked that.  Something tasted a little funny on this sandwich.... I can't quite put my finger on it, but it was just a little off.  Overall it wasn't bad, but I'm not in love with this place either."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Jimmy John's.  Except this one is open until 3am and basically has a monopoly on the late night food thing here in Old Town.  Smart."}
{"text":"When I am hungry hungry I call Jimmy Johns because THEY ARE FAST FAST. AND SO GOOD. I have never unwrapped a sandwich that was not still hot and not soggy. Every time it is perfectly built to my order. Jimmy Johns is what delivery should be. Thank You J J's"}
{"text":"If you're looking for freaky fast delivery with average custom service look elsewhere. This location has the worst custom service. I encourage anyone thinking about placing a delivery order to find someplace to order food from or drive there yourself. You will get it faster.   Knowing this place is terrible at delivering food in a timely fashion, I ordered at 10:30am for a noon lunch. It's 12:30 and still no sub. When I called the employee told me that they were busy and my order is going out with the next driver. I explained that I placed the order 90 minutes prior so they shouldn't have had any issues getting to me on time. He said I ordered it for noon, not earlier. People as rude as this should find a job that doesn't require custom service."}
{"text":"Placed a catering order for a work function to be at our offices by 11:30. Standing here in the store now at 12:25. We were told multiple times that the sandwiches were on the way for almost an hour before we decided to just drive and pick them up. They are still preparing the order. When we got here we were met with nothing but excuses. Joke is on me though, because this has happened once before when ordering at this location."}
{"text":"three stars just becuase if you order after at 2pm or after is takes well over an hour to get your sandwich!!!!!!!!!!  It was warm and yucky.  If I didn't feel so bad for the driver, I would have refused it."}
{"text":"Inhaled my first Jimmy John's sub this past Wednesday and not only did it taste great but the price point was lower than any sandwich in Downtown.   I opted for the tuna, added cheese for 75 cents and *still* escaped having paid about $5.50 for an 8-inch sandwich. Great value.  What I like best about Jimmy John's is the bread. Growing up in Minnesota my favorite sandwich shop was a place called Erbert and Gerbert's and Jimmy John's bread is almost an exact match. In fact, their subs are a perfect hybrid of E&G and Cousins.  Beyond the tasty sandwich I thought the staff was incredibly friendly and the music was surprisingly bangin'. Might have been Taylor Dayne on the stereo, I can't quite recall. Seating inside the shop is a little tight but if you head outside you can chill out with Five Guys Burgers & Fries patrons and enjoy the hustle and bustle of Washington Street."}
{"text":"\"Subs so fast you'll freak\"... What a joke! I placed a delivery order at 5pm and received a confirmation email that my order would be arriving to me shorty. An hour passed and I still had not received it so I called Jimmy John's and they told me my sandwich was en route and would be at my house in 10 minutes. Twenty minutes later I still had no delivery and called and canceled. I have never had any problems with any other Jimmy johns location and needless to say I will never order from 44th street location again."}
{"text":"I only have three words for this sub shop... Best Sandwich EVER! It was a fast and affordable, amazing and delicious lunch I had there today. The employees were all happy and singing with the upbeat music. Frankly it was a great experience. This was my first time going to a Jimmy John's, but after today I will be a regular customer"}
{"text":"I tried Jimmy John's for the first time today and it was gross. The sandwich tasted like it was cold and was made hours ago after warming it up in the microwave it was decent. Also the staff was so rude I walked in and nobody said hi to me even when I walked out nobody said bye. The lady behind the counter also made me bag my own food even though I couldn't reach the bags and no idea what she was talking about and there was like seven employees just standing behind the counter chatting away worst experience ever.  P.S. My boyfriend got sick after."}
{"text":"Love me some JJ's!   I think I got my sandwich made in about 28 seconds today.   Good location, good music. Staff seems nice.   This is my favorite chain sub shop."}
{"text":"Let's get the straight first, I love Jimmy John's. The one in Scottsdale is amazing and my go to for lunch. But this location by my house is complete garbage.  This place is unreal and ran by incompetent employees.   I ordered delivery today and the order was taken as normal. It takes the driver over an hour to get my order to my house which is just 1.4 miles away. She got lost repeatedly and called me three times asking for directions. When she got here I still had to pay the bill.   Sandwiches were great. But we didn't order enough.   I called back and asked to get the same order again, and this dude tells me that I'm out of their delivery area.... what in the actual f&*k are you talking about? How? Your lost driver was just at my house. This is the third time I've had a delivery to my house and now they can't delivery after they completely wrecked my last order.   I don't own a business, but I can tell you this is downright asinine, and if I did I, would train my employees to know right from wrong and what makes sense.   So dumb. Just really really dumb."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this location. I live and work fairly close to this location (1.14miles away) and order from them quite frequently. The staff is always polite and they deliver both to my home and work \"freaky fast\".  Food is always fantastic which is what Ive come to expect from this Jimmy John's location!  They are great for catering as well! I have used them for a couple of baby shower events and its so convenient and surprisingly well priced!"}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is great.  It's fast, it's cheap, it's a chain, you can find them anywhere.  Reviewed just so they'd have a better than 3 star rating.    Also, I lost ~10lbs on the unwich diet this summer.  Subway has nothing on JJ's...  What's an unwich, you ask? Allow me to enlighten you.  It's lettuce subbed  in for the bread.  I made fun of people that ordered them.  Until I tried it.  Holy fat kid at skinny camp, these are good.  It's actually all I get when I go there now...It's ~400 calories of lettuce-wrapped delightfulness.    I go for the #11, unwich, add sprouts, cukes, oregano, hot peppers, ez mayo, ez dijon.  Other favorites are #8, #12, & #14.  You can't really go wrong here."}
{"text":"Jimmy johns is the place to go for a quick lunch or dinner. Consistent flavor, fresh ingredients but the service was not as fast as I've had at other JJs. They might have been training a new worker so I'll give them a pass. :) I always get the #13 which is the Veggie but it's more like a cheese and avocado sammie than anything since I don't like sprouts or tomatoes. It's enough for two meals but you can get a smaller one for about a $1 less but just pay the extra $1 and make two meals out of it. I love their BBQ chips and they have the coolest reusable cups."}
{"text":"We are huge fans of jimmy John's - we order it on a regular basis for work and home HOWEVER THIS LOCATION has really disappointed us. It takes a lot for me to write a bad review. We have been ordering for work at least 3-4 times per week for delivery. Long story short, the delivery driver never showed (was lost at another delivery) and after 50mins of waiting I went to pick it up myself. I had called the store to be SURE my order was still there or if it was enroute (it was still there according to their staff). When i showed up at the store there was no order. They offered to make my food again (duh that's why i'm there) however were very annoyed when i asked them to not charge me for the delivery fee and tip i placed for the driver. (i'm not paying for delivery if i have to pick it up myself! again DUH!) She slammed my cups on the counter and then offered to make my lunch for free- however even with that (which i did appreciate) they did not even make my food how i ordered it- all it was was meat and lettuce. It's very unfortunate because now they've lost a long time and frequent customer. This is not the first experience we've had along these same lines - probably more like the 4th or 5th. Hope they can get their stuff together or they're going to loose a lot more customers. Also, never was there a manager available to discuss with."}
{"text":"We called in an order for pick up. t was ready by the time we got there 5 blocks away. The subs were great and the price was reasonable. We ordered pick up because there is a delivery fee."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are always good here but the big problem is the service.  First of all the people working there look like they just cut class to come and work.  Yesterday I go there and I had to tell the cashier three times my order. It was a simple order.  Just ham bacon and mayo.  I must have waited a good 10 to 15 minutes for my sandwich.  It looks like complete chaos behind the counter.  They had a big order and didn't remember who it belonged to.  Almost gave five sandwiches to the wrong person.  So when I finally get my food, they just said have a nice day.  Not oh I'm sorry for the wait, here is a free drink.  I left aggravated.  They need to get rid of these teenagers working and get some qualified responsible adults like a regular food establishment."}
{"text":"My husband ordered a sandwich at 6:12pm... by 6:42 we called and were told they had \"a bunch of orders come in at once\" and the driver would be there any moment. By 6:51 I called and spoke with the manager Chris who gave me the same lame excuse and stated she would call the driver. She then told me the drive was \"right near us\" and I requested my delivery charge be deducted after waiting 40 minutes now... she said she will not do that and if I didn't want to pay the delivery charge they will not be delivering my sandwich. Clearly new management is needed here to make sure customers keep coming back... maybe someone with less excuses and more accountability. The order just arrived... 7:05pm... 50 minutes later. Will NEVER order from here again."}
{"text":"I used to eat at this location quite often at my old job.   We received a few hours notice that corporate was going to be by work, and said they were covering lunch for the 35 of us. What options did we have? Given that we were making calls at 7:30am, we ran into bar or fast food as our options. Then the light bulb illuminated my mind and realized we could try Jimmy John's. If they make freaky good food, freaky fast... could they make 35 lunches in a freaky fast time?  Why yes, yes they could! We placed our order on line, which went very smoothly, and indicated our desired pick up time a couple hours ahead of time.   I went to pick up the food and as I walked in the door, they were literally wrapping up the last box lunch and packing the 4th box of sandwiches up. After paying the staff was very gracious to help carry everything out to the car with me.  The food was a hit with everybody at work, so delicious, as always! Can't wait until we have last minute lunch needs again!"}
{"text":"I love JJ's! It's a borderline obsession and I am pretty certain they put crack in their guac.  I ALWAYS order the beach club - it's so delicious! The staff is always friendly and the sandwiches are made to order quickly.  Why only 3 stars? Their delivery area is whack. I am sure this company is doing just fine in the profits area, but they are excluding tons of homes by having such a limited delivery area. I live quite close, but their cut-off is at Seven Hills Dr. and Horizon Ridge, which is crazy.   Anyhow, otherwise everything is great and I frequent this location."}
{"text":"I still love JJ's, but I need to remove a star due to their RIDICULOUS delivery area.  I tried to order online, for delivery. I entered my address (same zip code, only about 2 miles away) and it told me they don't deliver there.  The last time I was in the shop, I asked where they deliver, because this seems crazy to me.  Apparently, they only deliver to Gibson/215, East to Warm Springs (I think) and South to Greenway.  Greenway is 1 block from me.  So, you're telling me that the snot nosed teenager can't drive 1 more block to bring me a sandwich?  Mmmmkay then, makes total sense.  When I was in college, our local JJ's drivers all rode bikes.  If that were the case here, I could understand.....  Other than that, I still love their sandwiches.  The turkey tom, beach club and veggie are my faves."}
{"text":"Ate at this location two times in a row.  I love the #4 (turkey, sprouts) on wheat bread.  Love the fresh seven grain bread, turkey and cheese.  These sandwiches are way better than Subway, etc.    During yesterday's (Friday) visit, the staff were heard singing along to the music playing, which was nice to see/hear.  It's nice to see people enjoying their jobs.   Today, I had ordered my food through the drive thru.  My one of two sandwiches ordered was made incorrectly using French roll rather than wheat bread.  The staff were quick to fix the minor mistake.   Great sandwiches, nice staff..just wish there was a location in the Aliante area but worth the drive."}
{"text":"Not worried about delivery.  I am concerned about what goes in my face and these sandwiches are always \"Top Drawer\"."}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns serve sandwiches at good prices. They make them really fast. (In seconds?) I just think they are a little boring, hence they are not getting 5 stars from me. At subway you can customize the sandwich to your liking while here it's more like you pick the one you want and hopefully it's good. I'm sure I could have told them to put extra stuff on it, but it was only my second time here so wasn't sure how the system worked and I didn't want to be the difficult customer during lunch rush hour.   Good sandwiches for the money though.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Don't get why some people think JJ's is so hot.  Ordered a simple sub with no onions and add peppers.  What do I get?  A metric crapload of onions, no peppers.  So I fixed that, but the thing was still \"meh\".  So-so bread, so-so meat quality & quantity, not particularly tasty, not particularly bad.  Very unmemorable.  Jersey Mike's makes a much better \"chain\" sandwich than these guys.  I'll give JJ one more shot, but won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"These knucklers get 5 stars for clever marketing, and 2 for the food. Sorry, just not impressed at all. SLIGHTLY better than that \"other\" huge chain that advertises sandwiches with 4x more meat than they actually give you (how do they get away with that??), but only slightly. Long, skinny sandwiches that cleverly hide the fact that they're not as big as they look. Marginal-quality meats. Overpriced for what you get. There are better options out there."}
{"text":"It was 4 pm and I was the only customer in the store.  Three young guys behind the counter laughing and telling stories...one turned around and took my order and paid, the sandwich was laying beside the cash register...no question of what bread I wanted or how I wanted it dressed.  I really wished I could have another dressing on the sandwich...I guess they make it one way..  No glass was handed to me...I figured out To get it myself.  No napkins...I found those by going toward the back and reaching over the counter into the kitchen area...by the time I grabbed my sandwich and drink they were all turned around laughing and joking.  I'm still wondering where the drink lids and straws were.  The sandwich was okay...nothing special. Going to Quiznos.  I won't be back to JJ."}
{"text":"The food here is just okay. I order from this location several times a month and the delivery drivers are always fast and friendly, but the food is not quite up to par. They pile on the lettuce to avoid putting enough meat on all the sandwiches and the bread is always hard."}
{"text":"Holy smokes, I've never had such horrible service as I did today. I went in for lunch and waited a long time for one sandwich. The sandwich wasn't correct and the woman gave me a hard time accompanied by a dirty look about getting it cut in half. I will not return to this location again...."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our kids first time to Phoenix, Arizona(Vacation)We were all hungry, we decided to get something to eat before arriving to the Hotel. We decided to eat at Jimmy John's. So we walked in and the lady on the Front said, what would you like? First of all, let us see the Menu first. What a nice welcoming. So I started to order my food choice, when of a sudden she says, \"we are closing in 45 minutes\" ( with a rude voice)just like that, like... should I take it like, hurry up or we will kick you out in 45 minutes even though your not finished? We were so hungry I said Okayy, that's fine. So I ordered. The sandwiches were so different than Subway Sandwiches. Jimmy Johns bread were hard, not soft. Oh well we ordered our sandwiches because like I said, we were hungry. After I ordered, two other groups came in and she said the same thing to them, not Welcome to Jimmy John's but we are closing in so and so minutes to them. (With a rude voice)So I decide to order another sandwich to go, so I went back to her, same girl. Than She said, we will  be closing in 12 minutes( with a rude voice), I looked at her like really! Don't you know that you told me that already, and I'm sitting with my family right there in front of her, which I ordered already before. Ugh! My family and I felt as we had a time to order our food, get our food, and eat with a time limit Her name is Belanna, that's what my receipt says that took my order. I was going to tell her something, but I did have my kids with me, I was tired and didn't want her to add something to my sandwiches. If you know what I mean Not going back!!"}
{"text":"I know this Jimmy John's is a very fast-paced one being near the dental school and UMC and whatnot, but I've ordered from Jimmy John's plenty of times and never had a problem with being delivered my sandwich wherever I've worked.   I just started working at the dental school and noticed one day that the Jimmy John's was about two blocks away so I thought, what the hell, I'll order a sandwich via online delivery.   I put pretty specific instructions in my order and asked them to deliver to the 'Front' of the school in the main parking lot. The delivery was pretty quick (about 12 minutes) and I tried answering the call from the delivery guy but I had bad reception inside the school. I went outside because I figured he'd be waiting in front.   It took a couple minutes but he finally came around the lot and seemed a little bothered. He told me that they usually deliver to the back of the school (on the opposite side of campus) so it makes it easier for them. I was little confused because I was being told to where to pick up my sandwich instead of going by my initial instructions. I just told the guy sorry it's my first time ordering from them at this location. Guess I'm bringing my lunch from now on!"}
{"text":"A Thursday night, 15 mins before closing. I've had a beer or 12 since i came off the links that afternoon, and no food. I know i dont need to be eating so late, but dammit, i was hungry, and when i walked by Jimmy Johns on the way to the hotel, well . . . walked in, and was greeted w/ a smile. Ordered a club sammie, and as i collected my change at the register, the gal on sammie duty was handing me my order, tightly wrapped for the walk back. Friendly team, clean place? Check. Tasty sammie? Hell yeah! That's an easy 4-stars.  Cheers! RS"}
{"text":"Chose to order JJ delivery for lunch in the park with the kids. Order went in before noon, it's 1:40 and no JJ. Manager says new driver..."}
{"text":"I gave these people such a low score not because of the food. This store hires the biggest a-holes ever. I never have the issues in any other store but this one the people who work there suck. I wish it wasn't on my way home from work I think ok today will be fine and low and behold they have hired a less appealing personality than the last one I experienced. Who hires these nasty people?????"}
{"text":"I have heard about Jimmy John's since they opened in Phoenix recently.  I finally stopped in for lunch one day.  It was kind of busy.  There were a lot of people standing around waiting for food and all the tables were taken.  There is absolutely no where to stand and wait for food without being in someone's way.  They need a better system!  And then as you are standing around, you can not even understand the person who is yelling out which sandwich is ready to be picked up.  us customers kept looking at each others saying, \"what'd he say?\"  \"Is that yours or mine?\"  I couldn't believe I spent $8 for just a basic sandwich, a pickle, and a bottle of water.  Seemed a bit much if you ask me.  (Although I did like that they sold big pickles!  Yum!)  It was a good sandwich, but a little expensive for a basic lunch sandwich.  Hell, even $4 would have been too much in my opinion. It was good, but I'm not rushing back anytime soon to spend $10 on a sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"Decent sandwich since I am normally a fan or Jimmie johns. However, this location has pretty slow service. Makes me wonder if its new staff on training? Ive been to this location about 6 times now and each time its been about the same. I order either the Beach club or the tuna salad club, both are very delicious. The only other complaint that I have is that my beach club and the hunter club that my friend get are thinner (less meat and filling wise) then what i am normally used to from other Jimmie Johns."}
{"text":"I love your subs Jimmy Johns.  The bread is super yummy and I love that its convenient and fast.  I just have one (perhaps crazy) pet peeve.  Is there a reason you always have to put tomatoes right on the bread? Seriously, there is nothing appetizing about soggy bread and it always baffled me that you do this."}
{"text":"What a joke 1.64 miles away and don't deliver I guess Jimmy John's is not ever getting my business again!!"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's does amazing sandwiches. Truly delicious on bread that is freshly baked. This location is no different.  In the middle of the peak lunch rush, there were six or so register workers and sandwich makers in the kitchen area, so my \"number two\" didn't take very long at all. The guy managed to upsell me to adding cheese to the sandwich and making it into a combo. This was brilliant on his part and not so much on mine. It turned a $4.75 sub sandwich into a $9.01 meal - nearly doubling the price. Be wary!  It's the only food shop in this shopping plaza, but there are several other businesses in here that make the small parking lot into a very busy one. You can only get in and out from Sharon Road, so if you're on Fairview you'll want to go past, make the right before Phillips Place, and drive around to get onto Sharon, rather than try making a U-turn.  This is a take-away location only. There are no seats inside or outside. Which makes your buck and a half 20 ounce Diet Coke very expensive.  If I return, it will only be to get a great sandwich. I'll skip the \"combo\" that adds three bucks for a bag of chips and a fountain soda."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a sandwich and they did a quick job. Number 2, no mayo, add dijon, add cucumbers, slice in half. Ready for pickup in less than 60 seconds.  The shop is clean and the staff seemed very capable. I wonder if this one is close enough to deliver to my house? Nope."}
{"text":"I visit these guys at least twice per week. They are always super nice and super friendly. I find it hard to believe that there are so many bad reviews below. I mean seriously - one star because you didn't get sprouts? Geez.   I will keep going here regularly. No issues at all. Thanks for making my lunch all the time."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are tiny and have very little meat. They are about 1/2 the size of Subway's sandwiches. The bread was hard and stale and they forgot to give me everything on my order for take out. At least the staff was nice. Will not return."}
{"text":"Super quick delivery love the BLT. I always order and they have alway got it right. The only down side is it costs a few dollars more to order online, but worth it"}
{"text":"How can you not love Jimmy John's? Their service really is freaky fast. All of the ingredients on the sandwiches are fresh and made to order and the service is exceptional. Employees are always nice and helpful and willing to give suggestions on sandwiches. The facilities are always clean and a couple of them even have drive-through's! The fact that a made-to-order sandwich shop can get your order done that fast is impressive!"}
{"text":"I finally stopped at JJ's for lunch and boy, oh boy, was I not disappointed.  After reviewing the sandwich options, I ordered #12 Beach Club (fresh baked turkey breast, provolone cheese, avocado spread, sliced cucumber, sprouts, lettuce, tomato, and mayo).  The sandwich was absolutely, positively delicious.  I also had the JJ's Thinny Chips which are 40% less fat than regular chips, no trans fats and no cholesterol along with some sweet teat.  The chips were also fabulous but the tea was, well, I will get something else the next time.  I was very pleased with my meal and now, I cannot wait to go back over towards Concord Mills with an empty stomach.      My apologies, I ate the sandwich before thinking about capturing a photo.  It was that good!    JJ's has a drive through window which was quite busy, but the service was really fast, and they have delivery as well."}
{"text":"This is the slowest Jimmy Johns ever. I think it would have been faster for me to go to the store but the ingredients and go home and make it myself.   It also wasn't very clean today. Normally it's much nicer inside. This could also be because they got hit hard for spring training."}
{"text":"The staff members are very immature at this Jimmy John's. I came here for the first time with my little brother who I have not spent time with in a long time. We both took a second to look at the menu, instead of offering us help the staff started to giggle like five-year-olds children because we were confused about what to order. Which is normal I would think, being that the place had such a confusing board. After, ordering I just did not feel welcome there at all I ate my food fast, and we left. I hate ignorant people."}
{"text":"I don't know how accurate this review could be.  I was hammered when I ate here.  But as far as hammered food goes around ASU, this is a nice change of pace from a burrito.  So good for you JJ."}
{"text":"we made an online order and the Sandwiches were ready as requested and tasty as always.  The bread they use is what makes their sub sandwiches great.  When I went to pick up the sandwiches the place was very busy but my order was double checked by the cashier and I was out the door in a flash."}
{"text":"I love JJ!  I have had the #16 Club Lulu for lunch more than a handful of times in the last month.  They are truly freaky fast and the sandwich is always delicious and fulfilling.   Have you ever been in the bathroom of a Jimmy Johns?  I don't know about the men's room or any other locations, but I discovered Facts About Uranus at my feet at this particular location.  Always good for a smile! Just wander into any of their locations and read what they have on their walls, you will surely be entertained.  OH! And don't forget to get a yummy sandwich!"}
{"text":"I only put three stars because of the service. Everything at Jimmy Johns you can get at Subway. I personally don't like cold subs. First visit ever at a Jimmy Johns, great customer service, the inside was clean. Although, we did pull into the parking where about four cops were parked outside arresting someone. Excitement really, but not something I wanted to see while going to a new place for me to eat my food.."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are ok here. I've had better. They put way too much lettuce on the subs, even when you ask for less. Maybe the key is no lettuce? The bread is good though and I do love the pickles."}
{"text":"It's alright.. I'm new in town and he HUBBZ and I were trying to find lunch. I asked what the difference in regular 8inch and the club sandwiches, the guy informed me that they were both 8inch sandwiches but the club versions had more meats.  I ordered the \"beach club\" it was good, but the only \"extra\" anything it seemed I got was lettuce. It was more of a salad on it than a serving of lettuce, and shredded lettuce annoys me actually so that's a second negative thing about the sandwich.  My HUBBZ got the Italian club one And he said it was really good, so maybe I just chose the wrong one today.  The bread is reallllllly good, I'm a huge fan of French bread. Maybe next time I go I'll ordered something else or ask for \"easy\" lettuce."}
{"text":"I can see this location from my office window...it's always there...taunting me with it's neon signs.  I look at the sad little cup o' noodles I brought for lunch...then I look back at Jimmy John's....and before I know it I'm beginning an online order.  I can't help it.    Their commercials say they deliver \"subs so fast you'll freak\" and they ain't kiddin'.  Today 5-20-16 we got our order in about ten minutes!  The sammiches are always tasty and fresh.  My favorites are the \"big john\", \"totally tuna\" and \"turkey tom\".    If you like pickles you gotta try theirs...they're amazing! They remind me of Claussen pickles but they are fresh and bright green and so wonderful.  A whole one is $1.25 but soooo worth it.    I'm takin' off one star because every single time I've ordered from here there has been at least one thing wrong.  The first time, the sprouts were missing.  The second time, they forgot my pickle.  Today, my sandwich was missing the mustard.  They are efficient but apparently not detail-oriented."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best customer service I have ever had at a Jimmy Johns. The employees went above and beyond to make sure our sandwich's were perfect and my kids were happy.  The actual owners of the franchise were there and showing an interest in the quality of food! They made sure we were happy with our and so humble working hard side by side with their employees .  I will drive out of my way to this location for all of my Jimmy Johns orders.   Thank you"}
{"text":"Love this place! The sandwiches are always delicious and I've never had a problem with their delivery service.   I've tried the roast beef here, the Vito and the beach club. So far, the beach club is my favorite. I love the taste of the turkey with the avocado! It's so yummy! Their bread is to die for as well!   I love ordering from them because they're super fast and so inexpensive!   I might love this place more than subway... and that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a quick #4 Turkey w/ cheese and got everything I was expecting . Quick , friendly service . The inside is very spacious and clean , very nice overall . Food was good , standard Jimmy John's . The bathroom was also very clean, which I find important, it shows the the cleanliness of the restaurant. The location is a bit tricky to get to coming off of 79. Other than that ,it was a great experience that will keep me coming back !"}
{"text":"Fantastic service. I submitted an on-line order and an hour later I did not get my delivery (they did try to deliver). I provided the wrong contact number, so entirely my fault. When I called to see what happened, the employee who answered the phone was extremely helpful and they re-made PLUS delivered my order at no additional charge. Now that is some serious customer service!!"}
{"text":"Very fast service and great delivery people. Perfect on a cold day you don't want to leave the office. There aren't a lot of great options within walking distance near me and Jimmy John's has never failed me. Granted this is generally for speed over quality, but when you're in the mood it beats something greasier, and it is a fairly customizable.  However, their customer service today is slipping. For the first time, the receptionist - who did have a hard time with English - got my order wrong. I asked for a Country Club and got a Club Lulu, which is bacon not ham.   I called and the manager was not apologetic. \"It says here you ordered a Club Lulu.\" but I had never heard of the sandwich before, so how could I have ordered it? No I don't want to wait another 10 minutes for the right sandwich, just apologize and give a longstanding customer a rebate/free sandwich on their next order. That'll cost you less and be better customer service, and I'll still be sure to tip well. (I shouldn't have to tip twice for the same sandwich, nor should some nice delivery guy not get a tip. My guess is they have turnover problems)   Two strikes and you are almost out; it's almost springtime and walking doesn't look so bad. I won't be so merciful on the update."}
{"text":"I am giving two stars for the service and nice atmosphere. However, the sandwich that I had was gross. Low quality ingredients (I should have expected that). It was better than subway across the street, but won't eat here again. I can make better sandwiches at home."}
{"text":"I love me some Jimmy. I'm now on a low carb diet and what do you know? Jimmy Johns to the rescue! I can still get my favorite #9 Italian Night Club in an unwhich, which is your sandwhich wrapped in a veggie hug of lettuce.    I've always been a fan of JJ, and this location is in a nice up and coming shopping area near my Gym. The guys working there were friendly, and of course 'freaky fast', I'll be back for my favorite sub!"}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns use to be an every Tue lunch deal for me. Me and a boyfriend at the time, used to come here before an afternoon at santan village In Gilbert. The employees were soo friendly/funny. They knew us and our order soo good, as we walked In, they would all yell \"Hi\" and before we left \"Bye\" really loud!! Made me laugh so hard Everytime!! Ya ya little things keep me entertained but It was really cute!  I love how your order Is ready, well for us before we even finished saying what we wanted!!!  And they would come talk to us like friends. Very friendly, and fun. Waaaay better then subway and much better bread! The only thing I'm sad about Is they took away the sprouts!! So sometimes I just bring my own if I know I'm gonna stop here. Yes I always have sprouts at home, I love them on salads and wraps! But please bring them back! This place Is epic 10 stars!!"}
{"text":"Why is the staff at this location so mean? So uninterested in giving at least some basic customer service? When I come to this location for lunch everyone seems to hate their jobs. But other than that the food is comparable to any other JJs."}
{"text":"I was so thrilled that a JJ finally opened on the East side. I have been a few times now and it's always a great experience. Everyone is super friendly and courteous and the sandwiches are just great."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches but it is frustrating when the sassy drive through cashier keeps asking you if you want extra sauce and there isn't any sauce on the sandwich...then she gets an attitude when my husband ask, \"what sauce?\" (she meant extra oil). Her behavior was so unwarranted that I wouldn't eat the sandwich 'cuz I figure if she's coops attitude about her own trivial mistake she'd do something or have something nasty done to our sandwich. I would have cancelled my order and left. My husband did not. He paid and the rude woman continued being snotty, glaring at my husband and not speaking to him. When she handed my husband back his card she had her back turned towards him...WTF? The last time I drove though at the same shop and the female drive through cashier copped an attitude I said, \"you know, never mind, I'll go somewhere else.\" I won't be back (2 bad experiences is more than enough for me). Strongly recommend customer service training for the staff at this location...JJ's has always been a positive and friendly experience, the women in your drive through leave much to be desired.    Make what ever excuses you like for your staff. Last week my co-workers and I were going to lunch...they suggested your Jimmy Johns location. I told them of my recent experiences and they decided it wasn't worth the hassle. There are too many great restaurants and sandwich places to enjoy lunch (including other Jimmy Johns) that your location or supporting your business directly isn't necessary. She's sassy, and I'm not talking about her being sassy in a  cute way. She was sassy not once but twice and that's not good for business."}
{"text":"Order lunch today Tuna fish sub sandwich very little tuna maybe 1/2 teaspoon if that much  Bread was hard maybe a tablespoon of lettuce Veggie sub very little veggies bread hard"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in today at around 1 the place is dead so you'd expect we'd get a greeting as we walk in, NOPE. Instead, I got stared down by the red haired lady working the register who seemed as if me walking into the establishment ruined her whole mood. As I'm ordering my food this lady is sighing and rolling her eyes because my 3 sandwiches and 2 pickles was such an annoying order for her to take. Of course after we ordered my boyfriend said thank you and she rolled her eyes at him and walked away, and proceeded to give us dirty looks from afar. All I know is I will not be coming back to this jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"Wow!  Less than $5 for a delicious vegetarian sandwich!?!  YES!  The bread was tough on the outside, soft on the inside; just how I like it.  The veggies were fresh and packed to the max in my sandwich.  The cheese was also quite tasty.  I drove here on break from a training class to pick up sandwiches at my instructor's request.  I am so glad I did!  YUM!  This place was so good I had to ask twice to verify that it really is a chain!  You just don't get food this good every day.  Best of all, on a busy Saturday at lunch time in Phoenix, I was more than mildly impressed that my subs were ready and I was in and out in less than 15 minutes.  Chips were good too, but I'll skip 'em next time and focus my love on the sandwich.  :)"}
{"text":"Not sure this store lives up to their slogan of fast delivery. Will not deliver to you unless you are super close to them. Guess 2.5 miles away is too far away for them. Very disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I'll admit.  I was looking through the menu the very first time I stepped into a Jimmy John's (they don't have these in California or the east coast), and thought this place was crap.  So I decided to go here one drunk night of partying and ordered the Gargantuan.  Wow!  I hadn't had subs this good in a long time.  They make it very quick and it beats the hell out of those underachievers at Subway.  I feel sorry for those cheap fools who decide to go to Subway despite knowing they have a much better place nearby that doesn't even need to toast their subs to be deliciously good."}
{"text":"This Jimmy John's is the bomb dot com  Freaky fast every time, I never wait for sandwiches here"}
{"text":"We showed up late at night and the lady working dropped everything she was doing and help us like it was no inconvenience at all. Great sandwich."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's.  But this one is terrible. My meat was old and my husband ended up with food poisoning.  CHOOSE A DIFFERENT LOCATION!"}
{"text":"Overall must say it is good  for fast food-sandwich shop and extremely fast delivery at a price that I can handle. you can't go wrong, who else is going to bring you a spicy Italian cold cut 15 minutes after you get off the phone ordering it"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money on a jimmy johns sandwich. There is nothing special about these sandwiches. This is the worst sandwich shop I have been to. You will get a better sandwich by making one at home."}
{"text":"Good subs but out of four delivery requests, two were performed within 10 minutes, one was right at 20 minutes and the last one took 35 minutes!! I can't be critical of the drivers as they did their very best, but I am very critical of this particular Jimmy John's management as they should make sure that an adequate number of drivers are available. (BTW, this JJ location is 0.7 mile from the requested destination location.) The two unacceptably late deliveries occurred approximately five weeks apart so these miscues cannot be blamed on a single unusual event. Freaky fast, my butt!!!"}
{"text":"I would eat at Jimmy Johns every day if I could.   Great atmosphere, employees are all quick to say hello! \"Subs So fast you'll freak\" is more than just a slogan - by the time I paid for my sub and filled up my cup with my drink, the sandwich was done and in front of me.   To top it off, the food is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Worst Jimmy Johns experience ever.  Typically, a reliable choice at all other locations.  Only time I've been to this location.  Hope the management or owner takes note of the abysmal service and quality shown in photo.  Photo is the BLT for family member recovering at CMC hospital.  Hospital cafeteria is a significant upgrade.  Apparently u can't give zero stars.  I should have simply thrown the money on the ground for what ridiculously slow service and product I received."}
{"text":"Best subs.   Gave capriotis a try today. Huge mistake. I will keep coming to jimmy johns! :)"}
{"text":"I used to get Jimmy Johns all of the time when I was down at the good ol' UofA, so now that I work on Mill I was excited to try them again! I don't know if this location is different, if my taste buds have evolved since I was 19, or if I have to be completely shit faced to eat here, but this place is ewwwwww Like others have said, they use way to much mayo. WAY TOO MUCH. And no other condiment really... Their subs consist of 90% lettuce/sprouts, 8% mayo and 2% misc(meaning mystery meat, tomatoes, maybe cheese, etc) I just don't get why anyone would want to eat here? Unless they're drunk! I would totally eat here drunk, but then again, I'll eat ANYTHING when I'm drunk..."}
{"text":"Good as other JJ's I tried in Cincinnati.   Polite and fast service.   Restrooms were open and clean."}
{"text":"I just received my super fast sandwich. I ordered the Veggie--no mayo, add sprouts. It is wonderful and everything I expected from you guys! The sandwich is fresh and delicious. I ordered chips and a pickle too. They offered to slice my pickle in halves or quarters... I chose quarters and I love them for it. It's very hard to keep writing now because I just keep picking up my sandwich and eating.  It's so good!!!   They are really very friendly and freakishly fast, and accurate!"}
{"text":"Ok, without disclosing my \"mature\" age, safe to say I have been eating cheeseburgers and sub sandwiches for over 40 years.  YIKES!  I had seen some of Jimmy John's signage on buses...A little over the top but innovative.  Yesterday the work crew was unsuspectingly hoodwinked into attending a motivation seminar at the Thomas & Mack that was a mix of religious evangelism, tin salesman and how many sheep can you fit in one room.    At around 11:30am I realized that I was not buying Jesus half-off so let the boss know I was going to take a long lunch.  Since this was at the Thomas&Mack and I quickly realized that after the event collected our precious $10 for parking, those attendants were long gone by 11am and I better leave my car parked and go for a walk.  I texted the g/f for lunch ideas and she informed me there was a nearby Metro Pizza...YAY!  She always eats there so I wanted to give it a shot.  I walked to the intersection of Maryland Parkway and Trop and looked towards Smart and Final but did not recognize or see Metro.  So, I asked a hip-looking college girl for directions thinking they know all the good eateries.  She pulled out her ear-buds and quickly remarked that Metro was closed up.  What?  Turns out they weren't but my hunger precipitated a quick Plan B.  As I started to stroll north on Maryland Parkway, I noticed this JJ's tucked into a dive strip mall 200 yards from actual Parkway next to a ethnic grocery.  Seemed like a strange location for such a well-branded sub shop.  Nice layout when you walk with a large menu.  Everyone is friendly and they greet you.  I was not sure what the difference was between their \"sub\" or their \"club\" with a $1 price difference.  Turns out they are all subs but the \"clubs\" have more meat, etc.  I got some sort of ham sub on a white roll with salt/vinegar chips and drink for $8 and some change.  They have an upstairs seating area for about 20 people which is nice.  If I have eaten a gillion subs, with this economy it seems everyone is trying to get sneaky.  One way is to sell you their branded chips with about 8 chips in the bag.  JJ's chip bag was a real bag of chips.  Would I consider this a \"gourmet\" sandwich?  NO.  Was it good?  Yes.  I also respect their location.  Why pay premium rent to be right on Maryland Parkway.  SInce this is the UNLV 'hood, the percentage of pedestrians and cars might actually be 50/50.  So, if they are banking on good food at a decent price, these kids will find the place as I did."}
{"text":"What kind of sandwich place is this? If you want wheat bread it's a toast style. If you want cheese they charge you a dollar. They have no toppings or sauce. They don't even have salt and pepper. Confused at how this is a sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service depends on which one you go to.  I went to the Columbus store and as the cashier was handing me my change, our sandwiches were being slid across the counter!   We went to the address for this review.  Food..Good.  Service... Not.    We walked in around 5:30.  The place was empty.  It was just my daughter and I.  A single woman was behind us.  There were three on the line, one at cashier and two making sandwiches.  They took our order and their time on making our food.  As we sat down the lady behind us sat with a bag of chips and a soda in her hand to wait for her food.  Another lady came in and ordered as well.  As we ate, the second lady was presented her sandwich.  The first went to the counter to ask about hers and they looked surprised that they had missed it.  They missed something alright.  If you can get it, you will enjoy your meal.  I recommend you go for the multi-grain bread.  You can get a french roll anywhere."}
{"text":"They were running helter skelter yesterday with their $1 special. I grabbed one sub/sandwich at the 59th/T'Bird location. Despite enduring the 20 min. wait in a long queue I had to head to this one for a second one. The choice was either go back in line or go to another store. I decided on the latter but when I got there the queue was snaking around and longer. I'm not going to say how long but it was a lot longer than the first stop with some drama involved (all good) yet curious. Staff seemed to keep their composure despite some snags in the bread department and understandably disgruntled patrons. Surprisingly nobody threw a fit and that speaks volumes for their product (sandwiches/crew) as well as the clientele's patience/appetite. Staff was upbeat and the manager 'Melody' was really delightful and accommodating. She even handed out cold water to people in line as a nice gesture, given the circumstances. Kudos! Hope she is commended for keeping things under control as well. Well, the good thing was after that super long wait virtually everyone left with their food and a smile. Yes the sandwiches were great as usual and I'd consider making this one a regular stop in the future."}
{"text":"This is probably the slowest Jimmy Johns I've ever been to. That being said, it's still a fast drive through, it's just slower than most. I either get a Club Lulu with hot peppers or a veggie club with sprouts, but this location doesn't ever have sprouts. Am I the only one that likes it? I wish they would carry them here! The service is nice, nothing too amazing or life changing."}
{"text":"only the second time I have ordered from here and the second bad experience I have had. Ordered over 30 minutes ago. Still not here even though they are only 1 mile away. Told the driver already left and I cannot cancel the order. Unable to wait because I had to leave due to work responsibilities. Went without lunch today because of this snafu. Had to leave money with a coworker to pay for it since I could not cancel it. Hopefully it will be good tomorrow after it sits in the work fridge for a day. Incredibly fast my ass. Will not be ordering from them again"}
{"text":"I had Jimmy Johns brought to me by a dental rep today and it was missing 3 things off our order and when she called to ask them to bring them to us the Manager argued with her and insisted that everything was there... We had 8 witnesses that it wasn't and he still said it was.... I love Jimmy Johns but this location has a manager with no customer service knowledge... So which ever manager worked 7/24/13 @ lunch time needs some talking to!!"}
{"text":"On a recommendation was here for lunch Friday afternoon and WOW. I've never had such a freshly made sandwich before from a shop. I had the vegetarian (#6), which was full of different veggies (sprouts, cucumber, lettuce, tomato, etc), on a whole grain bread that definitely tasted homemade. It was filling and excellent- and in no way am I a vegetarian! I'm also NOT a fan of mayo, but I even enjoyed the mayo on this sandwich. I will definitely be coming back to try their other creations, especially now that we have the convenience of the light rail to get us to Tempe!"}
{"text":"These places are sprouting all over the valley! I am happy there is one closer, because these sandwiches are great! Last time I had the vegetarian, so this time I added some meat, with The Hunter. Roast beef and provolone on wheat. Yum! Definitely a good place to go when you're sick of Subway (and who doesn't get sick of Subway?).   My only negative is there isn't any wifi. That's really become important to me. I wanted to check in and let people know the great food I was having for lunch right then and there, rather than waiting."}
{"text":"Meh... boring, bland, unmemorable.   I always order a turkey sandwich with swiss -- What? What was that you said, no swiss? WTH -- any respectable sandwich shop SHOULD have swiss - right? Or am i totally off here. Ok, provolone will do...for now... No jalapenos? No pepperoncini's -- hmmm.... cherry peppers, ok I guess that will do for now. What?! No freaking YELLOW mustard -- WTF!!!! Now I am getting pissed at all the compromises... I'm allergic to Dijon style mustard's.... Oh wait... they have PACKETS of yellow mustard... Packets that I had to open... The bread... Meh. If was very fresh albeit, but tasteless. And don't get me started on the turkey...   Jeez for $8.79 that was the worse sandwich ever... The cherry peppers were nice, but the rest, Sorry JJ - no es bueno. I may give you another try, but highly unlikely."}
{"text":"Meh, Subway is better.  I'd rather go there and pick all the toppings I want, instead of being limited to the FEW toppings offered at Jimmy John's.  Plus, I always hear their ads advertising how fast they are, but when I went there last night my sandwich took a pretty long time to make!  At least 5 minutes.... definitely enough time for me to read that entire Dave Barry poster on the wall.  I will say that I like their bread better than Subway bread, but it's not enough to compensate for the other deficiencies."}
{"text":"Went in on Saturday for lunch.  Customer service was pretty poor.  Parking lot is not great due to ABC Store, Goodwill, and IHOP.   Biggest disappointment is their delivery area does not include the neighborhoods on the west side of Lancaster Highway.  It seems if you have a Pineville address, they do not want your business."}
{"text":"I LOVE JIMMY JOHNS, but this location has a particular group working that have no idea what customer service is. I have been going to the locations in California for years and cannot believe that when i asked to put the oil and vinegar on the side- all 6 of them working said \"no.\" They explained that it was because they \"don't have anything to put it in.\" I asked if they could put it in one of the FREE water cups and i would just carry it and they also said \"no.\" I just don't want my 10 dollar samich soggy when i get home, is that too much to ask!?"}
{"text":"Got done placing my order at 6:14pm doorbell rang at 6:24pm. Quick service! They were also friendly and the food looks great! -- now time to eat!"}
{"text":"Second time I've come here and it's just a weak sandwich I'm sorry.  Worst of all to me was the customer service, or lack there of.  Ordered on the phone, gentleman was rude as if I was interrupting his day. Arrived for this sandwich and walked up to the counter,  paid for my food.   I observed before she helped me, she was busy helping  another customer. Gave the man his food,  nicely placed in a to go bag. I get my sandwich handed to me with my cup for the combo.  No napkins, no bag, no smile, no courtesy.  Just here's your sandwich and cup like I'm just gonna walk out with these two things and chips all bundled in hand with my 6 year old.  When I asked I for a bag I not only had to repeat  myself, but got attitude with the loud unflapping of the bag like again.. ead interrupting their day.  Smh, had half the common sense to say something but stopped myself since I was with my young one.  Felt very awkward and almost prejudice. Could see it was a trainer and trainee, they looked at eachother and trainer said ' it's ok ' once again like I the customer is out of line/ interrupting their day at work. It will be the last time I go there, feel like calling speaking to manager  but it seems like that's the culture at this store. From on the phone, to the time I walked in and out just horrible experience. $13 wasted, knowledge gained."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is nice for two reasons. They are pretty quick with making your food, and they have a low-carb option for all subs. I am a fan of the low carb option, because their one of the only places I can go for lunch and feel pretty satisfied about.  You can expect to drop between 8-10 bucks for an 8\" sandwich meal. Their normal sandwiches are between $4 and $5. They have another option (between $5 and $6) for those who want a little more. If you pay for this option, expect to get double meat on, still, an 8\" roll. If I remember correctly, making it a meal - which consists of a drink and either a whole pickle, chips or a cookie, and will cost you another $3.  I go here quite frequently for lunch, and their service is consistent. But I don't think that they are 4 star quality. Ultimately I rated them a 3 because of their price in relation to the size of the sub that you get. The sandwiches, I think, are good for lunch, but if I'm looking to have a good time, I wouldn't think of Jimmy Johns.  Also, the establishment is very clean. If you judge restaurants based on plumbing and cleanliness, I'm happy to announce that their place is very good."}
{"text":"Confusing, disorganized, OVER staffed.  Mind you the bread was awesome, and even though my sandwich ended up being bare (yet I didn't order that plain one) I enjoyed the sandwich.  I won't be back, nor will my family that actually lives in the area.   The menu is a mess, and the handheld menus (so you know you don't have to look up on the board like a giraffe) have what I'm guessing is about a 9 point font.  There were 10 or so people staffed on a Sunday evening. For a store that could easily do with 5 or 6 at max.  So the bread earned them 2-stars. But watch out, they charge $.50 for wheat bread. (Lame)"}
{"text":"First timer for the famous Jimmy Johns gourmst sandwiches. I have to say the bread was good, reminds me of bolillo (mexican hoagie roll). Meat tasted like refrigeration. I ordered the country club. The one thing i have to say is they dont give you the option of toasted bread or any other veggies. I usually like other options besides lettuce, tomatoes, mayonnaise.  The reason why I gave this Jimmy Johns  2-star is because while eating, there was a \"cook\" that used his phone texting whomever he was texting, placed his phone back into his pocket. Then continued to take an unused sheet pan and put it in the dish area and then went to answer the business phone to take an order. To top it off he went straight to making sandwiches. Im sure there was a step missing  in all that he did, oh yeah he didnt wash his hands. And for whoever works in the culinary field knows that is a health code.   So maybe i wont return to the Lake Mead location, but i will definitely try another Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"Worst Jimmy John's I've been to yet.  Several issues with this location.  Subs so fast you'll freak??  Not here!  Took forever to get three basic subs with no special requests (12 minutes at least).  And they were not busy or making other sandwiches to deliver....  They are just slow.  Also, staff is rude and grumpy!  The manager doesn't know how to add, even basic math seems to elude him.  He tried to tell me that ordering a lunch box (which includes the sandwich chips and a cookie) was going to be cheaper than buying items ala carte.  When I pointed out that it was $0.50 cheaper to order ala carte he got extremely grumpy with me, saying that I was wrong and that I just didn't listen.   He had to do the math three times to understand how 10.39 ala carte is cheaper than 10.89 for the box.  He was so rude that I actually asked for him to refund the difference after we got our food, even though I really didn't care about the .50.  He was just so arrogant and argumentative.  Staff there never smiled once.  These guys are just jerks. Lastly, when our food was finally ready we didnt get everything we ordered.  I had to go back to get my chips and cookie, even though they should have been in the lunch box.  The music was so loud I couldn't hear my kid talk and there was some sketchy looking guy waiting for the manager.  Looks like they were doing something under the table if you know what I mean.  Do yourself a favor, pick a different location."}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm not a fan. Please don't hurt me!! 2 stars because the interior is cool.   I have had it twice, and both times I was not impressed. First time I got the Italian sub. To me, the bread is too overwhelming, the mayonnaise has the consistency of some certain bodily fluids, and the meat... where's the meat?   Second time I got a vegetarian sandwich (couldn't skimp out on the meat this time!!!!) So I got the same abundance of bread and mayonnaise... and no Avocado as promised! What the heck??   Maybe I am ordering the wrong thing, but I don't want to return to get the right thing."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is what it is.  Fast subs with act quality meat and ingredients.  I like the tuna and the turkey club with bacon here.  I don't know what other people are talking about.  The line moves very fast here."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, I live 1.5 miles from this location. I tried calling the store several times, but I either got put on hold or no one picked up. I decided to walk over there, turns out their delivery radius is not based on mileage, but a 5 minute travel time. What deceptive advertising, no wonder you can be \"freaky fast\" when you only travel 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Same issue I have with the other location, the staff sick, rude and not helpful. Likewise, I hate their deceptive marketing, the reason they are\"freaky fast\", is because they only delivery within a 5 minute radius, apparently I am in a Jimmy Johns dead zone, sandwiched (ha ha) between two stores that will not deliver to me."}
{"text":"I have had Jimmy John's a couple of times, and it's surprisingly decent.  The sub options are good and easy to customize.  The bread looks like it would taste bad(or just be average), but it is actually one of the highlights of Jimmy John's.   The Unwich (lettuce wrap) is also very good if the lettuce is fresh (batting .500 in this dept.).  Overall, good food and fast service."}
{"text":"Okay. I love Jimmy Johns. I eat here more often than I'm willing to admit because it's decently priced and really close to my work. Had I completed this review before yesterday, I would have given them 5 stars. BUT... after my experience yesterday, they lose a star. Here's what happened: I ordered my sub: dry (no sauce), no tomato, and no lettuce. The delivery guy took FOREVER to get to us, probably about 20-30 minutes (normally the delivery really is freaky fast), and my drink was all gross and watered down. My sandwich was also wrong, with all the sauce possible and just a ridiculous amount of lettuce. I called the restaurant, and the guy was a little rude, and said \"Well on your receipt it doesn't say anything about needing the sandwich dry.\" I replied with, \"That may be the case, but I asked for it to be...\" He kind of sighed and said \"Okay, I'll send a new sandwich, but make sure you give the old one to the driver.\" Which was fine, whatever. I was more ticked off that the guy was rude to me for asking them to correct their mistake.  In all probability, I will order from them again. I was just a tad put off with my experience yesterday."}
{"text":"Hands down the Best subs i have ever had, got a #9 italian, next day i went to subway got an italian, and i couldnt even finish, after eatin at jimmy johns, subways food tasted like cardboard.."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty avid JJs patron and this location is pretty standard with one exception. There have been issues with my order all three times I've ordered. Left off bacon on a delivery I placed via the JJ's app (was still charged though), left off onions another time, and today they just didn't add the sprouts I requested when I was the only customer in the shop. Not major issues, but the lack of basic attention to detail makes me wonder what else could be slipping through the cracks behind the scenes. At the he end of the day, the food still tastes good so three stars seems fair."}
{"text":"People standing around but can't make a sandwich. then you order a number and they have it half made with mayo by the time you say...\"no Mayo\"   Really have to watch and check what they make. Better quality than Subway but they just don't know how to provide customer service."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy John's and I respect that they have teens running the store. But sometimes that makes the service worse.   I travel and pick up sandwhichs on the way to the airport. So I will try again and hope to give a higher score"}
{"text":"Hey! Do you love bread?? You: Why yes I do!! Do you love really stale, tasteless bread? You: Love it! Wait, do you like eating plain, bland sandwiches and cold, soggy hardly cooked bacon with just a drop of mustard so that you can't even taste it and it just seems like you're eating a dry slab of meat and bread? You: Oh my gosh, YES! That's my favorite, pile that sh*t on! Ok last question, 2 really bad cafeteria quality sandwiches and the delivery driver will forget part of your order and have to come back, around $25.00 seem fair?? You: Totally!   Ok then, Jimmy John's has you covered!!   Oh. And by the way. If you ever deliver me food again and don't bring me NAPKINS, I will have your soul!!!   I'm out. (Drops mic)"}
{"text":"My go-to sandwich so far has been their deluxe Italian combo that's got a ton of different Italian meats.   I am not a huge fan of the bread.   But I am a HUGE fan of their oatmeal cookies. I like my cookies crispy and not chewy at all, but this place is an exception for me. The chocolate chip cookie is good, and the oatmeal is quite legit.   Service is great, delivery is awesome, and their chips are actually an original and doesn't taste like the other brands in a good way.   NOOOOOOOIIIIIIIIIICEE!"}
{"text":"First time trying jimmy johns. I'm usually a capriottis guy but I didn't feel like spending my entire break there so I decided on jimmy johns. I got the #9 and it was pretty good. Nice portion size and great quality ingredients. The sandwich was assembled very well and extremely fast. As soon as I finished paying at the counter my sandwich was ready. Great customer service as well. The guy at the counter was very helpful after I told him that it was my first time. He made a great recommendation with the #9. Overall I'm very satisfied with my visit and will be returning. The reason I'm rating 4/5 and not 5/5 is because I wish jimmy johns gave the option to toast their sandwiches that would be awesome!"}
{"text":"Dreadful Service  I've had Jimmy John's before several years ago in Minneapolis.. But apparently here in Phoenix, the store personnel must be trained differently. I had to take my sandwich back up to the counter twice to get the thick headed folks working at the one on Camelback at about 16th to get my sandwich the way I wanted it.  I asked for a #10 Hunter's Club with all the veggies. What I got was the standard #10 Hunters Club with lettuce and tomatoes.   After seeing that, I took it back up to the counter, and explained that I wanted all the veggies. They explained to me that those were all the veggies the sandwich came with. I carefully explained that I wanted all of the veggies that they have. The guy said, oh, you want the Freebies. I would have thought he would have clarified when I ordered whether I just wanted everything that came on the sandwich, or the Freebies as well. I said yes, I wanted all of the Freebie Veggies.   I took my revised sandwich and sat down to eat it, only to find that along with the veggies I had requested, they had piled on Italian vinaigrette and Dijon mustard, which I did NOT want."}
{"text":"The sandwich is good but their claim is the delivery service and how fast it is when in fact, they don't deliver at all."}
{"text":"Done with these guys. Sad because I like their food and used to order 2-3 times a week. The driver rarely reads the ticket with instructions to the building. An hour late on a couple occasions with just a sorry and the tip was paid in advance.   Somebody else can earn my patronage."}
{"text":"All tables were dirty. Sandwiches were terrible when I asked for avocado should have made sure it wasn't a spread thought it was sliced. Just disappointed all around"}
{"text":"We've ordered from here several times. I don't know that they've ever gotten our order completely correct, but tonight was ridiculous. They brought my daughter the completely wrong sandwich (turkey instead of tuna), my unwich was less than half the size it usually is, and my husband's sub was missing some of its meat. We ordered through the app, so there couldn't have been any miscommunication. I think we might be done with Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this Jimmy John's location for over 6 years. I love Jimmy Johns and the fact that this location delivers to my place of employment has been the greatest thing about my lunch experiences at work. I have ordered successfully and haven't had a single issue with an order or delivery at any time during the 6 years.  A few weeks ago, I was hoping to surprise an amazing coworker with a Jimmy Johns lunch on me! I told her not to bring a lunch from home since we were going to enjoy sandwiches from our favorite place. I placed my order online, as I have done a gazillion times, and received a confirmation that the order would arrive by 11:45 am. When I went to the main office to pick up the order (again I've done that plenty of times) I realized my order was missing, however, another order was sitting there just waiting to be claimed. The office informed me that the person who had ordered the unclaimed meal, had canceled the order due to timing issues but the order was still delivered. I thought \"JJ's must have mixed up our orders and cancelled the wrong order. No big deal, mistakes happen, right?!\" Assuming this mistake was no fault of my own, and a simple, non-intentonal mistake by Jimmy Johns, I figured I would call, inform them politely about by concerns, and the situation would be rectified quickly and I would still be able to provide my amazing coworker with a much deserved Jimmy Johns lunch. Unfortunately, I was transferred to multiple employees and after explaining the situation multiple times, kindly, I was connected with someone named \"Gabby\". When I explained the situation, Gabby immediately became defensive, accepted zero responsibility, and even went as low as to tell me someone called and cancelled my order. When I told her that was virtually impossible, she reassured me the person who called to cancel the order, repeated my order \"verbatim\" and therefore, they cancelled the order. Gabby- insisted she was right and acted as if what I thought happened, and did happen, was completely wrong. All I could think about was the fact she still hadn't said one thing about trying to fix the situation!!! I still wanted my Jimmy Johns!!  I have never met someone like Gabby who works in an industry to meet the needs of customers, treat a one with such disrespect and disregard! Anyway, the order sitting in the office, unclaimed, was the order they were suppose to cancel...obviously...not mine, which by the way, could never have been repeated \"verbatim\" since it was a totally different sandwich order. Throughout my incredible effort to explain the fact that no one called to called MY order...completely impossible...Gabby NEVER once took the time to explore the situation further or even attempt to understand what actually occurred. Instead of accepting responsibility for canceling the wrong order, which I would have graciously understood, her response was to insist I had called, recited the order \"verbatim\" and asked for it to be cancelled. So, there I sat...no lunch...starving, no lunch for my coworker, who I insisted not bring lunch from home that day because it was my treat to provide her with an amazing lunch from Jimmy Johns ?, feeling disrespected, unheard, and completely unvalued as a dedicated customer. I ended up informing Gabby that even after years and years of excellent customer service from this Jimmy Johns location, she- in one outrageous display of the inability to accept a mistake, that could have been easy rectified- chose to approach me as a dumb customer who called to cancel my own lunch order that my coworker and I had been looking forward to all week long. As if that wasn't bad enough...I had to contact my coworkers who ACTUALLY cancel their completely different order-which never actually got cancelled- that they would have to put in the effort to get the Jimmy Johns order removed for their credit card since they had been charged for the same order they respectfully cancelled appropriately. I am not a YELP reviewer and it has taken me weeks to write this, but this situation was one I could not let go unnoticed. No person, such as Gabby, should be handling situations such as this- especially when dealing with dedicated, satisfied, understanding, and forgiving customers.  A simple, \"Oh, man. That was our mistake. Let me fix that for you.\" would have turned an already awesome customer into an even happier one.  Instead, the opposite occurred because of the blatent disrespected towards a customer who just wanted to check up on her lunch order that hadn't arrived on time. I will never, nor will my affected coworkers, ever place an order with this Jimmy Johns location. My suggestion would be that Gabby never again be the default person to handle such situations. It's sad that a situation that could have been an opportunity to display great customer service, this was the outcome."}
{"text":"I am so happy that a Jimmy John's finally made it to the Robinson area. Couldn't be happier with it. Incredibly fast service (seriously...in and out in an average of 2 minutes!) and the subs are always fresh and have a decent amount of toppings. Employees are always super friendly as well."}
{"text":"Solid sub, a pleasant departure from the typical monotony served by other establishments (I'm looking at you, Subway). My sandwich made strong, simple statements, not over-exerting  itself on any individual category. More specifically, the bread was plain yet satisfyingly fluffy and tasteful. With regards to the menu, the suggestions were spot-on, in the case that creating your own sandwich has gotten too demanding. For those of you with plainer tastes, you'll be happy to know that you can purchase a sub without the usual veggies and sauces for a reduced price."}
{"text":"Delivery is freaky fast-----lettuce wraps also freakin good! Try them!! Less carbs and healthier for you! I recommend trying them!"}
{"text":"Staff was rude. Tables had not been wiped down/cleaned for hours. No napkins or condiments in reach--had to ask for them twice because initially a rude employee completely ignored my request. Food was good though."}
{"text":"Reckless driving by a Jimmy John's employee.  This afternoon I was almost driven off the road by a Jimmy John's employee. I'm assuming they delivered from this location because it is the one closest to my home. As I was driving through my neighborhood one of their drivers (licence plate BYC2960) swerved around me on a two lane street going at least 60 trying not to miss a light at Gilbert and Hampton. Smooth move, dork . I hope it was worth it, considering you were stopped at the same light I was a few seconds after that. This type of behavior is unacceptable and it looks poorly upon your company to employ someone who drives this reckless. I understand your slogan but what happened today was ridiculous. I'm not planning to go to Jimmy John's in the near future and I do intend to share this situation with friends so that they'll think twice about it too."}
{"text":"My friend just picked up Jimmy John's for us I am eating it now it is so good I love the Brad I got the BLT I know that sounds basic but the sandwiches just so good. I'm full but I want more. Pickles."}
{"text":"Freaky fast my A#@! Wouldn't deliver literally 1.5 miles away. Said that would be going out of there way. Nice. I just saw a jimmy john car drive by."}
{"text":"Typical Jimmy Johns.  Great subs. Fast friendly service."}
{"text":"The bread, oh the bread! I was boring and grabbed a turkey sandwich. It was exactly what I wanted though! That shredded lettuce and perfect amount of meat, no cheese. The crunchy kettle chips are a great pair and its fun to read the signs on the walls as you wait for your order. I dig this place!"}
{"text":"My taste buds were creaming all over the place once I stuck this delicious stuffed wad of lettuce in my mouth to enjoy. I tried the Beach Club Unwich and it was full of turkey, provolone cheese, mayo, sprouts, tomato and cucumber. Mmmmmm yum yes the lettuce was ultra fresh and crispy.  I never thought I would enjoy a sub wrapped in lettuce so much as I did. I was at work moaning and groaning it was just so tasty. I am hooked and I yearn for the chance to enjoy it again and again over and over.  Oh Jimmy John's what have you done to me, I dream of you, I want you, I need you, fill me up!"}
{"text":"Disgusted. Stopped in for lunch with my mom and my daughter, who has Muscular Dystrophy and is in a wheelchair. We probably would have spent $20. My daughter was thirsty so we asked for a cup of water but needed one with a lid so she didn't spill it. They wanted to charge us .29 for the cup! We told them that it was for my daughter, explaining why we needed a lid. The response was \"sorry that's our policy\" so we went next door to Rubios, who had no concern with grasping the concept of why we needed a lid.   Over a stupid cup."}
{"text":"I visited the 14900 N. Pima Rd. location (first time trying a JJ location) and was rushed to order by the woman at the counter. No one was in the store but she kept rushing me. Why? I do not know. Turkey sandwich on white roll (was not given an option) was dry.  The only option given to me was mayo. When I asked for oil / vinegar, I was told they did not have any.  $1.50 for pickle - that is a whole jar."}
{"text":"What the?! My sandwich is already ready!? But I haven't even ordered! Yea they're that fast. I thought the Deli owned by Jason was good, but they're not even in the same league as Jimmy.    I'm usually very particular about what goes in my sandwich, but when it comes to Jimmy, I take it his way. So the options might be a tad limited, they might not have soup (at least I don't think they do) but boy do they make a mean sandwich.  The quality of the products says it all. No fillers, no fancy sauces, just meat, mayo and the traditional veggies. Chips are amazing, and the best part about their sandwiches is that great french bread. Holds everything together nicely, doesn't get mushy and has a great firmness and chewiness. Yum yum yum."}
{"text":"The messed up my order- I wanted one #4 wrap (no sprouts +sauce) and one #4 on wheat for my dad... they didn't put his on wheat and when I asked them to change it they didn't apologize and told me it would be $.53 more.  They also forgot my sauce. Usually I'm a fan of Jimmy John's and will go to the University location from now on (even though neither of them deliver to my house!)"}
{"text":"Twice in the last 4 trips to JJs we got home and the sub didn't have the toppings we asked for. Second time it happened we called to complain and they insisted it was our fault. They told us we could drive it back and they would give us a new one. No thanks, won't ever be driving back there."}
{"text":"Fast they are!!  I just wish their sandwiches had more flavor!  Something!  Anything!  I had the roast beef sandwich.  It was good but it needed some flavor.  Chipotle mayo maybe!  I'm going to have to look into this next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Writing this review is both good and bad. I hate the owner and the moronic behavior but damn the subs are good. Delivery was on time and was a very nice man."}
{"text":"This place is such a wonderful part of my life that I created a Yelp account just so I could give it a five-star review.   \"Subs so fast you'll freak\" is important, especially at 2am when the bars start playing \"Closing Time\" and the college kids all stumble at once over to JJs. I often do freak due to the sheer speed of my sandwich creation.   The food is absolutely delicious. I'm sure it's just a matter of taste, but to me, it's not even a contest with whatever is being slapped on some rolls across the street. The bread is fantastic; the guts of the sandwiches are perfect. Whoever devised the recipes for these simple sandwiches (I assume Mr. Jimmy John himself) deserves an award.   JJ's website is also pretty sweet. As a socially awkward Case grad, I prefer to do my business with a computer, rather than have to speak to a human on the phone, and their website is so complete that every option or request I might have had on the phone is covered.   Best of all, however, are the people that work at Jimmy John's on Coventry. I love them. As a frequent flyer there for the past couple of years, most of them know my name and several of them know the few sandwiches I always choose between. They have always been friendly to me, drunk or sober, and have been introduced to my friends, stood up for me when crazy people were giving me a hard time, and have taught me the ways of the JJs. They are all-around great people.  I recently moved out of the delivery zone of JJs and couldn't be sadder about my loss of easy access to Jimmy John's. Whoever is in charge of delivery zones, if you're reading this, PLEASE expand a few blocks! My business would be worth it!"}
{"text":"Ode # 12  I go to chain and non-chain sandwich spots and always come back to Jimmy John's turkey club sandwich #12.  I start working out and promise no carbs and one day I'm found cheating with JJ bread and #12..  I like to try Japanese, Argentinian and other fancy and non-fancy steakhouses for only meat and vegetables and ultimately end up at some JJ ordering #12...  After a game or a movie, when not feeling like committing a greasy carb crime on pizzas, your good alternative is #12....  I've had bad experiences at some locations of Jimmy John's and still go back to #12.....  They sadly stopped serving sprouts and I was very pissed about it, and I still get #12......  Some good friends judgmentally hate and reject Jimmy John's. It's either you hate it or love it. No option C here...I have no other choice but to stay faithful to #12........   I don't like processed or injected food but I have no idea why I keep going back to #12............  This location is cool, by the way."}
{"text":"In the US there are two kinds of people, Jimmy John's (JJ) lovers, and JJ haters. I haven't met anyone who's in between! If you happen to be a JJ hater, no worries; you're just luckily born not to be a bread person. There is no way that you love bread and you don't like JJ bread. It will not make any sense, I reckon. JJ freshly baked French bread is one of my favorite carbs treats.   After having another classic blessed Sunday (finishing laptop work and coffee) with one of my best buddies, we decided to reward ourselves by going to the movies at the beautiful Waterfront shopping complex. I love going there because parking is no issue; Waterfront Homestead is super clean and has lovely views while crossing Homestead bridge. Also there is always a good smoky smell of some burgers in process from Burgatory or Bar Louie or others. Having a good meal after a movie is one of my bad-good habits that I enjoy with my good ol' buddies. In the west, my post-movies rituals were devouring some In-N-Out burgers animal style. Anyways, we stumbled across Jimmy John's by accident while loafing around after the movie. My friend never had JJ in his entire life; I was praying he's born to be a Jimmy John's lover. Fortunately he loved his Beach Club sandwich ( the turkey one). He was on the same page with the bread being so awesome here. The unfortunate part is they don't have alfaalfa sprouts here neither. But that's OK.   Bread quality: 4.5 stars, awesome! Sandwich (#12 Beach Club): 4 stars.  Atmosphere: classic JJ, a little small: 3.5 stars.  Service and staff: they are ok."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped here for lunch here today.  The space was clean and the sandwiches were consistent with the kind of solid deli fare that I've come to expect from Jimmy Johns since my undergrad days.  However, the assaultingly loud music that was playing in the store made me think twice about ever returning.  While the level might not have seemed as bad for the employees at the counter, the dining space is cavernous, and my mom and I were straining just to have a simple conversation, even though we were the only diners at the time.  I finally asked a staff member to lower the volume, and only a negligible adjustment was made.  I shouldn't have to make that kind of request twice.  My mom wears hearing aids and already struggles to hear in public settings, even where the sound is more moderate.  This situation needlessly soured our meal.  Not OK, Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"This location is awful on delivery.  Have tried them twice.  First time took an hour (I am 9 blocks away).  Second time the driver had car problems and they did not even notify me.  They were planning on delivering my order AFTER the original driver's car was fixed??  The manager ended up crediting my card for the order, but this store needs a lot of work"}
{"text":"Once again, terrible. Order showed up missing a sandwich. Better though than the last time when we actually drove over and had to stand there for ten minutes while their guy gave us a lecture on politics. Seriously dude, we all feel the Bern, but I just got off work, I've got an hour commute ahead of me, and all I want is my freaking sandwich! You know, the one you are supposed to be making me right now with the bread you are waving around."}
{"text":"This location is off of 54th St. in Chandler Arizona. Superclean location and friendly attentive staff. It's very busy at lunch but they make sandwiches so fast it doesn't matter if there's a line.   I love the Lulu or Vito is my favorites.  They have delivery and it's freaky fast."}
{"text":"This Jimmy John's staff knows what customer service is all about! Jessica helped me multiple days for large catering orders last minute. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Freaky fast! Ok so I enjoy Jimmy John's the food is good and a great quality. As far as sandwiches go you can find cheaper but the fresh ingredients here are worth the cost. It's all about the bread and if you go in grab a 50 cent day old loaf for the road. With that bread as your sandwich canvas you cannot go wrong in your own sandwich creations."}
{"text":"I just ordered lunch for me and my husband and both of our orders were incorrect. Not sure why you have the options to customize your sandwich and pay extra when they don't accommodate the request. Maybe instead of being freaky fast you can be freaky efficient."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch on our way to a baseball tourney.   The staff was very friendly and the location was super clean.  Sandwiches were made to order and were done promptly-even before we could sit down.  Portions were large!  I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good simple cheap subs, reminds me of the ones back home in mom and pop shops. small menue but it works for them, good for a cheap meal :)"}
{"text":"Always been a Jimmy Johns fan. Ordered tonight and there is a storm. They called to tell us they were running a bit slower than \"freaky fast\" and offered us free beverages. Very cool! So great to work with a company that cares about their customers and customer satisfaction. Fan of jimmy johns already but that was super legit."}
{"text":"I've eaten from this location and others a few times and this sandwich reminds me of why it's been such a long time since I've eaten here. The only bread option is white and there's only provolone cheese. The only flavour on my sandwich (Vito) came from the hot peppers. The steps they take to deliver are above and beyond, but this doesn't make-up for the lack of taste."}
{"text":"The only freaking I've ever done over the speed of my sandwhich delivery from this location is that it takes so freaking long.  I can't believe people like this have demanded and received a $10 an hour minimum wage here in Arizona."}
{"text":"Only getting one star because it would let me put ZERO. Thanks Jimmy Johns for delivering a piece of meat between two slices of bread instead of a #4 turkey tom. I could see evidence in the wrapping that someone attempted to put lettuce on my sandwich but then changed their mind. I am now stuck at work with nothing to eat for lunch. I sure appreciate it!"}
{"text":"Okay.  I have to rank this location low.  We ordered from this location for lunch today and I was looking forward to getting my #5 Vito on white.  We got our orders, they made a mistake on one of the orders (gave the wrong sandwich) and on my #5, it had tuna salad on it.  It was a little bit, but it made the sandwich smell like tuna.  The #5 is an Italian Sub so it was ruined.  It was also soaking with oil and vinegar.  We were very disappointed.  We miss our Charleston location."}
{"text":"This place is officially dead to me...DEAD TO ME, I TELLS YA!!!  I've given them a few chances now, but after today...DONE!  I went in, and there of course was a long line (hello...lunchtime!).  I get that.  I go to the counter, order, try to pay and, according to them, my credit card is declined...I try two more...DECLINED!...okay, weird, but it's getting a bit mortifying at this point and the line is getting longer.  So, I pay with cash. Move on...I get my order (a Slim sammy which does not include anything except meat and/or cheese - that's it!), bring it back to work...there's lettuce, tomato and onion on it...um...exsqueeze me?...oh and by the by, each and everyone of my cards has available funds on it, so what the french...  I guess if I want a sammy from now on, Duck and Decanter, here I come!"}
{"text":"\"The #4.. ( turkey tom ) very simple turkey and cucumber and mayo.. need to try #12 ( beach club ) now that's a sandwich.\""}
{"text":"I've been ordering delivery from Jimmy John's for at least 2 years now, because, frankly, it's the only place that isn't pizza that will deliver to my location. I work at a local school, and had easily been able to order online, until just recently-it turns out our business is not good enough for them-they actually blocked our server from ordering from them. (I can't order off of our school server, but when I put my hotspot on, or order off of my phone, I can. We all found this very interesting.) Needless to say, it's always been: \"if anyone else would deliver, we would order from them instead,\" because Jimmy John's delivery is subpar at best, and their sandwiches are comparable to any other place around. They manage to deliver an incorrect order 3 out of 4 times; they rarely provide napkins, and hardly ever include the extras, like mayo when you ask for it. When you call to tell them they've screwed up the order (as usual), they tell you to stop eating, because they will be collecting the mis-made sandwich as proof they messed up. Sorry, when you order cheese and bread, and they deliver cheese, bread, and avocado, it's pretty clear that they have no clue what they are doing. On top of that, they charge a RIDICULOUS delivery fee, on top of tip. (1.75 for 1 sandwich, and 2.99 for 2 or 50 sandwiches.) They make more money on delivery than they do on the sandwich, (which, as previously stated, is very rarely correct). Needless to say, after being a total sucker, and spending $300 in a YEAR ordering from this terrible, terrible business, I WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN. Jimmy John's-you've always sucked, but I'd rather eat a frozen meal than spend another penny on the likes of you. (p.s. I will be forwarding this review to my fellow colleagues, and will offer to GO PICK UP their order from ANY OTHER PLACE all year next year. Thanks for nothing.)"}
{"text":"Kuddos  to the staff here today for Customer Appreciation Day. The line was long, but unbelievably fast. Such a large courteous staff. Your manager should be proud of all you kids. Great job!"}
{"text":"If you have to grab some food in a hurry, this is indeed your place. The commercials are true. This place indeed makes great sandwiches super fast. What was more impressive is that the guys at this location were really cool. Mad props to the guy who hired these dudes."}
{"text":"Well first time coming in and they were so rude and disrespectful it made me sick to my stomach then watched the girl sweet talk people after us and I couldn't ask for oil n vinegar was told I can't help you my job is more important than your sandwich request wow so rude"}
{"text":"Ive never been inside the restaurant.  Never ordered anything from this location.  They get 5 stars from me simply for giving out free subs to people that were sitting in traffic last night.  I will now make sure to come back here and order.  Thanks for the free food while I was in traffic!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwiches, amazing bread.  I always have them leave the bread in, instead of hollowing it out on my sandwich.  It's that good.  Sometimes someone at this particular restaurant is a little heavy-handed on the onions, so now when I order, I always as for light onions.  Agree with another reviewer who was confused about their delivery area.  I'm about a mile away, and it takes me 2 minutes to get there (3 if I get stuck at the light at Eastern).  We had an event at our office, and I'd just assumed they would deliver here, so I sent our attendees a link to their website so they could let me know what to order.  When I placed the order, I found out they didn't deliver here.  When I went to pick it up, I timed it in the car....it was 2 minutes 43 seconds to get there.  Very confused about their delivery area.  I do enjoy their sandwiches though, and this will be added to my lunch options for sure."}
{"text":"It's a Jimmy Johns. Sandwich was done before I could even finish filling my medium soda at the fountain.  Freaky Fast..."}
{"text":"I'm a big Fan of Jimmy John's. However I ordered three sandwiches with two kids and they wanted to split both. The only different ingredient they wanted on half of one of the sandwiches was a smear of mayonnaise on half and dry on the other. And easy enough request however I was told it is \"corporate policy\" And they couldn't Fulfill this simple request. Not sure why they could not cater to me and my twins. But I agreed to have the sandwich dry and take mayonnaise packets with us. So I asked for a plastic knife so they could spread the mayonnaise on the one side and then I was told they don't even have any Utensils. I'm kind of annoyed they didn't tell me about the utensil situation until after we had the sandwiches paid for wrapped up and going out the door.  Combine this with the Crazy story about not being able to get alfalfa sprouts back in the restaurant. I really do wonder what their training videos are all about."}
{"text":"So happy they opened up here! Great taste& quick...my hungry soccer girls love this place. Only problem is the crew is rowdier than every other jimmy johns I ever patronized before so that's why I am not giving it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Shouldn't take 15 minutes to get a sub here when no one else is in line at the store. Employees were unfamiliar with how to make the sandwiches."}
{"text":"did I eat at the same place all of you other reviewers ate?   nothing fantastic about it - just a sandwhich.  I can make better.   this really is along the lines of subway or blimpie - the only thing that is better than those 2 is that the  service was fast and good."}
{"text":"My husband brought it home one day and it was so good! Can't remember the name of the sandwich but it was on wheat bread, roast beef and turkey. They give you plenty too. Try it, its good!"}
{"text":"Good food and plenty of it! Ordered over the phone and picked up. No issues at all. Beach Club on wheat with sprouts is goood!"}
{"text":"Wow, I was surprised at how much I liked this place and the veggie sandwich we had. Fresh yummy bread, very good tasting sandwich, just the right size, very fast service and CHEAP for what you get. The sandwich was enough to fill me up and it was only $4.25. You can't beat that! Much better than subway. I'm a new fan, it's across from where I work and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This staff is wonderful! Everyone is friendly and fast. Of course the food is good. The staff makes the experience great though. High quality all around! It's not a fluke, it's consistent. Well done and thank you!"}
{"text":"I did an online order so it would be in my office \"freaky fast\" it has been well over 20 minutes, I had to be that girl that calls in to ask about her lunch? I could have walked across the street because I can see their place out the window but due to working I couldn't do the simple walk over, and now here I am on lunch with no food. So if you want to get food ordered expect a wait. I am so disappointed don't say freaky fast, don't lie to me."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this JJ a 3 star just because of their efficiency and ability for me to get a sandwich in a decent amount of time so I can thoroughly enjoy my full lunch hour.  Tucked into the building on 3rd St... this location can be hard to spot.  It is also tight inside, just grab your sandwich and go to wherever you are going to eat it - back to the office or what-have-you.  I decided to stroll over to RB Park to take advantage of the day and get some vitamin D.  Since this location is so small, you will always feel like you are in the way for the minute or so you are waiting for your sandwich to be created.  Cashier's are friendly, but make sure you know what you want in advance, there is barely enough room inside to fumble around and wait behind a guy looking at the menu!"}
{"text":"OH Jimmy John's...you are a godsend when one forgets his lunch at home and you need a quick, tasty, filling lunch that will help you with the next half of your workday and not put you down for the count at 2pm.  This location is tucked away across from UNCC and is fairly busy.  I like how the seating area is bigger than the location on Mallard Creek Rd/Prosperity Creek.  It is also less noisy.... Usually the other location kinda yells at you when you come in.  It becomes endearing (eventually).  This one is more subdued:  \"Hey, how's it going\" and doesn't really do anything to my blood pressure quite like the other location.  The sandwiches are made with the same speed and efficiency... so I am pretty much using the entire lunch hour devoted to stuffing my face and not necessarily waiting on food to be prepared."}
{"text":"A colleague was talking about Jimmy Johns on Friday and had stated that they make a great Cheesesteak.  So my ears perked and I went out on a quest today to find a Jimmy Johns.  First off, the map on their website is off.  It had the location in the Sharon Corners shopping center but the store is not there, it's across Sharon Rd next to FedEx Office (formerly Kinkos) and next to the new Whole Foods store.  So as I enter the store, I realize this is a very tiny location for take out only.  Everyone is crammed at the door looking at the menu trying to decide.  No real organization to a line either.  I browse the menu and there are no cheesesteaks.  Maybe my colleague had the wrong sub chain in mind.  Ok so I go with the #5 Vito (An Italian Sub).    When I got home, I looked at the sandwich and felt cheated.  The sandwich was all bread.  So I opened up the sandwich to take a closer look.  3 small slices of tomato (see photo), meat slices so thin it was just barely passing for a slice rather than shaved and tons of lettuce.  It was even lacking in oil and vinegar.   I guess for the price, I shouldn't expect much.  The prices are reasonable.  But if you're looking for a little substance to your sandwich, there are better sub places out there like Lenny's and Jersey Mikes.   And they don't sell cheesesteaks....Bummer."}
{"text":"It was my first time there. The cashier didn't explain anything. I was asking lots of questions, and he just told me to pick. So, I did. He then took my payment. I asked how it worked. He's like it will be done at the end of the counter. It would have been more helpful to explain sooner that I needed to specify everything right then and there. I was frustrated and asked for my money back.   Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been fortunate to work next to a Jimmy Johns most of my working career.  There is something about the bread that makes the sandwiches absolutely delicious.  I always feel that the ingredients are much more fresh than Subway.  My favorite sub is the Italian night club, with hot peppers.  Overall, great sandwiches! Definitely a go to restaurant during lunch time!"}
{"text":"JJ's is just always so dang fast and they never a mistake. The location of this one is especially nice since you can grab some coffee from Biggby's next door. Bonus!"}
{"text":"I used to order Jimmy John's all the time and every time it was delivered. I love the food. A new location opened up 2.2 miles away from my home and they do not deliver. What kind of place does not deliver 2 miles out!?!?  So I took a short 5 minute ride to get food for my family and when we first walked in, the place was empty and 5 employees were there. In my opinion, you could do with less people or maybe widen your delivery area and have the extra employees drive, instead of doing nothing. My daughter and myself were greeted by three girls with stone faces who acted like it was the worst thing in the world to have customers. The entire time we were ordering this is how they acted, I could not tell you if they even had teeth. WORST customer service ever.  When they were done they put the food on the counter and walked away. I asked if they could put my food in a bag and they told me the bags were behind the counter and I could bag my own food. If this is the custom, cool, but let people know that and put the bags and napkins where the customers can actually see the items.  The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because the food is really good. Whoever owns this place needs to work on employee's customer service skills and widen the delivery bubble. You will make more money if you improve both."}
{"text":"I work down the street. Less than 2miles but they refuse to deliver to my work because it goes under a highway overpass. Since they wouldn't deliver to me I placed a pick up order. I got there 15mins after I placed my order and no there was no one in the store and they didn't have my sub ready. Worst jimmy johns I've went to. Not to mention my bread felt stale was really dry and hard."}
{"text":"This is a family favorite sandwich shop and we love the service and delivery is speedy."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if I could. This place is empty, and I can see why!!!  Three employees & 1 customer (me) & they make me walk to the end of the restaurant to pick up a napkin?!?!  messed up my order, too. Subway is SO NICE compared to this & the prices are better. The roast beef was good, but not wort the hassle!!!  Never again!!! AND they have NO WIFI. - unlike every other jjs I have ever been to.   Franchise owner - you need to get a manager in there. Maybe the employee at the register would unglue herself from her phone!!!"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is great for a quick meal. I stopped in here while I was out running errands one day. This location is tucked in the strip in the corner. This particular location when I stopped in seems a little less \"friendly\" than other locations that I have visited. Isn't that part of their whole corporate deal? Greet you when you walk in and leave. Also, while I was here two of the workers were doing what seemed like working on the schedule in a booth. Don't you have an office space in the back to do that? It just doesn't seem professional to be doing it in the front of the store."}
{"text":"This Jimmy John location is newer. When they built it, they built it with a drive-thru which is always awesome! The drive-thru is super fast, just like when you order in the store. The food is always fresh and delicious. I love their bread.   I went with one of my favorites today, #12 the beach club. The avocado spread is great! I always order it without mayo because I think the avocado spread is enough. Always have to get a bag of salt and vinegar chips to go with it. All of their chips are kettle chips!   However, the girl working the drive-thru today was talking so fast and kind of cut me off to repeat back what I had just said before I was even finished talking. I get the whole \"speed\" motto but it was a little overkill."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is great! This is my favorite sub place! The bread is perfection. My two favorite subs are the Italian Night Club (be sure to add hot peppers!) and the Beach Club! When I order the Beach Club I usually order it without mayo because it doesn't really need it with the avocado spread!   All of the chips that they sell in the store are kettle cooked which are my favorite.I always go salt and vinegar but have also enjoyed the jalapeno flavor from time to time. They also have big deli style pickles. I don't like the pickles that much here, I feel like they aren't pickled/vinegary enough. The cookies aren't that good either, I would skip those! Jimmy John if you're reading this... go take a course in cookies from Subway!!! Please!!! Or can your delivery guys stop at Subway and pick some cookies up for me? I digress...   When they say speedy delivery, they really mean speedy! This place is about 5 mins from my house and they've rang my doorbell 10 minutes after hitting the submit order button! Also, the staff is always really friendly when they deliver and in the store."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is great! This is my favorite sub place! Their subs are the perfect size for me! More than a six inch, less than a foot (insert dirty joke here!).

When I order the Beach Club I usually order it without mayo because it doesn't really need it with the avocado spread!

{"text":"Never had anything bad here, friendly staff and always fresh food. They are tops for me when I want a quick sandwich"}
{"text":"\"Welcome to the Best part of your Day.\"  That's what the cashier said to me when I walked in. I gave him a half smile as I really thought about what he said and then placed my order.   Ordered a #9 and #10 combos, a good solid Italian and roast beef sandwich respectively.  Service speed hasn't changed much. It is still as fast and speedy as ever. My sandwich's are always done before I can even fill up both of my drinks.   I bag up the sandwiches, chips and put my drinks in the carrier and walk out. As I started to open the door, the same cashier told me to \"Have a great day\" and gave me a smile.   I really started to think about what he said when I first walked in there. \"Welcome to the best part of your day.\"  He didn't know I was having a crappy day. That I was at work since 4:30 in the morning, finally getting a break from work at 1 pm even if it was just to drive a pick my president up a sandwich. He didn't know that I was stuck in a 4 hour meeting today. Nor did he know the handful of new policies I had to write and implement once I got back to work.  I drove back to work thinking, that man was ALMOST right. The best part of my day is always coming home to my hunny and son but other than that, it was a good part of my day.   I am not trying to be too personal but I just need to relate a little and make you feel how important customer service truly is (at least to me). As stated in my previous review about Jimmy Johns, they have a good solid sub. Love their pickles and cookies even more. You can't go wrong with their food.   However, this location had lacked in the customer service department. And in a business where customer service is YOUR business, it is a very important detail. And during my last couple of visits, the service has been better but not great but after today, I just had to do an update and upgrade them to a 4.  Thank you Jimmy Johns for giving me one part of the best part of my day!"}
{"text":"Need short notice catering? Yep, they will take care of you here. Order a huge online order? Yep, they will have it all ready for you upon arrival and help you out to the car. Need lunch in freaky fast? They definitely got you covered. I'm a #9 or #16 kinda girl. I love mine on the 9 grain bread over the French bread. And I even like it \"unwich\" style. No bread, lettuce wrap. You'd be surprised how those are much better than a sandwich on bread. Don't forget your pickle. They have the best. Whole, halved or quartered. And those cookies never made anyone mad either."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is one of my favorite sandwich shops!  They are always so fast and accurate!  My favorite sandwich is the #4 Turkey Tom! They bread is the best, its baked just right!  Topped with the freshest ingredients, turkey, mayo, lettuce, tomato and cucumbers a simple sandwich that hits the spot!"}
{"text":"It took me longer to scan through their menu and finally decided on what to order than it took their friendly and very efficient staff to finish putting together my The J.J. Gargantuan sandwich.  I was only able to get through 3 Sudoku puzzles while I waited, so they were just as fast as their commercials, except the fast talking part.    The J.J. Gargantuan sandwich was hefty (for most), but I finished it even though I wasn't all that hungry.  Next time I will swap out the roast beef for more smoked ham.  Overall I really like this sandwich shop, plus they are just down the street from where I typically park my car at night, so I predict that I will be back on a regular basis.  Four stars!!!  Love their radio commercials, which played a major role in getting me through the door for the first time."}
{"text":"I have to tell you all about Jimmy John's subs.  I got one of the #1 subs here and it was good. I like that they don't make you tell them what to put on the sandwich. I go to Chipotle and they want me to tell them how to make a burrito. I go to Subway and they just look at me waiting for me to ask them to please bust that green pepper ring into a strip to put on the grubby sandwich. They finger up my sandwich at Subway and it smells like vomitus in there. Not at Jimmy Johns. No smell. No fingering. Sandwich. Just sandwichness.  And they don't judge me in there. I was having a bad day, thinking of a friend I had lost - it was a silly fight. He said some things. I felt bad. I wept like a toddler in the checkout line. They didn't say a word. I got my sandwich, crawled into a booth and ate it, sniffling and doing that weird breathing thing when you're done crying and you kind of go, real fast, 'hoooo ha hoooo.\" Don't act like you never done it... Anyway, what is it about a good sub that makes things okay?  Also, you don't have to choose from nine different buns. They got white bread and it was alright.   You know what they need in a place like this? Pickles. Real good pickles would go great with one of these awesome sandwiches. Crunch! Crunch! Crunch! Pickle would have made it awesomer. Yep."}
{"text":"I noticed this new location a few weeks ago and today on my lunch I drove over there.   I ordered my lunch the staff was very friendly and polite.   I couldn't help but notice how clean the restaurant was also.  I got my sandwich at lightning speed and sat down to eat it.     While I was enjoying my lunch ,   I noticed there was a handicapped man trying to get in the front door.  An employee named   GEORGE ran to the front door and held it open for him to come in.   He then took the man's order from the customer side of the counter.   When the man's order was done George asked if he needed napkins things like that.   George then neatly packed the mans order in a bag and the man asked him to put the bag in the back pack that was attacked to the pack of his wheel chair scooter.   George did as the man asked him and then walked him to the front door held it open and asked the man if he needed any additional help getting to his car or anything.   I was very impressed by how nice he was to the man and above and beyond he went for him.    Jimmy Johns makes great sandwiches and I love them.   But call it what you want its fast food.   I am not use to seeing people working in fast food acting like that.     My uncle was in a wheel chair and I saw many times how people treated him like he wasnt even there.   I gave George a big tip and plan on giving them all my future business.   Oh and the food is great too!   Great Job!"}
{"text":"To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement. This location is terribly slow. This is now the second time in a row my order has taken an hour to be received. Don't bother wasting your time complaining to a manager as they clearly don't give a single  care. Needless to say DON'T ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION!"}
{"text":"Great service,  tasty sub (Billy Club+hot peppers), very clean establishment, tons of staff! Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Freaky fast service - came in and was kindly welcomed by a lady who took my order and handled my money with the same gloves  she used to help with the sandwiches mmm it was fun watching her help with the online orders but with my stuff mmm yeah maybe it was to protect her hands and not so much the food. Lord knows what shenanigans are at other freaky fast places but yeah 3 stars off."}
{"text":"Ordered online. It was super easy to customize my order. It only took a minute or so to confirm the order through e-mail. Left immediately afterwards by the time I got there it was waiting for me."}
{"text":"Jimmy johns is great ...this is my favorite sup place .. will definitely visit again .. thank you jimmy johns team"}
{"text":"I Have to say Wow! The crew here is on point. I know they're fast but I was blown away with the Crazy speed at which I received my sandwich. And.......and it was Delicious!  By the time I placed my order and got my receipt my sandwich was being handed to me nicely wrapped and with napkins in tow.  DAMN THEY ARE GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Really annoyed that there are 3 JJ locations within close proximity to my home (less than 5 miles), yet none of them deliver \"that far\". Ugghhhh! Defeats the advantage of ordering online at a place that purports \"freaky fast\" delivery. But I do love my #15 with extra cukes so... What's a girl to do? 3 stars for my inconvenience."}
{"text":"As always, greeted as we came through the door, we were not let down.  We had the gargantuan a switch as split it - just enough when it is split.  Great service group here!!!"}
{"text":"we just ordered from here for delivery and a guy named albert messed up on our orders. when we called back to to tell them they messed up he decided to act and speak like it was our fault.. we tipped the driver good cuz it wasnt her failt and she was nice..   it sux we always have great service and food from them till now"}
{"text":"Don't even bother! Not sure what exactly they do. They have like 10 people there but no one can deliver a sandwich that's is a block away. I order while I was getting my hair and color done!! Yes that long and my order never came. I had to stop by to void it. You think they will have the sandwich ready for me then ? Mmm no! So can't tell if they are even good. Bad experience all together. And they say I will get a few sandwich next time I come?? How? I won't be stopping by ever again."}
{"text":"I admit it. I was curious about Jimmy John's because of their commercials. You know, the ones where they talk reeeeally fast. We saw them delivering to neighbors across the street and decided to try it out for ourselves.  The first time we ordered delivery, we caught then on a bad day (sort of). Placed the order online, which was great because the website was simple and easy to navigate through. Sometimes I feel it is more convenient than ordering in person and saying \"Can I get the Italian Night Club on French Bread with no tomatoes, onions and mayo. Also I would like to add extra Italian dressing and Dijon mustard..... Oh, and maybe some bacon as well. Can you also cut my sandwich in half?\" They took 20 minutes to show up at our house, which wasn't too bad. An employee even called to let me know that their driver was running late. That was nice of them. Yes, they do add delivery charges, but who doesn't nowadays? We have ordered delivery from here several times already, and they have always delivered in about 10 minutes. So, I guess they really do have \"freaky fast delivery!\"  All the sandwiches I have tried have been pretty good. My favorite is the #12: Beach Club. The Italian subs are good, but could use more Italian dressing. One thing that really stood out for me was that the sandwiches are clean and hold up very well. Don't you just hate it when you are eating a sandwich and all the ingredients start falling out on the other end? I don't know how they do it, they must have magical bread or something! I have been to the restaurant a few times as well. The dining area is clean and service is fast and friendly. I prefer Jimmy John's over Subway and Quiznos for sure! Its nice to know that this is an option for delivery, since everything else is usually pizza. For the most part, they do live up to their advertisements, except they don't talk as fast. :p"}
{"text":"They made my sandwich backwards. As in they put the veggies in first and meat on last. Made for a very awkward tasting and hard to eat sandwich"}
{"text":"For Delivery I received 2 club lettuce head sub. seriously ?! where's the turkey ? oh look I found three slices I paid $7.99 each  I don't think I'll be ordering that again"}
{"text":"Had an good lunch here. I had the #12 which is a simple but yet very delicious sub. Turkey, provolone cheese and avocado spread. The order process was quick and seamless."}
{"text":"My wife got me a Sub on her way home. And when I she got home I open the bag. I was like what is this!?!? I order a gargantuan sub. Which is a pretty big sub if you have ever had one. and what I got was a regular size sub at the gargantuan price. Needless to say I was pretty upset. Too bad I was really Hungary if not I would have gone back and got our money back! There employees really should pay attention to what they are doing and have some  pride in there work and product."}
{"text":"\"Your Mama Wants You to Eat at Jimmy John's!\" - MOTTO #1 \"Fresh. Fast. Tasty.\" - MOTTO #2  I can attest to MOTTO #2.    x Fresh: Vegetables and Meat.  x Fast: On my last visit, my sandwich was handed to me the second I obtained my receipt from the cashier. No joke!  x Tasty: Consistency! The bread is made of crack mix! Their homemade bread which I see the employees make from fresh dough is incredibly tasty!  Its nothing like you ever had, seriously!  My favorites are the:  #2 Big John (Medium rare roast beef with simple lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo)   #3 Totally Tuna (House made tuna, celery, onions, tasty sauce, alfalfa sprouts, cucumber, lettuce, and tomatoes)  Of the 2, I really dig the Tuna! So Taaasty!   Their $1 Oatmeal Cookie is pretty good, moist and chewy.  Subway v Jimmy Johns, Hmmmm? It's a tough call to make, both have their PROs and CONs.  The major difference is at Jimmy's, you have no choice in building your toppings or option to toast sandwich."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had an exceptionally bad experience with this location about two months ago. She spoke with two people from corporate, and it seemed like they were going to address the issue with the manager and get back to us.  As of today, we haven't heard back or received an apology from the manager. Due to the level of personal disrespect we experienced, I expected much more than a cursory \"We're sorry, we'll talk to the owner.\" I haven't eaten at a Jimmy Johns since.  Jimmy Johns Corporate: I'm still open to an apology. I'd also like to know if the manager in question received sensitivity training or at least retraining on the basics of not insulting people for fun."}
{"text":"Placed my order 52 minutes ago and still waiting.  I called and they said they got behind and it was on the way.  That was 10 minutes ago.  This is freaky fast?!?"}
{"text":"Had an interesting experience at this jimmy johns, I first ordered with one girl who started making my sandwich and then with another one who was not friendly. Then as we were splitting a beach club realized there was no avocado spread on the sandwich, which it was supposed to come with, and when I told them and asked if they had a container or small cup they could put it in and we could spread it on the sandwich, the girl that made my sandwich originally gave me this look of wtf and said ugh I'll just make you another one. And kept insisting on it even though I said no we already started eating it, I just want the spread. Horrible attitudes, work on your greeting, and general customer service. At all other jimmy Johns customer service is amazing. This place is weird."}
{"text":"Beach Club baby! Don't mess around with anything else. Turkey, sprouts, lettuce, tomato, mayo, cheese, etc. Jimmy John's is very, very good and you have to love the entertainment on the walls."}
{"text":"My wife and I swung by here on a whim one day.  It was ok.  The sandwich was nothing special.  You can pretty much make the exact same thing at home way better with no real effort all.  It's just a simple deli sandwich, with nothing really making it stand above the rest.    However, if you need a quick lunch and really dig deli sandwiches, this place is great.  By the time that you get to the end of the counter to pick up your order, your food is there.  If you only have a couple minutes for lunch at work or are in a big hurry to get somewhere but your hungry, stop by here and you'll be back on the road in no time at all."}
{"text":"So, I was squatting down in the office, trying to assemble a marketing banner, when the seat of my slacks blew out. Like, totally ripped open the seam from crack to grundle. My fat ass. In the washroom, I used safety pins to close the seams; the water activated and soaked my left pant leg. Oh, I should mention by this point my slacks were off. Needless to say, I was *not* going out for lunch. Jimmy John's and their fantastic fast delivery saved my bacon...and my dignity.  Feeling especially glum, I ordered what I thought would be a sensible meal: The gargantuan, a bag of chips, pickle and a cookie. Let me tell you, this is more than an ample meal. To the sandwich I added sprouts, cucumbers and hot peppers, all of which swelled this sammie to gigantic, gargantuan proportions! The veggies were fresh, the meat was fresh, the bread was fresh. It all pulled together perfectly. Not unlike my slacks.  Lately I've been on a pickle kick. So, being able to add a pickle to my meal was a ray of sunshine. And JJ's pickles are huge! Brandee even said so when she leaned over my shoulder, saying, \"Wow, your pickle really is big!\" So, there you go so.  In all honestly, I finished all the meal except roughly half the sandwich. It really was a lot of food. Which made me think that maybe it was my pudgy bottom that was the root cause of my wardrobe malfunction. Meh, ef it!"}
{"text":"So my husband goes in to order me a hoagie or what do you call them in the west, subs? He's in there and he calls me to tell me they don't have America cheese for my sandwich he's putting provolone on it, and i can not stand the taste of provolone cheese, so i ask for pepper jack or baby Swiss. He calls me back (im waiting in the car with a sleeping baby air conditioning running) that they have NO other cheese choices. They are a sandwich shop and have no other choices for cheese? So they suggest i go home and add the cheese i like. Really? Im at a loss of words. When I go to an place of establishment that makes sandwiches you'd expect your expectations to be met since you know because i got into my car to drive here to put money into your business so i can order the sandwich how id like."}
{"text":"Favorite sub shop. service is always great always fast and the subs always tastes great.   Thank you"}
{"text":"This location is very fast, and the quality is always solid!  Their bread is always soft, fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"This JJ's is always spotless, and the quality can't be beat.  Bread, veggies, and meat is always fresh"}
{"text":"Ordered a 11and a 4 on the phone. When we called they even said hi is this mike. They said it would be $18.23 We're at work and busy but I look up and said is the good here. My manager said no lets call. We called and they said we never placed an order. Asked for a manager she got on the phone looked up our order said we never end ordered anything. We said we ordered a 11 and 4 plus the price is $18.23 if we did not place an order how would we know this. ? The first thing we asked was can you lo at your caller ID. She said we do not have any.  Then how did you know or ask if this was mike?  So we placed another order. They never said sorry    This is why there getting the one star. We are loyal customers and in out center we have another name brand I guess we should just walk there for now on. This Jimmy Johns is not par to the others we go to. Time to look for a new place for lunch."}
{"text":"Good sandwich.  Bread was far better, albeit less selection, than Subway.  Pickle w was huge.  If I would have eaten the whole thing I wouldn't have been able to eat anything else.  Ordered their large sandwich (Gargantuan or some such name).  Basically had more meat than vegetables.  I'd probably order a regular size sandwich next time just so I'd have a better bread to meat ratio.  Quality wise a far better sandwich over all for basically the same price as Subway."}
{"text":"I have simple request...no tomatos.  Not because I don't like them, but because they can KILL ME!!  That means clean gloves, clean knife, cut the bread on a clean cutting board or as a minimum a clean piece of paper under the bread.  I only want onions on my sandwich...can you please get them from the back...not from the tray where you've previously dipped you tomato contaminated finger into every vegetable on the line.  To include the onions I want.  I know you have a system where you make sandwiches quickly.  But for gods sakes, slow down, listen to my instructions and do it the way I ask you.  You screw this up I end up in the hospital because my breathing has stopped (BTDT...no fun).  On the other hand you slow down for 1 minute, you save a life and make a customer happy.  It only took you 3 tries to get this right.  First try I just walked away because you clearly weren't listening to my needs.  Second try you delivered a sandwich, when unwrapped, had several tomato seeds (enough to KILL ME) between the paper and the bread.  Last try...success.  Wouldn't it have been better for you to listen to what I had to say and slow you crew down so they understood exactly what they were dealing with?  If someone tells you they have a food allergy, especially one that is easily accommodated, pay attention, do what they ask...you just might save a life."}
{"text":"Delivery takes FOREVER (1 hour+) and when your order is finally delivered it is completely wrong! This has happened to us on multiple occasions, shame on us for going back I suppose. You are better off driving to another location or trying another sandwich place. Jimmy John's is great generally, but this location is terrible."}
{"text":"This place sucks for delivery. I thought jimmy johns was supposed to be fast... Waited almost 40 mins for them. Note to self: never used them again."}
{"text":"Let me tell you why you shouldn't eat here. First price board says #3 Totally Tuna $3.99. Except it isn't. It's $5.25 and the employees with entirely too much time on their hands can't get off their lazy a$$ to update the price board.   The Emperor at the cash register, after he gets over his attitude, really how dare I question him about a sandwich. Tells me they raised the price. It's still a mystery to me as I don't get a receipt until the sandwiches are finished.   I asked for Mayonnaise on my Totally Tuna. However he seems miffed I don't want three #3 Totally Tuna. Maybe they're cheaper by the dozen. By the way, don't ask for Mayonnaise it's too difficult for them to put it on your sandwiches.   The employees seem to enjoy each other's company. It's the customers I think they don't like. Here's a tip. Update the price board."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service.  Tasty subs."}
{"text":"I have to say that today I had a great sandwich. It was much better than subway. It was an italian sub and it was delicious. Perhaps the night staff is more liberal with toppings and meat because this sandwitch was more appropriately filled. Good job!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time . The workers are incompete and there okay with that. Rude as crap. I won't ever trust them to make me a sub again. I ordered the late night Italian and it barley had any meat on it. I just decided to get a refund and wasted my lunch break"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Walked into a spotless restaurant with friendly service. Made a great #14 and a special order #8. Even for Jimmy John's, the place was quick. We will stop back in frequently. If they'd deliver to the business park nearby, they'd be on the regular delivery rotation for us."}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is my favorite place for subs/sandwiches.  We order from here often for our office.  Today, we had 3 attorney's working out of our office from out of town and when they asked what would be quick and good for lunch, I jumped up and said Jimmy John's!!  So we ordered 4 sandwiches.  After 45 minutes, our sandwiches still had not arrived, which is so strange as we always get our orders within 15 minutes of ordering it.  The attorney's had to go back in to their depositions and were a bit angry that they'd be missing their lunch.  I called to find out what the deal was and spoke to the manager, I think his name was Ollie?  But I told him of the situation and he accommodated me (I don't want to say what because I don't want people to start abusing the situation).  But he also apologized profusely and was very genuine.  It didn't take me getting irate with him in order for him to make things right, and that, to me, is excellent customer service.  You should never have to wait for a customer to get upset in order to make things right.  I will continue to keep coming here for our business lunch needs.  I have not lost faith in them and it's thanks to the manager!"}
{"text":"Recently I have eaten at this location and the Deer Valley location (Which I could not find here) both times the food has been good. Not the best I have ever had but pretty good sandwiches. They don't have a wide selection of sandwiches or breads to choose from. I think they do that because they are known for speed. However, yesterday at the Deer Valley location my sub took a long time to make and there was nobody in the store. Points off there. Hmmm, however, now that I think about it the guy gave me the more expensive bread option for no additional charge so that was cool! The first time I had a sub and the second time I had the club sandwich bread option. The club bread is very tasty. The sub roll was just a white roll. I don't normally eat white sub rolls. The sandwich was tasty though.I guess the place is Ok. Nothing really to write home about. I just heard Firehouse Subs opened a store in AZ so that makes me want to write home more than my JJ experience.  My friend thinks Jimmy Johns is too expensive for their meal deals. The Sandwiches run in the high 4's or 5 dollar range so I don't think that is so bad. If you get a meal she says it is 8 bucks. I didn't notice to be  honest with ya. I don't think 8 is too much. Just thought I would mention it in case anyone needs to know those things ahead of time."}
{"text":"So, this was my first time trying Jimmy John's. I have been meaning to, but I haven't had a chance until now. I ordered the Vito and got my fella the Porker. I really enjoyed the french bread and look forward to trying the Beach Club with the 7 grain bread. I have a good feeling about that.   The toppings are very simple and fresh. There is a good variety of sandwiches to choose form and two types of bread. They also have delivery which I look forward trying out soon."}
{"text":"Quick service and decent sandwiches is the name of the game here.  I end up at Jimmy John's when I need lunch and have a limited time to eat. Great for delivery as well."}
{"text":"In a rush and need a sandwich, Jimmy John's is usually a good spot for that. This location is even more convenient because it not only offers delivery and walk in service, they also have a drive thru. Fast, efficient and solid sandwiches. I always get a pickle when I go. You should, too."}
{"text":"Friendly and freaky fast service. This location is the personification of everything Jimmy John's advertises.   It's a small shop in downtown Las Vegas, mostly focusing on bicycle lunch deliveries to local businesses. There is some seating, both counter and a couple of booths for larger parties."}
{"text":"Really fun place lots of funny things in the walls that make a interesting read service is prompt the subs are excellent puts subway to shame in some areas best part about jj is that it's not like subway.   For some reason the bread here is nice fresh and crispy it just mends well with the cheese ham and mayo it's got kinda a snap to it that's hard to explain.   Try a white bread sub somewhere else and hen try this one it is so much better. Good value too limited seating it is kinda a small location but that's ok lunch time is busy I don't eat in much anyway. They also deliver which is handy when you want a footlong without having to travel."}
{"text":"Called from marketplace mall area... When i told the girl on the phone, she said that I was serviced by a different location and that they were closed.  Then she hung up on me without as much as a goodbye.  Wow... No effort to satisfy a customer at all."}
{"text":"Just did an online order for two of their sub sandwiches. An hour has passed, no jimmy johns. They have 28 dollars of mine, and I have nothing. So I call their shop and tell the guy on the phone that I did an online order over an hour ago with my credit card. He says, oh we show a delay on that for six o'clock. I said, why would I do that? Then he says we had glitch on our computer. Ok... so... then he says we'll get your order  together and deliver in 15 min. I laughed, and said ok. That was a half hour ago. Altogether, it will be close to 1 1/2 hours for two jimmy johns subs! What a joke! Get your shit together JIMMY JOHNS ON 32 ST AND BELL RD! Oh they just got here comped two bags of chips! Gee,thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Only been here a couple times.  It has been good.  They got my order wrong 1 time but corrected it immediately.  Their delivery is normally solid based upon what I see but they have forgotten the chips occasionally."}
{"text":"I needed to grab something on my way home and decided to try out this particular Jimmy John's.  The food was great!  I can't speak for all the complaints regarding delivery and their orders, but going there worked out well for me.  I'd probably stop by again next time I am there.  Update: I now stop by here every time I am in the Vegas area.  Never a bad experience, always a good one and probably the fastest to get the food ready I've ever been at.  Clean bathroom as well.  Update 2: Still a great location and they seem to have my order ready to go before I even finish paying."}
{"text":"I only ate at this location once, but it was fast, easy, and did not disappoint.  I would have to eat here again before giving it another star, as my interaction with the staff was very limited.  Ingredients tasted fresh though and although it was smaller than most inside, seemed to have a good customer base given the location."}
{"text":"Damm Place looks good, but my order has hair in it , I know it can be worse.. but it was very disappointing to find a long strand of hair inside my sandwich. The waitress was apologetic and the manager Dnt even apologize, he just return my money back , he is very rude.. i  felt really gross out afterwards. Very bad experience."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool, idk what people are complaining for.. How lazy can you be to walk, bike, or drive 2.5 miles??   Anyhow, pretty chill environment.. I ordered online and they confirmed it in minutes and make it minutes there after.. Friendly staff.  All in all I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"While the delivery is freaky fast, I don't mind going into this location. They're pretty much done with your sandwich after you pay. Not to mention, this location always treats you like you're the first customer of the day and they're excited you stop by. Gotta love good customer service."}
{"text":"One of the best chain sub shops around.  Fresh ingredients, good bread and FAST as hell.  I know if I've got 30 min before my next meeting I can be in and out and eating a tasty sub no matter how long the line is when I get there.    Still won't knock out my favorite from the FLA, Larry's Giant Subs (c'mon Larry and Mitch... expand to Charlotte please!), but a great option to have close by the office."}
{"text":"This is a new location and to start: Yay! Finally one that delivers to our office!  Secondly: the service has been great every time we have ordered. The guys on the phone are fast, efficient and the delivery shows up almost as soon as we hang up! When you are busy and have no time to leave the office, service like the Jimmy Johns service is sooooo appreciated!   Thanks!"}
{"text":"So freaky-SLOW that I cancelled my order and called Milio's - 45 minutes later! And this has occurred multiple times!"}
{"text":"Jimmy John's is always fresh and done perfectly. Always such a fun and friendly environment and hard working people smiling. I wills say my favorite part of this place is the fresh bread they sell from the day before for $0.45. I Love buying a ton and using for Sunday's when we make pasta. They make for delicious garlic bread."}
{"text":"Check your sandwich before you leave. This location is slipping - 1. staff does not read tickets and make sandwiches as ordered. 2. Head covering not enforced- 6 inch black hair found in sandwich. 3 manager lame response only offered to make a 3rd new sandwich - no refunds.  Very sad to see the location operated so poorly."}
{"text":"Good location- bad seating. We love Jimmy Johns and have been a faithful Jimmy Johns advocate for years as we have eaten at the restaurants across the Midwest and western states for over 20 years. This review is based on the Jimmy standard!   Food execution at restaurant great. Friendly staff. Location great. No drive through :(  Docked a star due to seating. When i go to lunch and eat in- I have a companion. The problem -There are only 2 actual tables of which seemed to always occupied  full due to height and shape/size. The rest of the seating is bar high chairs with single seats angst a wall. Your view is either a tile wall or a window with no tint. The Vegas sun makes these seat abnormally bright and hot. We also watched several older clients struggle to access - get in and out- of the tall chair/stools. Finally when you sit side by side and not across from your lunch company it's more difficult to have a conversation. Basically- if your a family with kids or want to sit face to face this location is not appropriate. I highly recommend corporate gets involved and fixed this before people realize it's not a good dine in location.  Honestly - due to the seating failure- we'll probably go to the other locations. But the food was good!"}
{"text":"Ordered a #2 big johns, Jumbo kosher pickle and a beverage online. Received my order (delivery) at hotel in 13:44!!! Lightening speed delivery and the good was fresh and tasty. Price $13.00 and total with tip $15.00. I certainly would recommend this place. :)"}
{"text":"How I wish these people would follow my very simple instructions. Call me to pick up the food in the lobby. How hard can that be?"}
{"text":"Usually I give restaurants more chances to redeem themselves before rating them.  But not Jimmie John's.  Their sandwiches were blah...and as the other commenter stated, no napkins, and they give you the evil eye if you ask for more.  I'm eating with 2 preschoolers, I need napkins!.  They messed up my sandwich and they didn't apologize.  And then I ordered the \"veggie\" ,which is supposed to have sprouts.  Guess what? I opened my sandwich, no sprouts, they don't serve sprouts anymore.  But they just opened like a month ago, and they already got rid of sprouts?  How about taking it off the menu so people like me that love sprouts, don't get all excited?  When I complained about my sandwinch none of the highschool kids working behind the counter apologized or offered to make me another sandwich.  They all looked at me with a zombie look.  I'm thinking they were all smoking weed out back or something.  So I ate a lettuce and tomato sandwich."}
{"text":"I have probably ordered 100 Jimmy John sandwiches in the last 3 or 4 years and never had a problem until today. I called in for a delivery order, as usual, and had to tell  the woman 8 times my location before she finally understood. When completing the order I had to read my credit card # back to her several times. A few minutes after I hung up, someone else calls back to get my credit card # again because the original woman made the order for in-store and this was delivery. The only difference is they're going to charge me now their delivery fee. I explain my experience of the giving the order and express to them that they should send the sandwich for free since it was their mistake and for the hassle of the whole experience. When I ask for a cookie for the inconvenience, since I'm now on the hook for a botched delivery fee, they said no. I requested them to ask the manager and he said no.... A $.99 cent cookie..REALLY? In addition, I asked for 4 mustard packets with my order, which is stupid to begin with...offer mustard on your sandwiches! When the food arrives, I have two mayo packets and two mustard packets. Terrible customer service. I won't be ordering from JJ ever again."}
{"text":"Okay.. Jimmy Johns earned another star from me, because the second time my boyfriend and I came here, the bread was softer and fresher....  This time I got the #9, Italian... I got it with all the condiments this time, with extra onions and the hot peppers. And it came out pretty good.  I also got their original potato chips and they were pretty good too.  I couldn't give it 5 stars, because this time, there was actually a wait. And it wasn't even busy. We waited more than 5 minutes which was unusual according to my boyfriend."}
{"text":"My son and I always stop in when it's just us. It's \"our place\" we love it.  The service is fantastic, the food is always amazing. Thank you JJ, for keeping high standards."}
{"text":"Quickest sub anywhere. And their bread is my favorite. Nice people, great atmosphere. A great deal. Love this place."}
