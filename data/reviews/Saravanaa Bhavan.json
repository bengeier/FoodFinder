{"text":"Good value for food however I have always had an issue with their cleanliness. Overall not super clean but ok. Food quality is ok. Overall value 5/10"}
{"text":"Had heard so much about Saravanna Bhavan- we just moved here from California and was excited to give this place a try. The service was non-existant...it was as if they were doing us a favour by serving us lunch. The supposedly spicy 'kara' dosa was tasteless and the potato stuffing inside was a violent red colour- using red food colour does not make anything spicy people! My friend ordered another dosa which was so greasy that it had no taste but stale oil. The thali looked OK but tasted zilch. The little bowls that the sambar came in...that was a mystery...some of them were stuck inside the other- probably the dishwasher could not get them separated- so basically that meant that the lower one was dirty. When we complained the server mumbled something and then never showed his face.  Never going back here again"}
{"text":"Are you kidding? I waited in line for 45 minutes when they said it was going to be 15! We got in and turns out there were no potatoes. I mean I can't believe their service! Worst part is the management though. This isn't the first time this has happened looking at other reviews. If there was a way this would be getting a 0 star!!!"}
{"text":"I was a regular here a while ago...  Their food is close to perfect, not too spicy and everything is vegetarian YUM My fav is the mutter paneer with plain naan along side a glass of mango lassi  however, service here is not my fav i really have a problem when men waiters in particular are always nice to my (now)-ex because they think he's always paying (so they suck up to him -if that's the right wording) and most of the time ignore me, yet when they find out i'm paying, all of a sudden they treat me ever-so-kindly *rolls eyes*  eventually, i stopped going as much as I used to because I got annoyed when that happened..  I'm probably going to go there on the weekend w/my friend and HOPEFULLY service improved...I'll be sure to give another update  ***NOTE: AFTER 6pm (i believe), is when they bring out the mouth watering TANDOORI MENU and the portions are pretty big and filling  and   remember, they serve the special weekend & holiday lunch buffet between 12pm-3pm  and the smaller weekend buffet from 10am-12noon  and the weekday buffet from 11:30am-3pm."}
{"text":"Best south indian food in Toronto. Everything freshly prepared and I am surprised at all the negative reviews posted by some members. The service was slow but maybe due to the large number of people."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy South Indian food Thali was good along with mini tiffin  Pretty busy on weekends  Don't forget to try the coffee ( served in traditional stainless steel utensils) Washroom pretty clean"}
{"text":"New Management is crapy. Quality of food very low. Used to a big fan of this restaurant but will not recommend it to anybody. Please dont eat there."}
{"text":"Love the place. Been going for years. The coffee is really good too. I always get the special meal and my wife the dosa. Both are great."}
{"text":"Delicious inexpensive South Indian food. I had the cauliflower dosa, not often available. Accompanied by sambar and 3 chutneys it was delectably filling for only $8. The new renovation has made dining in very pleasant. If you're a fan of South Indian, don't miss it."}
{"text":"I've been to both the Scarborough and Mississauga locations and I prefer the Mississauga one because of cleanliness and also they have washroom and hand-washing area tucked away in the corner.   This time I ordered the paper dosa, sweet lassi and the special madras coffee.  The dosa and lassi were great.  The coffee was awesome! I'm not a coffee drinker but I liked that fact that it wasn't strong (they can make it strong if you want it that way) and I asked for sugar on the side. It comes in a cute little stainless cup in a small bowl and it has a lot of froth on top.  All in all a tasty meal.  At the end (where the cashier sits) I had some of the saunf (fennel) with candy...its good for digestion and its nice to eat something sweet (and free) at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Terrible service - they can't handle pressure Food served cold. Sambar that's key to a South Indian Dosa meal must always be served hot but was served cold. Their excuse for cold sambar was that they're just preparing it because of the rush. Shouldn't that mean the sambar should be hot?!?  And their servings for sambar are too small. They skimp on the chutneys.   We'd ordered a Kara dosa which they got wrong. Not authentic at all.   Hot coffee served cold. And when we asked for it to be brought back and served hot we got a lame excuse that the milk was just poured fresh, what fresh from the fridge?!?  When they did take the coffee back, it never was served again. And we still got billed for it. We asked for water several times.  Not served!!!  They finally brought out a jug of water as we were putting on our jackets to leave.    This is the 3rd time in as many months that I've made the mistake of coming here. But no more.    This place sadly does not have its act together and gets a big fat zero in both the food and service department. One of the staff even have the excuse that cold food is a 'kitchen problem'. Hello, is management listening.    With this sort of customer service I seriously wonder why the place is busy or popular. If I could I would give them negative marks. One things for sure., they've lost an avid foodie customer."}
{"text":"I am a big Saravana Bhavan fan. Back home in India as well as here. new to Mississauga. food is good. enjoy the buffet specially. Thali with tiny cups and variety dishes is another favourite specially the vata kolambu. I love the cabbage curry too.  samabr vada is another favourite.  I was wondering about the tip money I left for the server. I did not see the server come back for it. but supervisor/manager lady took the money and went inside. I am wondering how much does the server get? I went twice after that day, but did not find the server who had served me. other restaursnts have a tip collection box and the money goes there.  I was charged extra for a coffee I did not drink I brought it to their notice and it was taken off without an apology.  well, I love the food, and I am willing to overlook these thing. D James,  Etobicoke"}
{"text":"Casual restaurant. Food was pretty good. One thing I didn't like was that the onion dosa had onions stuffed inside where as I thought it would have been a part of the batter. Seemed like the onions were stuffed raw, then moistened from the heat of the dosa. When tearing the dosa, all the small diced onions just fell out.   We ordered 3 plain dosa, 1 onion dosa, and 1 uttapam. The bill came to about $40.   This was my second time going there. It's definitely my go-to dosa place."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service.  Humble and helpful staff"}
{"text":"The restaurant has some really good south indian food and more specifically dosas!  The food is fresh and made to order and the staff is very nice.  Like most south indian food the dishs are vegetarian and reasonably priced.  I have been to this location a couple of times now and recommend it to anyone wanting to have some paper masala dosa,"}
{"text":"I love the manager here, he knows us for a very long time. I like their food. The servers change so often that we don't like it but still they are much better than a lot of other restaurants.    Food - 4/5 Service - 4.5/5 Management - 5/5"}
{"text":"Food is good but was not satisfied with the level of service. Don't come here if you are picky about service."}
{"text":"Tasty food , nice clean place . prices little bit high for dosas but similar to some others in the area. Try some of the specialty dosas."}
{"text":"It's been a while since i have been to sarvana bhavan and boy had i been missing out. I have been going to another very famous South Indian restaurant which has forgotten how to serve their guests lately and the staff seems to be very arrogant lately.  Sarvana wasn't too busy at the moment of our visit on Sunday night at 9 and the food was delivered quickly. The dosas were delicious and crispy and sambhar was hot and just as i hoped. Staff has always been extremely polite at this place and i really enjoyed going back to a place that gets it right.  Everybody in our group agreed that my favorite dish, paneer dosa, was the best they have ever tried.  Will be going back there soon and telling all my friends about it too."}
{"text":"Great fast fresh authentic dosas, awesome service. This is definitely worth a trip to Brampton."}
{"text":"We went here on Saturday evening and I wanted to order Kara dosa which they did not have. We ordered mix veg dosa and tomato onion uttapam and requested they make it in ghee which they refused.We had previously come here and they had made our dosas in ghee.The sambhar was cold and when we asked for another one that was cold too.Worst sarvanna bhavan in the world.I have been to Dubai and London locations which are much better than here and have more variety of dosas."}
{"text":"I will never return to this place! They made us wait for 20 minutes even though there were rows of empty tables. Then when seated, again another 15 minute wait and I had to ask to be served. We had a pretty simple order-2 people, 4 items. They managed to mess it up. Food took forever to come and one item was missing. When I asked for the item the wait staff denied I had ordered it-their computer clearly confirmed otherwise. The manager came by and said 'sorry we can't handle the crowd.' Um...you're running a restaurant with a certain number of seats. What are you doing if you can't handle the customers? And to boot-they offered us a free dessert (which we didn't want) but didn't take a penny off the bill.  The food was mediocre. Stay far far away from this place. I'm sure there are better places for a dosa craving."}
{"text":"This is going to be a biased review because this chain is from my home city in South India.   Now that's out of the way, this is the best place to get authentic south indian food. If you are a newbie to the cuisine go on Sunday for the buffet when you can try a bit of everything   If you familiar with South Indian food, the mini Idlis, paper masala and the adai aviyal are something that you can always bet will be great.   It's a completely vegetarian joint, so meat eaters might be tad disappointed - the flavour will make up for it, trust me ;)   Enjoy."}
{"text":"Vegetarian only. I've been to their buffet, great selection with friendly staff. But I found it very very greasy!"}
{"text":"Overall * Came with a friend this week and thought it was just OK. * I'd stop by again if I was nearby, but I wouldn't take another $30 cab ride to get here.  Food * Paper masala dosa (for me) -- I love love love dosas and although I nearly finished it, I thought it was just really oily. I have had better.  * Thali (for my friend) -- He said it was good but was also unimpressed because the restaurant did not allow any substitutions.  Service * Not very attentive. I asked for hot water at the beginning of dinner and only received it after I had finished my meal. * However, they were kind enough to call us a cab. :)  Ambiance * In a strip mall. Clean but nothing fancy. * A corner of the restaurant had a sink to wash your hands. Convenient."}
{"text":"Disappointed ! They don't seem to function to the level they built up their restaurants in Chennai. They don't have a clue about the importance of ambience in a restaurant . Sacha"}
{"text":"Being here with my buddy was a mistake as  they have the worst customer service. Their  paneer dosa did not had enough material and when we asked for it from the reps they denied offering more even when we were willing to pay. They were not willing to provide anything as they kept dilly dallying and ruined our dinner and mood and we promise will never come to this shitty location. The place is unhygienic, they place spoons and forks on table not on the napkin or plates and full of rodents, their utensils were dirty and we had to ask for replacing our glasses as there was some particles afloat in the water.  We were surprised they fill drinking water from taps where customers wash their hands. I being a seasoned food evangelist won't recommend this place to anyone again."}
{"text":"I would not recommend. Not too many varieties. Not worth it. Restaurant is big but the space between tables are quite tight. Guess they want to put as many tables as possible. Hand washing area is a bit disgusting because it is too close to the dining tables."}
{"text":"Great service and good food. Was a bit disappointed that the buffet did not include masala dose and idlis but the rest of the food was pretty good. The Chana masala and puris were great, the rest was all right; would not say great. The service was excellent and very courteous. Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I love the weekend morning buffet here... you get to taste almost all of the South Indian breakfast dishes, like idli, dosa, vada, sambar, pongal, poori etc."}
{"text":"Went for Saturday dinner with 4 ppl.  Very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Extremely clean!!!  Love the hand washing station!!!  Great service and fantastic food, however only gave 4 out of 5 stars for two reasons:  (1) waiter forgot to bring our lassi (yet it was charged on the bill and we had to ask for it to be removed.. oh well, not too big a deal, it was an accident), and (2) the timing of bringing our dishes.  We ordered one appetizer to share, and four entrees.  One entree came first, several minutes later the appetizer came, and then several minutes later second entree, and several several minutes later the third entree, then much later the last entree came.  It wasn't ideal for us to be eating one at a time, lol.  This is a great restaurant to try if those two things don't bug you :)"}
{"text":"Fleas, fruit flies, fleas, fruit flies,fleas...  more fleas than the flea market were flying everywhere...  I tried moving tables and seats, but they were everywhere. The food was only luke warm, and clearly sitting in a pot for days and just dished out when ordered."}
{"text":"Today I went to sarvana bhava with my family at scarborough location this is one of the worst sevice I got I went with my infant baby (I had requested a seat in corner for my baby but the waiter was very rude he was more interested in accommodating other guest though place was relatively empty) and the service was pathetic. waited half an hour for tandoori paratha after finishing fist one and which never cameI wont recommend this place for anyone"}
{"text":"Just had a great meal at the newly renovated restaurant. Dark wood and comfortable banquets. The food was excellent as always. Idli were fluffy and the vada were nice and crispy. The cauliflower gravy that comes with paratha was delicious and the service was prompt and pleasant. The best South Indian in the GTA!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and it was ok for most part. Not spectacular. The food has been ok, but we've always had good service. Returned last week with baby in tow, only to find no changing table in bathroom of this \"family\" friendly restaurant. Not returning."}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday with my dad for some dosa.  We were pleasantly surprised with the texture of breads, dosa and the complex flavours of the bateta and chutneys.  The masala tea was also very good.  The channa could use a little bit of work though.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"An authentic Vegetarian South Indian Restaurant.  There were no fleas, fruit flies and my food was served hot and didn't appear to be re-heated from the day before (Just wanted to clear that up before I started my review)  If you have ever been to a South Indian restaurant in India you would love this place, because they have everything setup just like you are in South India, they have a hand wash station (Yes people still eat with their hands in South India, and a few do in this restaurant, if it bothers you then I suggest you do not go here).  The food is authentic and is priced right, there are tons of Vegan options, this is a vegetarian restaurant, so if you are vegetarian you don't have to worry about anything just order anything from the menu.  There is plenty of space to sit and lots of parking in the mall's parking lot. The place can get busy on weekends. If you have never had south Indian food before I would highly recommend you try the Masala Dosa as your first dish.  Everything here is served in stainless steel dishes, (if you were in South India it would be on Banana leaves, seeing as we won't have Banana trees in Toronto anytime soon, Stainless steel will suffice)  Service is mediocre, if you want something after you've already ordered and received your food it can be a challenge to get the server's attention depending on how busy the place is.  Try something new and different and you will not be disappointed. Meat and potato lovers stay away, this is not a place for you."}
{"text":"So I'll start by saying I had a terrible experience at the flagship location in Chennai, India in 2005. Since then, I swore off coming to this place ever again (no matter what corner of the world).  So after successfully boycotting this restaurant for 12 years, I was forced into going on a recent family dinner.   Now I'll tell you why I will not go back again:  1. They sat us directly next to the cash and a waiter just hovered outside of the register directly behind my seat. Table was not clean!   2. We were a party of 6 and received 3 menus. When I asked for an additional 3 menus, I was handed one without a word and the waiter walked away. Another one walked by and I asked for an additional two menus and was asked why I couldn't share and rolled her eyes?! (Ummm ok)  3. Six people, 5 spoons. It was a mission to get another spoon.   4. One of our appetizers came after our mains because we asked if it was coming (I'm guessing they forgot to put in the order)?   5. Not enough napkins. We asked for more and got 2. (Maybe they're saving money by reducing napkin waste?!)   6. Had to ask four times for extra sambhar before getting any.   Overall, the food was not anything special. There are many other dosa places that serve far better quality food and actually care about their customers. The service is horrendous. We went on a Monday evening around 6pm. They were not busy and many servers were just hanging around chatting with each other. When interacting with customers they behave in a manner that leads me to believe that the customer is a burden and they are not interested in ensuring a positive experience.  Thank you for reminding me why I had not eaten here since 2005 and why I should never eat here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food! Brought many people here for lunch and dinner and they also love the food. I highly recommend masala dosa and gun powder idlys."}
{"text":"Been here several times. Love their breakfast + lunch buffet. Sambar taste extremely good here. and so does rest of the items. I generally love south indian food so I would def come here periodically.   They serve poori and dosa fresh on your table while you're eating which is awesome. my mouth is watering while am writing lol. Guess I'll be going back this weekend again :)"}
{"text":"The food was quite good but the service could be better. We went there 1/2 hour before closing and were rushed to order and our food wasn't even hot. They wouldn't provide refills to the \"sambhar & chutney\" as the kitchen was closed!!"}
{"text":"Consistent good quality, flavors and fast service. My favorite South Indian food option in GTA."}
{"text":"I went here to have authentic south Indian food, however I was very disappointed. Also the quality of food is low compared to their Scarborough location. If you are looking for authentic South Indian food, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just ok.. We went right after lunch buffet got over and ordered thali.. Got the same left overs from Buffett.. But, food was just ok."}
{"text":"I'm not that experienced in dosa or south Indian cuisine so I have just started eating and enjoying over the past couple of years, so I can't say I'm a expert in this or anything. But I must say from what I've tried here I do love. I go to the buffet quite a bit when they have their buffet specials on. It's not a huge buffet but I think it's just right for what you get for the price. You have all your chutneys, masala potatoes, vadas, Idlies , etc. And they walk around giving you fresh dosa as well. I've also on gone on non buffet days and really enjoyed the quality of the food. It always came out fast and hot.  I have read some reviews where people have said the staff are rude, I myself have never  encountered that. Sometimes they are busy but always around cleaning the tables, just maybe not so chatty.  I would say good place for a decent, fast buffet."}
{"text":"5 stars if you eat at a saravana bhavan in Chennai,India, but not here. They are not able to create the same magic here."}
{"text":"EDIT:  I tried this place again almost after 2 years and it seems to have improved quite a bit. Possibly because of the new management. The food is much better now and we visit this place a couple of times a month and are pleasantly surprised with the changes.   2014 Review:  I'm really disappointed with the degrading quality of food and service at this place. I'm not a fan of this place, but decided to give it another chance as my friend wanted to eat here.  The place has been upgraded, which is about the only good thing with this restaurant. The new management is pathetic and the food equally worse. We went in on a Monday night for dinner and the waitress took our order and took close to half and hour to get our appetizer. The vada was spoilt and when we mentioned it to her, she just ran away and came back after a while to say that \"This is how it is\" !!! and she did not even apologize. How Rude!!!! She seemed to have a lengthy discussion in the Kitchen and another waitress came to our table and served our food almost 40 minutes later. She did however apologize for the delay. Much better than our previous waitress. We were appalled at the quality of service here and vowed never to come back here again and recommend people from going here ever.  If you'd like to get good South Indian food in Mississauga, goto either Udupi Madras Cafe or Chutney Swamy or Guru Lakshmi."}
{"text":"Saravana Bhawan has regained its touch after the last review though the Manager can certainly work on his attitude."}
{"text":"Ultimate south indian breakfast buffet! Totally satisfied with this place. The staff is friendly,the food is fresh, Dosas are crisp, chutneys are delicious and sambar is to die for! If you're planning to catch up the weekend buffet and don't want to wait then be there by 10.30 a.m."}
{"text":"This place serves the pure vegetarian south Indian cuisine .. even though I am not a pure vegetarian, I do eat out at this restaurant sometimes when I am in a mood for a light meal .. the thing with this kinda food is that no matter how much you eat, it doesn't makes your stomach go rumbling or feel heavy .. so I guess I can go here once in a while .. The ambience isn't that great .. some of the tables are lined up in the middle of the path and I hate sitting in this area. The service is alright, not the fastest but reasonable . Everytime I've been here, I've noticed that the place is kinda crowded .. so there is a lot of noise but then if I choose to eat out then I should not complain about the noise I guess. Food is good if you are not looking for the typical spicy taste that Indian food is known for. Their spice level is pretty low."}
{"text":"Their lunch buffet is adequate and covers almost all the south indian dishes including breakfast items. Their chutneys taste delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, first time the experience was just ok but second time was worse.   PROs: Good dosas and the price that's about it.   CONS: Their buffet is small, average and limited options.  Space is crammed and there's an awkward hand washing station visible to guests and it's disgusting because I've seen/heard people horking/blowing their nose like they're in the bathroom.  The Madras coffee just tastes like nescafe instant coffee served piping hot.  And the number 1 reason I'll never go back is because the previous time I was here I was eating a vada from the buffet and pretty much felt my molar chip. Spat out what I was chewing on and found a small STONE. Went to the dentist and was confirmed my molar was indeed chipped and now I have to pay to get a restorative procedure done. So no I absolutely do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"There aren't many vegetarian buffets around so I was really happy to try this one out. I was very pleased with the friendly and courteous service and the food was delicious. Just make sure you're up for spicy!"}
{"text":"The idlis are so good! The service is wonderful. Rava kesari is the best. Cheese Kara Masala Dosa is also a must try. The quality of food and the speed at which its served is amazing."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic and delicious South Indian masala dosa --- crispy rice and lentil crepe (dosa) filled with mildly spiced potatoes (masala) --- this is the place!   The crepe is what I'm most particular about. It must be crispy, it must be sufficiently salted and it mustn't be oily. SB nails it! My favourite is SB's paper masala dosa. Why? Because the paper dosa crepe is much thinner and crispier than a normal dosa crepe and I loooove crispy things!   The outer crispy salty crepe is the perfect  partner to the soft potato and onion filling and you eat both at the same time. You can eat it just like that (which I do just to enjoy the two components) or you dip the bite into one or more the saucy accompaniments aka sambhar and 3 chutneys. The sambhar is a spicy savoury dal and the chutneys provide some creaminess (coconut chutney) or spice (green chutney) or sweetness (tomato chutney). All the accompaniments are delicious and I love changing up the flavour experience in my mouth with every bite.   This dish is my all time favourite Indian comfort food. Ahhh it's so good!!! Try it!!!! The place is mid-sized and it does get quite busy."}
{"text":"I have been here thrice...not because I am a fan...but because this place serves decent south Indian food... Fellow yelpers who have ever tried at their outlet in Connaught Place, New Delhi...will call it below average but you can't expect same standard everywhere! Can you?  Service Wise: It's slow and when the restaurant is busy...expect slower service. I went here on this Ugadi. It was packed and they forgot my order. Two gentlemen on my table finished their thali and I got my tomato uttapam when they were done.   They have good servers...warm and soft spoken...but expect slow service!  Food: Decent/ Average/ OK..Thalis are ok...so it the idli/wada combo and Uttapams. Its not at all an expensive place  Ambiance: Please don't expect much"}
{"text":"Won't be coming back again. Bunch of desi employees scamming customers by adding auto gratuity. I'm normally a generous tipper. But they had added auto gratuity to your bill of 15%. On top of that I gave 20%. I literally tipped them 40% due to them scamming customers. It's literally illegal to add auto gratuity for a table less than 6 people. I hope this place will get sued soon. Awful. Won't be coming back for your mediocre dosas anymore !"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit. The first one was back when they opened the restaurant and everything tasted so good. But this visit left me very disappointed. Sambar being one of the most important side dishes with anything u order tasted very poor. It was too bland and watery, very dull yellow in color. It was the complete opposite of what Saravana Bhavan sambar should taste like. The other items like dosa, idly were fine but I couldn't enjoy it as the sambar was very tasteless. I wish they worked on it and made it better."}
{"text":"We went to this location during the dinner hour. The service was good and the servers are friendly.   We ordered a dosa and I went with South Indian thali as its very different than Punjabi thali. The food was average and good for the price and quantity point of view.   The only thing which threw away the stars was; while were eating the dosa, at the end we found a rubber band piece in the potato masala. I told the owner when I went to pay and he was very apologetic and stated we should have told him earlier and he would have made another one for us."}
{"text":"This was THE SHITTIEST first-dosa-tasting of my life. I know it's impossible to rate my first-tasting of anything, but I'm pretty sure when you get a sour stomach and horrible shits after being at a restaurant - it was a horrible first experience.   I really hope dosas don't actually taste like what they did here. The food item itself can't be that horrible or else no one would eat it, right? But you see, I'm traumatized to a point where I might not even consider re-evaluating what they taste like and just leave it at that.   The service was shoddy. The drink prices (non-alcoholic) are shitty for the amount you get, which is close to nothing. The venue looks like a McDonald's in an airport food court. If this is what they think south India should be, then I recommend that Britain reoccupy.   The only thing I'd recommend is the Madras coffee, to-go. That's the one thing they didn't manage to screw up royally.  And paying $30 for all this, that was the rotting cherry on top."}
{"text":"Disclaimer - We have been here at least over a 100 times and keep coming back. I'll do my best to review objectively.  Food - 4 star Service - 5 star Ambience - 2 star Value - 4 star Location - 3 star  Food - As this is a south Indian restaurant, they do south Indian dishes really well. Their Dosa, Vada, Idli, Podi Idli, Sambar are all very good and the taste is very consistent. Their Mushroom Biryani is very flavourful.  I wouldn't order gravy/curry with Naan at this restaurant. I have tried them in the past and was unimpressed. Their special madras coffee is pretty good and it's very different than cappuccino/drip coffee, so it's an acquired taste. So is masala chai. Sweets are good but nothing to rave about.   We like both their buffet as well as à la carte.  If you are alone or are new to this cuisine, visit them for lunch as they have buffet and you'll be able to try different things and decide what you like and what you don't. Plus it provides exceptional value. If you're a group, you may as well come at dinner time order many dishes and share them. They are very busy at the lunch time.  Service - Service here is always warm and friendly. The wait times can be long as they are always busy (more so on evenings/weekends), so plan accordingly.  Ambience - There is nothing special about the ambience. It's very forgettable. Plus the sink is right next to the dining area and some patrons start gargling there for some incomprehensible reason, which can lead to a very unsavory experience.  Value - The food is a very good value for money.  Location - There is no reason for you go there unless you live in the area or you wish to catch an Indian movie before/after at woodside cinemas next door or you love them enough to drive over just for the food (like us).  Tip - If you have never tried podi idli there, order it next time. You can thank me later. Also, order mushroom biryani. If you are not from South Asia(or you're not used to spices), ask them to make it less spicy than usual. In summers, try their kulfi (it's an Indian ice cream). You'll love it."}
{"text":"Excellent for vegetarians and healthy food. Variety of dishes. If you want taste something different this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Worth a 3.5 star rating. We tried  the Rasam soup, Masala Dosa and Tomato & Onion Utthappam. It was all quite flavourful, though I found the soup to be a little too spicy. The mango lassi was quite nice and cooling after the soup. It was fairly busy on a Saturday night, but tables come available quickly and service is quick.  The furniture is a strange mix of marble style tables and old library chairs.  The floor was a little messy with bits of food, but otherwise the restaurant was clean. It's an interesting place; we'll be back to try some other options."}
{"text":"Brunch (Vegetarian)  Food, Value: 4/5 Ambience, service: 3  Return: if in the area likely.  This place has improved the quality of its brunch and presentation."}
{"text":"This rating is for horrible customer service.. we went on a weekend, they say that they serve dosa and puri for buffet however you would have better luck winning the lottery than getting any of those .. moreover I wish they would be honest about it than keep us waiting like we are eating for free.. So if you want to have dosa or puri (which is the most common cuisine in a South Indian restaurant ) I would highly recommend anywhere but here ..."}
{"text":"For my money, Saravana Bhavan is just perfect. food for a great price.  Crispy, smooth dosas and bubbly, chewy uttapam.  The Sambar is just like Dosa in SF, packed full of leaves, seeds, and spices that hit your taste buds in all the right places!  The staff are super nice and kept making sure we were satisfied. \"More sambar, More Chutney?\"  Yes, please!  After getting way more than 2 people could eat (come in groups) we packed it up and of course left with more sambar and more chutney.   Sat and Sun, the buffet offers all the south indian food you could eat, (AYCE) and desserts. Try just a bite of these super sugary, fried desserts and think about jogging back to downtown TO."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food in town, with a good vibe. I always order a lassi when I'm there. Ordered a special for under $10, and shared it with another girlfriend. The joy of it is you can try a little of every sauce, curry, yogurt variety. Just the meal itself is a colour of joy"}
{"text":"This restaurant is huge! I'm sure it will seat at least 20+ families. Service is extremely friendly and quick. We were a family of 6 adults and a kid and we all tried the weekend lunch buffet. The spread included 6 curry veggies(subjis), 3 dry veggies (poriyal), pakoda (fried veggie appetizer), dal rice (bisi bele), biriyani (fried rice), yogurt rice, pickle, papad, raitha, and 3 choices of sweets. This is in addition to the dosas (rice pancakes) and puri/naan (bread/Roti) that can be ordered separately at the table. Needles to say, we all thoroughly enjoyed and were so stuffed. We also got a cup of coffee each to seal the meal   - very traditional style. Highly recommend their lunch buffet, if you crave Indian/south Indian food or if you simply miss home"}
{"text":"I've been taking my family here (Scarborough location) for a couple of years and this place never disappoints.  The customer service is nice and friendly and the food is always fresh and hot.   We love their weekend breakfast buffet. It's got all the right food items and fresh hot dosas and puris are served to you at your table!. And the filter coffee here is the best I've ever had!!    The lunch buffet was good too. And evening thalis are amazing as well.   And one of the few restaurants where I was comfortable using the washrooms. It was so clean!!   I've been to other South Indian restaurants and I always end up comparing them to Saravana Bhavan and none of them come up to the mark.   Bottom line: if u like South Indian food we should give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Quality has gone down. Medu vadas were oily and reheated. Dosa lacked flavour. Sambhar was thick and luke warm. I think they are expanding their menu and losing sight of the dishes they are famous for. Vermicelli was overcooked and mushy. I gave it 3 stars coz the ambience was pleasent but the food did not satisfy. Sorry sarvana i used to choose to come here for special occasions, but now i will think twice."}
{"text":"The service at this place is horrible. The desert was cold so I requested that they warm it up. The server kept staring for 3 mins and then took it away and got it back without heating it up. The masala dosa barely had any masala in it. The servers don't smile or knowledge any patrons even when ppl keep calling them. Bad experience over all."}
{"text":"Three stars for the absolutely amazing delicious food. They lose two stars from me because their service is HORRIBLE. Not only are they EXTREMELY slow, they don't actually care about it. They forgot half of our meal about 20 minutes after the first part was brought to the table they \"remembered\" one dish was completely forgotten about, had to ask (the girl who was sitting on her phone in the corner) to please it to us. We couldn't even get them to bring the bill after asking twice.   If you don't mind waiting or being ignored. At least the food is very good."}
{"text":"Best South Indian buffet we have ever had in North America. Excellent food and service"}
{"text":"AMAZING food. Best dosa ever. Lots of variety at resonable prices."}
{"text":"I tired their Special Thali today ( only thali on the menu ) and it was fantastic, it was a gloomy day and it was just pefect, 14 items all veggie, it took about 10 minutes to get my order ready, that is kind of odd I would say as they were not busy all all when I entered, that being said it was worth it..the food you could just tell was fresh and clean.  They also renovated, the place looks way better than before, they added some booths as well . so if you are in the mood for some spicy south indian cusine, give this place a try.   Please note: If you are trying south indian food for the first time, it is pretty spicy :)  thanks for reading   PS. the service is a bit  odd but not rude. so dont be surpised if you find your server to be a little odd :)"}
{"text":"Love the food.. We order thali last time, my god there was so much to eat.. Every bit of dish tastes heavenly.."}
{"text":"I Love the food here - the layers and complexity of spices are amazing. I am not a vegetarian (I love meat) but this place will make you forget the meat!   The overall look of the restaurant could use a lift...it's a little tired. The wait staff was excellent!"}
{"text":"I've been here for years since they first opened. No longer come here as much. The food here is decent and good, don't get me wrong... But it's nothing to rave about.   Bruce buffet: decent Dosas: good but nothing spectacular Rasa/sambar vada: pretty good... One of my faves Puri/curries: not the tastiest.   It's not innovative or new, just decent/good South Indian cuisine. To be fair, of all the times I've been, the foods never been bad... I've just never experienced the 'dang that was good' feeling here.  Though I personally think it Is beyond absurd to charge for extra pappadum when you get a rice dish (I think it was at least $1.00)... Seriously. It's going to Take me a while to get over that one."}
{"text":"Reasonably good food but again the downside with this place, just like most other Indian restaurants is the service. The servers are unsmiling but not as bad as in most other Indian places. Depending on the time of the day, be prepared to endure some heavily irritating and ill mannered crowd. The food is however quite delicious and very fresh. For this reason I will keep on going back."}
{"text":"We  often go to this restaurant as my south Indian son-in-law really likes this place for the buffet. (He used to go one of the locations when he lived in Chennai for several years.) For nonIndians, the food is totally vegetarian, from the southern state of Tamil Nadu and therefore does not have some of the standard north Indian dishes that most anglo-Canadians know. The buffet has a good variety of dishes and they will bring hot dosas and puris to your table.  Yummy! Be sure to try the south Indian coffee served in a metal cup and bowl (you pour the forth to cool it). The customers are almost all south Indian and if you go during Diwali,it will be very busy."}
{"text":"On the name of Chennai's Saravana Bhawan we visited here three to four times but not good as other branches are. Last time visited Delhi's Saravana Bhawan and it was really good. We can't even compare this Saravana to Delhi's Saravana. I didn't liked there sambar and dosa was not crispy at all even filter coffee was like Tim Hortons! Also the thali is limited... Can you imagine?!? For the first time I experienced this kind of thing... We just needed 1 extra poori and for that only we had to pay. We visited Bahrain's Saravana also... Even that branch is also far better than this one!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place to have South Indian food whatsoever. I am a South Indian myself and wanted to take one of my colleagues to try south indian food.  Initially I thought of Guru Lakshmi but then I decided this place as Guru Lakshmi tends to get way busy. I have tried Saravanaa Bhavan in Dubai and this place comes nowhere close to it.  I ordered dosa and madras coffee. The coffee came before the dosa. I requested the server to give the coffee a little later as it would get cold before the dosa would even arrive. But guess what, the server plainly refused. I didn't want to create a scene in front of my colleague. Finally the dosa arrived and guess what again, it had hair on it. Yes the dosa that I wanted my colleague who never tried south indian food in his life, was trying it for the first time and the dosa had HAIR on it !!!  At this point I was going to almost lose it. But I kept my calm and requested it to be changed and hoped that there would be no cockroach.  Totally ruined my experience and I'm sure my colleagues as well.   Please folks go anywhere to try south indian food but not here. For the same price you will get better south indian cuisine with NO HAIR in it !"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I have been there several times, for both breakfast (weekends) and lunch. It's an AYCE buffet, with courteous staff and service, and good vegetarian South Indian food. The dosas and puris are constantly being made fresh, and brought to all the tables as they come out if the kitchen. The spice level is mild, which I like since I have difficulty with the high spice levels usually found in South Indian food.  Prices are quite reasonable (10.99 for lunch), the timings are very convenient (11:00-3:00 forward lunch), and I highly recommend it. Try the South Indian coffee (at an additional cost, but well worth it).  There is also an ala-carte menu if you want specific items not found at the buffet."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to go here with me recently because she had often been to the one in Dubai when she lived there and also the one in Vancouver anytime she visited her brother. The unfortunate reality is that while the other locations are good, this one is not even worth giving a second chance.  The food was all way overcooked and didn't taste quite right. The service was ok but not amazing and we really didn't understand why the place was so busy?   We were even hoping to at least have decent Dosa's but they were absolutely mediocre and not worth the drive from downtown to this place.  Unfortunately, I would not suggest this place to anyone who knows anything about South Indian cuisine. To be honest, I would suggest this to anyone really. :P"}
{"text":"Quality and taste of the food has been degraded.. They must have change the chef or they might have started using bad spices. I think it's not a South Indian food at any angle.. I've been in south India for 4 years and I know how the food is.  I came here 5 months ago when the food was good but today (31 may 2014) the food is awwwwwwww.. I hated the food that's why I'm too disappointed."}
{"text":"went there for dinner last night. Service was average. Food was horrible. Sambar and Chutney tasted bland. Dosa was tasteless.  Won't be visiting them soon."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant on several occasions. The food is amazing, definitely one of the best South Asian vegetarian restaurant out there. I usually get the Saravana Bhavan special, which comes with a huge variety of curries, rice and 2 small pouries (fried dough).   However, my last visit was not very pleasant in terms of the service. Fridays are usually the busiest at any vegetarian restaurants. But I felt that they were not prepared and seemed to be scrambling. I went with my family and we had placed our order. One of my family member got their food within 10 mins of ordering. But, it took exactly 45 mins for the rest of us to get our food.  Hence, by the time we all started eating the food delivered 45 mins prior was cold. I looked over at other tables and it was the similar situation where only one or two people had their meal while everyone else was still waiting.  As much as the quality of the food is important, the quality of the service is just as important."}
{"text":"Dosa is sometimes seen as a delicacy. Most do not make this at home. So when looking for a dosa fix, and a proper one, I have tried to come here.  I came here about 3 times this year.  The service is minimal. You get your food, which comes in small portions, and you get out. You pay at the counter at the front. So that kind of tells you what type of set up this is.  Zero ambiance. hard cold seats, storefront setting, in a plaza. Walls peeling.   It is all veg food - no meat.   The dosa was barely filled. I mean, barely. I would say two tablespoons of filling in the large paper dosa.  I would rather go to Annjapar a bit further south."}
{"text":"This place has lost my vote completely .... Used to be an awesome South Indian buffet for breakfast with hot kaapi served with idli dosa and wada and a background music of suprabhatam to augment your weekend into a bliss... But off late the service is unbearable... I used to go as the food was atleast better than the others... Today the food also was a huge let down! Sambhar with no sambhar aroma just daal with tempering of curry leaves and mustard seeds and idli, dosa, wada all undercooked and stone like texture and not to mention cold ..... And a background music of titanic? Really? This has to be a management issue.. Even the rava upma was disastrous ... The table was not even served water!  I would just like to add is this restaurant was special to me and I used to come here very often... This is a yelp alert to other people to avoid this place and not to get their heart broken like me!   If you are still thinking to try this place let me tell you they don't have gulab jun the only star entry of this place and have some cheap kesari...  Thank you for not going and trying out Cora's adjacent to this shit"}
{"text":"Ordered the  Cheese Masala Dosa - was so delicious! Spicy and full of different cheeses  Lunch Combo (which came with South Indian coffee) only had 3 dishes that were good. Don't know the names of them ... Mango Lassi was delish!    The server bright is milk with the coffee and when bilked told us we had asked for it - we never asked or the milk. It was $2... I would have just let it go but the server remained persistent that we asked for it. I never did .. but I did drink it thinking \"hey it came with the coffee ... my partner doesn't want any coffee in his milk. I don't want to waste it so I'll drink it.\"   That's the only thing that ruined our experience. We waited in line for 10 mins. This place gets super packed on Saturdays during lunch!"}
{"text":"This is place is one of my favorite places to go to when i want to eat Indian food, i love the parrota's at this locations.  The only concern is the how they clean their cups and culinary utensils because since they serve their customers so fast there was once where i found stains on my cups and it wasn't appetizing at all. All and all the food is something you really don't want to miss!"}
{"text":"I love a good fixin' of dosa every now and then. When I do have it, I always go in with expectations (which I'm working on) of the dosa rice crepe itself having to be crispy, the potato filling has to be spicy and spread evenly inside the dosa crepe.   Craving dosa, I went to Udupai first (one of my favorite dosa restaurants) but they were closed on a Tuesday for lunch! Hence, I ended up coming to Saravanaa Bhavan due to proximity & time crunch. I guess it was a good excuse to try it out.   Here's what I found at Saravanna Bhavan:   -Mom and I ordered 2 Spicy Kara Dosas. We found them to be rather soggy and oily  -The potato filling was blood red in color, making me think they had added in a ton of food coloring  -The dosa crepe was overly thick -Chutney's were okay; however they really skimped on it. I also found that the chutneys were rather inconveniently served to the left into three portions of the thali (steel square plate) -The sambar was okay; nothing special. For some odd reason unbeknownst to me, they had used 2 katoris (small steel bowls) which were stuck together to serve the sambar in  -As for service, there was only one person serving when mom and I went here for lunch making service slow.   Sure it was decently priced; but the quality of food and service was worth WAY LESS than the $8 we cashed out for each dosa. Unfortunately, food and price do not go hand-in-hand here."}
{"text":"This place has certainly slipped over time. Not bad, definitely not amazing.  Dosa's are what they do best... Just feel like quality has fallen off over the years..."}
{"text":"Loved the food. As good as its Indian counterparts. Didnt like their Biryani though... Something was missing.. Nevertheless 5 stars"}
{"text":"This place has dope dosas! They are so crispy, even though the norm seems to favour the soggy dosas in these parts. Definitely recommend the paper masala dosa (ask for the masala aka potatoes on the side if you want the crispness to last) and a mango lassi to go with it. Super affordable, yummy and filling."}
{"text":"Food - The food at this restaurant is usually pretty decent. While I was here last time I had the Kedu Vada, Idly, and a Dosa. Which was all pretty good, pretty standard fair for South Indian food.   Service - The service here is hit or miss at best. The last time I was here, I ordered a coffee, they charged me for it, but didn't actually give me the coffee, and the manager didn't really seem to care. He gave the most perfunctory apology I have ever seen for such a screw up, he even implied that I was lying, and asked me if I was \"sure\" I didn't get a coffee. I mean seriously? The manager of this restaurant, called me a liar.  Appearance - The restaurant was pretty messy, none of the tables were cleaned up, there was a mess everywhere, and the servers were pretty much standing around, while one guy did everything, and this is pretty common.  In conclusion, the food is good here, everything else, lacks."}
{"text":"Okay, so I was going to start off this review by saying, why wouldn't you have plates available for takeout? They have napkins and cutlery, but no plates. I was cheesed because I was about to get my fingers down and dirty with my paratha (roti) and that's kinda hard without a plate. Lol.  The following dishes are incredibly delicious: G5. Baingan Bartha (eggplant curry - lots of soft eggplant in a rich flavourful curry sauce) G20. Malai Kota (deep fried paneer in a creamy onion and tomato based gravy (think butter chicken sauce. The paneer was super soft and it wasn't in preformed hard cubes.) Everything was sooooo good. The chef got the flavours on point. This curry is top notch! My sincerest compliments to the chef."}
{"text":"How many of you are aware that you get charged 10% gratuity on your bill plus 13% HST on the tip amount?  I am not aware that this automatic gratuity mentioned in the menu card. Can someone advise  if this is legal?  Anyway I think it is a dishonest practice. I am really disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch buffet to celebrate a family occasion...low-key celebration :P  Heard a lot about their lunch buffet and they definitely didn't disappoint.  Lots of items - sambhar is amazing, so flavourful, some very interesting textures. Medhu vada, rice and chutneys are also all excellent. Dosas could be more crisp and more fermented, while the uttapam really need to be better. Kesari is good, nice and sweet, but i have had better.   Its really busy, so the food will get refilled quickly, meaning that it is hot. Excellent service, some of the best that I have seen at a buffet restaurant. On top of refilling the buffet table, they come around to give fresh poori, dosa and uttapam....much appreciated.  Reasonable price. Eat to your heart's content."}
{"text":"Been to this location thrice at different times. The service has been pretty consistent - quick and efficient. I will not expect more from an Indian restaurant.  The food has been really good for the most part. Here are the things we've tried -  The vada sambar is top-class; fresh, hot, soft and super tasty. The bisibele bath is good with plenty of good flavour. The onion rava masala dosa is crisp and filling - the best I've had. One star off for the rava idli that lacked life... Otherwise you cannot go wrong with anything here!"}
{"text":"I've had dosas at more restaurants than I can count, both in India and North America, as well as at a number of South Indian homes. With all that, my favorites have always been at Saravanaa Bhavan. So I went to the GTA location full of expectations and hope and they did not disappoint.  The restaurant was big and bustling - one of my favorite aspects of having dosas on a late weekend night.  I ordered the ghee paper dosa - my favorite - and loved every bit of it. It was its usual crunchy yet soft self that I fondly remembered from India, and it had just the right amount of ghee. The sambhar was delicious and I most definitely took advantage of the free refills. The only thing I wish came as a side was some gunpowder and ghee though I suspect I can get some if I ask for it next time.  What inspired to me to make sure and leave a review was that we had a minor issue with one of the dishes when it arrived and the manager handled it with care and efficiency. She took it off the bill, had a new one delivered to us in a matter of 2-3 minutes and came to check on us a little later to make sure everything was good. It was and we really appreciated the extra care. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in today for dosas. Quick service. Really tasty food. I got the Paneer Dosa and it was so delicious. Perfectly spiced, awesome sambar and really good side condiments - love the mint chutney.  Also got a madras coffee which was fresh and piping hot! Only downside is the size of this restaurant. I wish it was bigger so we aren't so close to other people. But I love it! http://itsylife.com/2017/11/20/paneer-masala-dosa/"}
{"text":"I love this place. The dosas are really good and portions are big. The place is very clean and service is the best I've had at an Indian restaurant. The waiters treat you like your at their home. Whenever I'm in town, I go here."}
{"text":"I have been to the Scarborough location and had a decent experience. I took my family here (12 people) after calling ahead and being ensured that there would be minimum wait time. When we reached here the line was out of the door but we were told it wouldn't take long.  After 45 mins(!!!) of waiting we finally got a place to sit. We were happily looking forward to some tasty masala dosas. Well that's the first thing your order at a Dosa place right? Well guess what, they ran out of potatoes.... You can have a palak paneer dosa sir, our server said. Well I didn't come here and wait 45 mins to eat a palak paneer dosa. We walked and instead of having a nice time at dinner, we ate greasy Domino's pizza instead.  Interestingly upon further investigation, I discovered some older reviews with the same experience. I wish I had read them before. At this point I don't want to set foot in at least this location of Saravana Bhavan. I might consider giving the Scarborough location another shot. With so many options around, please do yourself a favor and go to some other South Indian place in Mississauga where they don't run out of potatoes...."}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet today, was a little disappointed that the a la carte menu is not functional when the buffet is ongoing. But the buffet didn't disappoint. Buffet includes dosa, and the servers are serving the dosas and pooris fresh. The buffet was also very complete in the sense that they offered some dessert choices too. The only thing I would say was a little dissatisfying was that some buffet items were not as hot as I'd have liked them to be. The sambar and rasam were piping hot though so thats a plus. And if you are considering a trip to SVB do be sure to end it with their famous filter coffee!"}
{"text":"I have been to Sarvana Bhavan a zillion times, okay probably not zillion but you get what I mean :) if you are a true south indian food loyalist you will like the food. It offers good south indian food without the bells and whistles like Chinese hakka Masala dosa or the likes!! The food is very true to its roots and the chutneys and curries are cooked in chennai - tamilian styles.    The place recently was revamped and is more organized and looks much neater. The servers are polite and the food is delivered without a very long wait time.   I ordered the thali and it was very very delicious !"}
{"text":"I really love this place. The paper dosa is so crispy! The potato masala is very mild and the chutneys have varying degrees of spicyness. We also love their Rava Kichadi, Parotta's with potatoes and a delicious cauliflower dish. The Mini Tiffin is a great place to start and try a bit of everything. And don't forget to have some Rasmalai for dessert!  Enchanting!  The Rava Kesari is also delicious."}
{"text":"I've visited the place a number of times and their food is good specially their dhossa and puries. They should improve their dessert menu"}
{"text":"This Saravanaa is not as well run as the one in Scarborough. The food is not that good. The dosa was cold & okay. The sambar tasted like spicy north Indian dal! I am surprised since I was under the impression that this Saravanaa in Mississauga will be better than the one in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Good food, good service.  The mini tiffin is great if you want to try a bunch of appetizer style south Indian food as a meal. The dosa, idli , vada & chutneys, barota & kurma, khyma idli are all very tasty. The south Indian brunch on weekends is a fantastic idea!"}
{"text":"The place for Dosa, in my books! This place has always provided the crowds with some great vegetarian food as well as my favourite, dosas! I am not much of a vegetarian, but i would go here for Dosas as well as other tasty dishes.  The service is good, not the best, but still good. The place is clean, and has the sink to wash your hands, without going to the washrooms...a must for your seasoned foodie."}
{"text":"Loved the Delhi Sarvanna Bhavan so was here to give this place a try.. not sure if buffet time was worse time to try the food but my rating is for the buffet food.  Ambience: 4/5 (on any other day would have given 5/5, only issue it's a little small place to have a buffet) Service: n/a since it was a buffet I wouldn't rate the service coz there were a lot of people and food delays were natural Quality: 2.5/5 (food was average, not what I had expected and in comparison to what I have had) Quantity:5/5(since it was buffet) Overall, it was a 3/5 for me, deserts were too sweet food was cold. I will definitely give them a try but not on a buffet day"}
{"text":"Awesome authentic food and well priced Can be quite busy over the weekends Service can be slow, but the food more than makes up for it"}
{"text":"Accidentally came across this restaurant at their previous location in Richmond Hill. At the time we knew that Indian vegetarian food was interesting but I was not prepared to have my foodie's anti-vegetarian bias annihilated.   At lunch they feature a modest but varied and plentiful buffet, while at supper the fare is a la carte.  The dosas are amazing. These thin rice crepes and their wonderful fillings are a meal in themselves. Their Lentil Soup (Sambar), is a joy to consume.  You will taste spice and spice combinations that I have rarely come across, and even the meat eaters will leave satisfied.  This place was a real eye opener for me, and we have returned several times, although we miss the location in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Be prepared to eat with your hands! They have cutlery if you want, but the traditionalists eat with their hands! =)  I am not an expert when it comes to South Indian Cuisine, but they have made me a lover of the food. So that has to say something.  The Good: 1 - Vegetarian - so as a vegetarian I don't have to look through the menu for what I can and can't eat.  2 - The buffet is great, especially as a new person to the cuisine, it allowed me to try the different foods.  3 - There are two hand washing stations. 4 - There is plenty of parking. 5 - They have paan. This is not something I enjoy, but for those who grew up with this stuff, it is nice to know where you can get it. For those who are new to this cuisine, I wouldn't recommend this. It is the stuff wrapped in a leaf when you go out to pay and it costs $1.  6 - It is cheap! I don't recall the exact price, but around $10 for a buffet.  7 - I love getting the candy coated fennel seeds on my way out!   The Not So Good: 1 - Sometimes you have to wait a bit to get the dosas or puri, especially if they are busy.  2 - The idlis are not available with the buffet. They are at the Vancouver location, but not here.   For the Newbies like me, I would stick to either the dosas, idlis or the thali.   Give this place a try if you are looking for something different. For those that don't know, South Indian food is very different from the indian food you get at most restaurants."}
{"text":"Really lovely food. By the demographic present at the place, you can tell it's legit. Great place for my vegetarian and vegan friends out there. Some of their dishes use butter and cheese, just check carefully if you want to avoid thoes.   The only con that I experienced, is the meue. For somone who don't know much about India food, I was really confused when I was looking at it... and the server did not even care to explain everything to us. I've been there twice, servers both times were not helpful.   The food turned out to be great either way, so all was pretty good. Affordable price too. You get  A LOT for the price you pay."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the South Indian vegetarian buffet whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"My mom took me here today. I've had random dosas here and there but am not much of an expert. Per my mom, the portions were excellent, the sauces/dips tasted good and were plentiful, and the dosa itself was very good. I thought it tasted quite yummy but spicy (my mom says that's the point!), and was fairly filling. Around $8 for a masala dosa, which like I said is a good sized meal.  Service was very prompt, and the lady serving us seemed pleasant. The restaurant was fairly full at lunchtime. You order at your table but pay at the counter."}
{"text":"Check your bill! The restaurant adds 10% gratuity without clear disclosure. I added a 20% tip on top. In effect, I paid 30+% for service. And, adding insult to injury, this happened to be at the weeekend brunch buffet with minimal table service. The non-disclosure is deceitful."}
{"text":"Been in to eat and also have picked up takeout. Great menu, fair prices. Food was solid. I will return."}
{"text":"I'm quite familiar with South Indian food, and the Saravanaa chain in general. I used to frequent the Richmond Hill location, like Ariel G., and was sorely disappointed when it closed down.   This location is pretty clean, well-maintained and very well staffed. I usually get excellent service, and I've seen the waiter return frequently to check  up on the customers.   What gets me going East to this location is their Rava Kesari (dessert) it's heaven-sent and probably loaded up with clarified butter. Nevertheless, I'll eat it till the end of time.   I've tried the lunch buffet($9-11) and I've been here for dinner. Both options are just fine, but I tend to prefer a la carte. The Special meal is an assortment of items on a plate, and it's a good way to give everything a sample if you're not familiar with the cuisine. The Chana Bhatura($8) is a North Indian addition to the menu, but what I loved was how round and fluffy the flatbread is as it comes to your table.  The Masala Dosa is a classic dish and Saravanaa really knows how to dish it up, and for those concerned it's gluten-free as it's made of ground lentils and stuffed with spiced potatoes.  If you're spice-averse, I'd probably recommend ordering off the menu, since I tend to find the buffet a little heartburn inducing on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"The Saravanaa chain is pretty rad overall, IMHO, bringing traditional South Indian dosas to major cities in the world. This one needs more staff, though service and restaurant itself is still impressive.   I came here on a Saturday night expecting a kick-ass Masala Dosa(MD), stuffing et all, but they ran out of the Masala potato filling that makes the MD what it is.  So we settled on a Rava and Paper Roast instead, and it was OK. Next time I'll call ahead."}
{"text":"Lost one point for bad sambhar , sambhar the accompaniment with most South Indian dishes was not authentic , lacked flavours n taste . We ordered mini idli\"s soaked in sambhar served with coconut chutney , Ghee roast masala Dosa and poori with aloo bhaji n kurma. All delicacies were outstanding except sambhar . Service was superb too !  Way to go SB."}
{"text":"Great Masala Dosa - the mustard seed flavour of the Masala is perfect. The Parotta was good but not excellent: a bit small and not quite the right flavour compared to other Parotta I have had. The Rasmalai dessert is fantastic - although the presentation is nothing like the menu picture (no saffron strands) and suffers as a result.  I will definitely come again if I am in the area. For those new to South Indian food, it would be a great introduction, but those who are picky may not like it as much."}
{"text":"Somehow after we moved to Mississauga this Sarvana Bhawan was just a block from our new place so obviously we had to check it out.  Come from Madras (the birth place of this chain) I would say it's the same flavour and taste as back home.    It doesn't mean that's it's a great place to eat out south Indian food around here.  There are better options for sure. But if you are looking for good old Sarvana Bhawan taste this one pretty much nails it bang on."}
{"text":"The best dosa I have ever had. Period.  My girlfriend and I went by on a busy Friday night at her suggestion. After living 2 minutes away by drive I was very excited to finally be going somewhere I've heard a lot of good about but had been too lazy to visit because it was so close and because I hate paying for a la carte indian food (they do have a lunch buffet).  The restaurant is very cozy and extremely laid back. Staff is attentive and quick. The menu takes some time to read if you're not familiar with the items on it so I would generally suggest their sampler, a dosa, and a third dish of whatever.  On this evening we ordered: ghee paper dosa, aloo gobi fry, and palaak paneer. Firstly I would say the seasoning is excellent. Food comes out quick and neatly. Prepare to use your hands. I think if you're open to going to an entirely vegetarian restaurant. I need not say more. Come give it a try.  The dosa is the truly special item."}
{"text":"It may not quite live up to the hype (featured in a Toronto Star 'best ethnic food suburb in the world' article, and one of the places that US economist & foodie Tyler Cowan dined at), but Saravanna Bhavan in Scarborough is good.   It was my first visit to a south Indian vegetarian restaurant, so bear with me!  We visited on Sunday for their lunch buffet, which offers a great range of spicy and mild tastes. VERY good paper dosa - luckily an endless supply from friendly servers - and poori for dipping, spicy potato poriyal (my favourite!), mint & coconut chutneys, channa masala...yum! The only thing I wasn't ecstatic for was the mango pickle dish. For refreshment, we had mango lassi and mango juice - filled to the brim, and perfectly fresh and sweet. :)   It was steady (not crazy busy) during the lunch hour (12-3pm), but we didn't feel rushed to finish our meal. In fact, we stayed and chatted by the ceiling-high windows for 2 hours!   If you love Indian food, definitely check this place out. I'll probably be back! :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places for dosa in Toronto mostly because of their lunch buffet which is great value for money. Though now that I think about it the food - especially the dosa in the buffet isn't all that great. It's really important to have a dosa crisp and straight off the pan which isn't always possible in buffet. Maybe they should have a dosa station llike an omlette station instead which would not only add to the experience but would also ensure that everyone gets fresh dosas. What the buffet does have though is hot puris that do not suffer as much as the dosas from being collected before being brought out and good south Indian food. I'm not the biggest fan of vegetarian cuisine but I wouldn't mind eating here from time to time. Not the biggest fan of their property to be honest which is a bit depressing. The mall that they're located in is just the same so i guess it can't be helped. The service though is great and the staff is really very helpful. So there you have it - not the best dosa in Toronto, but certainly good value for people in the east end of the city."}
{"text":"We lived for many years in an area of Toronto that has an abundance of Indian restaurants. I could eat Indian food every day, and not get bored. So why, on a day off from work, did my wife and I decide to trek to an entirely different city 35 km (22 miles) away to sample this cuisine? Easy: a friend who's smart about these things recommended it. This is why I like my friends.  It was a gloomy November Monday when we pulled up to the front door. Inside, the place was buzzing - a good sign on a Monday in November, or any time. It was busy, not packed. And while the physical condition of the place wasn't exactly pristine - chipped paint, torn cushions, that sort of thing - the food more than made up for it.  The attentive server came immediately and offered menus. Clearly it's a place that knows its lunch-hour crowd. After a short but respectable wait, the server returned to take our order.  The range of choices was nothing short of astonishing - maybe 30 or 40 different dosa options. My wife ordered a lentil soup and a Kara Masala Dosa, stuffed with masala-spiced mashed potatoes. I had a mango lassi and the Podi Cheese Masala Dosa, with three kinds of cheese, potatoes, and the spice lovingly called Gun Powder (aka Idly Podi). The server joked, \"You like spicy food, don't you?\"  The soup arrived almost immediately. And then... so did the mains. It didn't leave my wife a lot of time to enjoy her appetizer. I docked half a star for this faux pas.  The good news is, the crêpes were perfectly cooked, with crunchy edges and soft centres. The fillings were generous and delicious. The accompanying chutneys and sambar tasted fresh, distinctive and homemade.  The other half-star loss on this review was because of the challenges we faced in making our exit. As our timing was tight, we asked for the bill soon after we'd finished eating. It took three different servers asking if we wanted anything else before the bill actually showed up.  This is clearly a highly efficient, well-managed machine. I was surprised to note that several friends reacted with recognition and approval when I told them where we'd gone. That's a plus, too.  A little more attention on the customer service side wouldn't hurt.  (PS the free wifi is from a chain restaurant next door.)"}
{"text":"Great authentic food, love the Dosas and Idlies. Try out the idly (14 pieces) and the Mango Lasssi. Good service."}
{"text":"I eat here at least twice a week when I'm visiting home. Amazing Dosas (and all veg!)  (Prefer a la carte to the buffet here)"}
{"text":"As always saravana bhavan does not fail to deliver. Delicious south indian fare at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Great authentic south indian fare. I had the mini tiffin. It satisfied all my tiffin cravings with many bite size nibbles of 5 different dishes. The rava kesari was the only one that needed improvement in terms of taste. Otherwise this place is a gold mine for indian food."}
{"text":"It seems that a lot of reviewers have already shared their strong feelings on the flavor (or the lack thereof) of Saravanaa Bhavan. To be honest, it's not terrible like some of the reviews would have you believe. But it's not particularly amazing either. Maybe if we had ordered from the menu, it would have been better, but we opted for the buffet option, and it was all... one-note... Not bad. Just not mind-blowing. It was food stuffs that helped fill our bellies before we left town. It's closer to a [*][*] experience in that \"I've experienced better\" but a lot of the [*] reviews are unnecessarily harsh.   I didn't touch the sambar. Sambar is one of those things that varies quite a bit even between two people from the same part of India. Personal experience has taught me that ingesting sambar (especially sambar that you've never had before) before a long road trip (or in my case, a long road trip and then a long plane trip) is asking for trouble and shaky leg syndrome."}
{"text":"A great place for some South India flare. They are very attentive with the service, and the menu has some great translations for those who are not as well versed with the dishes. Masala dosa-simple and an all time favourite is what most folks seem to go for...the taste plus the presentation with the large dosa on your plate never fails to disappoint. I highly recommend also giving the tea a try. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"#SOUTHINDIANFOOD #SARAVANAABHAVAN #YELPGTA  I've been to Saravanaa Bhavan multiple times, a couple of years ago. It never was my \"go to\" place for dosa, but after an extremely unhealthy-greasy feeling at Guru Lukshmi one time, Saravanaa became a recent first-pick.   My dad and I decided to try the weekend vegetarian buffet. The restaurant gets super busy and for the South Indian food lover, this could be paradise. However, for a person like me who goes for selective items only (dosa, idli, chutney), this didn't exactly strike much of a chord in my heart. The dosa was subpar and I found the supply limited and fleeting. Every 20-25 minutes, the staff put out dosas that were gone in 5-10 minutes. Same story with idli.   It was fantastic having all-you-can-eat coconut chutney though. A lot of places skimp out on that one in particular.   Overall, an okay experience. I probably wouldn't return for a buffet. I'd like to select my kind of crisp dosa next time."}
{"text":"4/18/2011 Visiting from US  Let me start by mentioning that the food was definitely good (& delightful to my sons taste buds) but for someone who has tried many a Saravana's in India, US & Canada (Mississauga) I feel they should do better. The waiter for one looked tired when we entered at 3pm today. May be he had to wind up all the buffet set up as the restaurant doesn't close in the afternoon (which was actually a blessing in disguise for us). Secondly, some items in the menu, esp. sweets were discontinued but still appeared in the menu (Badam Halwa). Third, the sambar in all Saravnas (US & Canada) seem to be always cold (I ain't generalizing but you may dis-agree).   The medhu vada and idly combo was fresh, so was dosa & mini ghee idly's. Saravana Spl meal (lunch) was so-so.  Overall, I would rate it between 3.5 - 4 for the $$ you pay. I'll re-visit after 3 months to see if they are doing any better."}
{"text":"This is a poor version of this esteemed franchise. Sambhaar lacked any tamarind and looked and tasted like daal. Chutneys were also subpar. The dosa was strictly ok. The Scarborough branch is much better. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a fine vegetarian hidden southindian gem on the right off toys r us. Best part is their service, quatity and the atmosphere is beautiful. I dont want to compare any other restaurant since they stand out differently. We have ordered quick lunch thali and special thali came out perfect and taste wise it was amazing. Will certainly going back"}
{"text":"Love the dosas here. The size of a dosa is smaller here but it is also cheaper. A great bang for your buck. Service is prompt and staff is friendly. The restaurant is usually packed and is also quite spacious"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love meat... With that in mind, I love this place. I know it's vegetarian, but it has lots of tasty food that really show cases what vegetarian food can be.  The paper dosa is crispy, tasty and definitely an experience. The curries, rice dishes are amazing, and the desserts are authentic.   If you're a big meat eater, give this place a try. It may change your mind about veggies."}
{"text":"I have been to this location couple of times and it was decent.  However I was there on Sunday July 05,2015 with my family and the family from the United States of America and we had a horrible experience with the restaurant.  We are 10 people plus a kid and had the worst experience.  We had to wait for over an hour to get our food and two of us didn't get our food and the waiter came twice asked if we got our food and told him that we didn't get our food and tell him what we ordered and 20 mins later we got our food.  But one order was vegetables briyani and it was bad.  Only vegetables were in the biriyani was frozen mix veg that you buy from the grocery store(carrot, green beans and corn) and who makes biriyani like that? It is fried rice which added biriyani spices with food red coloring  and its horrible!! I have lived in India and had food in saravana bhavan but these people who runs the restaurant ruining their reputation.  I would never go back to that location.  We complained and they didn't charge me for the biriyani or the replacement of my food however it was not good enough because it left bad taste in my mouth to go back there.  I personally not recommend anyone to go there or they need to fire the management there hire new management because they suck!!"}
{"text":"Well, it is very difficult for one to get disappointed eating at Saravanaa Bhavan. The taste of the food is very authentic and close to what you get back in India. This is the first time I have ever seen a lunch buffet at Saravanaa Bhavan and it was good. The food options was sufficient and good.  Service was good as well. You will not be disappointed eating here."}
{"text":"We've been to this place a number of times before but today they weren't good at all. The mango lassis that we ordered came half way through our meal. Also, seems like they have decreased the size of the rava dosa. The paneer in the rava dosa seemed old and it didn't taste very good. I told the staff during our meals about the service and the food and they just apologized and walked away. When paying for the bill I mentioned this to the cashier and he replied that we were not the only ones who have complained and that he doesn't know what's going on. Not going to go back to this place ..."}
{"text":"I been to this place countless times and I thoroughly enjoyed it every time. They have a great variety of South Indian Food, it is freshly made and tastes excellent. The service is great too. If you are new to South Indian cuisine, this would be a great place to start"}
{"text":"This place is packed on a Saturday evening but managed to get a seat very quickly. All vegetarian options and endless choices! Wasn't a big fan of the eggplant curry but the dosa and poori were definitely our favourites. Would definitely come back to try all the other menu items and give their curries another try."}
{"text":"I used to love their ala carte menu...now they have all day buffet very bad and stale food.....avoid at any cost....we can't even order ala carte. ...."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, cheap prices! Went there for dinner with two friends (one of them an Indian who grew up in Bombay) and had the thali. Authentic Indian taste, efficient and kind wait staff (our server was a pearl and she made a point of saying \"You're welcome\" each time we said \"Thank you\"), and extremely reasonable on the pocketbook: the total bill for the three of us including tax came to less than $50! I especially appreciated the fact that the food wasn't overly salty or greasy, as is often the case in Indian restaurants. The place isn't fancy (it feels more like a fast food joint than a family restaurant with cheap looking furniture and crowded seating), but it is clean with well executed food, and definitely worthy of five stars here. To sum it up: what all vegetarian Indian restaurants should aspire to be!"}
{"text":"I have to update this review because I honestly feel like the quality of service and food has declined immensely in the last year. We ordered multiple Rava Dosas of which all of them came out as regular dosas but just in a triangle shape. They definitely lacked the suji needed to creating a holes for a real Rava Dosa.    We also ordered a sweet Lassi was turned out to be more sour than actually sweet. When we asked for a replacement, our waiter told us it would be more sour than sweet. This is something he really should've told us before we even ordered it the first time.  After speaking to the manager he only made excuses and reluctantly offered to make us one new Dosa. We accepted but we're unbelievably  frustrated at that point that we didn't even want  the new ones."}
{"text":"Sad dosas but Puri with veggies was good  Went there for the first time was expecting it to be like Sarvana   Bhavan India taste  This  one was quite a disappointment the sambar had  no flavour at all was plain dal  The chutneys are really sad too tasteless cudnt eat them The mini idlis were not good soaked in that flavour less sambar  The dosas were thick ,sad and soggy  The Puris with aloo  and veggie was good  How can they be so careless with the sambar and chutney when there is soo much competition Food not upto the Mark  Not going there in a hurry again"}
{"text":"Five years later, I still have to say that this is a fantastic restaurant.   I ran a Meetup outing here. I got the mini tiffin set, which included ravi kachadi, sambar, idlis and a small masala dosa with potatoes. One person did chicken out out of the South Indian dishes and ordered something Northern instead, but overall, everyone was really happy with their food.  Everything was outstanding and people even talked about bringing family and friends here!"}
{"text":"Ohh the weekend lunch buffet...for a mere $10.99 plus drinks you get the most amazing buffet of south indian veg. items.......dosas, kothu, vada, chutneys, curries, vegetables, papads, puris, rice, halwas, dessert etc.   During your meal they keep coming around with the fresh dosas and puris and everything else is self serve.....sooo good! The buffet is from 11-3pm and is constantly being replenished.   The restaurant is clean and well staffed and has plenty of seating. You must get their sweet lassi with your meal and the masala chai to top it off.   I know its in Scar. so its hella far from everywhere, but hey, add a hindi film from the theater next door and you have a wonderful weekend afternoon!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed.. I had high hopes after having visited Saravanaa Bhavan in New York and Bur Dubai... but here in Canada food was pathetic.. worst Sambhar and coconut chutni I ever had in my life .. can't even make out sambhar by looking at it... even filter coffee was bad... I don't think am ever gonna visit again..."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Guru Lukshmi and they set a really high bar for dosa in GTA. Unfortunately, Saravanaa Bhavan was a big letdown. We went in pretty late on a sunday afternoon. The decor has been recently upgraded which gives the place a clean modern look although it is still based in a strip mall.   Most tables around us were having the thali which should have given us some strong signals.   We ordered the vada sambar but the quality of the sambar was not good. The vada was not crispy as well which let the whole dish down.   The onion and chili utappam was the biggest disappointment. It was so thick and dry inside that after a few bites we just did not have the appetite to finish it. The chillies were huge and it was quite a task to remove them from the almost thick pizza crust like utappam.   The saving grace was the onion rava dosa but they had stuffed pepper in it which was annoying since it was quite strong. The accompanying chutney portion is too small and they were not flavorful at all.   I am never going back again! Go spend your money at Guru Lukshmi. I am surprised they are a global chain with such poor quality of south indian food."}
{"text":"This was probably my third foray into an Indian restaurant but the whole experience was just \"alright\". I came in here on a weeknight at around 9 with a South Asian friend who had proclaimed this place to be amazing so of course I took her word as highly credible.  Prior to this culinary experience, the most I knew of Indian food was a handful of samosas, a few plates of butter chicken and the whole typical buffet spread. I had no idea what Saravanna served, much less how to pronounce 99% of the menu.  At first glance on the menu, I panicked. Where was my fallback dish, the aforementioned butter chicken? I had not realized this was a vegetarian restaurant at first.  My dining companion had told me the masala dosa was incredible and I agreed to order one for an entree along with sharing an appetizer which the menu labelled as \"tasty bites\". There was a spicy cheese filling in a crepe with a spicy vegetable filling in the other. The spicy cheese bite was my favourite out of the whole meal and was very flavourful but the curry veggie one was just ok.  The dosas came out swiftly and my first impression was WHOAH IT IS BIG (try to contain yourself from making a \"that's what she said joke\" here). I did enjoy the dosa crepe itself but the potato filling seemed very basic, like something I could have thrown together myself in a couple of minutes with a few russets and store-bought curry seasoning. I absolutely did not enjoy the lentil soup and found myself only dipping into the red chutney. Yes, it was filling. Yes, it was very greasy.  No, I probably will not be back.  Saravanna was A-OK for a first dosa experience, the service was nice, my surroundings were clean but the location is not great and the food was not incredible.  Side note: my god, the way to the women's washroom is like a damn maze."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a quick lunch break with mum and sister. Service was a little slow and inattentive. We got seated, waited patiently, then had to get up and ask for menus. The food (2 out of 3 dishes) did come out fairly fast once ordered.  Although service was lacking, the food was tasty, spicy and hit the spot. Enjoyed the mini tiffin and a couple of thali. Was quite satiated leaving the joint. It had been years since I last visited."}
{"text":"This place is good for regular, run of the mill South Indian tali fare.  Honestly, there was nothing that stood out as being particularly outstanding.  I didn't hate it but am not in any hurry to run back, which is generally a sign for me that it was ok, but nothing more.  Agree with the other reviewer on here that the dosas are quite greasy.  Not terrible, just not overwhelmingly incredible either."}
{"text":"Overall:  Worth the trek to Mississauga.  Great value, great taste, great people.   Room: Not fancy, spacious, clean  Service: Friendly, even avuncular (more materteral), everyone's an auntie, and frankly a bit concerned that i wanted a second coffee   Menu: Thorough south indian menu, tough to decipher without guidance from someone who knows the cuisine  Presentation: Traditional south indian restaurant, paper dosas are intimidatingly big but that's why you get them   Taste:  Delivers on south indian vegetarian goodness.    Value: There's a reason this place is packed with Indians.  Tastes good and cheap!"}
{"text":"We went during Thanksgiving weekend and realized they only had a buffet for $14-15/person.   The dosas were brought fresh to your table. Dosas were made from chickpea and rice flour (i.e. not authentic). But all restaurants here use this method rather than actually soaking \"washed urad dhal\" and rice and then grinding them and allowing it to ferment (have a bit of a sour flavour which I love).   Sambar was warm but the idlis and vardas and other dishes were cold. Sambar tasted okay.   Three types of chutneys as well as lemon pickle.  I liked the hoppers dish."}
{"text":"Great food but not a restaurant I would recommend if your children have nut allergies. The management puts a blanket statement on allergies but not specific. Brars which is also a vegetarian restaurant lists all nuts in the menu and is a much safer choice."}
{"text":"Why does it have just 3 star rating?  We went there thinking we'll order just a thing or two but looking at the spread for brunch buffet, changed our minds.  Despite being busy, it was tidy and clean and we were promptly attended too.  Everything had a terrific quality! I know it sounds presumptuous of me but I loved, well everything. The thing is even the best items from Ala Carte are dressed down for buffet but not in this case.  I loved their crispy Medu Vadas and three kinds of Coconut Chutneys. They don't place Dosa and Puri among the spread but regularly serve that on your table. Upma tasted exactly like what I used to get back home.  I bowed out but not before sampling their filter coffee. Ahhh, the bitter sweet flavor of Chennai that I missed.  Economical joint. $35 all in including tip for two!"}
{"text":"This place is best so far for South Indian food I had till date in Toronto. We tried buffet and it had everything from sambhar, rasam, pachadi, chole etc. Dosas were served hot and crispy, the way I like and service was quick. Hot Puri tasted amazing with chile and other curries. Typical South Indian style papad and pickle with tasted perfect with curd rice. Seera made is ghee was heaven. Buffet cost was 10.99 approx and its value for money looking at the variety of dishes they offer. I would surely come back again and again."}
{"text":"I first came to this restaurant about 7 years ago and have been impressed EVERY time.  In reading the other reviews I have just now realized that I've never tried the a la carte menu, since I am always there for lunch it makes sense to just have the buffet.  I've taken my husband (not too thrilled since he must have meat with every meal, but enjoyed the flavors), my sons (they love it) and assorted co-workers over the years (usually well received since they understand the type of food served sometimes better than me).  What do I like ... well, since I'm not familiar with the names I can describe my favourite...  I love the mashed potato curry with onions, especially good when used as a filling for Dosa.  They have plenty of other tasty items (soups, curries, lentils) but let me just say that they all taste great!  I would recommend at least trying this place.  It will surprise you.  Even the meat eaters!  My son and I just ate there on June 1st for lunch and enjoyed the food/service very much."}
{"text":"Tldr: Great indian vegetarian restaurant, tasty dosas, on the pricier end but good service. Would come back  Came here with a friend to try it out. This was my first experience at an indian vegetarian restaurant, and it was not bad. I never knew that Saravanaa Bhavan was such a popular joint, and had locations across the world.  My friend recommended me the dosas, and so i tried out the Cheese Masala Dosa. The crepe itself was crispy, and the mix of different cheeses blended well with the mashed potatoes. The chutneys and the sambar were an amazing compliment to the dish. My meatatarian brain was asking me why i was at an exclusive vegetarian restaurant, but at the same time my tongue was yelling back \"you ignorant slob, this dosa is delicious\".   Service was great, but i think the food was a little bit on the pricier end for what was offered. Would come back to try out other dosas and appetizers."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times for brunch, lunch as well as dinner. Every single time - the place has amazed us. They simplified their operation by making it all buffet place - so you pay a fixed price and the menu is yours. A great deal if you are very hungry and don't want to go through the traditional pain of going through the menu, ordering and then waiting for it to come.  Having said that, this place is usually crowded with a typical wait time of 5-10 mins, except on a weekend or a holiday when it can go up to 20-30 mins. Due to large seating capacity, the turnaround time is quite good for customers.  The food is amazing, especially the fresh Idlis and Vadas. Their Dosa is not on the buffet table but served separately by waiters. The sambhar and chutneys are quite delicious when clubbed with Idli-Vada and Dosas. On some days, they also have Veg Kothu Parotta which is quite amazing on its own. They also have some North Indian items on the buffet table but, for me, it is idiotic to have North Indian food in a South Indian restaurant.  The experience with the staff has been good so far. Not very friendly but doing their job very well.  Parking can be an issue since there are a bunch of restaurants in the complex and all share quite small (comparatively) parking space."}
{"text":"Holy godsend! We came here thrice for the lunch buffet, so this review is solely based on that. They have a good variety of stuff for ~$8 and you simply cannot go wrong. The spread includes rice, mixed rice, gravies (South and North Indian), sides, dosas, idlis, upma, chutneys & sambar, puris and desserts. The winners, for us, were:  - Puri & Chole. It simply doesn't get better than this. Every single time we were there, the chole tasted perfect and the puris were non oily and fresh.  - Dosas. The dosas are brought to your table fresh from the kitchen every ten minutes. They don't languish in a chafing dish for hours on end, and that is what makes these taste great. Of the different chutneys, you can't go wrong with any of them - tomato, cilantro, coconut. Or eat the dosas with a dollop of the potato filling and sambar.   - Gulab Jamun. Even in India, good restaurants inexplicably fall prey to the hard-centered gulab jamuns. Here, however, they are truly well done all through to the center, fluffy and decadent.   There were some mixed rice dishes we didn't really care for as they didn't taste authentic. But the stuff that we liked trumped everything else. Definitely worth driving all the way over.."}
{"text":"This place is always busy. We went for family day lunch. We waited for 10 mins after which we were shown our way to a table. After siting for 15mins (and waiting for the menu)  we were \"informed\" that they only have all day buffet that day.   The dosas were served fresh and piping hot and aloo masala was a favourite at our table. The rest of the food was average; uttapa, Idli and medu vadas were all cold. For dessert they had gulab jamun (avoidable) and rava kesari (yum).   In all a good place for South Indian food. The dosa and the rava kesari are a must have."}
{"text":"I can't believe I forgot to write a review for this place earlier. I really disliked a lot of things (service, taste, food quality, cleanliness etc). I think I may be a little harsh with the one star, but I have eaten at Saravanaa Bhavan in a lot of places, and expected the same food, but was so severely disappointed.  Tried the lunch buffet - food had no flavour, half the time the buffet was empty, they forgot half the things we ordered off the menu. It was crowded and dirty. I really can go on. But the most disappointing thing for me is the food itself. I dragged my family all the way since I am ususally such a big fan of the Saravanaa Bhavan restaurants, and was so embarassed.  Recently, I went to the one at Lexington in New York City, and remembvered why I love the food at Saravanaa Bhavan so much, and hate the food at this location. The NY location is clean and nice, and the food is DELICIOUS, fresh and good quality - all the things lacking at this location.  I can't believe people have rated it anything above 2 stars. This place is a shame to Indian food, Saravanaa Bhavan and south Indian food in particular."}
{"text":"Food was good... Service was good... But if you need spicy food.. ask them to make it spicy.. or else it will be mild food... Over all 4 star"}
{"text":"They have a medium sized buffet for lunch. Everything is tasty and fresh from the buffet. The dosa are ordered at the table and brought fresh and perfect.  Excellent quality and selection of dosa at this restaurant. Watch out for the coconut chutney - it's the spicy element!  All dishes Indian vegetarian. It is an Indian vegetarian restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience today and won't be returning. They had a fire alarm go off for about 30 minutes and did not explain what was happening to any of the customers.   When we asked about the alarm the waiter indicated that that \"they were going through it too\".  To make matters worse we had a waitress who kept returning to our table every 10 minutes to clear plates we were still using. As we were leaving we wanted a dish packed up and when we requested this she said \"maam I can't pack it for you but I can give you a box and you can pack it yourself.\"   The food couldn't redeem the appalling service. My fiancee who used to love eating here has vowed never to go back. Way to lose a long term customer."}
{"text":"I would like to update my review on this place based on my experiences since. I decided to try something different other than the usual thali. So I tried their Kara dosa, which came out to be a thick, soggy dosa with a sweet tomatoey sauce. Then when I visited again I decided to give their dosa's another shot and opted for their Mysore masala dosa, which I have loved in other restaurants. They warned me that this dosa is supposed to be spicy but I can handle heat so I was fine with that. But again, I ended up getting a overly thick dosa that was too soggy and tasteless. My brother got the chole bhatura, which he enjoyed but complained that the bhatura's were a bit too oily.  So I feel that ordering something other than the dosa would be your best bet because their dosa's are just not worth it and you can get much better ones at Guru Lukshmi or Udupi."}
{"text":"I think is me.. I am not impressed at all with Sarvanaa Bhavan's lunch buffet. ($9.99)   The food is quite good.. and the spiciness level is excellent.. my friend was like eating them and have runny nose and tears in her eyes..! :P   The waiters always around and bring freshly made dosa and bread from the kitchen.   I think I rather coming for a la carte instead for dinner, because the food in the buffet area I found them lukewarm.. especially when outside is freezing cold... and you really want your food HOT, not just spicy hot!   There is an area on the side that has sink to wash your hands before and after your meal.. that's a good idea but it really gross me out when I can hear people rinsing their mouth and making disgusting noises right when I am eating my food! -0.5 star"}
{"text":"Average! They could do so much better. No exceptional flat ours. Poor is were way too small. Only redeeming feature was the pappadums.  Service is attentive but we have had much better South Indian."}
{"text":"The food here makes me forget that I'm not eating meat. I'm a carnavore and make few eceptions about not having some meat on my plate, but I have to say I don't even miss it when I eat here. My wife and I have only ever gone for the buffet. I eat my vada with sambar,  my dosa with rice and tomato chutney, and my puri with potato or rice. It tastes amazing and I've never left without being so full that I'm uncomfortable, which is a good thing. The only reason I don't give them five stars is because they need to expand. It's always so busy that the service is close to chaos. But I'd much rather have great food and slow service than great service and terrible food. I recommend this place to any meat lover like myself to prove that the occasional meat free meal can be very enjoyable."}
{"text":"We usually go to Anjappar Chettinad one weekends when I have a strong craving for a South Indian breakfast. My review is going to be a mild comparison of the two.  We decided to try Saravan Bhavan a few days ago as I like trying different options.  The breakfast buffet on Sunday is from 10-12 and we had arrived at 11:10 to quite a line up. We were seated at 11:30.  The first thing I noticed was that the dosas, idlis and vadas are much better than anjappar and are really well made. The sambhar and tomato chutney is delicious as well.  One of the reasons I crave this breakfast is because I love Rava Kesari and Payasam. The rava kesari was quite tasteless and the payasam seemed to have been thickened with starch rather than reduced the way it should be.  We asked for two coffees as we noticed that there were no beverages in the buffet area (In comparison, anjapar has coffee that you help yourself to) and they brought us two very small coffees that were quite good. We didn't know until it was time to pay the bill that each of the 150 ml coffees were $2.25 each adding $4.50 to the total.  For two people with coffee the bill came to $29.90 plus tip.   I have rated it two stars because of the overall experience - food, service and pricing.   Final verdict: Liked- vadas, dosas, idly, sambhar and taste of the coffee Disliked: Service, wait time, pricing, poor tasting deserts, overall experience.   Won't return."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here with my group. We were hungry after  groceries and settled on some dosa.  . Having dined here before its the go to dish for most people. My group got  a ghee paper masala dosa, a mushroom masala dosa,  garlic dosa, upma and a Curd Vada  Also I do not recommend anything  on the menu  that has ghee in it ( my guest ordered it against  my recommendation)  because it is high in  cholesterol and saturated fats despite its health benefits,  1 spoon of  ghee has over 100 calories and it will make u gain weight . Our service was  very good and our server  was  helpful and recommended good   items such as the dosa specials  available on Fridays-Sundays which we got.  If you are new and trying dosas, first stay away from anything with ghee /clarified butter in it. Your must order the paper  masala dosa , and try any dosa that is  of the paper masala variation and ask for light spice if you cannot handle  any form of spiciness.  You must also try a  sweet curd vada and get their  Special Madras Coffee as it is one of the finest.  Also try the \"Dinner Special Dosa\"  as they are really good but only available on Fri-Sun after 5.30 PM  So if you are looking for some tasty dosa , there is good variety here and you will  definitely return for more ."}
{"text":"i been going there for atleast 7yrs now. its very near to. we love their food, specially now they started punjabi it really really good. sometimes service get mixed up with orders like when we order food the biryani will come first then naan and curry. or while we ask for children order first it alwasy comes last. as kids always get hungry when they go to the restaurant.. and we get our order and wait for kids order to come and meanwhile our food get cold. it happend even we tell them to bring kids order first, anyway we never had complain about their food and server are there are very nice. specially its pure vegetarian. its clean aswell. we just had lunch buffet there and only weird thing i felt is the girl on front desk i ask if there is any punjabi  food in the menu of buffet so said no only south indian. we sat down and luckily there was punjabi curry so kida were like yeeyyy.... but no naan to serve there was only puris. anyways it was not bad we were extremely hungry so was fine. but i m not fan of their lunch buffet but will go there for Ala carte. surely recommend to everyone,"}
{"text":"We have been visiting this place for a decade. Over last two months prices have gone up, items have been removed from the menu and the usual staff has completely changed.   Steaming hot iddlis that used to be part of the lunch buffet are now extra."}
{"text":"I stop by for a late lunch and the service was wonderful the food is good. at lunch it seems that but they only. The waiter paid very close attention and made sure that I was very satisfied with everything. In general I don't like buffets but this was good."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure why this place gets such bad reviews - maybe the quality of the food has gone down over the years, or maybe people are comparing it to some of the more fancy/expensive dosa places in the area.    I thought the Chana Bhatura & the Dosa that I ordered were delicious and I'm a complete sucker for Sambar. For the price and the quick service, I thought it was a great alternative to some of the other choices in the area."}
