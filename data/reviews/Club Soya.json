{"text":"Avons pris le menu \"classique\" avec soupe miso, crab cakes, et makis. Tous tres bons. Sushi desert... wow! Serons de retour!"}
{"text":"This is a must-visit place in Montreal. I loved their club soya and poke ball, especially club soya.( the one on the left in the photo) Every bite was so tasty and melted in my mouth that I can't forget about the taste till now. Too bad we found this place the day before we left Montreal.  Wish I could have it in New York. Not only the food was good, but also the service is good! The only thing they can improve is miso soup. It was too sweet for me but still good to have it in the cold day."}
{"text":"Love it! Finally some good Asian food near the McGill neighbourhood. Club soya is a great concept with a simple menu of delicious goodies. I had the Dragon sushi burrito and I have to say I think it was my favourite sushi burrito experience. A lot of the sushi burritos I've had are kind of like Poke Bowls rolled up but Club Soya does a sushi burrito with the real emphasis on the sushi. The staff are lovely and kind. The whole restaurant is very simply decorated and it's a very aesthetically pleasing design. Will definitely be hitting up Club Soya during exam season to get my fill of sushi.   Tip: you can add a miso soup (which is a fusion of maple syrup flavour with miso flavour) for $1.50."}
{"text":"Beau petit resto fusion asiatique! Les poke bowl sont délicieux! Très bon service! Nous avons également prit le \"club soya\" et le thé glacé maison.  Dans l'ensemble c'était super!"}
{"text":"Club Soya was located a block away from my hotel (Hotel10) during a recent stay in Montreal for business. On the two occasions where I dined alone I came to Club Soya. The first time I had the dragon maki and it was delicious! I only got a half order and it was very filling.   I could see this being a good spot for groups to share but the seating is a bit limited. They have bar spots in the window as well. Also their service was friendly and very fast. If I lived in Montreal, I would be a regular!"}
{"text":"Fantastique endroit ! Un secret bien gardé de la rue Sherbrooke. Situé au bas d'un énorme édifice à logement et stratégiquement en face de l'UQAM.   Le poke est franchement délicieux. Frais à souhait, les ingrédients sont en bouche une explosion de bonheur et de contentement. La salle à manger est petite, alors pas trop adapté pour les groupes, mais heureusement ils offrent la livraison avec foodora !  Génial non ? Pour 16$, ton palais te remerciera :)"}
{"text":"Really good, for sushi burrito though get either #2 or #3. Small seating area so don't go with a large group. Cool vibes and great music, also the owner is very friendly!"}
{"text":"This past summer I had the personal project of trying all the poke bowls available in Montreal: poké bar, Kolua, Venice, Poke Shop, Resto, Kazu (2nd winner), etc. I am happy to announce that I was successful in this ambitious, self-indulging pursuit and the Lobster Club Soya poké bowl is my big winner in town. Sweet, hearty, great vegetable and fruit selection (i.e mango and pear) with perfectly made buttery tempura and plenty of meat. The rice is deliciously seasoned as well. I might be slightly biased since I live in the same building this restaurant is placed, but I have this bowl at least once per week now. Staff is also nice and very generous with their avocado slices!"}
{"text":"Le meilleur poke à Montréal : le seul que je connais,  mais je n'ai pas le goût d'en essayer un autre. Recommandation du propriétaire,  Marc Lavigne : Pokebowl C à 16,50 $. Excellent. Propriétaire accueillant et chaleureux. Il sait reconnaître le talent de son équipe et de Geneviève Everell, source de ses inspirations culinaires."}
{"text":"It was really quite and cozy when we got there. Food is good and I like the design of the menu and plate. Hope to see more choices on the menu next time."}
{"text":"Un nouvelle place très cool dans la place des festivals ! Vous devez absolument essayer leur poke bowl ! Jai pris celui au crabe et c'etait excellent ! First cetait du vrais de vrais crabe (et pas du *%# goberge) et il etait tres frais et goûteux.   De plus, les crab cake sont fou ! Vous devez les tester !"}
{"text":"Nothing out of the ordinary, .... much better sushi in the sector is available. The place is cute and staff really nice but the food not spectacular and a little heavy handed on the mayo.  We had the tuna poke bowl : tuna super fresh and cut in very small cubes  but no dressing whatsoever to the bowl and the sushi nos 1 and 3. The spicy salmon toll was great, the smoked salmon and crab totally drenched with mayo. Not the best sushi In the hood. Will not return."}
{"text":"Club Soya has classic \"Montreal\" vibes and I LOVE it. The burritos are served in cute wooden planks. The poke comes in nice glass bowls. The white walls are decorated in a minimalist style. Lots of plants. The waiters and chefs speaking in French.   It almost feels like you're in a hipster coffee shop, rather than a sushi shop. And you know what? I am so down for that kind of vibe.   The food is great too! I came here with my family, and we tried the burritos and the poke bowls. All were excellent. I also got the homemade iced tea, which was a nice refreshing addition to my meal. Overall, a really nice cute place! I think it perfectly captures what Montreal is all about.   It's a pretty small place though, so don't come with a big group."}
{"text":"Super endroit et bonne bouffe. Petit mais tres sympathique! Le proprio est hyper gentil. À essayer pour un repas rapide, délicieux et sans prétention."}
{"text":"I think it's a pretty new sushi place that just opened because I've never seen it before. I was attracted by the neon sign and the cozy-hype look of the place. The staff was extremely nice and they took time to explain the menu, which consisted mainly of a few specialties. There are so many sushi places that it was refreshing to see how they created a new concept with it. The club soya was especially good. I also tried their maki which came with different kinds of sauces, making them taste different at every bites. The sushi dessert was also delicious. Overall, a nice new place to check out!"}
{"text":"Delicious! My friend and i found this place while walking on Sherbrooke. We decided to give it a try.  The service was excellent. The waiter was very kind and he explained well the menu. My friend and i decided to share plates so we took two different types of makis and one poke bowl. We loved it!!! The food presentation was very nice and their portions are big. At first we thought we wouldn't be able to finish it all, but we ended up leaving not one bite! :) Can't wait to go back and try more stuff!! I recommend this place, you won't regret trying it!"}
{"text":"Nouvel endroit pour manger des poke bowl tant à la mode! Il faut spécifier que c'est d'abord et avant tout un bar à sushi, donc si tu ne veux absolument rien savoir de suivre les tendances, pour toi très cher, il y a des sushi, des soupes et plein d'autres choses qui ont l'air tout aussi délicieuses !   Je souligne particulièrement la fraîcheur des fruits de mer! On n'a aucun doute en mangeant à ce restau que les produits sont frais, bons et beaux! Je capotais ben raide!! Aussi, c'est tout petit, donc décide pas de fêter ta fête de 30 ans avec 40 amis, vous serez déçus!  Parfait pour : Un dîner tranquille entre 2 heures de pause à l'école, un dimanche pm, une journée d'études!   Bref, j'y retournerais n'importe quand et je le suggèrerai à tous ceux qui aiment les fruits de mer!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent comptoir Sushi! Les mets proposés sont originaux et toujours frais. Le Club Soya, met signature, est un must! Le décor est très tendance et le personnel, très sympathique. On y retourne!"}
{"text":"The maki burritos are delicious! I ordered the \"spicy\" and my boyfriend ordered the \"dragon\", both of which came accompanied with their own mayo-based dip. I felt like the \"spicy\" burrito could be a lot spicier given the name, but it was still fresh and delicious. Unfortunately, this is where the positive portion of the review ends. The crab cakes did not have the delicate tempura-style batter that I expected from a sushi joint, but rather something more reminiscent of the coating on a chicken finger. The dip accompanying the crab cakes also had a bizarre bitter flavour, but the dish itself was still fine overall. The part that confuses me about this restaurant is its love of maple syrup. What's the deal? Our burritos came with a salad that was alright on its own but came with an unpleasantly sweet dressing. The miso soup, which boasted beautiful shiitake and enoki mushrooms, was overwhelmed by a cloyingly sweet dose of maple syrup. You could taste that beneath the sweetness there was the potential for a great soup, which made me more confused as to why they added the syrup at all. Overall, I would come back again if I was in the neighbourhood - but maybe skip the side dishes."}
{"text":"Club Soya is not quite a three-star, yet not quite a four-star either. Though its small menu is inventive - miso soup and mango, apple & tuna poke as an example - its flavours and portion sizes were less impressive.   I began with a miso soup, that lacked the true umami depth and richness that I expected. The maple sweetened it considerably, but didn't elevate the flavour in any real way. There were mixed mushrooms and cabbage floating around, which had more of a wet salad vibe than the usual miso soup accompaniments of seaweed and tofu.   Then I had the tuna poke bowl, which came with a disappointingly tiny amount of tobiko roe on top, although there was more mixed in with the tuna. The tuna was pleasantly cool and tender, the dressing was tangy, and although the interesting addition of apples and mangos made for a beautiful rainbow around the bowl, it didn't really quite match up with the overall fishy taste of the tuna.   However, the service was brilliant - attentive, kind, friendly and fast. Unfortunately, I just wasn't blown away with the culinary experience itself. Perhaps the burritos are better, though!"}
{"text":"Clean and cute little spot. Suitable for a casual or quick meal. Inside only seats around 8 or so and the patio seats about 12. Menu is not complicated and the staff is friendly. I went dinner time and it was half full which make me happy so I wouldn't have to wait much for my food. Had the Pokebowl C which compromised of salmon tartar and the miso for an extra $2."}
{"text":"Pour un bon poke bowl c'est l'endroit ou aller! Premièrement j'ai adoré la service de la serveuse, elle était super enthousiasme sans en faire trop! Elle nous a expliqué le menu en ajoutant ses propres suggestions. Elle nous a offert un thé glacé frais fait et il était vraiment délicieux. Jai commandé le poker bowl au saumon épicé et jai absolument rien de négatif à dire. Il y avait une bonne quantité de tout et tout était vraiment frais!   Prix très raisonnable. Le restaurant n'est pas très grand. Le décor est simpliste mais agréable et il y a une petite terrasse extérieur. Je le recommande vraiment et j'y retournerai assurément."}
{"text":"Vous savez quand on parle d'orgasme culinaire? C'était un peu ça avec TOUT au Club soya! Le menu est restreint (une douzaine de choix, avec une soupe et une salade comme option d'entrée) mais c'était délicieux! La soupe miso a un petit goût d'arachides crémeux et salé, la salade est fraiche et colorée et j'ai pris le poke bowl du moment au saumon épicé et c'était FOU. Le riz était parfait, un petit gout vinaigré et sucré en prime, le tartare de saumon était frais et les légumes fondaient en bouche (la guacamole aidait). Mon copain a pris des croquettes de poisson avec une petite sauce au cari (il n'aime pas les épices d'habitude mais il a adoré!)   Le tout était abordable, La serveuse était super sympathique, c'était peu achalandé pour un vendredi et j'y retournerais anytime! Ils ont une petite terrasse en plus. WOW"}
{"text":"Cute place that specializes in sushi-burritos and poke bowl. They opened end of October 2016. The place has a hipster vibe to it and the music that plays here is really good (in my opinion)!   Menu created by a chef-entrepreneur Geneviève Everell. If you haven't heard of her, well...she has quite an amazing story!  I chose the Dragon burrito (full) and the Spicy burrito (full) and split it with a friend of mine. Along with the burritos, you get a side slaw and a choice of four dressings: spicy, sesame, house, curry. I hope i got it right lol! I also ordered a house miso soup with maple syrup in it. Interesting combination but works. The sushi-burritos were very good! It was made to order so everything was fresh and delicious! It's not authentic but,once again, quite good!!  The person serving me was very nice and sweet! Very helpful and patient because he answered all my questions!"}
