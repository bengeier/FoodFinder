{"text":"Food tastes so bad, and some dishes are really salty. Even the steamed rice is not good.  McDonald's tastes so much better in comparison."}
{"text":"It's hard to find cheap lunch options in the Path but this is a place that I visit often for the variety, taste and value for my money. Love that they have soup noodle options with a yummy broth that doesn't leave you thirsty! They recently added Hainan Chicken Rice which I still need to try before it sells out! My go-to place for Chinese food in the Financial District"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to go in the path when I'm craving for Chinese food. The food is always served fresh and hot,  General Tao chicken and Grilled chicken is a must try, and they also have noodles soup and dim sums if you want to try something differently."}
{"text":"the queens quay and york area has been starving for lunch food options for many years! so, i'm thrilled that shanghai 360 not only adds variety, but also something that i look forward to when i leave the house for work in the morning, and incidentally in flavour outshines its more expensive competitor closer to the window."}
{"text":"The food was cold the two times I ate at this place.  The food is good but when it's not fresh it's not.  I prefer the one at Yorkdale.  The one at Yorkdale was fresh and hot the 3 times I tried it."}
{"text":"I work nearby and this is my go-to lunch spot!  The staff seem genuinely happy and friendly and the food is delicious.  Unlike other chinese restaurants nearby, the food is not greasy.  I bring  a re-usable Glasslock container when I visit at lunch to avoid disposable styrofoam and, unlike other restaurants, the staff are happy to accommodate this (which has saved a lot of space in the landfill).  My favourite dishes are the spicy cajun fish, the fried rice (it's not too oily), and the bean curd and cabbage.  They also have really good hot chili oil to accompany your dish."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for Chinese food in the Harbour Front area, this is the place to go! Way better than the other Chinese food place in the same food court."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!! I've eaten at this place 3 times. The first time the chicken wings that I got were cold and I couldn't eat them. The 2nd time I found a hair in my rice and asked if I could just get my money back after being so disgusted they only gave me half my money back because they said that I are half even though I had only had one or 2 bites and the 3rd time was alright but it is also very pricey. If your looking for cheap go to bourbon or Caribbean queen much better!!!"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. The prices are and quality of the food good. I usually would go to spring rolls to enjoy the same quality food for double the price. The only down fall is that it is located in a food court which is usually always busy. However, if your looking for a quick bite to eat at a reasonable price and great quality this is the restaurant to visit."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place after reading all the great reviews. I tried the eggplant, grilled chicken and the noodles. I really really wanted to like the eggplant, it is one of my go to dishes at any Chinese restaurant but I was disappointed with this one. The eggplant had an almost mushy texture and was drowning in sauce. The grilled chicken on the other hand was probably the best I've ever had, very impressive for a food court! The noodles were good as well and the portions quite large. I'd go back only for that delicious grilled chicken."}
{"text":"Cool, decent food in a food court.  Wow. Shocking!  Noodle bar is good. Noodles are cooked in front of you and wontons are decent too.  Skip the bbq meat though, they will charge you $2.00 for the extra item.  Duck tasted good, but it was all fat and bones with limited meat.    Not as cheap as real Chinese establishments, but they have 5 or 6 different types of meat, and you can mix and match your broth (clear, spicy or tom yum).  The tom yum soup with wonton noodle was the perfect MSG meal for a lazy Sunday morning.  lol."}
{"text":"Located in the Food Court at the Scarborough Town Centre, Shanghai 360 is the Canadian competition to the popular American fast food chain Manchu Wok. Found mainly at mall food courts in Canada, the quality of Shanghai`s menu items surpasses those of Manchu Work, and with large servings, a dim sum menu, and several combo meals, this is one of my fave spots to get a quick bite to eat while at the mall.  Definitely check it out next time you`re craving inexpensive, yet quick Chinese food."}
{"text":"Thick noodles here look like worms, all meat from here are tasteless, broccoli is barely even cooked. I was wondering what will break first, the broccoli florets or my plastic knife trying to cut them.   Side note: these guys scream \"End of Day $4.99 every 20 seconds, annoying the food court."}
{"text":"This is a typical chinese fast food like Szechuan. One section for premade food and the other for soup noodles. Ordered their 2 choices combo with long beans and black pepper chicken on shanghai noodles. Overall the meal wasn't too bad, just a bit salty for the chicken."}
{"text":"Shanghai 360 is a run of the mill Manchu Wok type concept.  It's attached to Ruby Thai in the Eaton Centre Food Court.  I was craving some General Tao chicken, so I decided to check it out.  There were at least 4 people working behind the counter.  2 of the women were a little older, and were basically screaming as loud as they could.  Because they were both screaming, it was difficult to hear either of them, and impossible to hear the others who were working there.  It wasn't clearly indicated where people were to order, so customers were basically crowding around the counter and hoping to get somebody's attention.  I eventually communicated that I wanted a combo.   It was $1 to add a can of pop - not bad for a food court.  My combo included rice, crispy beef, and general tao chicken.  To get right to the point, it wasn't very good.  The crispy beef was un-crispy.  The general tao chicken was meh.  Within an hour of eating it I had the overwhelming urge to run to the washroom, followed by several hours of upset stomach.  In hindsight, the buns that they had on display looked like a better option.  There are several similar options in the \"Urban Eatery\" food court.  I think I'll go with one of the other choices next time I'm there."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The selection of food options is crazy, the lit up Shanghai sign, the price...everything about this place seems appealing except the food. For some reason this place reminds me of an oriental Bourbon Street Grill and perhaps its because their most popular item is their bbq chicken also known as Bourbon Chicken at Bourbon Street Grill. The portions here are big however, the food I found lacked flavor and was very mediocre. Sometimes its good to have 5-6 great dishes than to have 10-14 mediocre ones which I find was the issue here. They do have various meats and noodles/rice/veggie options to choose from if you're looking for variety. Fish options (spicy shrimp) are extra as they are at many other places.   Unfortunately I have had better and would walk past this place to Manchuwok if I had the option."}
{"text":"I went twice with their 'Combo 3' option which consists of either noodles or rice with 3 selections of your choice (with about 20 options) to go with your meal. Thus far I tried the mango chicken, the bang bang chicken, the grilled chicken and the pepper beef. My ratings go as follows :  Grilled Chicken : 5/5 Yummy! They do grilled chicken right with a sweet sauce that make my taste-buds happy after some serious shopping. Will get this every time I come here!!  Bang Bang Chicken : 4/5 Tangy and flavorful this chicken is a nice compliment to the sweet grilled chicken sauce. Will choose this often on consequent re-visits.  Rice : 4/5 Big portion (probably to give you less main food) but it's fresh and tasty. I'd like to try the noodles next time.  Mango Chicken : 3/5 Tastes like... mild mango and chicken? It's OK but I will try something else next time.  Pepper Beef : 2/5 I thought the taste was a bit light on the pepper and there was too much \"cream\". Wouldn't have it again.  All in all, solid food court grub. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I do very rarely give out 5-star rating. My benchmark for a 5-star rating is based on the customer service, and the price paid compared to the food quality and portion received (I think it's pretty much the same among all our peers).  This fast food chained restaurant is in the Square One mall. I came to the location all the time while I was working around by. They do offer the same food selection style like Manchu Wok, Sezchuan and Bourbon St Grill, but also, this place makes noodles mixed with beef, chicken, bbq pork etc.  As the photos that I posted for the visit, my partner and I ordered two separate bowls of noodles, a beef brisket and a BBQ chicken respectively. First of all, I have to highlight this to everyone. The amount of noodles, vegetables, and the meat came with each bowl was unbelievable. One order of the bowl can likely fill up one and a half adults stomaches easily. Customers can choose a boiled egg or a piece of fried tofu as a side. Also, you can choose different flavours of soup base. With all these merits, the price for each bowl is just roughly $10 tax included.   The server who assisted us with the order was also extremely friendly and caring. She gave us suggestions on the spice level of the soup base based on our preference. She also gave a bit of extra toppings without charges.  This restaurant has two food counters side by side (one is serving different options of vegetables and meat, and the other counter which is serving the noodles is right beside but close to the edge of the food court line). If you don't pay attention, you may easily overlook the counter which offers the noodles. If so, just feel free to ask the servers right under the sign of Shanghai 360 for the noodles."}
{"text":"Love this place! I always get the General Tao chicken and Sesame Steak, sometimes the Mango Chicken as well. Took a star off because sometimes they can be really cheap with quantities, but if you ask for extra they'll go back and add some more."}
{"text":"Great location they are so nice and the know me and it's always fresh and clean and they always smile when they see me !! So I high recommend this place"}
{"text":"It's too bad, I choose 2 items combo, I don't why the waiter give me only a small amount of food? Just saw me a girl?  Small amount of noodles and 5 small pieces chicken and 2 pieces fish. Only half amount of my previous guy's order. Please make sure this is business not saving money for your family.  Of course, you can provide different amount of food to different client, small amount to lady, large amount to big guy. Hence therefore you can earn much more money. But I won't eat anything in your store."}
{"text":"Our last meal in the City of Toronto was Chinese Food from Shanghai 360 at the Food Court. We have ordered chicken deep fried rice, spicy shrimp, and mixed vegetable. Besides that, we also had dim sum to share. The dim sum was not very fresh. It seems like staying there for so long. The Chinese food (Vegetable and Shrimp) taste was decent. Nothing too excited. The price of food was a little bit expensive."}
{"text":"Worst \"Chinese\" food ever w/rubbery and greasy chow fun, dry sesame chicken, and bright orange pad Thai.  Stay away unless you are seeking severe water retention from the excess salt and sodium."}
{"text":"Still the best cheap cheerful asian food in Carrefour Laval. You don't need to read what I am trying to describe by words. Just view the over 40 photos. Dammm it's so salty good! Get your rear end there and don't even think about going to Manchu Wok. Shanghai 360 is miles above and beyond better.   A word of warning. The braised eggplant is no longer available.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I go to its conjoined cousin, Ruby Thai, somewhat frequently and like it, so I decided to try this place out. Pretty solid selection - a lot of different varieties of meat dishes. They have a surprisingly large selection of dim sum for a lunch place. Their udon noodles are kind of gross, but I really do like their various fried meats.   Solid and quick lunch choice!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a BIG FAT Zero if I could go that low. I took my food back to complain it was cold & the woman behind the counter told me if I didn't like it to \"don't come back\"! Very nice. Not to worry...I wouldn't eat at this again if I were starving! Good luck in your no success! Treat a customer this way & you deserve it!"}
{"text":"This is one of the two Chinese restaurants in the food court. The other place, for some reason, has a much longer line. I'm not sure if it is because the other place taste better. The line over there just move a lot slower. Their mixed vegetable is okay, the Mandarin grilled chicken is tasty, but their rice noodle, while being not too oily, but is very bland."}
{"text":"I work at FCP and this place is only a short walk. Great service and always fresh food. I'm glad that I discover this place. If you want something that is delicious and great price this is a place to go. Their menu also changes frequently as well which make me coming."}
{"text":"I had a combo plate with the following options:  Chicken bang bang: 3/5 Just ok. More breading than the chicken meat. A hint of spice and sweetness.  Chowmein noodle: 3/5 Good but nothing out of the extraordinary. Just taste like how noodles should taste.  Broccoli & beef: 1/5 Salty, extremely salty! Could it be an off day? maybe.  The saltiness was so overpowering that even with a soft drink I couldn't taste anything else but salt. Felt my blood pressure hit the roof after eating this side dish.   I did went back to the counter and the nice lady replaced my broccoli side dish with eggplant instead at no charge.   Eggplant: 2/5 Eggplant dish was salty as well. Maybe because the broccoli dish had ruined my tastebuds.  A little bit on the greasy part and but overall good.   This is not my first time eating at this stand. I've always been satisfied before.  Service was great but if you are not tolerant on sodium, I would be selective on the side dishes."}
{"text":"Please note that I am writing this review for a foodcourt restaurant and that is why I am awarding it five stars. It's not fine cuisine. However, for a fast food type of restaurant, it is absolutely delicious. The ingredients are fresh. The recipes are tasty. There is a lot of variety.  The kitchen is very clean. And they have some dim sum!!!! Amazing! I never thought a food court meal could be so satisfying And delicious. Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"The best beef soup noodles . They cook in front of you and you can choose what kinda broth you like . But I think is the best is clear broth and if you like spicy you can add siracha sauce on side so you will not ruin the taste."}
{"text":"Being a food court restaurant the most important thing is for the food to taste good but the food here is so bland and tasteless. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Service: Poor - even for food court standards. Good was literally thrown on my plate.  Taste: Avg. I have had cheaper and better general Tao  Recommend: No - there are other better places at the food court"}
