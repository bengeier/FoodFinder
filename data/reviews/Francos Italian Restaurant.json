{"text":"Simply put: this restaurant has some pricing problems. I ordered a Caprese Salad based on the online menu (which doesn't list any prices). While I can't complain at all about the taste of the salad, I paid $13.00 for three slices of tomato, three slices of mozzarella, and a sprinkling of diced basil. I've had full salads in Manhattan that cost less than that! Once again- the food was very tasty, but I won't be going back simply based on the prices... If a modest Caprese Salad costs $13, I'll probably have to sell a kidney to afford a bowl of pasta."}
{"text":"We eat at Franco's about once every 4-5 weeks. Not regulars, so we don't get \"special treatment. The food is very rich, the dressings are house made.   Some of our favorite dishes are stuffed salmon, the caprese salad, any veal. Never had any steaksl. My absolute favorite - a total throw back - is the Franco salad: massive beefsteak tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, shrimp cocktail, lump crabmeat, artichoke and sweet read peppers. We rarely drink, so we can't attest to the quality of the cocktails.   The decor is sound-muting, which is perfect. You can have very private conversations without the table next to you listening in.  The patio is lovely; private and gated yet right on Brilliant.  Vastly prefer the new location."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible.  I love the servers, especially Kevin.  Try the pasta with clams in red sauce.  Surprisingly good flavor.  Also, go in and ask for the \"giant steak.\"  The most tender beef in Pittsburgh, better than a steakhouse downtown it is on the menu with a real name, but I forget what cut of beef it is.  Lets just call it the \"heaven\" cut.  Fried zucchini as an app is really fun and flavorful as well - it doesn't just taste like pure breading like other places, and the pieces are the whole length of the vegetable, so it is really fun to eat.  Great wine selection as well."}
