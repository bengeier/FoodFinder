{"text":"The food here is unbelivebly amazing. My favorite dish from here is the chicken low mein. The service is great and the servers are nice and friendly and greet you with a smile"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese cuisine. They have awesome salt baked pork and Chinese broccoli. The ho fun is delicious."}
{"text":"They serve Authentic chinese food. My favorite dishes are grilled egg tofu, clams with black bean sauce and eggplant with galic sauce. The place is small but service is decent. If you like real Chinese food, you should try this place, yummy with good price!"}
{"text":"I very like beef noodle soup from this place it very good.sasemi ck is yummy too.not so much on lo main and fried rice"}
{"text":"We LOVED this place!!! We heard several other patrons speaking Mandarin and Cantonese so you know it's good! The dumplings, Sesame Chicken and Spicy Mongolian Beef were delicious. As well, the atmosphere was clean and friendly. The family who runs the restaurant are kind and attentive. Definitely would recommend New Wong's!"}
{"text":"We weren't expecting much...aren't all these places basically the same?  Not this one, the food was absolutely delicious.  Don't let the minimal decor in the dining room fool you, this place's food is scrumptious.  My boyfriend and I both had the Sesame Chicken, which was rich and dark tasting.  I can't describe it too much better than that.  My daughter had the Orange Chicken, which was also very tasty.  My son, the sweet and sour shrimp.  Portion sizes are good, we will each get two meals out of our experience there.  The waitress was very friendly, the service fast, and the food...well, if only all Chinese food were this good.  I would drive out of my way to eat their food again!"}
{"text":"Fresh, authentic food, that's always timely and delicious! Eat in or order to go, it's great either way."}
{"text":"Delicious take-out! The cashew chicken and the pork chow mein were wonderful! Good size portions with fried rice also."}
{"text":"Wow. Honestly this place looks like kind of a dump...the best won ton soup ever. It had Savoy cabbage in it which was a fabulous addition. Stir fried string beans and veggie lo mein were all great also. Huge portions, at very cheap prices."}
{"text":"Straight from Chinatown.  The one thing I miss most are the ducks hanging in the smoker like downtown.  Food is always great. I am surprised to learn about the \"second\" menu.  I will have to ask for it on my next trip.  Have eaten here several times and its always been good. Too bad it isn't closer to me."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly and authentic , fresh food with generous helpings.     The sweet and sour special was cooked perfectly and the fried rice popped!   Would try this place again.    Driving by and saw a parking lot full of cars.  Always a good sign."}
{"text":"I always order from their Chinese menu since I am Chinese.  My favorites are pan fried egg tofu, beef on skillet, and eggplant.  I like their ground beef and egg drop soup.   Stir fried vegetables are good too.  The reason why I do not go often is that dishes are always oily and salty."}
{"text":"I walked in about to give this place a try because trying new Chinese food restaurants makes me nervous. As I was about to order there was a little girl behind the register who didn't speak. I said hi to her and she still didn't say anything but looked as if she was about to take my order. I believe if you put your children to work then they should be taught properly how to interact with customers. I ended walking out without ordering anything. Their loss."}
{"text":"We were passing by the area on a road trip and was craving Chinese food and found New Wong's via yelp.  I wasn't expecting much being from Toronto where we have a ton of great authentic Chinese food.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  I've included a shot of our spread.  The food was very flavorful, not too greasy and salty and I didn't feel super thirsty after from too much MSG.    The fried flounder is my favorite!  I've never even had it in Toronto.  The waitress had suggested it.  The service was also fantastic which is usually rare in a Chinese restaurant.  The waitress was really friendly and smily.  Will definitely stop by again if we are passing through."}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero if I could. No one came to greet us or even give us menus. A man that came in after us had his food before anyone approached our table. It felt like they were purposely ignoring us. It felt like racism to me. Food looked delicious, but we did not feel welcome."}
{"text":"I am typically very hesitant to try a new Chinese restaurant, but my husband talked me into trying this place and I'm glad he did. The food was great - not greasy or overly salty. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not good.   I prefer shrimp to NOT have eyes staring back at me. I'd also like them without guts and stuff.   The rice was also terrible and bland and dog-food-like.   Disappointing.   *whine*"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery a couple times and the food is really good. It is not PF Chang good nor is it trying to be up-scale. For a neighborhood Chinese/American restaurant it is very good. I had General Chicken and General Beef!! Which I had not had in years, nobody has it. The General chicken was really good as was the beef. The egg rolls are nothing to write home about; they are the standard frozen egg roll that most local places purchase and deep fry."}
{"text":"i go here for the tofu. all of the tofu. i'm working my way through their list of all of the tofu. they give you these hefty boxes of tofu. and hefty boxes of rice. it's pretty authentic. i have to break out my chinese to talk to the lady. it's delicious tofu. great for vegetarian and vegan eaters who love tofu. or meat eaters who love tofu. or for people who have never had tofu who want to try tofu. or for tofu lovers who want to introduce meat eaters to tofu. eat all of the tofu!!"}
{"text":"We were regular patrons of New Wong's back when it was located in Chinatown.  It was nice to see that they carried over many of the same dishes that we liked when they moved to Wickliffe.  it was a pleasant surprise, since we weren't expecting anything more than the usual suburban takeout \"Chinese\" after the move!"}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy this restaurant.  They have several authentic Chinese and taiwanese dishes as well as the American iced favorites. I always get the XO Japanese Tofu and the fried fish in hot oil dish (fish with chile and spice sauce). Definitely order from the pictures on the wall (that's the secret Chinese menu ;-))"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and was really surprised at how good the food is. I had the governor's chicken, which was fresh fried and came out less than 15 minutes after ordering. Definitely a good lunch spot, but I'm not so sure about dinner."}
{"text":"I'm compelled to update my previous rant about New Wong's, as we found it convenient to try one more time.  I have to be honest and can only speculate that we caught them on an off night, possibly with a fill-in cook, as everything we ordered this time, was outstanding.  One thing different this trip.  We ordered from their menu with the pictures in it.  The pan fried noodles with pork is highly recommended.  Nice, nice people as well.  Sorry for our previous \"rush to judgement\"."}
{"text":"Came back here for lunch while on the east side.  Despite the fact that I was the only person in the restaurant, the service and food was slow.  I tried the Governor's Chicken again, and this time I was disappointed.  More mystery meat than I remember, and although I asked for it to be spicy, it was not spicy whatsoever.  I wish I had read my review re: egg rolls.  You can tell that they are frozen/store-bought.  That'll be my last visit..."}
{"text":"Great lunch today! The schezuan sauce was the best I've ever had! They also make the duck sauce and hot mustard in house, which was amazing as well. The hot and sour soup was good, but the shrimp chips were a tad stale."}
{"text":"I got the black bean soft shell crab and added heads on shrimp. The Flavor !!! And the rice was good. My 2 year old loves his! My boyfriend got sesame chicken said it was the best he's ever had and that it was fresh. Hidden Gem. Everyday they have a special that's $5 or less. Monday's 4.50 for pepper steak!"}
{"text":"Only got takeout of teriyaki sticks and hot n sour soup but both were ridiculous good.  Place is a little rough around the edges and I like that.  The dining room was full of Asian families eating dinner.  Very nice, family run joint.  A true hidden gem.  If this was any closer to Downtown there would be millenials taking pics of their food at every corner.  I like this place a LOT.  Have to explore more of the menu.  I can't see that anything would be bad.  For takeout they need hot sauce packets.  Just like the hot mustard or soy packets, but hot sauce.  I know they exist.  I've seen 'em.  Not all of us white boys think ketchup is spicy..."}
{"text":"What a refreshing experience! Due to unique circumstances, we ended up visiting this restaurant and were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and service. This is a no-frills restaurant that specializes in Cantonese cooking, which focuses on making dishes to enhance the base ingredients (rather than drown it out).  Our server and the owner at the restaurant were very kind. New Wong's used to be located in Cleveland but moved due to the cost of the location. Since then, they've also expanded their menu to add more variety and options.  We had the steamed tilapia and mapo tofu (a spicy tofu dish). Wow- the steamed tilapia was as good as the ones I've had at NYC and Chicago. Very well prepped, for just the right amount of time, and great flavor. The mapo tofu was not the typical Sichuan flavor with spice and grease. It was less oily and had just enough spice to complement the taste of the tofu. I was also extremely impressed to see that it was entirely vegetarian, but still very flavorful.  If you are hesitant to visit because of the language barrier, they have pictures of dishes on their walls and the servers are very friendly and willing to help. Their English is good enough to guide you through the menu as needed.  Compared to the closer Cleveland establishments, New Wong's offers authentic cuisine without the extra grease at very reasonable prices. Wish it was closer to home, but we will certainly be coming back- it is worth the trip to satisfy cravings for authentic Chinese food!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Chinese food especially because it's in my neighborhood is even better so I don't need to venture to China town in Cleveland to get my Chinese food fix. Honestly, I feel like this restaurant just doesn't get the recognition it should. Being a daughter of a Chinese restaurant owner I always compare their food to others. This is the BEST Chinese restaurant in town!  And I mean that! Willoughby/Wickliffe is lucky to have an amazing Chinese spot. Sorry but out of all the Asian restaurants I've tried in the area they just can't compete! New Wongs offers authentic Asian food as well as your typical Americanized Chinese dishes. The place may look like a hole in the wall but it's really a diamond in the rough. Their service is great! The server is always smiling and friendly and the food always comes out quickly!   When my parents visited, even they approved of this place. We came for dinner and they loved it! The steamed tilapia was fresh!   If you have never had Real Chinese food I encourage you to venture out and order something other than fried rice or sesame chicken. Although their sesame chicken is good I can vouch for that. They have pictures posted up of some of their more authentic dishes on the walls of their dining area. And who knows you might find your new favorite dish!"}
{"text":"After reading all the Yelp reviews I am highly disappointed.  Portions are good, staff is friendly but food totally lacking in flavor... I mean none!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a big fan of this restaurant. I was their royal customer since they had business in China Town. Since they moved away from China town, I don't really have too many chances to go to Wickliffe. But if I have a chance, I will reserve my dinner time and go to New Wong.  The owner is the waitress. She is very tentative and nice. Very friendly and like to joke around. They have American Chinese food which I have never tried before so I can't give any words on it. They have a another menu is for authentic Chinese food. I love their cooking style. It's not over salty or oily. Everything is seasoned just in the right amount. I recommend \" deep fried salty pepper shrimp\", \"Jade toufu\", \"fry flounder fish\", \"Steamed Sliced Pork belly with Preserved Vegetables\" , \" Steam chicken with ginger sauce\"   I always feel so satisfied after walking out from New Wong. It's a comfort food for me. If you are a big Chinese food fan and willing to try authentic Chinese food, you should try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Since someone else took over restaurant 2 years ago, the quality of food declined. Had a take out twice and it is not the same anymore. Very sad indeed. Missed the old \"New Wong\"."}
{"text":"Great food!  Had sesame chicken. Crispy and sweet without being too sweet.  Also had the egg roll and hot and sour soup, which was decent. Friendly and fast service. Ambiance was ok.  Decently priced."}
{"text":"Fantastic gem! On our way through Cleveland to the East Coast and found this place on Yelp. Very authentic Cantonese cuisine. I'm traveling with my godmother who has lived in Chicago's Chinatown for 40 years and she also gave her thumbs up on this place! Really friendly owner. Would come back if I am back in the area! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"All I know is that I love the fish filet with vegetables. When I was sick and grumpy and my throat was so sore from a cold (that eating most things was like swallowing razor blades) this dish with added ginger was just awesome. Soft, velvety flakes of white fish steaming the aroma of ginger, garlic and celery, served with white rice. I ordered this three times within a week. Heavens me! Didn't feel an ounce of guilt bc it had a light coating of flour, lots of veggies, was savory, not sweet.. Three and a half stars for this dish... and an extra half star for offering an extensive menu in this part of town that includes Chinese American standard fare as well as touches of my fave exotics (wood ear mushrooms, xo sauce, a choice of seafood like steamed fish or clams in black bean sauce..) Looking forward to trying more.  Only thing that I noted was that they serve a not so delicate wonton app with a spicy pnut sauce that I didn't really like. If you are familiar with Schezuan/Sichuan fare, don't mistake this for the spicy wonton dish in chili oil, as it is not the same thing.  Actually, hm.. three and a half twinkling stars OVERALL is fair :) They saved me from driving all the way to Asia town for authentic Chinese, earning this place a notable pin spot on my map.  Now, if the universe would grant Willoughby a Pho restaurant... ;)"}
{"text":"Have ordered carry out here several times.  Great food.  Salted baked pork is great.  Great service.  Nice little restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a gem in Wickliffe!  I have tried many of their dishes, including hot and sour soup, egg rolls, szechuan broccoli, salt baked pork chop, cashew shrimp, and orange chicken.  They are generous with meat and portion sizes with high quality ingredients.  Love it!"}
{"text":"While I was in town from Chicago, I was itching for some Chinese delivery while posted up at my brother's comfortable, suburban abode. The only reason New Wong's loses a star is because when I called - there didn't seem to be a way to order anything online or through GrubHub - they stated that they were not delivering. After a short ride down Euclid Ave, we were able to acquire the goods; enough food for about 10 people, which was more than enough for the 3 of us. I have no complaints on the food quality or taste, and the owners were super nice although with the expected English capabilities for the establishment. I say go for it."}
{"text":"Nice little authentic Chinese restaurant. Now I don't have to drive to downtown Cleveland for some Jade tofu or chow fun. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Went out on a limb and ordered something new tonight....... Kung pao scallops. The picture on the website sold me! Unfortunately, what I received went right in the garbage. I'm not a fan of cooked celery or green pepper, and I hit the jackpot of my least favorite foods when I opened the take-out box. Still, I wanted to give this dish a chance so I dug around to get to the scallops. The breading was slimy! It was the strangest thing. Strange in a bad way.   Check out the website pic vs what I received. 14 bucks down the drain."}
