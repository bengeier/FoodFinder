{"text":"The BEST in the whole area! Seriously. I've actually been eating here since i was in 5th grade! This isn't going to be the best review...i haven't mastered this Yelping yet. I could exist on the food from here. They have all the favorites;lo-mein,fried rice,general tso's chicken,chow mein,seafood,beef,chicken dishes,something for EVERYONE. The prices are very reasonable too. For example,a won-ton soup and an egg roll (or spring roll) for $3.00. Family owned and operated too and who doesn't want to support that?"}
{"text":"The \"Amazing Chicken\" (which you can get as a lunch special Mon-Sat) actually lives up to its name. It's similar in concept to General Tso's but has thinner, smaller pieces of chicken with much less batter than is usual for a Tso's-type dish. Thus the ratio of chicken to batter is awesome. I also enjoy their Kung Pao, string bean, and broccoli dishes. Their egg rolls and spring rolls are wonderfully fresh and crispy in-house (they soften a little in the bag if you carry out). It's pricier than Number 1 but the food is much better."}
{"text":"Best chicken egg rolls ever. And fried rice is on point. Hot and sour soup is best in whole area. I've been eating here since I was a little girl. There food is always consistent and fresh. I do wish they would deliver though."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food I've had in years! I ordered takeout: the general tso chicken with fried rice and a spring roll..loved it! It wasn't your average kind of fried rice. Didn't take pictures though lol. First time visit and I'm probably going to become a regular. Won't give it 5 Stars because they only have individual servings for lunch and not evenings."}
{"text":"So good. Staff is very friendly. We dined in last Friday 4/14/17 & I got the General Tso tofu. This is the only place I've been to in the PH/Monroeville/Verona area that does this well. The outside is very crisp & the inside it tofu so its on the softer side. So many other places make it so soggy and the outside isnt crisp at all. This is by far have the best. I will be back and i will get the tofu again! I loveeeeeed it!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Sichuan Palace my whole life and it's delicious. They always give large portions and their food is very good. I recommend the sweet and sour chicken and the beef with vegetables. Their crab Rangoons are excellent too."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING !  this is my 3rd and FINAL review of this place, because I won't be ordering again. Please read my previous 2 reviews.  Tonights dinners were AWFUL. The worst, oddest fried rice I ever had.....even the texture and flavor of the rice was strange.....sort of gritty, clumpy, just totally disgusting and the vegetables were just as bad......tons of that little mini corn and then like 5 peas, a few pieces of diced carrots, 1 or 2 green things, the mushrooms looked rotted.....seriously, THE worst chinese food I ever had......anywhere......obviously, this place is not consistent. I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"After visiting Penn Dot myself and the other half were in need of sustenance and this was the closest. Walking in we were greeted by a hostess who showed us a booth right away. Our server was there within seconds and took our drink orders. On his return he also brought what looked like fried pieces of the stuff egg rolls are wrapped in. Ya I know, not the best description but I'm really not big on Chinese food. Also it must be said that if you order a soda you will pay by the can because they don't have fountain drinks. Now onto the food. I ordered sesame chicken. I was a bit apprehensive because I don't normally like chicken that has a breading and then is tossed in a sauce. The chicken itself was still crispy and tasted fresh. My only real complaint is that I found it lacking in sesame flavor. The sauce it was tossed in was very similar to the general tso the other half had. Mine just has sesame seeds thrown on top. I think my boy might have gotten the best dish. He had singapore style rice noodles. They were really good. Our server was nice and present but not pushy."}
{"text":"I live down the street and I love it there . Number one the food is amazing . Number two the employees are the best.

I seriously love their egg rolls! They are huge"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this establishment a lower rating than a single star. The service here is unbearable, our waitress had an attitude throughout our entire visit. The food literally tasted like horse sh*t- I WISH I was making an exaggeration. We did not receive the food we ordered but we still had to pay for it. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Was hoping for more based on the reviews. Went in to eat lunch and service wasn't great, atmosphere strange (very quiet, no music - could hear the coupe across the restaurant complaining about their food). Seems most of their business was takeout. The food we got was on par for takeout I guess, but by the end I felt so overloaded with salty and sugary sauce on everything. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I love this chinese spot. It's one of my favs in the whole pittsburgh area. Everything I've tried here has great taste and it's not too greasy. I've tried the General Tso's, Buddhist delight which is al veggies in a white sauce and their beef and broccoli.

Of course i can't forget the combination fried rice. It has pork, chicken, and shrimp not to mention the perfect combination of fried rice with all the great flavor. I have never had a problem with their dishes. Everything is served hot and fresh and never taste bad. I never have stomach issues either like some other restaurants.

The inside decorations are a little outdated and could use some freshening up but it doesn't take away from the quality of the food and the great service. The place is almost never occupied. I see a few couples there every now and then but most of the guest order take out.

Try whatever you like here I'm sure you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Major dissapointment- I called to order the lamb and scallops which I saw on their website an the guy said it was lamb and scallions so I got the sesame chicken.i get to the restaurant and low and behold lamb and scallops IS ON THE MENU! then Unlike many places where you get pieces of chicken this was strips of chicken in a sauce that was waaay too heavy. Give it a missand spend the extra 15mins to drive to Monroeville."}
{"text":"I've been to this place multiple times in the past year (since finding out about it) and I have to say this is probably the best Chinese Food in Pittsburgh. They don't have the extra oily taste that most Chinese food places have. And my food always taste fresh. The employees are great extremely friendly. I have always got take out never sat in the restaurant and ate. But there are multiple Chinese food places closer to my home but this is the only place I will go to."}
