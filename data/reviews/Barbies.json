{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the good quality of food, pleasant service and relaxed ambience. It's been many years since I ate at the original Barbie and I see how this local restaurant chain has evolved favourably over time. Recommended and I will be back."}
{"text":"Déjeuner ok,  rien de spécial.  Les Beans sont sucrées,  yak!  Les oeufs miroirs sont cuits à la perfection (chose extrêmement rare de nos jours)  Bravo.  Benedictines banal.  Café pas buvable.  Service correct.  On y reviendra...  Non.  On l'évitera...  Non plus."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times. They offer generous portions. It's a great place for game night or to spend time with family. They have a bar.. They also have a Terrasse during the summer. The food options is good but not the best. I wish they would include more vegetarian/vegan options in their menu. Overall, it's a good place to try. If you're on a budget, I suggest going there during their weekly specials."}
