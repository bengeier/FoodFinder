{"text":"Arguably one of the best pho restaurant in Montreal. Portion slightly smaller than other competitors for x-large size. Very quick service."}
{"text":"Clean wise borderline acceptable; the washroom could be cleaner and they could replace the old tables and chairs. The place is simply too small to go eat in groups but if you're looking to go in, (wait in line), eat and go out than the place is fine. I would say a group of maximum 4 people is OK since they only have 1 table for 8 people or so and the rest is for 4 or 2. The Pho is not the best Pho in town but the place sure is one of the most popular."}
{"text":"If you are looking for fast, delicious, well priced pho - this is the place to go! No bells no whistles, just great food. I call ahead for pick up because lines can be lengthy during peak dinner hours. But fun to sit and stay in too!"}
{"text":"pho life is real here, great service authentic food and solid, great times with friends and family, clutch for canada weather"}
{"text":"First time here. Great pho, fried spring rolls and fresh spring rolls. Small place, wait time can be about 10-15min but worth the wait"}
{"text":"My husband and I had our first ever Pho experience today at Pho Lien. We had read about it on Yelp and decided to give it a try.

We came right before the lunch rush around 11:45 and got a table beside the window. We really didn't know what to order but our server was nice enough to help us out. We ordered the imperial rolls to start. They came in less then 5 minutes and they were amazing! We couldn't quote figure out what was in them but it didn't matter! Then I got the chicken pho soup (can't remember the actual name) and my hubby got the beef soup. Again...we waited less then 10 minutes total. The soup was piping hot and the portions were HUGE! The flavours were so unique that at first I wasn't sure if I really liked it. I added some of their teriyaki sauce into it and the flavours just came of life! The more I ate...the more I wanted to eat! It was sooooo good!!! A totally new flavor profile then we've ever had!

The service and food were outstanding. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stats is because of the ambiance and hustle/bustle of the restaurant. Had I not read all the reviews on yelp, I would have never eaten there after walking into it. It's a bit of a dive restaurant...no decor and just a bunch of tables jammed in there. Plus as the restaurant started filling up...we felt a bit rushed. Our whole lunch was about 45 minutes long. So if you're looking for a nice place to sit back and lounge...I wouldn't go here. 

But overall...outstanding food for our first time! Thank you \"Yelpers\" for helping us find this little gem!"}
{"text":"This steamy bowl of Vietnamese comfort food hits the spot and I'm convinced it tastes better in the winter when the temperature outside if a bone chilling minus ridiculous degrees and just a word of warning... Like with Korean BBQ, the smell of pho will permeate your clothes and people on the bus will know exactly what it was you had for lunch. Don't get discouraged by the phoddicts lining up out the door, people move through the place like milking cattle, you won't wait more than 10 mins at the most."}
{"text":"One of if not the best pho in Montreal (was highly recommended by a friend who lived there for 7 years). Did not disappoint - service was prompt, atmosphere was lively during lunchtime, food was authentic, and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"The food tastes good, however for the quantity and price there are a lot better places on the same street. Forget going there in winter, unless you like being squeezed next to strangers and people that are still waiting in line for their seat.
Finally, this place is cash only."}
{"text":"This place is a Montreal landmark. The Pho is excellent and the deserts are delicious if you like tapioca. Its always busy and really small inside so you might have to wait but its good food. The noodles have changed IMHO and its not as good as 10 years ago but still worth it."}
{"text":"J'adooooore la soupe tonkinoise! Jamais déçue! Ça tient l'estomac et le coeur chaud! Et il faut absolument essayer leur Chè Ba Maú! Dessert/boisson fèves au lait de coco!"}
{"text":"Soup good 
Imperial rolls good not too oily 
Vermicelli good too
Not a big fan of Pho
But this restaurant is above average"}
{"text":"Up until now the best Vietnamese Pho I have had in Montreal. Not sure if I will change my mind if I try new ones."}
{"text":"This place is always busy, so I was very interested. I ordered a bowl of beef with vermicelli. It was very good! I love here. Come back again!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in Montreal. I don't bother with anything aside from the Pho since all their other dishes have better tasting versions or variations elsewhere in Montreal.

You may want to try ordering the meat on a side plate then dropping it in the steaming bowel of broth when it arrives as I heard it makes it more enjoyable.

Expect a short waiting line during lunch hours. Paid busy street parking. 10minute walk from the nearest metro station. Service is indifferent.

Always hits the spot. A bit overpriced for simple Pho as they were more reasonably priced a while back but hey..greed is king."}
{"text":"This place is pretty average.  Their pho is a good size and tastes alright.  Not the best, but not bad.  The vermicelli with grilled pork, which costs more than the extra large pho, was pretty small and did not fill me up at all. Although the grilled pork was quite good.  The Imperial rolls were a real disappointment. Mostly wrapper, with hardly any filling. Service was efficient, if not particularly friendly."}
{"text":"The best pho in montreal

I tried so many pho places around the town and yes it is the best.

The pho here is on the greasy side as in really thick soup and the smell will stick with you for the next 5 hours. The craving for it will be gone for about 2 weeks and it will come back right at you. So be ready"}
{"text":"Fast, delicious, and authentic.

They also made substitutions to my grilled chicken/salad/rice plate for more veggies instead of rice for no additional charge. 

Chinatown isn't the only option for no-frills asian food!"}
{"text":"Ca fait maintenant plus de 5 ans que j'y vais et c'est toujours aussi bon.
Toujours frais, le bouillon pas trop salé et bien équilibrée en saveur.
J'ai essayé plusieurs resto Viet a Montreal et celui ci se défend bien.
Une bonne option pour de la bouffe saine et sans chichi"}
{"text":"Very good Pho on Cote Des Neiges across from the Jewish General Hospital.

A bit too much MSG, but what is good Pho without some MSG? Had the rare beef Pho. Good amount if meat, took the small one since it was lunch time. Also eat a very good Imperial Rolls, nice and crispy and not overly oily either.

Restaurant is tiny, so a big group is difficult to accommodate.  Show up early or you'll end up waiting at the tiny door way.

The restaurant won't win any awards for decor with the cheapy chairs and tables, but it's clean."}
{"text":"Best pho place hands down! The only place I would go for pho and I've been to quite a few pho restaurants in my lifetime in many different cities and this is the best. Even tho I no longer live in mtl and live in the south shore, I still make the trip to pho lien. It's worth it! I don't care for their other dishes cause I've never tried. This is strictly about the pho."}
{"text":"Very decent quality pho in Montreal. Enjoyed the quality of the pho - clear well flavoured broth. Service could be friendlier and more attentive, but is as expected a this price point, so can't really complain. Cash only, so bring your paper!"}
{"text":"After seeing the reviews on Yelp I decided to try this place one evening and was not disappointed.  Since then I order take out at least once per week.  Even though it is  common to see a line at the door (and sometime outside) it never takes more than 10 minutes for my food to be prepared. I usually get lemon grass chicken or beef (creature of habit) that is as good as any that I have had anywhere else.  The gentlemen at the counter is always pleasant and appears happy to see me once again."}
{"text":"Excellent pho, green papaya salad, and fried banana."}
{"text":"1st, this place is always packed and it does not close during the day.

Most people go there for the pho and it's excellent.  Great selection.

Place is ran by Vietnamese.  The speak excellent french and english."}
{"text":"After intense session of pingpong and leg workout, I was craving for Pho. 
I heard about the famous Pho Lien and had to give it a try.
I went for the original one. It tasted great. I didn't go crazy lol. It was a great Pho. 
I also tried the iced coffee which was nice. 
The place is really small and crowded. You don't have much intimacy. 
Great for a quick warm pho."}
{"text":"Best pho in Montreal. I've tried several other places but this is the winner. Ordered pho and the soup was amazing, very light and tasteful! I go back every time that I can.  Good service, very efficient. Summer rolls are good as well. If you are not a fan of soup, then there are other rice/noodle dishes that are delicious.

GIVE THIS A TRY! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Really impressive soup. The beef was so soft and yummy. As a tourist, I'll visit this pho place again when I come to Montreal"}
{"text":"Dishonest people. Won't except credit card. We did not have any Canadian cash. We asked him how much was the bill. He gave us a total. We trusted that he was honest. After we came back to the hotel, we learned he cheated us on the currency conversion by $20. Really?"}
{"text":"The place was as crowded as usual. After having waited for 15minutes we were lead to a table which was very near to the toilettes, like 2meters away, and there was water on the floor, that made me really uncomfortable. We waited for an another 10minutes to change a table.

The pho was tasty though, but it wasn't the best one I tried in montreal. Soupe of the noodle was a little bit sweet, but I was amazed by the abundant amount of beef in the bowl. Liked the drink with red beans, coconut milk and other ingredients.

And don't forget to bring enough cash because they don't accept any card. To withdraw cash, you gotta get them at the mini ATM which will charge additionally $1.5...

Even though it isn't flawless, but it is still a very popular and comparatively worth going restaurant in the cote des neiges area."}
{"text":"L'endroit est peu intime et bruyant, mais la soupe est excellente."}
{"text":"Has to be the best spot in Montreal for Vietnamese soup. The spices are perfect. It can get crowded inside."}
{"text":"Overpriced compared to what I am used to.. Toronto Hamilton prices and size... Flavor was pretty good for pho.. Curry was weak portion tiny even the rice was tiny.. Rice was soggy as well. Place was packed I guess this the norm in mtl"}
{"text":"Perhaps they have the best Pho in Montreal. The broth is absolutely delicious.

The spring rolls are very tasty and fresh as well. 

Don't forget to have cash on you."}
{"text":"I spend far too much time at this restaurant! The soups are amazing - and although the place is always busy, the service is great. My friend has the soups with the tendons etc (and loves it), but the rare beef is amazing. Even their desserts are nice. Nothing pretentious- just delicious pho lien."}
{"text":"The English spoken there wasn't very good, which caused me to not get what I want. 

The food was ok, but definitely not the best rice vermicelli. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Ordered a regular (aka small) sized bowl of well done beef brisket, beef tendon, and beef tripe noodle in soup! Admittedly I didn't have high expectations but I was pleasantly surprised to find the soup light and flavourful and the staff to be incredibly kind. My only complaint is that the noodles aren't fresh noodles but that's because I'm picky, you could barely taste a difference. 

The cost came to a total of $7.05 (without tips) and though I have gotten larger portions of pho from other restaurants for the same price, I wouldn't be against stopping by if I was hungry and in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Probably the best pho in town. Been around for ages and still going strong. Perfect for a fast lunch during a cold winter day. A must try if youre in the area. Be prepared to wait in line a bit."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! Its a small place with big flavors! If your craving a satisfying asian noodle soup than this is one of the best places in montreal for it!! Service is also quick !"}
{"text":"Really good pho, although they don't have the spicy soup. The meat is tender and the portions are large, only thing is that service was really mediocre, probably because there are just too many customers and not enough waiters. Anyhow two-thumbs up!"}
{"text":"What can I say other than: the best Pho in town. Yep, their broth is on fleek (haha inside joke). But yeah, the Pho is incredible and definitely worth traveling for. 

They also have deliciously fresh spring rolls, that melt in your mouth and seem to be the perfect pairing with Pho imo. 

As opposed to the other Pho places, I have to admit, I've never tried anything else on their menu - not sure if it's because it didn't seem appealing or if it's because the Pho is so damn good I didn't notice anything else. Either way, come and have the Pho!"}
{"text":"Tried so many pho spots and this one is the best. The broth is so tasty and the service is very fast. Friendly staff and the prices are pretty cheap compared to other pho places that are overpriced and not so good. Sometimes you have to wait in line but its really worth it. The food is also really good!"}
{"text":"I was at pho lien last night after reading the reviews from yelp. It's a little disappointed. I have the grilled pork chop over rice and my husband has the beef noodle. The food was average and portion was small compare to pho Tay ho which has a much flavorful broth. Will I return? Probably not."}
{"text":"Tried out Pho Lien on Côte-des-neiges, as the reviews online were pretty high. Although Alex really liked it, I wasn't a huge fan of the broth. I prefer a sweeter broth. So to me, the pho was good, but there was a little something missing in their pho broth. 

For my full MTL Pho Hunt review and more photos, check out my blog: Turquoise Blog (link in bio!)"}
{"text":"I've tried many other pho places and this one is the best by far. Amazing taste and price. Always fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Always come.. never regret. The soups are the best! The price and service are the best!
Try it out!"}
{"text":"Pho Lien is the place to go if you have a cold or just want to have the best pho in the city. I strongly recomment a grilled chicken pho for 10$. As an appetizer i would go for the springrolls or their famous bo ching (rice pati with eggs and soy sauce) It's very yummy."}
{"text":"Food is great but I deduct one stars for not having any other form of payment, especially when the restaurant is quite successful. Instead, they conveniently put an ATM and let us pay a few dollars for the cash withdrawal. 

Just raise the prices and add all payment forms. I find this a lame business tactic on their part."}
{"text":"Il faut y aller le midi, et commander l'assiette de boeuf grillé, servi avec riz et salade et un rouleau impérial, le tout pour la modique somme de 12$. Arrosez le tout de leur petite sauce magique, et vous aurez une explosion de saveur en bouche. En entrée, la petite soupe qui est incluse possède un bouillon parfumée à merveille. 

En dessert, laissez tomber vos préjugés et essayez le populaire Chè Ba Màu, qui consiste à un étagé de fèves rouges, fèves jaunes et tapioca vert fluo, servi dans un verre à eau, le tout recouvert de lait de coco. Un pur délice !"}
{"text":"I$10 for bun is a bit steep for the area and the spring rolls were very strange. However last time we came the chicken was very old, the pho came out lukewarm and the owner obviously did not care about his food quality or customers."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite pho places in montreal. My friend and I came here after work since we heard a lot of good things about this restaurant. We ended up ordering a large beef tripe pho and shared it because it was an awkward time to eat dinner for us (5pm). 

The food was really good - best I've tried in Montreal. Taste was authentic, they give you so much sprouts, basil, etc which is great because I've been to places where they have been...stingy on that. A large was definitely the perfect size - I was extremely full by the time we were finished. My friend also seemed to really like the place too. We're probably going back soon haha.

The service was okay. What I didn't really enjoy here was probably the floors. It was very sticky and humid where we were sitting. I'm not sure if there was probably a spill or we were just in a bad corner, but I would be a bit weary on picking my choice of sitting space next time."}
{"text":"So the consensus is that Pho Lien is one of the best, if not THE best pho place in Montreal. It's my personal favourite and I frequently make the pilgimmage from downtown to Cote des Neiges to get my fix.

Here are three things to keep in mind about Pho Lien:

a) Always remember that it's closed on Tuesdays. There really is nothing worse than getting shut down when trying to satisfy a craving (or appease your addiction).

b) Cash only! Although they have one of those money-grubbing private ATM machines in-house if you're really in a bind.

c) Keep in mind that unless you eat outside on the terrasse, you are going to stink to high heaven when you leave this place. I'm not saying the place stinks, cause oddly enough, it doesn't. Just don't wear your good clothes here, and certainly don't expect to go on a blind date or an important meeting immediately after eating here and still expect to make a good impression. I had to have my winter jacket dry cleaned after coming here because my coworkers kept sniffing the air and wondering \"what's that smell?\". Real talk.

Oh, and try the rice pancake with egg!"}
{"text":"One waiter who served us probably was an owner and was absolutely not customer service oriented and was almost rude to us. Not sure about foods either."}
{"text":"Best pho I have ever tasted. I have never been dissapointed by what I ordered. The rolls, the pho and the rice with beef are all delicious. The only downside is the crowded space, but that isn't much of an issue if you dont go on busy hours like from 12h-1h30."}
{"text":"Mon endroit favori pour une soupe pho! J'adore les soupes, et celle là est tellement satisfaisante et savoureuse qu'elle fait mon bonheur! Les légumes sont croquants, le bouillon juste assez relevé et les nouilles ont une texture parfaite. Je prends toujours la soupe végétarienne. Le format \"petit\" est énorme, faut faire attention! Souvent, je prends aussi des rouleaux de printemps. C'est frais, et la sauce piquante aux arachides qui les accompagne est délicieuse. Je n'ai toujours pas eu le courage d'essayer leur fameux dessert cha... Un jour, un jour! Dommage qu'ils acceptent le cash seulement... Il y a un ATM sur place si je me rappelle bien, mais ça coûte 3$ pour tirer de l'argent..."}
{"text":"Used to be my favourite spot for years. I was disappointed when I visited them a few months back. Their soup is filled of MSG, the portions are small. Their combo with rice is not as tasty as it used to be. Service def needs to be improved. Hate the fact that they only accept cash! Won't be going back anymore."}
{"text":"Not bad, Montreal. Not bad.

Surely not the best bowl of pho I've ever had but since I'm from Toronto, the pho here definitely hit the spot. 

A hot savoury bowl of broth filled with soft rice noodles and sliced beef, topped with scallions and bean sprouts. Mmm, what else would you want on a cold day?"}
{"text":"Simply good quality and affordable Pho, these guys do it right. Delicious spring roles and the bean-coconut milk beverage is really refreshing."}
{"text":"A well run pho restaurant. Quality is good. Service is efficient and courteous."}
{"text":"One of the best pho I've ever had! Flavorful broth that wasn't too sweet or salty...it was perfect! The meat was tender and so were the tripe and tendon. Place was packed but we were seated right away. Highly recommend this place! Good prices and you have the option of small, large or xl."}
{"text":"This is a great little place to eat. I had their wonton soup, and the broth was very flavorful. I also had the grilled pork chop and grilled chicken on white rice. The meat was very tasty as well. Cheap prices and friendly service."}
{"text":"Literally best Pho i've ever ever ever tasted. I go there since more than 10 years, nothing have changed (and i'm grateful for it!). Nowhere and nothing can beat this place!"}
{"text":"This very diverse neighborhood on the western slope of Mont Royal is loaded with a United Nations of  shops and restaurants. Feeling homesick for any home cooking on the planet?  You can probably find a reasonably good facsimile of your desired taste somewhere along Cote des Neiges or its side streets.  

We came for Pho, and that was what we devoured in noisy slurps at Pho Lien. This fairly small joint has a front outside dining area which always seems full in good weather, while it is easier to find a table within.  The staff is super efficient and friendly in French, English and Vietnamese.  

The Pho Ga (Chicken Pho) comes in three sizes, the smallest of which is likely to be enough for all but the biggest eaters, especially if you start with the Spring Rolls or other delectable apps.  The broth is the clear variety with a full bodied flavor.  The noodles are rectangular linguini-like, firm and tasty.  The side plate of accessories-sprout, basil leaves and lime wedges (no jalapeno slices), was full and fresh.  The sliced white meat chicken was plentiful.  A squirt of Stiraccha and the slurping commenced.  I know it is considered gauche to slurp when using the Asian flat bottomed spoon, but even when I try to be quiet, I can't do it. The overall taste is so compelling and succulent, that I just don't care.  

The Spring Rolls were pretty good, with nice size shrimp and a slice of grilled pork inside.  Perhaps, a half step down from the Pho-ntastic soup. 

The VN coffee with condensed milk was great, and a nice way to extend the afternoon as we took in the life on the street, and plotted our next move."}
{"text":"I was told this place had THE best pho in town, but I was skeptical. 
My favorite spot so far had been Pho Bang New York in Chinatown, so I was excited to see how Pho Lien would fare. We went there around 7h30 Friday night. It was cold, windy and raining, and the walk from metro Côte-Sainte-Catherine to Côte-des-Neiges seemed like an eternity. The place looked terribly busy, with its cramped tables, noisy patrons, and steamy windows. Thanksfully, out friends had saved us a table, so we sat down right away. 

We all ordered #1, which is the usual bowl of pho with beef and tripes, along with chè ba màu (three color... pudding? dessert? drink?). My boyfriend grabbed bun ga nuong (rice vermicelli + grilled chicken), emperial rolls and cafe sua dan (vietnamese coffee) instead. The drinks came first, followed by the emperial rolls and the main dishes. The food was delicious - so much that there's not much to say about it. The broth was rich, flavorful and not too oily or salty. The beef was tender and slightly fatty, and melted in mouth. It is the best pho in town? From what I've seen so far, it might just be! The chè ba màu is a must try if you like coconut. It's not very sweet, and all flavors tasted natural. I can't wait to have it again this summer! The cafe sua dan was also very well balanced. The coffee was quite strong, and perfectly diluted by the condensed millk and ice. The emperial rolls were the only things that were kind of meh. They were a bit too dry and not very interesting overall.

Prices are not the cheapest in the pho category, but are still very reasonable. Especially given how satisfying the meal was. I might just sneak onto bus 165 for a lunchtime visit one of these days!

Note: Internet stopped working on my cellphone inside the restaurant?"}
{"text":"Great food with nice, fast service. Really cheap too - it's only about 10$ per person if you only get a bowl of pho.

It might not be the greatest place to go to during busy hours, though - the place is really small and was packed when we went on a Friday night. Overall, very recommended."}
{"text":"Best pho in Montreal. My OG spot. Use to come here with my parents when I was a kid. Had hundreds of lunches here while in university. You know what to expect when you come here. Spring rolls are also delicious. They have grilled meats and different plates if you're not into soup, but this place has some of the tastiest in town. I highly recommend, good people, good food, this is an institution."}
{"text":"Best pho soup in Montreal. Been there so many times and never disappoints.
Love their dessert (Che Ba Mau) 
CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"I admit that I have been eating their food far too much lately, it's so convenient when I'm in the area at least a couple times a week. I've had their rare beef pho a few times and their grilled chicken combo meal a few times as well. Their pho is hearty and the flavor of the both is well developed, without it being too salty. Their combo meals are a pretty good value and I'm always satisfied afterward. I really don't have a negative thing to say, they are fast - even for take out. The only reason I'm not rating this 5 stars is because they are cash only - this is a digital world and it's time to offer more options to clients."}
{"text":"Good service but the food is not so good. we order 2 rice menu and 1 pho. All of us agreed that the food is not as good as the one we tried in vancouver, bc."}
{"text":"PROS:
1. DELICIOUS food. I especially enjoyed their Pho and Condensed milk/Iced Coffee- So gooood! 
Other items I tried were all really good too and the vegetables used are all fresh. 

2. Servers mean business! They're quick, efficient, and accurate.

3. Haven't been able to find a place with better pho than here. 

CONS:
1. Perhaps not the swankiest place in town, but the food makes up for it. I would rather go here than The Keg... just sayin'!

OVERALL:

-Worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"Good staple place for pho & snacks. Always very crowded. Service is ok. I took off some stars because the last time I was there I found a few thick short hairs (not my hairs) on my napkin and chopstick. Other than that, it was good and I'll probably go back."}
{"text":"Oh Montreal... if this is one of your best pho places we feel for you. 
Would have expected way better given the French connection and Vietnam.  We thought that this being close to University of Montreal would make it a good cheap eats.  It didn't really score on either account.  Maybe it was an off day but seems like there were a number of Yelpers with wildly different opinions so it may be the luck of the draw.
For us, the Pho was average at best.  The broth was weak and heavily msg'ed.  The beef was lacking flavour and seemed to be a cheaper cut of meat.   The tripe was a bit chewy. The pork chop with vermicelli was sub-par and veggies with it looked a bit raged.
Hopefully there are better Vietnamese restaurants in Montreal.  Probably one of the more forgettable dining experiences on our trip.
Yelp and Google are getting so frustrating to determine if you are getting the straight goods or not on the ratings.  This is definitely not a 4 starfor when we attended."}
{"text":"My friend told me about this small vietnamese gem.  The food and quality is amazing.   I like the #1 pho. It's soo tasty good.  And I absolutely love the their dessert :)"}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  Even though it's always full, there's always an open table.  It's a quick in and out and the service is friendly.  The price is very reasonable.  Parking is on the street, and we've always found a right out front parking spot."}
{"text":"Delicious pho soup and spring rolls. Fast and efficient service. First time coming here and i will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always packed with people. The price was good for its portion. The restaurant only accepts cash. This place is a nice spot to have a comforting meal on a busy day after school. However, if you want eat comfortably, they have limited space and the table is a bit greasy."}
{"text":"We arrived here on a Sunday evening and were pleasantly surprised to see the crowd at Pho Lien.  The restuarant had tons of patrons sitting in cramped quarters and all ordering the Pho.  Coming from California, I can admit I know good Pho when I see it and the bowls being served up at Pho Lien is pretty good.  They were unable to do any special orders on the Pho, but it came out quickly and hit the spot.  Also, we tried the fresh spring rolls and although it was a bit overpriced, it also was very delicious.  

Overall, this place truly deserves 3.5 stars.  =)"}
{"text":"We had dinner here when we were in Montreal a few weeks ago. Easy to find and ample street parking. We came kinda late for dinner, around 8ish and it was still pretty packed. 
Really good food and the price was very reasonable!! I'd def check this place out again next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Eat here during lunch time, so many people in line, the food here is very good, we ordered no 1 pho, with so much meat in it. good place for lunch."}
{"text":"Many locals say this place has the best pho in Montréal. Parking was easy because I was lucky. I was able to find a parking spot right out front of the restaurant, but be warned you might have to drive around a bit to find a parking space.  The place was busy, but luckily I was able to get the last available table.  They try to seat as much people as possible in this small restaurant. Hence the tables are real close together.  The menu was only written in French and English. I ordered their extra large pho dac biet (special beef noodle) and was not disappointed.  Their pho soup base was very tasty and you get quite a large assortment of meats on top.  The rare beef, though, was mostly well done when I received my bowl.  You also get a good portion of noodles in the pho. Would I come back?  Of course!"}
{"text":"Easily the best pho in Montreal- broth is excellent."}
{"text":"La qualité de la viande laisse à  désirer... Des brûlures de glaces sur la viande a fondu. Le bouillon manque de gout. Vous pouvez trouver  mieux pour du pho"}
{"text":"BEST PHO EVER!!! 
Yes the place is tiny; tables are right next to each other front, back and sides. 
Yes you can only pay with cash, no credit cards no debit cards at this place. 
Yes the service isn't super friendly. 
But the food is AMAZING! 
During our 3 days in Montreal we ate here twice! When I am traveling I never go to the same place twice no matter how good the place is. However since this place was SO GOOD my husband and his friend literally protested to go here again before our departure. 
Their spring rolls and Pho were really nice! :D Definitely going back for more soup & noodle!!"}
{"text":"this is my first Pho experience in Montreal.  Yum and inexpensive. ordered a small pho w beef, tripe, tendons and more tendons.  So good! Best of all, its Cheap eats!"}
{"text":"Finally was able to try this place! I've heard about it many years ago from friends and been meaning to go but just never found the time.  It's located right across from the Jewish General. It was around 7:30 on a Saturday night when I went and there was already a line. The restaurant isn't big so the tables are quite close together. I ordered the classic beef pho. The small bowl was more than enough and the ratio of meat versus noodles was fair. It was worth the visit especially if you're a pho fan. Just remember to bring cash!"}
{"text":"La nourriture est bonne, la fraicheur et le gout des epices sont presents. Le prix et les portions sont corrects. Service rapide et froid! C'est tout le temps plein de monde et c'est petit. Mais ca va le coup car c'est bon!"}
{"text":"Their Pho Dac Biet is just awesome! I moved here from Vancouver and was in constant search for a perfect pho that would be close to my favourite one, and finally found Pho Lien. The weird thing is that there's no medium size for your pho bowl, you have to get either small or large, but their pho is so good that dealing with the large portion won't be a problem."}
{"text":"One of the best pho places in Montreal. We always take the vegetable pho with shrimp even though it's not listed on the menu . The lemonade is excellent. The food comes fast, so if you're hungry ( although there's often a line) it's perfect. In the summer they have a terrace in the front which is great ."}
{"text":"Great food. The broth is not too salty and that allows the others flavors to pass through. Depending on the time you go, it can be fully packed and slightly loud or empty with the perfect ambience for good conversation!

Service is quick and the staff are super polite and helpful. 

I would suggest middle of the afternoon for the best quiet lunch. 

It is cash only but there is an ATM on location! The pricing are perfectly reasonable!"}
{"text":"This was recommended to me by a friend who said it was the best pho in Montreal. I ordered the rare beef pho and some minced pork spring rolls. Both were delicate and flavored just right. 

downsides:
It's small and cramped- you may get seated at a table in very close proximity to others and it is kind of a slog from the metro (uphill). Parking can be found on one of the side streets if you're driving and willing to walk a block or two. I think it is cash only so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"The pho was amazing - the broth was richer than any I have ever tasted - bursting with flavor. The service was great - we had a drink that was coconut milk, red beans and tapioca - sounds crazy but it was awesome.
Be aware though - CASH only :-)"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times; not because I found it to be the best Vietnamese place, but rather for convenience. I found their food to be hit and miss. I've only ordered pho or bun bo hue there. The first time I had their bun bo hue, I liked it; not so much the 2nd and 3rd time so I gave up on it.  As for their pho, there were days it was alright to good and there were days it was off.  There have been occasions where I just love the smell of pho as I stepped in, but am disappointed by the body of the broth itself. I feel they water it down and by how much depends on how busy they were expecting to be and how prepared they were for the rush.  

The last time I was there was for a weekday lunch with my cousin. The place was packed throughout the whole place and including their patio.  It was this time where I had experienced the blandest pho broth I have ever had. On top of it, my cousin ordered and 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef pho and the chicken was not fresh at all. You can taste that \"old refrigerated\" taste. This makes me question the freshness of their food.  On top of that, the chicken was shredded into fine pieces.  It will be a long while before I consider coming back here again."}
{"text":"My dear sweet Pho Lien 

I used to live on Decelles and Cote Ste Catherine so my bf and I wld order there aaall the time. Never disappointed, always had copious amounts, great flavor, quick takeout, nice people. Quality food, soups, vermicelli noodles mmm...

They have upped the prices since I moved away from the area but still, it's worth the trip in special occasions."}
{"text":"Still I believe to be the best Vietnamese in Montreal.  Recently I went there on the weekend and it was stupid busy!  The servers don't even try to be nice.  They want to serve you and they want you out quick!  

I ordered the XL rare beef pho and it was damm off the chart good!  With tax and tip it was $12.  Where can you seriously go wrong with this?  Maybe too busy for you in the restaurant?  Maybe not your level of politeness?  I come here for the food and not much else!  

Enough said!  Try to find me a better Pho in the 514!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for more than 7 years. Their spring rolls and beef brisket are my favorite. Service is always quick. Previous management would always come up to my family and say hello. From what I remember they are now under new management and the new staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Pho Lien is the best Vietnamese Beef Noodle (Pho Bo) restaurant in Montreal. Don't take my word for it, that is from the Vietnamese locals who know food. 

The owner used to run a factory locally, but when those opportunities went to China for cheaper costs, he had to shut down the Factory and try something different. So he went and hired the best Pho cook he could find, employed him for a year, and learned how to make good Pho. 

It isn't to California standards, but here in Montreal, C'est Magnifique!"}
{"text":"This is the best pho I had in Montreal. I always get the classic number one. The meat was very tender; i really enjoyed the tendons. The small was also a good size for me. If you like really spicy stuff, they also have these tiny green chillies that you can eat with the pho."}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch and ordered a bowl of rare beef pho - their service is a bit slow even in an almost empty restaurant. The food is okay."}
{"text":"The broth is really good. It's probably one of the best in montreal. Sadly, the quality of their meat was well below average. The beef was starchy, dry and just tasted like really old frozen meat. I would not return due to the quality of their meat, the broth is delicious but it doesn't make up for their poor quality meat. 3 stars."}
{"text":"TLDR: Best pho in the city

The above says it all!
The small restaurant is always packed and with a line heading out the door, but it's all worth it for the flavorful clear broth and noodle bowl. I always go with my standard beef ball pho which puts a smile on my face. 

A must visit when in Montreal."}
{"text":"This is the #1 most popular Pho spot in town! I do enjoy the Pho here because of the broth. However, I find the meat here a bit cold, maybe it was because I ordered the soft tendons. Either way, I think the Pho here could be better if they paid a bit more attention to food preparation and details. 

The Pho comes in multiple sizes, I recommend the Medium size because that's what will most likely fill you up! Small one would be good for a snack.

Overall, nice Pho restaurant because I can't find a better one in Montreal but I think there is room for improvement on food quality.

Friendly reminder that it is cash only."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the Chè ba màu, as it's the only item I tried.  I will say that it was very tasty, and while I honestly couldn't tell you what was in it without some research, it left my tastebuds feeling great!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. Amazing tasty Pho. We tried the imperial rolls, spring rolls and well done beef Pho, and it was super good and fairly priced.

I'd been to Chinatown places before, namely NY Pho that I love, and this place lives up to or even exceeds it. 

Service is fast and it gets packed, but overall a lovely meal out."}
{"text":"I can't remember how many times I nom nom-ed at this place for their delicious Pho-od - and I don't even live in Montreal.

The flavor of their dishes is addicting - I cannot get enough of the food here, my craving for this place usually begins when I finish eating until the next time I step into the restaurant.

I'm usually here on the weekends and their Bun Bo Hue is to die for. The variety of beef tendons, shanks, stripes mixed with the perfect broth with chili oil. It's the ultimate comfort food with a hint of spiciness to stimulate the taste. The essence of the dish is all in the broth, the heavenly broth. Simply the best food anyone could ask for on a cold winter day.

I discovered their Bún Thit Bò Xào during a conference week in Montreal and came back 3 times for it. The stir fried beef is marinated perfectly, cooked to tenderness but still maintains its chewy texture and strength. The vermicelli, fresh and light, topped with fresh vegetables. Delicious, flavorful and nutritious.

I love love love this place, it's no wonder it's always packed, no matter what time of the day. The food and service is extremely efficient, you never have to wait hungry for long."}
{"text":"I went there as a recommendation from a friend who said this was the best pho in town. Lets say that my expectations were not met. The broth was thin, the pieces of meat were ok at best, even with the hoisin sauce. But hey, it's pretty above average so you won't be completely disappointed."}
{"text":"Great tasting pho! Knocked down points for the fact that they skimp on the meat A LOT. They also skimp on the basil. Otherwise, the pho broth is really good!"}
{"text":"OK, this is very simple - the best Pho in the city. All you need to know.

I have tried most well known places in the city and no one touches Pho Lien. Service is not 5 stars but the is clearly."}
{"text":"The place was packed when we got there...Portions came quite nifty so dont order a large if youre not too too hungry. We had Pho and the spring rolls. The rolls had basal in them but they were quite yummy, and I also enjoyed the pho. Overall great experience and will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Family run Cantonese Viet restaurant. very good broth and very fragrant noodles. There mango milkshake was pretty good as well. Service is a little slow as there is only one waiter, however he was very nice and enthusiastic about his job. Very good homey decor. Will come again."}
{"text":"This place has my vote for best Pho (Vietnamese soup) in Montreal. They have excellent Imperial Rolls and Spring Rolls. Try the iced coffee which is brewed right in your cup at your table while you eat your main meal.
*Closed on Tuesdays!*"}
{"text":"Full disclosure, this was the first time I tried Pho. It's actually embarrassing to admit since I consider myself quite the foodie. Because I have nothing to compare it to, it's possible that I just don't like Pho very much. We came here on a Sunday night around 9 and the place was pretty full...usually a good sign. We each ordered a different small bowl of Pho and spring rolls to share. The sauce the spring rolls came with was delicious and we enjoyed them. The pho came in a pretty big bowl with bean sprouts on the side. Put simply, I just didn't like it. The meat seemed low quality and the broth had a weird after taste. I was pretty disappointed. Service was fine. They only accept cash. I found the price a bit high for the quality."}
{"text":"Delicious place to go. Near my school university of Montreal. The size is enough for a big person also can order different rolls with great price. Except sometime you have to wait to get a table. The place is always crowd. You should not go to at high business hours."}
{"text":"Pho Lien is definitely a notch above every other restaurant specialized in Pho in Montreal. Their soup is excellent, particularly their broth, and the other dishes (pork on vermicelli, lemongrass beef) are also excellent. Their spring rolls contain both chicken and shrimp which is nice. The peanut butter sauce is especially good. My only complaint is that they only accept cash, which is always an inconvenience. The food is worth the hassle however."}
{"text":"Average food, above average price for portion, very small tables, too crowded during lunch, very noisy during lunch, cash-only payment. There are better Vietnamese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"My favourite Pho restaurant in Montreal. It tastes just like home. 
First of all, the broth is prefect. It is rich and flavourful. I tend to taste the broth before adding any extra sauces in. That is how you can taste the \" beefy\" in Pho .^.^. Then you can modify the broth as you like. I tend to  go extra spicy.  It helps for common cold by adding extra pepper. 

Second and sadly, the restaurant is too small and not clean at all. Avoid  using their washroom. And sometime you have to sit on the special table that only few feet away from the washroom. And that is not really what you want. 
And, if you going during the lunch or dinner time, it will be a long waiting line. But it worth it .^.^."}
{"text":"This place holds the superior spot of pho in the city. I live downtown and I still only eat pho here. My favorite is number 4 with the brisket and raw beef also I suggest both rolls the fried and the Thai spring roll. 

Yes it smells like a sock
Yes it is only soup with weird beef parts and noodles
And yes it will change your life forever!"}
{"text":"Forget about Chinatown if you're looking for good, authentic TASTY pho, Pho Lien is the best place in Montreal for this Vietnamese comfort soup, but don't take my word for it. Just ask any of your friends in the Vietnamese community and they will tell you the exact same thing.

It's a bit on the small side, they only take cash and if you can, try to go during it's off-hours since there is usually a line up here. Service is very fast, prices are super cheap. The food is also very fresh and very tasty. A large Pho soup will fill you up for the whole day, no joke. I also found their spring rolls to be outstanding. 

Their pho soup is like the nectar of the gods especially on super cold and windy January days!"}
{"text":"Pho here is really good, I rarely drink the broth when eating pho at a restaurant, but the broth is so good at Pho Lien that I always gulp it down. I always go for the pho dac biet, I really think it is the best since there is plenty of meat (it is possible to ask for extra meat for some extra dollars). The Che Ba Mau is also really good, not frozen at all like some places where I have been before. 
Only problem with this place is that it is always crowded, especially during lunch (expect at least 10-15 minutes of wait), but the wait is worth it, especially during cold winter days."}
{"text":"Good food. Restaurant is clean. Good service. We tried their special and it was delicious. We also ordered some spring roll with peanut sauce. It taste good as well. Price is a bit high compared to other restaurants but that's probably because of the location. We'll come back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"2 and half star

Definetly not the best pho in mtl. Overhyped by people.

Soup is filled with msg and size is not big compare to other pho places. The quality of the meat is also not the best qulity.

Other phos that are better:Pho thanh,pho mymy,Pho bang nyc,pho hoai huong,pho nguyen."}
{"text":"Dropped into Pho Lien for a late afternoon quick bite with mom:

A couple of obsrvations:

   *  Location: Right at corners of Cote de Neiges & Cote Ste Catherine by Montreal Jewish Hospital

   *  Food: based on pho alone, I'd give 3/5 stars, nothing special, your typical pho. Taste a bit on the bland side, especially in late afternoon, the broth might have been diluted (evening pot still in the works)

   *  Service: none to speak of, waiting staff not friendly

   \" WiFi: not available, WHAT???"}
{"text":"We passed this place while walking by several times over the last couple days. We knew we should eat there because there was always a line out the door and we were not disappointed. We spent $60 for 4 adults. Everything we ate was fantastic although I would never remember the long Vietnamese names of them. The service was amazingly fast."}
{"text":"I love noodles. Thankfully I was able to get my Pho fix in Montreal. It is really hard to find good pho places in Miami, truthfully I have yet to find any good pho places at all In Miami which really sucks. There broth was sooooooooo good. Locals love Pho Lien and they consider it one of the best. I was skeptical but after we left we drove a block down I saw another Pho place which was empty. Pho lien is a small place but gets packed. I had the large bowl #9.  It was one of the best pho i've ever eaten. I wish i went back again before leaving Montreal since I can't get the same quality in Miami. Oh well, It just means I have to keep going back to Montreal, and that is definitely fine by me."}
{"text":"After I read about this restaurant on yelp we went there. We tried the Pho soup with chicks and beef. Both are very good, but the chicken one was better. The waiter was helpful and kind, we got our dishes fast, the prices are good. The only problem is the place is really tiny, lot of table in a small area, it wasn't so comfortable."}
{"text":"My opinion of this place is a bit divided.  We were at Pho Lien for lunch on a weekend and the place was packed.  The restaurant was small but cozy and the service was lightening fast.  We order Pho and vermicelli bowl and I think from the moment we ordered to the food arriving at the table it took about 5min... (probably indicating that the food was all prepared at the back, which is fine for a cheap restaurant on a busy lunch hour) . The Pho broth was way to salty and there was a hair in the vermicelli bowl... Not my best experience at a Vietnamese place.  I would not go back there.

Not recommended."}
{"text":"What a delectable meal! I never had pho before but my friend said she'd bring me to the best pho place in Mtl. I was not dissapointed. It was so flavourful! Filling and inexpensive."}
{"text":"This place is ok - fairly run-of-the mill Vietnamese in both offerings and quality. My friend liked it much more than I did. I prefer Pho Bang NY by a large margin. This place is far quieter though (if you prefer that). Very different geographic location so optimizing between one place or the other probably isn't worth it. Just go w convenience."}
{"text":"We r visiting Montreal and craving for pho, we went to Pho Lien ordered pho, com, bun, coffee. The pho broth is good but all the orders we ordered is under portion, iced coffee is a slap in the face (2 sips), service is terrible (feel like they don't need customers) wait staffs don't know their menu!!!"}
{"text":"This place has been a the only reason why i would come to this area. I believe that the first time i came here i was about 10 years old. I am way older now lol! The food is still delicious and i must say the service has improved tremendously! I live the owner! We all call her auntie. The pho is obviously the main attraction but as the bot chien and the bun bo hue. Let's not forget about the three colour dessert here. It's so well balanced. Not too sweet. The only problem that i see here is the parking. If you don't come early enough, it is kind of hard to park. In the summer time, they open up a terrace and you can enjoy your food under the sun which is quite pleasant."}
