{"text":"Ordered fish and chips, got deep fried fish jerky. Very thin filets deep fried too long. Really surprised a place would even serve such a thing."}
{"text":"Love this place I come for breakfast all the time and the food comes out fast. Definitely a bang for your buck and very cheap menu ! I recommend to anyone that loves a mom and pop restaurant"}
{"text":"Awesome food at a great price. I hope the owner makes it, there have been several over the years in this location but just can't make it last. Too bad, Lorain needs some stability. 

Go for the perch meal (it's Lorain, this is a necessity here), the filet sizes are better than average and a super great price."}
{"text":"They are incapable of making over medium eggs.  You order over medium you get over easy.  I see raw egg white and yoke and I lose my appetite.  I have ordered them hundreds of times and maybe twice they were right.  The owner saw my review on Facebook and basically argued with me about it.  Said nobody ever complains.  Well I've been in the restaurant many times when things were sent back.  Said I should tell the waitress.  I always tell the waitress and when they see I haven't eaten them they ask, they aren't cooked enough?  and I show them the runny white.  I usually get a discount because of it.  The owner is hardly ever there so she doesn't know what goes on day in and day out.  I don't want to take my eggs home to the dogs I want to eat them but I've tried so many times to get them right and have just given up; it's hit or miss.  As a consequence I don't go there much anymore.  I love breakfast and now just cook it at home where I can get an over medium egg every time.  The food is really cheap and the quantity is good.  They do use really cheap quality greasy sausage but the bacon is really good (can't eat it due to high blood pressure).  Their brown gravy they put on hash browns is to die for.  Their iced tea is a mix and tastes terrible not fresh brewed but their hot tea is great (fresh brewed).  They have an all you can eat fish dinner I think that's like fried Pollock and it's wonderful."}
{"text":"Was in town for a trip and wanted to try a new place. I ordered the steak and eggs with homefrys.
homefrys where a bit over cooked as well as lacking flavor. The steak I had I 
asked for med rare and was cooked prefect the cut of meat however lacked quality it was thick but a bit tough and stringy. Eggs I ordered over easy came out perfect as well. This is a nice layed back diner nothing flashy with a friendly staff that were quick to respond to anything I needed. I would go back again however with Chris's diner down the street this would be my second choice to that."}
