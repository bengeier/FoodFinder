{"text":"This could not have been a better lunch! Sangria was perfect for the weather, the dolmades were stunning and the Salmon was the best I've had in a very, very long time. I absolutely recomend this place."}
{"text":"The waitress didn't write our order down and ended up messing everything up. We were five and no one got what they actually ordered. Someone had an almost raw hamburger so asked to have it well done and it took 20 minutes for it to come back and it came back medium rare. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious Greek food on a beautiful patio! What more can one ask for? Yannis, our waiter, was not only friendly and accommodating but took the time to make us 3 custom designed cocktails.  An amazing find in the city, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Not what was promised. We ordered dolmadakia (rice wrapped in vine leaves) and we asked if it's fresh, we were told its home made, as well as home made tiropites and spanakopites, truth be told it was canned dolmadakia and the same Frozen spanakopites I buy from Costco. Big disappointment. At least tell me they're not home made, don't lie to me, I'm Greek!!! Not to mention in the food business. I came to support your place, and I was lied to in my face"}
{"text":"The worst restaurant on the planet. Made a reservation for New Year's Eve on opentable, went to the restaurant only to find that the restaurant was closed! What kind of restaurant is closed on NYE? Who leaves their open table open? How does a restaurant not recognize that there are reservations? This is absolutely unacceptable and the owners should be ashamed. I would give it negative stars if I could"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and food. Servers and staff are friendly. The restaurant hosts live performers from Greece. Overall the restaurant provides an authentic Greek cultural experience."}
{"text":"Arnaqueurs ils profitent de l'afflux de touristes et n'offrent pas un service d√©cent, bouffe correcte mais prix cher pour ce que c'est et vous font payer l'eau !"}
{"text":"The ambiance is gorgeous, and the singers/musicians are top quality. Service however was lacking. Went for a birthday dinner there last night and had very slow service. They said a bottle of house wine was $20. Then the bill said $35... when I asked why they said it was $20 for only the first 10 bottles. The lamb was fantastic, but when the pasta was ordered they brought out something completely different. After requesting the pasta originally ordered, they said they ran out and they came out with cold Moussaka. I don't think this restaurant is good bang for your buck. Very expensive for barely acceptable service."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant! If you like Greek food and Greek ambiance this the place to go! The owner is very nice and they have a live music! Food was very fresh!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've had. I took the pork souvlaki, with the Ceasar salad, which had a nice Greek touch with feta cheese and home made croutons with olive oil. The spicy feta dip and the pita are definitely an amazing starter. Will definitely come back with friends and family. Everything on the menu looks amazing. My friend took the salmon and the dolmades, which was also delicious. Very good pricing for the plates we got."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous time at Pireas on a Sunday night. We stumbled onto their lovely patio because le Champagnerie across the street had no outdoor seating. What a lucky find! Giannis the manager/owner was our server, and he was amazing. Fun, friendly, and recommended the single best bottle of wine we drank during a long weekend in Montreal. We shared a bunch of appetizers - spanakopita, the cold pikilia (a meze platter with various pita dipping sauce and dolmades), sausages and saganaki (flaming cheese cooked tableside). Everything was delicious. The patio in Old Montreal is spacious and has one of the best views/vibes of the city. The inside restaurant was also lovely, though we stayed on the patio for our visit. They also brought a cake with a sparkler after overhearing it was our friend's birthday. Lovely experience; highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a very authentic Greek Restaurant and the new manager is keeping it that way! I have been to Greece 3 times and  The Souvlaki, Mousskka, and Greek salad very fresh and delicious! The best was at the end of the meal when the Manager prepared the delicious Greek Coffee at our table then brought a huge piece of homemade Baklava that melted in our mouths! The ONLY downside is the weak beer list but he explained that they have a contract with Moulson so unfortunately the restaurant cannot bring in any Micro Beers from all the fabulous Local Breweries for 2 more years but don't let that stop you from having a deliciously authentic Greek meal here!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Pireas a few days ago with my father. The meals were made in large portions and the waiters were friendly. I had a few drinks such as a cosmopolitan. The drinks were a delight and the place had live music, which was great. my overall experience was positive and I would go back again."}
{"text":"Very bad service and i had the worst martini ever !!! I ask for a dirty martini and it tastes like orange and then the guy that is not a bartender try to make me one to replace it and gave me attitude!!! It was the so bad it burn my mouth"}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful. The staff is friendly. The chicken souvlaki is arguably the best in the city. They also have entertaining, live bouzouki on weekends.  My only criticism is directed towards Montreal construction. They have to hurry up on Saint-Paul E. Every day I walk down that street and just wonder how these businesses are managing."}
