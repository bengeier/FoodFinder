{"text":"the food is ok, the chicken is a bit more harder if that make any scence, the shrimp sause is thick and is not so good, they dont offer as much as other hibachi places and they cost the same. But they have really good sushi."}
{"text":"Great Sushi at a good price and its far enough away from Charlotte that theres not a crowd Fridays and Saturdays!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the service here.  The moment that we got inside there were employees eating at one of the hibachi table near the kitchen. I am allergic to shellfish and informed the waitress and ask them to cook it shrimp appetizers last.  When the chef came out the shrimp was on the same tray as the steak and chicken.  They cross contained all the steak and chicken with shrimp by not cooking it last.  While we were waiting on out food to be cooked the hostess had a bunch of their friends up there just chit chatting.  Near the end of our meal we noticed a hibachi chef in the back on his phone with his feet propped up on the others while on his cell phone.   When we told the waitress about my food allergy, she didn't take it seriously.  I could of died from the cross contamination of the shellfish. People should be more aware of the seriousness of food allergy.    We noticed that after the hibachi chef cleaned the grill it was still dirty. Notice the other hibachi grills had food still on them where there were no customer at them.  The waitress never even came back to check on his. Not even ONCE to refill out drinks.  This is our FIRST and LAST time going here unfortunately! There are a few far and between hibachi place here."}
{"text":"I never liked sushi until I found Takara! I can't make a comment on the hibachi but the sushi is delicious! If you don't like the raw or cold sushi you definitely want the White Christmas! The staff is amazing and knew me when I walked in the door after my first visit! After my second visit I didn't even have to order anything but my drink, she remembered my sushi order even though it had been a week! The best part is they have half price sushi rolls on Sunday and Wednesday! It's now a weekly event for me to meet friends or family for sushi!"}
{"text":"Hibachi - Chef was a rock star - food was good but way to salty to me. Felt the price to be high considering you get ALOT of rice with your meal and not enough of anything else.  Will try other options next time."}
{"text":"I was with a group of 4 and we were setted at a table with 4 ladies. The chef kept talking to the other party,  I am the one that the rice got thrown on. The rice was first. Then come the veggie's about 10 minutes later and then the meat about 15 minutes later. The rice and veggie's were cold by the time the meat got there. I had to keep asking for water. It was just a mess. Chef was trying to cook for 8 people and talk at the same time. Just didn't work. Never will I ever go there again."}
{"text":"Food was really good. I use Yelp often but don't usually comment. Today I felt compelled.  If you are gluten free like Katie, the world doesn't revolve around you.  Just bag your lunch so the rest of us don't have to listen to you cry."}
{"text":"Food is okay.  We've been several times and will go back.  I've been blessed to be able to eat at some of the top restaurants in the country including many sushi places and while I wouldn't count this strip mall spot among them, but we like it just fine.  Rolls and pieces are good.  A touch inconsistent but good.  We've not yet tried the Hibachi but from afar the chefs seem to be capable and entertaining which is key to a good Hibachi experience.  The service can be a little ftrustrating.  One night we waited about 10 minutes just to get our name in and it really wasn't that busy.  I'm not sure how experienced the crew at the front is but they seemed a little overwhelmed.  I would not recommend sitting at the sushi bar - when we did they kept piling dirty dishes onto the bar next to us. We've had one very good waitress that had a good sense of humor and others have been pretty short with us.    This place won't blow your hair back but it's worth a look if you're local.  Sundays and Wednesdays have specials such as 1/2 priced sushi pieces."}
{"text":"Wife's steak was underdone. She asked for Medium well, and her's was still bleeding. The lobster was over cooked. Was like rubber. Not going back ever. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"We eat here a few times a month, both in and take out. Mostly take out sushi on Sunday's, as they have 1/2 price rolls on those days. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Previously I gave this place a 4 star April 2015 however after a couple returns it's gone downhill. The lady who's up front is extremely rude and none personable. She doesn't acknowledge guess and is very short in her responses plus the food quality has gone down. The table people are still pretty good especially Peng.  We made reservations on today's visit for 7pm and had a 20 min wait with reservations. Just a couple weeks ago I brought my daughter to celebrate her drives license for lunch and the same evil lady was up front counting the money and not acknowledging guest. It was 11:05am and they opened for lunch at 11am and we were the first to arrive. After ignoring us for 10min she said \"she mopping\" referring to the woman mopping the floor \"it'll be 10 more min\". I had my mind set to LEAVE however my daughter wanted it so we stayed. Peng was our server so it made the stay worthwhile we spoke education, travel, culture and fun.  I was harassed via Yelp messages today (10-5-16) by the hostess who is extremely rude. She made ONE valid point stating that I shouldn't post a picture of her without her permission. I take that as a contradiction because I'm SURE if I posted her picture and stated something AWESOME about her she wouldn't have a problem but in good professional humane pose I am removing the photo of her however I have keeping the photo and I will save the screenshots of her three rude messages she sent me for management if they shall EVER inquire. I definitely will NEVER go here again and will be sure to let EVERYONE I KNOW & who follow me to NOT go here."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a long time and it's always been good. Tonight we ordered chicken hibachi and the chicken was not cooked all the way through. After you have had undercooked chicken it doesn't make you want to eat it anymore. The chef and the waitress apologized and they cooked new plates. Yes the food was fixed but no manager came around to apologize and no entrees were taken off the bill.  Not the way to treat customers."}
{"text":"Apparently they have changed management here.  It used to be excellent and now....not so much.  I can't speak to the hibachi side of the restaurant because I always just get sushi.  On my last visit the white tuna on the sashimi platter tasted extremely fishy.  I informed my waiter and asked him to tell the sushi chef that tuna was going bad and he replied that I should have ordered something different.  I eat sushi all the time and I have never had white tuna that was soooo fishy tasting.  My waiter disappeared after that and  members of management tried to justify the fishy fish..... I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Some great sushi to be had here, and the specials they have going on are amazing!  Hibachi lunch is cheap and fun to go to, and we try to come as often as we can.  Ask for Yang if you want top notch service!"}
{"text":"I ate at Takara for the first time tonight.  I ordered their steak and shrimp hibachi (~$18).  Portions were generous and the food was pretty good, though something about our teppanyaki chef not being Japanese detracted from the authenticity of the restaurant and my experience there overall.  Even though he was still very skilled, it was not the comprehensive Japanese experience I've come to expect.  At one point, our chef accidentally splashed boiling water very close to a customer.  I went on a Sunday night when apparently very few people make it here.  We were seated at one of only three active teppanyaki grills.  This particular restaurant was too casual for my liking, with a couple customers dressed in undershirts and another casually talking on his cell phone for half the meal.  I have had better."}
{"text":"Takara is decently priced, has decent portions, and decent service, but my overall impression was not that memorable.    I visited last night for a friend's birthday party.  The host was gracious enough, but the waiter was rigid and slightly curt when taking our orders.  I ordered Hibachi Chicken.  This entree was $14, which is typical.  The cook did not arrive until about 30 minutes after we ordered and did not dazzle us silly Americans with range of tricks that the other tables received from their chefs.  I was dismayed by the portions; smaller than what you find at Kabuto's and less veggies.  I'll chalk up the deficiencies in service to being brand new, but the Hibachi entrees could afford to be bigger.  This is an unpardonable sin in my book."}
{"text":"I come here once a year almost every year for a relative's birthday. For someone that lives way out in the 'burbs it's quite a value. Both that it saves the drive to Pineville or Southend for hibachi and for what they charge for what they offer.   It looks like any other Japanese hibachi place you've been in on the inside. The staff are always friendly and the food is good enough to come back every year. Do they serve the most amazing green tea? No, it's Bigelow but it's likely the only place to get green tea in Monroe.  How good the hibachi show is depends on the number of people around the table. It's still a restaurant and turning tables over is the name of the game. If you're lost or in the area and want some hibachi it's worth a stop. If you want the show, bring a group larger than 5 on a Tuesday or go on the weekend."}
{"text":"Made a reservation at 7:00, barely got sat by 8:00.... on a Wednesday. Ridiculously bad service."}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant just for sushi o ER the past year. I've never had their hibachi so I can't comment on that. The staff isn't the greatest but they suffice. I love their sushi, especially the salmon! They also have really good pricing on Kendall Jackson Chardonnay, which is my favorite. The sushi menu has a lot of different options. I'd also recommend their gyoza and seaweed salad."}
{"text":"I was treated with HORRIBLE customer service on March 8, 2016 by the manager Yan and 2 of her employees upon walkin thru the front door. I had called my order in 20 mins prior to picking it up and when I arrived to pick it up, I was never greeted or acknowledged, as a matter of fact I had to LOUDLY clear my throat in order to break up the\"foreign\" conversation they were all having in their language in order for them to snap out of whatever it was they were discussing. The manager finally turned around and offered to help and I gave her my name and order, I  paid for my order and they immediately went back to their conversation and I took a seat while waitin for my order to come out.. I saw 2 bags on the back counter behind the register and I thought it could be mine but the manager never thought to check until a little white american girl walks up to help the next customer who had also walked in after me and who also had a call in order. After she was handed one of the bags on the back counter, she looked at the other bag and asked her manager had she called the customer to let them know their order was ready...well needless to say, the american girl proceeds to read the ticket and lo and behold....That was my order sittin there, ready and by this time, ICE COLD! Because  I had been sittin there 10 mins after I paid the manager for my order and by the time they realized I had been there the whole time, all they could do was look at each other and speak in tongues and the look of STUPID on their faces was PRICELESS!!$....all I did was ask for my money back and she gave it to me but NEVER ONCE APOLOGIZED!!...with having said all of that, I say Yan,  you are a HORRIBLE MANAGER and you set a terrible example to your staff when u stand and engage in what seem like breakroom conversation at the register in front of customers without even acknowledging the fact that not only do we not understand your language, we really dont wanna hear all of that jargon and strange sounding laughter especially when we are HUNGRY and feel that we are being ignored!"}
{"text":"Two words: Godzilla roll. Amazingly fine sushi in a strip mall and in Monroe. I recently moved back to NC from the San Francisco Bay Area. I was extremely skeptical and a bit afraid of eating sushi in my provincial old hometown. WRONG. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and wonderful customer service! We will be here more often and the $1.99 kids meal on Sunday's definitely helps. The environment is very family friendly. Everyone enjoyed their meals and the hibachi chef was so nice and performed some really cool tricks for the kids. I tried the salmon for the first time and it was AMAZING!!! If you've never been check them out and if you have come again!"}
{"text":"We went here for my parents 48th wedding anniversary, we have been here before but not in a while. The greeting at the door was like stale bread how many and it will be 15-20 minutes. 35 minutes later we got seated this was on a Tuesday night and there were 2 other tables already being waited on but by no means was it busy. We got to our seats and the very overwhelmed and again not very customer friendly waiter took our drink orders there were 6 of us at the table it took forever to get our drinks. I got unsweet tea and was told AFTER I received it they were out of sweetener. So when I asked to switch to diet Pepsi he was very frustrated. We ordered our dinner and now another 5 people joined the table which then just threw the waiter into a tail spin. After we ate our appetizer, salad & soup we had to ask him to take away all the empty plates. The cook came out and checked to make sure he had all the right orders and to see how we wanted our steak and then he began to cook this was the most boring show I have ever seen. He did egg roll and the onion volcano which he let burn for so short amount of time if you blinked you would've miss it. He did no knife tricks no cooking tricks other than the egg roll he didn't talk to us or try to entertain us at all. He just cooked and put it on the plate. I had to ask for shrimp sauce and he skipped my dad on the 2 shrimp you are supposed to get. The up side is the food was good, it's not the best I've ever had but it was favourable. We spent $100 for no show, mediocre service, and good not great food. I can assure you I won't be back for a while. They need to get it together!"}
{"text":"Sushi was best I've had here in North Carolina. Take out was right on time. Very pleasant atmosphere while waiting. Definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place used to be my go to spot not anymore. Food quality and quantity have gone down. Dont order soup for take out it will spill all over the place. The last 3 times i have eaten here the portions have gotten smaller and the flavor is not the same."}
{"text":"I would not return to this restaurant.  I was greeted by a member of the wait staff body-slamming me on his way to get a menu, and no he did not say 'sorry' or excuse me.  The waitress was horrible, and the orders were messed up at our table.  You get wayyyyy more food at other Japanese steakhouses, and more of a show as well.  Half way thru the meal, another guest at our table called the waitress over because she had noticed these boxes right next to us on the floor, turns out they were paper rat traps in plain view, I pretty much lost my dinner right there on the table."}
{"text":"If you are gluten free, do not eat here!!  Our server didn't even know what \"gluten free\" meant, so to avoid any consequences I stuck with an overpriced leaf of iceberg lettuce and a few avocado cubes."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Monroe for sushi.  Take advantage of half priced sushi on Wednesdays and Sundays.   They are fresh, delicious, and service is fantastic. They also have Hibachi which is great for lunch at only 8 bucks.   My favorite place in the local area."}
{"text":"Great new chef the hibachi was amazing! The show was very entertaining great place for familys,party,date. Definitely recommend you check this place out!"}
{"text":"Takara's cruchy roll is to doe for...so much so for about a month I went every few days to get one~ and then two. Excellent staff knew what I wanted when I walked through the door. Tocaras has become a favorite place where friends and I love to meet and catch up from our busy lives~"}
{"text":"When my significant other suggested a late afternoon lunch at Takara today, I was a little skeptical.  I'm very picky about where I will eat sushi, and I certainly wouldn't have immediately listed Monroe as a hot spot for said fare.  However, I was reassured, cajoled, and eventually relented.  I'm glad I did.  The inside of Takara is much classier than one would expect from its strip-mall location, and the food and service were excellent.  The sushi lunch runs about $7 and includes a salad or miso soup.  I chose the soup and it was excellent.  The plate (as pictured above) was perfectly composed and included a California roll, an barbecued eel roll, and a shrimp roll, amongst other things.  The barbecued eel was especially delicious, but everything on the plate was quite tasty.  I'll reserve my judgment of the dinner experience until later (given that they do the whole prepare-entree-at-table thing then), but Takara is a lunchtime winner."}
{"text":"This little Japanese place is deserving of a review from me. I eat here for birthday events with our friends and family. The sushi feels like some of the freshest fish in the world. They make my family feel like we are eating at a fine dining restaurant. We always get seated close to the sushi bar, my wife loves the Monroe roll and I get the hibachi steak with rice.   Recommend this place as a good little out of the way escape to Japan. The only thing is the servers hardly speak English so I just point at what we are ordering to help them out."}
{"text":"While visiting Monroe we ate here twice.  The first time I had seafood soup and an appetizer of steamed dumplings.  My husband had the soup and a fish appetizer which turned out to be yellow tail.  Both visits were pleasant.  The seafood soup had a clear broth I have come to expect from Japanese restaurants but, it seemed a bit thickened which I found unusual.  The fish appetizer was a large portion and provided a goodly amount of protein in a tasty format.  Our second visit was for lunch hibachi and we chose fish and beef.  The presentation was fun, the portions more than adequate, the vegetables fresh and the white rice augmented with egg and carrot.  The price cannot be beat for the luncheon specials.  The south has a bit too much reliance on fried items so this restaurant was my oasis.  All of the staff worked hard to insure our delight.  At the hibachi grill we sat with a young family with a 2 year old and a 9 month old.  The staff took pains to entertain the 2 year old and when the infant was fussy and the mother took the child away, the front desk staff kept the mother and infant company.  I give this place a strong vote for quality of the meal and the staff.  Well done!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Japanese Steakhouse to eat at. Every time I have eaten there I have left with being very full and happy. I love that you can chose to sit at the bar, sit at both/table or sit around the grill and have them cook in front of you. They give very large portions and I always end up getting a to go box for leftovers. For all the food you get the prices are very reasonable. I would recommend eating here to my friends."}
{"text":"Great spot for hibachi!!!  You have to be a little forgiving of the service, these guys and chicks don't speak much english.  It was hard for our waitress to understand us so we had to point to the items on the menu that we wanted.      It has a very nice interior, traditional setup for hibachi.  Everything looked clean and trendy.  (You can order sushi from the hibachi tables also!)    The food is plentiful, we ordered the steak and chicken hibachi and it was a huge portion!  They gave us shrimp as appetizers.  They only give you the shrimp sauce for your meal fyi.  The meat and veggies were super fresh.  (Yes - they do the onion volcano.)  There is a kids menu too!  Kids love this place AND they sing to you if you have a birthday.  Very fun!  Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I take all our family here. The habachi is marvelous and tasty, with additional sushi and drinks available. Speaking of the sushi bar, they have so many choices that we haven't even gotten halfway down the list. All we have had are made in front of us and are tops in flavor and freshness. The servers are friendly and the tables are available anytime we come in. $"}
{"text":"Ok listen, there's not a lot to choose from in Monroe, I think we can all agree on that one.  This is a Hibachi style dining experience located in a little strip mall so of course I was a little suspect when I first came here.  To my surprise it's actually very well put together inside.  In addition to that the food is absolutely fine and best of all plentiful.  My daughter got the kids meal (chicken) and it was just as much as what I had on my plate so that's a good deal in my book.  My only negative takeaway was the wait staff.  I think we literally got a novice that night so I'm not going to rail on them too much but she was pretty slow and confused for most of the meal.  Even the cook was getting frustrated because she got in his way even during the meal.    Bottom line....this is a great option for me and my family for a night on dining :)"}
{"text":"Nice spot located in a mini strip mall on Roosevelt/ independence next to Adam and Eve. I went for lunch on a weekday. My party of 6 was greeted and sat immediately. I didn't see anyone else dinning in the place at noon on a weekday. It made me feel some type of way. But the server took our drink order soon after arriving and had our drinks within minutes soon followed by soup or salad option. I know former reviewers noted the prices, but they have changed 9.95 lunch hibachi (chicken shrimp,etc). It's a decent price because the portion was large. The food was good and it's always fun to watch the cooking show while you eat. The place was clean and I enjoyed myself. The weekend or dinner experience may be different,but for lunch I recommend."}
{"text":"If there was a way to give 0 stars I would. These people are the worst most rude around. We waited for an hour, just to be told for the 3rd time that we were being bumped for yet another large party. They would rather have the business of a large party and send away people that could possibly have been regular customers. This is a terrible restaurant. I should also add that they are not kid friendly. This was probably one of the reasons for being bumped several times. I will never return here ever again. I'll also make sure my friends and family don't ever give this restaurant their business."}
{"text":"Consistently good quality sushi with a descent variety of sashimi and roll options... And, if you want something that isn't on the menu, they will be happy to make it for you.  Standard hibachi tables are also available - nothing any more or less remarkable than any other hibachi restaurant.  The atmosphere is surprisingly nice for a small town sushi restaurant. Owners and staff are friendly.  Definitely one of the best options for sushi in SE Charlotte and Union County."}
{"text":"I've been to Takara twice. Both tines were enjoyable. The servers have great personalities and my cup was never empty. Our cook was great! This past visit we had my 1 year old nephew with us and he was in awe of the cooking display in front of him; the cook was great playing with my nephew. More importantly,  our food was delicious! The prices are reasonable and less expensive than some of the bigger name hibatchi restaurants. We aren't out this way often, but when we are we like to stop at this hibatchi restaurant located in a small shopping strip off of Hwy 74."}
{"text":"At first glance this is your typical run of the mill hibatchi japanese place. We chose a table not at a hibatchi grill. (we're old enough that the show isn't exciting) I ordered the hibatchi shrimp. I was surprised that it wasn't typical. There was a brown sauce on it that was fantastic. I would go back just for that dish. My wife got the catsu chicken, which is something we had in Japan. This also had a traditional Japanese sauce that was very good.  Why only 3 stars? Simple: Atmosphere. We were seated very close to the bar and there was too much chatter by the wait staff who were very close to us. Our server was friendly."}
{"text":"I literally waited over 30 minutes for four little amazing pieces of sushi with no apology or real explanation. Then, the rice immediately detached itself from the fish. Therefore, I cannot recommend this restaurant unless you don't feel like driving far from your hotel. Woe is me."}
{"text":"Well prepared food cooked in front of you. Entertainment provided by the chefs. Good sized portions of the food I ordered."}
{"text":"Good food cooked right in front of you. Service is great and the staff is attentive."}
{"text":"Not worth the money ! We paid 50$ for two people and the rolls were to tiny :/ bit disappointing a regular rainbow roll at. New Zealand cafe will get you full This was like half the normal roll , so no thank you never again"}
{"text":"Part of the fun of a Japanese steakhouse is the cook, right? And this is how reviewing a restaurant can be so subjective! While our neighboring table's chef was fun and exciting and doing some awesome tricks, ours was kindof boring!  Food was awesome though and the service was good too. Our party of three shared a table with nice people so that's always a good experience! All in all, I'd go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge sushi lovers, and that is something Monroe does not have a lot of. I first went here for the hibachi grill experience which I had never done before, which was fun just in its self. I went back the second time for sushi, because our favorite sushi restaurant nearby had closed down, and was pleasantly surprised. Now my favorite place around."}
{"text":"Really hate to do this and have debated it, I have gave it 2 more tries. As you seen Takara was my favorite place for sushi and hibachi, but not anymore. This place has truly gone downhill. The food is not up to par anymore, sushi doesn't taste fresh and is not prepared correctly.  I have gotten sick to my stomach the last 2 times I ate here.The hibachi is greasy and over seasoned. Service is horrible never once checked on during our whole meal and only offered a refill when check was brought. Order continually gotten wrong and the list goes on. No toilet paper or paper towels in the ladies restroom and my hubby said the same for the men's room. I don't know what happened, but Takara is not what it once was. So sad, they have lost me as a loyal customer."}
{"text":"This is definitely a 3-star experience, the food was good. I really loved the ginger dressing on the house salad, and the sushi was fresh and presented well.   Here's the issue--it took forever. The service was O.K. but our waitress struggled with a lot of items on the menu, and at one point had to go get the bartender to assist with taking the drink order of a vodka soda because she didn't know what vodka was. Once we put in our food order it took a while to come out--and it wasn't busy by any means. Finally, the food for two of our people made it to the table and it took over 10 minutes for the third person to get their plate. Again, it really wasn't busy and they had two guys making sushi--I would never have brought out full meals for two people and made the third wait without any explanation.  The food is good, so as long as you don't have high expectations for a great experience it's worth going--prices are on par with sushi in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I love this sushi bar, absolutely would recommend any sushi lover to try them out! I order from them every Wednesday and Sunday for half off sushi and it's really good. Freshly made every time!"}
