{"text":"This place was okay. The chairs were old, food was okay. We were seated quickly and I was starving. It was basic food, in a basic place. Prices were reasonable. Are waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here they have a lot of great food but lately everytime I order hot wings they would serve me old carrots that is not fresh. It does look gross. If your going to give carrots atleast serve them fresh! Otherwise don't give them with the meal. it would only be a waste I throw them away every time."}
{"text":"Tried this location I added to Yelp for the 1st time today. I got the cheese burger with fries, added an extra patty. The price with drink was only $4.50, the extra patty added another $1.75. My wife got the patty melt with fries, also $4.50. I really enjoyed the burger, meat could use a little more seasoning. Yes, this is inside a smoking allowed casino, so there is a prevalent cigarette odor. If you hate smoking odor, you won't like it. If you don't care...it's decent food for a great price!"}
{"text":"The native american indian tacos are good and cheap! My girl loves the buffalo wings and her son enjoys the pizza! Something for everyone. I like the way they have the tables set up 70's style."}
{"text":"It is a goof place, there are better burgers out there.  I got a double burger with onion rings , very solid burger and rings just not outstanding."}
{"text":"Enter the Bingo Hall, make a quick left, and you'll find the Silver Platter.

We felt as though we walked into a time warp with this 1950s style retro fast food luncheonette. There are pictures of Elvis and Jimmy Stewart and Lucy and Desi on the walls and a pricing structure that will knock your Bobby Sox clear off. 

Our Deluxe breakfast sandwiches (2 eggs plus meat and cheese) were a paltry $3.29. Help yourself to free coffee in the Bingo room (if you don't mind the smoke in your lungs while you walk over). 

We had a very filling breakfast for around eight bucks."}
