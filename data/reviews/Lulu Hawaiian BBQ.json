{"text":"Me and the wifey really like this place. Good macaroni salad and BBQ spare ribs. People that work there seem friendly. They need to get the drain problem fixed. Sometimes there's a clogged drain smell."}
{"text":"So good!! First time ordering from them!! The macaroni is delicious the meat is cooked to perfection and almost melts in your mouth!!! And delivery was early!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better.

I can't claim to be a connoisseur of Hawai'ian food, so to say I've experienced better, I'll have to say that as a generality.  Better quality, quantity, and priced food is out there.  For what it is, it's not bad.

I had the combination BBQ plate for a sampling.  It included some thinly sliced beef, ribs, and chicken along with two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad.  Really it wasn't as much food as that may sound, but reasonable.  The ribs very obviously came from a cheaper, older animal, and the chicken is all dark meat (so make no delusions of it being healthier).  Basically they were all thin cuts to quickly grill, sauce, and serve.  So in terms of expediency, I'll give them kudos there.  Oh, and don't expect anything more out of the cashier other than giving your order due to that language barrier I oh so enjoy (seriously)."}
{"text":"Awesome staff. Delicious food. My favorite place to go to eat. Spam musubi & BBQ short ribs plate is my go to food. Love this place. Been going for years and don't plan on changing that any time soon! ^.^"}
{"text":"Dig this place, consistent quality and good selection. Delivery is always early. Chicken is fatty, but that's a good thing for me. Musubis are a good staple and the honey walnut shrimp is bangarang."}
{"text":"I usually get the BBQ mix plate and its good, however the spicy chicken and pulled pork were very dry and not much flavor."}
{"text":"Surprisinly Good. Ok I'm a HUGE fan of Aloha Grill. When I tried this place, I ordered the Honey Katsu Chicken . NICE!

Now the bottom line. This place is good. however, The prices were a little expensive. But if you want a tasty treat, you wont go wrong."}
{"text":"Food is always good, lots of food. Good service,
Very quick delivery and awesome staff!
Order here for good food!"}
{"text":"Love the bbq chicken and the macaroni salad. My favorite place for take out. Clean, friendly, and the kids love it."}
{"text":"Not bad if you're craving hawaiian food and can't make it to the California hotel and casino. Just don't expect it to be authentic.  It's also a notch down from L&L's and you may just feel like you're settling. I took off 1 star because every time I call an order in they usually say 10 or 15 minutes until it's ready. I tend to always get there in about 20 minutes and tend to wait at least another 5 or 10 minutes for them to bring me my order. I took off 2 stars because I had over easy eggs during one time eating there and one of the eggs tasted differently than the others.  Sure enough I was sick later that night due to possibly food poisoning.  The two stars are because of the convenience and the food is decent,  taste wise and portion size wise."}
{"text":"Came here one weekday for lunch since I was craving some Hawaiian food.  Place had a few patrons dining inside.  I looked over their menu and decided on the Loco Moco to go.  Had to wait for around 10-15 minutes for my order and there wasn't anyone else ordering before or after me.  That made me worried that nobody really ordered the Loco Moco.  Maybe they were busy defrosting the hamburger patties still...  

The food itself was actually not bad, not great.  Beef patties, eggs and gravy over white rice.  I would get it again if I was craving it, which is once in a blue moon.  i noticed they had malasadas which i will try next time.  I also want to see how there combination bbq plate is.  I think that's the real way to judge the quality of a Hawaiian fast food joint i.e. L&L and Ohana BBQ."}
{"text":"My go to place for Hawaiian BBQ. Service is good and fast. Would definitely recommend. 

I had the BBQ beef plate which comes with 2 scoops of white rice, macaroni salad, and cabbage."}
{"text":"Order beef barbecue and chicken tonkatsu thru delivery. It was lightning fast. The chicken was crispy and tasty and the beef was tender and juicy. It was really great."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a couple times, and have had a good experience every time. First time we dined in and thought the portion sizes were perfect.  Lau Lau was good and the BBQ Beef was flavorful and not too fatty.  Mac salad was also a winner.  The second time we ordered the catering which was great.  Thoughful in that they separate the mac salad so it doesn't get warm from the rest when you take out.  Glad it's close by to us!"}
{"text":"I placed an order for Katsu Chicken, Loco Moco (mine are better but I did not have eggs), Krab ragoons and egg rolls. I agree with one other review regarding food arriving warm. Had a liquid in the bottom of bag that did not come from my order. I thought it was gravy, but it was lighter. Katsu chicken was just okay, egg rolls greasy, Krab ragoons were edible and Loco Moco smelled and tasted bad. I called to bring it to stores attention not wanting a refund.  A woman answered, I said the loco Moco tastes bad. She said 'Why'. I was not expecting that answer. So I decided not to order for awhile."}
{"text":"Just called to place a pick up order as first time customer. The woman answering the phone couldn't even explain what meats she offered on the menu. Despite my attempts to communicate she got rude and didn't seem to care about helping inform us more on their menu, let alone could she answer any question I had about what specific items they have for meat combinations. Lost my business before I could even try the food - bad service, incompetent workers, and no adequate / detailed online menu."}
{"text":"Food is ok, just dont dont dont dont get the macaroni salad. Tasted like harsh plastic and chemicals. Maybe its ok if they dont give it to you in the plastic container. Otherwise, this place is ok, I like 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate on craig wayyyy better."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good.  Actually, it's now my favorite Lau Lau in town.  It was perfect!

Now, not to sound judgmental (but, in actuality, totally judgmental), but I've found Hawaiian places with pictures of the menu items on the wall to be total letdowns. \"Meh\" city, you might say.  So, I had few hopes of a satisfying meal at Lulu Hawaiian BBQ.  

But, the food turned out to be really good!  The Lau Lau plate was perfect, not overcooked at all.  The quality of the fish was also excellent, the perfect blend of fatty and lean.  I also enjoyed the macaroni salad as it wasn't too caked in mayo.  I would definitely get this again and again and again...

The restaurant is very casual, overall.  But, it's clean and the booths are comfortable.  If I'm ever in the North Las Vegas Walmart parking lot again, I'll stop by."}
{"text":"Best loco mo. I have had in Vegas. And I have had a lot of others.  It rivals having it in Hawaii. (maybe)??"}
{"text":"If u want some hawaiian bbq or some asian fast food this is the place to be... Ive been a regular customer since they open... I love the portion they serve because it will definitely fill u up for lunch or dinner... The service is great n quick... The best food to order is a #24 chicken katsu or a # 14 hawaiian mix plate... I highly recommend to try this place out thanks"}
{"text":"Lulu's Hawaiian BBQ is a phenomenal place to eat lunch and dinner. The food is fresh hot and it comes packed with excellent customer service. My family and I came in after a very long hard day of going to work clocking out coming home cleaning going to take our son to the doctor and then we were so hungry we just went into Lulu's Hawaiian BBQ. So we looked raggedy and our son was snotty and sick and coughing was just terrible. But they made us feel so welcome and they gave us great customer service. The woman who took her order was so kind to my children and the cook was really nice also. I was just really shocked at how amazing their customer service was I feel like customer service is kind of leaving. Anywho their food is really good we ordered the chicken that has the panko  on it with the curry sauce can we say amazing the chicken was so juicy but still was crispy since it was deep fried with panko. My daughter had the soup with chicken it was a hefty Hefty Bowl for 495 my husband had the like double meal or something like that he also got the panko chicken with the Korean BBQ Beef I think and it was amazing we also got some lumpia fresh it was amazing and we got pot stickers and they were extra special as well.


My review was kind of off I'm really tired but I just wanted everyone to know that this restaurant is absolutely the best I'm completely in love with it and I know you will be too if you enjoy good food and awesome customer service"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great! I love there Hawaiian BBQ Chicken! Their Spam is delicious!"}
{"text":"Always nice and fresh food when delivered. I love this place :) their fries are so good!"}
{"text":"The food there is good, hell it can even be great. But the quality of their beef can be atrocious. It's either perfect or grisley like inedible pieces  of shoe leather. But don't take my word for it"}
{"text":"Went once, the girl at the counter was rude. The special was good but asked to trade out one thing due to allergies and they refused; item requested was the same price, why not i asked and was told because they just dont do that. Won't go bk due to bad service. Food was decent tho"}
{"text":"Had errands to run in North Las Vegas so decided to stop here for lunch since my asian boyfriend loves himself some chicken katsu. This place is little and has a nice energy to it, I've gone to L&L BBQ and the cashiers weren't quite as nice as the staff here. Unfortunately hawaiian food isn't my top favorite so I didn't fall in love with my beef short rib plate, tasted a bit sweet like it was cooked in teriyaki BUT the rice was fresh, macaroni salad was exceptional and the ribs were cooked to perfection. Boyfriend devoured his chicken katsu, so im assuming he's a happy camper. Knocked off 1 star because the soda machine was spitting out flat soda, but hey, the food was great, so no complaints :)"}
{"text":"Nice staff. Decent atmosphere. 
Food is amazing. We had the honey chicken katsu , beef lumpia, kolua pork with macaroni salad,,, all were amazing.. (Pardon my spelling). And finished it off with the hot malasadas which are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place, the staff was friendly and the food was delicious, overall good experience :)"}
{"text":"First off let me say the BEEF Lumpia and Thai Tea is excellent, however once I ordered a noodle dish with chicken and spam.  Well the spam was good but the chicken didn't taste like chicken and I can't compare to it what it taste like. I will never order that again.  Will I eat there again,  yes I'll give them another try and order a different dish."}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch special BBQ Beef Bowl and was given a cup for my drink.  I went and filled my cup and as I stepped away from the machine the girl from behind the counter tells me that I have to pay extra for the drink.  I ask what is she taking about and she says if you get the slushi instead of Coke its an extra $3.35.  I asked where ANYWHERE does it say that because I could not find it anywhere on the walls, on the hanging menus or anywhere.  She then shows me on a small handout menu in small writing on the bottom right corner. I tell her how is any consumer supposed to know that prior to choosing a drink from the choices provided. She had no response. I paid because I still wanted the drink.  But that is a rip off. $3.35 for a slushi and they should clearly mark SOMEWHERE that the slushi is not included in the drink choice when you order your meal and handed your cup."}
{"text":"This place has grown to be an awesome northside L&L/AK alternative and our definite go-to when it comes to delivery. The owners are Asian and extremely nice, and the food here just never disappoints! They also have an extensive menu outside of the Hawaiian classics, which means they always have something I'm in the mood for! 

FOR HER: 
- CHICKEN KATSU CURRY -- comes with two scoops of white rice, a side of mac salad and a generous amount of chicken. (TIP: Get the curry on the side so the chicken katsu doesn't get soggy & so it's not overkill!)
FOR HIM:
- WONTON SAIMIN -- ramen noodles with a handful of large wontons in a light broth. (TIP: If ordering to-go/delivery, ask for the noodles & wontons to be separated from soup so they don't get soggy! Add soup to it when ready to eat.) And SPAM MUSUBIS are a must!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise! Some of the best Hawaiian food I've had in Vegas and it was delivered in under 25 minutes!! All food was hot and fresh, essential for a lazy Sunday hangover recovery. The crab rangoon were crispy and a generous ratio of filling to wrapper, plus the dipping sauce was the perfect blend of spicy and sweet. Not to mention the macaroni salad was the best I've had in years, to include my recent trip to Kona. Definitely ordering from them again!!"}
{"text":"I had a craving  for chicken katsu so I thought i would give this place a try. I also got crab Rangoon which was pretty good. Crispy on the outside, cheesy, creamy goodness on the inside. The only problem is they forgot the dipping sauce. The katsu was alright. The macaroni salad was actually pretty good, not to much mayo. The portugese sausage musubi was ok. You only get one piece so it's not really worth the cost. I'll go back and try some other stuff."}
{"text":"LuLu is definitely similar to L&L and Ohana Hawaiian BBQ. Expect the usual Hawaiian plate lunches with white rice, mac salad and your choice of protein.

One thing that sets LuLu apart is that if you're dining in, they'll typically serve you and you pay after your meal rather than ordering up at the counter and paying upfront. It's a little difference that I appreciate especially since they're friendly and attentive.

The dishes are delicious but my absolute favorite would have to be Honey Chicken Katsu! Crispy fried chicken pieces drenched in sweet honey sauce. It tastes like the Honey Walnut Shrimp sauce. It's so good, trust me. Genius, actually. I don't think I've seen anyone else combine that honey sauce with chicken katsu.

I used to go to LuLu in the North side so I was stoked to find out they opened one fairly close to me. Welcome to this side of town, LuLu! See you real soon."}
{"text":"It's a great new spot for Hawaiian food to open up, alongside the likes of Aloha Kitchen and L & L's. With the options for slushi boba, your typical fountain drinks, the ever popular variety of Hawaiian Sun. Plenty of plates to consider for your dine in too."}
{"text":"Hawaiian takeout, similar to L&L. Combo plates, teriyaki bowls, boba teas, and more are available on their large menu. I tried a combo plate with a side of poki for a takeout lunch. Plate size was large, with a generous portion of protein. I liked the flavors and appreciated that the teri sauce wasn't too sweet, but the chicken had an odd, thick skin I didn't care for and the $6.50 poki side was the size of a condiment cup. A friend raves about their roast pork so eventually I'll try more when craving ono eats in this area- props for picking a spot where they don't have much competition for this cuisine."}
{"text":"I am not sure why there are so many poor reviews for this shop. It is the same type of food you get at any Hawaiian bbq place in town, and the portions are big and cheap and they don't charge you for extras. Their katsu and other dishes are very consistent and I have always been pleased with their prompt service. A solid Hawaiian place overall."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places to eat they're very punctual and polite and what else can I say the food speaks for itself absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"Nice place very new three food was good bang for your buck. If you try the sample bbq set.  Didnt try much other then that.  The place closes early and the plaza close around 10pm, wish the plaza would open later and there is a 24 hr gym near by.  Want something simple and quick bbq this place is okay.  Parking is easy. Also they do delivery for large orders"}
{"text":"Fish plate and chicken katsu was good!  Kids/teens enjoyed the spam saimin. Large portions for a good price!  Radio played a channel with static which was annoying. Lol.  Overall, food for family of 5 was a good price and large portions."}
{"text":"I was in the area with the GF running errands and both of us were hungry.  I consorted the oracle that is yelp and found LHBBQ.  Three stars?  That kind of put it on the fence for us, but after seeing Garett A gave it four stars, I was sold!  We rolled in and the layout would lead one to believe it's an \"order at the counter\" sort of place.  But the a nice lady told us take a seat and she would take our order.  I ordered the Honey Katsu Chicken and a side of Carb Rangoon.  The GF ordered up Loco Moco.  Being there around 11:00ish, the speed at which the food arrived was a tad on the \"Island\" time.  But when it arrived all was devoured, and from the chicken to the Loco, the rice, the mac salad, all was found to be delicious!"}
{"text":"Took out from LuLu's for lunch one day. It is very similar to L&L although i feel LuLu's has more variety of choices on their menu. The food is descent, nothing spectacular. But due to our offices location we will take out from here again."}
{"text":"wow! they really serve stuff like this?! ok lets start with the fact that this is not a hawaiian place to eat. you walk in and its a mix of hawaiian, korean, thai foods. if your name is lulus hawaiian bbq then I am assuming you serve hawaiian food. well they do just not anything I would go back to get again. I had the loco moco and was flat out surprised how bland and unappetizing it was. I give them the rice, a lot of rice but that's about all. frozen patties,  some white gravy, and mac salad that is just not up to par. nothing was seasoned as far as the frozen patties, eggs, or mac salad was concerned. if you cant make a simple hawaiian dish such as one loco moco then that's enough for me to stay away. heads up people get way mo bettah places down da road das worth da drive. if you think dis place is good den you missin out on life. on to da nex one!"}
{"text":"This place is my go to place when we're too tired to cook for dinner , everyone in the house loves it , Katsu chicken is my fav , the kids love the spam musubi and my husband loves the short ribs !"}
{"text":"I ordered the Atkins meal to be delivered. They were so kind, they called me to confirm that it was the way I wanted. It came earlier than I thought it was going to be here. 

The food was delicious I will be eating there again. I will be ordering delivery from there again. I am so happy!"}
{"text":"As a broke college student, eating out shouldn't happen, but it's tough to pass up good deals 
Went with the 2 meat combination plate (you pick) and decided on the short ribs + chicken katsu. The meal included two scoops of rice and macaroni salad. The food was made fresh and quickly. 
Total came out to a little over $10 for something I couldn't finish in one sitting. 
I ordered for pick up so I wasn't able to experience the customer service side, but the store itself was clean. 
Definitely will be back if I'm ever craving Hawaiian BBQ !!"}
{"text":"The food was good. Shrimp tempura was a good portion and delicious. Delivery was faster than the estimated time so, very happy about that. Very polite. Will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"Good portion sizes for the low prices. Consistent taste in food unlike some other places in the area. Always very fast and friendly- I usually call for take out it takes between 5-10 minutes to get ready. Overall, good quality, low prices, and quick service!"}
{"text":"my favorite place to visit for a nice lunch, and my favorite place for a casual date. good food for a good price and a great atmosphere. worth it. the macaroni salad is to die for"}
{"text":"This is based on their Shrimp Curry. 
We love Hawaiian food and eat it wherever we can find a restaurant.
So sad to write this review because I don't want to give up on Lulu's yet.
Poke and curry is something I try at every joint I go.
But this place, I don't know...it isn't hitting the spot.
The last two times I've gotten the curry it was either too salty or not enough gravy but the thing that kills me is they bread the shrimp for the curry. It tastes like left overnight shrimp from the walnut shrimp. My last and I really mean my last order was full of hunks of breading that didn't even have shrimp in it! For the price I paid, I'd like some shrimp!!!
The breaded part isn't even the deal breaker..it's the fact the shrimp breading was so salty and then you pour an already salty curry sauce on top...nope. Just nope. 
I was too hungry, and decided (against my better judgement) to PICK the breading off maybe 6 small, dry as all hell shrimp...now I'm hangry because of this and can't even bring myself to eat the curry sauce and rice.  Picture included.     Shame Lulu, shame."}
{"text":"I ordered a half and half bbq plate. They gave me the wrg order. I wanted beef and chicken and she gave me chicken and some kind of fish... even tho she gave me the wrong order.. i did like the fish... Compared to l&l thus place gives less rice less macaroni. I did like the lemon slice but it could do without the lettuce. And put more cabbage.. thanks...  food was ok."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken katsu curry and what I got was gravy!! If you're gonna do Japanese curry do it the right way, the curry had no flavor at all not even a little salt. Just wish these guys had more passion in cooking cause I damn sure wouldn't let my curry go out tasting like that."}
{"text":"I was excited to see another place open in the area, especially so conveniently located near other places I shop (ROSS, Albertson's, etc). 

I went in, not really having much expectation. The gal behind the counter was not friendly. I wouldn't say rude, but she definitely didn't want to be at work that day. 

The place was clean, but had an... off... smell to it. That should have been my first clue. 

We ordered the ribs place (our go-to) and I ordered the chicken Katsu as well. I took the order to go, as we didn't live that far away. 

The food was still warm/hot by the time I got home. We pulled everything out and... no. Just. NO. 

The meat plate (Kalbi ribs) were so off-putting we couldn't bring ourselves to eat it. My 15 month old, who LOVES Kalbi, wouldn't even touch it. The Katsu had good crisp breading, but the sauce was not right. Something about it, just didn't taste good, and I couldn't figure it out. We ended up tossing over half the food (something my mom NEVER does) because it was just terrible. Will definitely not be going back there."}
{"text":"Stop in most Saturdays while shopping. The use thigh meat for chicken katsu, which I love. 

Service is quick and friendly. It is exactly what you'd expect from Hawaiian fast food. Food served in styrofoam, stripped but hearty and big portions."}
{"text":"Been there twice food was excellent specially the lulu fried noodles and the price is not bad , they give a big portion also... love the food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is rather cute inside. The food initially was very tasty. I order the half and half plate, half Katsu half BBQ ribs. My mother did the seafood plate with the BBQ Ribs and needless to say both of our stomachs were left upset. Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Food takes FOREVER! We waited almost half an hour for some FAST food that tastes worst than a TV dinner. I ordered a mini garlic shrimp that had 4 tiny shrimp in it. If you are going to give me 4 shrimp they better be big prawns not salad shrimp. My wife ordered chicken katsu and shrimp tempura. They didn't give her any katsu sauce for her bland chicken and the tempura looked like the frozen ones from costco. What a joke. Never coming back here. 

To go boxes were piling up. They don't know how to manage the food that is put out by the kitchen. I understand that you guys deliver but if the delivery guy is not back then give the customers sitting in your restaurant their food."}
{"text":"This new Hawaiian bbq spot is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. There really aren't too many options in this area for hbbq. 

I ordered the bbq mix plate to go. The mix plate has short ribs, teriyaki beef and teriyaki chicken. I didn't care for any of it because it was all fatty and stringy. Even the chicken had a thick layer of skin which I found odd. The mac salad was tasty but this place isn't any better than it's competitors.

Editied to add - they offer delivery which is pretty cool. And they have honey chicken katsu. Like the sauce that comes on honey walnut shrimp, but instead on katsu. Sounds interesting and I must try. I will be back."}
{"text":"My review is based on the Kalua Pork only!

I went to Lulu Hawaiian BBQ specifically for the Kalua pork. I make my own and eat at L&L when I want Kalua Pork. I have to say I wasn't impressed. 

The pork was dry and rubbery. They didn't have the option to have with cabbage which was ok, but I prefer cabbage in my Kalua pork."}
{"text":"Just like L&L back home in hawaii.  Friendly staff, good food, and clean restaurant. Honey chicken Katsu is good!"}
{"text":"Love the Hawaiian food at Lulu's. I usually get the kalua pork.  It's always so good.  It comes with a couple scoops of rice and a scoop of Hawaiian macaroni salad."}
{"text":"I love this place. For North Las Vegas where our food places are somewhat scarce, compared to other parts of the valley. It's a great spot with great service."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I'm just a good ol southern boy from Texas and I usually just go for meat and potatoes. But I was driving by and decided to turn in. I asked the guy at the counter what he thought I should order. He recommended I do the pick two combo. So I got the beef short ribs and some Katsu chicken. It came with some white rice and and some macaroni salad. He gave me two different kinds of dipping sauce for the meats. I was very surprised in the amount of food the shoved into the to go container. It weighed like eight pounds. 

I'll be back to try some other stuff. Just not sure if I'll order any of that spam. They even had some seaweed wrapped spam with white rice. Could remember the name let along know how to say it."}
{"text":"I had the chicken katsu curry.  It was a little curry sauce poured over the katsu.  Not bad, but not really great.  Wife and I shared a crab rangoon and it was good."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch had the half/half chicken katsu, bbq beef great choice food was delicious. The chicken was crunchy and juicy, the beef tender and flavorful. Also had some of the crab Rangoon, very good ratio of filling to pastry, also had some great flavor! Will definitely get some again! Overall great spot and very nice workers."}
{"text":"not good.
not fresh.
not tasty.

very disappointing.

i think i'll stick to aloha kitchen or l&l."}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian food! Way Better than aloha kitchen once ive tried this place ive been coming back since, wife loves the egg rolls and bbq chicken bowl and i like getting the chicken katsu"}
{"text":"Ehhh this place is just ok now...seemed to have gone down hill since I thought it was decent before. The meats in the BBQ mix plate were under marinated and the beef and short ribs were dry and tough. I actually had to use the teriyaki sauce, which I never do, on the meat to flavor it. The mac salad was a weird yellowish color and could've been sitting a bit but tasted fine. The chicken was the only thing that was good and not overcooked. Hopefully it was just an off day but I'm going to be coming here a lot less in the future. Lulu definitely won't be among my top choices and I'd probably only come in for a chicken plate at this point."}
{"text":"We got the chicken katsu, spicy chicken,curry katsu chicken, sausage musubi. And everything was okay except for the spicy chicken, they burnt it and put wrong seasons In it and it tasted horrible. My husband and I both took a bite and threw the whole thing out... wasted 10 on that meal. I would recommend only ordering their chicken katsu and their chicken katsu curry as their sausage masubi roll was eghhh and the seaweed was kinda off. All honestly for a Hawaiian place this didn't blow my mind and I would go to others next time for better food."}
{"text":"Great place.  The menu is lengthy, the prices are decent.  Service is always very courteous and helpful.  Usually get the portugese sausage, rice, and eggs.  Great portions and tasty.  Also a convenient location for me."}
{"text":"Usually pretty good, but today I went in and told them I was there for a pick up and sat down and no one said anything to me and I ended up waiting for an extra 20 minutes. 

Update: unfortunately I got a mac salad today with hair in it. /: my hair is curly grey"}
{"text":"Food wasn't anything great! Honestly,  I wouldn't go back nothing to rave about.  I was disappointed"}
{"text":"It's so delicious love their bowls around $6 comes with broccoli, full of rice and you can choose chicken/beef and comes with fountain drink of choice"}
{"text":"BBQ short rib was really good and the meal portions were huge! Cheeseburger and fries for my daughter was tasteless as if the fries, bun, and burger all came from a bag. Lettuce was wilted and it just looked like a sad cheeseburger. The customer service was decent and it was not busy, I was here on Monday or Tuesday evening around 6:30."}
{"text":"This is my first time and it will be my last. I ordered delivery and live 5 minutes away. The chicken was squishy under cooked. The skin on chicken was slimy and disgusting. Don't eat here. Food was so bad I tossed it in the trash."}
{"text":"We were in a mood for something different, so we decided to order using delivery from Lulu's tonight. SO glad we did!
We got the Barbeque Chicken Plate that includes 2 big scoops of rice and a macaroni cup, which was awesome! Lot's of food and very tasty. Then we got the Kahlua Pork regular plate, and it was really flavorful and also a generous helping of meat. The egg rolls we ordered we fantastic, and had a slightly spicy dipping sauce which really complimented the rolls. 
The delivery time was also half of what we were expecting! We're definitely going to eat from here again...soon!"}
{"text":"Fake version of L&L. The food is nasty...all of it! If I could, this review would be ZERO stars. First and last time we ever come here again. Ordered a bunch of stuff and it all had a weird aftertaste. One ton saimin had a broth that tasted like water. Spam musubi, don't know what kind of sauce they put on it, but it tasted weird. My husband ordered the beef curry. It came with 4 pieces of meat that looked like it came out of a can, with literally only one piece of carrot and 1/2 a potato that where both crunchy and undercooked. The potstickers where soggy as well. 
This place sucks!"}
{"text":"Everyone was getting spicy chicken according to the reviews so I thought I'd try it. Not really spicy at all, I find mongolian beef is spicier. Expected more flavor and a bigger menu. Great service though. Very kind people. Did wait a bit for food but it came out fresh so that only makes sense. Overall I would recommend this place to others in the area."}
{"text":"What a strange little place! Don't get me wrong, it's decent, but just a little bit odd. 

In an effort to grab a bite before a work event my partner and I stumbled upon this place. We had no idea what the hell we wanted to eat and Lulu won our vote simply because of proximity. The only thing we needed to see was Spam musubi on the menu and we felt safe to proceed with our gamble. 

Our order consisted of two Spam musubis, an order of kalua pork and some kind of a grilled BBQ chicken plate. After reading that the only difference between a small and large plate was the number of scoops of rice and mac salad we decided that the small would do just fine. 

When the food came out we were quick to realize that something was lost in translation and we received pork of some kind, but definitely not kalua. Time was tight and we decided to roll with the error and when all was said and done it was a-ok. The chicken on the other hand looked like it had been run over by a truck. In fact it didn't look like chicken at all but rather a piece of county ham. This plate was the weakest of the bunch and thank goodness the mac salad and musubi reeled me back in a bit. 

Exceptional? Nah. Did it get the job done. Sure did!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Loco Moco and was served a nice plate but flavorless food. Meat had 0 flavor and the eggs needed something. Gravy was salty. Overall a disappointment and sadly I won't be back"}
{"text":"My friend is Hawaiin, i took him there, I was sad and apologized for the food, did not tell him how much it cost as it was very overpriced...worst restaurant in Vegas imho."}
{"text":"Conventional Hawaiian BBQ joint.  I enjoy that they deliver even though it's only w/in a 5-mile radius (I'm in that safe zone).  The saimin isn't as good as L&L's saimin but everything else is good.  Need I mention again that they deliver? :)"}
{"text":"Im always down to try places I have not been to so I was assuming this place would be similar to Aloha Kitchen or L and L.

With that said it was just ok. I ordered Honey Walnut Shrimp, Spicy Chicken, and Loco Moco. To top it off we ordered a Mango Smoothie with Boba.

The Honey Walnut Shrimp was a bit on the sweeter side. The Spicy Chicken was medium spicy and a bit on the greasy side. The Loco Moco was really good but for some reason they gave me way too much rice. 

Now for the Mango Smoothie with extra boba. Waaaaaaaaay too sweet! I could only take a couple sips and I was done. 

They are situated in a pretty nice location complimented with a Super Wal-Mart across the parking lot. Their set up is pretty spacious with a decent amount of tables and booths. 

Service was decent. They get you your food as soon as its done.

So overall, I have nothing overly good or bad to report. I would probably go here once in a while. It just wouldnt be my first choice."}
{"text":"Good roast pork with gravy...seasoned well.  Honey chicken katsu had a nice twist...my mom's laulau plate was decent but needed some delicious fat...lol.  Great location...nice service.  Mac was similar to L & L's (Lake Mead and Buffalo location)....so it's good enough."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and hot. I got a menu in the mail and saw that they deliver, which is a nice change from all the pizza places. The food got here real quick around 30 mins. I like the fact that the separate the Mac salad so it stays cold. And the pot stickers were the biggest I've ever seen. Best Hawaiian food in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I go to this Hawaiian BBQ place because it is so close to home. It is not bad but its not great I would say it is average. The prices I think are a bit much for what you get. If you get a side of seaweed salad (which I love) it cost about $4. With that you would expect a good side portion. However, for $4 you only get about an ounce maybe 4 ounces. Knowing that the portion is a joke, I go for the large size of Poki - raw tuna (my second favorite thing) that cost $12. This is a side keep in mind! Nonetheless I pay it because it is really good (totally recommend). Lastly I get their spam musabi this is the average going price of $2.50 I believe. I do think the spam to rice ratio is off. They overcompensate with a large amount of rice, but hey its still good to me! Again this isn't my favorite place but I will come back due to the fact it is so close."}
{"text":"My grandpa wanted a \"lunch plate\" for his birthday dinner, decided to come here. We made a great choice, food tastes like it was from back home. Nice lady at the register gave us free drinks cuz we ordered so much food! 

There plates are jam packed with food and are a very reasonable price. My son pounded his chicken katsu. The fried noodles and garlic shrimp was my fav!

Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"We placed an order for delivery directly via the Yelp app and the food came fast and fresh. Their meat dishes, particularly kalua pork and katsu chicken, are above average and the prices are more than reasonable."}
{"text":"New spot for Hawaiian food, I was going to be in the area and wanted to try it out, so I ordered it on Eat 24. I didn't order any plates, I just got 2 orders of Spam Musubi because I love it, and a boba drink, but I passed on it, good thing I did because when I got there it's just in those slushie machines and I'm not a fan of that. I was probably just a minute early than the time I put in Eat 24, I paid and still had to wait for them to package my food even though there was no one else waiting, but that was my experience, next time I'll try something else and hope my experience will be better, p.s. I did enjoy my musubi and the sauce that came with it"}
{"text":"They were alright.  Noticed this place as I was walking by, and because I was missing local food, I decided to eat here.  Place was completely empty, noticed a worker eating his lunch at a table and the girl at the counter needed some customer service skills.   I ordered the Kalua and Lau Lau plate and an order of Malasadas.  Food came pretty quick, but because it was just my son and I were the only ones there, I felt like they were just staring at us, either because they weren't used to having people it in or they were hoping we would like the food.  Kalua was tasty, but the lau lau was dry...... Malasadas curbed my craving, but I had to drizzle some shoyu on it in order for me to eat it. I'll try it again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Love Love Love the poki here! Worth every penny! And the delivery is always quick. Thank you guys for providing excellent service and pleasee keep the poki on the menu ! ;)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Super clean and modern atmosphere. Very similar to L&L but I might like this place better. Their service is out of this world. I tried the fried shrimp mini platter and the shrimp was fresh, crunchy and had great flavor. I really really like their rice too it's a little stickier than other places which makes it soooo good. This is my new go to spot plus they deliver within a 4 mile radius."}
{"text":"We decided on delivery tonight because neither one of is wanted to do dishes.  Both the Katsu and BBQ Chicken were phenominal and delivery was timely.  Delivery guy cut through my freshly seeded lawn, that was my only complaint."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the people who work here. There kindness is equal to their food. Its amazing."}
{"text":"Great drinks. Clean environment. Didn't eat because I wasn't hungry. Allison, the bartender, has great energy and a kind spirit. You can't go wrong late at night, when I was there. Very productive place and open till 2am."}
{"text":"The taste of the food here reminds me of Home in Hawaii .....and the service is friendly 
Definitely recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"I know there are so many Hawaiian BBQ places out there, but since we were in the area, we decided the stop by and check it out.  

Located off 215 and Decatur, on the opposite end of the parking lot of Walmart is a decent size Lulu Hawaiian BBQ place.  The place did have a lot of parking, of course being across the street of a Walmart parking lot, you can basically park where you want.  It is a clean restaurant, a bit confusing at first but we were sat at the booth.  You can also order to go if you like.  They even have catering options as well.  

The food selection is good, the food itself is decent.  Doesn't really remind me of Hawaii, but its close enough.  I did like the egg, rice and spam, which I really like.  The wife got the loco moco, which didn't really taste the same in Hawaii, but it was edible.  I had a few bites and it wasn't that bad.  

The service seems to be on the quiet side.  They did say hello, but after that, the only thing next was \"May I take your order?\"  Its not rude in a sense, but kind of lacks that service feel.  Especially if we're the only people in the restaurant.

Overall, it was okay.  I'm sure if people looking for Hawaiian food, this place may be okay and probably prepare you, if you ever go to Hawaii.  But only if you're in the area, and craving Hawaiian BBQ, its not that bad, food is decent, service may not be as good."}
{"text":"Got the kalua pork and lau lau pork it was good. I never been to a hawaiian restaurant that had table service.  How fancy! =)"}
{"text":"The food was as delicious as I expected ... Ordered Delivery and my food arrived really fast and nice and freshly made as if I went to pick it up myself ... Definitely would order again ..."}
{"text":"Ever since I stopped by just for boba this one day... My BF scoped out the menu, tried a few things and fell in love with this place. 

If you like L&L, you'll love this place. Same quality as L&L... But a lot cheaper and they aren't stingy with their portions! I love their Chicken Katsu! It's always hot and crunchy when served. 

My BF LOVES the bbq chicken musubis! Always orders 2+ of them. 

Try this place out. You'll love it"}
{"text":"Their chicken lumpias are super good!!! Next time I won't wait to munch on them. It doesn't do the crunch any favor leaving them in the box. But the flavor was still great! 

I also had the BBQ Chicken Bowl. It's simple with rice and broccoli. The chicken was tender and not too salty. Comes with sauce. I could use more of that sauce. However, my sriracha instinct took over. (I know you gots sriracha instinct too! Don't be rollin' your eyes at meeeee.)

Hey though! They have saimin noodle soup. I love saimin! It's comfy for colds. I remember that was the first time I ate here. Not all places serve saimin.

Other pluses: Yelp Eat24, clean and colorful interior, conveniently located in Rainbow Plaza. Aaaaaand they have a good selection of Hawaiian Sun! I wanted to get all the passion fruit blends."}
{"text":"I love this place its awesome ,food is great and I always get my food delivered on time.
Thank you for your excellent work"}
{"text":"This place is great ... 20 minutes before closing they still deliver delicious food thank you so much !!... especially our delivery guy!"}
{"text":"Meh. Wasn't that great. The Mac salad was pretty much mayo and noodle. I ordered the honey katsu chicken meal. It was a large portion of food, but lacking flavor. Nothing wow'd me enough to return."}
{"text":"I have never had Hawaiian Bbq that tasted this bad in my life. Ribs were poorly seasoned, overly salty. Chicken was burnt, not seasoned with any flavor and definitely tasted way too salty. Salad was wilted at the bottom and pork was burnt. Macaroni was not that great either. I guess I was privileged to eat better Hawaiian BBQ in California, but this really disappointed me."}
{"text":"I love Lulu! I have gotten take-out and eaten in the restaurant several times, and last night I ordered through Yelp for the first time for delivery. They came 15 minutes earlier than my scheduled delivery time, which was great! I usually get the mini chicken and two spam musubis. The chicken is always moist and I swap the mac salad for an extra scoop of rice to enjoy it with. The spam musubi is delicious and the seaweed is fresh. I love Lulu!"}
{"text":"Best in the North West. Hot and fresh. Crab Rangoon was great. One of the other Hawaiian BBQ places nearby doesn't even have it. Chicken Katsu is my favorite. I suggest dining in. Service was great."}
{"text":"This is my favorite island style restaurant. The bbq chicken is the best. So tender and juicy. You have to try the spam musubi. It's delicious. Another favorite for cold days is the wonton saimin. We come here at least every 2 weeks and are never disappointed.
Really great food."}
{"text":"This place hits the spot whenever I go there. It's good enough to go there once every few weeks."}
{"text":"So it actually been to this place a few times and I was there yesterday kind of I was really craving Hawaiian food but I was too lazy to drive and I went on here and I saw that they delivered so it was like sweet I don't have to leave the house there is a $10 minimum for delivery and usually I just get Hawaiian soda which is my favorite but I wanted to try something else and I try the spam rice sushi thing which I forgot the name of it already but it was pretty good even though I'm really I really don't like seaweed I think it smells terrible but of course it's seaweed. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that they sell Boba slushies and they are like super sweet like diabetic sweet and I am such like a boba fan after going to Kung Fu tea so I kind of like the idea of something Boba that's close to home however it doesn't make up for that at all so that's why I give it 4 out of 5 stars"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time to this place. I ordered my favorite, Loco Moco. The people were nice and the food came quickly. The Loco Moco was terrible. The sauce was almost non-existent, the meat was pretty poor quality, my over-medium egg was over cooked on the outside so it was hard to cut into. I could have actually gotten past all of this and eaten it but there was a weird mild blueberry tasting hint to everything. It got so off-putting I couldn't finish even half. It's too bad because everything looks so good in there."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Hawaiian food. Simply because I get an upset stomach pretty much right after I eat the food.  I was next door to the Eye District by Jo (see my other reviews) and finished things up. My wife suggested this place. We walked in and the first thing I noticed was that it was super clean. The menu boards were beautiful! The flooring is something that I would put in my house.  My wife ordered the teriyaki chicken and I ordered the katsu chicken.  The girl behind the counter was friendly and a few minutes after placing our order it was brought to our table. The portion size was huge. I could feed 3 people with one plate!  My chicken was tasty. The sauce was also something I liked.  My wife liked her food but didn't care for the teriyaki sauce.  When we left, I thanked the girl behind the counter and she nodded her head back. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Five-service! They have really stepped up when you dine in! Brought me water and checked in on me. Food is always good!"}
{"text":"I have yet to dine at the actual restaurant. Aside from their boba slushies, I've only tried their delivery services (Photos of their menu can be found on their Facebook site: https://www.facebook.com/luluhawaiianbbq). Delivery costs $2.00 and the food typically arrives within 30 minutes. Out of the few times we ordered from Lulu, the food has never arrived hot, but warm. 

On two separate occasions, I've ordered two different meals.

Chicken Katsu Curry (no rice, just mac): Portions are huge! There were plenty strips of breaded and deep fried chicken that were crammed into one takeout container. Some chicken strips were tender and some were a little tough to chew. Because I opted for no rice and chose to keep the mac salad, I received a separate container filled with mac salad rather than a small scoop.

Seafood Platter: Comes with breaded and fried shrimp, mahi mahi, and scallops, except I didn't receive any scallops. The shrimp looked very well-done; its color reminded me of deep fried onion rings. Even though it looked cooked, the inside wasn't. I still got a taste of raw batter. The two pieces of mahi mahi were the frozen variety found in the freezer section of a grocery store. They were pallid and appeared they had been warmed up rather than fried. 

I would like to give Lulu a few more stars, but their food, though better than their boba slushies, left me disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible! Went in and ordered a loco moco and grilled salmon to go. Got all the way home ready to eat and the loco moco didn't have gravy! Called and since they offer delivery I figured they would bring me a new loco moco but NO! Come back to store and pickup gravy. So I went back, pissed! Picked up the gravy and went home. Opened the gravy and it is like dirty mop water not gravy"}
{"text":"I ordered with a coworker for dinner the food came and it was hot smelled good but.......

My coworker got a metal piece in her dish, which was big enough to cut her mouth and my food tasted like sour chicken that had been under cooked. 

I emailed eat 24 the website we ordered from and they contacted the restaurant. The restaurant denied a refund of the dishes and insisted to re-deliver the food we ordered.

WHY WOULD I WANT TO EAT FROM HERE AGAIN?

I did not get any refund and I have contacted the Health Department with this claim. 

Dont order from here, I have never stepped inside this restaurant but dont think I ever will. I dont know if the place is up to standards or the employees dont watch what they put in the food. 

I dont know the people that work here and never want to say their customer service is bad because I dont know the staff. This review is off of the food and experience with this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. We order every time we're in town for work. Love that they deliver. It's always there quick even though they may tell us 45 min: only downside is they usually leave something out. A side order or whatever sauce we've requested. Still so good we will keep ordering."}
{"text":"The garlic shrimp and katsu chicken was delicious.  The service was fast and friendly.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"This was first time using the delivery app and eating food from this restaurant.  The delivery service was super fast. About forty minutes faster than expected time. Overall, the food was delicious. We had the honey katshu chicken, BBQ mix, fried rice, lumpia and the seafood plate which was our least favorite.  Even the macaroni salad was delicious and I don't normally eat macaroni salad. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Cashier and staff are really nice all the times I've been here. Lately, I've been ordering their BBQ beef bowl, served with broccoli and steamed rice. Always yummy and I tend to crave this specific bowl A LOT! I never have to wait over 15 mins for a meal here. The last time I was here with my boyfriend he ordered the lau lau and kalua pig combination. I was so surprised at how good it was. I remember ordering that same combo a couple years back and it was too smokey, dry and with not enough taste but now it's nearly perfect. I am from Hawaii so I know how good those dishes are supposed to be and their food is pretty good. Their malasadas are very good as well, when served was very hot as well."}
{"text":"Best won ton saimon soup! Its the only thing I order when not feeling too hot! That and some warm malasadas can cure even the worse flu!"}
{"text":"I'll give it a solid 3 1/2 stars.  Not bad for non-Hawaiians!

Was itching for some local food that day & wifey said that L&L wasn't going to cut it.  And Aloha Specialties at The Cal was just too far away...plus we were hungry.  That's how we ended up at Lulu Hawaiian BBQ!

I've never been here before so I was of course skeptical.  Walk inside and whaddaya know?!  Chinese owners!!  Are we back at an L&L clone?  Now I was super skeptical.  Not that you Chinese folks don't know how to run a restaurant (though many of you have had your Chinese restaurants featured on Channel 13's 'Dirty Dining' segment, shame shame) but man, why can't there actually be more local Hawaii people running a Hawaiian BBQ joint?  It just makes no sense to me!  And the ones that do, are the best ones!

Lulu Hawaiian BBQ overall is average, edible for the most part.  The ordering scheme and menu is similar to that of L&L and Ohana Hawaiian BBQ here in Las Vegas.  Hawaiian 'local' food in mini or regular size plates.  On this day I was craving a best-seller back on the Islands...Chicken Katsu.

The little one and I both ordered regular size Chicken Katsu plates.  Wifey ordered one of their daily specials, the Sweet Chili Chicken plate.  Our orders were out within 10 minutes, so at least the service there is fast.  But taste, oh taste, that is another thing!

Serving sizes for regular plate lunches were on par with other establishments.  Meaning for a Hawaiian BBQ, it was a lot!  Two full scoops of steamed white rice on each plate, a bunch of chicken pieces on each too, and a big scoop of macaroni salad on the side in a separate container (nice touch to avoid it from getting warm).  Our Chicken Katsu plates also had a side container of katsu 'sauce' (I say this loosely).

But the taste of the Chicken Katsu just wasn't there!  Lots of pieces of chicken but no flavor in them!  They were fried just right too, golden brown.  But were virtually tasteless.  No salt, no MSG before or after frying?  Even with the katsu 'sauce'...which come on, is basically ketchup mixed with Worscestershire sauce, sugar, and maybe some applesauce at this place...was not helping.  A real katsu sauce is fruit based and complements the fried food!  Lulu Hawaiian BBQ had a WEAK sauce, not my favorite.  This is why most times when I go to a Hawaiian BBQ place here, I often bring my own (yes) katsu sauce in a bottle.  You'll be amazed what a katsu sauce like Bulldog or even Kikkoman's can do for your chicken katsu!  Sooooo much better!

The Sweet Chili Chicken plate was not a favorite of the wifey either.  It was basically fried chicken pieces covered in bottled sweet chili sauce.  It was too sweet, and again, chicken wasn't seasoned properly!  Guys, please salt & pepper your chicken before cooking!  World of difference.  Wifey really couldn't finish all of her plate lunch.

For me the best part of the meal was the all-important macaroni salad.  At least Lulu Hawaiian BBQ got this mostly right.  Macaroni was cooked well, still cold, was creamy enough (without being too heavy), and had the right component of just some shredded carrot in it.  But...light on the seasoning!  Not enough salt.  After adding some of my own is came out just right.  Then I went and did my thing and added a healthy dose of cracked black pepper, a dash of soy sauce, and a little splash of Tabasco!  Oh yeah, eat that sucker up!

And what is with these Hawaiian BBQ places adding BOBA on the menu?  Is this your Chinese kicking in?  It's just so strange, keep it simple and offer Hawaiian Sun drinks!  Although we did give in and got a mango boba for the little one, a bit pricey at like $3.50 a cup.  But, it wasn't bad, the boba was actually made right.

Value was decent for a Hawaiian BBQ joint, I may be back to Lulu for Chicken Katsu again one day when we are on that side of town again.  But from now on, I will bring my own katsu sauce!

{"text":"A nice & quiet place to eat a good lunch or dinner a few minutes AWAY from the hustle & bustle of Las Vegas. The food is typical fare found in Hawaiian fast food places....plentiful and great tasting.  They have a large menu so there are many options.  They also have Thai Tea, slushes and boba. Food is served in styrofoam which was pointed out by my first-born child.  He made a comment that food always tastes better on real plates. Mmmmm....just a thought.  LOL!!!  Anyway, if you're in Vegas visiting or a local that hasn't given this place a shot, well...now you know."}
{"text":"The Barbeque chicken was bland... dipped in the Teriyaki sauce it was edible but I think Barbecue chicken should have some taste of it's own.
I'm not a fan of Mac Salad so I won't give an opinion on that....

The dumplings were umm GROSS is the word. The breading was just too much and it wasn't even cooked all the way. The inside meat was tastless - yeah that was not good. We sent it back and they gave us Fried wontons with a ground chicken filling. The fried wontons tasted better but still rather bland to me.

My friend ordered the Spam, eggs and rice plate. She liked her food but we both agreed that it's hard to mess up anything on that plate. Thank goodness Spam is full of flavor on it's own.

The Malasadas were OK - weird aftertaste after eating the second one though.

The spicy chicken looked good in the picture on the wall and speaking of walls the hibiscus painting on the walls were cute but all in all I just don't think I'll have any desire to come back - L & L is just closer and tastier!!!"}
{"text":"I Hate Giving Not So Good Reviews for Places, but I Gotta Do What I Gotta Do... The Food is Pretty Good, All are Hot, Delish and Worth Coming Back for. The Eatery is Kept Well Maintained. On a Slow Day, the Cashier will Actually Seat you, and Take Your Order. He Serves your Food, instead of you Getting it Yourself, and Takes the Check when you are done. I don't know if they usually do this, or he was just trying to be nice to pretty girls..lol!

The Problem was with the Catering Aspect of it...Recently My Sister Catered from them for her Housewarming Party...Everything was fine, Until we noticed something! We ordered the Teriyaki BBQ Meat, and well...let's just say there was a whole lot of FILLERS (meaning shredded cabbage filled to the top)and only about a Layer or Two of BBQ Meat! I couldn't believe it...and the Noodles, well were Soggy! Despite those Disappointments, My Sister's Party was still a Success! =)

**The Food is Good, Don't Get Me Wrong, it's just the Catering Part that I would Highly Think Twice About!"}
{"text":"My Sons turned me on to this place for delivery. I have used them twice for lunch delivered to the house. I have to say each time the food has been outstanding. I get the BBQ Mixed plate, Ribs, Chicken and Beef. Good stuff. Wifey loves their Mac Salad and the Chicken Katsu, crunchy and tasty. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Ok... I went to LU LU's other location off Decatur and after getting home with my order realized ... it's a disappointment.  I ordered beef and chicken Lumpias and what I got were soggy \"egg rolls\". Seriously, if the Asian community needs another restaurant then don't hide behind the name \"Hawaiian BBQ\". If you want more authentic dishes go to LU LU's other locations .....again, what a huge let down. Managers should get together to ensure menus and dishes are the same."}
{"text":"Have had this place for maybe three times now and every time consistent! Not five stars because the lettuce with the dishes are always brown but it's not like I would eat it anyway so it's not a big deal. I usually get the plates and they're really big portions and a lot of food. The fried shrimp is the one I recommend. Fast service as well. Friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! The cashiers are always so sweet and welcoming. My food is always fresh and tastes great."}
{"text":"We ordered off eat 24 tonight as today was our lazy day. Food was amazing and portions were real generous! And delivery literally only took 40minutes at the most! We are satisfied :)"}
{"text":"Wow this place has portions out of this world! Got an order of delivery of chicken cutlet with gravy, loco moco, Lulu fried noodles. 

Chicken cutlet seemed to have an endless supply of chicken cutlet it could have easily been 3 servings the gravy was nice and light but also tasty.  
The loco moco was traditional but also their twist with the gravy and the hamburger patties were also big. 
The fried noodles reminded me of pancit."}
{"text":"I pretty much order their fried wontons at least once a week. They're so delicious and miraculously, both of my toddler boys like them! Win win!! I've had their spam saimin (big portion for the price), spam musubi & Portuguese sausage musubi, they have a delicious lulu fried rice, yummy Thai tea, good malasadas & a delicious delicious side sauce. I'll have to remember to take a picture next time rather than scarfing everything down so quickly.  All in all... it's an easy go-to. Food is always consistent and very quick delivery."}
{"text":"This food was amazing I got the BBQ combo and I loved every meat the chicken , beef , and short ribs were perfect I loved every minute of my food and that macaroni salad was so good I saved it and tried my best to make it last but I couldn't smh. I love this place and will be eating here often! Amazing"}
{"text":"I love Hawaiian food and know how it tastes like.  Hawaiian food wasnt so great. Macaroni didn't have any taster. Seafood platter had alot breaded stuff and I really didn't taste the fish or the shrimp.  The kalua pork didn't have any taste and the loco Moco the Patti was really thin.  The malasadas were ok and the tempura."}
{"text":"Another night of fast food.

Service is oddly provided when you sit at a table. 
Strawberry, Mango, Taro slush to choose from for all you boba freaks.. like me. 
Surprisingly this is the one of the few places i actually got to eat some fresh and juicy Chicken Katsu in a minute! Yum."}
{"text":"This is very reminiscent of being back in Hawaii! The mixture of portion size, creativity, and flavor was extremely satisfying! I will be making this a permanent Vegas stop. Dee-lish!"}
{"text":"Great food and fast delivery! I have ordered from here 3 or 4 times and I am never disappointed when I do. Food is always hot and fresh and delivery guy was very nice and appreciative of the tip. I always get the hawaiian bbq plate and a spam musubi. So good!"}
{"text":"Nothing Hawaiian about this place. Tried the loco moco. Meat was terrible. Eggs over-cooked. Service extremely rude. I won't even get into the ADA violations. Cardboard laid inside the door because it was raining? Talk about a slip hazard. Only thing they had going for them was the dining room was clean. Oh and there is no human being on earth that would call that brown stuff gravy. I won't be back. 3 stars because anything less is easy to delete."}
{"text":"The restaurant was located on N Decatur Blvd/215 in N Las Vegas.  I drove around the Walmart parking lot looking for this restaurant.  It was squeezed between Matress Firm and Game Stop.

This was my first time here for lunch.  We walked up to the counter.  The cashier handed us menus.  We stood there a while looking at the pictures on the menus.  The cashier said we could go sit down and she would take our order.  This was fine since we were the only ones there.

The difference between the mini plate and the regular plate was a scoop of rice.  Their menu prices need to be updated and they need a website.

The server/cashier came to the table to take our order.  We ordered the mini Garlic Shrimp plate, mini Kalbi plate, a side of egg rolls, spam musubi, Thai BobaTea, and Taro Boba Smoothie.

The Taro Smoothie came out of a machine, like the kind for a Slurpee at a 7-11.  The warm boba melted some of the smoothie.

The entrees came in To Go styrofoam boxes with plastic utencils.  I don't enjoy eating food in a restaurant out of styrofoam boxes

The Spam Musubi was the best part of the meal.  The spam was well seasoned and the rice was still warm.

My friend ordered the mini Garlic Shrimp plate.  There were 4 shrimp on a bed of lettuce with a scoop of rice and macaroni salad.  She said it was okay.

My 2 pieces of kalbi was tough and very fatty.  It was difficult to cut it with a plastic knife and to keep it from cutting the styrofoam box.

I saw a picture of Malasadas on their board.  It showed a big clump of sugar on top rather than being rolled in granulated sugar. 

This was one of the few Hawaiian BBQ restaurants that does NOT offer a military discount.  Even Island Sushi & Hawaiian Grill located in the Plaza Casino offers a military discount.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Delivery was fast, order was perfect, and the food was delicious!  Definitely ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Exciting to see a Hawaiian place open in the west area of Las Vegas conveniently located on the Rainbow and Charleston. Plenty of options, as well, including pork Manapua and banana lumpia (the banana lumpia is the highlight of the visit.) The fare is average and the Kalua pork was slightly too dry to my liking. The Portuguese sausage was surprisingly not Portuguese sausage at all but spicy spam."}
{"text":"I ordered the large Atkins plate. Lots of protein and very tasty. The chicken had great flavor you expect with Hawaiian food. Fast delivery."}
{"text":"Sesame balls are phenomenal and fresh! Lumpia was more \"eggroll\" but still delicious and filed with beef! 

Kalbi was on point and tender, not too fatty at all. Honey Katsu was unique but tasty nonetheless. 

Everything we ordered was good,  fresh,  fast, smiling employees....

I would skip the crab puffs, they weren't great."}
{"text":"Came in last night and the place wasn't too packed.  I order their honey chicken katsu which was on their specialty menu so I figured what the heck and two spam masubi.  Found it unusual that they had to find some soy sauce in the backroom but employee brought some out.  The chicken katsu wasn't that great at all so I ordered some crab rangoon to get the taste out of my mouth.  The rangoon was alright overall this place is ehhhh nothing special."}
{"text":"I've been going to LuLus since they first opened I was excited because to get food like this you have to travel out of our area. I'm writing this for people who have never tried Hawaiian food or eaten here.  The food has been consistent since day 1. Fast service, I usually get BBQ chicken plate, chicken served on sliced cabbage side of rice and macaroni salad. Typical Hawaiian plate. Also get chicken Katsu curry, it's panko fried chicken thighs in Japanese curry sauce with rice and macaroni salad. Great prices. I also get Thai tea boba it's good, a little too sweet but good. Taro boba doesn't taste a strong as other places make it maybe because it's super slushy but still good. Saimin soup is good too. And what Hawaiian doesn't love Spam. Spam musubi, spam and rice wrapped in seaweed, its an all time favorite. Good prices big portions."}
{"text":"So i order a breakfast plate and asked if i could get fried rice instead of white rice the cashier repeat my order to me. Waited about 10 mins for my food got it opened my plate to find out it was white rice. I go back to the cashier and told him i wanted fried rice he told me he cant do that i ask him why he said it not how its made. I mean come on i no u guys can cut up some meat and make fried rice easy. Why repeat my order to me if u cant make it"}
{"text":"Food is good, but we walked out after we were told to sit down then ignored as the lone waitress helped ten people who ordered at the counter.  This will affect if we ever come back.
Update: I've gone back and the key is to never sit down before ordering."}
{"text":"This review is just on the Boba tea as I haven't had the food here. 
I had the Boba Thai Tea and it was super good! I really liked how the boba didn't leave an aftertaste like you can get with boba at some other places in town. The tea was great too, I only ever get Thai Tea because I am always too chicken to try the flavors, but they had those too! 
They were also friendly so that's always a plus :-)"}
{"text":"Yum, like what I had in Hawaii. Good authentic Hawaiian food. I'm eating LauLau & Kailua pork."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out-of-town, and wanted our family to try Hawaiin BBQ, so we found Lulu's and read the great reviews on yelp, so decided to buy the Family Meal C that feeds 6-8, which was excellent and so delicious too.  Everyone was very happy and content with the dinner, which made us happy.  Such a great price too, and we have plenty of left overs to enjoy later also.  Thank you, Lulu's."}
{"text":"This has been my other Hawaiian style place to eat.  So close to home and worth every penny for wht you spend!! Very affordable with plenty of food they give.  It has a Hawaiian Chinese style mix of food.

Very yummy and very fulfilling they are very consistent and enjoy my meal every time  I go."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from here. They said there would be a 45 minute wait- they were here in about 30 min! The food showed up hot and early! Really good food. -1 star because there wasnt near enough sauce included. I would definitely order again."}
{"text":"Honey Katsu chicken was probably my favorite. Their boba drinks are always good and cold. Mango or Passion Fruit is what I choose. Service and owners are extremely pleasant and welcoming. I would stop by to eat here to grab a bite for quick buck and quick time off of any errands I was doing at the time. Service is fast and the booths are comforting. I wouldn't recommend this place as a part to hang with 10+ friends. Max would be 4-5 at the very least. Seating's are limited however, most of the time it's easier to pick up or take-out rather than dine in. Most of all you can even have them deliver to your place of home. \"depending\" on the miles away from home. I've tried their deliver home. It wasn't too bad but the food became a bit soggy and soft. Overall the service never fails to keep me from not coming back. I love the service and their food."}
{"text":"This place is mehh. Compared to other Hawaiin food places in Vegas, this one would be the last on my list. I got the chicken katsu and bbq short ribs mix plate.The bbq wasn't cooked all that great. Like it wasn't true bbq with the crust from a grill. It was more so watered down after being  \"grilled\" and just floppy. The chicken was OK, didn't have much flavor to it. The macaroni on the other hand... It was made with a heavy hand. They used way too much mayo. I also ordered spam musabi which was actually good. The customer service was nice even though I had order take out, not sure if I would dine in"}
{"text":"I spotted this place on my way to Home Depot. Hawaiian food sounded good so I figured I would check it out. The interior was clean and the food came out in a timely manner. The BBQ chicken had good flavor but the kalua pork was a bit on the dry side. Not my favorite place for Hawaiian food but it'll suffice in if I'm in a pinch."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian BBQ in town, I met the owner: Jacky,  He is  Chinese and actually from Big Island, Hawaii!!"}
{"text":"Grease, grease, and more grease. Everything is covered in gravy. The spam and eggs made me sick. Just gross."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and addicting. The honey chicken katsu is AMAZING as well as their chicken lumpia. 
Delivery is always very prompt prior to time estimated."}
{"text":"I've been a customer here for some time mainly getting their chicken katsu, spam musubi and lulu's fried rice and Thai tea, they are always good, never had an issue when it came to that. Today, I had a taste for Kahlua pork, so I ordered it. I've never had it any other way than pork with cabbage. Definitely a disappointment when I opened up my plate it was missing a main ingredient :("}
{"text":"Thought we would try this new place and glad we did!! Everything is absolutely delicious...love the macaroni salad & the spam musabi to the BBQ chicken saimin & the chicken katsu & Hawaiian BBQ mix plate & the honeydew smoothie with boba...we will definitely be ordering from this place again"}
{"text":"i ordered a loco moco and the eggs were undercooked. when i called to complain they kept insisting that it wasn't."}
{"text":"Gotta say, I was impressed with my lunch today. I went with the BBQ mix plate. A whole lot of food! Short ribs were awesome, Teri steak was good and I don't believe I've ever had the BBQ chicken with skin on, and it was crispy delicious. 

This is the first Hawaiian place outside of the islands that actually has great Mac salad! It usually the big let down for me, but not here. 

My only negatives: if in eating in, save the styrofoam and serve me on a real plate.
Issue 2: I arrived about 12:30 for lunch and device was rather slow (yet not very busy) would have enjoyed enjoying my meal instead of rushing to get back to work. 

Definitely worth the stop if your in the area."}
{"text":"So this place was decent. It's not the best Hawaiian food I've ever had, but it was passable. I didn't have some minor issues with it though. The rice in our plates were very inconsistent, some parts were cooked well and other parts were so mushy I couldn't eat it. Then the short ribs were some of the toughest short ribs Ive ever had. The chicken was pretty good, as was the seafood. And I was pleasantly surprised with the noodles, and I loved that it came with chicken on top."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for Hawaiian food near our house now. I have tried the BBQ beef plate, the fried fish plate, wonton saimin, and the honey chicken katsu. ALL so good! Every time I come here I know I will leave with a really delicious meal. My favorite part is definitely the mac salad. I always order an extra side of it! I believe it has some tuna in it which gives it that extra special flavor.

Also, the prices are so good. You can get a half and half combo of any meat and seafood for only $9.95. There are also family combinations that come with several scoops of mac salad, which I will be definitely getting next time!"}
{"text":"Great service! Even better food! My personal favorite is the BBQ Mix Plate. By far one of the best Hawaiian bbq's I've ate at. I ordered mine for pick up and when I arrived 10 minutes later it was ready and tasted so fresh! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Update:

Ordered through Grubhub and the delivery was super quick, Order perfect and Have been here three times now.  Great service, good food, very clean and plenty of parking.  I have been impressed with the customer service each time.  Price is very good for what you get.  I did try the Thai tea and when I didn't like it they let me change it out for something else with no charge.   I don't know the women's name that has taken our order all three times but she is very sweet.  I hope they stay open!"}
{"text":"I usually order Loco Moco and spam musubi but today I tried something different. Half and half Honey Walnut Shrimp and Kalua Pork. The shrimp was definitely the hero in the HWS. It was breaded just enough for the crispy outer skin but it was all shrimp. Kalua Pork was smoky, tender, and juicy. Lulu's never fail to meet or exceed my expectation. 

I would've given it the full five. But I just thought it was weird that there was some random guy sleeping in the corner of the restaurant. Either than that, food and service was amazing."}
{"text":"I have been to LuLu's twice now, the first time was due to the reviews I read and thought I would try it.  What especially enticed me was the homey walnut shrimp and that they put the same sauce on their Katsu Chicken.  I was intrigued and extremely pleased with the sauce on the chicken what a treat.  Their BBQ beef was much leaner than the other chain place for Hawaiian BBQ.  So went back second time and again got the Katsu chicken with honey sauce and the box was so full It would barely close and it was again just as good as the first time.  I can say I do prefer the mac salad at the other chain place better, so a little improvement can be made but by no means is it bad.  It is still a really good mac salad which is a must with rice and BBQ beef.  (They put my mac salad and then loaded the box with Katsu Chicken and some of the honey sauce dripped down,  what a treat.  warm mac salad with honey sauce, yummmm)

The service is exceptional.  We were greeted as we walked in and our order was taken at our table.  We received our order quickly served to us."}
{"text":"Located in a large strip mall which has a Walmart, Bank of America, Bath, Body and Beyond, and Gamestop to mention a few.  Restaurant was fairly clean.  Menus have photos so you can clearly see what you are getting.  We had the combo plate and chicken katsu.  All were good.  I would only like to see more portions of meat vs just 3 strip of short ribs.  Overall, I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"Came in to try their food and here's what I can say. If I have to rate the service on how friendly everyone is behind the counter, i definitely rate it 4 out of 5 stars but I'm here to review the food and unfortunately I have to rate it a 1 or less out of 5 stars. The Loco Moco was horrible, the patty is from a cheap frozen dinner, the only good thing about it was the egg, the price was higher than other better restaurant I've been to before. The Saimin soup wasn't impressive either. 

This is a new and young restaurant, I do hope thay make some improvement. I sure am coming back because of the service and give this place a second chance maybe in a month or two."}
{"text":"Yum. First time. Very good seafood platter with lots of pieces. The fried shrimp are delicious and the breading on the fish and scallops was not a bit greasy and cooked perfectly .Two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad came with the dish. There was enough to take home for another meal. The lovely young lady behind the counter was very pleasant and helpful.  Will come back and try another dish for sure."}
{"text":"Food was fair, I've had better for sure but there was nothing really negative about it. As far as options, this place contains all your standard Hawaiian BBQ dishes. 
The reason I give this place a three star and not a 4 is the homemade drinks that they make and advertise such as the fruit Boba.. while not entirely bad is just made in a convenient store style slush machine and contains no traditional Boba blending or natural fruit. Also the Boba was overly soft and not firm as nicely prepared Boba Balls would be."}
{"text":"I've been ordering the mixed grill platter for a while now, but recently tried their fried shrimp with curry sauce. It's my new fave! My oldest daughter enjoys the musubi while my youngest loves the katsu chicken. I will say that if you're in a hurry you should call ahead because they actually cook your food when you order it. I don't mind the wait for fresh food. The staff have always been friendly and polite. My only complaint about this restaurant is that it sometimes smells like a sewer. It's reminiscent of a sulfur smell. I'm not sure if they cook something that puts out that smell or if there's a ceptic tank issue in the building. For this reason I usually order my food to go."}
{"text":"The food is good I've had it delivered to my house a few times great kimchi ! but the cashier is rude as heck she plopped my food on the little table & I requested a refund immediately! Get rid of her lil rude self! She's toxic! I'll never go back but there's a to other ones in distance"}
{"text":"I forgot why I had not eaten here for about two years. I really wanted Hawaiian barbecue, so I passed up the Hawaiian bbq place by my house on Decatur and 215 and went here. Huge mistake! I ordered a regular bbq plate with brown rice and a regular chicken katsu plate with white rice.The brown rice was mushy and when I asked for an extra katsu sauce the cashier rolled her eyes, did not respond, turned around to get another sauce, still did not say a word, and handed me the sauce. So, of course, I am never going back! I was shocked at how rude this woman was and how bad the BBQ tasted."}
{"text":"Used to come here as our L&L replacement when they first opened when it was just the young guy and young girl working it. They were great--then!

We took a hiatus from this place after what seemed to be new management then decided to eat here after a Costco trip. The chicken katsu was good, typically. However. The menu at the time said fried mahimahi, and it wasn't mahimahi. I had to ask what kind of fish it was in which they told me it was Swai. Sorry, that fish tasted like it was defrosted then frozen then defrosted. I'm not a big fan of Swai to begin with, so I was turned off. I couldn't even finish my food. 

I started picking off my son's food in which he had the bbq beef/Teri beef. The beef was way too tough considering these are just thin slices. Flavor was all right. Also, on another trip they were offerinf this lunch special, think it was called Sweet Chili chicken, for 5.95 or something like that...it had a really weird flavor to it. The flavor was reminiscent of drinking water from a hose. There was this weird metal, tap water flavor that wouldn't go away after each bite. It looked good, the price being cheap, made it look good to try. Wouldnt order that again. 

Overall, they don't have anything on their menu that would make me say, hey...Lulu's tonight? It'd probably be the spot to-go to save a drive, and if all the kids are desperately and annoyingly hungry for Hawaiian food. Good thing they know how to hold their stomachs.

Just hate it when business acquire new management and it no longer is your favorite spot because methods and quality have changed."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a long time, but the last few times it has been - not good.  The food was bad enough the last time, I won't be back.

The ribs were all fat and gristle.  They were actually inedible.  Trust me, I am not super picky about stuff like this, but I literally couldn't eat them.  The Kahlua pork was so dry I drenched it in soy sauce and hot sauce just to choke it down.  I mixed the pork with a bunch of kimchi and that didn't even help.  The third item was the chicken katsu.  It was the thinnest piece of chicken I have ever seen for katsu.  It was tough, over cooked and it hardly had any chicken.  It was a lot of breading and a thin piece of chicken thigh deep fried.

I am sure the owner won't like this review, but this place has to do better."}
{"text":"Delicious! Spam noodles were wonderful. As was the poke and the garlic shrimp! I'll definitely be back. Oh yes and the taro boba was on point. The girls weren't the friendliest but not unkind."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here and the order came very fast and very fresh. I got the spam musubi and a combination plate. The only thing I didn't care for was the macaroni salad, unfortunately; it just tasted of mayonnaise solely. They have great prices on their Lilikoi Passion Fruit drinks as well, a favorite of mine that is generally very expensive per can."}
{"text":"I always get them mixed combination plate here it is so good and I normally hate macaroni salad like growing up I've never eaten it but their macaroni salad here is to die for I always have to get two or three extra orders of it so I can have some to eat for the next couple of days I wish I could order a gallon of it or so so I can serve it at parties"}
{"text":"Always fast friendly service great place to stop on the way home. Chicken Katsu is my favorite & super low carb plate is great choice also..."}
{"text":"This is not a bad place to stop for a quick bite to eat. The menu items individually are hit or miss, either very good or very bland. But it's very filling and the staff are always very pleasant."}
{"text":"We had ordered 1 chicken katsu plate, 2 loco moco plates, and 12 piece wonton. 

Bc of the pictures I saw posted here I told my husband we MUST try their chicken katsu! We are from Hawaii n this is exactly how chicken katsu is supposed to look lol. We did a phone order n the lady said it'd be ready in about 10 minutes. My husband went n it really was fast, he said the shop was pretty empty. When we opened our plates, it was just mouth watering! Their portions are worth it! The katsu sauce was very watery tho. Good but watery. I'm use to katsu sauce thick n that's how I make my own as well. My husband loved the loco plate n so did my kids! Wonton my kids didn't like so much. But other than that I think they did a pretty good job at local food. I wish the chicken from the chicken katsu was thicker, kinda looked like majority of the chicken katsu was just me eating panko. 


Now for the Mac salad! My husband loves Mac n Mayo. But for him to have said it was too much mayo said a lot lol. I am not a fan of mayo at all so each bite I took with rice n chicken I ate ONE piece of macaroni from the salad lol."}
{"text":"Pricey but good! Long wait time to get your good, but its made fresh, so worth it. Military discount is a plus."}
{"text":"The service is friendly and helpful  and it was delicious. This is a great local spot I would definitely recommend it to all friends and family there craving a casual delicious scrumptious meal My go to whenever I'm craving barbecue and chicken katusu"}
