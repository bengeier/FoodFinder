{"text":"Pizza and wings taste amazing, but the guy making the food and answering the phones is not nice. His jokes are border line rude. If you're super patient and just want good food, it's the place for you."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Good service. Amazing taste  We ordered over the phone. It was ready on time. Took it back home and it was still hot and steaming.   We prefer their pepperoni in meets.  The vegetarian option with spicy is good.  Wings are decent as well"}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing! I wish they had a store in new york. We ordered a pepperoni pie with peppers and also a chicken one. They were both so good! They give ranch as a side. My uncle ordered it and said there's a bit of a wait, since they make it fresh after you order."}
