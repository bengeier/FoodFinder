{"text":"If white trash food , bartenders,and patrons are your preferred atmosphere, this is the place for you . The drunken regulars will threaten to throw you through a window , and the recently paroled bartender will tell you it's not her job to serve you. To be avoided at all costs...."}
{"text":"Just disappointed just moved to the area and wanted to try the bar right across from where I would be living. Noticed they do all day breakfast only $6.99 for toast homefries bacon sausage and 3 eggs.  Now breakfast is not difficult to make even if you don't know how to cook. The server was nothing special just doing her job bare minimum is always nice. I ordered over easy eggs, wholewheat toast and my bacon super soft. The meal should have taken only a couple minutes to make. Since it was taking a little long i figured it wasn't going to come how I liked it. I was beyond right Toast was white perfect now I have to wait for the bread while my crispy bacon and over hard eggs get cold yup the only thing they got right was what actually needs to be on the plate it feels as though she brought me someone else's meal or she completely disregarded what I asked for. Breakfast is simple if you don't have a cook that is capable of making breakfast you should rethink your kitchen staff. I know now not to have breakfast here thats for sure. I might maybe come back to try something else that they are so rated well for."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in the \"beaches\"  and you have a craving to watch sports and eat some great bar food ,go to The Fill Station!  Although at the far east end of Queen St( just past the Valu Mart) it is well worth the visit.  The food is great ( also very large portions) and you can find any sport being televised from one of the 12 HD TV's.  My only comment would be that the beer selection; both on tap and bottles is lacking; but they have Guinness on tap so for me that makes up for the limited selection.  Cheers and Enjoy The Fill Station."}
{"text":"Good wings. Friendly service. Every night there's a different beer special. And they show sports. I'll be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a light lunch or a couple of beers while watching the game then this is your place in the Beaches.  It doesn't have the greatest ambiance but if you are watching a game on one of it's many HD TVs you won't care.  On my one visit (I will go again) I had a burrito which was really great.  It certainly surpassed my expectations for bar food (and was on special at half price.)   I would not come all the way to the Beaches for a visit but if you live here or are here on other business I would highly recommend the Fill Station."}
{"text":"New management has done good work--this place has gotten better. Keep an eye out for their specials!"}
{"text":"Well you either love dive bars or you hate them, and if you live in the beaches, then this is about your best bet at finding one. Food is pretty good and their daily deals on both food and drinks are typically really great value. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Sports + Beer + Good Food = The Fill Station.  A solid place run by solid guys (and gals). Always a pleasure going in there. Keep up the good work!  Half price wings on Tuesdays is a brilliant time to go. The hot wings are superb with house-made blue cheese dressing on the side."}
{"text":"Eeeeeeeeeks before embarking to my Saturday night party this was the first pit stop.  If you're wondering how far Queen Street East can go, before you get to the end you know its there when you come across the FILL STATION AND SPORTS BAR.  Though its in a quiet part of Queen street EAST/ Beaches it can get a little sketchy.   However with that being said, the place seems really chilled out, but not necessarily the best place to party.  I was here stopping by to celebrate an acquaintance's bday party on the second floor.  The decor of the place doesn't really resemble you're typical sports bar.  However the few jerseys and pictures of hanging will remind you you're in one, as you may start to question the place. The server was was kind, and was able to pour me a good drink.....amaretto sour, and a second shot of black sambuca!!!  The poutine looked really good, but the looks of this place will make you loose your appetite.... I won't be coming back here, though the food is cheap, and supposedly its good known for its breakast...hmm"}
{"text":"Been there a number of times and the portions are always large and the prices are very reasonable and the food is great.  It was amazing how well the pulled off Super Bowl sunday.  They had a full house and the staff was able to keep up without any problems.    We will be going back again... Maybe even tonight."}
{"text":"I live all the way across the city but the wings themselves are enough to keep me coming back!! The location itself is a little more convenient for foot traffic but it is a quaint little sports bar in the East end of Toronto that offers fast and friendly service paired with delicous food  On the smaller side but boasting a decent layout the place is clean with a very casual but rustic atmosphere and plenty of tv's showing all manner of sports and not just one game or event. We were  always promptly greeted and seated by our server and chose this place to begin with because of all the great things we had heard about the excellent food & service here. Tables were spacious and the booths were comfortable, the atmosphere seemed a little dark but it was actually rather nice without the blaring \"spotlight\" llighting many chains impliment into their design.  But above anything else as I mention the food is what keeps me coming back to this place. I'll admit, one of my all time favorite meals has to be good old wings and beer BUT I do not like all wings... in fact I actually like very few that I have tried but above all of them I think this place has to have the BEST WINGS I have personally ever tasted. Now although i love wings I wouldn't call myself a true wing eating champion as I was never fond of spicy things so I tend to stick to the mild but sweet, smokey or even dry dusted wings that don't pack too much of a punch. My go to sauce has always been BBQ but every place has a different tasting sauce; the Filll Station has a decent selection of sauces to choose from which I think is a big thing when offering wings.   FLAVORS: Smokey BBQ, Mild, Medium, Hot, Suicide, Honey Garlic, Honey/Hot, Curry, Tandoori, Fire & Ice,  Cajun, Jerk, Thai Chili, Sea Salt & Cracked Pepper My personal Favs are Smokey BBQ & Mild The wings themeselves are also huge, meaty and high quality... dusted to perfection and served crispy then tossed perfectly in sauce or seasoned. It's a beautiful thing :D! I have heard that their burritos are to die for as well but have not chosen anything but those delicious wings every time I visit this place!!  This is a fantastic and cozy sports bar with excellent food & service... if your looking for the best wings in T.O Look no further!!"}
{"text":"I go with Shawnte C. for the Monday 1/2 price wings. I agree with everything she says, but will add that ALL the wing flavours are awesome. I'm giving 4 stars though, because once a hockey game starts, the television audio is so loud, it's inaudible - just an ear-splitting roar. Hearing your neighbour is virtually impossible. TURN IT DOWN!!"}
{"text":"I wanted something hot, familiar and comforting for dinner on a cold, wet, icky day and I decided to try out Fill Station Bar for some bar/pub-ish food I knew would fit the bill. Even though I had a feeling I'd be able to find what I wanted on the menu (standard bar fare) I would have liked to check out the menu prior to heading out to the restaurant but my searches yielded nothing. I wasn't really feeling going out on a limb with my food tonight and Fill Station fit the bill.   The bartender was rather friendly, greeted me right away and took my order for take-out and offered me a drink while I waited. I could definitely see that if you went often enough, the staff would likely remember you. While I didn't spend a lot of time looking around, the bar is pretty standard but I think there's an upper floor with more seating (my food came via dumbwaiter, so this is an assumption). They were doing quite a business for a Wednesday night (from what I see, Monday is the night to go).  I took a seat at the end of the bar with my drink and waited for my food. And waited. And waited some more.  For chicken fingers, they took quite a while. However, I will take into consideration that they were rather busy and while I sat at the bar at least two people came up to order more wings and there were a lot of tables having wings too (which looked yum by the way). But the bartender checked in with me a few times to make sure I was doing alright and when my food came out, it was super hot and packaged rather nicely. There's something to be said about taking the extra step to line a plain old Styrofoam container with checkered paper (also keeps grease and condiments from seeping through).   I'm about a five minute walk away so I got my food home fast and even though it was cold and wet outside, my food was still piping hot. The chicken fingers were nothing incredible (sorry guys but Jack Astor's holds the #1 chicken fingers in my books!) but they were great just the same. The breading was different from the usual kind of breading I find on chicken fingers but they were very yum and just the right amount of crunchy. Not a whole lot of chicken in them but there were 5 small to medium sized chicken fingers and it was just the right portion size. Any more would have been too much. The fries were yum - not super crispy, but not intended to be; the skin-on, hand-cut style fries that I can never stop eating. I'm a \"no fry left behind\" kinda gal and unfortunately, I had to leave a bunch behind tonight because there were SO MANY.  While I felt a tad awkward sitting at the bar waiting for my food, the location and the good food will definitely have me coming back to Fill Station Bar. The service was great, very friendly and attentive (even considering I was just there for take-out)  and the food was pretty damn good. I hope to check out the wings next time or have a night out of drinks here with some buds. Seems like a good place to go out for some drinks and it'd be convenient to stumble home from :)"}
{"text":"Edit #2: Rating adjusted to reflect the downward trend in service and food quality.  I haven't been here in months without having slow service (I go here often because it's the closest place).  I'm a patient person, so I don't mind going back.  If I know I'm in a hurry I just go someplace else.  Took my parents here while they were in town visiting and again, service was slow (due to the kitchen, not the server at least).  But worse, the food was terrible.    Both parents ordered fish and chips and the fish arrived so overcooked that most people would just say it was burnt.  It was also supposed to arrive with coleslaw.  It didn't.  Girlfriend ordered a grilled veggie sandwich which was supposed to have grilled mushrooms and goat cheese in addition to other vegetables.  It had neither.  It was just red and green peppers and perhaps some onion)  Get your act together Fill Station.  If I hadn't known you were capable of 4 or 5 stars, this one experience would have been a 1 star review --- (4 Stars)  Edit: Rating adjusted to reflect recent visits to the Fill Station and poorer service received by waitstaff    --- (5 Stars)  After moving to the Beaches a month ago I've made the effort to eat at a different place at every opportunity.  That decision is now a mixed blessing.  While it helped me discover the Fill Station, for every great place like the Fill Station I visit it makes it tougher to keep trying new places that you know aren't likely to be as good.  I can't comment on the selection of beers as I'm not a big beer drinker myself, but everything else I can say is solid.  For me the biggest indicator of quality is the food (it's not like the bar is brewing the beer themselves).    Some bars will be content to offer deep fried frozen foods, and others...well, require that the cooks actually know how to cook.  They certainly know how to cook at the Fill Station.  Portions were good (my friend's wrap was so large that it was almost vulgar) and the service was fairly good as well.  While there was nothing of interest on at the time, the large HD TV screens would be great for watching the hockey game."}
{"text":"The upper level was cozy and the bar was centrw.  the food was awesome, the wings were phenomenal. Party wings versus regular wings I'm sure is a difference but their sauce is great. the staff were courteous and chill  the neat thing wad the elevator straight to he kitchen to behind the bar; a lovely touch you don't see in a lot of dive bars with personality. Monday half-price wings and $5 pints every day? I'll be stopping by here again as it seems promising."}
