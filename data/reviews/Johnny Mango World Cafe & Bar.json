{"text":"I wouldn't come back here. I've visited JM's before, and had a great experience a few years back. However, visiting here for a friend's birthday, we got the privilege of having Jen as our waitress. Not only did we wait over an hour for our food, we had parties around us sit, order bad get our food before us. I ordered a burrito, which used to make Chipotle feel like a poor man's burrito. No, my burrito was a sorry excuse for a Taco Bell soft taco. And it was $11. Jen swapped it out for a Quesadilla, which was much better. However, Jen wanted to charge me an extra $1.50 for rice. At that point in time, there was no excuse to try to charge me another buck for rice. Just make me happy. The quesadilla did come with rice, and it was very good, however the waitress left me with a very bad taste in my mouth about Johnny Mango's. I had very good experiences here in the past, but as long as JM hires and employees people like Jen, I won't be coming back to this place, ever. I'm much better off going to the local liquor store, getting a quart of Jose, and grabbing a few chalupa's say TB. This place is a sorry excuse of Ameri-Mex, especially if you want to drop a couple hundo and have a good night out with some Margaritas. I did not have a good experience, and I only blame Jen half-heartedly. There was no manager asking about our experience, and there was one trying to make our experience better. Heading home, disappointed."}
{"text":"Best margaritas in town! 
The key to this place is how fresh everything is.  All ingredients are fresh and flavorful. Can't beat any of the margaritas. Jalapeño cilantro and cucumber are two of my favorites! No mixes here. Just straight up fresh ingredients and lots of booze. Most Mexican restaurants or juice bars skimp on that aspect. Not Johnny's. 

If you aren't a drinker and just want a reasonable priced meal they can do that too!  The fried rice dishes are excellent. The steak and chicken dishes don't disappoint. Nachos and guacamole are spot on. Atmosphere is welcoming. Always seems packed but not to the point you feel trapped. Service is consistently good to great. This is a very fun place and one of my go to spots in Ohio City. 

Did I mention how good the margaritas are!!!"}
{"text":"Our group was vegan, gluten free and Paleo and we all had the most amazing dinners. Fresh real food and a great bar!!"}
{"text":"What's not to love, especially when served with a Diablo margarita?

Fresh and fantastic food for years. The only time we were let down by a brunch item, they comped our entire meal. Always friendly!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to catch brunch. Food is interesting and always good. Employees are friendly and the environment inviting which draws an eclectic clientele.  You gotta try it!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is very casual and unpretentious.  The food is simple, tasty and fresh.  There is a ever changing bean, grain, and veggie of the day, which are always good.  The miso soup is a must try.  And, all drinks are made with fresh squeezed juice.  I could just gush on and on about this restaurant."}
{"text":"I LOVE Johnny Mango!!  All their food is so fresh and locally grown/produced and everything that goes into their meals is truly wholesome and natural.  What great flavors and portions they have and what an amazing difference there is to eating 'fresh' and 'freshly prepared'!  I've been there many times and have never been disappointed.  It's quaint and quirky environment is also friendly and inviting. What a treasure for the full spectrum of appetites: carnivores, vegans, vegetarians, even food snobs will not be able to resist the charm and quality of this place! Am already looking forward to heading back there."}
{"text":"I 100% recommend the fried rice!  It comes with a lime sauce that is beyond delicious.  

I've had a burrito and phad thai, neither of which I would rave about, but they were ok.  

The atmosphere is great and quirky and their drink menu is creative and enticing :)"}
{"text":"I am a local here in OC and have been to Johnny Mangos a few times.  Up until today most of my experiences have been pretty pleasant. (minus one time I went for brunch and had the most pathetic home fries I have ever seen. And I have ate a lot of home fries in my life. The most shocking part of it, my server said this was the standard home fry they serve.) Anyways, my girlfriend and I arrived on a Saturday night around 4:30 before the dinner rush. There was still a good amount of open tables.  So we walk in and immediately we saw some friends at the bar, after about 5 minutes of talking we sat down at a table. We were never greeted by a server after about another 5-7 mins I got up and asked for a server. So the guy I asked, who ended up being our server said okay not apologizing once. After he got to my table he didn't say hi or anything he immediately said to my girlfriend. Can I get you a drink? in a snotty tone. After we got drinks we ordered our food. Took about 30 mins to finally arrive (not a busy dining room). The steak burrito I got with the big plate was just OK. Steak tasted good but there was very little amount. The tortilla was stone cold and the sides were bland. I would of sent it back but no one ever stopped over and checked on our food. My girlfriend got the veggie Pad Thai which was pretty good. 

I am just disappointed with the service most of all. The food was okay nothing memorable. Not going to go out of my way to eat there again."}
{"text":"Sign me up for any restaurant that hosts a Taco Tuesday. You really can't go wrong with a few cheap tacos and a good margarita. The tacos weren't anything particularly unique but they hit the spot. They're made even better when washed down by their Classic Margarita. You won't find any of that icky 'rita mix here--they fresh squeeze their lemon and lime juice. I haven't tried any of their menu items besides the tacos but by the looks of it, they have a variety of fresh and healthful options. If you're a vegetarian or vegan, this would be a good spot for you. I will definitely be back to try Johnny Mango's other offerings and of course, have a margarita!"}
{"text":"Wow. Really FRESH tasty food! Our waitress was right on point and thorough with explaining the menu to us first timers. She was very attentive even while attending to the whole restaurant I felt well taken care of. The food really did hit the spot it was very satisfying. I got a veggie quesadilla big plate and it was a lot of food for $10.50! Very much worth my money.Everything had a lot of flavor which is sometimes hard to do with vegetable dishes the happy beans of the day were delicious and the grilled veggies awesome. Grilled banana included with the big plate was the perfect finishing touch to my meal. I felt totally satisfied with a lot leftover for the next day! I definitely want to come back to try taco Tuesday and all the other yummy looking things they have on their menu!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. In my gym clothes, in scrubs, in pajamas with acne cream on my face. Johnny Mango takeout is always the answer to my busy lifestyle and inability to cook. Come as you are. Chelsea and Matt Dellefield are the best bartenders in Cle."}
{"text":"Johnny Mango is the best! I always get one of two items. The bus boy special is a large plate of grains, beans, and vegetables. All of which I hear are purchased from vendors at the west side market. The vegan nachos are superb. I have tried many vegan cheese options and this is the absolute best substitute to the real thing. Even my fiancé, a meat eater, loves this stuff. Can't go wrong with $4 happy hour margaritas either! Yum!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite casual, fun spots in Cleveland. I miss going to Johnny Mango on a warm summer day. I'd hit it up after rollar blading at Edgewater Park and chill out with a fresh watermelon juice margarita with a sugar rim. Ooooohhhhh YEAH! The best drink evahhhhh. 

Sigh... I miss the mango!"}
{"text":"Johnny Mango has been my favorite Cleveland restaurant for nearly two decades. Everything on the menu is delicious and makes you feel good. I love all the rice and bean combinations, and all the fresh veggies. And the chocolate triple-X for dessert is unbeatable -- not just in Cleveland, but around the world."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Despite my zillions of reviews, I don't love eating out because I know it would be healthier for me to eat at home. I just really like going out to spend time with people. Johnny Mango bridged that gap for me. I could sit at the bar all day drinking fresh squeezed juices and eating raw vegetables like I would at home, but still be out socializing. Perfect. I didn't always order salads and juice, even though they are divine, I also love the pineapple fried rice, the wraps, and everything else I've had."}
{"text":"A little disappointed with Johnny Mango...I had heard so many wonderful things about the food but that ended up being my least favorite part. My shrimp burrito basically came apart as soon as I picked it up, and my friend's Pad Thai was extremely dry. It's also a really small, kind of cramped place, and on a Friday night it was almost impossible to hear the person sitting across from me. 

However, their service is really great, everyone is super friendly, and I truly did like how healthy their menu was! It's a great place to go if you're looking to eat out and not completely ruin your diet - a lot of fresh options, and certain items (like if you order a burrito solo like me) leave you satisfied but not overstuffed.

On a less healthier note, we did order the Triple Chocolate X for dessert, which tasted like a piece of chocolate heaven in raspberry sauce.....definitely recommended :)

I think this is a great place if you're looking for a fun, relaxed environment to share some drinks and appetizers with friends in Ohio City, but for a nice date with a quality dinner, maybe not so much."}
{"text":"Reading through some of the reviews that have less-than-glowing responses, I have to say -- as a Johnny Mango fan of several years, I simply don't like certain dishes on their menu and realize that they just don't work (or at least not for my taste), but the dishes that I love and have ordered again and again really do.

My usual is the Velvet Chicken Quesadilla, which is probably the best quesadilla I've ever had.  The tortilla is grilled perfectly to be flaky and crunchy, the beans are fresh and plump, and the chicken is just delicious.  Combined with their fresh salsa, it is a little bit of heaven.  Usually I can only eat half in one sitting and enjoy the rest at home.

The Caribbean French Fries are always a favorite at my table, and make a great (and dangerously filling) appetizer.  The salsa and lettuce garnishes complement the plantains, creating a sweet and salty flavor.

The Guacamole Scoop has always been fresh and delicious, though I rarely get it because the price seems a little steep at $6.95 (last time when someone at my table ordered it, the platter was overwhelmingly full of chips but accompanied a modest portion of guacamole).  Once, the waitress was kind enough to give my table a copy of the recipe.

I think the drinks are nice, though I don't prefer to venture too far off the run-of-the-mill drink flavors, because some of my more experimental endeavors have ended up too mix-y or watery.  The cuban mojito I had was alright, the sangria is usually good, and the cipirinhas have been delicious.  Juices have been great, particularly the Zoni Beach frozen yogurt shake.

When I can fit it in, the Chocolate Triple X is a decadent choice -- modest in size but rich in flavor.

Their daily specials are hit-or-miss, depending on your tastes.  I've loved some beans but been repulsed by others.  The big plates are too much for me, and I don't prefer the grilled banana that comes with them.  I thought their Pad Thai was just okay the one time I had it.  Overall though, I always look forward to returning to Johnny Mango.

Oh!  And their rewards program and birthday coupons make for some great free and discounted meals, especially if you're a regular."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place.From margaritas to juice bar are exceptional (fresh and good). International menu with the great food option. Taco Tuesday 2$ (beans and beef) and friendly servers :)"}
{"text":"My first time there and I will not be returning! My boyfriend had had take out from there about 2 years ago and said it was good, so we stopped in for a late lunch Saturday. It was fairly busy, but that was no excuse for the horrible service we received! The waitress basically ignored us; we had to flag her down to place our order, bring a beverage we had ordered 15 minutes prior, and get our check. When she did interact with us, it was with a phony, almost condescending \"pleasant\" attitude. In addition, the food was bland and not even warm. (The tortillas were good though!)"}
{"text":"Not so great. Just had lunch there and was underwhelmed. I sat at the bar and the service was lame. The bartender should spend less time on his bed head hair style and more time learning how to show some interest in customers.

I waited 20 minutes for a Grilled Chicken Cashew Salad that was undeniably boring. If you order this, look closely for the cashews, the tiny bits of cashew are there and if you glued them all together, you would have a singular cashew. As for the salad part, well, it's a bunch of big chunks of grilled vegetables laying on top of lettuce. If you are looking for a tossed salad, this isn't it. Instead it's one of those, cut everything up and mix it together on your own. The salad dressing provided some flavor but it too was boring.

I always want to like this place and try it two or three times a year. I have yet to be impressed.

Come on Johnny Mango, take these comments to heart!"}
{"text":"Not warm, disappointed, not impressed. Slow service, slower food, not flavorful. Rude server"}
{"text":"I love this place. I eat the veggie fried rice, no egg with the happy bean-EVERYtime!  Fiery lime sauce, it never fails me:)))))"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of going to Johnny Mango's on 12/13/15 I heard how great of a spot this is especially for Taco Tuesday's from my brother but I decided to go on a Sunday.....laid by atmosphere....not a really huge place but they do have a patio....anyway I wanted to try the Laska soup ....I did....it was awesome....... I also tried the PEPPERMINT MARGARITA  can you say in love....my server Matt was awesome & very interacting something I like when sitting to choose to sit at the bar....Although we ran into a problem as we were there well over an hour before the other party got their food, mine came out quickly I need to add, so I giving them a 4 for that reason....it seems that they took care of the to go orders first and kinda forgot about the customers actually sitting there waiting on their food..... although Matt did rectify the situation and was very apologetic.....I felt it was not a good look for a first timer but because something was done I will definitely be back and hopefully this won't be an issue again......I suggest you giving them a try, it's a really cool spot to kick it at....you'll have fun."}
{"text":"The fried rice is heavenly!!! You also can't go wrong with some guacamole and chips and a pelican kiss to start off the meal!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, don't waste your time. I read some reviews and a friend said it was great. I did not receive very good service; server didn't even tell us his name. Expecting a delicious large burrito for $10.50, but the portion was quite small and the side salsa was enough for 3 chips. Definitely not gourmet and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"As an update to my last review, I felt it necessary to add that the restaurant has some new faces on staff and the service has made a huge improvement.  We have frequented the place a few times recently and the food was awesome and so was the service!"}
{"text":"They do have vegan options, yay! However the \"burrito\" is pretty small unless you get the big plate. Also to add beans for protien is extra...
The place is ok but a little expensive for what your getting."}
{"text":"If your going to have your cooks visible while cooking, it can be great to show that your clean and sanitary. But they are not, I watched them make our food, itching their body, heady, and eating the food they are cooking ALL WITH THE SAME GLOVES. No thanks I will never be back again nor will I ever recommend."}
{"text":"Nothing especial.  I ordered the tuna special it was ok but no sauce and they served with rice and beans. Probably it just me but like I said nothing special. The bartender not very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food has always been great. The staff is nice, the place is clean and looks cool. I would recommend Johnny's to friends and visitors. My only complaint  is that they only serve tacos on Tuesdays.  More tacos!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood feel and the staff does not seem to turn over that much.  Parking close is rarely a problem.  The bartender at lunch remembers my order every time and I probably only stop in every few weeks.  You do need to seat yourself and it is somewhat difficult to go with a large group as there is really only one table available.    

Excellent drinks, both with and without alcohol.  The Main Squeeze is quite good and the Classic Margarita and Mojito are both excellent.  

All of the dinners are great and I wish that they had them on the lunch menu as well.  All of the ingredients seem very fresh and always taste excellent.  I like hot food but the Jerk Chicken is sometimes even too much for me.  Also, it is possible to get the burritos with a wheat tortilla as well which not all the servers will offer you."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this very much! My food was filling and delicious. I got the Steak Quesidilla Big Plate, with a side of the veg of the day, Which was fresh corn with basil and something, and it was all good. I didn't manage to eat it all, and the leftover Quesidilla and beans were tasty cold 2 days later.

My friend got the \"margarita of the Day\" and that was delish too, though I don't remember what it was, I think watermelon something."}
{"text":"I gave j mango another try after my last visit when my drinks were warm and food was cold . I was hoping that the place I loved for many years just had an off night.

While returning with hopes for the old Jonny my expectations were quickly ruined. Our margaritas came out with close to no ice and tasted like they had been sitting on the bar for hours. Jonny mango used to have the best margarita in Cleveland hands down... Not anymore!

When the drinks arrived we ordered nachos that took nearly 30 mins to arrive.For dinner we ordered a quesadilla and pad Thai  they did not arrive for almost another hour and when they did my quesadilla was in fact a burrito we told the server we ordered a quesadilla and not a burrito and said he would have it fixed and then disappeared for another 20 mins.

In the mean time we decided to start with the pad Thai however when we bit into it the shrimp it was ice cold . When the server finally returned with the quesadilla we expressed our dislike for the pad Thai due to the cold shrimp at this time we asked for the bill bc we had been there almost 2 hours and we were still hungry. Never did a manager come by to apologize or any staff for that matter . 

Upon exiting this is when the visit went from bad to worse I went downstairs to use the disgustingly filthy bathroom and watched the cook exit the stall and return to his work station without ever washing his hands!!

Come on Jonny mango what happened to your standards and quality . Did Gary and Shelly just stop caring about you all together ??? What used to be a gem is now such a let down . I won't be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Another one of those Cleveland things I don't understand.

Think partially cooked, lukewarm veggies with a piece of hair.   And dirty glasses with specs of food.  

Two stars cause my therapist tells me I need to be an an optimist and the server was so darn cute."}
{"text":"It's just like the old saying goes: Johnny of all trades, master of none. Johnny Mango is quite good and I genuinely like going there, but I think they tend to try to cover a little too much ground and aren't necessarily able to excel at all of it. The burritos and quesadillas are good, but not great. Same for the pad thai and other Asian dishes: they're good, but not great. It's a pretty good setup when you're with a group that may want varying options, but if I want something *great*, I'd instead go somewhere that specializes in the specific cuisine."}
{"text":"Johnny Mangos is a great place to get a healthy dinner and an awesome cocktail. They also have a juice bar if you want to go the non alcoholic route. The margaritas are fresh made (no mix). You can't go wrong with just about any of the menu items."}
{"text":"The food has changed. The Bangkok Chicken was very dry and way over cooked. This was a favorite of mine over the years but tonight it was definitely not prepared correctly. The Pad Thai was good but also slightly burned. Cornbread was hard as a rock with burned edges. Great taste again just way over cooked. Drinks were great service was great. Sadly after two disappointing visits we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I always enjoy Johnny Mango! I've been here a few times with my brother, Cyrus N., his girlfriend, Chrysantha R., my sister, Sara N., my mom, Maureen N., and my hubby Joseph F. 

I love the quesadillas (I've tried both the chicken and the veggie) and the pomegranate margaritas are to-die-for! Quite strong, though - the first time I had one, it knocked me out - my friend Mike and I could not stop giggling! I've heard that some dishes aren't so great, and while the outside patio is fun, the inside is incredibly loud. It just loses one star for that reason."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I drive there from Solon all the time as if it were down the street and it's so worth it!!  They serve specials every day that are a special bean, a special grain and a special veggie. Can it get more healthy or well balanced?  The food is delicious!!  It's a very hip place and soooooo low key, which I love!!  Servers are extremely friendly and attentive. It is small so I can see how it can be an issue when it's very crowded ( I go at off times). My only criticism is this. If you go there for the healthy food, they need to focus their grains on being whole grains. For example, many times their grain of the day is white jasmine rice. Health freaks, which I'm assuming they attract a ton of, want a brown rice or quinoa, etc - anything other than white rice. That's my only critique. Oh, and don't go there for a fancy night out. This awesome restaurant is for the VERY casual!!"}
{"text":"Great food. I had the Bus Boy, which is the vegetable, grain and bean of the day. They were all delicious. My husband had the quesadilla and said it was very good. As always, service was excellent and prices reasonable."}
{"text":"I had the flank steak \"Big Plate\" and it was enough food for two people to share. Steak was really good with a perfect char. A really cool spot for a drink and Americanized Mexican food that has good flavor. It's obvious they use high quality ingredients which makes this place four star worthy."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Best margaritas in the city I have to say.  

GOOD STUFF:  Again, the best margaritas in the city.  Real lime juice makes them the best- reasonably priced as well and fairly strong.  Location is cool- nice part of Ohio City.

BAD STUFF:  Some of their food items are just so so but I've had some good stuff there as well.

PRICE:  About 40 for two with drinks.

OVERALL:  Great place for some margaritas and chips- sit at the bar, have happy hour.....good times."}
{"text":"Went to try the $1 Tuesday Tacos after reading the good reviews. Haven't tried anything besides the Tacos and Nachos and wasn't too thrilled about them. The tacos came out SUPER fast and the only option was beef taco or bean taco. Tacos weren't bad but really nothing to be raving about... The beef tacos were better than the bean ones. The nachos had too much sour cream on them and not enough beans. 
I loved the atmosphere though and think I need to give it a second try from the regular menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. You simply can't go wrong here. The fried rice is awesome. I get it every time. I recently got the jerk chicken and that has become my absolute favorite! It takes awhile to cook but is soooooo worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I have heard so many wonderful things about Johnny mango. I have a gluten allergy, so I thought this would be the best place ever to try.

I ordered a margarita and it tasted like dirty dish water. I sent it back, and the next one tasted the same way. 

We ordered shrimp pad Thai and chips/ salsa. The homemade salsa was awesome. The pad Thai, however, tasted like it had been cooking under a heat lamp for 4 hours. It was totally dry and had no flavor.

With all the hype around this place, I'll probably give it another try and order something different."}
{"text":"ok, i said the market ave wine bar was my favorite place in all of cleveland.  but i forgot about the mango.  so call me a liar.

i couldn't give you an honest opinion of the entire menu- all i know is i order the chicken fried rice every time.  it's not your momma's chicken fried rice.  there's a spicy lime sauce and some cucumber action with your rice.  

if you're going with non-alcoholic drinks, the zoni beach is the way to go.  but if you're going for alcohol...my lord, go with the margaritas.  fruity. delicious.  and pretty.
....no comment.

or the sangria.  good homemade sangria.

or if it's the summer- go with the mojito.  best mojito i've EVER had.  i actually can't stop thinking about them.

and the atmosphere is cool.  a ceiling with stars and clouds or the walls with lizards on them...many a good time i have had with buddies in the mangos.

...ah, good times."}
{"text":"I would come back for drinks and appetizers but 3 out of the 4 meals we ordered were terribly bland. Vegan nachos were delicious but both the nachos and the huevos rancheros had a side of beans that were not properly drained so food was getting saggy in a pool of water.

The juices, sodas and smoothies is what will make us go back. Delicious flavor combinations.

The pad thai has really nice flavor so I am not sure why everything else we ordered was completely bland. 

The good thing is that it is not an overpriced location like everything else in the area so you don't have to feel completely dissapointed with the blandness. 

They also serve big portions and the service was good."}
{"text":"I'm still craving the cilantro jalepeno margaritas I had a month ago!  Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Omgsh love love love the vegan fried rice! I have had it numerous times and each time I devoured it in one sitting. It's flavorful and filled with green onions, green peppers, egg plant and topped with cold cucumbers and tomatoes. I think mushrooms are yucky so I opt out on those. There's a sauce that comes with it that is just the right amount of sweetness but I don't put it on because the rice is perfect without it. I hipped my hubby on to it and now he wants to eat it everyday! I have also tried the vegan Nachos which are tasty as well. They make a special vegan sauce instead of cheese to put on top and it comes with black beans, onions, and tomatoes."}
{"text":"Visited this place last week after a gap of maybe 2 years.
Still the same below average experience.
The food is very bland overall. And they don't have salt and pepper shakers on the table either.
We ordered the vegetarian burrito big plate. Now I don't know if there is a universal definition of a burrito, but what we got was grilled unseasoned veggies inside flour tortilla.  I am not exaggerating when I say there was absolutely no salt or other seasoning in it.  The sides were OK.  I like the grilled banana.  And the slaw that came with it.
We also had pita and hummus. What we got was beyond joke.  It was one whole pita sliced into wedges  and.......a tiny sample of hummus. U know those very tiny cups for ketchup that restaurants use......that is how much hummus came with the order.  I wish I had taken a pic.
I also had their miso soup. It was very good. I loved it.
Since we had the big plate and the pita/hummus ordered, I wanted something a small side dish instead of the entree. I asked for side of beans and rice and beet salad. I got a big plate of rice beans and salad all in one plate, and got charged for their entree.  
I am not the one to make a fuss about a few bucks but this shows the reckless attitude of the servers there.
I am not going back to this joint."}
{"text":"I tried Johnny Mango the other day with a friend who recommended it.  The decor was quirky and inviting, and I liked the idea of having different daily bread/spreads, grains, beans, etc.  However, the meal was not as good as we'd hoped.

I ordered the special margarita of the day, cucumber mint, which was...not too tasty.  My husband ordered the pomegranate fizz (non-alcoholic), and we were told that they were out of pomegranate, as well as mango, avocado, and guacamole.  On a Thursday?  Ok.  Well there goes my plan to order some guacamole as a starter and/or extra avocado with my meal.

I had the grilled chicken burrito, which unfortunately was bland (even with cheese that I ordered as an extra filling), as was the rest of my plate.  It wasn't even really a burrito to me, but more like a wrap.  It fell apart and didn't have that great, warm, \"fill you up inside\" quality that all good burritos have.

We had fried tofu as an appetizer, which tasted good only in the first 3 minutes before it got cold.  This, too, had absolutely no seasoning and thrived only on the dipping sauce it came with.

The nachos WERE excellent.

My husband and friend got quesadillas, which they were pretty happy with.  My husband's mojito, however?  Another story...he did not finish it.

I didn't want to take leftovers, but I didn't want to be rude, so I packed up half my meal.  Tried to eat it the next day, and just ended up tossing it.  

I had high hopes for JM...maybe I should have gone with my friend's initial suggestion and ordered the Pad Thai, which seems to be a crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place. Best fried rice ever. Great smoothies and drinks. Awesome brunch. Can't go wrong here. And my 12 and 9 year old kids love it too. Everything is amazing. Go now."}
{"text":"A quick lunch with a friend. Never, ever order the fried rice if you are on a salt restricted diet.  Unthinkably salty to the point of ruining the taste.  Very, very nice waiter!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite finds in Cleveland! Taco Tuesdays can be busy so I would say to not only go for taco Tuesday. They have a great happy hour with amazing mango mint margaritas. I love the staff they are always running around but have great personalities! My only negative is I would say having a host at the door would do wonders so you don't have to stand at the door hoping off a table. But other then that I bring anyone I can to try Johnny mangos out."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite place to get something to eat in the entire Northeast Ohio region. I have been going here for food and drinks since I turned 21. I am now 35. Let's just say in the fifteen years I've been to Johnny Mango's, I've eaten the food at least several hundred times and every meal has been absolutely amazing. The beans.. the rice.. the fried plantain.. everything!!! it is so delicious I could probably eat this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the rest of my life and never get sick of it. Thank you for being a staple in my life!"}
{"text":"Big ups for an interesting and different space, an eclectic and lively menu, and pretty good food.  I enjoyed my pad thai, as others have, but my friend's chicken dish was only \"ehhh\".  In a part of the country where eclectic is hard to sell, and theme restaurants are often the order of the day, Johnny Mango's willingness to take some risks and its ability to deliver, mostly, is laudable.  I love this neighborhood too."}
{"text":"I'm not going to downgrade my rating, but I must say I have a pretty solid complaint. 

First, let me start by saying that the first time I came here for Taco Tuesday awhile back was perfect! We got a pitcher of the classic margarita and enjoyed our fair share of tacos. Our server was great and let us keep tacking tacos onto our bill without the blink of an eye. I'm assuming they get a lot of that: people misjudging their hunger/hunger growing as the drinks continue to be consumed. Obviously, this place can get packed pretty easily and got loud, but we were there for the margaritas and tacos after a disappointing workday, so it didn't bother us.

My most recent attempt at Taco Tuesday left me disappointed and questioning the great service I received last time. When we walked in, no one even glanced in our direction. As there was only one table for two open, we decided to wait and see if we would be seated there instead of vulturing in on it. Nothing. Nada. No smiles, no hellos, no nothing. So, someone else left and the table was right by the curtains, so we sidled a bit closer to that one as if to lay claim (there was no one else waiting, so it wasn't like we were trying to jump the line or snag a better table than \"the other guys\") and show that it could use a cleaning and they'll have some new customers--quick turnover, right? I would say this went on for 10 minutes without avail, so we left incredibly disappointed that no one even looked our direction. Not one person on staff seemed to recognize us as potential customers. I understand taco night is crazy, but with such cheap specials, wouldn't you WANT to keep those tables continually full? 

Anyways, this doesn't mean I've given up on Johnny Mango, but I will say that Lincoln Park Pub won that one and I was definitely pleased with what we discovered!"}
{"text":"Big big fan of Johnny M's.  I used to live up the street and this was one of my favorites. I can't speak for the whole menu but I absolutely loved the Chicken Fried Rice!  And I don't see any mention of dessert in the reviews ... So let me just say I'd beat a B***** that tried to take some of my Chocolate Triple X.  One bite and my eyes close and the toes start tapping.  Last but not least ... The salsa is amazing!  I would often stop in and just get a $5 (may be more now) order of just salsa to take home.  So fresh and so good! A friend of mine isn't a fan of salsa but he will go out of his way to get some to take home.  I hate that I can't get it on the regular anymore.  I miss me some Johnny Mango!"}
{"text":"Oh.my.mojitos!!!!! They have the most fantastic mojitos ever. Super refreshing especially on a hot night. The food is also awesome. They have fantastic quesadillas loaded with black beans, cheese, and your choice of veggies or proteins. The chicken burrito is also delish (ask for a side of fiery lime sauce, you'll thank me later)! If you get the combo meal (referred to as the big plate), the sides are amazing. Caribbean slaw, bean of the night, and a lime grilled banana! The banana is the surprise super star (I like them so much I asked the bf to run here and get them for me as takeout on my birthday instead of a cake)!!

Johnny Mango is our go to for dinner when we're craving light but filling deliciousness."}
{"text":"Yes their food is tasty, but if you aren't in the mood for a meal and are looking for a spot to meet friends that is funky, eclectic, and hip, consider ordering one of their fresh fruit margaritas. They vary by season and last night I ordered the blood orange margarita. It was fresh, sweet, tart, and alcoholic! 

The loaded nachos are the perfect app for your friends to enjoy over the margaritas. They are only about $7 too."}
{"text":"Johnny Mango is awesome. The food and the staff are wonderful. My first time in and I felt like a regular. Definitely a go-to spot!"}
{"text":"I give it  3 star bcuz of the neighborhood & atmosphere, as far as it being a Caribbean restaurant..... I seen one item that had jerk chicken & you could not get that until after 5pm. 
It was more of a Mexican restaurant than anything.
I went with a friend who is a vegetarian & the vegetarian section appeared to be very limited.
I ordered the shrimp quesadilla & the El Deablo margarita.
Our drinks arrived no problem but we order our main dish well before these 2 guys arrived to place a carry out order. They had their food & were out the door & probably finished their meal @ home before we ever got ours.
We finished our food & left, within 30mins. I was hungry all over again.
I probably won't go back unless I want to try their Taco Tues. & some margaritas.

As for my quesadilla I opened it like Chef Gordon Ramsey does before he eats his food & in one section of my quesadilla I had 3 shrimp & the rest was beans & cheese, the other half had 4 pieces of shrimp. It seemed kind of skimpy on the shrimp. 
I was still hungry after I left & very disappointed.
I went think I was getting Caribbean food : ("}
{"text":"So wack. Hella slow. Messed up the order. Lagged on  replacing it. Waiter was hella weak about the whole situation."}
{"text":"What do you look for in your favorite bar?  Solid, tasty drinks at a good price?  Wide range of tempting food for the empty to nearly-full stomach?  Bartenders with a personality and the memory to remember you time and time again?  Or maybe it's the fellow clientele that make the friendly, down home experience for you?  

Whatever you're looking for, Johnny Mango's has it.  Granted, I mildly insult them by calling them a \"bar,\" but I feel as though I will make it up to them in repeated visits.  

If you're a non-believer, go during happy hour on a Tuesday.  Get yourself one - ok, two - margaritas and three tacos.  Chat up the staff.  Notice everyone enjoying themselves. And then walk out with a total bill of $10 (assuming you're tipping 25% on this absurdly under-priced meal).   I DARE you to go and not want to go back every week!"}
{"text":"Theres no going wrong with anything on the menu!!!! My Dave's are the Tuna Cancuna, the fried rice and the pad Thai.... They have bomb fresh squeezed juices and bomb alcoholic beverages....... They staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is enjoyable. I like hearing people enjoy each other and good food and that's the energy in there.... They have taco Tuesday  1$ beef or bean tacos, yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been  here many times over the past few years, and must say, the food has been spotty at best. Typically rather bland and ho-hum, have had the most luck with just grabbing the fried plantains and a cocktail or three. Mojito's are not the best in town but decent. The beer list stinks. Service was friendly and quick. The juices are great but overpriced. Best thing going for this neighborhood spot is atmosphere, which is open, colorful and airy; and it's brunch- the whole wheat pancakes with sauteed apples are a favorite. If it weren't for atmospehre and it's proximity to home I'd have to take it down a star."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with another couple last night. I didn't know what to expect because the reviews were all glaringly positive or super negative, I'm glad I went.We had concert tickets that night and told the waitress we were in a hurry and she was very accommodating. The cucumber margarita is amazing, super refreshing. Made with real fruit no sour mix. Shared the guac which was super chunky, if you are into that. But needed salt. Got the pad thai which was unlike any I'd had before. While is was way too dry it had an interesting smoky flavor to it.Overall it wasn't great but it was decent, and I enjoyed myself. We didn't have to wait very long to get a table. But it was sooo loud in there and pretty hot."}
{"text":"I was there just before Thanksgiving. My mom and sister are regulars and were excited to take me here. They ordered their usuals and mom barely touched hers; it was off that day. I ordered vege pad thai, which had zero flavor. The woman at a nearby table also told her waitress that her food was flavorless. No one got to the bottom of why. 

 I asked for more seasoning & was brought sauce I was told was spicy. After pouring it on and tasting it, it was sweet and had no spices or garlic in it. I told the waitress, who asked me if I wanted another meal. It's the only thing on the menu I could eat on my diet, so I said I wanted the dish made correctly. She wouldn't take it back to the kitchen, have someone taste the sauce, or make it again because \"it was made correctly\". When she walked away, I went into the kitchen, told the cooks the sauce was tasteless and suggested they taste it. Neither did. They explained it came prepackaged and their was nothing they could do. 

 One guy gave me a teaspoon of minced garlic, which I added. Now it was noodles, garlic and sugar- which nothing can make better. 

 My biggest disappointment is that no manager was called to address the problem, I was charged for the extra sauce, no one made the meal correctly and no one took it off the bill. 

 My mom ordered her usual lg container of guac with a side of chips and opened it when we got home. She paid a chunk of money and got 2 oz of guac and alot of chips. She was really bummed that the lunch and part of dinner were just ruined. 

 Where was a manager when all this was going down and the waitress, bartender and two cooks knew there was a problem?"}
{"text":"Johnny Mango is one of my go-to favorites in Cleveland. I moved recently but visit Johnny Mango's every time I'm in town. Their Bangkok chicken is worth the wait, but I always order the Bus Boy Special (the grain, green and bean of the day) and I've never been disappointed. I'm especially excited when bok choy is the veggie of the day, it's wonderful! The guac is worth the cash and the pad thai never disappoints. Love Johnny Mango's! Ask about their loyalty program, they don't advertise it much."}
{"text":"Great choice if you are looking for a little Caribbean/tropical flare in your food.  The dry-erase board features the starch, bean, drink, and other specials of the day.  I made the mistake of ordering the nachos--not that great.  My boyfriend ordered the Pad Thai and it was really good.  The menu doesn't tell you it comes with tofu in it so if you don't like tofu, now you know.  Beware:  This place isn't air-conditioned."}
{"text":"Had brunch on a Saturday when they first opened. The restaurant was empty. Ordered a veggie omelet with cornbread and fried potatoes. The cornbread was delicious with a sweet crusty top. The omelet itself was made well but it did not have a variety of veggies, it was filled with green pepper and onions that were not really cooked. The potatoes were terrible. They were cooked with onion and neither one of them were fully cooked. They were not edible."}
{"text":"I love Johnny Mango because they have really great options for vegans, vegetarians and carnivores alike! They use all fresh, in-season produce which helps add variety to their somewhat small menu. Their vegan whole wheat waffles are my FAVORITE... try it with the pineapple granola topping, which is baked on top. Their cold pressed juices are also super delicious (my fave? Pelican Kiss). Burritos and quesadillas here are also good, however the cost can add up if you want a lot of toppings. Seating here is limited but if you get here around 11 for lunch, you'll get a spot. Great variety of maragaritas, too!"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for work, so I looked up vegan joints in town and found Johnny Mango. It was about a 15 minute drive from downtown, but worth the trek. 

Although they don't have very many vegan selections on the small menu, what they did offer was pretty good if you eat plant-based, low/no oil, like I do. 

I ordered the big plate with the veggie burrito and was very pleased. It came with a generous helping of quinoa, half a fried banana, a big scoop of beans (delicious), cabbage salad and a big burrito. 

The one issue I had with the burrito was that it was actually a wrap and it was open at both ends so all the goodies inside fell out onto the plate. I hate that! I also ordered a mango-lime margarita and it was disgusting - way too sweet, just terrible. 

However, the food was very tasty and not very oily, so I was pleased. I will return to Johnny Mango if I go back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"I like the fact that they have a variety of healthful beverages and vegetarian options.  But the inside is quite \"divey.\"  Service is good, but with it being a seat yourself restaurant I am always afraid I'll get overlooked."}
{"text":"Here for brunch w/my teenager. The grilled veggie omelet was large & tasty. The huevos rancheros was good but a little lacking...and while the cornbread is featured here, it was odd w/the huevos. Service was friendly & responsive. This place deserves a place on my regular list even though I'm an east sider."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. (but a 3 when added to my prior experience here).  We visited here on December 27 for lunch.  This was supposed to be a nice last meal with Uncle Daniel before he flew back to California. However, there was only one server and two people in the kitchen, so what should have been a quick lunch went well over an hour.  I know Johnny Mango's limitations-- their hard chairs and close tables, as well as the drafts from outside, anytime the door opens especially.  However, I didn't expect the long wait for the food, or my mom getting the wrong burrito. Phil, dad, and I all ordered variations on the Pad Thai, with me getting chicken. Daniel ordered the flank steak salad, which he really enjoyed.   Phil liked his vegetable pad Thai, though he wasn't thrilled about it. I liked mine, though I felt like there were not enough noodles.  Dad had enough for leftovers.   Mom ordered the solo burrito with beans and feta but instead got the roasted veggies, which was strange considering the server repeated our orders and checked mom's again before going to the kitchen.  At first he wasn't going to do anything about the mistake, even though the roasted veggies a a little bit more than the beans and feta.  Later, he did take it off the check, but the experience left us a little sour.

Don't get me wrong, I do like Johnny Mango, and I especially appreciate that their menus are well labeled for vegan and gluten free.  And they have such a wide variety of dishes that everyone should find something to like.  And the use of Westside Market fresh vegetables is great, as are all the great juices and smoothies.  But I felt really disappointed after this last visit.  I hope the next time I come, I will be able to report better service etc."}
{"text":"Fun, affordable and delicious. The selection of sides was constantly changing and fresh tasting. Great value for the money."}
{"text":"My experience started with me walking in the door to several odd glares in my direction. I wasn't sure if I was suppose to seat myself or what, but luckily a member of the staff kindly introduced himself and got my girlfriend and me a table.

The place isn't very big, but that's about the only bad thing I have to say. Staff was friendly and enthusiastic the whole time, and the food was unbelievable. A lot of these niche Ohio City restaurants are getting into a fad of overcharging for small quantities, which is annoying. Not Johnny Mangos. I paid around $15 for a huge plate of Jerk chicken (amazing), beans, rice, plantains, and more. I was well satisfied when I left, and will be returning again!"}
{"text":"Went into Johnny Mangos for lunch and was glad I did. Its a kind of small little restaurant and the noise level is a little high, but that's all signs of a good time. The guacamole was very good as an appetizer, very thick quac but I like it that way. The fried tofu was very good too, it comes with a sweet & sour sauce. The Pad Thai didn't have anywhere near as much spice as others that I've tried or what people have said previously. Wished is had a little more kick, but that's just me. The service was great overall, I definitely see myself stopping at Mangos more often."}
{"text":"A cute, small place in Cleveland's Ohio city area.  Offers fresh juices and Mexican style cuisine.  What I like about that place is the food is not greasy and tastes very fresh. However, I was disappointed they did not have my favorite dish the Thai noodles.  The server told me that never happens though."}
{"text":"Always love it here. We tried the Jamaican jerk chicken with the happy beans, veggie, grain and bread/slather. 

The best part? Not only is the food incredibly flavorful, but you feel amazing the next day. Healthy and so delicious. Heads up when you order either of the big chicken plates, they take 40 minutes from when you order. They are so worth it though.

Taco Tuesday -$2 is also a fun time!"}
{"text":"Vegan brunch! Finally had a chance to check out JM vegan brunch this past Saturday. We took our friend from Portland who is visiting CLE. We all had an amazing time. 
Great Bloody Mary, the vegan quesadilla was incredible! And really good pancake!
So happy to have found a new brunch spot. 
And, we impressed the Portlander ;)"}
{"text":"As usual, it was delicious! I swear I get the big plate just for the banana. I would order just a plate full of those. It's a cute little restaurant with a cozy ambiance. We went on a Saturday at about 6:30pm and we were easily able to get a table without a wait. It was my husband's first time there and he can't wait to return. Service was prompt and Johnny Mangos remains a favorite restaurant of mine!"}
{"text":"This is one of my all-time favorite restaurants.  I'm definitely missing this place now that I've left Cleveland.  I love the burritos here.  The food is delicious and satisfying, but not too filling.  And the mojitos are excellent!  I haven't ordered any other drink here.  A little pricey if you're on a student income, but well-priced if you have a regular income."}
{"text":"I like how comfy, cozy, and laid back it is.  The atmosphere is really colorful and vibrant.  I also like how they serve both Thai and Mexican food there.

I got the pad thai there, which wasn't too amazing.  It had a good flavor to the pad thai, but the sweetness was missing.  The shrimp was fresh and firm to the bite.  It wasn't spicy either, which can be the case in some pad thais.  I've had better.  

I really like the beer selection, they have a wide variety of Mexican beers and a few Asian ones as well.  I really enjoy Pacifico beer it was lightly citrus-flavored (chick beer if you must).  The IPA is good, just not the best IPA I have had.

It's good for late night eating, but nothing too special or exciting..."}
{"text":"We had only been here previously for drinks while waiting for a table at Momocho, so  we decided to come back for food. We came for brunch since they seemed to have a pretty good brunch menu. Seeing the huevos rancheros on the menu basically decided our brunch spot for us. The rest of the brunch menu seemed to have your standard options- omeletes, waffles, etc. 

We chose to sit outside, as it was a gorgeous day. It took a while to get service, as we had to seat ourselves (that was kind of weird). For appetizers, we got the guacamole and salsa, and it was good. Your standard guac and pico. The guacamole needed a bit of salt, but that was a quick fix. 

For the main option, we both got the huevos rancheros. I was so excited for this, but it was such a let down. The corn bread and the black beans that came with it were perfect and delicious. However, the main attraction was not good at all. My sunny side up eggs were too overcooked, and the yolk barely ran when cut. The entire thing was bland, and the ranchera salsa seemed like it was just blended tomatoes and peppers with no seasoning. I didn't even want to finish it after a few bites :(

Probably won't come back here, unless it's for dinner or something else. The menu looks eclectic, so who knows!"}
{"text":"Our favorite go-to spot. Get the pad Thai or chicken thighs, with a kale aid or margarita to drink."}
{"text":"This vegan-friendly joint serves up 'world cuisine.' They have vegan tacos, burritos, pad thai, as well as, made other specials and small plates. One of my favorite things about the menu is the wide variety of fresh-squeezed juices!

Johnny Mangos is certainly on my Top 10 vegan-friendly place to try in Cleveland!
http://veganhostess.com/vegan-cleveland-restaurants-coffee-shops-more/"}
{"text":"Great vegan and vegetarian options, as well as gluten free. Excellent spritzer and smoothie selection. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Food is always VERY fresh and full of only things you want in your body. They don't over dress their food, they just give it to you the way you want it. I really like the simple aspect of how amazingly tasting the food is. 

The Pelican Kiss. Just a juice drink. Cranberries, Apples and Ginger. But it is AMAZING. it tastes like something wonderful. But simple. 

Every time i go I order the Burrito with Chicken and Cilantro Dressing.  It has tomatoes and lettuce.  Like I said, simple, but the cilantro dressing is fantastic.  

I LOVE THEIR NACHOS. SO AMAZING. FRESH AND SIMPLE BUT AMAZING. Great to share when you aren't too hungry but still need food. 

It seems like nothing is processed. once we got margaritas And my friend said they weren't fruity enough, so she asked for more raspberry sauce for the drink, expecting the waitress to go dump more some thing from some bottle into the drink. She came back with a cup full of FRESH crush raspberries. And said sometimes when they add the fresh berries they sink to the bottom and its good to add more. I was so happy.  

This place is amazing. I think its a wonderful hang out bar as well. Good community feeling."}
{"text":"The Menu is lame and not very inspired. For a \"veg\" friendly place, why don't they use organic eggs? While the Cajun \"fries\" were good, they were most certainly not fries but baked, large, plantains. Perhaps that should have been specified on the menu? The Pico was awesome and actually had a kick. No complaints there. 

I do have to say I have never been to a place where I was handed a big, heavy-duty flashlight to take with me to the ladies room. Good thing though, 'cause man, it was dark down there! 

Eh, I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Johnny mango hits all the points. Great food, great drink, great service. Expect the unexpected when you come to this neighborhood favorite. It took a few minutes to settle in to the noisy atmosphere, but a pitcher of margarita helped take the edge off and ease into the surroundings.
We were taken off guard when asked to move from our table because it was about to get busy and our 4 top table would be a valuable commodity, but that is an afterthought once we adjusted to our new 2 top and the food came out. That's when it all came together. It's must have been the moment when the first bites were taken and the margarita had reached its apex in our bloodstream, cause that's when it became clear. Johnny mango is just plain good food the way god intended it to be, fresh, natural, cooked to perfection with no artificial ingredients or accoutrements to smother it all with. 
Yes, that's when we realized how this meal had transported us to our visits with other countries where they cook in the same vein, and it's just damn good natural organic regional food. That is what happened in johnny mango that afternoon. We felt we were eating a quality wholesome meal in Costa Rica or a remote island someplace. 
Then we took in the local patrons and could see evidence of world travelers among us, like us. Some  of the younger ones go all out with their earrings, plugs, bracelets and cultural shirts and dreads, but we could read the older ones too, like us, had flair of our own travels abroad worn proudly as well. Just more subdued. A single cultural bracelet, a single long necklace with amulet, one ear with multiple piercings. This is when we realized why they were there too, with us, in that place that day. They all get the feeling when they come here too, the feeling of being transported. Nice job JM!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and it was definitely worth the wait. On the recommendation of our amazing server, I tried the Laska soup, vegan style. It was absolutely delicious. Just enough curry to give it a slight bite, the coconut milk added just the right amount of creamy to the veggie broth to bring comfort on a cold day. I got the vegan nachos to go, because I'd been dying to try them. Even eating them later, they were great. I can't wait to go back and try more. I'm a huge fan."}
{"text":"Okay, it saddens me to have to write this review because I honestly wanted to love this place. We had heard great things and the reviews were mostly impressive so we were really excited to eat here. Sadly, it didn't live up to the hype today. I will say on a positive note, it has a really nice neighborhood casual atmosphere, their food is cooked in a healthier way than most restaurants, and they make their juices in house which are delicious! Highly recommend trying a juice if you go.

Unfortunately, today, the food and service just didn't do it for us. We got the pad thai and the huevos rancheros. The pad thai had a nice tangy flavor and wasn't overloaded with oil, but overall wasn't very impressive and needed some more vegetables to jazz it up. The huevos rancheros had minimal flavor and had egg shells in it. Lastly, the service was fine but nothing to write home about. Our food took about 45 minutes and while she did update us once which was appreciated, we were hardly checked on after.

Like I said, I wanted to love this place and I will absolutely be giving it a second chance (will update the review after), but today was just a two star performance."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Cleveland! My recommendation is to get the Caribbean french fries appetizer and then the Pad Thai or Fried Rice for the main course.  So many flavors and is great for vegetarians and meat eaters! The atmosphere is always super chill and laid back and it's located in the trendy Ohio City area.  Oh and I almost forgot to mention Taco Tuesdays! What more could you ask for"}
{"text":"If you're craving some healthy, feel-good food with a little island flair, Johnny Mango is the place! Lucky for me, I live only a short walk away. We stop by here often and grab carry out on nights I don't feel like cooking. 
The food is always fresh and flavorful, and my boyfriend and I have eaten through much of the menu. My go-to's are the miso soup (add extra greens!), the pad thai (so much food and so delicious), and the bus boy special (their daily selection of grain, bean and vegetable). My boyfriend pretty much swears by their burritos and quesadillas. They also have a great selection of fresh squeezed juices that are oh-so-delicious. 
Tuesdays are a great night to stop in for their $1 tacos. And they have a killer brunch menu. Vegan waffles anyone?! Its always busy, so I can't be the only one."}
{"text":"While a tad pricey, Johnny Mango's eclectic collection of east meets west cuisine seems to have been imported from the west coast.  But, being an import means that what might seem common on one coast, may be quite different on another.  

My visit was on a crisp spring afternoon with relatively prompt service, a pitcher of Sangria and glass of Caperinha.  I like their caperinha more than Brasa's, but less than Sarava's.

I also had their Pad Thai which left me pleasantly surprised.

It's not haute cuisine, and the attention to detail in the food probably doesn't justify the price; nevertheless, it's a pretty fun place to eat and relax, and the food was passing fair..."}
{"text":"Went here around 2pm on a Friday afternoon. I had a taste for Mexican, and we were both craving their jalapeno margaritas, so my boyfriend drove by Barrio in Tremont, but they were closed until four (I believe). So instead I suggested Johnny Mango's, as my sister always raves about it and I was in the mood to try someplace new. 

The service was friendly and super laid back, which I don't mind.
 
I was instantly impressed with the selection of fresh-squeezed juices, so I got a Kale-Aid and slurped it right down like a happy kid. My boyfriend was surprised to find that they, too, had a jalapeno margarita similar to Barrio's. He had two, and was also content drink wise. However, Barrio's is spicier. Bordering in between hot and too hot. This one was mild. Someone who prefers milder spice levels may prefer the margarita at Johnny Mango's. I prefer the salty-sweet heat of Barrio's. 

As for the food, I got the big plate with a chorizo-potato stuffed burrito, and my boyfriend got the big plate with a steak quesadilla. It came with beans, rice, a tangy/crunchy slaw, and a fried banana. I've never enjoyed a banana so much in my life. I will say that the quantity of meat in my burrito was sparse, and a lot of the reviews on the burrito are quite accurate (some said it seemed like it was more like a wrap, and some said it wasn't \"filled\" like a traditional idea of a burrito). My boyfriend's quesadilla was much more delicious. I won't get the burrito next time, but I'll definitely be back to try something new. 

If I had any complaints, I will say that it's slightly overpriced for me, personally. At roughly 11 bucks for my plate, I wouldn't make a habit of going there as I would for example, Chipotle, for 7 bucks."}
{"text":"This Ohio City eatery is fun and vibrant. Atmosphere is extremely casual. The \"worldly\" cuisine is healthy and delicious. Full bar is available -- as are an assortment of fresh squeezed juices."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times, and despite the amazing ambiance, my experience + food has been just a-ok.

The biggest plus is the environment. There's a lot of energy here with some cute decor. To enter the restaurant, you pass through a heavy curtain into a dark interior with brightly painted walls and decorated tables. It can get pretty loud, which can be a pro or con depending on what type of dinner you're trying to have!

Johnny Mango has a pretty eclectic menu. They shoot for healthy + organic food (possibly local?) and while I appreciate the freshness, I don't quite connect with some of the flavors. It tends to be a little more on the acidic side. I always end up going for the veggie burrito, which I always forget is merely a veggie wrap. They offer different sides with the big plate each time, and the quinoa + legumes were okay. I think my favorite part is always the beans and the caramelized banana. 

I've never had drinks here, but I hear those are worth ordering. Also, I keep hearing about taco tuesdays which sounds AMAZING, but it's hard to get a seat! Maybe I need to try harder..."}
{"text":"Johnny Mango is a great place for a fun, casual atmosphere, healthy food choices (highly vegetarian-friendly; great juice bar) and tremendous bang for your buck.  I consider it a very good first-date place as long as your aim is to break the ice more than to sweep them off their feet.  And what you really need to know is: Bangkok BBQ Chicken.  It really does take a little longer to arrive, as they mention on the menu, so if you're hungry get some chips and (great) guac or salsa while you wait - but it is one of my top 5 dishes in Cleveland at any price, and a steal at $15."}
{"text":"Last night, JMs accommodated my last minute request to seat 10 people. We were arriving within the hour on a Friday night. And they did so with a smile and excellent service. I'm sure we were annoying with our seperate checks and sporadic arrival and indecision. But our server was fantastic. 

As always, food was delicious. I had the Pad Thai but the burritos also looked amazing. The daily specials are always unique. The menu is well rounded and will suit vegetarians, vegans, carnivores, and everything in between. (Which is why a group of 10 agreed on JMs.)

Margaritas. What can I say except get a pitcher. And call a cab."}
{"text":"I've never been to this place, but I have a difficult time believing it's in Cleveland based upon the reviews.  That must count for something!

That plus the fact that a dear friend thinks of this place when she hears the word 'mojito'  These two things are certainly worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"Originality is a 5/5 stars. Service was great and the food came out pretty quick. First time there so the waitress walked us through the menu and recommended the Pad Thai and Fried Rice. We went against the recommendation and that could be the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. We had the nachos and guacamole as appetizers, which were great(5 stars on those dishes), the chips were salted perfectly and the right amount of crunch. I ordered the Flank Steak Big Plate which was very average, ordere the steak medium rare and it came out more like medium well. The steak wasn't anything impressive, but it was good, sort of chewy. Then the sides on the dish were also very average tasting. Overall I enjoyed the meal, I would come back again but I would be sure to stick to the waitresses recommendations."}
{"text":"Vegan nachos, fried plantains, margaritas! It's amazing! Great happy hour deals, the service could be a little bit better but it's not horrible. It can get pretty noisy in here, and there seems to be a lot of regulars which means it is good for consistency. Everything tastes fresh and seasoned to perfection. Their smoothies are some of the best I have ever had, and their outdoor patio is perfect for a nice spring or summer day.  Very large variety of food. It's a must stop if you're in Ohio City!"}
{"text":"Johnny Mango has been around for a while, and is definitely worth a visit or two.  It's got it's up-sides, and it's down-sides...

THE UP-SIDE:
Pretty tasty food with a lively, hip atmosphere.  The servers are always friendly.

THE DOWN-SIDE:
This place has a tin ceiling and is thus, really, really LOUD!  Don't go here on a first date, or any other occasion where you might like a romantic and quieter atmosphere.  Seating is always limited here; expect a good wait on busy nights.

THE SUM-IT-UP:
Check it out when you're hungry and in the mood to have a lively, fun time with a group of good friends."}
{"text":"So I felt I needed to review this restaurant based on my experience today. 
Me and my boyfriend are visiting from Miami FL where we are spoilt for choice when it comes to caribbean, vegan, modern, you name it... food. My Uncle, a Sandusky native, took us here as he'd heard good things (and Momocho's, the restaurant I wanted to go to, was closed on Mondays). 
Good impressions when we walked in, friendly atmosphere, diverse crowd, lively decor, and a great smell of fresh ginger and cooking. We sat ourselves, ordered our drinks, 2 smoothies and a watermelon Margarita which all tasted great.  (the only reason you get one star)
The food seemed interesting on the menu and reasonably priced, and there was daily specials, happy beans - pinto beans, grains - jasmine rice and veggie  - asparagus. 
I ordered a grilled chicken big plate burrito, my boyfriend ordered the skirt steak, and my uncle, the shrimp fried rice. We also ordered guacamole to start. Our server was a young man who seemed pleasant at first.
guacamole and drinks arrived promptly. guacamole was fresh but lacked a kick or seasoning, it had no heat and the chips were really salty. 
thirty minutes later we had not received our main course, and the restaurant was not all that busy. The waiter seemed to be avoiding our eye contact, and when we finally caught him, we asked him if he could check on our food. He walked up to the kitchen area, which is all in plain view, didnt say anything to the chefs, then proceeded to walk off finding anything to make him look busy, without returning with an update on time- a simple, \"its almost ready\" would have sufficed.
10 minuted later and it finally came. 
Looks were deceiving.. It looked great, colorful and plentiful however a first bite of the beans revealed a complete lack of seasoning and flavor - ive had canned beans taste better.... We called over the server, and as he say us, i read his lips say \"oh jesus\" and a slight roll of the eyes. He arrived at the table, and I asked him for some salt and pepper, which was not present at the table. My boyfriend asked if they had Tabasco, to which he responded \"no\" with an attitude. I am not quiet by any means when being disrespected so i said out loud in front of him, \"how rude!\". That must have made him think because when he returned, his tune had changed completely, now with a sudden interest if there was anything else we needed... too little too late.

My chicken burrito was bland.. no spice, no seasoning, no mayo or any type of sauce, just a dry, poorly rolled burrito which was not properly tucked in at the ends to stop the contents from rolling out. The slaw tasted like cabbage with vinegar on it, and the \"jasmine rice\" was actually just white rice.. i can tell the difference. My boyfriend said his was just as bland as mine, while my uncle seemed to enjoy his fried rice. 

Long story short, The service was awful, long wait times, bland food. Nothing about this restaurant was remotely caribbean! Smoothies were great - skip the food and just go for that! I dont know whether we are spoilt with high expectations coming from such a rich culture as Miami FL with many diverse great restaurant, and I have noticed a lot of people in OHIO seem to like the bland tasteless food some of these restaurants sell, but I have taste buds, and this doesnt cut it for me! Not for an $80 meal either!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by for $1 Taco Tuesdays and I must say it was perfect. Cheap small tacos with real ingredients, and delicious margaritas. 

Go and you probably won't regret it ;-)"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday - but we did a couple of salads. A grilled steak salad and a grilled chicken breast salad. Good reviews on these salads with some excellent house made dressing. 

I had the chicken fried rice. Interesting but not the best I've had. 

The place is very interesting locals of all ages. A full bar. My wife loved the sangria. Friendly servers. It's worth a visit when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"DRINKS. The only reason to visit Johnny Mango. The mojitos are always strong. The sangria? Refreshing and delicious. The margaritas? YES! ANOTHER PLEASE. 

The food? Yawwwn. ZzzzzzZzzzz. Someone wake me up.

The service leaves something to be desired.

I used to frequent the downtown Willoughby location. It wasn't open very long because it was even worse than the original location. I had a lemongrass soup there once and it tasted like some sort of household cleaner. 

If it weren't for the lovely drinks I'd give this joint 1 star. I know, I know. You could get drinks like these anywhere... I'm TRYING to be a tiny bit nice here."}
{"text":"We went at noon on a Sunday-we got sat right away. That was the highlight of our experience. We ordered 3 waters and got 1....ten minutes later. We ordered our food and after 45 minutes, cancelled the order because our server told us \"the kitchen is backed up.\" There is no reason for a wait like this-the largest table was maybe a 6-top, something a seasoned wait staff can manage. Maybe they need more servers...or less tables. This was not my first time here, but definitely my last."}
{"text":"First things first. Johnny Mango has the best margaritas in Cleveland, hands down, and I consider myself something of a professional when it comes to those deliciously tequilla-filled beverages. The regular lime ones are good, but they also have flavors like watermelon (seasonally - and my favorite), cherry lemonade and cilantro jalapeno. And not only do they taste divine, they pack quite a punch! After 2 of those, I'm feelin' pret-ty goooood. Especially if I selected the \"El Diablo\" that day, which includes vodka in the mix. And with margaritas only $4 during Happy Hour (down from the usual $6), your wallet will thank you.

Other than that, the food accompanies the drinks quite nicely. As many others have said, you can't go wrong with Taco Tuesday's $1 beef or black bean tacos. I started out always getting beef, but have switched to the black bean, slathered in sirracha...mmm! One tip - add jasmine rice, or the \"grain of the day\" for a buck or two, and you have a pretty hearty meal for hardly any money. They also have amazing pad thai - and even though I'm a meat lover, I would suggest the vegan or vegetarian, which are both chock full of veggies and savory sauce. Also, the salsa, guacamole and chips are all tasty too.

Let's not forget the atmosphere and service, which are great too - hence the full five stars. Billed as a \"World Cafe,\" there is a hip, relaxed vibe inside, complete with a starry ceiling. In the warm weather, I love to snag a spot on the small patio outside and people watch the surrounding Ohio City neighborhood. Or once in awhile I'll sit at the bar alone to order takeout, sipping a margarita and chatting with the friendly bartenders while waiting for the food to be ready. All-in-all a great and friendly place.

Last but not least, one of my favorite features is the Passport Club. After signing up and getting your card, every $200 you spend earns you a $20 gift certificate. I just kick myself when I forget to use it!

Thanks for being one of my favorite places in Cleveland, Johnny Mango!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Johnny Mango is really nice. The mixture of the banging of the kitchen, Ohio city conversations, and fantastic music makes for a eclectic atmosphere. However, the appetizers I ordered were average at best. The guacamole was very bland. No salt, peppers, lime and I have no Idea why people put tomatoes in guacamole. Fried Tofu, again no flavor at all. The best thing was the plantains were good, especially when you add the sweet and spicy sauce to it. I'll come again, hopefully the entrees are better."}
{"text":"We visited last week after remembering fondly great meals here.. Not the case.. Greeted by a flustered and unfriendly server on the patio. My margarita was the only bright spot of the meal. He forgot a drink for our table and seemed annoyed that we reminded him about it (after food had arrived ) guacamole and salsa average served with what tasted like Tostitos chips. 2 quesadillas were dry and tasteless. Sorry to say, this longtime Ohio City spot has lost me for good. At least get either service or food right! Without one or the other I can't justify coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm usually extremely skeptical about restaurants (especially casual ones) that mix different ethnic foods, but Johnny Mango's does a great job.  They don't claim to be or try to do ethnic foods authentically.  Instead, they use key flavors of certain cuisines and put their own twist on it.  I can't get enough of the fried rice and the pad thai.  yum!!  This place is perfect for hanging out with friends on a summer night with a pitcher (or two or three) of margarita's.  And even though the outdoor seating is nothing more than a gated area on the sidewalk, it is a fun place to relax and people watch.
A caveat - the service, while really friendly, is pretty slow.  This is not the place to go for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend of mine for their $1 Taco Tuesday night. We ordered their margaritas which was uberly divine. I had their mango and my friend had their cucumber one. Both tasted great and as far as the tacos goes, we ordered their beef with tomatoes and guacamole. The meat was moist but it wasn't really tasteful to me so I had to add in some hot sauce. So a better job could be done here. 

As far as the place goes, it's small and it's got a full bar area upfront and a few tables. It's festive with some really bright colors which makes it a wonder for the place to light up. Their roof is like looking at some stars at night. Located by Ohio City, the place was fairly easy to find. The only other thing which is kind of a downer is that the place is pretty cramped so you may be sitting close to others so it may seem claustrophobic for some. As far as their menu, they have tacos but you can also order some pad thai and fried rice. I like how it has a twist of some Asian dishes but not sure if it should go together though. Service was great and we were paid attention for all the appropriate times. 

I'd come again with some group of friends but be careful during the nighttime because the place can get a bit sketchy."}
{"text":"Followed Cara L's advice and ordered the Calypso (went for the large) with steak and Lime Peanut dressing to go.   The steak was cooked perfectly as ordered and ready at the promised time. The attentive barmaid happily recommended the Kale Ade which was juiced fresh when I arrived.  As a first \"fresh juice\" experience,  the drink was refreshing and tasted great. This worldly experience is definitely worth repeating."}
{"text":"I have pretty much eaten everything in their menu!! Everything is amazing!!! Great margaritas! Best fried rice around!! Bus boy special is always fresh from West Side Market! 

Can't beat their $1 tacos in Tuesday's!"}
{"text":"Ohio city has a ton of choices when it comes to variety cuisine, johnny mango's world cuisine is a must try. Service is fast and courteous. Lot of vegetarian and vegan options. Prices are very reasonable including their cocktails. The food is not spicy. it is tasty. Fried rice had a smoky flavor. The Jamaican jerk chicken was grilled to perfection obviously could have used a little kick.  Sriracha sauces are available on the table. Worth the visit and the options will want us to try them again."}
{"text":"man, another let down of a restaurant in Cleveland....we've been stuck in a rut of the familiar for a little while and are trying to expand our list of places we frequent, so, cue the \"try a new place with mixed reviews\" music.

Stopped in here on a Tuesday night after our boathouse practice looking for something light and refreshing.  I've heard good things from several people (a few negatives too though) and figured since we were kind of in the area to give it a go.  Walked in and stood around for a while....and waited, and waited some more, finally wound up asking some of the other patrons if there was a host/hostess that would seat you, they weren't too sure either.  Finally caught the eye of the bartender who said we could just seat outselves at the one open table...ok, thanks dude.  Is it so hard to put up a sign saying \"please seat yourself\" if you choose not to have a host?  Makes it a bit easier for people who have never patronized your place before.

Both of us work early in the morning, so alcoholic drinks were out (even though I probably should have had one judging by what everyone else says about the margs), I got the Pom Fizz and my better half got the Mango FIzz, both were quite good, I thought the Mango one was better after trying both, just seemed to have a nicer blend with the lime flavor.

Decided on a couple apps and a quesadilla.  Got the guacamole and the fried plantains.  As least the chips had salt on them because there was no seasoning in the guacamole whatsoever....I mean, I can mash up an avacado just as easily as the next person and that's what basically came out to us.  Bland, boring, would never order it again, is it so hard to throw in a little cilantro and maybe some lime juice and hot sauce?  Fried plantains were actually pretty decent, a little larger than what I'm used to being served in the Carribean (usually they cut them a little smaller), but very good nonetheless.  However, the pico de gallo they served with it didn't really mesh all that well, they should probably come up with a different sauce for the dish.

Chorizo and potato quesadilla with mild peppers added in there....to be honest, all I tasted were the beans...was there even any cheese in this thing?  I mean, I know beans are cheap, but get something else in there too.  And, once again, needed to be seasoned.  The quesadilla itself broke apart while eating, it seemed almost brittle, like they used stale tortillas or something.  I could make better at home.

I dunno, I think this restaurant will probably continue doing well due to their drinks, but I probably won't bother coming back because drinks just don't do it for me if the food isn't good as well....at least it was cheaper than roseangel.

Although I DO have one question.....can someone explain to me what exactly they are trying to go for?  Are they a Mexican restaurant?  Caribbean that serves pad thai?  A juice bar with food?  I was slightly confused by the menu options....meh, the search continues for restaurants to add to the rotation...."}
{"text":"Ohio City's most creative and fun restaurant for the past seventeen years. The service and staff are not only top notch but are a blast to interact with. The special board always changes with delicious selections and you can't ever go wrong with any of the pad tai's... Throw a couple coconut mojitos in and I promise your night will be fabulous..!"}
{"text":"Love love love their pad Thai!  The first lime sauce is the best   just wish it was a littlè bigger"}
{"text":"Johnny Mango's is my favorite place in Cleveland. It is only fitting to write an update, since my first review was almost 5 years ago after I had just moved here. 

Since then, I have come to love this place. EVERYONE is friendly. You can go by yourself (as I often do) and not feel out of place. The fellow diners are generally fun; rarely do you run into a-holes. There are so many reasons to love this place, I can't even count them. And I've had to take four freaking stats courses.

It's more than the drinks and the food: 

1) It's the chef realizing you've never tried the BBQ chicken and insisting that you share HIS dinner in order to finally try it. 
2) It's watching baseball with Jimmy at the bar in July. 
3) It's people of all shapes, sizes, colors, sexual preferences, political affiliations and economic standings sitting in one place and talking about the community. 
4) It's picking up food to go, and ending up staying there for an hour due to the great conversations and company.
5) It's definitely a place for carnivores, but has the best vegetarian/vegan food in the city. BY FAR.

It's loud, but it's intimate, it's stylish but eclectic, it's got one small TV but manages to be a great sports bar. It's a great, great place on that funky little corner of Cleveland."}
{"text":"I have been to Johnny Mango a handful of time for brunch, lunch and dinner. Each time I have dined here I have just felt that the food was just OK nothing to write home about. The drinks are usually pretty tasty. And they have daily menu and drink specials as well as monthly specials. I live in Ohio City so its not far for me to dine here at all.. I can walk. But I would not come from across town to dine here; its nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Fresh, flavorful fare and good service consistently.  This place can fill up on busier nights and the servers are typically running their butts off to make sure everyone is well taken care of.  I feel like now that I know what to order here I love it even more.  My go-to's are: pad thai, velvet chicken quesadilla with a side of guac, Caribbean fries (plantains), steak fried rice and the miso soup with the additional sprouts. They offer \"big plates\" which live up to the name and could feed a small army.  Their margaritas are the best in Cleveland because they use fresh juices. There are vegan/vegetarian options.  The crowd is always diverse and cool.  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Wonderful. Vegetarian if you want it, but plenty of meat around, too. I love the big plates. Huge portions of healthy, well-prepared, simple, fresh food. Great (expensive) juice drinks. Great Pad Thai. Go here. One of the best cheap restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is the best place ever!  I could eat there everyday.

 I LOVE the following:
1) Pad Thai. 
2) Quesadilla's with sprouted wheat tortilla, black beans,  feta, artichoke, homemade chipotle, tomatoes instead of pico (hate onions), and avocado. 
3) Freshly made margaritas, particularly: Mint Mango, Cucumber Mint ( I coined this one), Watermelon (seasonal), and Blood Orange (seasonal). Careful, they go down rather quickly.

It's awesome you can earn Mango Points. After earning I think $200, get $20 back. 

The atmosphere is very cozy and upbeat. The staff is diverse. The total opposite of a chain restaurant. Rumor has it the place is haunted as well but I have never seen anything. The basement is a bit dingy where the bathrooms are but it has character!

I HAVE LITERALLY THOUGHT ABOUT FRANCHISING THIS PLACE!! 
Maybe one day. I miss it dearly."}
{"text":"OK food (not sure how healthy though), great margaritas and sangria! I have only set outside and I found the patio on the sidewalk quite charming."}
{"text":"Short and sweet.
I have never had anything but tacos and nachos here becuase I am cheap and have only been here on Dollar Taco Tuesday. 
The tacos are general tacos, nothing special. The margaritas are suberb though. Lets me serious, thats why I have gone there. I want to try the other food, it looks tasty. 
The bathroom is a journey and always really warm. 
Thats all I got."}
{"text":"Dank ass juices

Healthy options

Excited to return

{"text":"Johnny Mango is delicious! I love the food, the staff, and the atmosphere!  The food is all made to order fresh! One of my favorite aspects of JM'S is the open kitchen. It's fun  watching other people cook in a real kitchen! Who doesn't love it! Any night this place is good. #ConsistencyIsKey"}
{"text":"Had a couple of drinks and ordered food.  Everything was just okay, nothing out of this world and unique.  The Mojita was way to sweet for my standards and the chicken burrito fell apart after a second.  But the positives was good service and quesadilla was good.  Their $1 taco Tuesday's special is unbeatable in the area.  Overall, a 3 star will do.  Thanks Johnny Mango's."}
{"text":"Small place with big flavor. I had the burrito and big plate. It was full of flavor not overwhelming. They sweet, salty and spice mix was great. The coleslaw and beans are amazing. The one bartender was nice and good but seemed little busy to be by himself.  The margaritas and the mojitos were fantastic too. We also had the Caribbean chicken , plantains and nachos. We're not shy we love to eat.  Parking sucks but it is Ohio City."}
{"text":"I would have never thought to try the Pad Thai Noodles at Johnny Mango but I am glad that I did. Very good and I would recommend if you enjoy this type of food. The place is small and is usually busy so plan ahead. The kitchen is even smaller and I was surprised how two cooks can produce such a variety and volume  of food in such tight quarters. Impressive!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Where to start...Well the drinks are really good, Margarita's are a specialty of the house. The food is fantastic, my favorite is Chicken fried rice, I am gluten free and they give me lots of options on the menu but this is a favorite. My friends rave about the pad thai . Besides all the gluten free options they also have vegetarian and vegan choices. It is a lively place with a fun atmosphere. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Johnny Mango's is a great stop in Ohio City. One of those places everyone talks about. It's a really cute place. They have a brunch menu on Saturday and Sunday and their regular menu has a nice variety of Mexican/Caribbean inspired food, such as quesadillas, burritos and the like. 

I ordered huevos rancheros from the brunch menu for $7. I also asked for avocado on the side but note - it wasn't worth the $1 extra for the tiny cup. My plate was much bigger than I was expecting for the price! Beans, huevos rancheros topped with salsa and onion and cheese. I would definitely recommend that entree. 

I'd like to come back and try taco Tuesday, but I've heard it gets really crowded. They also have a happy hour from 3-7pm with half priced beers. 

Small patio on the side for outdoor seating. Street parking was plentiful on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Cleveland. The space is small with a communal feel. The bar is definitely the focal point whether it's the fresh squeezed juicing going on or the blood orange margaritas being poured. I'm partial to their pad Thai here as well as some of their small plates. Nachos are a big hit as well as the mushroom quesadilla"}
{"text":"My experience with this restaurant has not been good.  I have been there a few times, mainly because I have attended group meetings there, and the food has been inconsistent in quality, but consistently priced higher than the quality would justify.  Sometimes the food has been lacking in freshness.

The atmosphere is a bit too upscale for my taste, and for the neighborhood--it seems to attract slightly snobby upwardly-mobile professional types.

The service, from my experience, can be quite bad.  When the place is busy the wait-staff seems overworked and unattentive.  On one particularly busy night, I was served a sandwich on a moldy bun, and the waitress was rude and offered no apology.

I can't complain too much though...the variety of the menu is decent and the food tends to be reasonably healthy, with a number of lighter and more balanced options available."}
{"text":"Why can't we give half stars?!?! If we could, this place would fall at a 2.5. I didn't feel that it warrants at 2, but is just below a three... Luckily the rounding up factor worked in their favor.

I went to JM's on Saturday night for a friend's birthday dinner. The building and ambiance are a great for drinks with friends. The food leaves some to be desired. It blew my mind how one side of the menu was \"Mexican\" and the other was of a variety of Asian cuisine with zero fushion of the two. This restaurant literally sits on top of the Iron Curtain between east and west popular dishes.

 As with most restaurants in this part of the country, I'd stick with the Asian side of the menu. The \"Mexican\" side lacks flavor and authenticity (I suppose the Asian side might as well, but I am far more experienced with quality and authentic Mexican cuisine). I had the pad thai and I would recommend it for anyone dining at JMs. Don't bother with the fried tofu. It sounds good, but is just big hunks of tufu fried. It would be much enjoyable if the tofu was cut into smaller portions before being fried.

Overall, come here for some drinks with friends and have a bite to eat if you are or get hungry. Don't bring a huge group as the restaurant just really isn't set-up for it."}
{"text":"Pad Thai, veggie stir fry and margaritas are the best in town!!"}
{"text":"Five stars because I've been here at least 25 times since moving to Ohio City, prolly more like 50 now that I think of it and I've never had a bad experience. 

Even though it's cramped inside it seems like a table always pops open at the last minute for you. 

Once you get settled it feels like a vacation spot and the staff is always in a great mood. 

The food is authentic and fresh, everything is good, clean and prepared right. The portions are very, very generous. 

I recommend the tuna and tofu surf and turf for a light and refreshing dish that is both healthy and delicious as well as vegetarian. 

It's Taco Tuesday every Tuesday and the $1 tacos are worth showing up weekly. Drink selection is amazing and the vibe is so great you're guaranteed to have that one extra drink when enjoying your night at Johnny Mango's."}
{"text":"Take a seat and hear my little (like, elf-little), short story of winning: 

I got a $20 gift certificate from Johnny Mango for using my rewards card.

We went for Taco Tuesday tonight, got 11 tacos, 9 beers and a tab of $29. We spent $9 with a $10 tip. 

Booyah! Love me some JMango!"}
{"text":"I always go here for the half gallon of fresh squeezed oj & usually a guac & salsa too. It's my go to healthy meal!!! It fills me up & gives me lots of energy! Great staff, quality food, prices, & service! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Johnny Mango's for the drinks, but the food is really good!  

I've had their Taco Tuesdays before, and the beef tacos were great.  I'd highly recommend this place for Taco Tuesday.

I just had their Fried Rice (chicken) and it was so good!  Don't be afraid to order it because it is \"just\" fried rice (as I was); it is well worth getting.  (In full disclosure, I tried a friends Fried Rice and coveted hers ever since.)

All the margeritas are amazing.  You should be warned that you do park on the street and you do seat yourself.  Go!"}
{"text":"I love the Johnny!  When I lived in the OC I could walk there, and did most weekends.  Breakfast burrito...all the way."}
{"text":"Margaritas and tacos are the best way to go. I have ventured here twice now and I am pretty much happy. Tuesday is $1 tacos, and who doesn't love Taco Tuesday!

The service was the only thing that is preventing another star. Nice people, but did not seem to be very attentive. Mixing up orders and forgetting about that extra drink. 

But overall, I really like this place."}
{"text":"Best caipirinhas outside Rio! Love the coffee, love the busboy special, love the happy beans.

It's my favorite restaurant to take out of town guests. Each month features a different theme for specials. Great neighborhood restaurant and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I want to like this place - the colors are bright, the decor lively.  But I can't get excited about it.

GOOD:
* Cute, outdoor seating in the warm weather

BAD:
* Food is highly variable in quality.
* I've always felt the place to be slightly snobbish or yuppyish or something; I can't put my finger on what makes the manner of the clientele and the waitstaff offputting.   
* I did have a particularly negative service experience here a long time ago where I made a reservation for 12 people and was made to wait over an hour past the appointed time to sit.  We stayed bc there were a few people joining us later who would have been confused by a location change.  The host was a complete ass and not too apologetic or proactive about remedying the situation (by marshalling smaller tables together, etc).

Petit Triangle just half a block down has much more charm and better food, in my opinion."}
{"text":"ok, it was a late lunch and we didn't drink. and - we ordered the 2 salads, chicken and steak. they were ok. nothing special in any way. oh, and guac with vegetables instead of chips. but it just felt like no one in the kitchen really cared about the food that was being prepared. and it took a long time and the place was pretty empty. i hear dinner is way better - but still, can you just take care with your knife skills? cutting up vegetables like you're 9 years old? not acceptable in my book... we had a really nice waiter. not much else i can say..."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The food is really good and flavorful; they have an interesting and relatively large menu, and the people who work here are nice.  It can get really loud at times, but I've never been dissatisfied with the food or the service."}
{"text":"I love Johnny Mangos! Every new dish I try I enjoy. I've been there a few times and I haven't been disappointed. had the chicken fried rice, chicken quessadilla, grilled chicken salad... all on different occasions I might add lol."}
{"text":"I was disappointed along with a member of my party. Both of our meals were quite bland. The service was fine but I can't go back due to the taste."}
{"text":"Did you ever wonder what restaurant you'd miss the most if you had to move to a different city?  This one is mine.  I've been coming here for years since I moved back from Chicago.  I fell in love with the Napoleon margarita martini and the chicken fried rice (with extra lime sauce).  Once you've had a margarita here, you'll never be able to stomach one anywhere else.  Fresh juices rule supreme here and you can definitely taste the difference.

The service has always been relaxed and friendly.  The food has always been consistent too.  Some people may complain that the menu is too small.  I disagree, everything that comes out of their kitchen is delicious.  I've never had a bad meal here.  Oh and if you have friends who need gluten-free food, they'll have plenty of options.

If you find yourself coming back again and again, you'll want to join their reward program.  I've lost count how much money I've gotten back from this place."}
{"text":"Sorry Mango but my last dinner experience was copmpletely dissapointing. 1.5 stars

Wow, I must have hit this place on an off night. I have been here for taco tues and it was mighty fine.  I came here the another night with a new lady friend and every thing was meh or terrible.

The sangria was pretty bad, but maybe that's because I worked at Mallorca many moons ago.This was like Hawaiian punch with a splash of wine. Tasted like sweet soap,

Next the nachos were the epitome of meh.  Not really hot flavorless beans and diced tomatoes, very little cheese.  I asked the server if they had any salsa and he looked at me like I was crazy and he said they do not have any.  So I got some chipotle sauce on the side.

Next the pad thai.  The absolute worst pad thai.  It was flavorless  except for having too much lime juice and crushed peanuts.  The shrimp  were cold and tasted like precooked cocktail shrimp.  I did not eat more than one bite and did not put it in the to-go box. The server did not ask how it was.  If I was not with a 1st date I would have asked to have it taken off my bill.

Next the jerk chicken. The server advised it would take 30 minutes to cook.  I asked for it spicy.  It came out in 10 minutes and was not spicy. It did not have that jerk flavoring, no cloves, not even all spice.  It was not terrible hence I am not giving this establishment 1 star. The portion was quite big, enough for two people.

Desert was just average.

The service was nothing to talk about. I felt as if the waiter thought he was doing us the favor.

Everything was absolutely under underwhelming."}
{"text":"It's hailing, it's flooding, or even worse, THUNDER-SNOW-ing. And what am I doing?! I am LITERALLY taking my life in my hands to get to Johnny Mango's. This inconspicuous brick house in Ohio City has a brightly colored interior, small familial staff and a comforting menu that boasts a variety of fresh ethnic eats. The bar offers the usual beer, wine, and mixed drinks  as well as delicious freshly squeezed juices. The eclectic menu has something for everyone; even the vegans and gluten frees (and it is clearly marked on the menu! No guesswork!). Most of the portions are big, making it a great value. Note: This place is not wheelchair friendly! In fact, I took Grandma here, forgetting that the bathrooms were down a flight of stairs. Thank God she didn't have to go!! Also, don't forget to join the mango club, too! Every so much that you spend, you get a $25 gift card. It might be $200 or so. Sounds like a lot, but if you are hooked like I am, you will be surprised and rewarded sooner than you think!"}
{"text":"This place had some good drinks.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  We only got chips and salsa with our drinks.  Hopefully, it is not an accurate reflection on the food.  What people ordered around us seemed to look pretty good but didn't look like authentic Mexican food for sure.  

Mojito Madness very nice.

{"text":"Sad to say that regardless of my personal opinion of the food lacking flavor, as well as just about every person who gave JM 3 stars or less seems to agree, I had the WORST service I've had anywhere in years. I was there for Sunday brunch with three others, and after waiting about 40 minutes (with a half full dining room) our food was cold and... wait for it.... Lacking any flavor at all (at this point we are at fault for not just sticking to the Margs) When asking our server, (blonde, glasses, fake smile) how much longer for the food, then letting her know it was cold once it came, she was clearly put out and walked away. After bringing the bill she said she took a round of drinks off, which I thanked her but said it as clear that she was offended at our complaints. She rolled her eyes, walked away, came back and slammed our changed on the table. We then discussed our disgust for her behavior, at which time she came back to the table and said \"I'm trying to walk away but all I can hear is you talking\". We asked for a manger 3 times before going to the bar and asking for one ourselves. We told the \"manager\" what happened, and her reply was apologetic in an EXTREMELY sarcastic, baby talk, high pitched voice, proving that this is why an employee would feel its OK to treat customers the way she did. I've served and bartended for several years and couldn't fathom acting the way either of them did. 

I cannot imagine that the owner would appreciate his employees actions, although Yelp reviewers have proven over and over the flavorless food, yet still... No salt or spices. 

I suggest you go to Momocho.. Blows JMs away!!!"}
{"text":"Tequila sunrise pitchers!  Gotta love it.  Our group of four wandered over to Johnny Mango after eating at the Black Pig.  We were looking for a place to watch the Indians in game four of the world series, and this was a wonderful spot.  We were seated at a comfortable corner table and our server kept the drinks flowing at just the right pace.  Which is to say, it's a good thing we could walk back to our hotel, but we didn't stumble.

We didn't eat at Johnny Mango, but the menu looked interesting, and several tables around us were enjoying their meals with gusto.

Next time I'm in the Ohio City area of Cleveland, I am going to stop here to eat."}
{"text":"Jamaican jerk and bangcock BBQ chicken are great. Get them take out and they come in a cool little pack. Delicious! This place does a terrific job with the food + margs. Awesome patio as well.

Let me reiterate, though.... this place is amazing for takeout because of the takeout containers. They are awesome."}
{"text":"It feels a little weird to be giving this a 3-star review because I really do like it here.  I don't know how long they've been open, but it feels like my friends and I have been coming here for years.  The thing is that we never intend to come here when we leave the house.  We always wind up here as a last minute decision or as a backup when we can't get in somewhere else.  

Does that mean it's bad?  No, not at all.  The Diablo margarita is delicious, and the food and service have always been fantastic.  I just wouldn't recommend it as a special trip.  If you're in the area and are looking for a good place to go?  Sure, you can't go wrong here.  But if you're looking for a unique, special dining experience, you might want to look elsewhere.  This place is like a comfortable pair of jeans...maybe not the most impressive, but they feel great on.  If you do find yourself here, the quesadillas, nachos, and pad thai are all delicious.  The jerk chicken is also tasty if you're here in the evening.  

100% worth checking out if you're just in the mood for a tasty, relaxed dinner.  Not the place to go if you want flashy and trendy."}
{"text":"Cool spot in the Historic District. They have something for everyone. I had the Vegan Nachos made with their house nacho sauce... very good! I tried their lemon basil margarita and it was abut on the lemony side... had a stevia aftertaste but still doable.  After leaving the restaurant I started feeling the effects of just one so I can't complain :)
The entrees are ginormous so if you order extras like my husband, chances are you won't be able to finish it. We had the calypso fries (fried sweet plantains) and they were pretty good. If in town again I'd stop in for a drink and food!"}
{"text":"I don't believe in fate but when we got out of the car and the restaurant we wanted to go to was still closed, we tried Johnny Mango and we got something special.

The best parts of the place were definitely the vibes: friendliness, bright colors, attentive staff (gave me parking tips when I asked about moving my car!). I liked their fun menu and the variety of options.

Hands down the drinks were the best. My boyfriend got this coconut pineapple smoothie which was yummy all over the place, and I got this mango lime fizzy number which was quite delightful. 

We both ordered burritos and we both left still hungry. Truth be told, the chips and salsa that came with it were mighty tasty. The portion size of the burrito was more like a medium soft taco. I ordered the steak, which was well seasoned. My boyfriend ordered the chorizo potato and he says the chorizo was very much lacking.

I'm not from this area but I'd suggest this place to someone else for sure, but maybe have them order more than they think!

Also my waiter kept mixing up my credit card with another lady's. She almost ended up walking out with my card! I was hoping he would discount us for the delay, but he didn't."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite spot in Ohio City! I love the steak fried rice. And I'm a huge fan of $1 tacos on Taco Tuesday and the margarita specials :)

Outdoor seating in the summer is the best! The fellow customers are also very nice :) great place"}
{"text":"Pretty good vegan selections, very wide range of food options. The mango margaritas were pretty fantastic. The food was okay... the sides were kind of odd though in that they really didn't \"go with\" every meal they had the option of accompanying, but you had no choice. A fun place, good service, will definitely return for drinks but not go out of my way for the food."}
{"text":"I just want to be clear up front, this review is only in regards to a brunch visit. 
I was less than pleased with their service. We sat down before the couple next to us, yet they had their meals before I even had my drink. And the waiter had to ask me twice what I ordered. 1-star for service. 
The meal itself wasn't bad. It was fresh and something I normally wouldn't order (mostly because there was NO BACON on the menu). I got the huevos rancheros and I enjoyed it. Would I recommend this place to a friend looking for a good brunch spot? Maybe to my vegetarian friends, but definitely not to someone looking for a hearty, breakfast-y meal."}
{"text":"Great menu, especially the drink menu! The margaritas were delicious and very fresh- not too sweet. They also have $2 taco tuesdays and a juice bar."}
{"text":"Loved it! The nachos were phenomenal and the vegan pad Thai was the best I've ever had! Generous portions and friendly staff make this place a hit! Already planning my next visit!!!!"}
{"text":"Johnny Mango WHY DO YOU SPITE ME SO?!?!?  --An Open Letter to Johnny Mango:
Dear John(ny Mango):
I want to like you.  I really do.  I've tried you at least 15 times, hoping that the gilmmer of hope you give me everytime I sit on your cute little patio sipping your delicious Mojitos would turn into something beautiful.  You're leading me on.  That glimmer of hope is gone faster than the pitcher of sangria that I love so dearly.  Our romance is futile.  You wine me with the sweet promise of your wonderful patio drinks and yet, when it comes to being there for me, for the really big payoff I'm always left wanting so much more from you - you just don't dine me.  Your food is just boring, inconsistantly prepared, and honestly, it just isn't that good.  Maybe its good for you -- but somehow I think you know the truth.  The more you disappoint me with your food the more Margaritas I drink.  The more amazing Margaritas I drink the more I yearn for your food.  The more I yearn the more you disappoint me.  Its a horrid cycle in which we live Johnny, and I can't do it anymore.  I'm done with you.  There are other amazing drinks in this city, there are other cute patios upon which a girl can dine.  I don't need you.  I'm better than you.  And so this is my attempt to end it...

But worst of all, I know my vegetarian friends, the ones that fawn all over you, the ones that think you're so cute and such a nice guy will just drag me right back in you.....

Sigh, we always end up together like this Johnny.  Right back where we started; another pitcher of mojitos, please.

Yours,
Laura"}
{"text":"I just can't get enough!

The first lunch destination that popped into mind when I made a return trip to Cleveland was my beloved Johnny Mango's.

The freshly squeezed juices, ginormous proportions, 'let's just chill' atmosphere and award winning pad thai (among many others) just won't let me venture anywhere that's less familiar!

You're like a drug I can't kick!... Good thing you're no longer so accessible... I think I'd be doomed (but fat and happy) if you were."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! I always crave this place & I drive 45 mins to go:) there is so many things options I love including the Margaritas!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place so it is very hard for me to give it three stars but I have to say there so many things that disappoint me. The service is not the best. The servers tend to be all over the place and not that attentive. I don't care for the place either. I feel that is not that clean.
Their drinks are always amazing. I usually go for the frozen margaritas. I am never dissapointed.
Their food is not bad and it's usually fun. Normally I tend to get the guacamole which is my favorite in the world and their nachos. They are amazing and very well portioned. Great food to share if you come with a few friends. The last couple of times I have gone I got the super miso soup which has veggies and noodles. It's a good soup and it's made to order which I can appreciate (even tho it takes a while) but it is so salty. Way too much for my taste. My friend had the Laska soup and he loved it. I didn't try it because I don't like spicy food. We also tried the pad Thai and the shrimp dish with veggies with rice. Pad Thai was good and nothing special but the shrimp dish again was very salty.  
Conclusion: if u order the guacamole, nachos and their drinks then u will have a great experience."}
{"text":"What's the opposite of sucking? Un-suck? Dis-suck? Well, Johnny Mango's definitely does not suck. And I mean that in the most endearing way possible. 

Too many times I've been to establishments that try so hard to be something they're clearly not. Johnny Mango's doesn't strive for fake.  A relaxed, eclectic atmosphere with colorful menu options, Johnny Mango's is a casual dining and drink destination that most certainly does not suck. 

The menu features an interesting fusion of far East cuisine, South of the Boarder favorites as well as some Island inspired dishes and drinks. The portions are plenty enough to satisfy even the most over-indulged fellow corn-fed Midwesterner. 

One of my few complaints is the general acoustics of this space. The tin coffered ceilings create a loud atmosphere, even with only a moderate crowd. This unfortunately would have to be considered if you wanted a place more conducive for conversation."}
{"text":"If I lived on the near west side, I'd probably be over at Johnny Mango's at least once a week just for their banana chocolate smoothie. It's super delicious and a great refresher on its own, as a start to a meal, or as a dessert.

One of the things I love about this place is how flexible the menu actually is. So many things sound good to me (especially among their daily specials), that I like to swap them into my meals--or maybe make my own meal out of a few specials and an appetizer! You can't go wrong with fresh specials, but their staple items are delicious as well. Everything is fresh and anyone from the strictest vegan to a crazy carnivore can find something toothsome. But be warned! Their specials can change at a moment's notice. Last time I was here, I swapped in their daily bread special (cornbread) with my burrito meal, but between the time I had placed my order and they brought it out to me, they had run out of cornbread :( Luckily, the rye bread and tomato pesto spread was also delicious :)"}
{"text":"Great food with a variety of tasty veggie options. The portions are big as well. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great place with an eclectic crowd and good food. The nachos are a treat but if you get the full plate of them, bring friends."}
{"text":"If Johnny Mango ever left I'd probably literally start shaking. It's such a key part of the Ohio City neighborhood for me, that it is easily a fast favorite.

To begin, the food is inexpensive, fast and healthy. It's also one of the only restaurants with a true juice bar that's not loaded up with sugar. I adore the Kale Aid--which is a smooth blend kale, lemon, and celery. I loathe kale, so I'll take it anywhere I can get it so I fool myself into thinking I enjoy it. I could drink their Kale Aid all day every dayyyy.

Their chicken pad thai might be the best in Cleveland. That's a bold statement, but I stand by it. It's a huge portion, super flavorful and you don't feel guilty after you eat it. It's a thoughtful mix of tofu, egg and chicken, and with a little siracha, it has a perfect kick. Its the only food I ever crave... its basically local comfort food. When you can grab some dinner and sit on their small patio with their pad thai, you'll almost always be a happy camper. Also, their take out totally rules. It's always ready ahead of schedule. Johnny Mango has my heart!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the drinks are good.  We come here often for their vegetarian dishes. The vegan nachos are very good, but could have more toppings.  I usually get a quesadilla and add items to it.  Their sides are usually the best things on the menu.  I almost always love the beans.  They have decent margaritas too.  The service can be really good or not so great depending on how busy they are."}
{"text":"F THIS PLACE!!  Just left out of here.  Ordered a pitcher of margaritas and tacos.   Tasted ZERO booze in the margarita so we ordered two shots of tequila on the side.  So sad we have to do this!   The Amy Winehouse wana-be came over and took our order and never asked if everything was OK and why we would be ordering extra shots of booze when we had full margaritas in front of us.  She was not our regular server...he dissapeared...happens often here.   Ordered 6 tacos. Shells stale as a carboard aplocator!  Sent em all back!  But the cooks were just eating away in the kitchen...guess they found something paletable while they were working.  Maybe focus on PAYING customers food instead of yourself?   I am SO over coming here and feeling cheated and getting treated like crap!  Server never said sorry nor tried to rectify to situation.  Sat here and watched them all talk about us huddled around the register behind the bar.  If they are going to sit and talk about us don't make it so fucking obvious.  No manager ever came over and no server tried to make it right. Went to Happy Dog instead.. I've worked in Ohio City for 10 years and word gets around fast when people have bad experiences...game on Johnny Mangos.."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, i went for lunch today and i had  the gaucho steak, which had no season or flavor whatsoever served with unseasoned steamed rice and bland refried beans and over-killed broccoli, the only good thing was the sauce that comes with it ,  all this for 17 dollars.  Its wasn't worth it at all I'm never going back.  VERY BLAND FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"One of my very favorite places to go!  They have the most amazing jalapeño and cilantro margaritas, the service is phenomenal , and the food is delicious.  Even though I don't want this place to be crowded, I highly recommend you come here. Oh and the bartender Chelsea is BEYOND amazing.  For real."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with Johnny Mangos food was sub par and the staff failed to clean the floors near the open kitchen dead cockroaches around the baseboards near the bathrooms, needless to say we will not be returning"}
{"text":"How is it even possible that I've never reviewed Johnny Mango? 

This restaurant has been my go-to spot for fresh fruit margaritas, patio action, and great vegan options for years. (even when they had the little known Willoughby location that lasted for like, a minute)

On my recent visit, I had the pineapple margarita - a seasonal special. It was good, but my favorite margarita is the blood orange margarita, available in the wintertime. But you really can't g wrong with any of their drinks. When I'm looking for a non-alcoholic beverage, the freshly squeezed juices hit the spot. As a fan of all things green, I especially like the kale aid. 

This restaurant gets extra points in my book for having clearly labeled vegan and gluten free options on the menu, a friendly staff, and food that is always solid. I've been on a fried rice kick, and the veganized fried rice is really amazing. I'm glad I don't live closer or I'd eat fried rice or vegan nachos every day.

Also notable is the brunch menu. There's something for everyone. 

Definitely worth checking out if you're in Ohio City and want some great drinks or eclectic ethnic food options."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time here. Our waiter, Dave, was very fun and helpful. I had the Pad Thai and my boyfriend had the Jerk Chicken. Both were delicious, fresh and FULL of flavor. It is so nice to find a place that is health conscious, delicious and affordable. We also tried the Mango Lime, jalapeno-cilantro, and cucumber margaritas. All delicious and fresh, no syrupy/sweet processed crap here! I wish we had one in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Lovely margaritas. Lovely service. Lovely quesadillas. Over-priced guacamole. I mean, really? $6+ for a scoop of mashed avocados and tortilla chips? For shame, Johnny! For shame!"}
{"text":"New fave on Ohio City area!!!!
We were here on a Saturday morning, 10-ish, and totally surprised to find a table open because he food is awesome and the prices are fantastic!!!
Bonus:  vegan choices abound that taste better than non-vegan anywhere else in the area!
Two coconut frenzy shakes and two orders of chocolate cup waffles for approx $25.  The waffle plates are huge.... Enough for two.. And they give the option of adding pure map,e syrup for $2.50 each. (We took it and glad we did!  They bring you new, unopened baby bottles of maple)

We had a fantastic waitress.  While we were there, the Cleveland party bicycle pulled up and they were hit with a bar order for 20 right away and she kept things running smoothly.  

This place has a lot of character and a lot of cool.  Love it!"}
{"text":"The BEST Pad Thai around!!! Yes, even better than from any Thai restaurant. I get it with chicken, but there are many vegetarian and vegan options here as well. I cannot speak to them because I enjoy meat. But the menu appears to cater well to those eating habits.

Also, some amazing margaritas."}
{"text":"We got chips and gauc and the 'carribean chips' (fried plantain) and pico. It was fine but the wait was long. I was underwhelmed and was surprised by the generous reviews."}
{"text":"The eclectic menu, daily rearrangement of slather, bread & happy beans, interesting specials, fresh juices, and tasty regular menu keeps us coming back.  Get a burrito with a 'big plate' and have some spicy slaw and a fried banana with it. The decor and crowd are interesting - lack of AC and old, old bathroom in the basement are the only minuses. Love this place, the atmosphere, and the fresh food. Margaritas are not bad here either!"}
{"text":"LOVE the drinks. I usually order a quesadilla or combo plate. But let's talk about the drinks again, margaritas in fun flavors, sangria, and all at 5-6 bucks."}
{"text":"\"It's Johnny Mango. Not Johnny MangoS\" 

OR so I have been so rudely corrected by their staff multiple times. Specifically the skinny pro-wrestler wanna be with untameable, tantalizing beard...

But I digress. 

The atmosphere feels like being swaddled in a peace-loving, hand crocheted pashima scarf. The staff is world class. Which is a good thing considering a \"world bar\". It would be a shame if they offered anything less. 

Awesome vegan food. Nice to know they care. I'm a big fan of grains. They have those. 

Anyway go get some food. Make a decision for yourself. Don't be a sheep. 

Would be five stars if it weren't for that brassy blonde streaked stud in the kitchen."}
{"text":"If you want large portions, great drinks, a young/hip atmosphere, healthy and vegetarian-friendly food, go here! Sometimes it gets crowded at night, so go early or prepare to wait. Great staff and brunch food, too! :)"}
{"text":"Very vegetarian friendly. A wonderfully eclectic menu, including fried plantains, spicy tofu, burritos, and lime grilled bananas. You will be sure to find something wonderful and unique on the menu. Fun drink menu. Friendly service, and fair prices."}
{"text":"Flash forward two years later and I feel very... Mehhhhh... About this place. And looking back, I'm not sure why I was so excited about their tacos.

We ordered some plantains (Caribbean french fries) to start. they were like the mushy kind. They tasted alright but if you are weird about textures steer clear. My entrée was Pad Thai and it really wasn't too bad. Not very spicy sweet like traditional though! Actually I'd rather get this dish from elsewhere. I ended up sharing it with my sister because her entrée was not to par. 

She ordered the Tuna Cancuna. NOT WORTH IT. I don't know if they were out of ingredients and they just didn't feel like telling us, but it was essentially just some seared tuna. We didn't even get the yucatán slaw like the menu says it comes with and then when we asked they gave us cabbage slaw to shut us up pretty sure. Just overall not worth the $18."}
{"text":"It's been a year since I visited Johnny Mango, but judging from the reviews they haven't gone downhill.  This was before I got into Yelp, so I actually ended up here on the advice of a bar bouncer.  That sounds like bit of an inauspicious start, but Johnny didn't disappoint.  I had the Pad Thai which wasn't super authentic, but very very tasty.  Wifey had a burrito which was excellent. Also loved their salsa and margaritas.  Love the quirky atmosphere (we live in a college down, so it actually reminded us of home)."}
{"text":"Loved my time here! The background music was exciting! The food tasted good! Lots of different flavorful spices. And the margarita was alright. We got a pitcher which was a decent price. Was not my favorite, but everyone else in my group loved it!"}
{"text":"Nice little joint in a cute neighborhood. BUT there was something a little off about everything I got. Tasty margarita, but it came in a beer glass. Veggie \"burrito\" didn't have any rice or cheese on it, the guac and sour cream that I added to the burrito came on the side, and the burrito wasn't even wrapped up. it was literally a scoop of veggies on a tortilla, that someone folded in half, with both ends open. 

My fiance got a big plate, that comes with beans and something else, but whatever it was, he didn't finish either of it, which never happens. womp womp."}
{"text":"This restaurant is perfect for vegans, vegetarians, and non vegetarians.  Happy enthusiastic atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am not one for writing reviews but I felt compelled to do so after my experience last night.

First off, I would like to say the food was good. Not great, but good. That is not what constitutes the two stars. The Waitress that is clearly in the wrong line of work did not earn those stars either. It was the absence of management. 
This place was like a free for all of mice that were playing while the cat (Or actual management) was away. 

It was taco Tuesday. We did get their rather late, but the kitchen was still open and we managed to seat ourselves at an overly sticky table. 

When the waitress finally got to us, we ordered two drinks and two waters.
The drinks (Irish coffees) came cold. and we only got our water after we asked ANOTHER waitress that didn't look so frazzled with her 2 or three tables. 

We then watched two tables get their food after arriving quite some time after we ordered our food. We were afraid she might have forgotten to put our order in as we watched the kitchen closing down. 

Our tacos came and the constantly preoccupied waitress just dropped the food and walked away. We had no silverware, napkins, salt etc.....

When we finally got her attention to ask for silverware, she said \"sure\" and walked back to the server station. We watched in half disgust as she shoveled a plate of nachos in her mouth and proceeded to SUCK not LICK but SUCK on her fingers in our plain view. She turned around and we made eye contact, she looked startled as if to say \"Oh yeah, your silverware\" Then reached up into a plastic bin and brought us two roll-ups covered in the cheese that she missed when cleaning her hands with her mouth. 
To make matters worse, I turned to see if anyone else saw this... THE COOK!
Yes, he saw the whole thing.... from behind the line of the open kitchen where he grazed on a quesadilla wearing his gloves that he served food with, cleaned with, and probably used the restroom with... ugh....

I am saddened by the lack of management that is clearly missing from this establishment. 

Before you go and open up ANOTHER restaurant, be sure your mgmt. is solid at your other establishments. I would hate to see this place go under because the employees don't give a sh*t. 

If I could upload the photos I had enough time to take of the waitress keeping us from eating, I would."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times and I always find it to be a good experience. In the morning, it has been family-friendly, which is a must when frequenting with two small children. In the evening it has been a relaxing, affordable spot to come get drinks and appetizers with some friends.

Most recently I came here to grab a drink and appetizer at the bar. We ordered the smaller plate of nachos for $5. The portion was still big enough for three people to share and we enjoyed them. What brings this review to a five star review is the mojitos. The mojito here was the best I ever had. Seriously, SO DELICIOUS. Upon leaving, I also realized they sell their mojitos by the pitcher, which is super cool. 

All in all this place is fun and worth coming to even if you are just planning on grabbing a drink."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, food, drinks and atmosphere.  Top notch all around.  Definitely a go to place for a kick *ss experience.  Guacamole and chips, chicken fried rice and fruit/veggie drinks with vodka are all highly recommended!"}
{"text":"$1 taco Tuesdays, awesome! Had avoided this place because the phrase \"World Cafe\" sort of bothers me, but when looking for an affordable dinner spot, decided to stop in. Luckily it was a Tues, and we had some tasty and cheap beef and bean tacos, and some margaritas, and it was a great relaxed night. Also, nice bartender."}
{"text":"The fact that Johnny Mango has remained wildly popular without changing a thing on their menu in years means they must be doing something right. 

One of my favorite things about Johnny Mango is that they cater to vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. I took my parents here while they were visiting because my step-mom, much to my carnivorous father's strong appeal, recently decided to try out the whole vegetarian thing. Normally my dad would stomp his feet at the idea of eating somewhere billed as having \"good vegetarian options\" but to his surprise, he thoroughly enjoyed it (he ordered the flank steak, of course). In fact, the last time they visited my dad even suggested going back!

Now for food suggestions: The Pad Thai is really yummy but everyone else at your table will order it so do yourself a favor and try the fried rice (this may be the most blank-looking-yet-full-flavor meal I've ever encountered). You also can't go wrong with a quesadilla alongside a fresh fruit margarita  but go ahead and order a pitcher, you're going to want another, and then another. ;-)"}
{"text":"I can only speak to my experience but it was good. Never even knew about this place until i was driving in the area last summer (2013) on a weekday thinking of getting a bite and my brother reccomended it. We just walked in and seated ourselves and were greeted and given our menus. Server seemed a bit spacy/bubbly had to come back and ask us things again, i think they should just have her carry around a notepad. Food was great for all of us and we ordered  a few different margaritas as they were on special and they were pretty good as well. I've been to alot of mexican places but none of them tasted as good as this. Great place for a late lunch when they're not busy we were leaving just as the dinner rush was filling the place up. Id reccomend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Fun, delicious, unique. Sensory overload! The velvet chicken is my favorite. Monthly specials are inventive. Cool, vibrant, happy, liberal crowd. This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. One thing they need to fix: the downstairs bathrooms are horrendous."}
{"text":"Drinks were decent. Cheese quesedilla platter, shared with two others, was unimpressive.  Flavorless.  Service was spotty, although the place was not busy. Even the salsa was boring.  This was my first time here (June, 2012) and will likely be my last."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh!

I can't tell you how nice it is to go to a place that serves real food, and serves it well.  The place was crowded, so my group was seated outside, where we froze our butts off in pre-storm gusts.  I didn't mind 'cause the food was so delish!

First we got a large plate of nachos, which looked and tasted fabulously fresh.  They are definitely worth getting, and will comfortably serve four.  We also got the \"fries\", which you'll be down with if you already like fried plantains/bananas.  They're served with salsa, which is weird, but somehow works.  Margaritas were another great choice that night; they were sweet without being syrupy (if they're made with fresh fruit, that'd explain it), and also dangerously strong for the ease with which you can drink them!  You've gotta pace yourself so you don't kill your taste buds before your main course arrives...

My main course was a shrimp salad burrito.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it was definitely just a shrimp salad (main ingredients: shrimp, lettuce, onion, cucumber), and I was a little disappointed because I had been hoping for something more savory.  Still, it was pleasant, although not psychologically satisfying.  I hope to go back and try something heavier.  My boyfriend's quesadilla tasted very good, for example, although the meat was a little fatty.

Overall, the visit was very satisfying, and I look forward to going back.  If Johnny Mango's quality is variable, I definitely hit it on a good night!"}
{"text":"The highly overrated Johnny Mango is only considered good dining by those who have never experienced a good restaurant (which is apparently many many 20- and 30-something city dwellers in this town). Johnny Mango sells itself as a cool, young professional-oriented  hang out specializing in a tame and uninspired interpretation of Caribbean and Latin food. I admit I once enjoyed a Jerk Chicken sandwich here that was tasty and super spicy, but on a later visit the rice and beans that accompanied my entree must have been cooked by someone who never actually ate rice and beans. Here's a tip: Latin rice and beans should not be dry. They should be served in a sauce and be moist and delicious, preferably with a little spice. Johnny Mango's version is dry and tasteless. So many cute and cutesy young professionals can get on your nerves after a while so unless you just want to sip a margarita and pose for the clientele, I say skip this place and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"A very interesting menu! Im a fan of savory foods and this place hit the spot! I got the laska soup and tried my friend's fried rice with beef. The laska soup was a spicy coconut broth with rice noodles and shrimp. I was afraid it was going to be a little sweet but it wasn't, to my relief. And the fried rice was reallyy good! It came with a fish sauce lime sauce. The only negative thing is it takes a little while to get your food, but I really like this place!"}
{"text":"I used to have a real problem with most of what I ate at JM (found it too bland, simple) - UNTIL I tried the chicken fried rice. The best stuff ever. I get cravings for it three times a week. Margaritas, juices, and smoothies are also very good. In general, the service here is great, although the wait for food can take a while when the place is busy (and sometimes when it's not). I love JM."}
{"text":"This is one of the only restaurants in its price range, that properly season their food. 

My fiance and I visit regularly and have always have great service from Marcus. He's one of the few servers who make you feel welcome versus feeling like a customer. 

The fried rice is always amazing (I'm Asian, so I'm an authority on the matter). The quesadillas are always flavorful, and those smoothies...good god. The smoothies do take awhile, and I always apologize when I order one..KNOWING they have to juice fresh fruit and have to use a blender..and they have to milk a unicorn or something.

Anyway, ice cream, great. Salads, great. Smoothies, great. Maragritas, super great. Fried rice, GREAT. Wasabi dressing, supes good. Marcus, GREAT!"}
{"text":"Came with my dad! The gucamole was good.  The pad-tai was a bit greasy for me.  But the taco night redeems itself.  I love the fresh squeezed/pressed juices.  They have awesome cocktails too.  I would suggest the guacamole/tacos/margaritas!"}
{"text":"I just stopped at Johnny Mango because I was in the neighborhood mailing my Christmas Cards. I wanted to order something mild since I was just coming off a bout of the flu. The wait staff deliver a very mild burrito with black beans and freshly grilled chicken that was perfectly done. The server, Jim, did a superb job. All of the ingredients were fresh and the items were cooked to order. All items at al a carte including chips and salsa but that's okay because they are fresh and the salsa is home made and deliciously citrusy. I would highly recommend this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"Went here with the family. They easily accommodated the 8 of us. I must admit that I had high hopes for this place coming in. Got a sangria to start (was trying to pretend it was summer despite the snow) and it was pretty good. Ordered the chorizo quesadilla and my girlfriend insisted that i got the \"super sized version\" what a disappointment.  The quesadilla was dry and tasteless. I expected it to be spicy and delicious! And all the same with the \"super sized\" version was extra beans, rice, and a plantain i would have expected more quesadilla. But i will admit I was a little drunk and probably didn't read the menu that well (not that i do when i am sober). No one else was really impressed with their food ether. I think it was just an off night, i would like to try them again. Service was nice but kept calling all the females \"babe\", \"hunny\", etc which annoyed them."}
{"text":"I love me some Johnny Mango.

Back in the days when I worked at Near West Theatre, which is about a block away, I was here constantly.  It's a \"World Cafe & Bar\", featuring eclectic dishes and drinks, including a juice bar (MMMM, Zoni Beach smoothie) and a wide array of tasty alcoholic stuff (their sangria is delicious and ther mojitos are to die for).  They have a giant whiteboard behind the bar that lists their Happy Bean of the day, Grain of the day, monthly featured dish, etc. - always fun to pick from.

Their pad thai is amazing, as is their Jamaican Jerk chicken, and their Bangkok BBQ chicken... ooh, and their \"Big Plate\" burrito/quesadilla meal; you can get all kinds of different meat fillings, but my fave is the savory Mushroom, Tomato and Garlic.  These big plates come with Johnny's tangy slaw, the Happy Bean, the Grain of the Day and a grilled banana... SO good.

Which brings me to another banana-family Mango dish: the Caribbean Fries.  These are plaintains mashed and fried in peanut oil and served as an appetizer, four to a plate.  With some of Mango's fresh salsa, you can't go wrong.

To finish, they always have an interesting ice cream selection (such as pumpkin or pistachio), but I highly recommend the Chocolate Triple X, a chocolate pate that absolutely melts in your mouth.  Sinful.

They also have the Passport Club, a card you can swipe every time you go there to collect points towards free stuff or coupons - and they send you a $10 gift certificate every year for your birthday!  Just got mine last week, and I can't wait to go!"}
{"text":"Cool fresh modern mex neighborhood food. Always a great spot for a cheap, hip dinner or pickup. Many of the ingredients are very fresh & organic making the dishes revolve around the natural flavors. Great food for vegetarians or vegans too. 

My favorites are the steak quesadilla big plate, the fried rice (with chicken or shrimp) & the Lo mein. Be sure to give all of them a try. Typically I'll go very hungry & get the big plate + split the fried rice or Lo   mein with my date. The big plate comes with a side of rice, fresh bean of the day, vinegar slaw, & a grilled banana. All portions are pretty good size. Definitely get the firey life sauce to top the rice with. It's not too hot but adds a tart flavorful kick. 

Taco Tuesday is fun here too. Used to be $1 tacos but recently upped to $2. I'm not vegetarian or vegan but still enjoy the black bean tacos. 

Johnny Mangos' drinks are probably its staple, with freshly made juices, margaritas, mojitos, & sangria. They do a solid brunch too with a twist on some of their Mexican items adding in eggs, chorizo & cornbread. Coffee served in all kinds of cool mugs too. 

My only complaint would be that the service can get lackadaisical on occasion. I've had 2 bad experiences & another time where a waiter wouldn't stop talking about his personal life. The most recent time they forgot my order & said it would be right up, but took another 10-15 minutes once everyone was done and they still charged for it. I can understand a mistake, but once realizing it the mistake should be resolved asap. Not cool if you ask me but unfortunately for me the food is so good that I can look past it."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner before a concert at Nautical Pavilion. I love the options for vegetarians and vegans. We got the guacamole as an appetizer. It was good and a nice portion size for 2. We opted for the $1 more for salsa. It was a good. I got the vegan Pad Thai because since going vege I haven't been able to order it. It was delicious. The hubby got the mushroom, tomato and onion solo burrito. He should have gotten the big plate. It was just a burrito only. The waiter was attentive but the wait was a little longer than normal so just make sure your not in a rush."}
{"text":"Johnny Mango's is a near west-side Cleveland institution, and in the decades I've been going there, it's been consistently hip and delicious. The take out is great, and the dine-in is better, but let's be clear: you need to either make reservations, or get there EARLY! The space has limited seating, and it gets loud, but the food... so worth it.

My go to there is their Pad Tai, but their fusion style menu is loaded with can't-go-wrong options. If you are vegan, or on a gluten conscious diet, or just a health nut, there is something for you. If you love fried plantains, then you MUST try them here. They also have a juice bar that always seems to draw folks from the neighborhood. 

And let's not forget their Jamaican and BBQ flared dishes! (Oooh, and margaritas! They make great margaritas!) Johnny Mango is tradition in Ohio City, and I love it!"}
{"text":"If you swing by my profile, you'll see that Johnny Mango's Vegan Pad Thai would be one of two choices for my last meal. I love it. I mean, I REALLY really love it. It's not your traditional Pad Thai, but it can be rivaled by no other. The only real difference I've noticed between JMs regular and vegan versions is the fish sauce. Both have tofu, and no egg. If you haven't been here before, I highly suggest you try it. Now that we got the most important part out of the way I'll review the rest!

I love the location. Ohio City is one of my favorite Cleveland neighborhoods. It's far enough from 25th street that you can almost always find (free) street parking (no lots near here), but close enough to easily walk to other places in the area. There is outdoor seating during the warmer months, which is perfect for relaxing with a margarita. There are two ways that it can go when you arrive. Either you seat yourself, or someone is there to waitlist you. There is a long bar across one side of the place where you could sit and enjoy a cocktail, and on the other is a long bench. They do a good job of getting as many tables and chairs as possible in between. Service is timely and friendly enough. I've never been really impressed by it, but it's ok, and since the food is amazing, I can't complain. 

Besides the Pad Thai I raved about in the beginning, I also love their vegan nachos. The chips have a good crunch, the ingredients are spread out well across them, and they are always fresh. On the weekends they have a brunch menu in addition to their standard one, and it includes vegan waffles! 

There is a good size drink menu with margarita, cocktails, and deliciously fresh juices. It's one of the few places I don't say \"just water\" when I order my meal. I'm not sure how long they've been here, I'm guessing at least 15-20 years since I was a teenager the first time I went. I'm just hoping they never, ever leave!"}
{"text":"There food and customer service is always superb. My favorite is the chicken fried rice with the lime sauce. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I feel sad that I just raved about this place and now have to take away two stars. Went there last night again for Taco Tuesday since we had such a great time last week. Experience was that bad. I don't really understand how hey are so understaffed or ineffectively staffed perhaps. 

We stood at the door for 3-4 minutes before we were greeted. It was busy so whatever we weren't reallly bothered it was just confusing. It seemed like maybe they were trying to stagger seating or catch up because they were not cleaning tables off. It seemed like there were about 3-4 with checks waiting on servers. There were 2 servers on the floor, two bartenders, a host/busser, and one other person (not sure what their job was). AKA they had more than enough people for this small space. 

Back to me - after about 15 minutes we were seated. No problem. an 8 top sat down right before us and then 2 (3) tops after. Well - we sat. & sat. & sat. No one came up to even acknowledge we were sitting there. We saw one server approach one of the three tops to take their drink and food order. The other server took the 8 tops order then approached the other 3 top. We were confused and thought maybe our table was in the middle in no one's section. But then the table next to us got their check brought to them and cashed out. Still no one came to our table. 

So, we left. Really disappointed and won't be back for a while. As two people in the industry we get it. When you're in the weeds, you're in the weeds. But when you have that many people working and no one can greet a table there's a problem."}
{"text":"Johnny Mango sits at the corner of one of the weirdest three-way intersections on the west side. Brave it and you'll find a decent meal, and decent drinks, but nothing that makes you think, or say, \"wow\". At $5 per glass, I enjoyed the sangria, which had a hint of carbonation to it, but I've had better. For dinner I had the chorizo and potato quesadilla plate. The plates (your choice of burrito or quesadilla with a selection of filling choices plus black beans, cheese, sour cream and salsa) come with beans (pinto variety) presented on a leaf of lettuce, slaw (not flavorful enough for my taste), a friend banana, and on this day, white rice (bland and sticky). It was a filing meal, and I would eat there again, but I didn't leave there anticipating my next visit."}
{"text":"Five stars for the service I had today during lunch at the bar. She was attentive, engaging and informative - especially for someone who was visiting Cleveland for the 1st time. I ordered the shrimp pad Thai, as it came highly recommended.  It did not disappoint - generous portion of noodles and shrimp with tofu and eggs. Great lunch!"}
{"text":"Best margaritas in the city!!!! I could eat the chicken fried rice everyday of my life until the day I die. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"I met my gentleman friend here and we sat at the bar.  It took a while for a bartender to notice me; I was there 15 minutes before I got a drink, a weak sangria.  There were several bartenders tripping over each other, yet drinks AND food orders took forever.  I haven't had such slow, inept service in a while.  The place is extremely loud; it was difficult for said gentleman friend and me to hear each other.

I didn't try my friend's pad thai, but he said it was good.  I got the fried rice with veggies, and I must say, it was really fabulous.  I eat gluten-free, and I do appreciate that the GF choices are marked on the menu.

But the slow, indifferent service...well, that I just can't overlook.  I go out for stress relief, not for an establishment to cause stress.  I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"My expectations were high, and I gave them some leeway, but I just cannot rate this place well......
Noise level is extreme, so plan on yelling over dinner.
Service is unbelievably slow for such a small place.
Food was ok, but really too simple in my mind to warrant a good review.  Quesadilla had steak and cheese partially filling the pita, and a small side cup of chopped veggies, it was just ok.  Wife had the pad thai, which was really sour and left most on the plate.
Overall, very average, but the lousy service puts it over the top in a bad way.  (Also, I thought the Margaritas were 80% ice)"}
{"text":"I got the chorizo potato burrito solo. I wish I would've gotten the big plate, to try more offerings. When I picked up my burrito it fell apart, taco bout SADNESS. The guac needed some more salt or lime juice. I wasn't highly impressed, but I do want to go back and try more because maybe I just ordered the wrong thing? $2 for the extra guac I ordered seemed like a lot."}
{"text":"This has been a favorite choice for family gatherings because my brother does not eat meat. I have tried almost everything on the menu and nothing disappointed. I usually get a side order of the happy beans or whatever they are called. The chicken stir fry is always good as well as the Jamaican Jerk Chicken. The brunch is one of my favorites. The omelets are good especially the chorizo and potato. They have El Yucateco hot sauce already on the tables so I pour it on the eggs and it tastes great. The juice bar is very refreshing. One of their fruit juices sounds good right now especially with the weather heating up. Johnny Mango usually has a pretty lively and festive atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love Johnny Mango!  This is one of my favorite places in Cleveland.  I do not drink margaritas, but the Diablo is darn good, that I cannot help myself!  

The food is amazing.  I love the pad thai, the fried rice, guacamole, fried tofu, quesadillas, and the amazing sides.   I've tried to replicate the chorizo and potato quesadella at home, but it doesn't come close to the tastiness that Johnny Mango can achieve.  I like to order the big plate, which come with Happy Beans and Grain of the Day, then my boyfriend and I fight over the deliciously grilled banana that comes with the meal.

I've gotten many friends hooked on Johnny Mango and I never tire of it.

It's affordable and a fun atmosphere too!  It's a great hangout on week nights or weekend afternoons too.  And how about the brunch.  Oh and the patio!  Fun!"}
{"text":"Always good. Cool hip urban bar. Great food. Pad Thai is the best in Cleveland. Ask for the homemade chipotle sauce. Put that on top, boom, better than sex. Margherita's are some of the best too."}
{"text":"Gotta love the Mango.  

Whenever I'm up in Cleveland on business or just for kicks, I try to stop in.  I love it for summer Friday afternoon Margaritas on the patio and the chorizo and potato quesidillas, yum.  The Burritos are quite good here as well, though it can be a lot of food, especially if you get the big plate with beans, rice, etc.  

The service could be better (hire more servers), and the place bigger (not much to be done there), but all in all a good casual dinner and drinks place."}
{"text":"I have never had a worse dining experience than I had here this past week. My father was in from out of town and knowing that he loves caribbean and seeing positive reviews, I thought this would be the perfect place. I was highly mistaken.

Upon arriving, we were told we had a 15 minute wait, no big deal. The location is small, so that was logical. We waited and waited, much longer than the 15 minutes we were told, but instead were standing in the small entrance for almost an hour. Once we sat down, we were starving. We had looked at the menu during our waiting time and we were ready to order. When our waiter came over, he told us he couldn't take it yet and to wait and he would bring us some waters. He proceeded to take the drink orders of three of the tables around us before bringing us our water and taking our food order.

We asked for the BBQ chicken big plate, but he said that due to to preparation for the dish it would take about 40 minutes to come out. Knowing how hungry we were, we asked what the fastest options were and opted for fried rice and some tacos. We were hoping to get an order of the Caribbean fries, but we were informed they were out. 

Then we waited. And waited. We waited as another table was seated beside us and given their drinks, and food. We waited as the couple that sat down the same time as us had already been served their food and paid their bill. We waited as everyone that was in the line waiting with us was seated and being served their food. 

After near another hour of waiting, my father and I got up and left. I have never walked out of a restaurant before my food came out and without paying in my life. This was one of the worst dining experiences (if you could even call it \"dining\") I had, especially in Cleveland. 

My dad and I proceeded to walk about a block down the street and eat at \"Heck's Cafe\". One of the best meals I have ever had."}
{"text":"Review update. I haven't been here in 2 years, but unfortunately I had a better meal the first time. 

I went for brunch and ordered the Huevos Rancheros. First off I will say the price of $6 - especially for the portion size given - is amazing. The menu description and \"world café\" being in the name of this places makes the dish sound equally amazing. It sounds like it will be bursting full of flavour: \"Two sunny side up eggs, ranchero sauce (muy picante) and cheese atop crispy corn tortillas. Served with beans & cornbread.\" 

The cornbread was good and the eggs cooked well, but overall, bland is the word that comes to mind. The food, unfortunately, is really just \"A-ok.\" Definitely not bad, but just okay. And the massive double+ portion of black beans is a little off setting. 

Our server was friendly and set the mood perfectly for a Sunday Funday Brunch, but the kitchen service was slow. 

Also for what it's worth I noticed as one of the guy servers was cleaning off an empty table he dropped a ketchup bottle on his way back to the kitchen. No problem there, but then he proceeded to kick it along with him like a soccer ball all the way to the back. That's just gross - not okay. 

Free WiFi.

From other reviews taco Tues seems to be the thing to do so maybe I'll try that next."}
{"text":"Best pad thai in Cleveland! Although it varies each time I go, it is always delicious. The menu has many options which is nice for pickier eaters. Johny Mango also has a great brunch menu and happy hour! They don't take reservations, so be ready to wait sometimes."}
{"text":"I was a bit lost getting here, but then again I'm new to Ohio City so it makes sense. I circled around and kept missing it, but finally figured it out. It's right on the corner of the weird intersection of Bridge and W. 29th. There is street parking available and a little cute awning over top. The place itself is adorable and almost NY'ish in a way. 

I met up with a friend and we had some lengthy catching up to do. Our waitress caught the vibe that we were doing a lot of talking and was present when needed but not overly checking up or making us feel rushed. Anything I asked for was delivered in such a timely manner. Very impressed! 

I started with a nice Sangria for $5 which was a great deal and was punched with flavor. It was perfectly balanced with the strength of the wine and the fresh robust juice. It went perfectly with the guac and chips we ordered, which was chunky and delicious, and not too spicy. Great texture and was delivered with a pepper on top, which I think soaked into the guac a little for a bit of extra flavor.

I ordered the chicken burrito which was two mini burritos on one plate... grilled chicken breast with earthy leafy toppings and a fresh pico de gallo. It was simple and not too heavy. It felt light and satisfying rather than weighed down and stuffed. It came with chips as well and I took one of the mini burritos to go! Very content! 

My friend ordered a chicken dish with veggies and rice that looked splendid. A lot more food with that one, so if you're really hungry or want some take out, go for one of their entrees! 

I did not try a smoothie but the deliciousness of the authentic juices I had in my sangria gave proof to what I could expect in that realm. I live less than 1 mile from Johnny Mango and super look forward to checking out some other menu options. Thanks for bringing a fresh and healthy cute little establishment with feel good vibes right down the road!"}
{"text":"I think Stephanie C said it best -- atmosphere and alcohol are pretty much all Johnny Mango has to recommend itself.  I've had the big plate with something meaty and the pad thai and both were borderline inedible.  The food is simultaneously bland, salty, dry, mushy, and pricey with cheap ingredients.  Don't eat here. 

That said, the reason I didn't give it 2 stars is that it has a fun vibe and it's situated on a lovely corner in Ohio City.  On a nice day, it's tough to beat a table outside Johnny Mangos with friends and ordering round after round in one of very cool very cute pockets of a neighborhood.  

Oh -- and they have HAPPY HOUR: M-F 4-7pm 1/2 off beer and wine and $2 off all other drinks."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Johnny Mango's.  I feel healthier just eating here :)
I gravitate to a few favorites here.  I like the busboy special - an inexpensive choice of $7.50 gets you a grain, veggie, and happy beans.  Menu is chef's choice that rotates.  My last order was jasmine rice, kidney beans with red pepper that had a southwestern flavor and a fresh asparagus salad.  Check the board when you come in to see what is being featured. 
One of hubby's favorites is Pad Thai. We both love the Bangkok BBQ Chicken   $15 and Flank Steak, Gaucho Style   $17.  Warning the Bangkok chicken takes about 20-30 minutes to prepare. If you don't want to wait while the others are eating, call ahead and ask them to start your order.   We both love that the chicken and steak meals are served with the grain, happy beans, veggie of today and bread & slather.  I wish they had the cornbread every day for the bread choice, but I think it is only on the weekends.
Thirsty?  They have GREAT margaritas that are made with fresh juices, not the cheap sour mix stuff.  Johnny also has a huge juice bar menu.
The interior decor is bright and colorful.  They also offer some patio seating."}
{"text":"Johnny Mangos is happiness.

Get the Jamaican fries.  Actually.... get at least 1.5 orders per person.

What are they?  Fried plantains (member of the banana family).  They are amazingness.

Other than that, they are very vegan friendly.... er... friendly to vegans.  The staff will help you figure everything out, and is very knowledgeable on the sauces, dressings, and dips that go on their food.  It's nice to know that a restaurant would actually train their staff as to what it is exactly that they are serving people.  Surprisingly, not many do.

They also get their produce and such at the West Side Market.  Thus, supporting other local businesses, which is always a plus!

They only down side I have found is that it's not a largely comfortable atmosphere.  Though, the one time I sat outside, it was great.  Maybe it's the noise, and uncomfortable chairs inside.  Either way, that does not deter my love for Mr.  Mango."}
{"text":"I don't know why Johnny Mango always has such a long wait. The  food is mediocre... in fact - it reminds me of the things I used to make in college with my roommate. Burritos with canned beans, chips... nothing special or overly flavorful. Not worth the wait... and the service is slooooowwwwwwww"}
{"text":"The food here is 
A) really good
B) not greasy at all
C) reasonably priced
D) all of the above

Answer: D! Come here with friends and have a good time! Their drinks are delicious and almost 2/3 of the menu has tequila! A dinner for 4 with drinks cost less than $75. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great place with many healthy food and beverage options.  Two of my friends are big fans of their Pad Thai and that's what they always order.  I like to switch things up and get something different every time.  

The portions are very filling and the service has always been top notch!  The place is always busy, but I've never had a bad experience.  If I lived closer, I'd go there for happy hour!  

Plenty of vegan options here too!"}
{"text":"The food here in consistently good. Drinks are delicious. It's small so it can get crowded fast. If it weren't for the sometimes snooty, hipster wait staff, I'd give this place 5 stars."}
