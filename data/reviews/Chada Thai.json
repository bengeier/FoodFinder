{"text":"There are many thai restaurants in the area, Chada has one of the best pad thai.  The dish is very flavorful.  The noodle they use have a different texture compare to other thai restaurant.  Service was kinda slow as there was only 1 waitress on Tuesday night.  Because of the slow service so I have to take out a star and give it a 3."}
{"text":"Chicken satay was well flavorful and the peanut sauce was tasty. The Pad thai was okay and the mango salad didn't have too much fish sauce which was nice. I will return to try something new."}
{"text":"Having moved to Canada from the UK last year, I've been on the hunt for an amazing Thai restaurant. This one is just that! The food is authentic (I can say that being Thai myself) and served up with that signature Thai smile. The atmosphere is relaxed and elegant, and the patio was really nice. The first time I went with my partner we had Pad Thai and the Sukho Thai fish which were both outstanding. We've been back numerous times with family and friends and each time the food has been incredible. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Outstanding food here.  Best Thai in The Beach by far.  Ingredients always very fresh, presentation great, service is very friendly and prices pretty reasonable.

I highly recommend this place if you want authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"I ordered the seafood salad. Perfectly seasoned. Scallops, calamari, mussels, cilantro, lime, spicy. It hit the spot. I was looking for a healthy, yummy, filling meal at a good price... and that is what I got. My only complaint is that I'm fairly certain the seafood had been previously frozen and thawed before cooking. Not a huge deal (especially for the price), but fresh is ALWAYS noticeably better. Service was excellent, very welcoming and friendly, there when you wanted them to be but not when you didn't want them to b I'm looking forward to trying some of their other dishes :)"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. It is easily the best Thai food I've had in Toronto. (Maybe excluding Khao San Road) Reminds me of my teaching days in Thailand!"}
{"text":"Delicious pad Thai, fresh rolls, mango salad and soup. Friendly service and fast delivery. A welcome addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"This place is truly a gem in the Beaches! There are lots of thai restaurants in this area, but I wouldn't hesitate to say that Chada Thai offers the best thai food in the area. I just came here for dinner and enjoyed a wonderful meal. Looking forward to returning here again and again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! It's great for take out very quick. The flavours for pad Thai and curry is sooooo good. A definite return spot and best Thai in beaches by far. Service was friendly and pricing is standard. Sauce on curry was amazing."}
{"text":"Really great, authentic Thai food. We started with the Tom Kha and Hot Sour soups, then had the peanut curry beef, basil eggplant, and spicy Thai noodle. Really enjoyable atmosphere and tasty dishes - especially the basil eggplant.  Service is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"I have visited this place a few times and to say that the curries and noodles are quite authentic. Having visited many Thai restaurants in the GTA, this restaurant prepares dishes that have a similar taste and texture to the food I tasted in Thailand. The restaurant is also endorsed by the Department of International Trade (Thailand). 

The reason why I took out some points is that it did not seem that they had enough servers. It took them a while to even bring us the menu. This would not be a place to visit if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"I've already reviewed this place, but it seems to have gone missing!?!? I'll say it again: EAT HERE!! this will be the 3rd time ive eaten here in as many weeks! Its delicious, and hasn't dissapointed yet! The curries are sooooo good I could just drink them! the Pad Thai is a little on the sweet side, which is fine by me."}
{"text":"This place is horrible stay away, so much MSG (or whatever chemical flavor enhancer they use) we could taste the chemicals in the food and didn't feel well for about 24 hours afterwards. I ordered a papaya salad and it had no ground peanuts, no chili flakes...was awful don't waste your money."}
{"text":"We came during lunch and tried their lunch specials. Food was decent and i would have given it a 3.5, but service was excellent and the patio was great, so I'm upping it to a 4."}
