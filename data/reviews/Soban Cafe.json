{"text":"This is the worst place I have ever been to in my life. Service is terrible,  waited forever to place the order.  The coffee legit taste like water. The taro milk tea is disgustingly sweet and yes it tastes like medicine. The kimchi fried rice is cold and gross.  I will not come back again and 100% will not recommend anyone to come here.  Worst experience ever!"}
{"text":"It's alright, nice clean and quiet place for studying, pretty solid WiFi too. My friend and I met up here for a study night, and when I arrived around 6:45 pm (Wednesday) the place was nearly empty, but eventually the place was filled up within 30 mins. Unfortunately I did not get the opportunity to try any food items i wanted (dumplings and kim-chi friend rice) because it wasn't available. However I did enjoy my Ginger Twist hot tea that I ordered. For the nice ambiance and decor, it's worth a second visit, just not on an empty stomach.  **there are some paid parking spots nearby, or you can find those side parking on residential streets**  **the entrance is on Finch Ave W shared with a travel agency and a karaoke bar, make sure you take the stairs to the second floor**"}
{"text":"Such an amazing place to be ! Warm , great service. Feel in a great harmony. A lot of different foods and dessert, so hard to make a choice! !"}
{"text":"Seems like this place has a variety of fancier lattes, etc. but I was only feeling like an Earl Grey tea. First of all, it was priced at $6-7, which is ridiculous, but I hoped for good quality tea leaves. It came out in a cup with a Shoppers Drug Mart brand name tea bag. Completely blows my mind."}
{"text":"I loved this little hidden cafe at finch and yonge before they renovated. Their red bean latte was my favourite but the last time I ordered it, it did not taste good. Their beverages and drinks are average. It is a nice quiet place to study."}
{"text":"I've never been to this cafe. But it seems okay:) I think my friends are gonna go today. So say hi to them!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were craving late night dessert so we decided to stop by here. It was packed and we were seated quickly, so that was pretty good. We ordered the Sago grass jelly and ice cream, and a purple rice dessert and waited almost an hour for it. A table next to us, who had somebody come in 10 minutes after us and ordered two dishes got it 20 minutes before we even got our cold desserts!   Would not come back again/10."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. When my bf was about to pay the bill, the waitress just tapped his credit card and did not give a receipt. I asked her for the receipt and she told us they don't have customer receipt. So I asked to take a look at the merchant receipt and she tipped herself 20% Without us even knowing !!! I would've been okay with 20% if the service was good but it wasn't. We had to wait 20 mins after being seated to get our order taken & had to ask for water multiple times before she brought it to us. 0/5 would NEVER recommend to anyone or come back to this cafe."}
{"text":"@ Yuyuan T. of Soban Cafe (who replied to my initial review),  I assure you, when I went to study it was NOT 6 degrees. It was a nice sunny day in the summer time. There is NO WAY it was 6 degrees. I personally dislike going out when it is cold. I would rather \"hibernate\" and stay inside in the warmth of my house rather than studying outside in the freezing cold. Your ridiculous comment and LIE is making me update my review to a 1 star.   Also, I am quite good at studying with noise. I've studied at Starbucks, Second Cup, Green Grotto, McDonalds (and McDonalds gets pretty loud), etc. I've never had a problem at those places unless I'm listening to a lecture recording, which is then my fault. However, when I was at Soban I was only reading the textbook, I did not have to listen to any lecture recordings. So do NOT sass me. On yelp your noise level is listed as casual, I would DISAGREE, but perhaps it depends on the time that you go. Again, I said that the noise level died down in the evening."}
{"text":"Soban has a great modern feel to it with it's exposed brick walls contrasted by slick clean furniture and tables. It was more like sitting in someone's industrial loft style condo than a restaurant but bigger.   They have an impressive menu with plenty to offer but we were there late so all we had was desert and tea.   We flipped through their collection of Korean and some Japanese magazines and people watched. The atmosphere just seemed to invite sitting around and staying a while.   It's been a while but I would love to go back and see if it's changed at all. The last time I was there was great."}
{"text":"It's actually really good here!! I'm surprised cause many places don't wow me when it comes to how the food taste. The place is nice inside n food is amazing! I shared a Fruit Waffle with my friend & it was just theorist amount if food for us, nice for sharing!"}
{"text":"Great lighting and hit Korean pop songs as music background.  We tried waffle and toast. They were both hot and fresh. There was great view by the windows where the Yonge Street could be seen. Good place for reading books as well. I wish I had books in front of me or exams to study for. However, for real BBT or waffle, I would still go to Chinese(Taiwanese) Tea Shop."}
{"text":"We ordered lunch and dessert through UberEATS for 3 people. Wait time for delivery was 30-45 minutes. The desserts came in low, round plastic dishes with a clear lid. These were very shallow and wide which made eating our dessert soups very difficult. The plastic spoons provided were small teaspoons that made the dessert soups doubly difficult to eat. Our orders were Black sticky rice with coconut \"juice\" or milk and QQ balls, Taro with sago, and black sticky rice with mango chunks. The consistency of the soup for all three desserts was extremely watery and tasted like a powder-water-white sugar mix. The mango chunks in the black sticky rice was sour and texture wise was papery. The QQ balls were essentially sticky flour balls; this would've been fine if they were cooked thoroughly but they were not! Hence when you bit into these balls, you got a gooey outer part with a powdery inside. The taro soup, despite being a neon, industrial purple, was flavourless. Everything was thoroughly disappointing and would definitely not return."}
{"text":"+Great desserts  +Great atmosphere  ++Friendly staff  ----Unreliable wifi (Half the time the WiFi doesn't work) You would have so many more customers with a reliable wifi. Please fix"}
{"text":"Terrible. Its like a porridge; soggy and tasteless.  It looks like it was taken out of garbage."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was quite nice but they were extremely understaffed. We waited about 20 minutes for a menu. After 20 more minutes a girl came to take our order but we found out they did not serve food or redbean lattes at that time. We asked for 2 more minutes to decide. 20 minutes later we waved her over. 20 minutes later we got our food. The food was good but definitely over priced. 8 dollars for a block of toast with whipped cream? I'd rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The staff were very kind and the drinks (my friend got the white chocolate mocha and I got the caramel macchiato) were great! Both drinks were $4.99 for a decently sized mug. The cafe itself has a really relaxing and comforting feel to it with its simple set up and soft Korean music in the background. I definitely recommend grabbing a window seat if you enjoy people watching!   It was a little difficult to find the entrance to the cafe (you have to go up a stairway that faces finch!) but overall it was a good experience and I'd definitely return another day!"}
{"text":"This cafe has a nice view of Finch Station, and the decor was great too. I was with my friends for a tea, and they served Halloween cookies for free! I ordered honeydew milk tea, but it tasted powdery - I probably won't try this again. However the great service and atmosphere earned an extra star. I wouldn't mind coming back with my friends again."}
{"text":"While the cafe itself has a good location and a nice view of Yonge street, I was disappointed by everything else.  I ordered a coconut slushy bubble tea which tasted like water. The service was horrible. No one came to take my order until I walked up to the counter myself.  Overall, I was very disappointed with this place and I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Um, it's a strange place for me. Maybe it has a certain appeal to young Koreans, but I'm neither young, nor Korean.   I got an Americano which was really weak. It tasted bland. I told them, and they gave me a double shot. Overall, I make better coffee at home. $4 is just ridiculous.   For service they certainly get 4 stars,  though. They were polite enough and attending.   Environment was 4 stars for location, and 2 on the overall interior. It's just a small room with nothing special.   As I mentioned, my Americano wasn't good. I might go back and try something else but that's not likely. Their prices are way too high for what you really get.  My score is closer to 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Went here for dessert after dinner on a Sunday, around 7pm. Was able to get a seat right away.   We ordered the mango sticky rice thing (sorry forgot the name lol) and the mango crushed ice. The sticky rice came first. We were hoping they would come out at the same time.. but the crushed ice came after we were done with the other one. The crushed ice was $7.99, decent size for the price, but the taste was just ok. Nothing special.   The place was very loud, not sure how some people were studying or doing work there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Cafe, they serve food, drink dessert. Whenever you want have dinner, after dinner dessert or drink you can come to here."}
{"text":"Cute cafe above some sketchy karaoke place. They serve a small variety of dishes as well as dessert and a larger range of drinks. It's a cute, quiet cafe to do some work/studying. I like that you can see Yonge street from the cafe so you can people watch when you don't feel like working anymore.  We got here around 8pm and was seated right away. I ordered a London Fog and he got the Red Bean Latte. Both drinks came out soon after but was lukewarm.. the flavours were good but no one likes a lukewarm latte.  I would come back because I like the atmosphere/environment of the place but might try their cold drinks next time."}
{"text":"The place is not big but it was enough for this cafe. It's situated upstairs in this building which is nice because you can look down and see the busy street and people outside. The prices were reasonable for the drinks. The specialty coffees ranged from $4 to just over $4. More or less like Starbuck prices.  I didn't check out the food but I was really only there for a coffee. Good place to chit chat with friends. The wait staff were generally friendly. The clientele is mostly Korean. The cafe is clean which is something I always look for.  However I didn't find the seats and tables very comfortable to sit at.  I think the legs of the table got in the way of our legs in an already small place. Other than that I would come back again."}
{"text":"It was mediocre before, now the food and service got even worst after the change in management."}
{"text":"Nice spot for a nice cup of coffee and dessert. We originally wanted to try the crepe from here however, they sold out.  We then ordered the fruit waffle. Overall it's not too bad, average service."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5! Came here since they had a free soban toast promotion on facebook with a drink purchase. The Soban toast I believe was a new dish they wanted to test out that consisted of toast with honey (?), cream cheese, red bean and whipped cream. It sounds really weird but it was actually REALLY, REALLY good. I was shocked myself to be honest! I was slightly disappointed with the drinks though. I got banana milk tea and the bf got ocean breeze (or something like that; which I eventually stole from him). They were tasty but at the same time they were toooooo sweet for my personal taste. Overall there are better drink places around but I do like how they try new things with food! Will probably go back to try other things from their menu to see if I can find something else that's new and delicious.  I also really appreciated the fact that the owner came out just to ask me if the Soban toast is ok. It shows me that he really cares about his products and the customer's experience. Definitely support this place if you're in the area! Hopefully I can bump up my rating after trying more from their food menu."}
{"text":"The location, interior and view are the strength of soban. The weaknesses are a somewhat restricted menu and a very over priced menu!"}
{"text":"I came here the other night and had a really good experience. I ordered an African Nectar tea and it was delicious. My friend ordered a London Fog and he really enjoyed his drink as well.   Once you make your way up the stairs and into the restaurant you will be surprised at how nice and cozy it looks. The restaurant is much nicer than I expected it to be. They let you play board games at the table if you bring them with you and the food smelled amazing. We had already eaten dinner but I would totally go back to try their entrees and other desserts. I saw a lady eating a shaved ice dessert with tons of toppings and it looked delicious. I highly recommend this cafe if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Great place for hang outs with friends, more for teen and young adults. Friendly waiters and great but limited food list. Mainly for non-alcoholic drinks -bubble tea, coffee, tea, smoothie, Italian soda, etc. one thing that is a must is the bingsoo! Good portion and great taste!"}
{"text":"Been here several times for coffee meetings. The place is spacious and cozy, with a variety of menu choices (food & drinks). The servers there are so cute and nice :)  But two drawbacks: 1. Music is way too loud, as if it aims to cover people's voice. After all it's a cafe not a club, people are here to talk, not to listen to the music. 2. The front door always open, it lets wind come in and made the booths area freezing (it's winter time).  This place could have been better."}
{"text":"Super cute cafe in the middle of Korea Town. Not a large area, so keep your groups smaller. The height is nice but not the best view in my opinion.   Food is asthetically nice, but pretty basic. Their ice creams and cakes didn't taste fresh or Anything. Nothing was too sweet which was disappointing cause we were having a sugar craving.  Service was good,we got everything quickly and everyone who worked there was doing a good job in asking if everything was good and okay."}
{"text":"Located just right across from Finch station, this cafe definitely catches your eye even though it is located on the second floor. My friend and I ordered a strawberry shortcake ($6.99 before tax and tips) and we were expecting, like most cafes, a somewhat fresh/day of cake. The presentation was pretty nice (caramel sauce, white chocolate shavings, freshly chopped strawberries). Sadly, the only thing fresh about the cake was the freshly chopped strawberries. From the first bite, you could tell the cake was from frozen with crumbly sponge cake, very cool whip, and soggy strawberries sandwiched in between. For seven dollars, the portion and taste was definitely NOT worth it. In addition, the plate we were eating from was dropped multiple times, seen from the chipped off plate. Poor plate had to go through all that impact. Worth mentioning this place seems to be popular for studying and they do have complimentary wifi."}
{"text":"Koreans love cafe. If you visit Seoul you will see cafes that are generally nicer than the ones here. Soban is not amazing, but far from bad.  This place can get really loud depending on the time and the kind of customers you have. If you want to study here, that's not a good idea. You come here to talk. Cafe is kind of a girly thing an most of the customers are girls.   I'm a guy so I'm more interested in the food than the atmosphere. I love their shaved ice. It's not as good as the ones in Korea of course, but sufficient, and probably the best Korean style shaved ice you can get in Toronto. The drinks aren't amazing, but more than adequate. If you like tea, I think Orange Caramel nearby is much better.   I'm not the type who likes to sit and chill at a cafe. But I recommend this place anyways if you're looking for a Korean style cafe."}
{"text":"Found this cafe completely by accident - it's located on the second floor of the Yonge and Finch Shout Karaoke Bar. Spacious interior, modern aesthetic, great ambience. Noise level is quiet and the wait staff was friendly and efficient in service. The drinks my friend and I got were quite good! Will come again when in the area. Wonderful spot to have a chat."}
{"text":"Recently renovated. Decor now is modern, clean, and beautiful. New furniture that matches the new decor. Slow, soothing music playing in the background. Menu hasn't changed and their prices are the same so refer to my previous review. WiFi is amazing now.  So beautiful. Must check out."}
{"text":"Date of Visit: 2015-08-08 Bill Total (after taxes): $9.59  I always liked Soban Café because of its location on the second floor, viewing out onto the cityscape and street corner of Yonge & Finch. The previous two occasions, everything was spot on. However, on my third visit, I will not be returning.  My friend and I met up, and went to Soban. The menus were promptly given to us once we sat down at a table by the window. Once we decided, we waited for 10 minutes for the server to return. My friend had to wave her down. I placed my order first. I asked what cakes do they have today; she told me to walk over to the dessert fridge by the entrance of the café, and choose one. She didn't explain to me what cake is what, so I just chose the regular cheesecake and a cappuccino. My friend ordered the same cheesecake, and an caffé americano.  The table we sat at was wobbly, and we were afraid of the drinks spilling. Eventually, when the drinks came; neither of our drinks came with a saucer and a spoon. I asked the server for sugar, and she walked away and did not acknowledge me at all. However, she did return with two packets of sugar, a spoon, and a napkin. My friend accidentally placed his arm on the corner where the table wobbles, and a little of our drinks spilled over.  When the cheesecakes came, I was very surprised with the forks Soban provided; THEY'RE PLASTIC! My friend and I were very disappointed as we were never given plastic utensils in our previous visits.  We finished up, and we waited for the server for our bills. She never came by at all since dropping off the cheesecakes and plastic forks. We simply walked up to the front to request for our bills. My friend and I stood there, in front of the server and her co-worker.  \"Yes?\" the server said in a stern voice. I asked her for our bills to be separated, and she did so. She handed the bill to me, and said, \"$9.59\". I handed her a $20, and as she gave me the change, she did not say thank you. My friend received the same treatment as well. I placed a dollar in the tip jar, and again she did not say thank you. My friend is Korean, and he bowed and said thank you in Korean. The server did not even acknowledge nor replied in gratitude.  At that point, I was so disgusted with the service, I marched out, and waited for my friend outside. My friend was mad to the point that he did not tip at all.  I don't know why this visit was so terrible. I believe the server had a bad day. However, I cannot accept that reason at all, simply because I still tipped regardless of the server's inattentiveness and attitude. On top of that, when I tipped, she did not show any gratitude nor respect at all. No smile, no bow, no thank you.  Me: \"Should've gone to Orange Caramel instead...\" My friend: \"Ne\""}
{"text":"Pros:  -Italian soda is just right -the green tea waffle is pretty decent or what I'd expect at least  -cute and clean atmosphere -good music  Cons: -tapioca was really tasteless and kinda soggy texture -mixed fruit waffle was canned fruits, pretty disappointing for $12 -2/3 of us ordered drinks, she didn't even offer my friend who didn't order a drink water.. We had to ask for it at the end but I mean it's pretty standard to get water  Overall an alright place for late night if nothing else is open, and it seems like a good place for studying. The actual desserts and slush weren't that good though."}
{"text":"This place isn't that special and I'll probably never come again. The service is wack and the servers come off very rude like they don't give an F about their job lol. My bf and I each got a pot of teas and they weren't bad but honestly they were just tea bags with hot water. The wifi also doesn't work here. The only cool thing is that one of the workers has a sloth tattooed on her arm - that made my day."}
{"text":"This cafe is alright for what it is;  I'd say the best thing about it is that it is upstairs, and the view is right on the corner of yonge and finch! It's quite lovely at night.   Some of the drinks are moderately priced, and some a bit pricey (hot chocolates, etc) The bubble tea is okay here- not bad, but sometimes, it can be a bit chunky..? I've also tried the food- the cheese corn is not bad, but I don't think it's cheesy enough. It doesn't cover ALL the corn, so half of it is cheese corn and half of it is plain ol' regular corn. The brick toast is really good though! They give you a lot for your buck. It's stacked high, and is enough to share. I'm not usually a fan of bread, but this brick toast is especially yummy. Damn.  I'd say this is a nice place for catching up with friends, or maybe just a study date or something. The interior is pretty nice, and it's a nice quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Soban Cafe is a great spot for dessert in the heart of North York. Many selections can be found in the menu to satisfy whatever Asian dessert craving you're having! Also, the interior design and free wifi are attractive. To be honest though, I don't really remember if the wifi worked but that is NOT important gotta spend time with your friends and family alright kids get off YA PHONE  I got a Mango shaved ice which was around $10-$13 but to be honest I don't really remember, I was just so sweaty I needed something cold. Thinking that this place seemed popular and comparing it to places like Sugar Marmalade, I thought the portion would be small. I was surprised to see that it was actually quite large! (as seen in the photo) There was a lot of mangos and a LOT of ice. Overall yummy.  The reason why it lost 2 stars (would've been 5 but they dun goofed) is because their service was mehhhhhhh  Okay like we got our food pretty quick and there was no issues in ordering, but our server was sooo unenthusiastic lol. Like if I worked at a dessert restaurant I'd have a sweet attitude   anyways our server slammed the menus down when we came in and it kind of seemed like she was rushing us to order. Didn't really have a smile, even if she did it felt forced. Definitely made the experience not as good.  Regardless, the food itself was really nice and tasty so I ain't complaining about that. Definitely worth trying!!"}
{"text":"A nice little cafe to study in. Got here around 12 and was nice and quiet. The staff is friendly and attentive. Ordered the japanese styled beef and egg over rice, the dish could have been a little hotter. Also ordered a mint chocolate slush, not bad, nothing to rave about. And got an iced hazelnut latte, I liked it, not too sweet and definitely a good choice as its really warm sitting by the windows. Would come back if I need a place to study. They got busy/loud around 2 though, but good experience altogether."}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday evening after 8pm.   - There are many students/youngsters there, some of them doing homeworks, some surfing on laptop (there's outlet to charge your phone/laptop), and others chatting. The atmosphere is warm and cozy, perfect place to chill. The downside is that people tend to stay even after paying, taking up spaces. Some people had to wait outside (luckily in the building itself, not in the cold) and wait for a table.   - the staff were nice and attentive. However, service is slow. It took over 10mins for 2 simple drinks (blue lemonade and peach italian soda).   - we ordered simple drinks, so no complaint on those. They were as described. The blue lemonade has a bitter taste. I prefer the other drink more.   - menu: they offer savoury foods, desserts (macaron, cheesecake, red velvet, sagoo, ice cream) , drinks including smoothies, Italian soda, lemonade, milkshakes.   Will come back another day to try other food/drinks in the menu."}
{"text":"It's an okay place to stop by! Great place to stop by in the afternoon if you want to get some work done. Blue lemonade was okay. The place is clean and very modern. Staff were friendly."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. I have been here twice and the first time I liked the bubble tea and the matcha cheesecake but I couldn't have WiFi on my laptop since the day connection was bad, but service was good.  Tonight I went there and the service was not good-- the server basically just sat me down and forgot me. I ordered the earl grey bubble tea and it tasted nice but looked really sloppy and was spilled down the sides of the glass. I also got the red bean and matcha waffle-- biggest mistake ever! Not only did it take forever, it was cold and even looked awful. As soon as the server set it down I regretted it. It was stale tasting, dry and pasty. It also tasted like freezer burn, and I'm not sure if it was the waffle or the ice cream.   This place is really disorganized, having been a server in a past life this is what I'd recommend they do: -shorten the menu to only include things they do well -hire a manager -get a proper WiFi connection"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since I always walked passed it. Friday night, not as packed as thought. Although the rain might have help.  We ordered 3 things. - A mint chocolate and cookie shake (it was very good) - A strawberry parfait (the picture on the menu looks better than the actual dessert. It looked like sugar overload and it is. The ice cream in the middle was good but the syrup was too overpowering. My friend who really loves sweets agreed that the parfait was too sweet for her) - And a glutinous rice variation. Forgot which one it was. (It also looked as it tasted: bland. Though in truth it's likely because the parfait numbed our tastebuds) I admit, we chose poorly. I might come again for something else"}
{"text":"Sorry folks, i got the \"You are not welcome here\" vibe from them. I went there on Friday night. We got seated, kept looking at the server for a good 10 minutes for them to take our order. All of them were chilling by the counter and gave no heed. The guy behind the counter looked at us and ignored our existence, and the the two servers were just chilling with him laughing and stuff.   This is one of my biggest pet peeves in a restaurant, you can't just ignore customers like that! Fortunately, i was with somebody so i was calm, when I had enough i walked up to them with the menu in my hand and said we had been looking at you guys for quite a while waiting for you to take our order, could you please come and take our order?  Then the server came and took our order. I had hazelnut hot chocolate and my friend had peppermint tea.  I went there because i had an intense craving for hot chocolate, and i was disappointed, it was kinda watery and i didnt even finish it. Needless to say that I definitely have had better hot chocolate, second cup has better hot chocolate than them.  Won't be going back. Please learn to treat your customers properly."}
{"text":"Convenient location right by finch station. The place is located upstairs of a karaoke place and it is so cute! There is WiFi available to use and the decor is nice, clean, and very sleek. The simplicity provides a really nice ambiance to bring your laptop and study or do some work. As for food, its alright. I had the beef egg rice bowl and i didn't find it that great tasting. However, the portion was huge and it was only about $12. I had ordered a honey toast but the waitress totally forgot about it and instead packed it up in a box to-go UPSIDE DOWN with the whip cream all smeared and it looked gross. Wasn't very impressed with that but if I ever had to come and chill around finch station, I'd come here, order a drink, and sit around."}
{"text":"Soban Cafe is a cozy cafe at the busy intersection of Yonge and Finch. It is a great location since it is near many restaurants around the area. It is a perfect spot to go to before/after eating or even studying. This is a great spot to study because they have comfy sofa seats with large tables for your laptops.   Service: the service is adequate. The servers will come if you wave them down. Otherwise they will not check up on you.  Food and drinks: They have an extensive menu of drinks and desserts. I never tried their desserts here because I would rather go to other nearby dessert shops. Their drinks are okay, nothing special. Nothing from Soban really stands out to me. It is your typical cafe offering drinks and desserts.   Overall, Soban is your average cafe. Great spot if you want a cozy atmosphere though!"}
{"text":"Good service. Really good atmosphere due to location, view, and how clean and spacious it is compare to similar cafes. Clientele is young And people are here doing a variety of things, some are chatting, studying etc. which is nice.  Now for the negatives, which was not a big deal because I had good company, but note to myself never order these again: The hot taro bubble tea I ordered came out rather slow and didn't taste taro, all the purple stuff were condensed at the bottom... The vanilla thousand layer cake i ordered was not that good. The Kimchee omelette was too spicy for me and there's awfully lot of rice !!"}
{"text":"My favourite cafe in Toronto. For food, atmosphere, location - everything a cafe needs."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and each visit has left a lot to be desired. That's why I was so shocked to see all the high ratings; to each their own, but here's my two cents.  This place is quite spacious and the ambiance is nice but the drinks and service are very subpar. I've tried their original milk tea twice now, but I guess it's just supposed to taste like watered-down milk with barely any tea? The only good drink I've had here is the lychee green tea, so if you have to order something, order that.   I can't personally speak on the food but a friend did tell me about an experience she had where she received an undercooked waffle (batter spilled out when she stuck her fork in it) and then got asked if she wanted it microwaved when she complained. Like what.  The staff here also don't seem to be in any hurry to fulfill your order or serve you in general. Once I waited 20 minutes for a drink before I went up to the front to ask for it again, only to find the guy doing nothing behind the counter. After that, I resolved never to go back, no matter how convenient the location is."}
{"text":"Love this place nothing sure why ... I like to come here and do some work over the weekend specially the finch parking is free ... It is a bit loud for studying but I get work done ... I love the place well designs ... The servers are hot (the women servers).    For ordering I like the honey dew bubble tea it is such tasty tea ... Although pricy but that is the price of bubble tea in this city for some reason ... The owner is the best he will do anything for customer satisfaction ... He gave me free cheese cake for no reason such a cool guy."}
{"text":"It's official! SUMMER IS HERE!!  Bring in the shaved ice!  Friends and I got the double sized green tea shaved ice for 10$. They're definitely generous with the portion. Topped with a bountiful amount of fruits, ice cream and matcha powder, this bingsoo has quite a variety of flavours. Not a big fan of the pineapple and matcha combination, but very refreshing all the same.  Decent."}
{"text":"Caramel mocha $4.50 White chocolate macchiato $4.50 To get ice its an extra $0.50  Both tasted refreshing and not overly sweet. The only difference between the two drinks was that the white chocolate macchiato had a stronger coffee flavor.  Also got a slice of red velvet cake for $5. Tasted excellent. I'm not 100% sure but I'm pretty confident to say that the cake is the same place where Metro gets their cakes because I recently got a red velvet cake from Metro and it looked and tasted exactly the same. Even the decorative icing on the top of the cake was the same.    Service was great  Korean run cafe Had nice relaxing Korean music playing the the background"}
{"text":"Disgusting is how I would describe my experience with this place.  Coming here for the first time, my first impression of them was their bags of garbage lining the hallway leading up to their front entrance.    Against my better judgment, I went in and was seated at a table.  But soon after, the waitress came over and asked if I could move to another table so she could combine my table with 2 others for an incoming group.  OK no problem.  I moved.  The group came in and sat down at the table, looked at the menu for a few minutes, then left the cafe.    I had gone to Soban to eat and work, as were many of the other customers who were there with their laptops and books.  Most of Soban's tables are very small, however, and a number of the other customers who were working either had to be at a larger table or if they were on the small ones, had to fit their work and food on 2 tables.  I was at a small table and when my food came, I pulled up 1 of the 3 now empty adjacent small tables to fit my food.  Soon after the waitress came by and asked if I could move all of my stuff onto 1 table.  OK . . . except that she did not ask the other people taking up multiple tables to do the same thing.   Speaking of which, they say they have WiFi but not really - each time I tried to connect to their WiFi, it said \"Not Connected\".  Customers at other tables were having the same issue and all they were told was to keep trying because it's hard to connect.    After I had eaten, the waitress came by again and told me that, apparently, there is a \"2 hour limit\" rule at that cafe.  That's funny because I'm pretty sure many of the customers there had been at the cafe much longer than I had (they were there when I arrived and still there when the waitress came over to inform me about this new rule) and this 2-hour \"rule\" was not posted anywhere in the cafe, not even in their menus (which menus did, however, state that there is a minimum charge per person rule).  So basically they made up a rule to boot customers out once they had ordered their food.  In this case, the cafe was not even full - there were available tables beside me that they could have offered to new incoming customers.  The way that this place treats its customers is unbelievable.    Would never come here again and recommend that people stay away from this place.  In addition to the horrible customer treatment, the food was mediocre and for those who are lactose intolerant or who otherwise cannot drink much milk, they do not have non-dairy options for their drinks.  There are so many other similar cafes in that area with better food, better service, (working WiFi!), and don't mistreat their customers."}
{"text":"Definitely on my list of cafes to study at with some good dessert and tea. This is place is very bright, cute and elegant at the same time. It's on the second floor so you get a nice view of the busy street down below. if you're looking for a place to crank out an essay or get some studying done like I do, come on a weekday afternoon. service is friendly, music is relaxing and so on.They did update and added MANY new items on their menu because i believe they switched owners. It is now more taiwanese style like many other cafes but they offer fusion items. Have yet to order main dishes to give it a better/worse rating. But this is solely based on ambience, service, and dessert/drinks.   Recommendations:  Tropical Green Tea (hot): loose leaf tea in a tea bag. This green tea has a bit of tropical taste to it just like the name suggests. No need for milk or honey. Take it as is! It has a sweet and minty aroma so it's quite relaxing.   Oreo Cheesecake: Let's just say this is to die for. The best oreo cheesecake in town. might want to share this piece with a friend because the portion is quite large and heavy. AND might be a little bit too much cake for those ordering food. Goes great with their iced tea or italian soda!  Regular cheesecake: This place offers one of the most promising plain cheesecake anywhere around. The consistency of the texture is perfect. Not too firm, not too soft, just perfect! Again, you might want to share since it is quite heavy, unless you are a real trooper and finish it all on your own. This one goes splendidly with the tropical green tea."}
{"text":"Cafe Soban makes it to my top 3 go-to cafes nearby! I love everything about this cafe- with the exceptional of the weird entrance off to the side of the building. Once you're through the entrance and up the stairs, you'll be greeted by this cute wooden chalkboard outside of the cafe. The seats are comfortable, and the place is clean. I enjoyed the Korean music in the background. Overall, the ambience is a good 5/5!  Since it was late, my friend and I ordered dessert with drinks. I had a mango milk green tea for $3.99. Unfortunately, they ran out of tapioca. Despite the lack of bubbles, the drink was delicious! It tasted different than the typical mango milk green tea I would get from a regular bubble tea shop. I was very impressed. My friend ordered a taro slush, which was great as well.   We shared a Belgian waffle and this was amazing! We picked the choice of 2 waffles and 1 gelato. When the plate came, it was very cute and fancy with strawberries, blueberries, whipped cream and chocolate syrup on the side. The flavour we picked for the gelato was almond fudge. The waffles are simply scrumptious. All in all, I love their waffles so much!   The service was great. The server, who is learning English, tried his best to explain the menu to me and I appreciate his enthusiasm in doing so. The overall price range for this cafe is good, under $10. It's definitely worth the try if you're looking for a cute place to hang out at night!  Would I go back? MOST DEFINITELY! They have many things I want to try on the menu and the comfortable atmosphere would bring me back quite soon."}
{"text":"The presentation, quality and quantity relative to the price is fair. Nothing to complain or excited about. They have a few dessert dish that's huge portion....exciting for dessert lovers. The cafe is located on the second floor, it has a bit of a good view of the most street of Yonge/Finch. However, the owner is not able to take advantage by lowering the restaurant light in the evening to make it easy for viewing outside.  In fact, at night the light is so bright that it makes you feel like you don't want to stay for too long. Maybe it is one of their 'strategy' to have a faster turnaround of table. It may be good strategy for their business, but it certainly doesn't attract me to come back again."}
{"text":"cheese cake is ok but the London fog juz so so. The location is very comfortable and good view of Finch and Yonge."}
{"text":"I saw this cute and bright lited cafe at the corner of Yonge and Finch last night and thought I'd check it out with my friend. We were on a bubbletea crave and wanted to try a small local cafe in the area. As we approached the Soban cafe it seemed as if we walked into some small gem somewhere in Asia. The place was clean and modern. For such a small piece of space they did a great job in utilizing what they had and maximized it. We chose a seat close to the window overlooking the busy Yonge strip. It felt cozy escaping the rain.    The menu offers a wide selection of drinks from slush, milk tea, hot tea, herbal tea and smoothies. However, the menu did not impress me too much only a few items stood out to me, their specialty drink Orea Milk Tea and shaved iced desserts. The menu looked over priced, fruit waffle was $12.99 and to my very disappointment the Chocolate Mint Truffle Hot Tea was merely a Mighty Leaf tea bag which cost me $4.99. I mean... I could have bought a box of Mightly Leaf myself and it would've lasted me a month for $4.99. I also ordered a Honey Butter Brick Toast ($6.99). I never tried a honey butter version, since most places serve it with sweet condensed milk. To my surprise again, it was way too much toast to scruff down by one person. The butter to honey ratio was 80/20. It felt like I was drinking a stick of melted butter and the oily texture did not settle well in my stomach at all. My friend simply ordered a banana bubble milk tea ($4.99) that she thought was an interesting flavour they had. I tried some and it tasted like medicine. She also felt her stomach stir. Honestly, never again!!! All the items we ordered were very disappointing. The only 2 employees that were working were not very attentive, either they didn't want to be working or did not want our service. Koodos to their high rating on Yelp but I likely will not recommend this place to anyone or go back there ever again. Sorry but NOT SORRY."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this cafe this weekend on the corner of Yonge and Finch. As it is upstairs, you need to go from the side entrance. When we entered, place was quite nice and bright. There were quite a bit of tables studying and others just chilling. There was quite a selection of drinks, appetizers and desserts. Prices were quite typical. We tried the cheese corn and a lychee iced tea. Both items weren't bad, no complaints. I thought the iced tea was a good size and refreshing. Overall, nice place to go for studying or chilling after a meal."}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed my moments of studying at this place. Apart from the good view of the busy streets below, their coffee is actually good and unpretentious. The servers are nice and courteous. And I haven't encountered a boisterous crowds yet, thanks heavens!"}
{"text":"Ambience was nice, the view of yonge and finch was nice, the servers were nice. But waffles were overpriced and NOT fresh  My boyfriend ordered waffle with nuts and hazlenut hot chocolate and I ordered waffle with mixed fruits with original milk tea.    Drinks came out first. It was delicious! The waffles were horrible. I felt like they were not fresh at all.  His waffle with nuts was basically waffles with icecream and trail mix on top. Stuff that u get from shoppers drug mart which included peanuts, raisins, seeds, cashews, and almonds.  Mine had fresh kiwi, bananas and maybe fresh strawberries.. The raspberries and blueberries were frozen! And the rest of the fruit they used was from fruit cup.   If I am going to pay 11.99 I expect it to be just as good as cafe Demetre which only charges 11.5 for their waffles. Even though drinks were good I wouldn't come back, chatime is cheaper and just as good.  Sorry wouldn't come back here"}
{"text":"My friend and I had the Beef/Egg/Kimchi rice bowl and the Taiwanese popcorn chicken rice bowl. Both were delicious. We were actually surprised because we thought this was just known for their desserts. We got the Mango smoothie and Coconut milk tea for dessert and the Mango smoothie was great but the Coconut milk tea tasted too much like syrup. However the tapioca bubbles had the perfect chew to it. We ordered through UberEATS and the food arrived on time and still hot. We will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"My friend and I accidentally found Soban Cafe because we were around Finch Station and heading towards Chatime or another bubble tea place. However, we wanted to try Soban because we haven't seen this place before. The stairs to Soban are located on the right side of the building. They weren't too hard to find.  We arrived at around 8:00 p.m. on a Wednesday night, and it wasn't busy yet. We were seated down very quickly. However, to my surprise, this place is quite popular, and all the tables were filled by around 9:00 p.m. Soban has a very simple but appealing menu, with a variety of drinks: lattes, hot chocolate, milk tea, black and green tea, Italian soda, and lemonade.  They also have food options, but I did not have a chance to try any. You will definitely find something you like.   My friend decided to order the peach Italian soda, and I ordered the hazelnut hot chocolate. My friend really enjoyed her soda, and did not have any complaints for it. To be honest, I'm not too big of a fan of hot chocolate, but I really liked this drink. Although there was more foam than I expected, it really complemented the chocolate flavour. In addition, the four marshmallows on the top were very soft and made the drink look very visually appealing. At first, I was a bit disappointed with the price because it was about $4.99. However, the cups they have are relatively big, so I felt that it really justified the price. The Italian soda was also the same price, but I thought that it was just in a regular glass you get at restaurants. Thus, you probably get more of a drink if you order a latte, milk tea, or hot chocolate.  My friend and I were a bit disappointed at the end because the service was really slow as Soban got busy. We asked for the bill, and the server came back after two minutes to ask me what I ordered since she forgot. Then, she proceeded to serve other customers and forgot about the bill until we reminded her again. Unfortunately, like most Asian places, they charge $0.25 more if you use a credit or debit card to pay. They do split bills willingly, which is great. Just remember to carry cash if you come.  Overall, I'd recommend coming to Soban Cafe because it's a great place to sit down and have a conversation with your friends. I would suggest coming in groups of 2 to 4."}
{"text":"My friends and I were craving some sweets after dinner and spontaneously decided on Soban as we were passing by.  You enter from the side of the venue and walk up stairs. You pass by their washrooms on your walk to the cafe: one women's and one men's washroom stall. It smelled disgusting and they ran out of toilet paper....  At the cafe, we were allowed to sit wherever we wanted because it was only half full. I opted for Fruit crushed ice and it was AMAZING. I recommend it to everyone who wants something sweet. The ice had some sort of sweet drizzled over, and it was topped with cuts of kiwi, strawberry, cherries, and more. It had a large scoop of strawberry ice cream drizzled in what I believe was condensed milk, as well as a strawberry drizzle as well. It was soooo good. I would go back and get through the mediocre customer service just to have this dessert again.   That being said, my friend was served a cake slice without any utensils, so I had to ask for them and they were wet when I got them....also, they don't do cafe art like some other cafes in the areas. My friend enjoyed her matcha latte though. The cake was also highly praised. Great food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nice cafe to hang out and talk to your friends. Decent prices"}
{"text":"Nice cafe to hang out with friends. The entrance is at the north/west corner of Finch/Yonge.  Service was great and the staff were all so polite.   Lots of drinks (bbt, latte, coffee, hot chocolate etc.) and desserts on the menu. I noticed they also serve Dufflet cakes. There is a 2 hr seating limit.   I had the... Hazelnut hot chocolate - nothing special and as expected.  Plain cheese cake - The filling was made well. It was soft and rich. But the crust could have used more graham cracker. It was barely there."}
{"text":"Love the location, great 2nd floor view of the busy street and people walking their lives.  Loved the double waffle and scoop of chocolate gelato combo. Also had an amazing latte.  Studied and just spent time alone. Nice and fairly quiet. Music was a great mix of current tracks and Korean songs.  One thing I disliked were the tables by the window. Squeaky and almost loose. Other than this, would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I have been in this place for many times, servers are very passionate for service and foods are very delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here after hearing a lot of great things about it from friends. In short, it was definitely as good as people made it out to be. Some of the desserts here I have never seen before in any other cafes, and what stood out to me especially was the Oreo inspired creations (massive Oreo fan here), so I had to try those out.  I ordered the Oreo cheesecake while my friends got the double fruit bingsoo and Oreo parfait, respectively. We were all blown away by how gorgeous each dessert look, and more importantly, how awesome they tasted. This is definitely one of those places where you can take a picture, add it to your Snapchat or IG story, and get a ton of replies from people asking \"where is this???\" and \"jelly!\"."}
{"text":"My favorite cafe in town. gotta admit, the first time i went there i was a bit annoyed because the server was new and wasnt really familiar with the menu but the other times were super nice. i love it. but ive heard from my friends that its a bit pricey for them, but me i find the price appropriate for the service and product offered."}
{"text":"I really don't recommend this place. Came here last summer because the pictures online looked so good so I decided to try it... ordered their signature Oreo crushed ice, pink velvet cake, and maybe green tea toast because their kitchen was closed (short staffed) so I couldn't order rice cake.  The Oreo crushed ice was a giant bowl of tap water ice cubes... not shaved ice and not flavored at all. They didn't put enough condense milk on top either so it actually tasted bitter towards the bottom (u know the taste when ice has been in the fridge for too long). Also it got stuck together like a giant block so we had to use our spoon to smash it.  We wanted the Mille crepe on the menu but it was sold out. The pink velvet cake was a disaster. It probably has been in the display case for a week. The icing and cake were both really dry.  The toast was less than average. Toasted wonder bread with whipped cream, condense milk and green tea powder.. all I can say is wtf..   I gave it 2 star because of the location and atmosphere. Will not return ever. Really do not recommend."}
{"text":"Me and my friend both ordered latte and stayed to study for fee hours, I wouldn't say it's a great place to get nice coffee but not so bad for studying :)  Overall we had quite good experience with the staff and the environment but there's nothing that would make me wanna be there again..."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it's a good place to chill and get some work done.  Located with the entrance on the corner of yonge and finch, the cafe gets pretty packed with Korean college kids studying with their laptops out. I also came here for work as I remember their ambiance was pretty chill. Their music selection went from chill/indie to dance/rave-ish though LOL.  Drinks are pretty expensive here lol. Around $5 for coffee/tea. I ordered a peach black tea expecting it to be hot but the server gave it out cold lol, and then ordered another mocha and then she asked if I wanted it hot or cold?? The iced peach tea was pretty sweet and yummy, but the mocha was average. I wanted to take the mocha later to go and I thought she'd help take it for me and put it in a cup but gave me a foam cup and I spilled half of it over the table lol woops. Their dessert menu looks good though!   New modern furniture!! I didn't notice it right away since I haven't been here in a while but I'm totally digging their new look. Clean granite (?) countertops and new chairs with glazing to divide the space into 2 sections. Now if only they could renovate their washrooms as well....."}
{"text":"This is a good spot up at Finch to study/catch up with friends for hours - just don't expect too much from the food. Came here on a weekend afternoon and it was easy to get a comfy booth. The decor is cute and clean, and the staff are friendly. There is a 2hr sitting limit per order though it's not strictly enforced when the cafe isn't busy. My friend and I got a milk tea, peppermint tea, and a cheesecake - all decently sized/priced but average in taste. Overall, this was a much more relaxing and spacious spot than Chatime down the road."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday night with one of my friends and we were both unimpressed after the visit. We had the following:   1. Mango Real Fruit Smoothie ($5.99) I asked the server beforehand to make sure that it really is real fruit and that it's blended with ice and not milk and if there was anything else added. She confirmed that it's real fruit and said there was nothing else and I was excited for the drink. When it arrived, it was overly sweet! Way too sweet for my tastebuds! Either they added sugar and failed to mention it or the mangos were just super ripe. I think it was the former. Needless to say, I didn't finish it.  2. Oreo Crushed Ice ($8.99) The reason why we came in the first place - our friend's photo of this looked promising. Nonetheless, it was a big letdown. The ice was too hard and we were doing our best to chip away at it so that we could enjoy the other layers but we gave up at some point and everything melted. The ice cream was average and the Oreos are just Oreos. If the ice had been easier to consume, this could've been a good thing. Alas!  3. Pink Velvet Cake ($4.99) And we thought there couldn't be anything worse. We were wrong! This cake slice tasted so so so dry - like it has been on display for quite some time. The layers reminded me of carrot cake and the icing tasted like coconut. This combination doesn't work.   4. Green Tea Brick Toast ($6.99) This was probably the only half decent thing that we tried. The toast came with some whipped cream on the top and it had already been cut into cubes so it was easy to eat - we just stick our fork into one of the cubes and enjoy! The fact that it was pre-cut also helped the flavour because the condensed milk seeped between the cracks making it quite moist. There was a top layer of green tea but you couldn't taste it much because it was overpowered by the condensed milk.   The service was a disaster to say the least. I feel sorry for the server because although she was quite nice, she was the only one working! We wanted to get some items from the kitchen but she couldn't make them because she had to stay outside. Whoever decided they should offer hot food but not have someone there to make it is a poor excuse for a manager. She was also inattentive as a result of there being quite a few tables - a few too many for one person to handle alone. Furthermore, the washroom was disgusting. There was no separate container for female hygiene products and while this isn't to say that there is a problem with a girl having her period, but I just don't want to be seeing the discards of someone else's period while I'm trying to go. This place was a disappointment and I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"I only come here because it's close to my condo. Last time i came, their wifi didn't work, and today i was going to have some light food and do some work on my laptop. But their music was so loud and messy, i couldn't concentrate at all! Seriously? This is a coffee bar not a pub, please play something that people would enjoy over coffee!"}
{"text":"I give this place a 3.5. I came here on a late Sunday afternoon. The place got jam packed within an hour with 99% Korean costumers by 6 pm. I was supposed to meet my friends here to study, but I would not recommend it, cause the place gets really loud. The door was completely hidden and I had to walk around and ask where the entrance is from the restaurant downstairs. Here you can order bubble tea in either the regular cold version or you can get a latte with tapioca and call it a warm bubble tea. I went for the mocha latte, which came in a fancy mug. It tasted like any other regular mocha you can get anywhere. Their red velvet cake was fresh and delicious. What I didn't like about this place was that their internet was not working properly and when asked why, they told us that there's too many people sucking the wifi out.  I would probably come here again when it's less busy on a weekday. Also, you have to pay for parking at the back, which sucks."}
{"text":"The interior and pictures of the food and drinks make this place inviting but the service was lacking! I came here with a group of friends hoping to have a good meal and space to study for a bit.   First off, there is a minimum order of 1 per person and a 2 hour seating limit. It was very obvious that they were keeping track of our 2 hours because they handed us our bill when half of us weren't even finished!  The server we had seemed impatient. Our group was kinda indecisive about what to order because as students, these foods seemed pretty overpriced. We were all kinda looking back at each other like \"they're charging like $13 for a sandwich ??\". The waiter kept asking us if we were ready to order and kept walking near our table as we were deciding what to order, this made us pretty uncomfortable.  When we have finally ordered and the food has arrived, we were kinda disappointed. The portions are pretty small and the drinks weren't anything special. They were average, I suggest just going to the food stall right outside because the food there was a lot better and a lot more cheaper! Like our total came to like $54 when we order like 3 drinks n 2 appetizers! Might as well go to a mcdonalds and get full just for $20. Also, the server was pretty rude. We paid in cash and coins (mostly because we are students and had to split the bill) and we took like about 2-3 minutes to make sure we had the exact amount in change. Once we gave it to the waiter, he got really stressed that we gave that much amount in cash and coins. He took over 15 minutes just to count it all and had to get help from like 3 other people working there! Then once it was all done he tells us that we are \"missing money\". He didn't even bother telling us what our total was. He comes back a few minutes later saying we are missing $5 even thought I clearly remember each one of us in the group counting our total. We were all pretty impatient and pissed off with the amount of time wasted just counting our money so we paid the extra $5 and left.   Overall, this is the place if you want to get scammed with overly priced and average food. Definitely not coming back and not someplace I'd recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Cafe Soban may now be the place for me to hang out and chill while waiting for my date!  Black Sesame Seed Latte ($4.49)! Need I say more?!  Right at the Corner of Yonge and Finch, talking about location!  Plush comfy seatings... with tons of booth seatings overlooking Yonge or Finch, talking about scenery!  Fast, reliable WIFI and with tons of outlets. I usually hang out at Starbucks across the street but lately their wifi never works!  Not too busy but does have Kpop as background... if that's not your thing, maybe you need some ear plugs."}
{"text":"This is the worst place I've ever been in the GTA. The waitress took me 30 minutes to finish talking the order. The beverage and desserts totally sucked. Such a waste of money and time."}
{"text":"A nice cafe on the upper level. A bit small, yet comfortable place. The menu didn't have anything special on it: some Belgian Waffles with ice cream, some cakes, bubble teas, etc.   I had the Belgian Waffle with green tea ice cream, my friend had their honey bread brick. Both were really good, though the honey bread may be too sweet for some; it was smothered in honey (we both have a sweet tooth). Prices were standard, I paid $10, she paid $7.  Menu was small, could use some more variety and choice. Overall, nice place. I'd go back."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and it looks like they've changed ownership or management already because the menu has changed and so have the prices. Speaking of which, it's pretty expensive now! Every drink is $4 or up for even an espresso. Also, they have a minimum order limit of one per person. The inside is pretty nice though and service was efficient. I probably won't return as the prices aren't justified by the product."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try which is right on Yonge and finch. The location is really nice. It's on the second floor and if you sit near the big window you get a nice view.  We ordered the Taro Milk tea with green apple jelly and green tea shaved ice. The drink was delicious. The shaved ice came with a huge scoop of green tea ice cream, some fruit, shaved ice, beans and matcha powder. They sprinkled too much match powder over the ice, which got bitter really quick. Even though the portion size was really big, it consisted mostly of ice-cream and not enough shaved ice. This was not flavourful at all.  The place was a bit pricey but the costumer service was good. There are better cafes nearby which are cheaper and serve more flavourful shaved ice. Will not be going back there!"}
{"text":"Friend brought me here the other day for late night bubble tea.. I had the Tao Milk black tea and it was great.. there was only one size to choose from which happened to be the perfect size, the Tapioca was fresh. My friend said this place was newly renovated and from the photos posted i would have to agree, they have new bench type seating, and free wi-fi. The bathroom was out in the hall and could have been a little more up to date. Other than that great little place for late night relaxing."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I am always satisfied coming here! Soban always has a good selection of cakes, waffles, and drinks to choose from. Their bingsoo Is also very good as well. It's fairly priced and the interior is modern and classy, not to mention a good view of the street. Service is pretty good too! But beware of coming here on weekend or holiday nights, you might not get a table!  I highly recommend you to come here and try the dessert, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'd come back to Soban is because of the convenient location. The sandwich I ordered was 80% cabbage with a microscopic slice of ham. There's an overwhelming selection of drinks, but they're mostly just overpriced and average tasting at best. The wifi also wasn't working and the music was deafening.  At least the waitress was attentive."}
