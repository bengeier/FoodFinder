{"text":"Very classy restaurant in Madison. The food was excellent. This was the perfect place for our anniversary meal. The ambiance was great especially thanks to the subtle live music. My only compliant was that the bread served at the beginning of the meal was lackluster and did not belong in the same class of food as the appetizer and entr√©e. I highly recommend the turtle dove cheesecake for desert."}
{"text":"The Lady cut prime rib was cooked perfectly (I had it rare. My husband ordered his medium rare and it was a bit overdone.) Veggies were a medley or nicely sweet glazed carrots with a maple syrup sauce.

Warm crabmeat appetizer was tasty but bland. Could use a splash of hot sauce. (They'll bring you some if you ask.) Portion was okay for a couple people but not enough for our party of 4 adults.

All desserts were very good: nicely tart key lime pie, derby pie with chocolate and nuts and cheesecake (get it with raspberry or strawberry topping). Portions big enough for 2-3 to share.

Live music duo was playing on the Friday night we were there."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Was really looking forward to eating here. Showed up and they're a closed down business."}
{"text":"A fantastic find on the west end of main street in historic Madison....amazing staff...concise yet complete menu....most everything house made and locally sourced.

The staff were efficient, friendly and fun...dealing with aplomb the smart ass that is moi...I enjoy interaction with staff and to hear their stories...so I appreciate the gregariousness of the staff and owners

Food..amazing !

Bourbon (and micro beer) offerings were amazing !  as good or better than the big cities...truly the best bourbon list I have ever seen...including some Pappy Van Winkel  or Winkle...whatever....enjoyed a flight of four bourbons as chosen by the owner....excellent choices....nice to be the beneificiary of an incredibly well  informed bourbon enthusiast !

Great entertainment on the deck....live music on the back deck..that was at the perfect volume !!  great job !

.....also....perfect portions...not these giant gut busting bigger is always better chain responses to competition

People...check this place out...well worth a road trip !"}
{"text":"Great drink special.  $3 Martini's.  Excellent Bourbon selection and fair prices.  Food was ok.  They did not have any Prime Rib on my visit, even though it was on the menu.  Had a ribeye instead.  Perfectly cooked.  Service was not very professional.  Salad came out on a very warm plate.  Dessert was very good.  Still, service was a big concern as well as the sun light that was blinding.  The lady in the table next to us had to wear her sunglasses the whole time."}
{"text":"This stylish restaurant had live music that we enjoyed while waiting on our food.  The staff were very friendly and made you feel at home.

The special this evening was the seabass with mango salsa and asparagus.  It was very good.  

This place had great food, wine and music.  What more can you ask for in a date night?  I will have to eat and hang out here any and every time I'm in Madison."}
