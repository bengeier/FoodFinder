{"text":"What a meal, Chicken & Waffles, for a food truck they rank up there with the others,"}
{"text":"I checked out the Southpark Eats Alternative today, which is just a food truck rally that they have every Wednesday from 11am-2pm and came across a truck that I've never heard of......Comfort Foods on Wheels......featuring a soul food menu of shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles, pork chops, and fish.   While talking to the owner I found out he was the owner of the old Ruby's Dinner Club in Concord......very nice guy, and very good food.  I ordered the fish and fries which were both good......the fish was whiting fillets(3 pieces) that was well seasoned but just a tad too peppery for me, but it was still good.  I heard the wings were really good so I plan to try those on my next visit."}
{"text":"Talk about good food!  The Charlotte Food Fight entry was a boneless pork chop cooked with 10 herbs/spices, bourbon and  cloister honey. Also on the plate was an amazing Sweet Potato Casserole and bread Pudding - both just melted in your mouth. It was like an early Thanksgiving dinner! Great flavors and great textures.  Definitely one of my favorite trucks of the day!!!"}
