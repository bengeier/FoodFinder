{"text":"We had a really nice dinner here on a Saturday evening as a promo from an Internet deal gone bad.  Didn't know what to expect but were very pleased with our experience.  The central courtyard dining was really nice and was easily quiet enough for nice conversation.  My wife had the Salmon and I had the Tequila Chicken and we were very happy with both entrees.  The wine selections were not extensive but were a pretty good mix - better than most places.  Our server was Jon and was very pleasant and attentive to our every need.  He didn't hover but showed up at just the right times.  He suggested the Vanilla Napoleon desert and it was just great.  We felt that the prices were very reasonable for what we received.  The parking was in a well lit garage and the restaurant validated the ticket - so Free!  I think we will put the Great American Grill on our list when looking for a good reasonably priced dinner downtown before theater or other events.  Also - the light rail stop is right outside."}
{"text":"For what it is--a place to land when you are just looking for a relaxing dinner with a beer--, this place is terrific. Great IPA. Nice waiter, and a good hummus wrap with really excellent grilled side veggies. Pleasant ambience. Just right."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant located in the HIlton Garden Inn because a friend had given us a restaurant.com coupon.  We discussed it with the server before we ordered; when the bill came and we gave it to her along with my credit card, she said we couldn't use the coupon because we had only ordered one entree (my wife ordered a full salad).  Nothing on the coupon said this, but she didn't care.  \"Come back again and you can order two entrees,\" she said smugly.  Right.  

I had a Tbone pork chop and mashed sweet potatoes which were good to very good.  The Thai salad my wife ordered was not good.  

I don't recommend this restaurant for service or food quality."}
{"text":"Stayed in the hotel for a conference and did not feel like going out to eat. Ordered the caprese salad. Pretty safe bet, right? 5 tiny cubes of mozzarella with 3 cherry tomatoes.  I also ordered the buffalo wings. It was hard to describe the texture but imagine if the chicken had been soaking in water all day and then put in the fryer for 30 seconds. It was weird and mushy and made me question the safety of eating it. The ranch dressing that came with it was also so watery that it dripped off of the carrot stick so that only a thin whitish film remained.  

I ordered a side of arugula because I like to eat it with my caprese salad. This was good thinking because it ended up being the only (sort of) substantial thing I ate that night.

Service was great, though. 

Less than a 10 minute walk away is Switch Restaurant, an IHOP and a bunch of other places. Eat there instead."}
{"text":"Monday night, I was starving. I rarely eat at the hotel; 95% of the time I eat out. Gives me a chance to get away and not feel so cooped up. The closest place I wanted to eat was 15 minutes away. I decided to eat here at the hotel in the Great American Grill. Big mistake....

From the time I got to my room till about 15 minutes later when I decided I wasn't going anywhere, the restaurant apparently became much busier (grammar?--I'm tired) and the wait for food was 30-35 minutes according to the person taking my order. Amazing....!! I was starving and willing to wait as it would've been about the same time to drive somewhere and order and I was tired. Monday's are long travel and work days, waking up at 4am to be at the airport by 5:30am, you travelers know how that is!!!

I ordered the Tuscan Ragout and it made my mouth water. I was starving mind you...it came with a side salad. I said I would go downstairs to pick it up to save a little money. 30 minutes later, I went downstairs and waited a few more minutes until it was brought out and I paid. Got back upstairs, began to eat and it tasted like crap. Normally when you are starving, liver tastes good. This wasn't liver, it was supposed to be several steps up but it might as well have been dung. I was extremely disappointed. What was supposed to be a simple meal made me mad at myself for not going out, even though I was very tired. I didn't get back to the hotel till 7:30pm and hadn't eaten in about 7 hours. Oh well, lesson learned. Stay away from this dish. Maybe the salmon or steak is okay, but you are much better off exploring the town and eating some local cuisine."}
{"text":"We arrived at the hotel a bit late, and chose to dine at the hotel's restaurant, Great American Grill.  I have to say that the service by Todd (?) was quite good, but the hub and I were disappointed in the food.  Right out of the gate, the water tasted rusty and salty, and the food we ordered left much to be desired.  Todd was profusely apologetic about the water and immediately brought us a bottled water.

The hub ordered the Steak and shrimp, with the steak done medium well (don't even ask me why he ruins a piece of meat like that, but he does).  Anyway, the steak came back medium rare...well, barely medium rare, more like rare, so we sent it back to get refired.  Before doing that, however, we had to taste one of the three shrimp that were on the plate...

After about a 20 minute wait, we got the steak back, and it was better - cooked to medium.  We were told that they decided to start from scratch and cook the whole dish over, but because we ate one shrimp, they only sent out two shrimp with the \"new\" dish.  I had to laugh about that.

I do have to say, that while dinner that night was disappointing, the Grill remedied the errors by comp-ing our dinner that evening.  They really do try on the customer service angle.  Maybe it's time to either re-train the cooks, or hire new ones!"}
{"text":"The Good:
My chicken flat bread was tasty
Service was good and fast
There's a full bar

The Bad
Food selection was limited
Ambiance lacking

The Skinny: 
If you're staying at one of the three adjacent hotels (Drury, Extended Stay, and Hilton Garden Inn) this is a great alternative to Waffle House, or going out somewhere, or having pizza brought in.  


I was staying at the Drury Hotel and I hadn't eaten all afternoon. So at 7:30 PM I asked the front desk attendant if the Waffle House across the street was still open.  Trying to save me food trauma, she said, \"Ugh, no, stay away...their food all tastes stale with lots of grease...\" With that, she added the small cafe inside Hilton Garden Inn next door was a better bet.  Several of the guests who just returned from there said they liked the food there. So, I'm glad I listened.  

The place is tiny and part of the bright lighted hotel lobby.  So, it's not great ambiance wise.  It's got a large screen TV, like a mini sports bar, with a bunch of guys at the bar away from their spouses, with jokes and alcohol that flowed freely. I just wanted something to eat.  The selection was limited,  lots of sandwiches but there were some items that I definitely was interested in.  I wanted either the grilled chicken sandwich with fries for about $11, or the spicy chicken flat bread for about $10. I asked the waitress for her recommendation, and she said, \"Hands down the flat bread, there is a lot more flavor.   And she was right.  

It's a perfect size for most people, though my 22 year old 6'4\" Samoan nephew would want three.  Anyway, it's got white chicken cubes and cheese atop sliced carrots, cilantro, and green onions with a sweet and hot chili paste at the crisp crusted bottom. It was topped with a mayo-chili tomato sauce. I wanted an IPA with it.  But I had to walk 100 yards to my hotel full of SWAT officers driving in and staying the night. Anyway, the waitress was good about refilling my coke, and was prompt  bring the check when I was done.    

Meanwhile, the Waffle House was as empty at 7:30 as it was 8:00 when I walked by.  No grease for me tonight."}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet wasn't too bad. Had an omelet made. Self serve potatoes, bacon, sausage, fruit, thought were all decent. Cereal and baked goods too. All for about ten bucks isn't too shabby."}
{"text":"This review is for breakfast only - 
Their breakfast buffet seems reasonably priced for a hotel ($12.50 I believe) and it is a decent option.
It includes drinks (coffee, tea, juice, milk, chocolate milk, etc) , pastries, fruit, yogurt, scrambled eggs, bacon/sausage, potatoes.
They will also make you an omelette if you request it. 

They had a tray in the buffet with cold cuts, cheeses and artichoke, so it gave me the idea to order an artichoke/cheese omelette and it was delicious.

Our server was very nice and friendly. I would recommend this place if it is practical for you to have your breakfast there."}
{"text":"Artichoke dip was not an option on the menu. Other options seemed unappealing. Disappointing with ice rain and not wanting to go out"}
{"text":"Summary: Decent Food, Understaffed

This is a bit of an odd setup. There was no hostess stand, so I had to wander in and just sit down. The servers were busy preparing tables and took a few minutes to notice me. I wasn't the only one who was thrown off by this setup. I'm waiting for the waiter to come back so I can get pay my bill and there are confused people wandering through trying to find the servers.

The menu is limited, but there were a couple decent steak options. I tried the ribeye and it was tasty. I wish it were seasoned as well as the asparagus and potatoes it came with. It did have a nice hint of butter and was cooked well."}
{"text":"Bethany and Michelle are wonderful hosts and very accommodating. The hotel is located just north of the downtown area and has a beautiful bar area. Food is delicious and the peach ginger soda is amazing!"}
{"text":"Located in the lobby of the Hilton Suites in downtown Phoenix, I was fully unimpressed with their hotel restaurant. In contrast to the beautiful atmosphere of the restaurant, the food was pretty lousy.  From my room I could just smell the bacon in the morning so I had to come downstairs and give this place a try.  The restaurant is buffet style for breakfast.  The food was barely warm and hard as a rock.  The quality of the food was much worse than the free breakfasts that come complimentary at other hotel chains such as La Quinta.  At least the service was good.  I think they refilled my drink after each sip I took!  They must have known I was going to need it to wash that food down.

I'll give 2 stars only because the service was great and the atmosphere was pleasant."}
{"text":"It was snowing tonight, being from California, I'm scared of the rain... so you can imagine how terrified I must have been with the snow.

So, needless to say, I didn't feel like going out tonight so I dined at Great American Grill.  I ordered a LOT (seriously). I wanted to sample a little bit of everything and when I go on trips I have NO RESERVATIONS (unless it's a fancy restaurant, haha!).

My order:
1) HOT WINGS
2) CHEESE FRIES
3) SUPREME PIZZA
4) SAUSAGE PIZZA
5) ARTICHOKE DIP
6) APPLE COBBLER w/ VANILLA BEAN Ice Cream

Yes... I can't believe I ate the whole thing... haha, not really a lot of it was packed up and I plan on picking away at it as the week progresses.

Nothing stuck out as outstanding... everything tasted sub-par to me... the hot wings were not marinated well in the buffalo sauce... each bite was all buffalo sauce followed by bland chicken.

The cheese fries were unmemorable... the cheese did not convincingly stomp a huge footprint of flavor over the fries.  Bleh.

The Supreme Pizza and Sausage Pizza were freshly prepped but the crust was neither soft nor crunchy--it had no identity... the ingredients didn't taste fresh either.

The Artichoke dip was good!  The best part of the meal actually but not enough to save the dinner... I would say that on some levels the artichoke here is as good as it is at California Pizza Kitchen (just to give it some comparison).

Finally, the Apple Cobbler.. I had MAJOR expectations for this.  Bleh, the cobbler tasted microwaved.. the crumples were inconsistently dispersed across the apple--some parts were too crunchy, others were too soggy.  The ice cream was good, but there wasn't enough of it to cover every bite.

Great American Grill is perfect if you don't feel like going out... because it's really your only option here at the Hilton... however, I strongly suggest that if you can muster any ounce of courage to run out into the snow that you do so, because just a couple miles each direction of the Grill you'll find much better food at much more reasonable prices."}
