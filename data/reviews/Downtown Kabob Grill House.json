{"text":"Ordered takeout - food came cold, bland and terrible. None of the standard side dishes for Iranian dishes (tomatoes). Called and complained, and the man was generally pissed off. Said he would send another meal with tomatoes and all, but when it came back it was exactly the same. Won't consider it ever again."}
{"text":"This place is great. Meats perfectly seasoned and cooked over charcoal, nice ambiance and the owner lady (? I think) is absolutely lovely. I will be back. Outstanding."}
{"text":"In fact, I don't want to give any star for this restaurant. I am sorry for this while I think I have to tell you that. I placed my order through taste away about 40 minutes ago, and I went to pick up my order 20 mins ago. I gave the credit as my food was on time and ready to pick up when I arrived.   My order according to menu is Gheyman Plate, as stated in its description: veal stew, includes rice or fries, and soup or salad.                             It does sounds good, but but but the food is just too bad. I'm not lying to you, the stew got 3-4 slices finger tip size meat and hardly identified as veal. The taste of the meat like stuff is so-dry & awfully weird. There is no way it is something stew.   More than that, I found fries in my stew! Yeah, you hear me right and clear! They put fries in my stew. The stew comes along with fries literately! The taste of the soup in the stew is bad bad bad and I couldn't take a second sip.  Trust me, I can identify whether it is weird or simply bad.  I strongly suggest you NOT go to this restaurant, if you do, DON'T order the stew like dishes at least.  The people in the house doesn't looks as evil as the food though.  Not to mention the fries from the house is no good, or the salad (I chose Coleslaw and my girlfriend just tried one bite of it then quit eating)."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious and their staff are super friendly. Ask for their fresh \"Tahdig\" if they have any. I like their cuisines more."}
{"text":"Awesome food... it's great to have something healthy to eat in the late evening. This is now one of my go to restaurants for a late evening meal! Charcoal grill is also a major plus... Love it!"}
{"text":"(maybe 2.5 stars)  I decided to give this place another go since I was in the area. This time I had the skewered chicken leg in a wrap  - a large whole wheat flour pita/tortilla hybrid.  The chicken was timidly marinated BUT it was very tender and juicy.. it was also grilled very well allowing the mild flavours to shine through.  Update on hot sauce situation - I got some very mild hot sauce in the wrap, along with some pretty bland tzatziki and hummus. Nothing very spicy nor flavourful.. but I also got a home-made habenero/ginger/garlic/lime hot sauce blend they offer separately in little containers.  Wow, this was quite hot and packed a wicked zing with the lime and ginger.. the acidity of the lime, \"pepperiness\" of the ginger and the heat of the habeneros made this sandwich work..  This place still lacks cohesion (menu options like \"Persian spaghetti\", jerk chicken  and condiment options like yellow mustard and ketchup for the kabob) gives the impression of trying too hard to be all things to all people..while trying to be an  authentic Persion grill place really just ends up timid and 'westernized' to a McDonald's-eating demo (if you know the Jamestown hood you know what I mean).  Still, it was much better than last time.. the sandwich was $7.99 + tax and the portion was quite large.    Oh, and do not get the beef koobideh.. still looked like the same bland dish as before.  Did not have any sides but the diced cuke & tomato salad and rice looked pretty good.  They come with the dinner platters (about $9-$19)  and the portions look very large."}
{"text":"Very tasty, will go again.  Meats are made to order, so it will take a bit longer but worth the wait for freshly charcoal grilled food."}
{"text":"I've been to the place 2 times. Once they didn't have what I wanted. The other time the order took super long.   Either way, I was happy with the food as the portion sizes were large! And the food is decent enough. It's never busy there.   They offered to deliver to me for free as I lived 5 mins from them.   They have a home made hot sauce which is to die for! Can't remember if they charged me extra for it though so make sure to ask.  I gave it a 4 and not a 5 because it doesn't seem like they care too much about service of customer satisfaction but I don't have any proof of this. Just how they made me feel. The workers were friendly and great. Just not sure about the gentleman who appears to be the owner or manger."}
{"text":"Lived by this place for a year and never thought to try it. A friend of mine recently introduced me to Iranian cuisine and now I can't get enough of this place.  The woman who runs (owns?) this place is absolutely delightful. She is very helpful, happy and makes great suggestions.  I mainly go for the kabobs and rice but have tried various other things on the menu. Have never been disappointed and will continue to eat here regularly.   Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"The best grill in the neighborhood. They cook their kabobs over a hot bed of charcoal. All the meats are prepared with delicate care.  I've tried everything on the menu except for their spaghetti. There isn't a choice you could go wrong with. My favorite is the jerked chicken plate or wrap,  They have the friendliest and very accommodating service. It's a very relaxed and inviting ambiance. Two thumbs up!  So if you haven't tried it yet, please go there. I'm a regular customer and I love going there constantly."}
{"text":"Been here a few times cause it's close to my buddies place.  It's really clean inside and the staff is very friendly.  I got the combo 8 called soltani, which had steak and ground beef kabobs (love the ground beef kabobs) it was freshly BBQd on the charcoal which gives it the best flavour in my opinion.  it came with a salad (which was fresh and they added hot peppers...i love spice it was like they knew haha).  Make sure you ask for crispy rice to mix with your rice.  I'd come back for sure as i am an avid fan of Kabobs!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is not really a 4 only because as one comment says it lack cohesion, though I felt this for a different reason that what is mentioned here before. When u order a meat dish you get rice but no veggies though you get a salad and there is no choice of veggies anywhere on the menu ! They used to have it but said noone was ordering it - that was because you had to pay another $10 to order an entire entree of veggies.  But the ppl are lovely and you can tell really into what they do.  The owner is the one who cooks and works really hard and his wife when there is amazing.  So the ambience/aura and comfort level is why I gave it a 4 and also the food is quite good - it's just a lot of meat for me that's all so the dishes are not well-balanced as they should be that's all !"}
