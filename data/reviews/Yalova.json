{"text":"I would never recommend this sh*t (and I count my words) even to my worst ennemies. When I ate there, I had food intoxication. I would remember this intoxication all my life. If I could give it a zero stars I would give it 100 times. Don't even understand how this trash restaurant is still open. 

Not to mention the staff, you feel like they hate their lives, we don't need that kind of negative energy, especially as clients! I can't find anything positive to say about this restaurant.. Please respect your stomach and don't ever go there."}
{"text":"Yalova is a very nice more-restaurant-than-café on the west side of Cote Des Neiges road, steps away from Lacombe avenue.  It can be easy to overlook, being sandwiched between McCarold's and a shawarma place, but it's worth looking out for.

The inside of the restaurant is mostly white, so it always gives the impression of being bright inside, even at midnight.  While it seems a bit small and narrow from the outside, the restaurant is very comfortable inside, and quite deep, with a lot of room for patrons.

They make great tasting grilled paninis, crêpes, and fruit smoothies, and they're open until 1 AM or later every night.  On both occasions that I visited, the staff were very friendly, and happy to answer all my questions."}
{"text":"The hot meat sandwiches are very good with white bread only (the brown bread taste low quality). Forget the fish sandwiches that are very below what you can expected (nothing special at all). Smoothies are very good. 

For the rest, I would say that the place is very dirty, toilet included. The personal is slow and not very astute, and they only stand arab repulsive music. Furthermore I find the layout very stupid. It is too bad such a potential is not well exploited."}
