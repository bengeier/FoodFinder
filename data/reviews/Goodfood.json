{"text":"I was excited to try this service but my order was a total failure. I ordered over a week in advance and planned my groceries for the week accordingly. On Sunday, I confirmed by chat on their website my order as I wanted to make sure the instructions for delivery were clear. This was confirmed. I also received an email confirmation.  However, Monday my delivery did not come as anticipated. When I contacted them I was told my order was \"lost\" which is weird since it was confirmed to me just the day prior. I was told that I could reorder for the next week - there was no option to receive my order that same week. I wouldn't order again given I don't want to risk not having meals for the week and having to scramble around at the last minute. This is supposed to make your life easier, not more complicated!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I am using this service and already have red lights going off.  I am still waiting for my first order thinking that I would receive it at a timely hour as I don't have a doorman at my building so have to be home.  Waiting from 9 am to 11 am and phoned their delivery service (after a long chat they finally gave me the delivery service number and it turns out to be Loomis coming from Montreal!) only to find out that a) they cannot even contact the driver to find out a time frame b) Loomis told me that they DO NOT TRANSPORT PERISHABLE GOODS!! (this was after I told them what was in the box) c) the food came through Montreal last night at 5 pm so that means that it has already been on the road for 16 hrs (it is now 11 am in Toronto and still no food) so definitely NOT FRESH.  I did the Chat again and told the operator what I had been told and that I would be canceling my subscription and expect a full refund.  I will be making a formal complaint through the BBB is they do not refund my money.  The company works under false pretenses and have unscrupulous business practices (i.e.:  Loomis was not aware that they are delivering perishable goods) DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY"}
{"text":"Promised food before 5 since it was coming to my office, sent me an email saying before 8pm.  Contacted them and the rep basically told me that it's implied and not to trust the email.  Waited till 5:30...nothing.  Contacted them again and the said they had zero way of tracking the delivery as they use a courier who does not provide tracking.  They sent me an email at 7:45 saying the food was there, they just dumped it outside the office.  I have cancelled it all.  Incredibly disorganized company"}
{"text":"I don't know if it's any different in Montreal, but I order from them in Toronto and it's a huge disappointment. I had three boxes so far, and each of them contained at least one pack of rotten greens, literally garbage. What they do - they wash it and then put it while it's still wet into a plastic container (for several days I guess) so, when it arrives it's half-composted (ew!) I escalated this to them the first time, but saw no improvement. I'm not going to pay for garbage!"}
{"text":"GoodFood seemed like a really promising concept and I was very excited to give it a try. I received confirmation by email that my order would be delivered on Monday before 8pm. However, 8pm passes and still no box. I reached out to their customer service and they were unable to tell me where my box was. After waiting another day, I reached out again to their customer service and they finally inform me my box was lost in transit. Unfortunately I relied on receiving the box that week and ended up having to run to the grocery store. For something that was supposed to be convenient and save time, the hassle and headache was definitely not worth it in the end. GoodFood? More like no food.."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely shocked by their customer service and poor delivery standards by Loomis. Every delivery has been just dropped off at the front vestibule of my building. This means that anyone can pick up my food parcel at any time. When I speak to customer service they say that it's Not in the agreement To deliver two apartments and they have done their job if they leave it in the foyer unattended. Absolutely shocking. They could have simply because the front office and somebody would've taken the package immediately. Save your money and pick another company. There's lots out there and their delivery is appalling."}
{"text":"Goodfood is one of those meal prep box delivery services that seem to be popping up everywhere these days.  As someone who works 8-5 every day with 2 kids, these things have been a lifesaver since going back to work after baby #2 a year ago.  You choose from about 8 different recipes on their website, and your box comes with everything you need to prepare the meal, except for really basic things like salt and pepper, olive oil.  You don't need a lot of fancy kitchen gear, and the meals are pretty straightforward,  anyone with minimal cooking experience can do it.   Have been very happy with the quality of ingredients and the choices available.  I also like how it cuts back on a lot of waste as you only have just enough of an ingredient for that meal. No more obscure spices and sauces languishing in the cupboard for years..."}
{"text":"We tried this company for the past month. It's pretty good, lots of options, and recipes are easy to do.   I like that it helps with meal planning especially if you're having mental block and have been eating the same old thing all the time.  My only negative feedback is that you have to contact an agent to cancel the subscription.   Overall, I do recommend for busy people or those who like to try out new flavors. Recipes are healthy & easy to elevate if one wishes."}
{"text":"The ingredients are fresh. It's just a gross business practice to charge for food that hasn't been ordered, because it hasn't been cancelled. They only refunded 50% of what they charged me. If you intend to only use the service occasionally, have them delete your account or you'll just find them taking money from you. Better to use some other service that doesn't use this sketchy business practice. If I hadn't checked my credit card bill, they'd be charging me weekly for food I did not order, and then that food would rot in my apartment lobby because, again, I didn't order it. I just deleted my account. Man, what a bad look.  Update: they didn't refund me any money.  Instead they dumped the box in my building lobby without even trying to buzz in. Last time my neighbour had to leave me a note saying my box (of perishable foods) was in the lobby. If they hadn't, I would have a box of rotten fish.  Glad to be finished with this business."}
{"text":"This service is great. I often found myself throwing away tons of food as I would buy vegetables and herbs but never use them. You try to mix things up, or maybe eat healthier, it seems like a good idea at the store but when you get home tired you tend to fall back on the routine meals that are quick and easy to make, ignoring the new ingredients which eventually get thrown away while you're stuck with the same old boring dinners over and over.  This service not only does away with all the waste, but it ensures we're eating something new and exciting almost every night! The recipes are truly fantastic! The other day I was comparing their recipes to those of Blue Apron (their more famous, American, counter part) as honestly I think the recipes on goodfood look much better!  I've even added a few of the things I've learned to my rotation of staples. Your package includes the perfect amount of each ingredient in individual containers so it's stupid proof and the ingredients are high quality!  I've been signed up for 3 months now and there is literally only a single time I did not enjoy the meal out of the dozens of meals I've received. I even find myself eating things I don't normally like, not a fan of fish for example but I'll take it from time to time if the preparation looks interesting. While they were not my favorites (still don't like fish) they were interesting. If you exclude the times I knowingly took an ingredient I didn't like out of curiosity, there is just that single time I was disappointed. If you can stomach it, I encourage you to go outside your comfort zone!   They've never lost or missed a delivery but I'm a little more concerned to see what happens in the summer when there is more heat and more wildlife around.  I can't say for certain whether I'm saving money compared to doing groceries but I'm certainly getting much more enjoyment out of my food! Even if I were to find out I'm paying a little more in the long run, I'd still opt to keep the service. I find myself looking forward to my delivery every week with the same anticipation you get after buying something new online.  The one negative that I would mention is that I find the listed preparation times are almost always too low. Maybe I'm just a really slow cook but it almost always takes me about double the time counting prep work. Also, be sure to read the \"you will need\" section careful as it's assumed you have staples like milk, eggs, olive oil, or salt which will not be sent. I've started making meals a couple of times before realising I was missing eggs or something like that.  I also find it weird that I can only get a maximum of 4 recipes. Sometimes all the choices look so great that I can't decide which to remove! I would gladly pay extra to get 7 meals and have one for every day. I'd also love if I could pick from the family menu (I have the classic plan) which also has some great recipes I'm sad to miss out on!"}
{"text":"Good Food - if you can get it!   In spite of the impressive publicity, internet site and social media efforts, Good Food failed at actually delivering the food that was promised. I don't know if this is just a \"Montr√©al problem\" or what, but I fail to understand how the company can send me so many updates, including a Sunday afternoon e-mail that \"Your food is on its way\" for Monday before 8pm, and then not actually deliver it! No call. No visit. Nothing. And, to make things really frustrating, Good Food closes down its customer support at 8pm! Awesome! No food and no one to talk to!   I don't know where all of these positive reviews come from, but my only experience was so frustrating that when I finally did get a hold of someone (via on-line chat, since people don't seem to answer their phones at GoodFood even the next morning after 8am), I just asked for a refund and suspended my account.   I'm disappointed that this didn't work out. In theory, it seems like a great concept. However, I do find the notion that a \"delivery company\" outsources its delivery and, therefore, has no idea what happened to an order, to be very bizarre. Delivering Food is all you do. Why would you outsource it?"}
{"text":"Have been doing this for a month with my family. Everything has well-exceeded our expectations. Every meal has been delicious. The prep time indicated seems about right. At least for an adult with a bit of cooking experience. And now my 11 year-old daughter even prepares these meals herself!"}
{"text":"Like others posting here, my issue is that the food delivery service doesn't seem to understand how to get the food delivery part down.   I don't have a buzzer so I left specific instructions for the driver to call my cell (which I provided) and then, worse case scenario, what to do if I didn't answer. The driver did none of those things; instead, s/he went into a restaurant below me asking where I was, then gave up.  I emailed customer service asking for a refund that evening and explained that the driver was actually at my location but didn't follow the delivery instructions. Instead of refunding, the customer rep told me there had been a \"delay with the driver\" [like, what? I just told you I knew what happened...], that the driver had kept everything refrigerated over night and that the food would be delivered the following day [ok, cool. driver still didn't follow instructions s/he just left it on the street by my door]. As for the \"refrigerated\" food, the freezer bags were completely thawed and warm. In the words of Yelp, \"Methinks not.\""}
{"text":"I feel bad leaving a sub-par review, especially knowing that GoodFood has really amazing service. However, I was pretty disappointed by the recipes I received and I feel like perhaps I ordered during a bad week. I was super excited about my delivery and had got a Groupon for about $31 for 4 recipes for two people (originally $39 but then 20% off during a sale). The food is packed neatly into a huge box and all food is given at once for the week. I love the recipe cards given and how all the food is labelled.   I first tried the beef medallion with mushroom sauce and sauteed vegetables. The recipe took WAY longer than the anticipated 35 min as noted on the recipe sheet. This recipe was actually really really good. The mushroom sauce however seemed unnecessary.   The second recipe I tried was the spiced lentil stew with golden cauliflower. This also took much longer than the anticipated 45 minutes. Mind you, I cook very often and I know how to cook efficiently. However, doing the preparation and cooking the cauliflower took nearly an hour. This dish was ok. I felt like the coconut milk completely over powered the entire dish and was overwhelming. The recipe said to add the entire can of coconut milk but it was way too much.  The third recipe I tried was the roasted chicken with yogurt-mustard sauce. This was just so plain tasting and felt under-whelming.  Finally, I made the pork larb lettuce cups with coconut rice. This dish also took way longer than anticipated with preparing the vegetables. This dish was just bad. The ginger, garlic and red onion completely over-powered the entire dish and I actually ended up throwing away the completed meal. It was not good.   Overall, most of the dishes took WAY longer than anticipated. These dishes do require a lot of time. I can imagine if I had a partner cooking with me, perhaps it would actually take the expected time. I also felt like some of the dishes had super random elements added to it to make it seem more complex. For example, the mushroom sauce on the beef was so unnecessary and did not add to the dish. I would have preferred more simplicity and dishes that took less time. I feel like I just ordered during a bad week though as I tried making some of the other recipes on my own without ordering from Good Food (ie the Mexican styled rice with shrimp dish) and they turned out yummy. I doubt I will order from here again though."}
{"text":"Stay away if you don't plan on having an ongoing subscription. I signed up for Goodfood because I wanted to try it occasionally, not all the time. I like coming up with my own recipes and grocery shopping to try different things but thought this was something cool to try sometimes. My first box was good, two of the three recipes were good but the last was bland and I definitely could have bought the ingredients for a fraction of the price. I skipped as many meals as I could (3 months in advance) but unfortunately for me, forgot to continue skipping. They didn't remind me even ONCE that my box was coming, nor did they let me choose what I wanted. I simply got an email the DAY BEFORE delivery that my box was on its way. SUPER shady business practice.   P.S. $65/month is NOT worth it for vegetarians or people who don't love good cuts of meat. Shopping for the ingredients in some of these vegetarian/less meaty recipes is about 1/3 of the price."}
{"text":"I'm motivated to write about Goodfood (makegoodfood.ca) because I feel the low rating is unfair.  One of my colleague has had the subscription for almost a year and has been loving it.  So when I got a coupon in the mail, I said \"heck why not!\" and signed up.  So far, I've had 5 boxes from them and 1 box from a competitor so that I can be more fair in my assessment.   Shipping. I have my box shipped to my work and have no problems with delivery.  They always deliver early afternoon in the Old Port area.  So 5/5.  Subscription model.  Yes, that's how they make money.  You have to log into your account and \"skip\" the weeks you don't want, otherwise you will be shipped a box.  I find that it's very clearly shown in your account which weeks are \"on\" or \"off\".  They also send you email reminders each week.  If you got billed (as I did), it was my fault because I simply forgot.  That being said, I was secretly happy to have a food box for the week cause their food is good! 5/5  Food and recipe quality. My criteria is that it has to be good tasting AND quick to make cause I'm slow in the kitchen. Challenge anybody? Well, I find that Good Food is up for it.  Most meals can be prepped within 30-45 min.  The best part of their recipes?  It's a complete meal: protein, veggies and starches.  I have the \"classic\" meal plan and love the unique ingredients they incorporate into the recipes.  The recipes allowed me to discover chayote salad, cherry salad, tomatillos, cotija cheese, carribean sweet potato, etc. stuff I've not normally cooked with.   It lets me live the fantasy that I know how to cook :D  They include full family and vegetarian recipes as well.  Freshness, prep time, taste, portions and presentation 4.5/5  Quality.  One thing I appreciate is the quality of the packaging/presentation.  Everything is well-packaged and attractively branded.  It shows a lot of care how well assembled the boxes are.  (Compare my experience with Miss Fresh: the meat package was slashed open and when I got the box, it was a BLOODY mess, literally.  I wasted so much time cleaning it up just so I could actually take it home. You can read more about it in my review of MissFresh.) The quality of Good Food is superior to Miss Fresh by at least 2 stars and because of that, I'm satisfied that I'm getting a fair exchange for my money. 5/5  Overall. I'm happy with Good Food.  Although I won't get a box every week, I'll keep them on and once in a while \"treat myself\" to a box.  It's like eating out but in :)  I love how diverse their recipes are, the fact that they use the basic things that anyone would have in their kitchen (zester, frying pan are your go-tos), beautiful, easy-to-follow recipe cards, reasonable pricing ($65 for 6 meals), and overall good taste.  Customer service is responsive.  Website is really user friendly.  The fact that your food is properly portioned is fantastic so there's no wasting. As a member, you have access to their menus each week so you could try making some of them on your own if you so choose or remake one that you had.  The luxury they provide is that everything you need is at your fingertips. 4.5/5  If you want to give them a try, message me and I'll send you a $40 credit!"}
{"text":"When I first joined GoodFood, it seemed interesting as the menus were different and they had vegetarian choices. However, over time the vegetarian offerings were very similar and as we go into the colder months of winter most of the vegetarian offerings were still wraps and salads were didn't appeal as comforting and warming meals.  The next problem is trying to cancel or change a meal program. Why can't these be easy to navigate and not require you to click and then go to another page to confirm?  Several times I have clicked the \"skipped\" tab and then not found the page to confirm and got the meals anyway. Expensive and annoying! No help from customer service.  Right now I am trying to figure out how to completely cancel my meals with Goodfood as one more week of meals is on its way which I was certain I cancelled. The extra money adds up and the food is often wasted or given to neighbours? Sorry, I have tried the program for 9 months and can't recommend and several people that I referred have also cancelled!"}
{"text":"I really can't find a single negative thing to say about my experience with this subscription box. I unfortunately only have the budget for the trial so I thought I'd give it a try for an easy week of meals and I loved it. I almost wish I hadn't loved it so much because It's a bit expensive otherwise, but I really do see the value.  For my trial week, I chose a steak and kale salad, a pork burger with poutine, and a pasta with shrimp and sundried tomatoes. Firstly, communication was perfect every time. I used the online live chat and every operator was really helpful and friendly. Customer service is on point. Secondly, my food arrived Monday as scheduled right to my apartment door which was great! Thirdly, all of the food was fresh and of good quality, none of the produce was bruised or broken.   So far I've cooked two of the three meals and i've really enjoyed making both of them, I'm actually looking forward to going home tonight to make the last one. The instructions and packaging are all so nice, even the box was really attractive. I'd be so happy to receive these weekly if I had the budget. The reason I do think this is worth the money for a lot of people is because cooking for two is one of those difficult things because a lot of our groceries go to waste. So often our vegetables go bad before we have time to get through them so, sadly, we waste a lot of money just throwing out groceries. With Good Food, you are giving just enough for a meal for two or four and no waste is left over, nor are you left with half a cabbage or broccoli which eventually goes to waste.  The recipes themselves are easy to follow, I do love to cook and do it often but I think a beginner cook can manage as well. The time limits are pretty accurate, however you can easily go over though if you take your time or are trying to get it to look just like the pictures on the recipe card. I also like that some of these meals can be repeated at home without the subscription.  Why not 5 stars? Well it's really the cost, I think it's a bit expensive for an average income. You really can buy so much more for $65/week at the grocery store, even though it may not be as creative and exciting, that's just my reality. I see that people keep their subscriptions for a treat once in a while and I do like that idea, I just don't want to be one of those people who forgets to skip a week and falls victim to an unwanted box. I would more than likely recommend it though and if i'm allowed to use another promo code, I would jump at the opportunity!"}
{"text":"This service is terrible. It is not serious about either reliability or customer service.  It was less than a month before I started seeing the problems with the service. Some weeks everything arrives just fine. Other times the entire weeks worth of food will simply not arrive. 24 hours later, no apology, no explanation, no refund, and no food. Only an explanation that the raw meat and chicken accompanying my box (which is still nowhere to be seen) will \"stay fresh for 48 hours\" (although this is of no value, because the box is nowhere to be seen and the company cannot locate it such that it is clear it will arrive within that timeframe).   To remedy their complete inability to provide the core and only service they offer, they offered me a 20% discount on the box I ordered. That is correct! GoodFood is insisting I pay 80% of full price for the privilege of receiving nothing. 55 dollars is a lot to pay for nothing, (Althoguh in this case it is nothing plus scrambling to find the time to go and do a week's worth of grocery shopping mid-week because the weeks worth of meals we paid for did not arrive).   AVOID. There are lots of meal services, I am going to find one that takes its customer satisfaction and reliability seriously, and if you are a busy professional hoping to find a reliable service, save your money."}
{"text":"Don't listen to the haters, must be competition trying to write bad reviews because this service is completely amazing. Always fresh food. Always interesting recipes. It helps a lot and simplifies our life as parents of 2 little boys. Every recipe comes with completely fresh ingredients and super easy to make. I fully suggest goodfood!"}
{"text":"I generally cook just for myself and I noticed that I had a lot of food wastage as I would buy fresh herbs and never get the chance to use them all up, same went for vegetables and the like. Going shopping was such a chore and I rarely had the time to do it, so I was ordering a lot of take away and not feeling so great about that. A friend of mine told me all about Goodfood and I was enthralled, so of course, I signed up right away. The box arrived all beautifully packaged and portioned; I love that you are still involved in the cooking process: chopping and dicing and the like. The recipes are simple, easy to follow and can easily be reused again and again. The ingredients are great: spices from all over, sustainable caught fish, veggies fresher than anything at Provigo, etc. I am a HUGE fan of Goodfood, it is worth every penny.  The delivery time was bang on within the window that I had asked for and the recipes are so nice and varied, there is no way that you can get tired of your selections. Trust me, this service will make your life easier."}
