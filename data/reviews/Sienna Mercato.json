{"text":"Sienna Mercato is now on my permanent rotation list for my frequent trips to Pittsburgh. It's three levels of great service and delicious food. 

I started with a craft beer and beef tartar in the beer garden. It's a cool area with a clear roof and open terrace. This would be a great place to join a group of friends, drink a little beer and watch a game on the numerous TVs.  One end is open to Penn Ave.

I then moved to the middle level where I had a good red wine and a very good bacon and clam pizza.  I like this level. I really liked the pizza. 

And, sadly, I'm too full to check out the first level. I'll save that for my next trip. 

All in all, it's now in my top 5 in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We stopped by Mezzo (the second floor) on a Saturday night. Even without a reservation (probably advised), we were seated right away. We really enjoyed our server, who really wowed us by describing and recommending a wine, and weeks later we're still raving about the pistachio and porchetta pizza."}
{"text":"I've been here twice on Friday nights, once on the 1st floor to try the meatballs, and again on the second floor for pizza, pasta, and cured meats. Both times, we had to get on a waiting list for \"45 minutes,\" when we could see that there were multiple tables open for 2. After 10 minutes or so, they call you up. They encourage you to use some app for getting in line, but I'm not sure why they give such an overestimated wait time. So, don't be discouraged if they give you a ridiculously long wait time!

The atmosphere - it's pretty loud, but you can have a conversation if you talk loudly.

The food:
1st floor - The meatballs are OK and reasonably priced. I got the spicy pork meatball slider and the beef meatball slider. Both meatballs were a bit dry. I liked the flavors in the spicy pork meatball - the beef meatball was a bit average, nothing special. I'm a bit curious to try their doughnuts, otherwise I won't be coming back here.

2nd floor - They use a lot of salt here. I tried a pizza, pasta, and the cured meats. I wasn't impressed by the cured meats, but the pasta and pizza were great. I wish they weren't so salty, but I would definitely go back to try more of their pasta and pizzas. TIP: the half pasta dishes are actually pretty substantial! I'd definitely get the half pasta for just myself. For two people, a pizza should be satiating enough, but you'd be full sharing a half pasta and a pizza. I'd love to go back with a group of 3-4 girls and to try a bunch of the half pastas together."}
{"text":"Food is good. Bar service is bad. Bartender took my glass when I wasn't looking and didn't offer to get another drink (I only had one.). Had to flag her down. Too busy flirting with other bartender. 7 people at bar."}
{"text":"For the price the pizza it was not worth it!  The atmosphere is cool but the food is just not anything to get excited about!"}
{"text":"Poutine! 

The first floor is Emporio, a Meatball joint. I thought the same thing. I went with my judgement in hand and I left with a belly full of Poutine. My friend and I shared this the first time - we now always get our own. 
 
$7 gets you a heafty portion of poutine - You can choose between fries and tater tots - you do what you want, but the tots are the only way to go in my mind. Served with a hearty mound of melted cheese curds and slathered in hot, delicious gravy. (Thanks, Canada!)  I've gotten it with and without a meatball, with and without an egg (ask for it dippy!) and with and without pancetta (they also have bacon). My favorite way is tots and mushroom gravy, no add-ons.  And I'm normally a fan of add-ons. The chicken gravy is good too, but just a tad oily/fatty tasting. The pancetta is made in-house and, in my opinion, it's FAR too salty.

The easy, relaxed atmosphere has a trendy enough vibe to support it's focus on ye ol' meatballs and yet not so trendy that you raise a fist in the air and curse Portland. The servers are all nice and very helpful. The service is FAST!

Emporio has a great selection of beer - my favorite is Lagunitas Cappuccino Porter. Additionally, they have loveable little water glasses at the tables made of recycled water bottles and they leave a large glass bottle of water at the start of service. It's a simple but nice touch."}
{"text":"I was only here for a short time for drinks in the bar and then on the rooftop, but I really enjoyed their draft selection and the rooftop atmosphere. It's a great spot to take advantage of the spring/summer weather. I'll have to come back to try the food. I've heard that the \"mezze\" (I think that's what they call the middle floor) is also good. I'll have to get back and try the food."}
{"text":"Birthdays  have always been a week-long celebration in my life. Yes, that means I am blessed (and appreciate it) and get to eat lots of good food while catching  up with loved ones. 

Sienna Mercato is located Downtown Pittsburgh slightly north of the Cultural District. My aunt and I enjoyed beer (my last for 31 days) and each ordered a la carte meatballs (2 pesto, 2 marinara) and also enjoyed the Poutine (potatoes with cheese). Though all tasty, this experience felt more like a quick business lunch more than a celebratory birthday dinner. We were seated at a wobbly table in the center of the restaurant when many more intimate options were available. I'm not being passive-aggressive, just honest about the \"experience.\" The highlight was a shared order of pecan balls that were sooooo delicious (a bit frozen, so obviously pre made). 

In the end, I would never go here for a date or dinner, but definitely on the run in a tight timeframe while conducting business Monday-Friday. It would also be a great start prior to a sports game or concert. 

Attendees beware: the beer garden on the top floor (complete with a revolving glass roof) is only open Wednesday-Saturday. I'm sure that will change as the demand increases. Just FYI. Thanks to Aunt Joan for a lovely night on the town to celebrate Matthew's Eve!"}
{"text":"I tried the vegetarian balls and I haven't been able to stop thinking about them since. Loved it."}
{"text":"Emporio is an absolute great place to enjoy lunch while downtown or in Wexford! Great food, quick service and management that cares. Troy, who we've seen managing at both locations, gets it and will go above and beyond to make sure you enjoy your dining experience. Top notch, and that goes a long way!"}
{"text":"Mezzo: This \"Middle\" Floor Eatery Tops My Downtown Restaurant List

My voice is starting to strain from singing the praises of Matthew Porco!  This 2010 Chef of the Year is ensuring that Mezzo, the newly opened second floor eatery of Sienna Mercato, is sending delectable food to your table without the usual new-opening indigestion.  And he's not just leading his culinary team behind those swinging kitchen doors either.  He's the bearded fellow who has been manning the wood-fired pizza/prep station since opening day.  If you're lucky enough to sit at the bar, you can watch him perform the dance of the pizzas while he rotates gourmet pies among the flames, as this seating area has no obstructed viewing. 

Although my favorite seat in practically any eatery I patron is that of a barstool, I want to give Mezzo's dining area some much-deserved love, too. The sleek table settings and hardwood floors are softly illuminated with cascading Edison bulbs.  And Sienna's staple of open-air dining is maintained with retractable garage-style windows that let you take in the views on Penn Avenue when the weather cooperates.  What I'm trying to say here is that Mezzo is stylish...romantic...teetering on sexy even.

The only thing more appealing than how Mezzo looks, is what you get to put in your mouth while you ogle the place.  Yes, the pizza is downright superb as I alluded to earlier.  Chef Porco has taken the idea of gourmet pizzas to an even higher level.  We have had the pleasure of trying a few pies.  The Picante Salami and Peppers had a hearty, robust tomato sauce that was kicked up a notch with the addition of chili flakes and banana peppers.  The one that I will be comparing all other pies to from now until further notice, however, is the Pistachio and Porchetta.  I literally just stopped writing because I was trying to relive the consumption of that pie in my mind.  In place of tomato sauce, a foundation of pistachio pesto was generously applied and then blanketed with tender slices of porchetta (pork roast) dusted with fennel pollen.  This would be a party in your mouth as it is, but then they top the piping hot mozzarella with fresh arugula dressed in a citrus-based vinaigrette.  There are no words left to say...just go get one.  Okay, enough pizza chitchat...on to to other eats.

So when combining everything we've ordered in our visits since Mezzo's very recent opening, I've had the privilege of trying maybe ten different menu items.  (Jeeealous!)  Literally, everything I've tried has been pleasing to the eyes and palate.  Starting with drinks, my Manhattans have been expertly crafted.  You may also want to try some vino from their growing wine list.  You really can't go wrong either way.  While you imbibe, you need to order up some appetizers.  I equally loved the Grilled Octopus and the Greens and Beans.  The medley of al dente white beans and roasted red peppers made the octopus dish light, yet filling enough to appease my growing hunger pangs.  The greens and beans were savory to say the least.  Rich, somewhat briny broth played perfectly with the spiciness of the crumbled sausage that enriched every bite. 

Some other pre-entr√©e items worth ordering are the Little Gems salad and the charcuterie board.  A basic Caesar salad was elevated to gourmet status by using imported anchovies to not only create a flavor-punching vinaigrette but to also adorn the baby romaine hearts.  If you've written off anchovies because you recall them being dark, bony, morsels of dankness, give them another go.  These lil' guys are the real deal and will change your outlook on life...or maybe just your opinion of tiny fish.  The chef selected charcuterie board on the other hand...

{"text":"Great poutine, draft selection and meatballs!  A little pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Cool spot! Not a carnivore, so I skipped the first floor (which serves meatballs) & headed up to the second for pizza. The whole menu looked good & I liked that you had the option of ordering half portions of the pastas/risottos. The pizza options were creative & I settled on the Tartufo. Wasn't exactly what I envisioned based on the description, but it was yummy nonetheless.

Was bummed that they didn't offer any draught beer options, even though they have plenty downstairs...don't think it would be that tough for servers to run down to grab a pint, but they may beg to differ. Pizza & beer go well together, so it would've been nice to have more of a selection than the few bottles & cans on offer (although I'll admit the small selection was diverse).

Service was so-so. It wasn't very busy, yet our beers took a surprising amount of time to arrive. Our server repeatedly forgot to bring things we'd requested...red pepper flakes, extra napkins, a glass of water, another round of beer. The hostess also kept seating people right on top of us despite the fact that the restaurant was pretty empty. Not sure why we needed to be surrounded by people on all sides while the rest of the place was wide open.

Definitely want to check out the rooftop next time!"}
{"text":"I called to inquire about Valet Parking and was told that they most certainly offered Valet parking services.  Needless to say they do not.  I was told by the hotel across the street that they tell people that all the time so it won't keep people from coming.  Also, the food is average."}
{"text":"1st floor tastes the best, second floor is just okay and I do't drink so no opinion about the beer garden other than it looks really cool"}
{"text":"I have been able to visit each floor and overall I'm pleased! 

I truly am not a fan of meatballs, but the spicy pork ones were fantastic. I had an heirloom tomato salad at mezzo which was surprisingly filling and the rooftop bar is fun to visit. 

I would really like to go back and try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Meatballs were OK. Service for dinner OK. Bartender on the roof beer garden awful. Rude. Rude. Rude. Won't go back."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and haven't been disappointed in the food once. The meatballs are always fresh, tender, and juicy. Their pork bolognese has a hint of sweet spice to it, so heads up of you prefer a more acidic red sauce.  Their mushroom gravy has a hint of nostalgia for grandma's beef stroganoff and the buffalo balls are can't miss. 
It does not get more stars due to the shoddy service by their serving staff. The best service we have gotten was seated at the bar. Each time we have table service, orders are wrong, drinks are never refilled or are forgotten about. During one trip, the server took my boyfriend's food and drink order first (big no-no, ladies first!) and then walked away from the table!  She never even got mine. She returned later with my boyfriend's beer, and we had to informer that she never took my order. Needless to say, my boyfriend's food showed up 15 minutes before mine. If they fix their serving staff, it could easily be one of the best casual dining experiences in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great beer, and great happy hour beer (all drafts 1/2 off). Bartenders are friendly and knowledgable, and you can't go wrong with any appetizer or meatball choice."}
{"text":"I have been here about half a dozen times.  I like to bring out-of-towners here.  The rooftop bar is great and has a lovely view of the city.  The meatballs are a fun concept.  One of my go-to restaurants."}
{"text":"Food was good. Experience was miserable. We had friends in town from Canada. They brought their drivers license. The bar told them they needed passports. They spend money on an uber back and forth. We proceed to have dinner. Not bad. Service was good. But since we were unable to experience rooftop bar prior to dinner we wanted to check it out after. We asked since we just had dinner could we go up to the rooftop. We were told we could but we needed to wait in the 25 minute line. Just an unfortunate situation and management really doesn't care. Completely useless. Just a standard manager without any form of professional management background. Unfortunate. May go back. We can spend money in a variety of ways that care to cater to those that go out of their way to spend money at their establishment."}
{"text":"Meatballs! I never thought I'd like government cheese so much. At the time we were there, I would have given 3 stars. It was crowded, the staff was a bit edgy, and I can't get overly excited over meatballs. However, I had a meatball someplace else recently and found myself craving Sienna Mercato. I need to go back.

Other Cons: I wish they had a spicier option. Poo-tine's great until the next day."}
{"text":"Incredible margarita pizza. The best pie I've ever had. Great atmosphere. The 3rd floor beer garden is a must at night time."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and this time was subpar, perhaps due to being busier than normal around the holiday.   I had a pork tomato basil panini.  It was fine, the sauce was good but the meatballs themselves didn't have much flavor.  The brussel sprouts were way over cooked and salted; these have been better previously.   We had the pepperoni fritters and they also seemed slightly overdone, they were small and seasoning exterior was too overdone and it overpowered everything else.   Ambiance is great here, no wait app was 20 minutes off.   Have had some good dishes here and risotto and poutain have been good"}
{"text":"Meh. Supposedly \"trendy\" place.  Long wait on a Friday evening, but that is to be expected. The food certainly wasn't great. Not bad, but certainly not all that good. Our waitress clearly didn't want to be there. And I'm sure there are plenty of friendly and hardworking waiters and waitresses there, so I certainly don't mean to group them all together in one blanket statement. But I'm pretty sure our waitress hated us.

If it's on the menu, get the corned beef ball. Avoid the risotto, the chicken ball and the government cheese mac n cheese."}
{"text":"I came here and ate on the first level, Emporio. The meatballs were truly delicious. There are so many ways to enjoy them, too! I came around 8pm and the bar was full and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. This is definitely a great date night spot!"}
{"text":"Fun place. Love that they have 3 levels completely differs from each other. Level 3 is amazing when it is summer. Their appetizers are v good too. Drinks are strictly okay. They could make better cocktails."}
{"text":"I sat at the 1st floor bar, ordered a drink from the cocktail menu and was ignored till after my drink was empty. The 1st bartender was too busy entertaining the preppy couple and the pack of young business guys nursing their drinks. Because of this, I planned to pay for my drink and find another place for dinner. Thankfully, a second bartender noticed my empty drink and came to my aid. Then the first bartender perked up and realized I was willing to spend some money. Anyway...

The beef meatballs were hohum but the marinara sauce was classic and great.
My mixed drink was simple and tasty
The bar stools are horribly uncomfortable 
And at least 1 bartender needs to learn that some women travel for business, eat alone and tip well if you keep my drink full"}
{"text":"Went to lunch on the first floor because I heard so much about their meatballs. They were below their hype level, but still delicious! They had a variety of ways you could have them made and how they would serve it to you. Their sauce was definitely up to par. The meatballs were well seasoned and complemented well with the sauce. I also ordered their side of mac n cheese. I gotta say its up there on the top 3 for me of places to get Mac N Cheese from."}
{"text":"Nothing great. Would not go back. Meat balls were just okay. Nothing else on menu to choose from."}
{"text":"Went to Mezzo and was not disappointed. Started with the charcuterie and cheese platter and everything was fantastic. Followed that up with the breakfast pizza and it was incredible. Such an odd/wonderful combination of flavors at the place that will keep me coming back for more.

Also want to check out the rooftop bar sometime soon!"}
{"text":"amazing place! great atmosphere.
the bad thing it's you need a reservation which we didin't know. 
the food is really good"}
{"text":"I've love this place since moving to Pittsburgh 2 years ago. I've recommend it to guests from out of town and random people on the street. However, something has changed and the quality has gone down in the last 2-3 months. During my last visit the meatballs seemed bigger, but the flavor wasn't better. The sauce that I usually order was the fresh tasting pesto. Now they have changed It to some sort of warm, cheesy mess. Their beer selection is still good, so if you are hitting them up for happy hour then you'll still be happy."}
{"text":"Good ambiance. Enjoyed the concept. Service was lackluster at the bar downstairs at best. It wasn't even that busy! I ordered a salad and a meatball trio. Food was average at best. Presentation good. Terrible that you can not order a meatball smaller without ordering multiple items as each order can not mix and match. They should be more flexible so one can sample with the thought that finding something you like, might bring you back. However, not a place I'll be rushing back for."}
{"text":"Always one of my favorite places to go when I'm down town. I stumbled in last year after leaving comic-con, and the staff was very accepting and friendly of everyone who came by (cosplayers included). The restaurant has a very laid back and trendy vibe, making it a perfect place to stop in with your family or a few friends at any time. The most interesting part of going is that their restaurant is broken into three tiers; Emporio (a meatball joint), Mezzo (for wine & pizza), and Il Tetto (a rooftop beer garden and cocktail bar).

Coming from a large Italian family, I'm always skeptical of getting meatballs whenever I go out. That being said, Emporio's meatball and sauce selection felt like a homage to many of the traditional recipes I grew up on.They have a choice of 4 different types of meatballs and 10 different sauces (including vegetarian and gluten free options for both categories). I always order the \"saucy balls\" which comes with 4 (fairly large) meatballs with a choice of sauce. They also have a fantastic poutine, which I would highly recommend. 

I have not been able to visit Mezzo yet, but I have been to Il Tetto several times. The beer selection is impressive, boasting 32 drafts that get rotated periodically. The cocktail list is not huge, but I have found that they can make pretty much any classic that you ask of them. The cocktails always seem to be slightly heavy handed, but nothing unbearable. You can also order bar snacks, pizza, and desserts if you want something to eat or snack on while you hang out.

Overall, I would would highly recommend stopping in if you need somewhere fun and relaxed to stop for lunch and dinner. It's also a great place to take people visiting from out of town, as it is not to fancy and have a good selection for all tastes. The only gripe I have is that it is pricier than I would have thought."}
{"text":"I love the concept of the restaurant and the food and atmosphere. There are three levels, with the top level having a huge rooftop experience with retracting roof, so you can enjoy a view of the unique architecture of the local skyline. 

I ate on the second floor and had a fantastic pork chop. Their glaze was delicious and the chop itself was delicious and tender. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Started from the top and worked our way down, loved the cocktails, good beer selection. We had beef tartar, very tasty. On the second floor we chose the charcuterie and cheese board, the beef pasta and the pork and pistachio pizza, all very good. We loved the option of a three ounce pour of wine, gave us the chance to pick multiple wines throughout dinner. The chocolate dessert was one of my favorites in pittsburgh, major kudos to the pasty chef on flavor and presentation. Our waitress was attentive, the atmosphere was nice also. Didn't make it to the meatball floor, it was buzzing with what seemed to be a more family oriented crowd. All and all, we had a wonderful date night, thanks y'all!"}
{"text":"Fun place with lively atmosphere. There are different dining options. We opted for the meatball menu downstairs and it was delicious. Great selection of craft beers too. Only thing that held me back from 5 stars were portions that were on the small side. We did not leave hungry - we were just expecting larger servings. Quality of food certainly did not disappoint and staff was very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Maybe I shouldn't write a review until I've been to all 3 (?) floors of Sienna Mercato, but - I recently ate at the first floor of this place, which specializes in meatballs. I don't really get the appeal, I suppose.

The place was very crowded and loud. The food is mediocre. (I could direct you to plenty of divey Pittsburgh bars with better food), and the service is just...okay.

I tried a couple versions of their meatballs as well as I believe their fried pickles. Everything is greasy, tasteless, and pretty much boring. Perhaps their other floors are better, but I would not recommend the \"meatball floor.\" Good beer selection and probably ok for a quick bite during happy hour time, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Neat place. The menu looks simple, but there are a lot of combinations to try.  But you'd better like meat balls.   Everything we had was excellent and our server was attentive and friendly.    

If you want to try a variety, get multiple sliders with different combinations of sauces and meats."}
{"text":"Amaze (meat)balls. Best veggie meatballs I've ever had. Excellent poutine. Friendly staff, great vibe. Looking forward to their other locations."}
{"text":"A group of five family and friends decided to grab a bite to eat at 5:45 on a Saturday night, before we saw Cabaret at the Benedum. First time for three of us, the other two had been here before. We were pleasantly surprised to be seated at Emporio immediately upon entering. The wait staff quickly served us water, asked us for our drinks and we had all five on the table within 5-7 minutes of being seated. Outstanding.
The group ordered a variety of foods, including tomato risotto, salads, mac and cheese, the anniversary saucy balls in marina over penne and spaghetti and a meatball sandwich. Drinks ranged from drafts to wine to rum and coke. All were refilled quickly and without being pushed on us. We shared the donuts in chocolate dipping sauce for dessert. 
The feel is casual, the tables, while being close together don't make you feel like you are sitting with the people next to you. It is not overly noisy but has enough ambient sounds so that your conversation isn't the center of attention for three nearby tables. TV sets were on ESPN or RootSports to view the Penguins. Another thumbs up for the sports fans in our group.
Wonderful experience, great good/solid food for a nice price. And we were easily done with our meals and drinks and dessert in time for the 8:00 show. That in itself was worth the good review. Many times we try to grab a bite to eat before a show and end up having to cut the meal or drinks short in order to make the show. Not so at Emporio. Well done."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in town I go here I've eaten here 4 times now and it's always been good I love their pesto sauce the risotto is excellent and you can't go wrong with their meatballs save a large list of craft beers. three different floors three different restaurants I've only eaten on the first floor which is a meatball bar restaurant next time I'm back in town I will be back here again good restaurant go and enjoy"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Wonderful service! We loved our night out in Pittsburgh because of this restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Restaurant is good, food is good.  Don't bother with the rooftop on a nice day.  Can't even get close to the bar for a drink.  Can't believe they are allowed to have that many people up there without breaking the fire code."}
{"text":"I find the marinara (tomato-based) sauce they offer in their downstairs concept to be too tangy/acidic. I also think they are a bit too heavy-handed with garlic in their macaroni and cheese. Overall, I found their service level to be pretty good besides the gentleman that runs the door up in their open rooftop bar. The very first time I went up there to meet a bunch of work colleagues, I took the elevator and walked into the rooftop area. I had no clear indication or sign that I was suppose to wait right there before making my way inside. I immediately spotted my colleagues, and started walking toward them. However, I was suddenly jerked back by the door gentleman as he grabbed the back of my sweater collar and yanked me back to him and informed me that I should've waited for him to check my ID, etc. What the..?? At the time, I brushed this off but in hindsight it upset me pretty bad. I should have reported this incident to his manager at the time, but I honestly did not see any indications that I had to have my ID checked once the elevator doors opened (nor was this gentleman making any sort of immediate physical request for my ID). However, it seems that he thought it was appropriate to deliver a horse-collar on me in front of all the patrons and my work colleagues who I was walking towards. I haven't been back since, but I hope this gentleman hasn't continued this sort of unprofessional behavior because everyone else that works there seem to be extremely professional. And in case you are wondering -- no, I wasn't drunk, or copping an attitude, or leaving anything out. Like I said, it was my first time going up to their rooftop, the elevator doors opened, I spotted my friends, started walking their way, and then YANK."}
{"text":"Kinda average. The best italian is Il Piazziolo."}
{"text":"Place is delicious and a must stop for meatball lovers. Well worth the wait. Beer list is solid and we will be back."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! The food here was fantastic! We had a bruschetta, a pizza, pork risotto and some local beers. (On the second floor) points deducted for lack of soap in the bathrooms (eeew!) and inflexibility with menu items. I understand there are limitations with ingredients but bacon shouldn't be one of them when it's included in multiple menu items."}
{"text":"We went to Emporio Meatball Joint on the first floor for lunch and left very full and very happy. We had meatballs in panini and slider formats. We enjoyed being able to pick our own sauces but the meatballs were delicious on their own. The draft beer selection was really impressive also. If we're ever in Pitt again, we will come back."}
{"text":"Lindsey at the 3rd floor bar isn't very nice. I asked for 4 different shots which I know can be a pain but the entire time she complained to her co-workers about having to make 4 shots. It was my mother's birthday and I wanted to get the family what they wanted. Seemed to be an inconvenience for her, but considering the bar wasn't that busy, I thought it would be okay. Sorry for ruining your night Lindsey!"}
{"text":"Every few years my family makes a short trip to Pittsburgh and looks for a nice place to grab dinner. We found Sienna Mercato on Yelp, walked in off the street and were happy to find they had room for us.  We were impressed by the excellent, knowledgeable service and delicious food, especially all of the Italian specialty dishes. They also had an impressive selection of drinks and created a wonderful, enjoyable atmosphere where it was still quiet enough to hear one another speaking."}
{"text":"I was not so impressed by this restaurant. There were two gripes in particular. First, even though some of the options come with multiple meatballs in the order, they will not let you mix and match which I can't understand. Second, all the sides are huge and cost over five dollars each which is more expensive than a side for one person should be. There should be a small and a large unless you're just trying to charge people more than you should.

They do have an awesome beer list and my server was very nice, however."}
{"text":"This places is not bad but not great. I know everyone loves this place and I am one of the few people to only give it 3 stars. Maybe I'm just picky, but I think it is overrated. The beer selection is great and the atmosphere is very cool. However, the food itself is not anything too amazing. And that's generally the main focus of a restaurant - the food. They did a good job on everything else except the food itself.... The meatball thing is a cool idea, but most of the meatball dishes that I had weren't that wonderful. The rooftop bar is awesome and really cool vibe day or night. But the meatballs are a little overrated. Overall this place is good, not great."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem!! I love unique restaurants and this is the perfect little spot to hang out. Me and my date got meatballs on the first floor (VERY reasonably priced with big portions) and went up to the third floor for some drinks. It was a beautiful atmosphere upstairs and we had a wonderful view of the city. My grandmom makes the best meatballs in the world, so it's hard to compare the beef meatballs, so I would definitely suggest the turkey flavor in a panini! Very very good!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Rooftop Bar Garden has an awesome view. Perfect place to take a party from out of town."}
{"text":"Have only checked out the first floor.  The meatballs are good, not great.  Enjoyed the unique menu and the opportunity to mix and match different types of meatballs and sauces.  Prices were average, not over priced by any means."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Pittsburgh, especially in the summer. Honestly the drinks are good (not great) and it can be somewhat miserable trying not to get to the roof because the elevator moves so slowly and there is often a long line, but the roof is just so awesome. It's a big area and very beautiful. Best bar atmosphere in Pittsburgh! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I like to get a salad with some meatbals and fries.  It's a simple restaurant with some great tasting meatballs, great salads, and good fries.  Nice atmosphere too."}
{"text":"The meatball lunch menu was different, and very delicious. Friendly service and great patio"}
{"text":"Good food. Good people. Good drinks. Good balls. 

Absolutely love this place.

They have plenty of options and large courses. If parking wasn't such a bear downtown I'd go here a whole lot more.

Surprisingly: meatballs can be heated up the next day. 

Government cheese. Try it."}
{"text":"This place is over rated. I ate dinner on the Mezzo level and ordered the arugula salad and margarita pizza. The food was pretty bland in my opinion. The atmosphere is nice and place is super trendy so I think that's what attracts most.  I don't think the food was good enough for a return visit."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh for business, and someone recommended Sienna Mercato. They compared their meatballs better than The Meatball Shop in NYC. I stand by my raving reviews of The Meatball Shop so I had to try it out and compare. I had two sliders- Classic Beef with marinara sauce and Vegetarian (mushroom, white bean, cauliflower) with spinach almond pesto. 

Overall, the meatball sliders were ok. They were all about quantity than quality. Meatball was pretty big, but the taste was underwhelming. I'd go there again to try out their other items like the cured meats and pasta. They also have a beer garden on the rooftop. But I don't think I'd go get their meatballs again."}
{"text":"Great roof bar!  We didn't eat there and the wait for drinks was a bit crazy, but the roof bar is a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"This is a super amazing place. I only got the meatballs , but you can pick what meatballs and what sauce you want. They are so big and tasty. The sauces we had we are also very delicious. people should check it out if they love meatballs!"}
{"text":"The vegetarian meatballs is a unique twist to he menu and rates good with quinoa. The food is good but the service is ok"}
{"text":"I ate at the meatball place. I love a good meatball place because its pretty cheap and you can be imaginative for the combinations you make. And this place meats (typo intentional) the bill. Good friendly service, water in little mason jars, and the ability to try different types of meatballs. Also good apps and side items available. 

Would definitely eat here again, especially since the price/value is so good."}
{"text":"Started off at Mezzo for the Italian Cheese board and a charcuterie with a bottle of wine and everything was fantastic. My date and I also had a pizza that was phenomenal. My only grip with Mezzo was that the cocktail menu seemed a bit strange for the atmosphere. I was expecting Italian appertif based items when it seemed like an odd mix of whiskey and tequila instead. That being said the drink that I chose was fantastically crafted and delicious. After dinner we went to Il Tetto to catch a bit of the Pens game and while we only stayed for one beer it was at no fault of the restaurant. The weather was perfect and the rooftop is probably one of the better atmospheres to have a beer at in Pittsburgh when the weather is good. Great selection of beer and the service at this entire place is spectacular. One of our staple downtown experiences."}
{"text":"First time here and although the ambiance was very good the service and food was mediocre. We waited at least 15 minutes before a bartender would take our order.  It seems that the people who were seated had priority. Each bartender was working the whole bar instead of an area of the very long bar. 
The food was ok but the vegetarian meatballs were not fully cooked and the mushroom gravy was pasty and thick. Not what was expected. Pork meatballs were good. Service was better downstairs."}
{"text":"Check out the rooftop bar, especially on Sunday nights! They decorate the bar area with coconut candles and palm trees around the light fixtures and they have a TIKI themed menu! We ate coconut shrimp skewers and a Hawaiian pizza and drank cocktails from tiki glassware! So fun!"}
{"text":"This is a review for Emporio, the meatball joint on the first floor.  I have yet to try Mezzo, the Italian restaurant on the 2nd floor or their beer garden on the roof, but I do plan to.
I've been to Emporio twice, and have thoroughly enjoyed the food, atmosphere, and menu.  Among other items (your apps, salads, sides) you pick your meatball, your sauce/gravy, and how you want it served. 
The beer selection is good too!
I'm not a big meatball person, but if you've ever enjoyed a meatball, Emporio is certainly worth visiting!"}
{"text":"Best meatballs I've ever had. The bartender helped me through the ordering process and gave me his advice! Excellent choice!
Meatball of the month had bacon and cheese in it, cover that with govt cheese and a pickle! Unreal"}
{"text":"Now that I have succeeded in visiting each floor separatetly, I feel authorized to review this awesome place.  With each floor having their own personality and menu, it's easy to see why this place is attractive to diners and night-lifers alike.  Let's start with the first floor--Emporio--known as the meatball joint.  The atmosphere was quaintly industrial and felt comfortable and inviting.  We love to sit at bars so that's what we did.  The bartenders were friendly and helpful as I navigated their gin offerings.  They shook a good martini---win!  The meatballs we tasted were flavorful and portioned well. Coming from a family of amazing meatball-makers and being a pretty good meatball maker myself, this is a good review!   The 2nd floor was also inviting but felt a little more \"restauranty\" to us---which is not a bad thing (but it's the best way I could describe it).  We decided on the Margherita pizza and the butcher's board and a lovely red wine (recommended by our wait person).  Although we could have made more adventuresome picks, we really enjoyed the simplicity and freshness of the meal.  Floor 3-- Il Tetto--was actually my personal favorite spot.  It's fun and eclectic and highlights the city in a different way than many other night spots and restaurants. We try to have drinks there when we can (it can get really really crowded so you have to choose the timing very carefully).  The bartenders are more casual than Emporio but nontheless good with the martini shaker.  
Sienna Mercato is an excellent venue that's positioned well in the city.  It's a feel good place.....which is always a good thing!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night and it being Sunday and me being from an Italian family, I opted for classic beef meatballs in marinara over spaghetti. The meatballs were pretty good as far as non-homemade meatballs go. The marinara was okay--pretty  average. 

For an appetizer, we got the pepperoni something--I forget what they were called--but they were basically Italian hush puppies."}
{"text":"The upstairs bartender was a complete douche. The food and server downstairs were markedly better.  Absolutely worth trying, but I heartily recommend avoiding the \"I'm too cool to serve you\" types upstairs.  They forget their place."}
{"text":"great crowd but food is not good. tried on two different time would only go back to drink"}
{"text":"Great service!  Our waitress was cheerful and accommodating.  The balls were also unexpectedly de'lish!  (Turkey was moist and veggie was vegan).  Stay away from \"government cheese\" (duh on my part) as it's like velveeta.  Nice spot."}
{"text":"We went to Mezzo (second floor), and ordered two different pasta dishes. One with lamb, the other one vegetarian (cannot remember exactly what vegetables were included). My husband and I both felt the pastas were undercooked, way below getting to the al dente stopping point. Too crunchy. Maybe it was an off-night. Perhaps will return to try the pizza or the Emporio."}
{"text":"I dreamed of meatballs last night after dinner here.  We didn't get to see the second floor, but had some drinks on the awesome roof top bar, then dinner down below.  This is a MUST in Pittsburgh.  The roof top bar has a great selection on tap with some ciders as well (good gluten free option).  The view is amazing.  It's a glass top, so closed when cold, open when warmer.  After drinks we headed down to Emporio for dinner.  The menu is not something I've seen before.  Some intriguing app, but we didn't indulge. The gist of the menu is MEATBALLS.  Four types, meat, veggie, pork, or turkey (which is the only gluten free option, but well worth it).  Then picking a sauce, and style. (Saucy balls are a must).  Sides are available.  I had my turkey meatballs with arrabbiata sauce over gluten free penne.  I also asked for a side of the tzatziki sauce, because it's one of my favs (worth it). My wife had the veggie balls with a mushroom gravy over tater tots, yes tater tots. Don't make that face, they were great she said.  The atmosphere is very inviting, staff/service at both spots were on point.  Cannot wait to return.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have frequented Sienna Mercato/Emporio (meatballs) many times in the past, with good results and left happy enough. I've never really liked the prices they put on the food and I hate that there's no happy hour specials on the rooftop but there is on the first floor (what?). But regardless, the food is tasty and the idea behind the restaurant grouping is unique.

Anyway, went to lunch here with co-workers about a week and a half ago and left unhappy.
First thing I noticed on arrival, across the board raise on prices. I get it, you need to occasionally raise prices if business is slowing or what not, but dang, they raised the prices. And I'm sorry but one meatball should not cost $3.50 in my personal opinion. 

Second, I always order two meatballs on top of the tomato risotto. The risotto is always good, and I like the meatballs. But service here is sooo picky. I order a pork and beef meatball, and ask for it on top of risotto. Shouldn't be a problem, right? The meatballs come in individual metal serving bowls (annoying in their own right) and the risotto also separately. I question why they're not on top of the risotto in one of the big bowls (as I usually have had in the past), and he explains you have to get the same balls to get that. Okay fine, I remember I've order the same balls in the past and have gotten what I wanted, but where was the warning about that as I ordered my food and asked for the food as I wanted? So this is sounding really winy, I know. But then, I asked him to simply take the risotto, pour it into a big bowl, and throw the meatballs on top in one bigger bowl. He takes the food, comes back 3 minutes later, \"we can't do that\", and offers to bring me my own bowl to do it myself. Really? I decline, eat my food, and leave.

I've had questionable experiences with meatballs in the past, but I'm done with this place. I cannot handle cruddy service and ridiculous serving policies because the place wants to be \"fancy\" and \"hip\". And prices? $12+ for two meatballs a small bowl of risotto. Nope."}
{"text":"I arrived starving and ordered half the menu and a few different mixed drinks. The menu is simple and focused, and they do it very well. Server, Vince, gave great recommendations, was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Out of ribs- won't get me wings - won't get meatballs from downstairs- don't come here - they can't help you....."}
{"text":"I was so glad I chose to have lunch here because the menu offered a variety of foods with a emphases on the meatball creations and it was so delicious. I had the turkey meatballs with Parmesan and it was absolutely amazing. It was a perfect combination of sauces and not being overlooked upon. I also had the pleasure of having their donut balls for desert and they were to die for! Another fantastic eat on Penn Ave in Pittsburgh. The prices on the menu during lunch were so affordable and I can't wait to return! The wait staff was friendly and always at your side when you needed something or had a menu question. So helpful!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Have had such a fun experience each time I go! The balls are all amazing!"}
{"text":"Wandered in here alone because it was across from the hotel, open on Sunday, and I was looking for World Cup and a beer. I don't like eating alone when traveling, but Lindsey behind the bar was super friendly and made me feel at home. I was disappointed to find out the menu consists of mostly just soup, salad, and meatballs, but that was a rash judgment! 

Maybe 30 taps had local and far away beers, with perhaps half of them IPAs, which is OK by me. I settled on a local brew, the Fatheads Head Hunter IPA, 7.5%, $7.50, which was pretty darn good.

I had the meatball grinder with Grandmas traditional beef balls, Sunday sauce (marinara) and provolone, and it may have been the best meatball sub I've ever had. Bread was hot, crusty and substantial, and stood up to the marinara. Balls were huge, racket ball size, and I found I was better off cutting them in half and rearranging on the bun.

Great place, and I will definitely be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Courtyard across the street and stopped in for lunch.  Food came out quick and was very good!  Definitely recommended to others visiting in the area."}
{"text":"The place is more of a sports bar. Good atmosphere but not sure if I liked the food: everything was too salty and over all nothing special."}
{"text":"The rooftop bar is great for drinks but I wouldn't say it's worth the wait if busy. Their menu is limited and if you ate vegetarian, there is not nearly anything to sample from. Drinks ok. Meh."}
{"text":"Started with the pepperoni fritters because, what the hell is that? Basically the best appetizer ever. The main course was just as good. Reasonably priced, interesting layout, and service was prompt. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great food, service and fun atmosphere.  Chef's board for charcuturie and cheese always a good starter option.  Pizzas are delightful."}
{"text":"Love this place. A go to when I'm in town because of the great food and generally friendly faces!"}
{"text":"This place epitomizes the rumored transformation that is in the process of taking place in Pittsburgh. Great food, drinks, and service, but the atmosphere is second to none. Definitely a must visit for locals and visitors alike! You will not feel like you're in \"Pittsburgh\"."}
{"text":"TL;DR  Food 6/10    Service 2/10

Sienna Mercato has been on my list of places to try for quite some time, and finally I had the chance. My family and I visited after a hot day in the city (Picklesburgh). My boys (ages 4 and 6) adore meatballs, so Emporio was definitely the place for us. We were seated quickly, and someone who identified themselves as \"the person who was not serving us, but would be refilling our water\" filled our glasses and left a bit of additional water at the table. Thank goodness that little bit of extra water was left for us, because our water was never refilled. 
Our server dropped off menus about 10 minutes later - we had wanted to order an appetizer but did not have the opportunity at this time. Maybe another 15 minutes passed before our server came back to take our order. We were told by the woman \"who would be refilling our water\" that the server would explain the meatball of the day to us. He didn't - we had to ask about it. At this time we ordered an appetizer along with our meals. I specifically stated that we wanted it was an appetizer. We didn't wait long at all for our food, and wouldn't you know the appetizer came out at the same time the entrees were delivered by the food runner. This is a particular pet peeve of mine. 
I had the classic beef meatball panini with spinach almond pesto - this was quite good. Both my kids had meatball sliders (also good), and my husband had a panini with government cheese. We all found the government cheese to be INCREDIBLY salty. 
Our server did not return to our table again to check on us until we were completely finished, and at that point we simply requested the check. I was hoping to see the \"person who was not serving us, but would be refilling our water\" because we were all fresh out of water, but she never returned. 
I'd go back for pretty decent food if the service was stellar, but that was not the case in my experience."}
{"text":"This review is for Emporio, the meatball section of the restaurant.  The place is good overall. Nice atmosphere although very dark and loud, more of a bar atmosphere than a restaurant. A little overpriced however the unique menu offers a little more value to the food. Meatballs were cooked well for my main course, however the Buffalo chicken balls as an appetizer were covered in celery and soaked in blue cheese. I would not come back however I would recommend going to try if you are a big fan of meatballs."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food was amazing with a lot of different options. The staff was very helpful, quick, and nice. I got the pork meatballs with Parmesan sauce over the tomato risotto. It was amazing. The drink menu is very good with good happy hour specials. The general feel of the restaurant is nice and it is pretty cheap price wise. I can't wait to go back. So Good!!"}
{"text":"Always a fan of Emporio. Would like to see them update the menu, specifically the sides. Mac and Cheese, which is usually on on point, was off the last time I was there. My favorite app has to be their pickle chips, but I'm also a biased southerner who enjoys everything fried."}
{"text":"Would be worth it just for the brussel sprouts alone, but the meatballs are phenomenal too."}
{"text":"I'll eat here ever time I'm in the burgh. Share the fries though, those baskets are overflowing.

Simple and delicious selection of meatballs, soups, pastas, and American staples."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed. The pizza sauce had a tang to it that was not very tasty. The size was small for the price as well. The portion for the meatball and spaghetti was also small. The meatballs are great but the pasta portion is unusually light. The sauce again didn't taste great. For the price we just won't head here again. We would rather go to an authentic pizza place or Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Parmesan fries were awesome, the meatball sliders were great. But the tots covered in gravy and cheese curds were off the hook!!"}
{"text":"Meatballs are legit. I really enjoyed the grinder and sliders but the sides were just okay."}
{"text":"This place gets two stars: one for really good food (classic poutine, saucy veg balls, and saucy pork balls). They lose three stars for each time my wife got yelled at for not following proper foot traffic patterns in the restaurant (apparently she took the wrong lane back to her seat from the bathroom?). We were told a 25-minute wait for a seat, but assented since a friend had recommended. We made our way to the elevator for the beer garden (after being shooed off the stairs) and only stood there for 5 minutes with a bunch of other people waiting for the slowest elevator before we got a text that our seat was ready. Except it wasn't actually ready. We stood at the host table another 5 minutes. It was there that we noticed the strange division of labor: hostesses were delivering food and tending bar; wait staff were seating people. It seemed like no one was really clear what they were supposed to be doing. When we were seated, we were finally greeted by someone who acted like she wanted us there. Our waitress took drink orders, came back to take our food orders. The appetizer arrived soon after...before the beers even. Then my wife's entree arrived at an incredibly quick interval, almost as though they had predicted her order. Then the waitress arrived with a confused look, which she attributed to my wife having her food and my not having mine. She went to figure it out and came back with a \"computer error\" explanation. Whatever the explanation, if my wife had continued to eat at her normal pace, she would have finished before my food ever came. By the time my food came, our dinner was already not worth it. Like I said, the food was good; our waitress was super apologetic and didn't charge for poutine (we added that money to her tip). I would try it again, but only if the illogical process to obtain one's food and the pretentious attitudes of a majority of the staff get straightened out."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites. There food is awesome and they atmosphere is great.  The only thing that sucks is the line for the roof on the weekends, but other than that this might be my favorite place to go downtown."}
{"text":"Everything is great about this place except the music. The music is terrible. Am I a 40 year old experiencing a mid-life crisis. Please change it up."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad but nothing draws me back either.  Most all Italian restaurants taste the same anyhow.  Atmosphere is modern, warm and cozy, but quite loud."}
{"text":"Incredibly unique offering, three floors with one dedicated to different variations of meatballs. The retractable roof bar on the third floor is a must visit for a cocktail."}
{"text":"Was staying in the Westin just down the street, and staff there recommended this place. It was a busy night downstairs so took advantage of a free seat at the bar upstairs. Overall, a fantastic experience. The cocktail list had a few truly unique options, and the Marcynez was amazing. Braised beef penne was unique and excellent, as was the wine. It's a busy, happening place but you never feel ignored even for a second. Michael, the bartender who commands the 2nd floor bar area, was perfect in his roles. I found myself sitting there again the next night, devouring a seafood risotto, wishing I could find an excuse to visit again soon."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend to Mezzo tonight for his birthday for the Italian food he was desperately craving. We saw how positive the reviews were and I was confident that we would have an awesome meal and great service. I can say we got 50% of that equation. The server, Vanessa, was awesome and even recommended a good place to grab drinks after the meal. I would actually love to hang out with her because she was a fellow Scorpio. However, I digress, let me walk through the food we ordered. We opted to try the Italian cheese tray. This tray doesn't not come with bread, so we did a small order of bread. The cheeses ranged from sweet and mild all the way to putrid and potent. This was an interesting spread and we enjoyed trying out all of the different types. We were off to a good start. After that, we opted for the sofrita pizza and a Caesar salad with Prosciutto on top. This was alright, however I don't think that salted meats are our thing. The sofrita pizza sauce was all but dried up underneath mozzarella slices and mushroom stems. The sauce I would describe as concentrate from a spaghetti-o's can. Very sweet and honestly dried up. I think next time we will opt for downstairs at Emporio to sample more mainstream fare, however we will miss Vanessa upstairs at Mezzo. Lastly, the ambiance is amazing. If I could've made dinner and brought it to the Mezzo dining room, that would've made for a perfect night!"}
{"text":"If you like meatballs, them this is the place to go. I like meatballs...but not THAT much that I would go to a specific meatball restaurant. (I went to this restaurant with work colleagues for lunch.) I would consider this restaurant a bit pricey for high end meatballs."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a well made meatball? My friend and I went here for dinner and drinks and had a fantastic time. 

We began by ordering the crispy pickle chips with a bacon-ranch dip and a glass of wine. After enjoying our appetizer, we chose our meatball selections. I had the regular beef with a creamy Parmesan sauce as a slider. My friend had the regular beef with the almond-spinach sauce as a meatball panini. We also noticed that SM keeps a fresh water bottle at the table, something which we appreciated.

The service was great, and as recent college grads, the price range was perfect. The atmosphere was great for catching up and feeling cool all at the same time.

We then made our way to Il Tetto, the rooftop beer garden. It was such an enjoyable experience. The bartenders were really nice and attentive. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the expansive beer list. We loved the open atmosphere of the rooftop beer garden and the view of some beautiful buildings in Pittsburgh. Since then, I've been here one other time with my mom, and am planning another visit to enjoy the meatballs and the rooftop bar!"}
{"text":"I went to Sienna Mercato on my birthday last week. I was searching for different places in Pittsburgh to try instead of the typical chain restaurant. What I loved most about the restaurant was the atmosphere of the restaurant! We sat in the Mezzo portion of Sienna Mercato. There are 2 other parts to Sienna Mercato including a meatball restaurant and a rooftop bar. The service was good, our waitress was very nice and informative. Receiving refills was a little slow but they were super busy, especially considering it was 2 days before Christmas. The food is different. It's definitely more of a swanky place. We tried one of the cheese and meat boards they offer. I really like that they receive all of their ingredients from local farms. They butcher, smoke, and cook the meat right there, so you know you're getting your food fresh! I would definitely say to give it a try! I want to try their meatball restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love love love the rooftop bar here. I've only actually eaten here once (at the meatball joint), but I'm always excited to go to the rooftop for a drink or two when I am in the city. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Snuck out for a mid-afternoon snack(!) after a pitiful \"lunch\" at Fresh Corner.

Sienna Mercato is located across the street from Somona Grille in the 900 block of Penn Avenue.

The place is hip, modern, industrial looking decor.  A definite welcome of this style to downtown.  This seems like a place you might find in the strip, but closer and available for lunch!

We were greeted quickly by a hostess and at our table quickly.  Great service all around.  We told the waiter we were in a hurry, and the food was out in minutes!

I tried four meatballs: the beef with Pesto, bacon cheeseburger with a cheese sauce, pork with the Bolognese, and a chicken meatball.

The Chicken Meatball had a slightly gamey taste, not sure the exact cause for that.  If I had bought (4) of these I would have sent them back.

Overall the meatballs were great -- but smallish, for a good lunch you need 3-4 for sure.

My favorite was definitely the pork!!

The rootbeer float was good, but the root beer itself was flat.  I had asked for more rootbeer, and they needed to charge me $4.00 for \"another\" Draft Root Beer.  I wouldn't have complained solely about that, but it came out completely flat.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Upstairs was a sauna, downstairs food was poor quality, cheap American Italian, service was ok, second floor was good, good service, but hot and stuffy, decor was great all round , a/c and more attention to food would b beneficial..."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and this place was great! The idea of meatballs was a bit of a turn off, but the food was so fresh and delicious- definitely exceeded my expectations!! The Brussel sprouts were amazing with the chicken balls and the creamy parm sauce! Highly recommend if you are in town! Service was great and atmosphere is casual and trendy!"}
{"text":"Sienna Mercato is a 3 story restaurant offering 3 unique dining experiences to locals & those visiting Pittsburgh. When you come, be prepared to make a decision as to what floor you would like to dine on. Below you will find a breakdown of the three levels at Sienna and what they have to offer.

1. Emporio: in Italian, the word emporio translates into \"general store\" - a local place where people can go to find what they are looking for fairly quickly. That is exactly what Emporio at Sienna is: a go-to, street level destination in the heart of Pittsburgh's thriving food scene. Emporio is a meatball joint - yep, meatballs. They serve four essential balls (beef, chicken, pork, and vegetarian) and feature a special meatball at the beginning of each month. This concept was new to Pittsburgh and still remains the only place in the Steel City where the specialty is meatballs. Emporio does well as a city restaurant because it is the type of place where you can walk in, no reservation needed, and spend less than $20 for an exciting and filling meal. When you order at Emporio, you choose everything, including the sauce that comes with your meatballs and the style that you would like it served to you (on a sandwich, over spaghetti, in soup, etc.) - the possibilities are endless. The vibe at Emporio is casual, fun, and trendy. There are several T.V screens around the restaurant featuring sporting events as well as bar seating with full service. You can walk in without a reservation and most likely be seated immediately. If you plan on coming during restaurant peak hours, especially on the weekends, it is a good idea to utilize the app \"NoWait\" and get in line for a table. If you do not have the app and prefer to not download it, you can simply call the restaurant and ask if they are on a wait yet. Emporio keeps customers coming back because there is always a new combination to try and it is a fun time for not a lot of money. The meatballs are tasty and the options are infinite! 
2. Mezzo: Mezzo is the second story of Sienna. This restaurant offers a completely different dining experience than Emporio but, just as good. Mezzo's ambiance is quiet, cozy, and intimate. It's fine dining without the tablecloths and feels more like a family gathering than eating out at a restaurant. The menu at Mezzo is a chef-inspired Italian fair / farm to table concept, specializing in wood fire, Neapolitan style pizza as well as a charcuterie, cheese plates, and more. Mezzo is delightful. It's everything you want out of a trendy Italian spot in downtown. It is the type of environment that you take your parents out to, a first date, a bachelorette dinner, or just a solo bite and drink at the bar. Offering a quiet dining experience and one of the best wine selections in downtown Pittsburgh, Mezzo is true to Italian flavors and to Pittsburgh style at the same time. With seating overlooking bustling Penn Avenue, you will not be disappointed sharing pizza, sampling cheese, or sipping espresso at Mezzo. All ingredients used at Mezzo come from the Western Pennsylvania region, which makes it even more special. This level of Sienna takes reservations through \"Open Table\" or by phone. I recommend calling in to book a reservation, as they fill up quickly. Mezzo is one bite of goodness, wrapped up in porchetta, and sprinkled with parmesan. Again, it is delightful.
3. Il Tetto: in Italian, \"tetto\" translates to \"roof\" and that's exactly where you are when you go to Il Tetto. Offering apps and a huge selection of drinks this is the place where you want to start your evening, finish off your night or, both. Tetto is the longest rooftop bar in Pittsburgh. It features a retractable roof so that the fun doesn't stop even when it starts to rain. The bar is long but, there is also seating available on a first come first serve basis. This is a fun environment, with string lights, a nice view, and the volume increasing as the night goes on. The rooftop opens at 4pm every evening and stays open late, food being served until midnight. If you come on a weekend, expect to see a line to get up to the roof. It may be the longest bar in Pittsburgh but, due to its popularity, the rooftop does reach maximum capacity pretty easily. 

Sienna Mercato is all about giving people options. It's like this guy and his wife had three great ideas and decided to stack them all on top of one another...and, it worked. Sienna creates an experience that you can pick and choose from. Engulf yourself in one floor, or try a little bit of each. Regardless, Sienna Mercato will keep you coming back and waiting in line for a new experience every time. It's good, times 3. Enjoy!

- xoxo, A

{"text":"2nd trip to the restaurant and I would be completely won over if it wasn't for the 3rd floor elevator access.  So bizarre. 

For those of you don't know in order to access to the third floor (Beer Garden) you have to take the elevator.  There are stairs but only for staff use.  If t's a Friday or Saturday night you have to wait in line. No kidding! I visited over the weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday and spent the majority of the evening waiting in line to take the elevator.   I have no problem going up and down stairs but waiting in line for an elevator this is not how I prefer to spend my evening.  I saw a sign in the elevator that they need to monitor the person count on the 3rd floor or something!?  When it was time to leave.. I just wanted to go ..but again I had to wait in line to take the elevator downstairs.    I felt completely trapped. What if there is a fire or god forbid some other type of disaster!?Will everyone know where the stairs are located?!    If I visit again.. staying put on the first floor."}
{"text":"BALLS! Hahahaha! The rooftop is the real gem!

I've been here several time while in town for convention center events and lunch dates with friends. I love the inventive menu and monthly meatball selection. They really break the mold with recipes. 
I think the craziest item I have had was in March, corned beef meatball and it was so delicious and different. 
I have been back on good weather nights to hit the roof top bar and it is a lovely view and kinda romantic sans hundreds of yinzers milling about!

Disappointments include Matzo Ball Soup and hit and miss poutine combos. 

The location is facing new and stiff taco competition right around the corner now! Be bold and keep us interested!"}
{"text":"GROSS.  We came here because of the good yelp reviews and because they have gluten free options on their menu, which I require. There actually aren't many gf options- there is gf pasta and sauce and only one kind of meatballs. The salads-which you would think would be gluten free, are not listed as such so they must not be. I thought the tomato sauce was sour and acidic and gross. The pasta was edible but the meatballs were mushy. I was really unhappy with this place as they make a big deal about being gluten free friendly but they do not deliver the goods. This was our last night in Pittsburgh and a friend of mine raved about this place, but my experience was terrible and left a bad taste in my mouth. If you are looking for gluten free options, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fabulous food. We ordered every appetizer as a large group, we ended up ordering several of them again.

Special note: this restaurant is located upstairs. Food is much better if you go upstairs vs just having meatballs downstairs at their sister restaurant."}
{"text":"Meatballs good but drinks a bit pricy for an average cocktail. I would go again for the meatballs though. Atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite drink spot in downtown Pittsburgh, arguably. The top floor makes for the ideal downtown urban rooftop happy hour/post show. The open concept, strung lights and balcony overlooking Penn are perfect after dark. The crowd is exactly what I want - younger professionals and polite, even when the space is packed. And the bartenders are always friendly and gifted. I absolutely love it here.

You do have to take an elevator to the third floor, so that can be a bit of an annoyance - the stairs are only available for emergencies (and sneaking out for a cigarette). The second floor serves incredible food as well. We did my best friend's birthday here and it was amazing (although our server wasn't the best - but I won't hold it against this gem of a bar, just her.) - I haven't tried the first floor food, but my coworkers do lunch meetings there and I've heard great things."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere especially if you sit on the rooftop. Good drinks and good food! You pay for both the experience and the food."}
{"text":"I haven't had anything here that I didn't like. I've been here a few times, and each time is great! I love the \"meatball of the month\" option! It's always fun to taste the meatball that will only be around for a little while. There are a lot of options on the menu!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, prompt service, solid food, and well poured cocktails...easy like Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"There are three levels. The top is a beer garden that has a retractible roof. One of the best spots to be in Pittsburgh when the weather is nice. The first floor is a meatball restaurant. Not nearly as good as the Meatball Shop in NY but still good. The second floor is the gem, a great Italian place with great pizza and charcuterie. I tried the seafood risotto, it was delicious. I wish amazing places like this existed when I lived in downtown Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I went to Emporio yesterday for lunch, and it was TREMENDOUS.  First, the ambiance of the place in and of itself is spectacular.  Dimly lit with artsy lighting (think bare, clear light bulbs, very industrial), dark wood walls, and cozy booths make Emporio very inviting.  There are plenty of (high, modern, metal) stools around the large bar, as well.  

I didn't have a drink at lunch (I have to work, unfortunately), but there was an extensive list of beers on the chalkboard on the wall.  (also a feature I like).

The menu is divided up into appetizers, salads, soups, meatballs and sides.  You can get a \"ball\" on anything.  It's $2 to add a \"ball\" to your soup, salad, or side.  You can get $10 \"saucy balls\" - 4 meatballs in a sauce of your choice (and the sauce list is extensive!) and get a $4-5 side, and the meatballs and sauce will arrive graced over your side.  There are 4 different choices of meatball and 1 special every day.  The usual meatballs are beef, chicken, pork and veggie.  

One thing I really liked about the menu is that it denoted which items were vegetarian and which are gluten-free.  For me, a person who avoids gluten, this proved very helpful.  

I had the beef meatballs because I couldn't resist (despite the fact that they are not gluten free), with arrabiata sauce (GF) and white beans & escarole as the side to accompany the balls.  (also GF).  My one lunch partner had the same while the other started with an appetizer of arancini balls before digging into some meatballs.  

The beef meatballs were rather amazing.  They were moist and perfectly cooked, and were very well-seasoned.  They were just tremendous.  The arrabiata sauce was just a little spicy, like the waitress advertised.  The beans and greens were done well, and the combination between the arrabiata-sauced meatballs and the side was a nice pairing.  I couldn't get enough of the dish, ate it all, and was pleasantly full after (it helped that I had a 10 minute walk back to my office after).  My friends were similarly pleased with their meals.  I can't wait to see what is in store for Emporio and the other floors of Sienna Mercato when they open!  I might just become a regular.  Truly fantastic."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Had cocktails in the beer garden followed by dinner on the 2nd floor at Mezzo. Delicious.  Can't wait to come back on our next visit to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Emporio (first floor) is amazing!! Joanna is the greatest server and Troy a most-excellent manager! We celebrated our anniversary downtown and dined here in the evening. We love the chill environment and fun menu. Everything we ordered was incredible. We will definitely be back...and can hardly wait for the location in Wexford to open!"}
{"text":"After no service at Sonoma, I wandered across the street to Sienna Mercato. I was immediately greeted and seated. My sever came quickly as did my food. I had never dined here and found the concept interesting. I had the spicy pork meatballs in a panini with arribita sauce. Excellent. I also tried the mac and cheese with government cheese. Very good as well. I would eat here again. I would like to try the upper floors as well."}
{"text":"Great decor and the people are incredibly friendly and attentive. Food is great. Background music too loud for conversation. (My opinion) Charcuterie is pricey but very tasty. Lots of talent and creativity in that kitchen!"}
{"text":"This place is as great as remembered and made a wonderful date night out. 
We started at the bar upstairs with drinks and pretzels and enjoyed them in the cool night air. 
Then down to meatball Emporio for dinner. BTW, you can use no wait while upstairs and take them elevator down. Our timing was perfect in that table was ready as we were walking out of bar. We love this placd, it's definitely one of our favorites! Even though we live closers to their Wexford location and have enjoyed visits there, the main location on Penn is preferred."}
{"text":"'Get in line' on the NoWait App and make sure your reservation is for Sienna Mercato, \"The Meatball Joint,\" and not one of the other floors of the restaurant. This is one of our favorite places for happy hour or their late night happy hour. We love the meatballs in all forms and the mac and cheese with government cheese is a guilty pleasure. We appreciate the 'birthday panini' so I suggest you sign up their mailing list ASAP. This place keeps getting better and better and I'm always dying to see their new 'Ball of the Month.' Perfect addition to the cultural district and the 'Burgh! And now the Penguins area? Dreams do come true."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, the roof top bar is great but the service I receive there is below average and very disappointing."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here but I did indulge in the roof-top bar!  Good beer and a lovely view of Pittsburgh!!!!  Good times!"}
{"text":"Excellent ambience and clearly a trendy popular place. A great menu and loved the Pennsylvania cheese plate and olives. The vegetatarian risotto was delicious .
Vibrant atmosphere and cool decor .
If you like Italian a must when in Pittsburgh . Look forward to trying the pizza next time"}
{"text":"At the rooftop bar and ordered Barbacoa Nachos for $12.  Received a plate of chips with some beans and very little Barbacoa.  Complained to the serving staff about the limited toppings and was told I would have to pay for additional toppings.  The cost would be $4.  Unacceptable for $12 nachos.  I've been here 3 times now and every time I leave disappointed.  I recommend to avoid this place."}
{"text":"The roof bar is great, and I will keep going back for that. Nice cocktails. The Sienna Mercato menu though? Pretty uninspired. I don't understand why this place is so popular. Adequate noodles, overcooked veggies, chef-boyardee grade meatballs. Altogether, edible but I would not go back."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the first floor because I really don't like their meatballs.  I love the atmosphere of the second floor and am crazy about their risottos!!  I've have a bunch of different ones, and can't wait to go again!  I'll be back..."}
{"text":"I lived in Pittsburgh for a year and this was my go to place to watch sports and drink beer. Mercato has one of the best beer selections in downtown which is constantly changing. They have many big TVs so you can always get a good view or one or two sporting events that are going on. The food is fresh, good quality and a good value. The staff is very friendly and Matt who bartends there got to know my beer taste and after a few months always recommended something I would like out of the 30 or so beers on tap. I consider myself pretty picky about beer too."}
{"text":"Calling all Pittsburgh foodies this is the new downtown hot spot!!  I love meatballs and could not wait to try this place out. They do not take reservations but are on No Wait and we really did not have to wait at all-it was a Sunday night but the place was bumping!  They had a nice selection of draft beers-I went with my favorite White Lightening by Full Pint.  We started with the buffalo chicken meatballs (tasted just like boneless buffalo wings) which was mixed in a sauce with blue cheese and shredded celery-the perfect combo and not too spicy. Now on to the exciting part picking your meatballs and sauce.  I went with the classic beef meatballs on a Panini with gouda cheese (you can pick from 3 cheeses). They had a variety of sauces and I stuck with the classic tomato sauce. It was the perfect combo of sweet and savory and a terrific combo.  For my side I went with the pasta fagiolo which was delicious. They have a nice selection of soups including wedding soup and matzo ball soup and you can add meatballs to any of them for a small charge. My date ordered the saucy balls-you get 4 meatballs although you cannot mix and match.  He went with the spicy pork with the tzatziki sauce to cool it down a little. The tzatzikii sauce was fantastic!  For $4 extra dollars you can have the balls put on a side and he choose the tomato risotto (different flavor each day).  The service was great, loved the atmosphere and can't wait to go back and try out more combos!!"}
{"text":"EMPORIO!!! It sounds like a spell from Harry Potter and the actual place is just as magical.  The meatballs are good, really good, really really good.  The sides are also amazing.  My boyfriend, who doesn't eat cheese, came back for seconds on their creamy parmesan mac and cheese.  We always go at least once a month to see what their meatball of the month is.  Their corned beef meatball and stuffed pepper meatball are two of my favorite specialty ones and their spicy pork meatball is always my go to when i'm there.  Spicy pork meatball with their basil pesto...yes...just try it...yes.
I have not had one bad thing to eat here and the service has always been great.  We like to go for happy hour before the place gets too packed and that is also a great time.  Half off drafts with a very varied draft list that still always has a few staples on there as well.
Once I'm all filled up on meatballs the upper deck is just a great place to relax with friends.  It's so open and a gorgeous downtown spot.
I have not tried the second floor yet but if it's even half as good as the first and third floor I'm guessing it's pretty great."}
{"text":"Sienna Mercato really is a total crowd pleaser. I've been to their rooftop biergarten, Il Tetto, several times in winter. It's enclosed under a glass rooftop in the cold months, which feels pretty magical. The cocktails up there are very good with great presentation.

More recently I've tried the downstairs Emporio and was equally pleased. You can make pretty much any combination of meatballs and sides, sandwiches, pasta you can dream up here which is quite fun but I'll admit it can be hard to for an indecisive person like me to make a final choice. I choose the vegetarian meatball slider with arrabiata sauce some of their nicely steamed parmasean broccoli and liked everything, especially the spicy red sauce. My friends tried a whole variety ranging from the traditional beef meatball on a panini, mac and cheese, salad, risotto and everyone agree the food was yummy! You really can't go wrong here. And we thought the service was good too, friendly and good suggestions.

Next, I'll have to try Mezzo."}
{"text":"Yum.  This restaurant is within walking distance of many of the downtown hotels and is on a great block filled with trendy restaurants and bars.
The restaurant has a very fresh vibe and was filled with patrons of all ages.  We waited about 5 minutes for a table during peak dinner hours.
The bruschetta was delicious, perfectly balanced.  The meatballs were good, had a nice flavor, but were a little soft for my tastes. They'd have been better with a hard sear on them but the sauce was wonderful and the bread provided a great crispy foil to the soft meatballs.
Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. If we lived here we'd definitely make this a go to spot!"}
{"text":"Went to a happy hour here on the deck. Cocktails were good but a little overpriced in my opinion. I considered ordering an appetizer or two but did not because the prices on the bar menu seemed unreasonable to me for a happy hour. Good location though with a large rooftop deck/full bar that can get crowded."}
{"text":"Chicken meatballs were very flavorful and paired well with the basil pesto cream sauce. Veg ball was very good too but heavy since the base is white beans, mushroom and cauliflower. Three balls was enough for me. Also got a side of green beans that were perfectly cooked with toasted almonds sprinkled on top. Yum!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for lunch before work this afternoon. Was seated fairly quickly and presented with a menu. If you like meatballs, this IS the place for you!! My server Ashley was attentive and explained the different options thoroughly. I decided on a beef meatball panini with smoked Gouda and mushroom gravy. They also have vegetarian options and turkey for those who don't do red meat. Will be back to try the other options soon!!!"}
{"text":"Came here to have weekday afternoon beers. Great roof deck with a big bar and upbeat ambiance. Service was attentive and every beer we tried was quite good."}
{"text":"I just attended a large event there and had a great time. The wait staff was very attentive, the bartenders we're amazing, and the manager was on top of everything. I wouldn't hesitate to return!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal.  Thankful for the veggie meatballs.  I feel like the texture of them could've been a little less mooshy though.  I love that you get to pick a sauce.  The waitress was also very helpful in regards to how to order, and the sauce descriptions.  Also, a pretty decent beer selection.  The vibe was low key, but still a busy place.  Well organized, streamlined.  We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Visited numerous times for drinks and apps had great food and service.   Waited for the new Mezzo to opened but was a enormous waste of time.  Tried to have a birthday dinner for my girlfriend there total fail.  Did not even \"try\" to accommodate for their mistake.   Left and had an amazing time at  http://ilpizzaiolo.com/mobile.  After venting and contacting a manager about the situation, he wrote me an extensive email about how this happens all the time there and offered nothing to satisfy a lost customer or should I say 10 customers.  

Avoid."}
{"text":"Walked in at 3:11pm saw the upstairs was roped off. I asked if I could go up and just look real quick (I am scouting a place for a future party) they rudely said it's closed. And no I can't go up till 4pm. I never got a chance to say why I wanted to see it."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, but thats about it.  The wedding soup was cold and bland and the meatballs I had were dried out and without much flavor.

I'll give it another try when the upstairs opens, but for now I'll pass."}
{"text":"I ordered the City of Champyinz (clever pun huh), which came with chicken balls, spaghetti, chicken chilli, and American cheese sprinkled on top. I've never tried chili with spaghetti or even with chicken balls. But it was a pleasant surprise. The texture of the chicken balls aren't as put together and thick as meatballs normally would be but still delicious. 

My friend and I split the poutine which we ordered with house cut fries and bacon bits sprinkled on top. We were able to choose a sauce and we got the Crack Sauce. Yes, you read it right haha. And I knew exactly why when I first tried it. It's a mixture of ranch and hot sauce, and it was just as tasty and addicting as its name implies. 

Lastly, my friend ordered the Fuggetta-Bowl-It! This is one of its popular dishes. It's a creamy Parmesan spaghetti with classic beef meatballs in meat sauce and shaved Parmesan on top. I don't think you can ever be disappointed by the classic spaghetti and meatballs. The only thing that I thought was a little off for my taste was that the meatball in this dish tasted much saltier than my meatballs. But the weird thing was that my friend was saying the exact opposite of my reaction... don't know how that happened haha. 

The food is a bit pricey and salty so I'd give it a 4/5. The service was good and the space is really big so I don't think seating would be a problem, since this place has 3 floors.

I'd definitely want to check out the rooftop bar next time!"}
{"text":"Delicious beef meatball grinder with marinara and a side of spaghetti with bolognese sauce. Our table also shared the crab ball appetizer which was also good. Service was fast and friendly and the atmosphere was nice. I would return again."}
{"text":"I've literally gotten every ball from these guys. From the vegetarian to the pork and the chicken as well, I have never been disappointed. The sauces really make me happy.

There are three separate leves here, the bottom floor is for the balls, middle for pizza and other things such as salads and the top is a rooftop bar. At night in the fall, the rooftop bar is worth the crowd to see the beautiful skyline and drink one of the MANY beers on tap. Great cocktails as well."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Mezzo for the longest time and finally decided to do so Saturday night. My best friend and I didn't even mind having to wait 45 minutes for a table because our waitress was extremely nice and the ambiance of the restaurant was so fun and exciting. Even though it was loud, it was fine. First, our water came out warm; but we didn't complain. We were so excited to get poutine since we haven't had any from Canada in almost a year. Once it came out were were extremely disappointed. The fries were covered in mozzarella cheese, not cheese curds, and the chicken gravy was chalky as if it was powered. My pesto spaghetti portion was extremely small for the price. I don't think I'll be returning, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Had the 4 meatball plate with spinach-almond-pesto, over the tomato risotto, which was killer!  Note to self: come back here when you're in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"A pretty good place to stop in for a beer or some eatery after work in the Downtown area.  Largely made up of large parties of business types, it's just not really my type of crowd.  A nice rooftop (almost greenhouse) for when the weather is nice, but it gets rather crowded easily."}
{"text":"I went here for a work happy hour, and this place was hopping! Before the happy hour, I had never heard of it, and to be honest, I don't know how I missed it! We had some difficulty getting seated with the host and hostess, but our waitress more than made up for this. She was very knowledgeable, honest, and helpful. I ordered the wedding soup with a beef meatball; the meatball was fantastic bursting with garlic flavor! I found myself adding salt to the wedding soup itself. We ate light so that we could try some desserts; I tried the ricotta doughnuts which were excellent! I also tried the red velvet doughnut balls. The ricotta doughnuts are served warm sprinkled with powdered sugar with a bowl of chocolate dipping sauce. The red velvet doughnut balls are served cold and compacted with cream cheese-like frosting. Both were good, but I thought the ricotta doughnuts were much better---crispy on the outside, but chewy and warm on the inside! The next time I come here, I'd like to see what the Rooftop Beer Garden is all about; it was closed for a private event when we went."}
{"text":"I have been to Sienna Mercato many times, but only to the roof top beer garden! This last time I went, I had dinner and it was delicious! We ate on the first floor, the Emporio: Meatball Joint. My boyfriend and I both got the grinders, which was three meatballs of your choice, cheese, and sauce. I had the chicken meatballs, provolone cheese and crack sauce (ranch and hot sauce!). My boyfriend had beef meatballs, provolone, and marinara sauce. We loved our meals! We also shared tater tots and the Parmesan-herb fries. The fries were great but a large portion, so I recommend sharing! I would love to try the second floor next because they have a more selection on their menu other than meatballs."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. I got the Cajun meatball special, which came with a lobster cream sauce, on a hoagie. Very affordable prices, good service, and tasty meatballs"}
{"text":"We have been regulars at Emporio for a few years.  It's a fun concept and the fact that they use No Wait to manage the host stand allows us to make last minute plans.  While I'm sad that the recent menu refresh eliminated the spinach almond pesto the additions of crack sauce and spaetzle more than make up for it."}
{"text":"I'm not overly impressed based on the hype and recommendations from colleagues, but it was decent enough for three stars.

I will admit the meatballs were very good, however was the sides that really downgraded this restaurant to me. The Caesar salad was terrible. The dressing was way too fishy, and way too much was put onto the salad.  The Parmesan and herb fries were rather bland undercooked and just not very good.

I am not from the area and likely won't patronize on future trips to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"2 story Italian restaurant with unique food choices and themes on each floor. I ate on the second floor and we ordered the margarita pizza, arugula salad, and beef tartar with an amazing bottle of chianti and for dessert the chocolate hazelnut marjolaine. I have no complaints about the food or the service. I am excited to come back!"}
{"text":"What a great experience. Went to check out the new Emporio before going to the car how this weekend. 
Walking into the place, whoever did the branding and the design of the interior absolutely deserve a high-five. Just a great feel with the rustic wood, exposed metal. 
We had a party of 9 and the Host, Ryan, did a great job of accommodating us and making sure that we knew he was on top of things. The other hostess was helpful as well, pointing out some of her favorites and making recommendations. (She was right, the Ricotta Donuts were the perfect finish to the meal)
Liked the simple menu on a clipboard idea. Very nice clean execution. The menu it self is very simple, 4 kinds of balls and a handful of sauces. The only problem is it creates so many combinations of flavors, what to try first.
We went with Cheesy Bread (that day'special), Fried Buffalo Chicken Balls and Crab Stuffed Mushrooms. 
The Cheesy Bread was light and crispy, not too much cheese to overwhelm the herbs and pepper flakes.
The Buffalo Chicken Balls were something totally different, just the right amount of fruity heat and a mix of textures (Crispy outside, juicy and tender in)
The crab stuffed mushrooms were different from the usual as well. A touch of citrus flavor left us wondering if there was such a thing as \"fresh crab\" as opposed to the canned stuff we are all used to.

For the main course, we just grabbed a couple of each ball and 5 sauces to dip them in, figuring that was the only way to satisfy our need to try everything that we had been smelling. We were not disappointed by anything we ate.
The biggest hit had to be the Bolognese Sauce. Chunky and thick, though the taste was lighter than you would imagine and the touch of cinnamon at the finish really complemented the balls.
The added plus of dining this way, was that instead of being consumed by the food in front of us, we were constantly passing plates of meatballs and recommending sauces with a \"you've gotta try this\" thrown in here and there, making for a very communal dining  experience.

Overall, a great dining experience (the servers were helpful, friendly and pleasant.) the food was delicious and the atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"This is a brilliant idea: one place, three restaurant options, three different floors. First floor serves meatballs, second floor serves pizza and pasta and third floor serves beer and drinks. Personally, my favorite is Emporio, the meatball joint. The food is good and reasonably priced, and they have the same drinks that are served on the 3rd floor. I've just about tried every meatball and every sauce here and they've all been satisfying. I usually get a couple sliders of different meat and sauce combos so I can sample as many of their offerings as possible. The fries and poutine are great and so are their salads. There's not much you can go wrong with here. As far as Mezzo, the pizza and pasta floor, it's ok. I've had way better pizza at other places in town. And for Il Tetto, the beer garden, the atmosphere is nice so it gets a crowd. However, keep in mind that the first floor has the same prices and they also have happy hour specials, which Il Tetto does not have. Overall, great concept. The meatballs will have you coming back."}
{"text":"I came to this place hungry, and it didn't disappoint. I had the Angry Bird - chicken meatballs served over Mac n cheese with crack sauce (ranch and hot sauce.) It was incredible, and more than enough food. They have a great beer menu and a nice atmosphere. Our wait time was 45 mins to an hour on a Saturday night, but we anticipated this and grabbed a drink while we waited. Overall this was my favorite restaurant that I visited on my trip to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I went for the meatballs and stayed for the drafts. 
Alright I don't drink beer but I love a good cold cider on a hot day. I popped in to blow off time before the pens game down town a few weeks ago. I tried a few of their meatballs and i really liked them, I wasn't super hungry so I need to go back with an actual appetite. Also I need that mac and cheese. I need to eat everything they make. It all smelled SO good. The pricing was not bad but BE WARNED... thursday is reverse happy hour so there is no specials until 9 p.m. i believe. We had chosen this place for the happy hour special and upon realizing it wasn't happening, WAY too late we said screw it and stayed anyway."}
{"text":"I remember going to Sienna Mercato about 3 years ago and the meatball was beyond amazing. 
However 3 years later, I'm honestly not too impressed by the meatballs anymore :( 
The side pasta was also very mediocre, which is disappointing. 
I would come again to check out the roof top bar, but probably no more meatballs for me."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to eat here last night for the first time. We were a group of 10. We had reservations and our table was ready when we got there. For a Tuesday night in downtown Pittsburgh, I was surprised at how crowed they were!
Our seating was on Mezzo. 
I have to say I was disappointed. We started with an appetizer of sausage and peppers. Although they were tasty, they were only Luke warm. And any good Italian knows that when you are eating something like this, you need bread to sop up the sauce! But that is another $3.00! ( which we did pay)
The main course also was not hot when it was served. My husband got the meatball pizza special, and said the meatballs were bland.
Refills for drinks was also slow.  One of our dinner mates ordered a second beer and was done with his panini before it ever arrived.
Would I go back again ? Maybe in the summer when I could take advantage of the rooftop seating and view!
After last nights experience I would give this place 21/2 stars."}
{"text":"Loved it. Long wait on a Sat night for table of 6 but worth it. Great service, beer list and everyone loved their food. I had the spicy pork on a panini with pesto and tater tots. Awesome stuff.  Would prefer that they take reservations, though."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Sienna in Market Square many times and heard that the same chef was expanding to a new concept of 3 restaurants offering differing Italian themed menus. Well the 1st of three Emporio has recently opened and I was totally impressed with the meatball menu and the draft beer selection. It was hard to pick from the menu so I ordered a few things. The meatballs were OUTSTANDING! 

The second concept of this trifecta is Pork based and it is my understanding that they will be butchering and preparing many wonderful Pork dishes. This is supposed to happen sometime around March 1st. 

The crowning event will open sometime late spring, and will be an Italian Beer Garden. 
I think someone said it would have a variety of food selections and of course a great draft beer line up!

In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger...\"I'll be back\""}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, especially during the warmer months! The rooftop deck is beautiful and provides a very different view of the city skyline. Very big and seasonally-changing drink menu provides many different options. Variety of different foods to choose from, but you really can't go wrong with a classic margherita pizza. They also have a tiki lounge on the roof every Sunday, with tons of different tropical, fun drinks. Will definitely be back, again and again!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy a meal at Emporio. The beef and vegetarian meatballs with the arrabiata sauce is my favorite. Great place to grab a meal before a Pirates game, or just a casual meal with friends."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in downtown! One of the few rooftop bars and the only one with a retractable roof so you can still be up there in rain or winter months. It is super crowded there but a good spot for a happy hour or a night out with a group!"}
{"text":"Staying on 6th and Grant, I was looking to explore the city a bit and find some local grub with good beer options. Mercato is just that. 

I strolled in as an obvious biz traveler - I think my branded polo blew my cover - and posted up at the bar. The atmosphere in here is a bit classy but the bar also gives off an inviting, more casual vibe. As soon as I bellied up, I asked for the Love Nitro Stout - I prefer Left Hand's over this one, but it was pretty good nonetheless. 

My meal started with the rocket salad - arugula, almonds, tomatoes, and fresh mozzarella. The almonds add great texture and the mozz tasted fresh. Next, I got the vegetarian meatballs- yea that's a thing. Mushrooms, white beans, and cauliflower make up the mixture and it is goooood. I made my serving a panini with the almond, spinach pesto - wow! Finally I got ice cream for dessert. If they have black raspberry then I totally just made your decision for you.

Andrew at the bar was friendly and indulged me in a local culture lesson - sports, food, neighborhoods, districts, etc. If you're looking for laid back, casual, and sarcastic conversation then he's your dude. 

Come here with plenty of time to spare - not an \"in and out\" kind of place. Hope you enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Not sure about the different concepts on all three levels...Meatball sub was good and they had a great beer selection."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the rooftop in the summer- great vibes but very busy. It would be very easy to enter the restaurant and not be aware of the other floors- I was dragged along by friends, so I'm lucky to know about the top floor. I've only been for drinks, so I can't rate the gluten friendliness --but I'm excited to go again. If you're looking for a fun atmosphere for late night drinks, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"With only 3 visits so far, I can safely recommend this to anyone. I have gotten the panini each time with a new dipping sauce and meatball. If I find anything here that is less than satisfactory I would be surprised."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times now for lunch.  Nice atmosphere, good service, decent food.  Not sure why I keep coming back though.  Everything is overpriced.  Small portions.  Those two comments really sum this place up."}
{"text":"Emporio made fantastic food, surprisingly filling, and a nice upscale twist on rustic home cooking.

Darryl has enough personality for several restaurants!"}
{"text":"I had the special meatball slider, philly cheese meatball slider, so super good, easpecially after 4 beers.. lol. I got one to go and i was not as impressed. not sure if it was the beer or the to-go factor."}
{"text":"Sienna Mercato has a great Italian restaurant in the second floor. I recommend sharing a pizza for two. Portions are very generous. The local cheese plate is very good also. One drawback: noisy environment as the restaurant gets crowdy."}
{"text":"Guys, I love this place. I have been here multiple times, and I have literally no complaints. Oh wait, yes I do. Their rooftop bar is only opened on the weekends during the colder months. I mean, I get it, but it's sad. 

Each floor is a different type of restaurant, which is a unique vibe for Pittsburgh. I have eaten at Emporio a handful of times, and I have been to the rooftop bar, but I've never gone to Il Tetto. At Emporio, I always get meatball sliders - the pesto sauce is my go-to on a  beef or chicken meatball. They are small enough to try a few, and if you're like me you will still have some room for a side. The tomato risotto is seriously everything. The mac and cheese with the creamy parm sauce is also a good side choice, but honestly just get the risotto. You won't regret it. 

The rooftop bar has an awesome vibe for a happy hour any time of the year. During the winter, it is only open on the weekends which has tripped my plans a few times. They have a decent beer and cocktail selection. I haven't gotten wine there, but I think they have decent choices in that department too. The prices are what you would expect for a more upscale place downtown."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Sienna for a long time, as I've always heard great things. I finally got to after working a show at the convention center recently. I wasn't entirely sure of what the format of the place was until I went. The first floor is a more casual restaurant where they specialize in meatballs. The second floor is a little fancier full service restaurant (by fancy, I don't mean dress wise. You'd still be fine wearing jeans. But it's a \"fancy\" full italian menu). I think there is a beer garden on the third level. I've not tried the meatball part of Mercato or the beer garden, but after how great the first experience was, I'll definitely be back to try both.

We ordered a small cheese and small meat board to start. Both are great appetizers. For my dinner I had the lamb & tagliatelle pasta. It was amazing. If you've never been, it's good to keep in mind they cook all their past al dente..which is how it should be! But some people aren't used to it. They also butcher all their meat in-house..and it's farm-to-table! Very cool. 

Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful. I also loved the atmosphere. Great place to eat downtown!"}
{"text":"One of the best parts of a restaurant is consistency and Sienna Mercato nails it every time. I have visited Emporio (the meatball joint) and Il Tetto (the rooftop beer garden) several times and all of my experiences have been wonderful! 

Emporio is a wonderful place to bring guests of all ages because the unique concept is something fun that anyone can get behind! I've tried tons of varieties of meatballs/sauces/serving styles and I've never been disappointed! Beware: the meatballs are big and your eyes may be bigger than your stomach! 

Il Tetto is a great place for a night out! There's a lot of awesome beverage choices and you can't beat the atmosphere. Even on a rainy night, you can still see the burgh's tallest buildings standing tall. 

Located right on Penn in the heart of the cultural District, there's nothing not to love about Sienna Mercato."}
{"text":"Very good food. Some dishes were very unique such as the onion & apple soup. Service was good with very knowledgeable waitress.   WiFi was also available.   

It was a rushed service as they told us they had another reservation, otherwise we would have stayed for desert.   

Craft beer selection was also good."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I was really surprised at all of the options I had at a meatball joint! The veggie balls are tasty (lol), and there are multiple toppings that are veg friendly. I like the mushroom gravy the best... Then maybe the spicy sauce (it starts with an A, something like Arribiata???). The beer selection is also pretty kick ass. Service has never been bad, or even that slow. We were there on NYE and service was still pretty snappy. The upstairs bar area is also super cool.

Overall great place!"}
{"text":"Had a totally different experience the last time I was there.  Great improvement from the first time.  The waiter was charming and knowledgable and the food was excellent. The service was top notch! The only thing I would change is for them to have a slightly larger selection of wine."}
{"text":"Fun place with three floors and three distict themes.  I visited the \"Meatball\" restaurant called Emporia on the first floor and the rooftop bar with a retractable roof on floor three, Il Trello.  Crowded but fun crowd.  Great service.  Third floor menu is really small and appetizers only.  It advertises bar food but you won't find a meal here.  Make sure you get your name on the list for Emporia or have reservations for Italian on the second floor if you are there for more than a few drinks and some buffalo dip and chips.  I was expecting wings or a burger in Il Trello.  Nope.  That said, the buffalo chicken dip was awesome.  Emporio was a surprise.  A meatball restaurant?  Absolute genius.  Meatballs included pork, beef, chicken, vegie and weekly special options.  Lots's of coices from pastas to paninis to bowls and large sauce and extras options.  The combinations are endless.  I had a spicy pork meatball grinder with alfredo sauce, parmesan and bacon bits at the waiter's recommendation.  Not the healthiest choice but darn good.  Half a sandwhich and I was full.  Fries are huge portions and should be shared.  I should have bought a t-shirt as they are quite amusing.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I have lived in Pittsburgh for the past year but had just heard of this place. The ambiance was perfect and the mushroom risotto at Mezzo was the best I've ever had. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"(11/10/2014)  Wanted to visit Sienna Mercato on a self-guided restaurant crawl of downtown Pittsburgh.  The tiered concept (a different restaurant on each floor) seemed so contrived.  We were there on a Monday were told that only the first floor was open.  Seems like a missed opportunity, would've spent plenty of money there.  I like a meatball just fine, but rest of the menu also not that exciting, some soup, some salad, and a pile of deep fried or buttered things.  Wouldn't call it Italian, stylistically all over the place.  Sports bar like atmosphere and loud music, and uncomfortable steel chairs also unappealing."}
{"text":"It's been a long time coming for a meatball shop with the standards of a traditional Italian meatball with a modern twist. They give you the option of having that savory ball of meat with a homemade tomato sauce but why stop there?  There are multiple combinations of sauces to choose from. My favorite being the spicy pork with a creamy Parmesan sauce over top. It is a simple concept that puts the balls in your court (never gets old). Also I recommend adding a vegetable to any of the meatballs you get. I got the tomato risotto, that was out of this world! Definitely a place to hit up if you are ever in the burgh' plus come this summer, there will be a roof top beer garden/bar to enjoy along with your meatballs! What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"We ate at the downstairs place that specializes in meatballs but has some other items on the menu as well. The meatballs, fries, Mac & cheese were all very good and tasty. Nice place and location but service and ambiance (very noisy) are what keeps this place from getting 5 stars."}
{"text":"The idea and layout of this restaurant is what makes it so interesting. There are 3 floors, bottom serves their famous meatballs, floor 2 serves additional italian meals, and the top floor is a rooftop beer garden. We chose the bottom floor and ordered meatballs. On the menu, you choose the number of meatballs, the meat type (ask what the monthly special is, you'll find an interesting new flavor), the sauce to put on the meatballs, and lastly what side they should go with. The sauces and sides range depending on your preferred taste. You can have sweet or spicy, and add traditional pasta noodles or go outside of the box with tater tots. I ordered the Loaded Baked Potato and really enjoyed it, truly a perfect comfort food. This included classic beef meat balls, white cheddar mashed potatoes, tater tots, american cheese, bacon, and scallions. While the bowl only includes 2 meat balls, I was full about 3/4 the way through my meal and took the rest to go. Meals are a bit on the pricey side for meatballs but the unique idea and atmosphere of this restaurant are worth checking it out."}
{"text":"Such a cool place! Have a meatball appetizer on the first floor, order a pizza on the second floor, and end the night with drinks at the rooftop beer garden which is open year round. I also highly recommend the braised beef pappardelle pasta. It was my favorite thing from Il Mezzo (the second floor). If you just eat at Emporio, the meatball joint, 2 sliders or a panini and a side of Mac and cheese is a perfect meal. Also try the poutine fries. So good!"}
{"text":"Im such a sucker for a rooftop bar that serves a good moscow mule.  My friends and I went here right around happy hour on a Friday and rightfully so it was crowded.  I would def suggest either getting here early to get a seat or call early for a reservation if you plan on eating.  All in all they have great drink options and the bartenders work quick enough to not keep you thirsty for too long. Great spot, but I'll be sure to check this out during week and maybe actually get a seat at the bar"}
{"text":"This is my go to when I have out of town suppliers.  I've been there with small parties (just 3 of us) and large parties (over 10).  Each and every time service has been top notch.  I suggest calling ahead if you have more than 4 people since they do have been known to have long waits during the busy times.  Each of the levels is a different experience with my two favorites being the Meatball Joint closely followed by the Beer Garden.

Let's talk balls!  They.  Are.  Fabulous.  Each month there's a new ball being featured based on the time of the year, and then there's also the regulars.  You pick your ball, your sauce, and then lastly how it is served.  From small sliders to paninis, or served over pasta you have a crazy amount of combinations to pick from.  And the parmesan fries are to die for!

I hear they also have salads and that they're good ... but let's be honest, I don't eat greens."}
{"text":"This review is only for Emporio, but I can't wait to try the other floors. 

This is the first floor and they specialize in meatballs. There are 4 different types of meatballs on the regular menu, plus a meatball of the month. You can get meatballs as sliders, grinders, paninis or just in a bowl with one of their many sauces.

I had 3 sliders and was able to try three different meatball/sauce combinations. Everything was delicious. I can't wait to go back here again to try new combinations. I absolutely loved the spicy pork with the parmesan cream sauce. I originally just ordered 2 sliders since we were splitting an order of poutine. Everything came out quickly, and it wasn't much longer when I decided to order a third slider. I want to order one of the other sandwiches sometime, but the idea of getting multiple meatball types and sauces is too good to resist so I might stick with the sliders.

We went on a Saturday for lunch around 1pm and it wasn't very crowded. I'm sure it would be busier if there was a game going on, but it was nice to be seated right away. We didn't get alcohol, but they had a good looking drink menu. Everything was really affordable and for how full I was after lunch, it was a great deal."}
{"text":"This is our new go-to restaurant downtown, and for several reasons. 

The downtown food scene has been getting more and more expensive, but Emporio, on the first floor bucks that trend, and brings the price point of a quality dinner in the Cultural District down to a reasonable level. The drinks and drafts can get expensive, but food wise, they have made it very affordable. 

The food is also nothing short of fantastic. The \"must have\" item for us is the tomato risotto, which has an amazing flavor and is portioned well enough to serve two,  even if it is a single portion in the menu. 

The waits can be rough, but they do use No Wait, though sometimes the estimated time is very misleading."}
{"text":"We were very lucky that we ended up with two prime seats at the bar during arch madness and didn't have to wait 40 mins to be seated (would have still been delic, but that's a long time to wait while you're hungry). 

The service at the bar was great. I couldn't drink and the bar tender went out of her way to make me a great virgin mocktail with grapefruit, club soda and garnishes.  

We ordered a 3 meatball turkey sandwich. It was well seasoned and filled us well (although it wasn't quite dinner).  Would go back without a doubt!"}
{"text":"If you love meatballs, you have to try this restaurant. It is one of the best restaurants in PGH & certainly downtown.

You choose your meat, sauce & how you want to eat your meatballs, e.g. Panini, in a bowl, a slider, etc. the beef and chorizo specialty were the best. I've loved the pesto and red sauce the best. 

The tomato risotto is absolutely delicious. It melts in your mouth and a side is only $5. It pairs perfectly with the meatballs with red sauce.

We also love the poutine appetizer with tater tots & gravy. Not authentic, but to die for."}
{"text":"Is hound be 3.7 for here. Had the buffalo balls and the speghetti meatballs of the month which was banana peppers. The buff was decent needs shorter Cole slaw pieces. And the meatballs were good but the speghetti was just mediocre. It's no Faustos where I'm from In Metairie. Still for late night it will do. Also tried the fat heads bumble berry which tastes like fruity pebbles it was good and also had the full pint night of the living stout. It was decent as well. So all in all not bad here but not exceptional. Late night you can't be too picky. Hot as hell here downstairs. No circulation so eating sucks when your sweating. Service was decent. So not that bad."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Meatball paninis are the bomb.  We got veggie ones and beef ones.  Both were excellent and came with a sauce to dip them in.  We got the regular fry poutine which was ok. Probably should have gotten the tator tot one.  Overall it's excellent and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm so close to giving it a 4, but I can't because their signature thing - meatballs - wasn't that amazing. I got the matzoh ball soup which was really good, tender balls, hearty broth, perfect balance of salty and doughy. Then I had the poutine with mushroom gravy and a beef meatball on top. Poutine was top notch, fresh fries, melty perfect cheese curds, and delicious gravy. However, the meatball was a little dry and didn't have much flavor. 

But the ambiance was nice and the staff was great, so I'd give it another go if I'm ever in town. Also would love to try their upstairs charcuterie."}
{"text":"At this point I have been to all three levels of Sienna Mercato on multiple occasions.  My favorite by far has been Emporio.  The beer garden is nice in the summer but it really suffers from a crap view and they tend to be short on staff.  Mezzo has good food, but the atmosphere is just not as fun.  Emporio has the fun, the beer selection, and delicious food.  I cannot comment much on the menu because I never make it past the special or the ball of the month.  They've never let me down.  Pro tip: their tater tots are a on the salty side, not too much, but a bit.  Also, feel free to have fun with the innuendos, everyone else does."}
{"text":"From the cloth napkins to to courteous manger, Will, our server Stephanie and the hostess, who was willing to step in wherever needed, spoke volumes for the service and I have yet to mention how yummy the food was.  I had the salad with a delightful chicken meatball and the chicken chili.  Delicious!  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Love heading to Mercato and ending an evening on the 3rd floor at Il Tetto with some friends.  Great drinks, beautiful rooftop, always a good time.  One of my favorite things about working in the Strip District is the close proximity to places like this."}
{"text":"Love it here. Always want to try other places when I'm out in the city, but often end up going here because I know it's delicious and reliable. The meatball panini is the perfect size with two meatballs, though you can go bigger if you're looking for leftovers! I love the mushroom gravy, personally. And the truffle fries--come on. Almost too good, and great to share. Last time I went, my mom and I split the hot fudge nut sundae with the vanilla ice cream balls and it literally was sitting in an inch of thick, hot fudge. It was beautiful. I'll be back next time I find myself in the city!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a 'cheat day', this is the place to go. I love their meatball bowls. The crack sauce is my favorite, and the tater tots are sooo good."}
{"text":"Waiters are always very helpful. We normally sit on the wine floor, pastas and entrees are delicious. I would recommend the hummus appetizer, it is very flavorful! Only complaint is the priciness, but good wine must come with good cost!"}
{"text":"Maura was a fantastic server - super friendly and attentive - made the end of our trip so perfect - give her a raise!  And this place is a staple for whenever I visit Pittsburgh and specifically when I'm downtown (likely for the Replay F/X festival).  After a long day of pinball or even in between Sienna is a great stop for their awesome meatballs!  And there's a rooftop beer garden which is sweet at night as well."}
{"text":"So, I want to give this 5 stars because it was a cool atmosphere with a great beer selection but...it just didn't deserve it.

Happened to stop in right when it opened on a Saturday--a bit after 11. They have their normal menu (no brunch or anything, which is fine with me).  Sat at the bar. Someone immediately brought us water and let us know that the bartender would be with us shortly...which she wasn't.  I don't know that it was her fault as she was prepping stuff and it's not clear that anyone told her we were there, so I'm fine with that, but still worth noting here, I guess.

Great draft beer selection and prices were not bad for a nicer restaurant; for example, a KY bourbon barrel IPA was 7.50, which is a lot, I know, BUT a few doors down (Sharp Edge or whatever it is called), that same beer is ridiculously overpriced at 10.50.  ANyway, great beer selection and friendly and informative bartender.

Got the rocket salad which was basic but good--mostly tons of arugula with some slivered almonds, three tomato wedges (not good tomatoes but it's not tomato season, but not their fault) and maybe 3 little balls of housemade mozz.  Got the Italian salad dressing and it was really good.  Ordered one turkey meatball with the salad, bc it was 2.50 (salad was $6) and I wanted to try it.  DELICIOUS!  so, wasn't blown away by the salad but liked that it was a lot of arugula and only $6 and overall well-executed.  and the meatball was great.

also ordered the 3 meatballs (original) in a grinder with the pork bolognase and provolone cheese.  It was a big sandwich--def enough to share (though I guess it all depends how much you eat).  good roll. bolognase was good but, for me, had too many diced carrots in there that were still on the too crunchy side.  others may like this...though I think even if you want that many carrots, they should have been softer. but the real issue with this, and the reason for the 3 stars, is because the meatballs were not really warm. I mean, they were at best room temp.  AT BEST. I know that it was early in the day and that they were taken out of the fridge and whatever else, but the place wasn't crowded, the sub didn't come out quickly and hello, take a few more minutes to make sure the food is warm.  a cold meatball is not good.  it just is sort of mushy and blah.  

and this wasn't just my experience...a few minutes later the guy near me (he ordered 4 meatballs--2 pork and 2 original) sent his back with the same complaint, so hopefully the kitchen got its act together after that?

So...just not really sure what was going on.  you're a meatball spot.  that's your thing.  you have got to have the meatballs not only delicious but properly heated.  

I would go back when in town, perhaps, because the turkey meatball was spot on and delicious, but was pretty disappointed with the others."}
{"text":"Great dinner after the Christmas Story musical. We had Casey as our waitress. She was awesome. Very good!!  We took her suggestions at trying the monthly meatball( thanksgiving balls bowl with turkey stuffing mash potatoes and corn). My niece had chicken meatballs withChili Mac and Cheese. Dessert was out of this world. Doughnuts w Hot Fudge. Live music and great staff. I would highly recommend the restaurant and plan to come again."}
{"text":"While I didn't sit down and eat at Sienna Mercato, I did head up the elevator and into the wonderful world they've created that seems to revolve around amazing cocktails. If you have the opportunity, take it from me -- you need to go!

The crowd can get unreal -- shoulder-to-shoulder people mingling, picking up, laughing, chatting -- and this extends tot he bar, of course. If you see your opening, take it and don't give it up until you've got what you want. A word to the wise: be polite. These 'tenders won't be messed around with, and they'll ignore you if they want to. 

While there are oodles of long tables and a few high tops, the real fun is out on the balcony where you can take int he city streets, the night life happening in the bar and the beautiful lights above. Just don't place your drinks on the railing -- there's a guy whose sole purpose is to tell you not to!"}
{"text":"I don't even eat meatballs and I loved this place. I ordered some appetizers and they were awesome. We sat at the bar on the roof and it was gorgeous! I could have stayed there all evening. I would recommend this to anyone and I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've only been to the first floor, Emporio.  I really like it.  The meatballs are great.  I've only tried the classic beef with marinara and with the bolognese sauce.  I've tried the meatball slider and the panini.  The panini was not what I would consider a panini but was my favorite of the two.  I highly recommend the tomato risotto.  It is rich and homey.  The portion is enough to share.  I have also tried the pasta fagioli.  It is a little spicy.  It was good, but not great.  I love the atmosphere.  I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place. It seems like it's consistently busy, which seems like a feat of its own given the neighborhood.

I really like the atmosphere here, especially the outdoor seating. The beer tap is solid, and most importantly, the staff is very knowledgable and resourceful when it comes to helping you make a selection. They will also let you sample their beers. 

The food was very tasty and comforting. It definitely hit the spot. I tried their special, the buffalo chicken meatball grinder. The food came out in a matter of minutes. I was impressed with the freshness of their ingredients, including their bread. The meatball itself was deliciously complex in taste and had a pleasant bit of heat.

This is a place that brings you back for more."}
{"text":"Review for Mezzo:

Really attentive, well-informed server. The atmosphere was cool and funky, but also upscale, if that makes sense. I wasn't feeling like pizza, so I ordered the small Italian cheese plate and the small bread basket (wait... isn't that basically deconstructed pizza...). Cheese plate was good with some interesting selections, but nothing too crazy or different. Came with spiced candied nuts and raisin chutney, which were both tasty and smart pairings for the cheese. Bread was amazing and came with deliciously smooth and salty butter. For the small size I thought the quantity was generous and the price fair. Two or three people could easily share either one as an appetizer or small plate.

Overall great experience and really no complaints!"}
{"text":"So I definitely was not expecting this place to fill me up  with just meatballs, but I'll be the first person to eat my own words when I say this meal not only was delicious but made my taste buds go wild all the different types of meatballs to your choice with sauce one of my new favorite spots"}
{"text":"Strolling down Penn Ave Sienna Mercado drew us in with its inviting, open-air seating.  Attitude is important, however, and the host's attitude earned 2 stars for a venue that by right should have score much higher."}
{"text":"In town for business trip and stopped off for some very highly hyped up meatballs. Got the \"ball of the month\" which was a buffalo ranch chicken over fries. Possibly one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. Pair it with an Iron City Lager and good luck getting the smile off your face!"}
{"text":"Service is not the best!  Don't sit on the far side of the bar because their dishwasher blows steam on you.  Also the bartenders don't care about you or what you want to drink"}
{"text":"Always great consistent quality - a little pricy but the atmosphere is worth it.  Service is consistently good; but I've only sat at the bar.  I love the turkey meatballs with creamy parm sauce.  32 beers on tap you can't go wrong. Yummy."}
{"text":"I'm almost full blood Italian so it's really hard to impress me when it comes to meatballs. This place isn't bad at all. It's actually quite good. I'm giving it 3 stars because I'm really hard to please when it comes to Italian food and also, their fries and Brussels sprouts were on the greasy side. But let me tell you, you won't leave this place with an empty belly. I was more than full. I got the regular meatball panini with marinara sauce and a side of fries. I also ordered the \"crack sauce\" which is ranch and hot sauce mixed and that was AWESOME! The fries were enough to feed a table of 6, not sure why that portion is so large. My coworker got a side of Brussels sprouts and those were delicious but extremely greasy and made my stomach hurt. My other coworker got tater tots and those were yummy but also very rich, would hurt my stomach, too. I think the meat balls weren't as seasoned as a real meatball should be but that's just my opinion and I'm a harsh critic when it comes to that. 

One thing, though, that makes me also put this place at a 3 is the noise level. It is so loud in this place and it doesn't help that the employees who clean the tables drag the seats across the floor - metal against cement. They literally drag them and then it sounds like they're throwing them back down onto the floor to put them in place. It made it hard to have a conversation without yelling. 

All in all, I would say yes, try this place out if you don't know what homemade Italian is."}
{"text":"The customer service was non existent. While my grandma was reviewing the menu, they explained that they were just clearing the table. My grandma was concerned being that she recently had radiation treatments to her throat that the menu was too limited. The hostess heard our conversation and asked if we would like to be removed from the waiting list. My grandma explained not to remove us. Then in about five minutes the hostess said that it was an hour wait and offered no explanation.  I've never seen anything like this interaction in my life. I was so appalled that I walked out and decided to write this review.


I also recently ate here about three weeks ago and had lovely service and excellent food. I stayed with my friends and drank on the rooftop for several hours. However, that five star experience could never outweigh the disrespect and complete lack of customer service that we experienced last night."}
{"text":"Enjoyed myself so much here. Wish the waitress didn't get my order wrong though. Got there on a Sunday afternoon before the Steelers game. Definitely thought that it would be more packed than it was but it was fine.  Downtown parking can be a bit of a headache. If you can find street parking for free on a Sunday I totally recommend it. However there is valet parking across the street. So I would with a group of 4. I ordered the saucy balls! They are huge and come with 4 meatballs. I got a side of spaghetti with it. You can choose what type of meat you want and I got 2 pork and 2 beef with Arabiatta sauce! Deeelisshuus! And very filling! 

The only downside was my waitress, after repeating my order to me, forgot 2 of my balls and only brought me two. And still charged me for the other two! And when she brought out the second 2, she didn't bring any sauce. I didn't like having to ask for my order again. 

I did get a drink, a manhattan. It was good, but a bit pricey for Pittsburgh, $14. 

Overall, I enjoyed the food, service was ehh."}
{"text":"Excellent beer choices.  I wasn't impressed by the food (all meatballs) but I like hanging out at the bar here - good atmosphere both downstairs and upstairs."}
{"text":"Pretty good, not too pricey.  While at first it seemed a bit overwhelming to go through all of the combinations of meatballs and sauces, it was easy enough to pick the meatball sandwich (with traditional beef and spicy marinara), which was by far the best thing we had.  Fun atmosphere and concept.  Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"The meatballs with their choice of sauces are KILLER!  Mixed drinks aren't too shabby, either"}
{"text":"This place has a nice rooftop bar. The food is just eh..the drinks are good and the service is great. I will return for drinks but probably not to eat."}
{"text":"We had finished watching a show at Heinz Hall and all we wanted was carbs and brews. 

The concept of a meatball joint was really neat. It was slightly overwhelming with the option of build your own, and I had a difficult time pairing type of meatball with the sauce and side. So I just went with signature bowl, Thats-spicy-Meat-a-Ball ($13). I liked the combination of the spicy pork balls with the spicy red sauce. The meatball portions were very generous and the meat wasn't tough at all considering the size of meatball. The dish was really filling taking into account that I came in famished. I wasn't a huge fan of the jalape√±os that seemed to be just tossed in there though. I also might have not paired tortellini with a thick red sauce like that. My friends on the other-hand had really good build your own bowls. The chicken meatball was slightly tough but still flavorful. So lesson learned, don't feel the need be a culinary genius when it comes to build you own, just put what you like and have fun with it, chances are you'll end up liking it anyway! 

Absolutely want to check out the roof top beer garden next time. Emporio was a fun place for a group of friends to catch up and grab a few beers!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant, I highly recommend this place. Pizza is the best, go to the second floor."}
{"text":"Very different type of Italian fare. Everything is made in-house. Different meats every night depending on what's cured and ready to be served. There are multiple ways to order your food in portions of small, medium, and large. It was a bit confusing so I ordered a pepperoni pizza and a mixed greens salad. Both were DELICIOUS!
The mixed greens had smoked arugula cheese spread around the bottom of the bowl so you'd get a taste of it each time you scooped a fork full of greens. So good!"}
{"text":"I just don't get it, I have been here multiple times since friends and colleagues seem to love it here, the meatballs are always over cooked and overpriced. Service is really nice, if not a bit too hipsterish for some, but nice people, nice atmosphere, food just isn't for me ... minus their risotto, which is pretty good"}
{"text":"Really like this place a lot. Even though it's a meatball place, absolute favorite is the warm olive appetizer with mozzarella. Wow! I can't believe I didn't think of doing that before and I've made it at home twice. 
I should explore the menu more, but I always get the poutine topped with a meatball. I've chosen different ones (spicy pork being my favorite) but can't get away from this and the olives. Fair price and great atmosphere. Lunchtime in the summer is great because if the open air seating definitely hard to come by in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Visited Mezzo yesterday for dinner. Ordered the octopus and it was very undercooked, came with white beans that were also severely undercooked, and a crumble that tasted gritty. Major disappointment. Would never order it again, and unlikely to go back."}
{"text":"I have only been here for lunch, and go about twice a month. The food is great, I never knew there were so many ways to modify a meatball - sauce, cheese, on appetizers, on salads and everything else!! 

You have to check out their meatball of the month. They had one back in March that was corned beef with sauerkraut! You don't have to wait long for the food and the service at the bar has always been very good.

They have 32 cold beers on tap and are always changing the lineup, never a bad thing!"}
{"text":"Sienna Mercato's latest creation, Mezzo, is somewhere between Emporio and Il Tetto both literally and figuratively.

On the second floor, the final installment of this saga is a blend of small plates and pizza that fills a gap between the informal meatball madness of Emporio on the first floor and the stuck up tapas of Il Tetto on the rooftop.

Service was actually exemplary for a restaurant that has been open for two days.  We were immediately greeted and I feel as if at no point, we were left out to dry (charcuterie pun).

As for food, we ordered an appetizer (mushrooms, cheese and toast), a pizza (mushroom, egg, pork, truffle etc) and pork risotto.  With the exception of the appetizer, every dish had a great level of complexity that I'd definitely come back for.  The wine list is average on price point, with the cheapest bottle of a decent red calling around $30.

The atmosphere is solid, with Sienna's outdoor theme continuing through a large set of garage doors that were open to the elements.  Lots of exposed bricks added to the scene as well.  Overall this place reminds me a lot of Butcher and the Rye.

As with Il Tetto, Emporio's incredible 1/2 off happy hour DOES NOT carry over.

Overall, I can see this joint filling a gap in our staple of restaurants, but I also probably won't actively seek it out over a few other options downtown."}
{"text":"This review is for Emporio.

I came here on a double date on a Thursday night. We arrived at 6 and the place was busy but not filled to capacity. They told us a 20-30 minute wait (which I didn't understand b/c I could clearly see 2 open tables that would have fit us) but it ended up being more like a 5-10 minute wait.

I was able to try a decent amount of menu items:
Poutine: I opted for the tater tots (you can also get regular fries) topped w/ mushroom gravy (other options were chicken gravy and any of the sauces they put on their meatballs) and cheese curds. This was a decent sized portion for $7. It was pretty tasty though on the salty side.
Pepperoni Fritters: Meh. I couldn't taste any pepperoni in these fritters which was super disappointing. Why are these named pepperoni fritters if there is ZERO pepperoni flavor. It tasted like fried cheese w/ a side of marinara.
Fried Pickles: Yummy and huge portion but you can only eat so many pickles in one sitting :P
Meatball Grinders: I got the turkey meatballs topped w/ almond pesto sauce and smoked gouda. My boyfriend got the spicy pork meatballs topped w/ creamy parmesan sauce and provolone. I thought the turkey meatballs were on the dry side and lacked flavor, and that the pork meatballs were decent but not mindblowing. There were 3 meatballs in each sandwich. The bread was bland and boring. It was a very average meatball sandwich.

My boyfriend and I also got 2 glasses of beer for him ($7.50 each) and a glass of sauvignon blanc for me ($10). Prices to be expected for a downtown restaurant.

Also, I had contemplated getting the 4 meatball option but unfortunately they don't allow mixing so you're stuck w/ 4 of the same meatballs/sauces. Sucks b/c it would be a great way to try all 4 of their meatball options. I don't think you can mix on the sandwiches either. If you want to try all 4 meatballs you would have to order 4 individual sliders which are $3.50 each.

Overall, the food was underwhelming. In all honesty, if it were closer to where I live, I may revisit...but it just isn't worth the trip to downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"An absolute favorite, never been disappointed. The food is very reasonably priced for downtown. Drinks as you'd expect. You can pretty much create your own which makes it an easy place to return back to because it's not boring. They also have a ball of the month to switch it up."}
{"text":"Simple yet effective. Very original food concept. Food tasted great, atmosphere and staff are very friendly. I definitely recommend it and will come again."}
{"text":"This is our consistent go to spot for after work and maybe a Saturday late afternoon. The servers are friendly but not intrusive; service is quick - always; and (will prob regret saying this) but we have always enjoyed consistency in the food quality and prep. The menu is basic - fresh salads, a few apps with punch, solid starchy sides, and vegetarian - turkey - ground meat or pork meatballs in addition, one wowzer meatball feature of the day. The sauce and soups are not salty. The prices are fair.  The hosts/hostesses are kind of funny the way they guard the booths - but whatever. I would not consider this a romantic place but great to relax and catch up with friends or eat by yourself."}
{"text":"This place looks like a high class barn. A little odd on the decor. First off the menu is confusing. The waitress had to explain everything a couple times. There are no descriptions of the all different sauces on the menu. We had to have the waitress describe those to us as well. 

We had a combination of saucy balls at our table. Everyone liked everything. The meatballs are a good size. If you start with an app or a salad you'd probably be okay with two balls. If you're just eating balls you'll need four. I had one slider with the Sunday gravy (basic red sauce) and the poutine on the side. I was able to eat half my fries. 

The cheesy bread is to die for and all the salads were very fresh with high quality ingredients. 

In addition to the confusing menu bringing the waitress over every three minutes, they also give you the tiniest glasses. I think everyone was in constant need of a refill. I'm pretty sure if you were there on a busy night you would not get the attention you needed from the waitress.  One last tiny peeve is that the two tables they pushed together for us were both wobbly as well as three of our six chairs. Oh and the cocktails are over priced for the size. My 4oz sloe gin fizz was $8. 

All of that said, the service great, the food was fresh and fairly priced. I'm excited to see the next two levels once their open."}
{"text":"There are definitely some things I really like about this place. I've only tried the bottom level, Emporio, but am looking forward to trying the other levels as well. Emporio's thing is meatballs. All kinds of meatballs. All kinds of ways. This is a really cool concept; however, I could see how this could get old and the menu could feel a bit limited.

The ambience is cool, with plenty of rustic elements to make it feel contemporary, yet warm and welcoming. I haven't been for dinner yet, but there are always plenty of tables at lunchtime, with or without a reservation.

There are a variety of meatball options (pork, turkey, vegetarian, beef), and there is always a special as well. You can get your meatballs saucy-style over pasta or quinoa, or another base of your choice, or you can get them in a soup (I would recommend the wedding), on a slider, in a grinder, etc. There are lots of sauce options so you can really mix things up if you like. My favorite sauces are the tzatziki, Sunday gravy, and the government cheese.  

One of my favorite things on the menu is the mac and cheese. I get it with the government cheese, but i'm sure the creamy parmesan option is delicious as well. It's really delicious, and the perfect accompaniment to the port meatball with tzatziki sauce. Yum!! The fries are really good as well, and are plenty big enough to share.

All in all, this is a great place to go for lunch before a Buccos game or a concert. Easy to get in and out, and plenty casual."}
{"text":"I love meatballs - any form, shape or size so I thought I would love this place.  It was good, it just wasn't out of this world good for a place that's all about meatballs.  

Bar area is big and had a cool vibe to it.  They have a great beer selection and if you're not in the mood for alcohol get one of their homemade cream sodas - I got the Italian one - super tasty.  

I ordered the poutine and added a classic beef meatball to it. Fries were crispy and gooey with the cheese and the meatball was good- nothing to write home about though.  I'd probably stick with the beef since the turkey meatballs my husband got were kinda dry and a bit bland.  

Ironically, the wedding soup didn't have any of those adorable tiny meatballs in it - maybe you have to pay extra for it?  

I'll probably give it another try because I love meatballs and I want them to do well so I hope they knock my meatball loving socks off when I go back."}
{"text":"Very good! A unique Italian and menu that allows you to construct your own meatball dish. The second floor does pizza and the third has an partially open-air rooftop bar. Cool place!"}
{"text":"Hi Friends,
An eclectic mix of sports bar, family restaurant and rooftop beer garden near the Pittsburgh convention center, this joint was bustling between being Kentucky Derby day, plus the Pittsburgh Marathon's 30,000 runners looking to carb load.  The menu features many, many meatballs.  But since the meatballs are delicious, and whomever wrote the menu has a great sense of humor, I'd return to this fun spot."}
{"text":"Beautiful rooftop with a pretty wide variety of beers. They update their selection often and the bartenders are always friendly and helpful in helping me choose. They're also happy to give me samples to try. It is in downtown Pittsburgh though so parking is usually tough."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant they are usually really busy so you have to get a reservation, if not it is worth the wait though."}
{"text":"I made a dinner reservation at this place and we got there on time to celebrate a friend's birthday. They didn't have a table for us and tried to stick us in between two tables. They said they were overbooked so that was that. There were a couple of empty tables near the window so I asked if we could be seated at any of those. After a lot of hawing and humming, one of the girls informed me that it was my lucky day and that I could sit at one of the window tables. I politely informed her that I had a reservation, I was on time and that I didn't need to eat at their restaurant that badly. Anyways, we were seated. The server was nice and made some good suggestions. The food was delicious and we left feeling pleased overall. I am not sure why but this is the third restaurant that I have been to where I didn't feel very welcome. I am not sure if I will go back even though I liked the food."}
{"text":"Il-Tetto is a great roof top.  One of the best in the city.  Great menu and great for a large group of people looking for an outdoor setting.  I have yet to eat or visit the first and second floors but I hear the meatballs are outstanding."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the burgh. The atmosphere is great, the beer selection is large, and you absolutely can't go wrong with the food.
I'll admit I haven't yet been to the second floor, but the other two are so good I'm not even mad. 
The meatballs from Emporio are to die for- in all of the different combinations and serving styles.
One of my family members has a severe gluten allergy and has eaten the items they list as gluten free here many times without any contamination issues. The tomato risotto is one of those gluten free items and it is soo cheesy and amazing... totally shareable portion too. 
The rooftop bar Il Tetto has a good atmosphere, big TVs, large drink selection, and really good snacks/appetizers. Sienna Mercato uses the NoWait app, which makes it easy to head upstairs for a drink or two while you wait for your table to ready! 
Will be back again soon, hopefully to try the pizza next."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Big portions and the service was great. There were 6 of us and had drinks and appetizers. I couldn't believe how low the bill was. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Treat you like it is studio  54. If you are not someone, don't expect to get on the roof on sat."}
{"text":"Love this place! There's a casual meatball restaurant downstairs, a more formal charcuterie/steakhouse upstairs and a rooftop bar all in one building. Great food, awesome ambiance. Make reservations!"}
{"text":"Great experience trying to beer garden and then eating the meatballs! Enjoyed the friendly low key service, good beer selection and then the very large meatball portions. I ordered just the meatballs with risotto. I'd come back for the risotto. But the portions are huge! I couldn't even finish half my dish! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Review for Emporio:  The wife, toddler and I went for lunch. We live very close to downtown and we're used to the parking situation but trying to find parking on the street where the restaurant is located can be a challenge to say the least. The hostess seemed pretty freaked out that we had a little kid with us, but the wait staff was professional and helpful. The food was decent , well seasoned and well prepared we ordered spaghetti for the kid and it didn't come with meatballs so we added on meatballs of each type to our meal, each had a salad and we split a panini. We ask the server if the panini was large enough to split and she stated that it was, but if you're hungry don't take advice from a thin person because the panini was barely enough for just one person. My advice is avoid the house Italian dressing unless you like a really sweet dressing that kind of ruins your salad. The atmosphere was nice we have plenty of room to eat and we will probably return to try the different restaurants on each level. This restaurant is definitely worth I try especially at lunch when it doesn't seem to be too busy."}
{"text":"The food is solid, but I don't think that I will be trying very hard to get back to this restaurant.  The first floor is meatballs, which are okay.  I prefer larger meatballs to have a smoother consistency.  Second floor is the Italian restaurant.  I liked their pizza and everything else was fine.  Third floor is for their beer garden, which a lot of people like, but for me it's too loud and crowded.  I like it more during the daytime as well."}
{"text":"My first experience was a complete disaster.  But, and I highly state that BUT, that it was Friday Happy hour.  The goal was to spend an hour or so on the rooftop beer garden then get \"in line\" for Mezzo using the app.  

The five of us spent the first 25 minutes attempting to get a bartenders attention.  Unfortunately, they were all too busy muddling stuff and concocting drinks that involved 19 ingredients to even be capable of looking up.  We were eventually able to grab a server walking by, despite the fact that there wasn't a chance of getting a seat. The server was fantastic.  However, everything went on my bill, so I had a hefty tab for two rounds that was too difficult to split.  

Our table did become available in a fair amount of time on the first floor, but there was a lack of communication among our group and someone had also requested a table on the roof.  We cancelled the table on the first floor, and grabbed the rooftop table.  However, we were not exactly clear of the limited menu.  I'm talking beef tartare, olives, rosemary and sea salt nuts, bruchetta, focaccia, and the cheese plate.  We ordered all of these, which is EVERYTHING they have to offer minus two other apps. 

I left starving, and confused.  Too many rules, too much confusion.  Never again on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I think this place is a great addition to Pittsburgh I've been here two or three times now and was introduced to it by Ted B., a Pittsburgh native --- so I knew it was going to be good, the prices are definitely justified the quality is there and there's multi levels and choices depending on what you want to do, and who you are entertaining! great addition to an amazing Pittsburgh region of culinary food and offerings! Love the people of Pittsburgh love the town love the area it's all good!"}
{"text":"I am only going to talk about 1 thing and 1 thing only.  HAPPY HOUR.  The HH is great.  No, like, super great.  Half off drafts and, rumor-is small plates on the HH menu coming soon.  

That's all I got."}
{"text":"Emporio Meatball kitchen is yet another gastronomical disappointment here in Pittsburgh. 
The chicken gravy, tater tot poutine was bland and tasteless and I think only survives by having more cheese than potatoes. 
The meatballs have a spongy texture that makes me think they are undercooked. Especially the vegetarian where it is the texture and flavor of dried out refried black beans. 
One of the sliders we got had a stale bun. It was hard as a rock and not at all toasted. 
The pork bolognese sauce tasted like chef Boyardee, but they have a government cheese sauce as well so I shouldn't be surprised by that. 
The ricotta doughnuts were ok, but bland. I could taste the powdered sugar on top, but almost nothing from the doughnut itself. 
Definitely not someplace to come back to."}
{"text":"3 levels of great food and drinks. I have been to all 3. First floor has amazing meatballs and sauces. You can create your own bowl; choose your ball, your sauce, your sides. Second floor has a full menu, with full dinner options and amazing pizzas. Third floor is a rooftop bar. I love the rooftop bar in the summer. If you're looking for some great food and drinks, and a fun evening, I would highly recommend all 3 floors!"}
{"text":"We went in last night and had the best time. Food was great, beers were cold. But the best part was Erica. She ROCKS!!!! Her service  was amazing and her attitude was awesome. We will be back because of her."}
{"text":"This place was good and had great beer, you can't lose there. How many ball jokes can you muster during your meal?! Anyways my husband got the regular meatballs in marinara on a hoagie and it was tasty. I decided to be a bit more adventurous and get the spicy balls in spicy sauce on mac a cheese. It was delicious and needless to say I ate way too much but it was so worth it. Nice crowd and ambiance in there, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Sienna Mercato. A girl friend said I should give it a shot. I'm glad she did though there are some negatives as well.

First they give you this flavored water at the table, nice mellow mood to this place too. The bar looks awesome though me and my lunch mate sat at a table. They have 32 beers on tap. 

I went with the 4 Saucy Balls. Two beef and two spicy pork. I had the house gravy on one of each and the cheesy Parmesan on the other two. The quality, taste, and service were great. Though I will say I wish the portions were larger considering the cost. The 4 balls were $12...it would have been another $4 for a pasta and lets remember this is lunch! I wasn't up for a $20 lunch even though I still spent $15 with the tip. I think you have to look at all factors when giving a review. This was a expensive lunch but I will visit again but it will have to be a occasion."}
{"text":"I'm in town on business and went here based on a recommendation from a friend (it's only been open half of a week, so that's a good sign in itself). Sat upstairs, and even as a \"lone eater\" loved the experience. Great decor, AWESOME service (thanks, Jeremy!) and the food was awesome. I got a wood-fired pizza and it was delicious, down to the crust. I'll be back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Still a cool spot but so understaffed....in my near future I see long waits and confused bartenders..."}
{"text":"No detail was missed when opening Sienna Mercato - this place is awesome. From the menu to the decor, and everything in between, the restaurant is the new place to be in Pittsburgh.

I ate veggie meatballs with the spicy tomato sauce and vegetable quinoa. I wasn't expecting the quinoa to be cold, and would have preferred it warm. Good beer selection, even though they were out of what I ordered. 

Our server was terrible and we sat at our table for a long time before we had to remind the hostess stand we were there... And the server never introduced herself or even said \"hi.\" It was a little bizarre, but I haven't heard other complaints about the service so it must have been an off night.

Can't wait for the Sienna pizza joint on the second floor..."}
{"text":"We just decided to come here because we were already super hungry and didn't wanna walk any further and they had 4 stars on Yelp so why not.

The restaurant was pretty packed on a Saturday afternoon but there was no wait at around 1PM. It was a pretty spacious restaurant, no tables squished together which I hate. 

Food was alright. As a starter we got the crab balls and they were meh, wouldn't recommend it. I got the 4 balls: spicy pork, marinara and an order of spaghetti. The pork tasted a bit weird in my opinion and I should've went for the classic beef. My parents both got the salad with one ball: mom got classic beef with mushroom gravy and dad got vegetarian with arribiatta, which he said was delicious! He was dipping almost everything dippable in that arribiatta sauce. We also got a side of parmesan broccoli, which was actually my favorite part of the meal!!

The service was just okay. Not terrible but not very attentive or welcoming/friendly.

This place reminded me of New York City's Meatball Shop but not as good. Overall, it was decent but I wouldn't come again."}
{"text":"A different idea, with different restaurants on each floor.  We stopped in on an early Sunday evening, around 5pm and got a seat on the first floor.  This floor focuses on the meatballs.  I must say, I really enjoyed the meatball dish that I had.  I went with the Chicken Meatball with a marinara sauce.  My wife went with the gyro meatball special and was quite impressed.

The staff here seems pretty disinterested in service.  Our waiter failed to ask us if we wanted desert or coffee or another drink before unceremoniously dropping off the check.  We decided to go upstairs to the top level to have a drink.  We sat ourselves and waited about 10 minutes before I decided to go up to the bar for drink menus.  No one seemed interested in seeing if I needed anything.  Since the place was fairly empty I found this to be frustrating.  After obtaining drink menus we waited another 10 minutes to see if anybody would stop by and take our order.  The two waitresses, who were waiting on the 7 total tables of people, walked by numerous times but nothing.  We ended up just walking out and leaving.  Talk about disinterested and unprofessional staff.  

Really good food, blah service.  Too many places to go to so I won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to stop by for lunch after shopping in the strip. This was our first time at this location, so we decided to get a little bit of everything. I am a sucker for Bloody Marys, so I had four... don't judge. We were seated right next to the garage door .  I didn't complain much but personally, that like there was a pretty big draft coming through and for not being crowded at all  would have liked to be seated more in the restaurant then on the outskirts . I decided to go with the Italian Wedding soup and a Caesar salad. I thought the Caesar salad was delicious. Wedding soup was good... Nothing spectacular, but still tasty. For my entree, I ordered the poutine. It was delicious and filling. My husband went with the poutine as well, but added bacon and a sunny side up egg. He also got the pork meat ball as well as the pepperoni meatball. Both were very delicious but also pretty heavy. We were unable to finish our shopping once we had this meal. But we will be back!"}
{"text":"A huge thank you to the management and staff of Sienna Mercato for being so helpful and accommodating with our group of 70 or so. We were hesitant earlier In the day when they said they could handle our group, but the hesitation turned out to be without merit. They immediately sat the majority of our group, and had the rest of us with tables within 10 minutes. The servers were on top of it, and the food came out quickly and was delicious. We also really appreciated the vegetarian and gluten free options. Management checked in multiple times with the group leaders to ensure everything was taken care of. You are all rockstars, thank you for making our group's dinner a success!"}
{"text":"Came here for a rooftop beer and was really impressed! You walk into the lower level restaurant and take an elevator upstairs. The bar has a super cool vibe. It was a chilly so it was covered, but it was glass so you could still appreciate the beautiful skyline! I will say it was a little too loud for such a chill place. Other than that it was an awesome place for some tasty beer!"}
{"text":"They changed their menu and got rid of the items that made me come here. I am very disappointed with the menu change. I wanted to leave but the other people in my party insisted we stay. In addition, the bacon cheeseburger ball of the month was gross. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"We were in town for a weekend conference, staying at the Omni; this place was within walking distance and the ratings looked good so we gave it a try.
I ordered the Saucy Balls, opting for the turkey meatballs with arrabiatta sauce, over tomato risotto.
The combination was fantastic; I could eat this same meal every day!
I also ordered a \"house daiquiri\" and our server Keeton advised that it is pretty strong, and not a typical daiquiri.
Boy oh boy was he right!
After a few sips, I advised Keeton that they should change the name of this drink to \"Sweet Baby Jesus Holy Sh**\".
Not kidding guys, this thing was STRONG.
It was not a daiquiri in any sense of the word that I have ever known, but it was good!"}
{"text":"I've experienced all three restaurants at Sienna Mercato on numerous occasions, and I am definitely a fan. Emporio (the meatball joint) is a five-star spot for me. The food is so consistently good, they have a great beer selection, a great Happy Hour, and it's pretty affordably priced. They also have Meatball Monday featuring $2 sliders. It's an amazing excuse to go there on a Monday! I really enjoy their rotating Ball of the Month - my favorite was a veal marsala that I believe they had last month.

Mezzo is kind of hit or miss. I've had good meals there, but I've also had risotto that was way underdone (Gordon Ramsay would not be pleased). The service is always good, but quite honestly I would rather eat at the less-bougie meatball level just because every experience I've had there has been so on point!

Il Tetto is a great rooftop bar. I've had a few snacks there - nothing to write home about but better than your standard bar fare. I am always impressed with the beer selection and their cocktails are delicious! This is a great place to take friends from out of town, though it does get busy on weekends.

Overall this is a solid place. Though it's been here for years and other concepts keep popping up nearby, I continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Sienna Mercata has been on my short list of places to try for some time when visiting Pittsburgh for work travel.  I stayed at the Westin on this particular visit and the restaurant was within a short walking distance, so I took full advantage!   I dined on the first floor at Emporio.  I normally frequent restaurants that use Open Table, because I hate to wait.  This restaurant was not on Open Table, but does use a Call Ahead process, and corresponding Mobile App, which was pretty cool!   I arrived based on notification from the app, and was seated immediately.  I had previewed the menu, and pretty much knew what I wanted to order.  I ordered a salad to start.  The salad was simple but tasty.  I then ordered the beef meatballs with mushroom gravy with a side of veggie Quinoa.  My entree arrive a short time later.  I love mushrooms, so I was kinda expecting actual mushrooms in the gravy, there were none.  Also, I expected the quinoa to arrive warm, it was cold dish, which was not indicated on the menu.  The meatballs were excellent, great texture and flavor.  The gravy was tasty as well, even without actual mushrooms.  The quinoa was good, but really contrasted with the warm meatballs. I couldn't eat them together, so I ended up eating the meatballs and leaving most of the quinoa.  Next time, I'll opt for a warm carb to accompany the meatballs.  I finished the meal with warm ricotta donuts.   The donuts were warm, rich and tasty.  I also requested a side of fudge sauce for dippings.....yum!   I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Many of you may be wondering about the new Mezzo floor of Sienna Mercato.  The good news is that the service is excellent and the food is delicious.  

They bring a lot of experience from their other restaurant.  For example, there's a wine I love on the Sienna Sulla menu that also is carried by Mezzo.

I had a wonderful Charcuterie and Cheese Board that was great for splitting for 2 or 3 people.  The Pizza is cooked in an authentic wood fired oven, and the choices are creative.  

For dessert we split the Gianduja Tartufo, which was a tasty way to finish our meal.  

One reason the staff was so well trained is they came from one of the other Sienna restaurants.  All in all, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch with 6 others including 2 children. We started with the pepperoni fritters which were okay.  Several people at the table ordered salads and they were a nice size and the home made dressing was excellent.  I had 2  beef meatball sliders, one with marinara and one with creamy parmesean sauce. Both were good, but could have used a bit more sauce. The mac and cheese with government cheese was a hit with the adults and kids. Everyone enjoyed their meal, and the service was great.  I would definitely recommend this for lunch or if you have no kids...happy hour/night out as they have a large draft selection."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place from friends and was excited to finally go. We went to the 3rd floor for some drinks during the arts festivals. You have to wait in a line to take an elevator up which kinda took a while but there were servers coming around asking us if we wanted a beer while we waited so that was nice. The bar outside was awesome. The bartender made a dynamite Tom Collins for my fianc√© and I love the old fashioned he made me. Good friendly service. I would highly recommend it to others for a drink but if you want to sit down and eat you definitely have to get there early or be willing to wait."}
{"text":"Stopped in with several business colleagues for lunch. The place was packed, but thankfully we had made reservations and were quickly attended to. 

The place is really just a meatball joint that offers a variety of meats to choose from and then some really good appetizers/finger foods, fries, and salads. The portion sizes are more than adequate, too...and the prices are pretty reasonable for downtown eating. 

Not to forget, the place does have a great \"feel\" to it with the open-wall style seating so you can watch the passers-by.  I'd definitely be interested to try the rooftop bar on a great weather night. 

3.5 stars, but giving it a little bump to 4 since it's above 3 stars, for sure.  Looking forward to my next time back...cheers!"}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 10 people on a Saturday night, ended up being an hour-ish wait after we decided to split onto 2 tables of 5. Our group of five ended up ordering each kind of meatball (minus the vegetarian because who would go for that if they buy a meaty dish?) along with two poutines (house cut fries and tater tots) and a crab balls appetizer. As for the meatballs, I found them to be alright. Was originally intrigued by the concept of it, but to be honest I found it slightly overrated in reality. My classic beef meatballs ended up being a little on the dry side ... I would have appreciated it if it was a little more tender. My favorite kind of meatball ended up being the spicy pork one ... not only tender enough to be minimally satisfying, but I did like the spicy kick since it definitely added to what would otherwise be pretty standard tasting meatballs. As for the sauce choices that you can get with the meatballs themselves ... my favorite would probably be the marinara. I found the arribiatta to be a little too salty and the spiciness (although I found it not to be that spicy at all) only exacerbated the saltiness of the sauce. As for the poutines, the tater tots with the cheese curds and gravy were delicious. Mozzarella cheese was perfectly melted (not too cold or squishy) and the tater tots along with the gravy and cheese made for a wonderful blend of taste in each bite with the cheese helping to moderate the saltiness of the dish. The fries were your standard fare of fries. As for the crab balls appetizer, I found them to be just average. Overall ... it was okay. I'm not really sold on the meatballs as the main course ... it left a little something more to be desired. They do have two other levels though ... the second floor for meat charcuterie and the third being a rooftop beer garden."}
{"text":"I went to the second floor when I came here (Mezzo) to get pizza. I had the Duck Speck pizza and it was great. I found it to be a tad salty, but i notice that more than the average person. I couldn't finish the entire the pizza, so it's possible to split one if you're not starving. My drink was really good too; I believe I had the Mezzorita. And I must add the service was excellent, as well. 

This is a great spot downtown and the fact that there's a rooftop bar above it makes it all the better."}
{"text":"My first night in Pittsburgh found me on Penn Ave at this fine establishment. It was an interesting concept that in a way combined three restaurants into one via different floors. I dined at the meatball joint on the main floor and it was a treat indeed. I had the spicy pork meatballs which were great and I would highly recommend. The drink menu was tantalizing and is worth checking out as well."}
{"text":"The pickle appetizer is incredible!  It is worth the trip just for them!  Very thinly sliced sweet pickles, flash fried, with a bacon dipping sauce. Delicious.
Enjoyed the meatballs and sauce combinations. A fun (but noisy) place to eat. Definitely will return for more pickles!"}
{"text":"I gave this place 2 chances before deciding to write a review... Overall it is a great concept: who doesn't love a good meatball!?  That, in my opinion, is where the excitement ends.  Upon walking into the restaurant, it took 4 people behind the hostess stand almost 30 seconds to acknowledge that we were standing there -- One of whom I can only assume is a manager due to his more professional attire (I'll get back to that later).  We were seated and given water (for some reason they won't fill your glass up the entire way which is probably not a big deal for some people, but it's just odd. Oh, and be prepared to ask for ice).

Once we were seated, we told our waitress we were waiting for 2 more people but that we would look at the menus in the time being.  She stopped back for our drink orders shortly after. At this point, we heard from the other 2 in our party that they would not be eating, just drinking, and to go ahead and order without them.  We did, and we let our waitress know that the other two would be coming shortly.  

Our first item, the tater tot poutine, came out quickly and was SO good. I would go back just for that!  Shortly after, our 2 other friends arrived.  The waitress made NUMEROUS trips past our table without acknowledging them, asking how our food was, etc.  She finally stopped back for their drink orders.  The rest of the dinner was fairly uneventful but we did notice that all the other tables seated after us received their food before we did -- and we were only waiting on 4 meatballs.

Back to the attire I mentioned earlier.  When you walk into this place, its decorated extremely well -- at least for my taste -- and I would consider it a cute date night spot downtown.  However, the servers' \"uniforms\" are less than cute and really take away from the whole atmosphere.  Cutoff jean shorts, jean skirts, T-shirts, cowboy boots, hats... pretty much whatever they wanted to wear, as long as they had a restaurant t-shirt on.  The gentleman at the hostess stand was dressed well as was another young gal who seemed to be in charge of seating guests, so perhaps she was a manager as well.

If this place wants to keep up with the Jonses (aka Sonoma Grille, Ten Penny, etc.) they really need to take a step back and look at the overall picture. 

The food is phenomenal but I just can't get over the servers and what seemed to be a general lack of care for their personal appearance."}
{"text":"My review is strictly for drinks.

This place is usually crowded, as it has arguably the best rooftop in the Burgh. It's an awesome concept- there are three floors and each floor has a different menu. I never ordered food here, but would love to do so in the future. We came here for a friend's birthday and sat on the rooftop. It was a gorgeous night, making it the perfect spot to be. It was really crowded, and I think that's the norm here- so be prepared. They had a decent selection of beers, so I tried a few local brews I haven't had before. Their prices were normal for downtown, meaning a little more expensive than what you might find in south side or surrounding areas. Overall, we had a great time. I hope to return to check out their huge meatballs!"}
{"text":"This review is for the bar on the third floor. What a fantastic ambiance. There is a sliding roof that opens and also has heaters if it's too cold outside. All of the Tables have Reserved signs on them but it has been pretty easy to sit at the bar both times I've been here. It is really cute and would suggest coming here to at least have one drink"}
{"text":"Came here with the fiance for a nice dinner out. We decided on Emporio as we both had been dying to try the famous meatballs and sauces. This time I was smart about my my wait and used the No Wait app on my phone to get us checked in. Once we arrived at Emporio we still had about a 35 minute wait, so we headed up to the beer garden and had some drinks, it was fairly quick half hour! Be sure you are timing this place right on any given weekend and put yourself in line long before you leave the house, it really was much better than my last experience with Mezzo. 

For dinner we went all out! We started with the pepperoni and cheese bites with house marinara for dipping. These were delish! Fried crispy on the outside and the inside was creamy with little bits of pepperoni chunks! SO GOOD. Then we each had a wedge salad with bleu cheese dressing. I was surprised how big the salad was! I couldn't even finish mine it was so huge. The dressing was just OK, but did have nice chunks of bleu in it. For dinner, fiance had the \"Saucy Balls\" - 4 basic beef meatballs with house marinara and spaghetti and I had the Meatball sub combination: 3 beef meatballs with gouda cheese and marinara. The meatballs themselves had really good flavor and my sub was just OK...the marinara was almost TOO acidic in some weird way, and the bread was nothing special at all.  I am never a person who gets heartburn, but that sauce really did me in. It has a very acidic tomato taste. I guess I prefer my marinara with a little more body and just a bit of sweetness to offset all of that acid. Overall it was pretty good, but the sub was slightly underwhelming. However, the government cheese mac and cheese as a side.....OH MY GOD. This made up for every shortcoming of the meatball sub. Ditalini pasta and the most CREAMY and velvety cheese sauce....it was out of control amazing. I will absolutely be getting that again. 

Overall it was a pretty good meal and our waitress so nice and attentive and brought our food out quickly. She was one of the best waitresses I have had in quite some time and really made our dinner experience great. 

I will definitely be back for more of these sauce and meatball combos...I want to branch out beyond the marinara next time! Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"For a place that completely dedicates itself to meatballs I feel they should be of better quality.  I tried the meatball grinder, and although the size and price were great the meatballs them self lacked any distinctive flavor.  They weren't  juicy enough and lacked moistness, honestly just average.  It would be tough for me to justify a visit back when I have had better of their only item at italian restaurants nearby.  The crab balls were a nice special."}
{"text":"Place is a true gem. Three levels, three restaurants and three different vibes. Upstairs is a huge bar with an outside rooftop patio to enjoy the night. The bar was packed and well staffed, and the drinks were solid. The bottom floor is the meatball joint...and let me say IT WAS GREAT. You can build your own meatball dish. I took a chance and had the waitress bring me whatever she thought I would like...she did not disappoint. This place is not only worth it, it is a must do while in the city."}
{"text":"They have both a standard and rotating menu.  The rotation is the meatball of the month with the recommended sides.  I usually try the flavor of the month as they are unexpected and always very good.  Also, try the buffalo chicken meatball appetizer."}
{"text":"The ROOF! If anyone is visiting from out of town, I make sure to take them to dinner and drinks here. I would recommend a mini drink and appetizer bar crawl (you don't even have to walk outside!) starting with Mezzo and ending on the 3rd floor roof top bar. Definitely recommend making a reservation though, it's always busy."}
{"text":"How does one take a mundane thing such as a meatballs and turn it into a masterpiece of culinary chef d'oeuvre. Taking a dish, that most of us have extensive exposure to and flip our preconceived perceptions of the lowly maligned meatball. They elevate this stalwart of many a dish from supporting cast to the bell of the ball!
I know what you must be thinking how could a meatball shop be \"trendy\" or \"classy\". Well all you have to do is step through the doors of this new shop and you will not only see but know the answer.
This new gem on the street of cuisine is an amazing addition to the fare available. This former piano gallery has transformed into a fun filled establishment buzzing with life and full of verve. When you first walk in the dark wood and metal create a warm, cozy, yet upscale feel. You are greeted at the door with smiles and welcomed to the fun. 
There are no reservations needed so there can be a wait but Mercato is part of the modern trend of restaurants that utilize your smart phone to help with the wait. So download for free the app NoWait and you can check in before arriving so you are already in line plus if they don't show on the list there is ... no wait!
Once you are seated the servers all have been absolutely incredible. We have had the distinct privilege of being served by Nick twice now who elevated our experience from great to truly don't miss out! The servers have fun with the names of the dishes on the list and yes you can easily get a bit irreverent and borderline inappropriate with the play on ordering \"saucy balls\" and \"grinders\". Additionally the drinks are based on a bit of a throwback so nothing overly fancy or crazy names just good drinks to accompany GREAT food!
Not often can I say this about a restaurant but nothing on the menu is substandard it's all good! From the poutine which when ordered with mushroom gravy and an egg on top is as close as you'll get to an order of this awesomeness in Toronto. The beef, pork, chicken, and specialty balls are all amazing and not one of the myriad of sauces are wonderfully crafted and superbly delicious. The menu is uncomplicated and easily perused but because of how incredible everything is it rapidly descends into the depths of your own disappointment as you only have enough space in your own belly to fit so much. 
With the promise of two more floors being nearly completed for the summer, the quality, care, and flavors that their food delivers on I am waiting with baited breath and salivating incisors at the fine food these additions will unveil to the world of Pittsburgh. In other more simple terms...... What are you waiting for (besides a table) get down to Penn Ave and have your mind and taste buds blown away by those saucy balls at Sienna Mercato Emporio. You'll leave with a new found respect for the simple yet majestically masterful meatball and all this little leviathan will bring to your palate. Oh yeah all of this for a reasonable cost ta-boot!!! Thank you Nick from Nicholas Coffee for a wonderfully amazing addition to the street of cuisine may all your future endeavors be as incredible as this!!"}
{"text":"This is only for the meatball level.  I had been really looking forward to trying this place and left with just a \"meh\" feeling, and one that I don't expect to experience again. 

I had gone with some out of town vegetarian friends knowing that their menu was full of veggie-goodness.  I was there more for the meat.  

I started with an Italian cream soda in blueberry that had a bit of an odd flavor to it.  It might have been the cream, it might have been the syrup, not really sure, but it was just a bit off. 

Then I had the turkey ball with the pesto and the spicy pork with arrabiatta.  Now, I like spicy things - I am generally a 7 on an Asian scale of spicy, but this ball and sauce literally made my nose run.  Hot, just for the sake of hot, is never appealing.  The pesto left a lot to be desired as well.  And the turkey ball was dry and rather flavorless.  I always buy turkey meatballs at Whole Foods which are delicious and these did not at all compare.  I also order the beans and greens which were good, but super soupy and kind of should have been served with a spoon. 

The friends that ate the veggie balls said it was really just a white bean ball and rather flavorless.  

If you are a meatball place, you should make meatballs - the best meatballs ever.  These were not nearly as good as my mom's or Whole Foods which was disappointing."}
{"text":"Sienna Mercato is a restaurant in a three-story building with a different dining concept on each level. During my trip to a conference in downtown Pittsburgh, only the first level, Emporio, was completed and open for business. 
Emporio's concept is gourmet meatballs and I'm usually the last person to order meatballs because they are usually lacking taste and come with the standard marinara sauce. When this place popped up on my restaurant search, I was actually excited to see something other than the standard meatball on the menu.  I tried this place and liked it so much the first time that I went for a second trip.  I was pleasantly surprised to see a vegetarian \"meatball\" on the menu as well which had a good taste and flavor. You can add a meatball to a salad or a soup or you can order one of their meatball sandwich options with your choice of sauce. If that's not enough, they also have a great variety of side dishes that you can add to your meal. The only issue was the slow service on both visits but this place made enough of an impression that I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I called in last night to order some food to go.  This was my first time eating food from here.

I give the food a 7/8 out of 10.  I had \"Saucy Balls\" (4 meatballs in sauce) and a wedge salad.  

It's apparently impossible to get 2 pork meatballs and 2 beef meatballs.  This is unfortunate because it doesn't let me try a wider variety of your food and also because it's unbelievably easy to accommodate.  I should be able to get 4 different kinds of meatballs if I want.  Seriously?

I didn't eat in the restaurant but it seemed to be having the usual identity crisis that most Pittsburgh restaurants and bars have.  Half upscale, half sports bar.  Nice decor, ESPN on a TV.  Make a choice and stick with it.

My comparisons were easy to make because there's a meatball only restaurant in my town (24th & Meatballs) that does a much better job and has been doing it for longer (i.e. I'm sure this place is probably a rip off).  I have no problem with that but a 2nd generation restaurant has every opportunity to do it better.

I'll give it one more shot.  I'll have to just so I can try a different flavor of meatball."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Friday night with my wife and another couple for dinner.  Since we couldn't make reservations, my wife and I arrived right around 6 PM with the hopes that we would be able to a get a table at around 7 which is when the other couple was scheduled to meet us.  Thankfully the hostess was able to help us.  She took down my phone number and put us in the system for 7 while telling us that we could go upstairs to have a drink.  We did just that by walking down the stairs and then taking the elevator up to the rooftop beer garden.  At just before 7 I received a text message to my phone saying that my table was ready. Unfortunately the set up here is not that great if you are waiting for a table at Mezzo in the beer garden.  First you have to wait for the slow elevator to take you down from the roof and the kicker here is that it won't stop at the second floor even if you press the button.  So then you have to go down to the first floor in order to walk back up to the second floor even though there is clearly a place you could exit the elevator on the second floor.  Anyways, the inside of Mezzo is decorated pretty nicely.  It has some exposed brick walls with painted on graphics, a bar and seating for probably around 40 people or so.  We were sat in one of the corners of the restaurant at a booth with a view overlooking Penn Ave.  What was cool was that it looked like in warmer weather that the second floor windows could be opened up.

For dinner our table decided to start off the evening with the large Charcuturie platter as well as a large bread basket.  Both the charcuterie platter and the bread basket were brought out at the same time and each was explained by a different staff member.  The bread basket ended up having three pieces of three different kinds of breads and came with sides of a honey butter and a peppernota.  I can't remember all three types of breads but I do know that the cheese one (maybe a pecorino) was the best and that I also enjoyed the slightly spicy peppernota on it.  As for the charcuterie platter, WOW!  There were about 10 different kinds off meats as well as some crostinis, pickled onions and a cherry dipping sauce.  I don't think that there was a single thing on it that I didn't enjoy although my favorite meats were probably the Sopresetta and prosciutto.  I also really enjoyed the pickled onions and cherry sauce.  After we finally finished almost all of our appetizers our entrees came out.  My wife and I ordered the seafood risotto and also the tartufo pizza with the intention of sharing them with each other.  The seafood risotto was pretty good with many pieces of both octopus and squid in it as well as a few shrimp.  However, I still preferred the pizza and its mushrooms and cheeses.  There was an ever present smell of truffle on the pizza which was nice and the ricotta and fontina made a nice backdrop for it.  With the amount of food that we had consumed from the  appetizers we were not able to finish either entree and had about half of each to take home.  That didn't stop us from ordering dessert though and we ended up going with a blood orange custard like dessert where the custard was served frozen.  While I wasn't getting too much of the blood oranges flavors from it I did think that it tasted like a creamsicle and enjoyed both the taste and the interesting texture of it.

The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  I really enjoyed the charcuterie platter and all of the other food was good as well!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to report that my experience at Sienna Mercato (Mezzo) was disappointing. I'm usually in agreement with Yelp ratings (those that have many reviews), but my experience last night was not a four star experience. 

First, I have to say that the service was good. Our first server left, but a co-worker took over his tables and she was super nice. My boyfriend and I ordered a Lamb Sugo (which had paccheri, a tube shaped pasta similar to rigatoni) and a Tartufo pizza to share. The pizza had ricotta and other cheeses, mushrooms, truffle, and chives on it, but was so bland. I rarely add salt or additional seasoning to food at restaurants, but we had to ask for salt and pepper because this pizza was not flavorful at all. The server asked if al dente was ok for the pasta and I said yes. However, the pasta that came out to us was way undercooked. It was hard to cut into and you could see the white in the middle that wasn't cooked. We had to send it back. I really don't like sending food back, but we couldn't eat it as it was. Even though the second Lamb Sugo they brought out was ok, the best thing we ate was actually taking the bland pizza and throwing some of the pasta sauce with lamb on it. Weird, but it was good pizza crust and the sauce was flavorful, so combining the two was better than eating each by itself. We also got a tiramisu to share, and while it was scrumptious, the portion was tiny. I think we both got about three bites. The other food was well portioned; it's too bad the best part of the meal wasn't. 

The ambiance of the place is great. I love the lighting and casual yet classy vibe. I just expect a lot more from a place that got such rave reviews. (One note is that a lot of the rave reviews are for the meatballs, so it's possible that I need to go back to Sienna Mercato but hit up the Emporio section.)"}
{"text":"Bullshit place. A nightmare. Horrible food, horrible service. Never come here if you want to have an OK time. My friends and I went to get a drink at the bar while we waited for a table. Bar service was horrible, waited forever to be served. Once we finally told our table was ready, we were told they were just cleaning it off, waited another 29 minutes and then asked again and were told we were waiting because people has their elbows on the table... OK. I got Bruchetta which should be called tomatoes on toast. I walked down the stairs to have a smoke and came back up the stairs, which I guess is not allowed, although I had a seat at a table and had been there for a while to be met by a bouncer and the horrible hostess who yelled at me and told me to leave. She was so rude, threatened to call the police on me. I did nothing illegal and was not rude, initially. I can't believe this happened!"}
{"text":"I paid Mezzo, the middle level of Sienna Mercato, a visit this past weekend, when my friends and I were downtown to see the PGH Opera at the Benedum.  Given that Mezzo just opened a month or so ago, that it made the Post Gazette's most recent list of notable new restaurants, and that I greatly enjoyed my experience at Emporio downstairs, I was eager to try this trendy new addition to the Cultural District dining scene.

We started off with an order of the bruschetta del giorno, which had the following toppings the day of our visit: white bean paste, roasted red peppers, and anchovies.  While the anchovies added a welcome savory note to the bruschetta, overall, I found it rather bland in flavor (my friends concurred).  Fortunately, the food quality went up from there.  We ordered two pizzas to share between the three of us: the margherita for something more traditional, and the pistachio-prosciutto, which came with roasted crimini mushrooms, fennel pollen, and vinagrette-tossed arugula, for something more avant-garde.  The latter pie had a very interesting, complex, and fragrant flavor profile, and was quite nutty due to the pistachio butter that acted as a sauce--almost overly so.  I found it similar in composition to the fig-goat cheese pizza offered at The Porch in Oakland, which I prefer due to its bolder flavor and sweet-savory balance.  The margherita was my surprise favorite--I found it the best version of this pie that I've tried in PGH to date, due to its savory, well-seasoned sauce, fresh mozzarella, and its significant but not overwhelming infusion of basil.  The crust of both pies was more pan-style than thin, and was crispy and substantial.  The bocce cookies provided with the check were also chocolatey, gooey, and delicious, and were a nice touch.

Aside from the food, we really enjoyed the atmosphere, which, as others have mentioned, is a bit more refined than Emporio (I can't speak for Il Tetto, since I haven't visited yet), but carries through the farmhouse theme.  Even the tunes, an eclectic mix of upbeat songs from the 70's and 80's, added to it.  As for the service, it was impeccable--the best I've encountered to date in a restaurant of this caliber to date. Our waiter, Cory, was very knowledgeable about the food, as well as appropriate wines to pair with it.  Someone even came over and refolded my friends' napkins while they were in the bathroom--wow!  Overall, I'd recommend Mezzo for a high-quality, casual, and reasonably-priced dinner downtown.

***Note: Please also see my separate review for Emporio, for which this review is listed as an update.***"}
{"text":"What a cool place to hang out.

First thing to know is there are 3 floors. 
1st Floor, is a meatball and snack joint.
2nd Floor is a separate restaurant with high end dinners and pizza.
3rd Floor is an open sky bar with snacks and special meals like a pig roast.

I didn't know about the other 2 floors. I ordered some meatballs and spaghetti on the 1st floor. You can build your own meatballs.  I got the arriabta sauce which is marinara sauce with a kick. It was good but I wanted more garlic and Italian seasoning in the sauce and meatballs. The spaghetti was the same.
I also ordered their fried donuts with ricotta cheese inside that you can dip in chocolate which were good.

The two floors upstairs are even more fun and have hotter people in them! A must visit during the warmer months!"}
{"text":"What can I add to what's already been said?  Three levels, three concepts, all well executed.  My favorite is the street level Emporio, which features an extensive drink menu and even more impressive balls.  Yeah, I said balls and not meatballs.  They're not all made of meat!  There's always at least one or two non-traditional meat variety offered, which is nice for my vegetarian friend, or for me when I happened to come here on a Lenten Friday.  I appreciate that you can mix and match so much with a fairly limited menu.  As for the other two levels, Mezzo and Il Tetto, they are fine establishments as well.  Mezzo is better for a sit down dinner/date, and Il Tetto is a popular spot for the local working stiffs who want to breathe some life into downtown Pittsburgh after 5pm.  I wish I could mix the rooftop garden setting with the Emporio menu, but alas, never the twain shall meet.  And that goes for the middle too.  So, if you were hoping to mix and match, you're out of luck.  However, you can always make a \"progressive\" out of it and wander from floor to floor.  Advance line placement via the No Wait app is recommended on weekends, because they don't do reservations."}
{"text":"My friend was just telling me about this place the day before so I had to come here. I'll get straight to the point. I got the 4-meatball deal (turkey) then put it all over macaroni & cheese with pesto. Awesome! The food was SO filling and so delicious. I was skeptical of being full, but I sure was! All for $15.00 as well. I would definitely come here again!

Now, for upstairs! Who doesn't love a good freaking rooftop?! I sure do! The roof is actually retractable so if it's cold, raining or anything else, the glass roof can close. Luckily, it was a nice night out so we were able to enjoy the roof open. Drinks were good, moderate in price, but I absolutely loved the atmosphere and I would come here often just to chill."}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals! I didn't eat but my friends we obsessed with the meatball sandwiches. Also the rooftop bar is amazing, very pretty with all the lights and a view of all the buildings!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times and the food has been consistently good.  My most recent trip the service at the table was awful but the bartender, Alaina, was fantastic.  Friendly, attentive, and makes a great Bloody Mary.  

The menu is simple and good for the soul.  The concept is simple- pick a meatball type (vegetarian options available too), pick a sauce, then the type of dish.  I've had a meatball as a slider and I've also had an Italian sausage ball on a dish of Mac and cheese.  None have disappointed.  There is also a fantastic poutine fries available that my friends have raved about. 

I need to make it up the steps for the rooftop beer garden pronto.  I will be back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Can a vegetarian enjoy a joint that specializes in meatballs? The answer is yes. The restaurant provides a vegetarian largely bean based meatball and plenty of vegetarian friendly sauces to go with it that are marked as vegetarian so you can be clear. You can get it in a traditional sandwich type way or have it with their extensive sides such as mac and cheese, penne, risotto, or a quinoa. I had mine with the pesto almond sauce and Gouda cheese. Very delicious. The parmesan fries are really delicious as well served with an awesome aioli dip. 

Sierra Mercato is three levels technically. The top floor is a rooftop bar type setting filled with unwinding young professionals for the most part. It is quite nice, but does not have the same menu as downstairs. The wait time is usually pretty long. My recommendation is to have a drink on the rooftop from the bar and use the Nowait App to get a seat downstairs and enjoy their delicious food that is not available upstairs. They do have small plates upstairs though. 2nd floor bar/restaurant is not open yet. Oh and PS, the prices are pretty reasonable considering the cultural district location and \"nice\" ambiance."}
{"text":"We stayed across the street at the Courtyard and stopped in for a drink.  This place has three floors including a roof top bar... great fun.  We sat at the bar on the first floor and had one of the many beer choices on tap.  Also, order the bruschetta!!! Fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here dozens of times and keep coming back for food and drink. Just realized I hadn't done a review yet. You will get good service whether you are in the restaurant, sitting at the bar, or on the rooftop. The meatballs are perfect for a small bite or a big hoagie. All spots at the bar on the ground floor or on the rooftop have a good view of whatever big game is playing."}
{"text":"Emporio is my go to place when I'm downtown now.  It seems to please everyone I'm with.

The meatballs are great.  I usually get 3 sliders.  I like variety.  The meatballs and sauces are too good to get a hoagie with only one style of meat or sauce.

They have the standard large draft beer selection and a nice wine selection."}
{"text":"I had high expectations, but was extremely disappointed.  I called at 6:15pm to get a party of 8 on the \"wait list\" and was told the wait would be approx. one and half hours. We headed up to the Beer Garden on the third floor.  This was the one positive aspect of our experience.  The Beer Garden is a cool atmosphere, good selection of draft beers and wines.  After waiting nearly THREE hours we were texted that our table was ready.  We headed downstairs to wait, and one of the guys in our party  stepped out to smoke.  As he came back in he bumped the door and the host called a security guard over.  The host claimed he slammed the door, and they would not allow him back in to eat dinner with us.  This was not a young drunk 21 year old, but a middle aged father of three that had 4 beers in the \"Beer Garden.\"  This is completely uncalled for and ridiculous after we waited for three hours.  Six of us ended up eating on the second floor.  Where the service was not good, the selection of drafts is minimal, and the food is average at best.  I had a traditional pizza, which was terrible.  The pizza sauce tastes store bought and the crust was bland and not very soft.  My husband had the half-chicken dinner dish which was tasty, but not worth waiting three hours for.  This was mostly likely our first and last time there.  My suggestion is go there early have a few drinks in the Beer Garden and then go somewhere else to get yourself a good meal."}
{"text":"My brother recommended we go here when I was in town visiting. When he said it was a meatball place in Pittsburgh I have to admit I was skeptical. To my surprise it is a very trendy place with good prices, service,drinks, and the food is so much more than \"just meatballs.\" The pepperoni fritters were amazing, and I had the Italian salad with a turkey and vegetarian ball which was equally as good. I hadThe \"emporio\" or meatball joint and main restaurant is on the first floor. We didn't explore the second floor which is a wine and pizza bar, but we did go to mezzo on the roof. Amazing view and really cool bar. If you're downtown this is definitely a place that can please everyone!"}
{"text":"I'm not a meatball fan, but I loved Sienna Mercato's. A little on the pricier side, but still affordable."}
{"text":"Interesting and novel restaurant.  The entire menu is based around meatballs. The staff was friendly and personable. The service was quick the food was pretty tasty too! If I ever come back to Pittsburgh, I'll hit this place up again."}
{"text":"I dined on the Mezzo floor of Sienna Mercato (second floor). This place features wine, charcuterie, and pizza. We had a reservation for 5 pm; however for the first 30 minutes of our meal we had essentially the entire place to ourselves. We had a seat right against the window and it was a beautiful location. 

We started with the small charcuterie plate and the small artisanal cheese platter. I highly suggest getting both of these together. We split this appetizer between the two of us, but it could provide a little taste for up to four people. We paired this with a glass of primitivo which apparently is made from the same grape as the red zinfandel. This wine was great once it had some time to breathe. 

For dinner we split the Tartufo pizza which has ricotta, fontina, roasted mushrooms, truffle, parmesean, farm egg, and chives. This pizza was so delicious. It is split into 6 pieces and we almost finished the whole thing between the two of us. The mushrooms are very meaty and the hint of truffle really adds another level to this pizza. Unfortunately, we were unable to have dessert because we had a show to catch; but our server gave us complimentary coconut cookies to go.

Our service was superb. The server really knew how to sell the menu and create combinations that customers will enjoy. He was very attentive but not too overwhelming. In addition, they didn't start our pizza until after our appetizer was finished which was wonderful. the pizza was fresh from the oven! Our entire experience came in at $65 which was a great value. I think two appetizers, dinner, and wine for that price is worth it. 

I can't wait to come back sometime soon and try their other cheese plate!!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to take out of town friends and family and that's just what we did! We brought my in-laws and some friends here for dinner before checking out the Christmas market in Market Square. You can get away with a great meal without having to spend a lot, which I appreciate! I got the poutine with meatball on top and it was delicious."}
{"text":"We were on a vacation stopover and found this spot. We had wonderfully attentive service despite them being PACKED. It was kid-friendly, but also had a good beer selection for the grownups.

We stuck with the meatballs in marinara sauce and they were delicious. In a bowl or as a sandwich. Yum. There were lots of options of meatballs and sauces if you want to try something a little different. Next time we are passing through I will want to stop there for sure."}
{"text":"Waiting for a drink at the beer garden on the rooftop bar and it has been 22 minutes and counting for the drink to arrive. I love sienna mercato and all of the food there. But this was so ridiculous. Hopefully this place will get better."}
{"text":"Is it wrong to be in love with a restaurant? If SM were a person, I'm sure he would be my soul mate. I stopped here a while back on a Saturday mid afternoon for a late lunch. When I walked in, I immediately knew this was my type of place. Modern, casual and chic. The decor reminds me of what would be at a classy backyard bbq. From the combination of stainless steel and glassware to the exposed brick SM will make anyone feel welcome and at ease. And I do mean anyone. Bring the kids, bring grandma, everyone will love it. Now onto the food.

We tried several of the saucy balls. You can order individual balls with different sauces to try out as many combos ad you'd like. And at 3 bucks a ball, you can't go wrong. My favorite was the pork with the arribiata sauce, a yummy and slightly spicy red sauce. I also really enjoyed the garlic parm fries. Think chicken wing but on fresh cut fries. The menu has so much to offer (even vegetarian balls!) and at such reasonable prices, you'll want to bring the family every week. Which brings me to my one and only issue with SM, the location. Despite my love of SM, I doubt I will be back as often as I would l like. Having to find parking downtown, pay and walk a couple blocks to just to get to the restaurant is a large negative for south hillers like me. I wonder if others will feel the same? Hopefully a neighborhood location will be in the works sometime soon."}
{"text":"Some nice drinks and beautiful patio space. Food is decent as well. Would return. Wasn't a big wait time either to get a table for a relatively large party."}
{"text":"Based on our personal experience, here are a few tips on how NOT to get verbally abused at Sienna Mercato:

- DO NOT USE MORE CHAIRS THAN THAT ALLOTED TO YOUR PARTY
o You may unapologetically be berated just loud and dramatic enough for everyone to stare at you in horror (GM, Chris Clark, was kind enough to put on this performance for our party)
- DO NOT STEP MORE THAN 2 IN. AWAY FROM WALL WHILST IN LINE FOR ELEVATOR
o You may be physically pushed (female, or not) if you step out of line
o Member of staff may not hesitate to demean and degrade you with terribly inappropriate language
(Jarvis... here's to you.)

If you're still interested, try the tater tots. They're actually pretty good. But don't even bother getting a drink upstairs... if you haven't noticed yet. The service sucks."}
{"text":"Less than inspiring.  Terrible treatment from the bouncer who was particularly rude and hostile with my family.  Also flat beer."}
{"text":"Sienna Mercato was on my list of restaurants to try in Pittsburgh. For a belated Fathers Day celebration, we went to Emporio, the \"meatball joint\" on the first floor. I had a side salad and a vegetarian meatball slider with spinach almond pesto (which gives you one meatball and one sauce on a bun) and it was plenty of food. The slider was very small, which can be a good thing if you want to try many combinations of meat and sauce. There are many different combinations, and I'm sure there is something for everyone.

Our server, I believe her name was Joanna, was very attentive and took a lot of time to describe how the meatball menu worked. 

All in all, I had a good time. The Meatball floor would be good for grabbing a quick bite before a show, as we were in and out in a little under an hour."}
{"text":"I ate here last night with my boyfriend and our friends. I had the saucy balls combo with 2 chicken balls and 2 vegetarian. The chicken ones were excellent and the vegetarian ones were good but I liked the chicken better. I had the tomato basil cream sauce which was so good. I paired all of that with the tomato rosiutto. We also got the cheesy bread appetizer with the tomato basil cream sauce instead of the marina it comes with that they suggested and it was excellent. My boyfriend got the crack sauce for his Choice of a sauce and it was exactly the way it was described because it was delicious. It was a ranch base sauce and a must try!"}
{"text":"There's one certainty-- we all die.  We don't know where we go when we die.  But short of Heaven, there won't be better food than the Emporio's meatballs.  Decadent, tender, balanced.  Absolutely delicious.  My wife and I truly regret we won't be making our hitherto annual Pittsburgh pilgrimage this year.  These are the best meatballs this side of mortal demarcation of life and death."}
{"text":"Had a really great dinner here last night! We came around 7:45, and the wait for both floors was about 90 mins. We chose the meatball floor, put our name in, and went up to the 3rd floor to grab drinks and wait.

The 3rd floor bar is so nice! I loved the rooftop. We got drinks and just chatted, waiting for our table. Just under 90 mins later, our app told us the table was ready, so we headed downstairs and were seated right away.

For the table we got an order of fried pickle chips (sooooooo fantastic) and buffalo chicken balls. The chicken was really spicy but really good. For dinner I chose two pork meatballs with the pork bolongese (panini). My friends got sliders, and we also got two sides of risotto to split.

There was sooo much food! We barely put a dent in the risotto, and I could only eat half of my panini. It was pretty spicy. It was just okay.. Not my favorite. My friends got one of the Asian meatball sliders (it was the daily special) and said it was fantastic. I wish I got that!

The price was actually really affordable. We got split checks, and each of us paid less than $20, including tip (but not including our drinks we paid for upstairs).

So, final word: great rooftop bar; very crowded; good prices; decently-good food. I'd come back, but maybe earlier in the day with less of a wait."}
{"text":"I went to Emporio a couple weeks ago and it was exceptional. Extremely simple food done well. I had the poutine with tater tots, bacon, cheese, and mushroom gravy as well as a wedge salad, olives, and Parmesan fries.  Everything was delicious but the fries were supposed to have vinegar on them and I didn't taste it at all. Nice ambience, but extremely loud and the service was incredibly slow. I'm looking forward to checking out the rooftop bar next time!"}
{"text":"Super fast lunch, tasting very delicious. Had poutine with tader tods, meatballs and marinara sauce. Why 4 stars, the waitress gave me strange look when I said no ice in my coke. I think one is entitled for a cold drink that is not drawning in ice. Overall, great food and atmosphere, definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Great outdoor rooftop to get drinks at! Make sure you check it out, and ask the bartender for tips on drinks. They really know what they're doing.

Pros: 
Great location
Outdoor area amazing during summer

Cons:
Expensive"}
{"text":"What's not to love!  The best rooftop in the Burgh with a retractable roof!  Great selection of drafts beers and attentive servers.
It's a little odd that you are limited in menu selections based on where you sit, and they do not take reservations, which is a bummer.  The meatballs and sides are absolutely delicious and it's worth the wait!  
I would recommend going on a Sunday.  It's still full and fun but not as crowded and overwhelming."}
{"text":"Spicy meatballs on mashed potatoes covered with gravy!  Need I say more.  If you are hungry for comfort food, skip the upstairs roof bar and stay downstairs!"}
{"text":"My wife's favorite - the meatball sliders are just the right amount of food and great tastes."}
{"text":"Placed a reservation over the phone for party of 16 for a party after graduation, and was ensured that there will be no additional fees associated with a party that size (and access to regular menu).  Was informed over phone that an individual would be reaching out \"in next couple of days to make special accommodations of our choice\".  Days later received notice the party would have pre set menu for 60+$ per person.  By the time person reached out through an email, our options are severely limited for dinner on graduation day.  One would think they would right their wrong and honor what we were initially promised."}
{"text":"First night in Pittsburgh and not sure where to go. Looked up Yelp for something pretty close so decided to go here and we weren't disappointed!

We got there at 7:30 and there was a small line out the door. The line moved pretty quick and once at the desk they said it would be a 30-60 min wait. As it was pretty busy we didn't mind as it seemed pretty popular so we decided to go have a drink at the bar. We ended up sitting down at the bar and ordered food from there.

I ordered the beef meatballs with creamy parmesan with spaghetti and my partner ordered beef meatballs with marinara sauce with penne, amazing!

For dessert we had the ricotta doughnuts and again they were amazing!

The also have a wide selection of local beers which we loved and it's great to try local beers.

Great atmosphere at the bar and having a chat to the bar tender. As we were visiting from overseas the bar tender gave us some tips on what to go see over the weekend."}
{"text":"I can not attest to the food as I was never served.  
I was asked to leave this establishment based on my level of intoxication.   As a former bar manger I found this discretion odd, especially considering my intake of only 3 beers during the 4 hours of a Pittsburg Pirates game.   
I was legally able to navigate a motor vehicle, but I was unable to eat a bowl spaghetti at this restaurant.   
I asked to speak to the manager and asked why we would not be served.  Blame was passed to the server who passed it back to the manager who had zero explanation.  Zero.    
The only thing that makes any sense to us was that they close at midnight and we showed up at 11.   
If you don't want to serve food past a certain point then don't, but don't insult the people who have decided to dine at your establishment.  
I am personally embarrassed and completely disappointed in how the server and his manager handled the situation.  
As a business owner myself I feel bad for the owner of this business that has enlisted these people to take care of his business."}
{"text":"Great meatballs and mac and cheese (with creamy parmesan sauce), not so great app. I do not recommend relying on the app at all for accurate waiting times-we were told a 45 minute wait and it ended up being 1.5 hours (though the app also told us by the end of that 1.5 hours that we still had 35 minutes left...which is when we went downstairs to ask about our table). Also had to flag down our waitress because our water was empty... And after we finished the second bottle, it just sat there empty for the rest of our meal.."}
{"text":"I had the worst service and food of my life at this place. Not to mention, when the manager came over, he seemed to not care how unhappy I was. I waited over an hour for food, and my wine was old. The manager(I can't remember his name but he had red hair and a red beard)just made excuses and didn't fix the problem. Needless to say I'll never be back."}
{"text":"I was intrigued when my co-workers told me about this place:  the \"meatball\" restaurant.  I was not disappointed!  I was a bit boring and just got spaghetti and beef meatballs but it was delicious.  Next time I go, I am going to take the route if some of my co-workers and order sliders with different types of meatballs.  I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"You must experience the 3rd floor after indulging in the delicious meatball dishes downstairs! After taking the elevator up to Il Tetto it opens up into an amazing rooftop beer garden with a retractable roof. This means the weather does not stop the experience from happening! http://getwebcanvas.com/"}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a Sunday on the recommendation of a friend. I would love to give it a five except for a few small issues.
The food is delicious and quite different. Everything is built around meatballs. They have 4 varieties and a daily special. You can order them as sliders, grinders etc. but I like the \"Four saucy balls\" for $10.00. You pick a sauce and can pair them with a salad, soup or one of many sides for about $5.00 more. My husband had the beef meatballs with brown mushroom gravy over tater tots and paired them with a salad which was quite large and very good. I had the special sausage meatballs with red sauce with onions and peppers and a side of mac n cheese. All were delicious.
On the flip side....we waited way too long for a waitress to come over and even take our drink order. However once she arrived, service was great. She explained everything clearly and was very helpful.
I would have enjoyed some bread but you don't get any. My \"saucy balls\" didn't have much sauce at all and when I asked for a little more, she charged me $2.00 for it. 
No big deal.
Certainly worth a trip before a show or anytime! Try the parmesan mac n cheese....oh my!"}
{"text":"The vibe, the concept, the fantastic service, and, of course, the food will keep you coming back to Sienna Mercato. The restaurant itself is split into 3 floors, each with its own menu and concept. I have frequented Emporio: A Meatball Joint a few times now and just recently stopped into the rooftop beer garden, Il Tetto. The 2nd floor hosts a charcuterie spot called Mezzo, which I have yet to try.

At Emporio, you will find simple yet delicious apps, salads, and a make-your-own meatball experience. Our favorite items include the olive appetizer, the tomato risotto, Parmesan broccoli, tater tots, and of course, various meatballs. My husband was not a fan of the beef meatballs, mainly because they are purely beef and not a mix of meats like most classic recipes call for. He got it on a hoagie roll and said the sauce and bread were the star, not the meat. That being said, the rest of my family enjoyed the spicy pork and chicken meatballs with a host of sauces. Try the spinach almond pesto for a unique meatball topping or the Tzatziki for some Greek-inspired flair. 

They also feature a meatball of the month which is always a unique take on a meatball. For example, for the month of June, it was an asian-glazed meatball served with Fried rice. 

They have typicals wines, cocktails, and 30+ beers on tap at Emporio and even more upstairs at Il Tetto. You'll find elevated bar snacks at Il Tetto to munch on while you sample some brews.

The prices are reasonable and I've always had quick service! 

Notes on Food Allergies:
I have a ton of food allergies (wheat, soy, shellfish, eggs, apples, zucchini etc... the list goes on). I usually have a lot of trouble eating at trendy restaurants with my family or spouse, but I was pleasantly surprised by the purity of ingredients here at Sienna Mercato. Everything is homemade, the chefs are well aware of all ingredients and I am always given a swift reply as to what menu items I can enjoy. They use dedicated fryers for their tater tots and french fries and they use Canola Oil (Not soy, not peanut! yay!). Always check with your server before ordering because things can change in the restaurant biz, but so far, I have been able to eat delectable fried goods here without worrying about busting out my Epipen or running to the hospital. Thank you, Sienna Mercato!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Visited over the past weekend with a friend. We \"got in line\" using the No wait app - which I would highly recommend using (especially if visiting on the weekends). For two people there was an 80 minute wait for Emporio (the first floor, with the meatballs). 

Since we had time we went to the third level (rooftop bar) for drinks while we waited. They have AWESOME  cocktails... Very unique, not your traditional rum and coke. The space has great ambiance, and is perfect for a summer/fall night. 

The wait time was pretty accurate, but well worth it. We shared the Buffalo Chicken Balls as an appetizer - which are a must if you like buff chix. I had 1 spicy pork slider with creamy parm sauce. All were delicious. The fries were also bomb. 

If in the city this place is a must. I have yet to try the 2nd floor - but plan on doing so in the near future."}
{"text":"Fast seating and service. Ordered meatballs, excellent. Marinara with penne a little too salty for me. Upstairs to bar area. Gorgeous day. Good beer. Had the canolis. They are great too."}
{"text":"And in conclusion.....

Always on the search for an exemplary vegetarian meatball, this place did not disappoint. Good service and great meatballs."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure where to start with Sienna Mercato. They have great beers on draft (Pumpkin FTW), amazing appetizers ( seriously the cheesy bread and pepperoni fritters are ridiculous) and then the best meatballs I've ever had. 

I wholeheartedly reccomend you can the \"saucy balls\" entree. This means you get four GIANT meatballs (choice of beef, chicken, and vegetarian) in any sauce you can possibly think of (recommend Creamy Parm) OVER traditional pairings like pasta or mashed potatoes but also more creative and delicious alternatives like Tomato Risotto or mac & cheese. 

Service was top notch (quick and friendly) which made up for the wait to get in. 

Seriously ..go here."}
{"text":"The veggie meatballs are de-lish at Emporio! I have to admit when the food came out I was a little leery that it wasn't going to be good. The food presentation kinda lacked and the meatballs looked really dry. BUT I was completely wrong. The meatballs weren't dry at all and they were full of flavor. 
Also the portion size is kinda small and I didn't think it was going to be enough food however it was actually more than enough. The food is very filling so no worries on the portion size. 
A great combination is the veggie meatballs with mushroom gravy overtop the parmesan fries. 
I will definitely be back to try different combinations."}
{"text":"Hit the spot after our caps were spanked, I wanted meatballs and this place delivered and offered different meats and sauce accompniments. Very casual and good beer and wine selection.  If your're craving meatballs come here."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks on the open air roof. Great place with friendly staff and a nice open area to wander around and look out over the trees and Penn. The restaurant downstairs is great too (same owners)."}
{"text":"Great rooftop bar!!! There was a mixer here after a conference. It's really close to the center which helps. The mixer had a buffet. Was pleasantly surprised with vegetarian meatballs. Yum! They have a decent list of beer and a great atmosphere when the weathers nice."}
{"text":"This is my go to resturant in Pittsburgh. Never disappoints, and friends and family that visit love it. This month is a buffalo chicken special and OMG the best sauce I have ever had here. It had an amazing kick and the crack fries I could live on!"}
{"text":"I really liked Sienna Mercato!! I can assure you, you've never had a dining experience like it.  It's unique.  You order your meatballs and sauce.  I highly recommend the Saucy balls of 4!  The chicken and beef balls were excellent and the crack sauce is a sure favorite.  There's a reason it's called crack sauce, afterall! You then pick your side.  The crispy Brussels were delightful! My salad, The Rocket, was the best!  It had arugula, tomato, toasted almonds, fresh mozzarella! Can you say delicious? To finish off our meal, we ordered the warmed, powdered donuts for the table that came with dipping chocolate and whip cream.  Yum Yum! Lastly, another reason I enjoyed this joint so much was the lively, happening ambiance.  This place is hip, energetic, unique and the food is pretty darn good!! I highly recommend for your Pittsburgh dining experience!"}
{"text":"Food is great no doubt but don't rely on their seating times. We did have seven in our party and original estimate was 30-45 minutes.  After an hour we inquired about searing as was told we were next only to watch four other walk-ins getting seated. Total wait 1hr 35min.  Recommend large parties skip Metcato and head across the street to Sonoma Grill."}
{"text":"Great place to go to when the weather is nice! Awesome roof top bar...warning- it gets crowded! 

I have gone here both during the week and on a weekend. During the week I had no problem getting a table for about 6 people. They do not take reservations, so going on a weekend can be tricky. You can put your name in and wait at the bar. They do limit the number of people on the rooftop and there can be a long line at times (bummer!). They have a great cocktail list!

For food, I have only tried the meatballs and mac and cheese. Both are great! If you are there with multiple people, I recommend each getting your own order for (4) meatballs with a different sauce and sharing. I love the Parmesan one! Definitely check this place out! Even if you are not a fan of meatballs, they have a different rooftop app menu!"}
{"text":"Amazing beer garden, when weather permits they can open the rooftop and let the sun it. It is so beautiful, drink prices are a tad expensive, but happy hour in their atrium on the 3rd floor is well worth it the extra dollar or two for a cocktail out of sheer beauty. My only complaint is the restaurant is 3 floors, physically not a problem since they have elevators, it's that they have kitchens on separate floors, and their POS (credit card system) is either not connected between the floors, or their insurance rates is too expensive to have their staff running up and down flights of stairs with trays of food/drinks every shift. So while i enjoyed my drinks in the beer garden on the third floor, I had to close out my tab upstairs, then call the restaurant I was already at, put in a To-Go order. Take the elevator downstairs, pay at the hostess stand separately for my To-Go order, then wait for my food in the waiting area. (I ordered truffle fries so I was only waiting for two minutes.)

My only critique is that I completely understand having different menus depending on which floor you are seated in. I just would have liked to be able to order my fries (only offered on the first floor) while I was closing out my tab in their beer garden on the third floor, and grab it on my way out. It would have saved me from having to pay twice in one establishment, and also save my party a few minutes while we were trying to leave."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday party. We had dinner on the second level in the Mezzo, where they feature more fine dining options and charcuterie. 

What is really nice is that you are able to have half portions of the pasta, which is still plenty for one person. I had the seafood risotto and it was great! Another thing is that with a party of 9, they were very accommodating. 

The only real downside was that this place doesn't take reservations. The longer wait for the food was understandable due to it being dinner time on a Friday and also the fact that there were 9 in our party. In addition, they also allowed us all to split the checks, which is rare for many establishments for large parties. Our waitress was really nice as well!

I can't wait to visit the rooftop beer garden in the summer!"}
{"text":"Emporio rocks!  I stopped by after a so-so evening at nearby Seviche and loved it.   I sat at the bar (plenty of space) and ordered a Captain and Coke, a chicken parm meatball slider and the tater tots.   One slider and a side really was plenty of food and it was less than $10.   The meatball was tender and delicious and the bun was just enough - can't stand a slider that's all bun.   The tater tots were crisp and salty.   I spied on my neighbor's meal - a meatball sub with pesto and a side of mac and cheese - that's going to be my next order for sure.   Overall, a winner.  Not a big fan of the backless bar stools and the bar service was a tad slow (the place was packed though), but that's the only criticism that I could come up with."}
{"text":"Meatballs are the BOMB! Great service, atmosphere and food. Such a fun time, our 2 teenage sons enjoyed it as much as my wife and I did."}
{"text":"This place is three restaurants in one. 

Starting with the most amazing, Il Tetto is the rooftop beer garden.  There is a glass roof that retracts (don't worry, there are millions of space heaters), and the view is amazing.  I haven't tried the bar snacks on this floor, but the bartenders are super-friendly and the ambiance is 100% worth it even if they were serving nothing but IC Light. 

Mezzo is the restaurant on the middle floor.  It gets super-crowded, so I recommend using NoWait or going on off-hours.  They have a full menu heavy on pizza and pasta.  While not super-sophisticated, it's also not red-sauce/Olive Garden Italian, which is a great. 

Emporio is the meatball joint on the ground floor.  Everything I've tried so far is solid, if not earth-shattering.  The bar is a great spot for happy hour, to watch a game, or just to spend 4-5 hours on a Saturday afternoon until you fall off of your bar stool (uh, my friend told me that last part)."}
{"text":"I tried Sienna Mercato for the first time for lunch recently. I had read about the place and it sounded interesting; with different menus on the different levels. What none of the reviews noted however was that at lunch time, ONLY the ground floor is open, so you're stuck with just the \"meatballs\" menu.
I had the beef meatball slider and shared a poutine. The beef meatballs were quite good, although sliders was a misnomer. Sliders should be two separate small sandwiches but instead it was two meatballs on a small sub roll sliced the long way. The meat sauce it came with was quite tasty.
The poutine was disappointing though. I love a good poutine and even in Pittsburgh you can find better poutine, for instance at Park Bruges, and the fries at Butterjoint are tastier. The gravy was disappointingly not very flavorful and the fries rather quickly got soggy.
I'd probably give it another try but I'd aim for happy hour; I suspect that's the best time of day to eat there.
Over $18 for 2-meatball slider order and poutine at lunchtime. Frankly I think that's pretty expensive by Pittsburgh standards."}
{"text":"I love this place to grab drinks after work. The rooftop bar is a great experience and they have plenty of beer and drinks to choose from. Seating is limited but there is plenty of standing room."}
{"text":"Ate at the emporio portion with my daughter on take your child to work day. Loved the bowls we ate. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"After making a stop on the third floor at Il Tetto, we went to Emporio to get something to eat before the Pens game. Never saw a restaurant concept built around the humble meatball. Obviously, the owner/chef had to have had other successful places in order to get the financing or to implement the idea for this place. You can get 2 meatballs in a panini, 3 in a hoagie, or 4 on a plate. Other options include types of cheese and the type of sauces.
Friendly servers & good selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"Sienna Mercato is always one of my go to spots. Whether it's for happy hour, dinner or late night drinks on a Saturday night. It has so much going for it really, il tetto and mezzo and MEATBALLS. I've been to all three establishments and love them all! I can honestly say for how busy they get, I have never had an issue with bad service and that's a big deal. 

On my most recent visit, I ordered the ground chicken meatballs with the crack sauce (hot sauce and ranch). That took everything to the next level. You get 4 balls and they make it extra saucy which I love. If you want to throw a side of tater tots in that will be an additional charge so make note of that."}
{"text":"Food is simple and delicious,  portions are not so big, they are fast and the place is always crowded. I like the dishes that they serve the food..big (bronze I guess) bowls, a cute idea. If you are looking for somewhere cozy and not at all formal, that's a good one, specially at lunch you'll see many men and women are talking about their work and projects and their deadline and bosses..."}
{"text":"Awesome. One of my favorite spots downtown. The beer selection is always fantastic. Meatballs are all incredible. The second floor has such good pizza, pasta, and salads. Awesome place for a date or dinner after work. Try it all!

Get the no wait app to avoid waiting for a table!"}
{"text":"I love the food here and the service is normally pretty good. Never great, but good enough. When they're busy, sometimes they don't handle the crowds too well, but this is still one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I have had Sienna Mercato bookmarked for six months, and I finally came here a few weeks ago with my dad before attending the Symphony.  We came in around 4:30, and it was fairly quiet.  By six, there was a wait on a Friday night.  There are apparently two more levels upstairs, but we ate on the first floor with the meatballs!

I ordered the panini, which is two meatballs.  It was more of a lunch size in my mind, and I would recommend something with 3+ meatballs for dinner.  I choose the beef meatballs, which were yummy.  They are an odd texture, but very large and delicious.  I ordered the creamy Parmesan sauce.  Interestingly, Sienna Mercato places the sauce on the side, so you dip your sandwich.  They are certainly not stingy with the fabulous and delicious sauce.  You also get cheese on the panini.  Overall, my dad and I both enjoyed our sandwiches.

Service was a little lackluster.  Our waitress was great, until she realized no alcohol was being ordered.  She didn't even drop off the check herself, which kind of left a bad impression.  It was a little off-putting to have someone push alcohol so hard.  Otherwise, the prices are fair for downtown, and I would return."}
{"text":"Overall our group was very disappointed when trying Mezzo.  A majority of us had tried Emporio and Il Tetto prior to trying Mezzo.  It reminded me of a butcher in the rye that has BAD pizza and a limited drink menu. We waited 2 hours to be seated so we grabbed drinks at il Tetto. 

Service

The service was very subpar, which I was surprised to see all of the great reviews regarding service on Yelp. The waitress had an attitude and everyone at our table noticed.  The food runners provided better service than the actual waitress. I believe she asked our table maybe once or twice for refill of drinks. Our group had to ask multiple times for refills of water.

Atmosphere

A very small space- Do not go with large groups.  The d√©cor reminded me of Butcher and The Rye.  The music is very loud so the waiters/waitresses have to scream over top of it when trying to explain the menu.  This place feels very out place in between the other two floors as it I felt like they were trying to make it more formal than the other floors.  The drink menu is very limited so do not expect to get the same drinks that you were getting at Ill Tetto. 

Food

Our group ordered a variety of different pizzas and a few appetizers. The appetizers were not bad but thought they were a little pricey for what they were offering.  Honestly, this was probably some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  The sauce is not very good.  A few of the pizzas were extremely salty and everyone in our group noticed this. There were 8 of us in the group and not one of us were impressed.  You cannot take anything off any of their pizzas and can add a few listed items to them. I've never tried the location in market square so I cannot compare, but I obviously compared it to il pizzaiolo which is on an entirely different level than Mezzo.  The cookies at the end might have been the best part of our meal."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Casual and comfortable.  Awesome beef and pork meatballs. Really loved the mac and cheese! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Mezzo was great! The mushroom risotto was amazing and the 2 pizza we got we're really good. Even though the menu was small and simple we were really impressed with the food. The fried zucchini was really small but really good. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I had a good time with a group of coworkers. The weather was very pleasant and we sat near enough to the street to enjoy the weather but not be impacted by the traffic sounds.  Everyone but me was from out of town. One of them is also a yelper and was excited to try the meatballs. I was pleasantly surprised that I could just order one meatball for 3.50.  Awesome, so I ordered two and split an order of brussel sprouts with a coworker.  I tried the vegetarian and the beef, both in marinara sauce.  The beef was great, the vegetarian not so much.  Maybe a different sauce would have helped, there are many to choose from.  As other reviewers have stated, the meatballs could be warmer.  The brussel spouts were good also. Splitting an order is a good idea because the portion is huge!  What I liked the best were the fried pickles.  I think these were the best fried pickles I've ever had.  Each of us enjoyed the pickles!!  You can imagine parking would be difficult downtown. But I have found parking right at a corner lot at Penn & 10th to be convenient. It was $12 the night I was there. As a comparison, a lot in the strip near the Heinz History center was 5$.  (The prices can fluctuate widely day by day depending the events going on, etc.) So great time especially with a group."}
{"text":"Finally got back to try the first floor, meatball floor, at Sienna Mercado.  I am a fan!!!
I was a little hesitant to go because I dont eat meat.  They DO have a veggie option.  Yeah!
They have a great selection of beers on tap which I loved.  They also have a large bar in the back of the restaurant, so if you dont have a reservation you have a place to hang out while waiting.  
The meatballs come in 4 different ways.  They come as a slider, a panini, a grinder and just plain with sauce.  I tried the veggie balls with a pesto sauce.  They were super flavorful and the texture was great.  I was very impressed.  My husband tried the beef with a spicy tomato sauce and loved his as well.  We got the mac and cheese as a side to split.  It was tasty as well.  
I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Outstanding food, amazing service, fun atmosphere! A definite go-to in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Air conditioning outside.  Attractive people in their mid twenties.  Penguins had their Stanley cup team party here for good reason. Food and drinks are good too."}
{"text":"Loved this place! My favorite place we went to when I was visiting Pittsburgh. Had dinner on the first floor and ate meatballs galore WITH poutine. Yum. And then we preceded to the top floor for drinks. Great place for upper 20's ground and early 30's, opposed to the other places we went the night before that were too young. The drinks the great. atmosphere was fun. And loved the open rooftop style."}
{"text":"Been in Pittsburgh for a year and while I've walked by Mercato 2-3 times a week, it's always been packed and they don't take reservations.  This week, we were able to go in and get a table for six with no wait.

Appetizers - Pepperoni Fritters, Mushrooms, Fried Chicken Balls, French Fries.  All great!  The Chicken Balls were probably my favorite, though we ordered more fries too.

Dinner - I got the Saucy Balls, which is four meatballs (I picked Spicy Pork, though they also have beef, turkey and vegetable) with Creamy Parmasen sauce (there is a variety of sauces available).  Very good, and a great deal for $11.  For an additional $4, they will serve them over the side of your choice (e.g. risotto, mac & cheese, fries, broccoli, etc.).  That's the only non-bread choice....if you want to get only 1 ball, it comes as a slider; 2 as a panini, 3 as a hoagie...but you can order any of those without bread, but they won't add melted cheese.  

Good draught beer selection as well.  Dessert was a pecan ball...basically a scoop of vanilla ice cream covered in pecans and served with hot fudge.  As amazing as it sounds.  Three per order.

I think there are three levels here, and each is different.  My colleague went to the 2nd level and said it was an Italian restaurant.  What I'm describing was on the main floor.

As I mentioned, it's usually busy, especially after work.  Seemed to be that the later you go, the less crowded it it."}
{"text":"Mezzo: Awesome pizza with unique flavors. Good to share for 2 or 3. 
IL Tetto: Great rooftop atmosphere with amazing views, service, and drinks."}
{"text":"What a spot! Great service rustic ambiance and above all: great food! My recommendation; the octopus pizza"}
{"text":"We dined here last night, and while the food and wine were great, we noticed a furry little creature (a mouse) scurrying about. It was hiding under one of tables and kept poking its little head out. See the picture attached. Avoid this place until this issue has been resolved (if at all)."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for meatballs, Sienna Mercato (Emporio) will come through just fine.  A neat open air layout with refreshing decor located in downtown Pittsburgh.

The majority of the dishes revolve around the wonder that is a meatball!  It is almost like you are building a Lego set as you follow the step by step directions in the menu and then they are properly reinforced by the server:
1. Select your meatball...(4 or 5 different flavorful blends).  Be sure to be on the lookout for the Daily Meatball, which is what I selected at the recommendation of our sever.  The \"Daily\" on my particular visit was the hot sausage.
2. Select your Sauce... 8 or so different sauces to choose from.   I found the Parmesan to be quite delightful.
3. Serving Options...  Sliders, Grinder, Panini or just straight balls and sauce.  I opted for the panini style and it did not disappoint.


The food menu may not be that diverse but SM makes up for it with a fantastic beer list.  A great selection of tap handles with the crafts of Pittsburgh well represented.  I went for Fat Head's Bumbleberry Honey Blueberry Ale and it was darn good!

This is a simple one and a trend that I have observed at more and more restaurants but SM keeps a bottle filled with fresh water on the table.  This is a nice touch and one that is well appreciated by this diner.

Service was on point and not too pricey.  I am throwing my endorsement behind this one."}
{"text":"Had dinner downstairs at the meatball restaurant. Food was great. Jordan, our server, was AMAZING! She was great with the suggestions and had some killer combinations for the food selections. We were guided through the menu and listened to her describe what she liked. It was mouth watering. We finished dinner and went to the third floor for drinks and dessert. The place was busy and service there was friendly but slow. 
All in all a good place to go for food and drinks with killer service downstairs. 
Give Jordan a raise!!!!

Visit two was awesome. Requested Jordan. Service was amazing. She not only remembered us but she actually remembered our individual orders. Nuts. Good stuff. Come in. Ask for Jordan."}
{"text":"What a cool spot.  After the openings of Emporio and Il Tetto, I didn't know what to expect here - I love the meatball joint, and don't particularly care for Il Tetto.  I love love love Mezzo. I can definitely add this place to my list of places that I truly enjoy and will frequent. 

We had a lovely window/garage door open seat on our first visit. We ordered the Butcher Board with cheese... And boy was it yummy.  They make the charcuterie in house (cheeses are not made in house). We then opted to split a pizza (perfect for two people).  We had the margherita but there were several others calling my name. It gives me something more to go back for.  They have a selection of great sounding pastas (more to try), a dessert list that even I (who is not a big sweets person) was interested in- we opted for the Pear Br√ªl√©e. Nothing was disappointing. That also includes the wine list and the service. 

We came back again and did the Chef's Table with a group, and all I can say is damn it was good. So much food! It's five courses of yummy.  Meat and cheeses, eggplant caponata, toasted bread, salad, pizzas, pasta galore, and dessert.  The assortment was fabulous.  We left with full and happy bellies! 

This place is on my top five places to go for date night in Pgh already :) I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Service here is prompt. Our sever was a funny guy and really liked talking about the balls he offers! It was a ton of fun. Actually had some decent choices for gluten free and it was excellent. Four meatballs is a bit much for me, looking forward to the leftovers. Would recommend this place for a fun, casual night."}
{"text":"I have been coveting this place for some time after seeing my friends' photos and was excited to finally try it. All of the balls were amazing! Each was super flavorful and tender. I didn't have a single one that was bad, so I can barely think of ways to distinguish them all. The beer selection was decent which was exciting as well. The tater tot pouting was also amazing. I loved the mushroom gravy and the perfectly cooked tots. The cheese was merely normal, but I forgive them for not having cheese curds. It can get expensive pretty quickly so be sure to keep an eye out on your ordering. One of my friends got a ball with a Caesar salad and that looked quite filling."}
{"text":"Love, love this place.  Have been three times and had an excellent experience each time.  They've been running a jalapeno pork meatball in beer cheese sauce special that's outstanding.  On my last visit, my mom ordered the spicy pork in the parm sauce -- quite delish.  Also found the pickle chips and the tater tots to be above the norm.  (Do skip the escarole and beans, though.  They were on the more mediocre side, especially considering the other options.  Also we weren't huge fans of the turkey meatball.)

Service is quick and pleasant.  Booze prices are reasonable and the selection quite good.  Try their negroni if you like them -- you won't be disappointed.

Overall, a really great and reasonably priced addition to downtown.  (If you've been to the meatball shop in NYC, this place is a nice borrowing of the idea...) 

Oh, and to one of the prior comments... you can get meatballs with sauce individually.  My mom did just yesterday.  It might be priced differently than the \"saucy balls entr√©e\", but it is definitely possible.  Just ask."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in pgh.  It is something different than you will get anywhere else.  I used to think how good could meatballs be?  But after going I realized I was mistaken.

My usual go to is the regular meatball with the parmesan sauce, over top of the seasoned fries.  If I am only going for lunch I will stick to the panini or sliders, because the saucy balls is a lot of food.  They also have a meatball of the month which I usually like to try in slider form.  The best one I have ever had was the Buffalo chicken and I hope they bring it back eventually.

Aside from the good at sienna, there is a rooftop bar which is a great happy hour spot."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try out this meatball place. Wanted to go here as they have lots of vegetarian options, and in Pittsburgh that is not so common! Shared the veggie meatball and marinara, and veggie meatball and spinach pesto. Both were good! Had the poutine with mushroom gravy. It was not traditional style--made with mozzarella. It was tasty, but there was way too much sauce and cheese with the fries. Good beer list, and a nice casual place for a bite. We'll be back soon to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and fun environment. I love the fact that there are 3 different floors and each has a slightly different theme. They have an excellent selection of beer on tap. When it's nice outside and they have the roof open on the top floor."}
{"text":"Our server, Jamie was wonderful. We went on a busy Friday night and the place was pretty busy. Despite that, she was extremely friendly and was very attentive to our needs.

Although the prices were very reasonable and the menu had a variety of items, 
I was less impressed with the food. If you are going to have a restaurant that serves meatballs, they should be amazing and memorable meatballs!!! I thought they were just ok. My table sampled the beef and pork meatballs with a variety of sauces.

I like that you can order the meatballs in a variety of ways, in sauce, on a sandwich, etc., but my favorite part was the macaroni and cheese! It was a generous serving and I got it with the parmesan sauce. Very good!

I'd give this place another shot because it's reasonably priced and seems to easily accomodate large groups."}
{"text":"This is a long overdue review.  Emporio is, by far, one of my favorite restaurants downtown and one of my go-tos when we have guests from out of town.  I profess...I'm not a meatball fan but this place won me over almost immediately.  

The way the menu works is you pick your meatball, your sauce, cheese and how you want it served.  My preference is the turkey meatball with the pesto sauce and Gouda cheese on the panini.  Normally, turkey meatballs are on the dry side but these are moist and flavorful!  With just two meatballs, the panini is the perfect size for lunch.  I also love the creamy parm and government cheese sauces.   There are a ton of great sides to order from too.  I love the mac and cheese and the tomato risotto.    The fries are tasty too but I think an order of those is big enough to share.   With vegetarian meatballs, spicy pork meatballs and salads, there are options for everyone.    

They also have a wide varieties of craft beers to chose from and some decent wines.  The exposed brick and beams and the open front windows on a nice day, make the atmosphere delightful.   Overall, prices are reasonable if you keep the alcohol to a minimum.   

Be sure to use the nowait app or you could be in for a long wait."}
{"text":"This is a meatball joint. They sell beer and drinks. It is not fine dining. I think they do a great job and they aren't trying to be anything they aren't. I dig this place and I eat here frequently. I do not give out very many 5 star ratings. 4 stars is a really good score for me."}
{"text":"I never knew meatballs could be so varied AND tasty! The waitress was friendly & provided us great service. Nice view from the top floor."}
{"text":"What a great find! Enjoyed a delicious lunch of poutine and meatballs. The restaurant was noisy, but service was quick and friendly. They also have a large selection of craft and local beers. I will definitely go back to try some more specialty meatballs or try pizza on the second floor."}
{"text":"I was excited to finally try somewhere new (new for me since I stick to the same spots). Sadly our visit left us unimpressed. 

It took a little while for our server to greet us.. So long that the manager finally came over with some water. After our server greeted us I stuck with water & my bf ordered a root beer float, which took an entirely long time to be delivered. The manager finally dropped it off. Root beer float is made with bottled Boylan root beer so thankfully it was good.
 
I went with saucey balls with spinach almond pesto & mashed potatoes. My meal was initially brought out with no potatoes. We waited awhile again for our server to fix the problem & finally asked a host who walked by.

 My bf ordered saucey balls with sauce over Mac & cheese. Thankfully the food was good & filling.

We waited forever again for our server to get boxes & the check. 

Our service was terrible & left a crappy first impression. We didn't even get an apology.  I'll save my $45 & make my own dang meatballs and mashed potatoes at home."}
{"text":"Brought my family here from out of town...service was horrendous. Our night started on the 2nd floor with a server who didn't know what Stoli was...literally, no idea that it was a vodka. After 5 of us drank all of our water...we had to prompt her to bring us l more...especially since drinks were forgotten about and took forever to arrive at the table. After waiting 30 minutes for our dinners to arrive, the \"manager,\" if you'd call her that, came to our table to tell us they were out of an ingredient used in one of the daily specials we ordered...she said they were substituting said ingredient for mushrooms. When the 2 people in my party that ordered the dish both said they didn't want mushrooms in their dish, the manager had to go ask the chef if that was ok. Since when do we live in a world where the chef tells you if you will or will not be eating a certain ingredient...like they didn't have an option?  Not to mention the fact that our dinners should have been on the table at that point...not even started yet I'm assuming. Food was actually pretty good when it finally made it to the table...except for the fact that the server told us if we wanted a different dressing for our salad that we ordered SOS that we would be charged. So we have to pay extra because your gross pesto dressing just isn't cutting it? Cool. $2 for a tablespoon worth of dressing. Anywho...when the bill came, we asked her to split it evenly 3 ways with our credit cards. This is a simple operation for any operating system...I know because I work in the restaurant industry. She somehow charged 2 of us for $50 and 1 of us $100. It was pretty obvious that this restaurant needs some tweeking. When I spoke to the manager on the way out the door she could have cared less. I guess that's what these types of restaurants are turning into now...they just don't care about the quality of the service or the satisfaction of the customers...because people are going to go there regardless.  Bad experiences are shrugged off and ignored because their sales are good and the money is coming through the door. Pretty sad if you ask me. The manager didn't even try to make things right...and she never did a single table check to see how things were going with our meal and service. Needless to say we were not impressed...and we will not return. Not that it matters to them..."}
{"text":"Let me tell you: I was very excited that there was a place solely dedicated to meatballs. Although I have limited exposure to homemade meatballs, I really enjoyed the meatballs from Emporio (Sienna Mercato). Their concept for their meatballs is equivalent to Subway. What I mean by this is that you get to choice every single step of your entree. You start off by choosing the type of meat, then the sauce, what type of vehicle you want your meatball to be in, and optional sides. I ordered the classic beef with marinara sauce as a meatball slider and got the tomato risotto as a side. The meatball itself was very large and I was full after the slider. My one complaint would be the tomato risotto. Unlike other risottos I have tried, I could tell that the rice had been par-cooked and then added to the sauce which is not how a traditional risotto is made. As a tip of the restaurant, I would not advertise \"tomato risotto\" if it is not cooked in the risotto technique. Other than that, I would definitely go back and try the many combinations!"}
{"text":"I went to Emporio on a Wednesday night. It was busy with lots of customers, but we still got a seat fairly soon. I am not a person who typically enjoys meatballs, but I do admit that their meatballs tasted pretty good. I thought that the poutine and the tater tots tasted just OK. The waiter was nice and brought out our drink refills and later the bill promptly."}
{"text":"Dustin was amazing.  We stopped in wanting a complicated warm beverage, he was more than willing to comply.  Not only did he make our difficult order with a smile,  he went above and beyond to make sure it was delicious!!! Any time I am near penn, I will definitely be back to utilize his mad bartending skills along with his engaging  personality!"}
{"text":"I've never had a better meat ball. The food was awesome, fast sevice, great beer selection and perfectly priced. The Chef even came out and chatted. Everyone was friendly. Can't recommend enough.

They will also work with ANY allergy, including Gluten Free."}
{"text":"Interesting experience and they have balls!  Food was good but we ordered way too much and obviously server let us!  It was fun and good food."}
{"text":"Came here on a romantic date with my honey.  Started with dinner in \"Mezzo\".  Got a great table next to the window.  Delicious food, great service, beautiful atmosphere.  Loved that we could just carry our drinks upstairs to the roof bar.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Probably the best meatballs I have ever eaten. We loved the beer selection as well as the pesto! Will be coming back many times again!"}
{"text":"We went to mezza at sienna mercato. We had an Italian cheese plate and the sausage and peppers pizza. Everything exceeded our expectations including the delicious ros√© on a warm day. We then proceeded upstairs to the beer garden. My disappointment came that they don't have the same drink menu and it was very loud. I had to drink a different wine (not a single ros√© available) and we couldn't hear each other speak. Not horrible, but my only complaint! If we would have just eaten dinner and left, it would have been perfect!"}
{"text":"Good food.  The lunch is a little expensive and this is not a good place for a crowd.  I went with about 12 coworkers for happy hour on a Wednesday night.  They were less than accommodating.  They wouldn't allow tables and chairs to be moved etc.  There were few customers in the restaurant.  They kept saying that they needed to accommodate others...who these others are I have no idea!  Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love the layout of Sienna Mercato!  It's 3 stories with Emporio (meatball joint) on the ground floor, Mezzo (Italian restaurant) on the second, and Il Tetto (rooftop beer garden) on the third.  I've only been to Il Tetto.

After a long day, I wasn't ready to navigate this place but the staff were very friendly and accommodating.  They showed me the elevators to the beer garden (it's in the back) and the best spot to view the skyline (also in the back).  It's only a small section of the Pittsburgh skyline so while not breathtaking, it's still a scenic and open beer garden with its pretty strings of light."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything bad to say about Sienna Mercato. I've only eaten on the 1st floor, so I can't speak for the 2nd or 3rd levels, but the Emporio Meatball shop is on point. Food is fantastic, service is fantastic, atmosphere is classy but not too uppity. I have had a drink on the rooftop bar, and it's the best rooftop that I have been too thus far in Pittsburgh. I've been to the Meatball Shop in NYC, and Sienna Mercato has them beat easily."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and I definitely would hang out here again!  

The only downside was that I wanted to eat vegetarian and ordered the vegetarian saucy balls, they were very mushy and not as crispy as I was hoping.  I was hoping for a crisper outside to make it a better texture but it all sort of squished apart. (Is that even a word!?)

I would definitely go back and try the other meatballs, however in my opinion if you're a vegetarian perhaps this is not the best option of places to eat. The rest of my vegetarian meal so delicious, I ordered a side of broccoli and got my saucy balls with the pesto, I did want to actually do shots of this stuff it was SO good! 

All in all great experience and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Meat eaters and meatball lovers this is your place!"}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hype is. I went there the other day and tried some of the food, and was straight out unimpressed. It could have been an off night. It seemed busy, but it was not crazy busy where the service and quality would have been compromised. There was a Pens game going on at the same time, so the bar was a bit full with people watching the TV's.
Italian is one of my favorite types of food, and I don't consider myself a snob at all. However, of the three appetizers ordered between my friend and I, not one was finished by the time we left.
On a plus note, the drinks were decent, and the service was ok."}
{"text":"Everyone kept telling me to try this place and now I understand why. I had a spicy pork ball with a risotto base and it was very tasty. The arugula salad with toasted almonds was great as well. I love to go into a new place and have my server order for me. Aubrey didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Definitely a unique menu, but I wasn't overly impressed. If you are a big meatball fan or looking for something new to try and you can customize your meat balls/pasta/sauce. I ordered 2 chicken, 1 spicy pork, and one beef meatball. They were average and I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Large open windows, great environment, good service, great food. I'm from Montreal and they serve poutine!  Atmosphere is quite similar to Burgatory: decor & layout"}
{"text":"I wasn't really aware of this place until we walked by and saw their little thing on the street advertising happy hour, meatballs, and all that. I'm no meatball connoisseur, but that alone was attractive enough and so we went inside. For a first timer, it was a bit confusing that there were three levels, but we were quickly seated in Emporio for the small eats menu. 

We got four \"Saucy Balls,\" which consisted of beef with spinach and almond pesto, along with a crab balls appetizer. The latter came with 5 and was fairly good, nicely fried on the outside and lots of delicious crab meat on the inside. The meatballs were amazing though. They were not overly firm, and they also contained a lot of flavor. The green pesto also paired pretty well with them and the accompanying penne side. Probably some of the best meatballs I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great beer selection and awesome food!  Had the spaghetti with 2 meatballs and just right before marathon!"}
{"text":"Fun place with meatballs, small plates and craft beers on the first level. Can't wait to try the other two floors with varying menu. Enjoy the ambience of the place which a mix between restaurant and a nicer bar. Great that they can have the front window open for fresh air and sunlight. The beers selection were very good with craft local beer selections on draft. Meatballs were very tasty which you can choose a various meats and sauce combo. Service was quick and very friendly. Look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Pretty solid!  I'm taking a bus over to Greyhound and rather than getting an overpriced dry turkey sandwich, I thought I should treat myself to some deliciousness!

I got the vegetarian meatball panini and it far exceeded my expectation in terms of size of meatball and flavor.  Your entire panini is essentially your meatballs.  I also consider the white bean, mushroom meatball a thoughtfully crafted vegetarian choice, compared to other restaurants who consider their vegetarian option some sort of overcooked seitan.  My only caveat is that the panini is a little small for the $7.50 price tag.  I think it would have been more appropriately priced at $6.  It's definitely snack size.

With such a great vegetarian option, I'm sure their carnivorous options are more than great!"}
{"text":"We decided to dine at Emporio a few weeks ago. I think that I really just picked the wrong thing to have here unfortunately...but I will agree with my coworker who recommended this place - get the sliders so you can try a few different things!! I like to eat, and two plus shared fries were plenty for me.

 My husband's traditional beef meatballs with marinara were good, but I didn't even finish my two sliders. My coworker had recommended the tzatziki sauce with a turkey meatball so that's what I went for! The tzatziki was not like the traditional ones I am used to, and was actually kind of sour and thin with an extreme dill taste and large thin slices of cucumber. Not for me. I also had a beef meatball with pork bolognese which was pretty good. (I will say that I don't particularly like that they give you cheese on the side and don't heat it onto the slider for you if you request it. It just resulted in a cold piece of cheese on my meatball.) My husband did not like this slider and said that it tasted like pumpkin to him (?)

I will say this. The fries were FANTASTIC! I added some extra malt vinegar to the malt vinegar aioli as the aioli didn't have quite enough bite for me.

The last note I'll make I'm not quite sure how to say - there wasn't enough \"sauce to ball\" ratio. I would've preferred the meatball smashed with more sauce or even a side of sauce. It just wasn't enough to go with the entire thing."}
{"text":"Mezzo is awesome - local cheeses, charcuterie, pizza, and wine. The pistachio and porchetta pizza is AMAZING, I've never had anything like it. We went for a group dinner during a Steelers home game, so it was pretty quiet, but still with a good atmosphere. Wine selection is stellar, our server Andi was knowledgable and friendly and great!"}
{"text":"I'm a world traveler, and have been to many bars and restaurants in many corners of the world. I've never been treated as disrespectfully as I was at this location. I will not return. After having one glass of wine, a young worker talked to me very disrespectfully and told me I cannot handle my liquor after simply requesting to use the elevator to get to the bottom floor. He threatened to call the police because I didn't want to walk down the stairs as he demanded. My date was waiting for me on the bottom floor, as I went to the upper level to close my tab. I would not suggest this establishment for anyone's patronage. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"What a delightful dining experience!
Came here for dinner on a Friday evening, before watching a show in Pittsburgh's downtown. We visited \"Mezzo\" the second floor of the restaurant, which mainly has Italian dishes like pizza, pasta and paninis. The first floor is a meatball joint and the third floor is a beer rooftop garden. We were quickly seated as we had already made a reservation. 
The waitress was so attentive, and she explained to us the menu thoroughly. I started with the riesling, which was smooth and sweet. For the entree, I had the Shrimp Fra Diavolo which was a spicy red sauce, orecchiette pasta and fresh shrimp. My dining partner had the vegetable panini, which I grabbed a bite out of, and I found that to be really good with fresh vegetables, pesto sauce and mozzarella cheese.
I loved the atmosphere of this place, which was casual yet a little hip! I would love to go back and try the other levels in this restaurant as well!"}
{"text":"This place has the best balls I have ever had! I left very satisfied with the balls that I got. I was worried when I first got here because the menu looked like it had so many different balls. Then I ordered the spicy balls and they were amazing. The spicy balls did sting a little at first but as I kept going it got better and better. I went here with my friends and everybody enjoyed their balls. I would definitely come back for another round of balls!"}
{"text":"I gave Sienna Mercato a 4 star rating not because the food is necessarily 4 star but it is a welcomed lunch destination for professionals.  The food is good, and may even be pretty good when compared to the price.  I always enjoy my meal there for a very reasonable price, making it a great place to go to lunch."}
{"text":"First time customer.   Went to bottom floor meatball joint. Poutine was delicious.  Matzoball and Italian wedding soups both good.  Buffalo chicken meatballs with blue cheese and meatball hoagie excellent   Highly recommend the ricotta doughnuts for desert. Love it. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I only go when the roof is open. It is great to enjoy late night drinks with friends on the roof. I have ate here once and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I had the fried peppers appetizer which was excellent. Also had the whiskey sour, which was one of the best whiskeys drinks I had. However the waitress sucked. Not attentive and confused"}
{"text":"In the past week, my girlfriend and I have eaten at Sienna Mercato in two different capacities - first, in the restaurant in their fine-dining \"Mezzo\" restaurant, then again at the \"Emporio\" food stand at the pop-up market on Friday, July 10.  Of Sienna Mercato, I can only say this: their food is some of the most poorly thought-out, most poorly executed, and most pretentious food I have ever eaten. I didn't leave this restaurant merely disappointed, I left angry, confused, and utterly frustrated at one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.

Let's start with Mezzo. Mezzo started off okay: the server was friendly and knowledgeable, and the wine selection was top-notch. The menu seemed a bit small, but that's okay if the dishes are executed poorly. The location itself was lovely; open air, overlooking the street, and very comfortable.

My girlfriend and I started with two appetizers: the artisan bread selection and the lamb meatballs. The breads were excellent, and the spreads that went with them were too. The lamb meatballs were decent; they tasted okay, but they were lukewarm at best and the rest of the accompaniments didn't work (including raisins for some unknown reason).

However, we pressed onward, hoping that some not-hot-enough meatballs would be the only culinary mistake of the night. Unfortunately, the meal continued to go sideways before crashing and burning completely. I ordered the Filet Mignon as their daily farm-to-plate meat special, while my girlfriend ordered their Farmhouse Chicken. My Filet was just fine, but the rest of the dish made no sense. The steak was served with a piece of radicchio that had been pickled and grilled, which left it tasting bitter and awful. The greens were undressed and existed more than anything else. The radicchio was placed over a bed of some kind of puree, which didn't seem to taste of anything I recognized.

Unfortunately, my girlfriend's meal was worse than simply bad; hers was outright dangerous to human health. I really wish I was exaggerating, but her chicken arrived undercooked. We called the waiter over, and rather than being the knowledgeable individual from the beginning of the meal, he hemmed and hawed that he couldn't make substitutions and that he couldn't make any changes. We got the manager over, and my girlfriend switched over to the filet mignon with the sides that the chicken originally had (polenta and green beans). The manager gave us a free order of their artisan bread appetizer while the kitchen refired her food. When it came out, the filet was fine, but the polenta was simply awful. Rather than being smooth and creamy with a delicious corn flavor, it was gritty and bland. The green beans were fine, but undercooked chicken coupled with crappy sides was enough to convince us not to come back to Mezzo.

Then the bill came, and this is what truly made me angry. Even with the comped bread appetizer (a whole $3, by the way), our bill was over $80 per person. That's right, they wanted to charge us $80 a plate for food that could have killed my girlfriend. I paid the bill and walked out, wanting nothing more to do with this restaurant.

Perhaps what angered me as much as the bill, though, was how unfocused the restaurant was. The name implies Italian, the menu says farm-to-table, while the food itself wants to be molecular gastronomy. If the owner is reading this, take my advice: shut the restaurant down, sit down with your head chef, and figure out your restaurant. Once you've done that, then reopen once you know who you are.

My girlfriend and I then ran into a food stand run by Emporio (the meatball place) at the pop-up market on the 10th. I was very skeptical about their food, but I was convinced to give them a shot. Frankly, I wish I hadn't. They were serving a meatball sandwich with \"Government Cheese\" sauce, as well as a Mac 'n' Cheese made with the same Government Cheese. I wish they would have come out and said just what \"Government Cheese\" is: cheap, American cheese. That cheese overpowered every other flavor in both dishes to the point that all you could taste was cheese, cheese, cheese. Add in that the macaroni was overcooked, and Emporio's food stand was as forgettable and terrible as Mezzo.

In conclusion, the two Sienna Mercato establishments I tried provided disgusting and confusing food. It was all overpriced, but presented as some of the best food in the city of Pittsburgh. I will of course never eat here again, and I stand by my earlier advice to the owner: shut this place down and figure things out before the health inspector catches you serving raw chicken to a customer and shuts you down for good."}
{"text":"Service is slow and unfriendly.  The restaurant was uncomfortably warm.  Food was good."}
{"text":"I have a hard time coming up with something that I don't like about this place. 

Sienna Mercato is a three concept restaurant with Emporio on the ground floor and has been opened the longest, Mezzo is fine dining and is not yet open, and Il Tetto is the rooftop beer garden. 

Emporio is a great meatball joint. The whole idea is great. Simple menu, low price point, and good drinks. You choose the type of meatball, the type of sauce, and how you want it served. Saucy Balls tends to be my go-to : Four balls covered in sauce. For $4 extra dollars, you can get the balls served over the side of your choice. The tomato risotto is delish. I recently had 2 balls on a panini and YUM! The texture of the crispy bread, cheese, and smashed meatballs was the perfect combo. The parm herb fries came in a MASSIVE portion, covered in parm cheese, and perfectly crispy. Be sure to start the meal off with a strong drink and some pickle chips. It is all so good! The exposed brick and rustic wood works well with the dark lighting and the huge front window that opens up for nice weather days. 

Be sure to use the NoWait app to get your table, because you could be waiting for quite awhile. If you do get stuck waiting, check out Il Tetto, the rooftop beer garden. Go to the back of emporio to use the elevator to take you up to the third floor. The retractable glass ceiling gives the perfect balance for the unpredictable Pittsburgh weather. At night, the lights strung overhead make for a great atmosphere. It would be a great place for a date, but it also gets pretty crowded. 

Get there fast and stuff balls in your face."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best spots in Downtown Pittsburgh. Great food selection, very nice wait staff and best balls you will find. (Had to). Beer selection is always wonderful. Great Happy Hour spot and perfect before Pens, Pirates, or Steelers games."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a fun rooftop. Older feel on the first floor and Biergarten-style tables fill up the rooftop. FYI there may be a wait to get to the rooftop during the weekend. Group and family friendly."}
{"text":"Went to Emporio for the first time today with some of my friends and had the best service. It was meatball Monday so we got some delicious sliders, Mac and cheese, pasta, tatertots, and hot hot donuts. They were very accommodating to allergies and our server, Sean, had a lot of great recommendations! 11/10 would go again :D"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday with a few friends. The variety of Italian  food was good.  Each floor had a theme. We were on Mezzo. The waitress was very patient and informational. The pizzas and variety of bread with butter and dessert was delicious!! Drinks are vintage and it has nice atmosphere. The price range was a little pricey but not too bad. The roof top was full so I plan to go back earlier and get a rooftop view!"}
{"text":"Looks nice, but that's about it. Confusing set up with three separate restaurants with their own individual food and drink menus. I went here with a large group after a work conference. We called a week prior and inquired about reserving the rooftop, and were told it was first come, first serve but that sitting together wouldn't be an issue. Not sure how, but our group ended up on the second level, which is again a different restaurant, and we were all at separate tables. It was very odd and defeated the purpose of coming as a group. The menu on the second floor was more appetizing than the rooftop, but the beer and wine selection was minimal. Everyone ordered pizza and I ordered the scallops off the \"medium plate\" section. They came out and I was surprised to see two very tiny scallops surrounded by various greens, pancetta (not \"bacon\"), and a sauce. The scallops were so overcooked they bounced off the bowl, which should have stopped me from trying them but it didn't. They were as salty and overcooked as they appeared, and the pancetta was chewy and not nearly crispy enough. I ended up sending them back. It seemed that everyone enjoyed the pizza, but wood fire pizza isn't that difficult to make palatable so I wasn't impressed. 

Our server was nice and attentive, which I appreciated. My only complaint was that when refilling the water I noticed all of the servers touching the mouth of the water to the lip of everyone's glasses. That is unsanitary and just nasty, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Was there and the food was average.  Then there was an off duty Pittsburgh Police officer in there eating....naturally he had his service weapon concealed however the manager came up and asked him if he had a weapon.  The officer identified himself as a PIttsburgh Police officer and told the manager that he had his service weapon.  The manager asked him to leave......the nerve.  I will never enter your establishment again as long as you have concealed carry policy and to apply it to law enforcement is absurd."}
{"text":"Truly an old world Italian restaurant with a great selection of comfort food dishes and a great atmosphere to boot. What struck me most about the place was the authentic feeling. It's like venturing into a restaurant, a bistro, from a by-gone era. I loved the charm - and the house made sausage was darn good as well."}
{"text":"Lots of options, even for people who don't eat meat. The poutine with tater tots is fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is fun! Three levels to choose from. Level 1 has nicely priced pub food designed around a meatball. At Thanksgiving they had a turkey and stuffing meatball with cranberry sauce! Level 2 is upscale. I had the cheese plate with local cheeses and the mushroon risotto. Large portions and giid food. Level 3 is an outdoor beer garden with interesting drinks. I had a home brew peach drink that tasted like peach pie moonshine. Loved it! Very cool place for happy hour or pre game!"}
{"text":"Rooftop bar is beautiful and great for a night out, the waitress we had was constantly coming over to check on us and give us drinks and the place was packed.  The 1st floor was also packed and we had excellent service from the waiter and I was surprised at how good the food was."}
{"text":"For as much hype that I had heard about Emporio, I was a little disappointed in my first visit.

Pros:
- the food is excellent!  sauces tasty, meatballs flavorful and moist, sides surprising and delicious.

- atmosphere is trendy and inviting.  

- our server was friendly, helpful, and on her game.  reading some of the other reviews citing poor service - today was much better than 

Cons:
- i was disappointed by the size of the lunch entree.  i ordered the panini, with 2 meatballs.  it's literally half a sandwich, cut on a diagonal.  the meatballs are bigger than a golf ball, but not by much.  i think i was expecting Buca di Beppo size meatballs, because it's a meatball restaurant.  or at least a whole sandwich.  the dish of sauce that accompanies the meatballs was delicious, and there was enough to dip the sandwich in.  

- maybe I'm too old, but i felt that it was too dark in the booth that we were seated in.

- some of the waitstaff wore tshirts with the restaurant name on hem, but many others just seemed to wear whatever they wanted. I wasn't sure who was working there vs. not.  

- though i liked the atmosphere, it's very similar to tenpenny, right around the corner.

i'm giving this three stars, mostly due to the portion size of the panini being much smaller than I expected."}
{"text":"When the meatball joint opened, it was amazing!  Reasonably priced food, great service and good portion size.  The last time I was there, the prices had gone up, the food portion went down and the service was terrible.  The new menu charges you separately for every bit of food you can add to your plate. I e-mailed the restaurant with our service issue and no response.  Can't say I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Modern, popular, and delicious! I get 1 or 2 meatball sliders usually- the beef w/ Arrabiatta is my favorite! The buffalo chicken balls appetizer was very very hot- too spicy for me. Definitely not a traditional buffalo wing flavor- this one is buffalo kicked up 3 notches. The salads are good but a little pricey. Nice beer & hard cider selection!"}
{"text":"The meatballs are killer. Excellent cocktails.  Order s bunch of apps and meatballs and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is great. I love the look of the interior and the overall \"feel\" here. I went here before going to a Pirates game later in the evening and I am very happy that I chose to eat here.

We got the fried pickle chips, which come with bacon ranch and they were really good. The ranch was excellent and had a nice smoky bacon flavor to it. I ordered the original beef meatball panini and chose the spinach almond pesto sauce. It was absolutely delicious!! They give you the sauce in a small metal bowl that is big enough to dip the sandwich easily and they give you plenty of sauce. It was great. I shared half of my sandwich with my roommate and she got the spicy pork and it was just as delicious with the sauce, if not more so! I am DEFINITELY coming back here soon."}
{"text":"We ate on the first floor. This was not my favorite place to eat but the food is decent. I do like the atmosphere and the rooftop bar is a cool place to grab a drink. I am going to head back and check out the second floor dining and grab another drink at that bar."}
{"text":"Three of us ate at Mezzo on a Sunday night.   The atmosphere was pleasant, although it had been a hot day and the temperature in the restaurant was uncomfortably warm.   Our server was good, but the kitchen must have been having an off night.   We all got first courses, but one showed up about 10 minutes before the other two.  Not a big deal, but to me it was a foreshadowing of some problems in the kitchen.   Main courses came and the shrimp fra diavolo was way too spicy.  I've had it before, I know it should be spicy, but the level of spice in this dish made it impossible to finish.   The real problem came with the pork chop that appeared to be cooked on the outside, but was raw in the middle.  Only about a 1/4 of an inch of the meat all around was cooked.  I realized this after consuming some of it.  I notified the waiter who indeed seemed alarmed at the cold center of the chop and he whisked it away back to the kitchen.  Over ten minutes later it returned fully cooked, but by this time everyone else had finished and I had lost my appetite.  (I still feel sick just thinking about eating raw pork.)     The desserts were okay, but hardly enough to save the evening.

I'm guessing there was no one managing the front of the house (or the back)  because I would have expected that once a customer is served an inch and half thick pork chop with a full inch of it being raw that a manager would have swooped in to a) apologize on behalf of the kitchen, b) make some kind of gesture of forgiveness.   But no, nothing."}
{"text":"Very classy bar! Love the decor. Rooftop bar looks and feels classy and bar tenders are attentive and quick! The bar on top of the restaurant had no coat check, but tables with seating were available giving the classy venue a nice chill vibe. Music was pretty good from what I remember, it's not a dance club but it has sufficient space to get your groove on. Drinks are well made.

Looking at yelp now, I wish we tried the food but next time."}
{"text":"Had an awful experience at Mezzo (Meatball Joint) so awful in fact that I walked out!  I wanted to grab a relatively quick lunch there so when I got there and asked if I wanted a table or take a seat at the bar, I opted for the bar thinking it would be quicker.  

WRONG!  I sat at the bar and waited a few minutes until anyone approached me and they asked if I would be drinking or eating and I said I was just going to eat.  Ok...they left, ignore, ignore, ignore...brought me water 5 minutes later.  Asked for a menu, did a whole bunch of other stuff for a bit and then grabbed a menu which was 2 feet from me and handed it over.  Ignore, ignore, ignore...someone just sat one seat away and was promptly given a drink and menu.  Ignore, ignore, ignore...I had made my decision on food about 10 minutes go.  

Wondering what the hell was going on because there were at least 2 people working the bar area and it wasn't very crowded.  Ignore, ignore, ignore, person sitting one seat away has order taken and that was where I couldn't take it anymore.  The bartender didn't even look at me after taking the other person's order and he was literally an arm length away. 

Walked out.  Not planning on going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Went in for drinks after my wife's work holiday party on a Friday in early January.  For every member of the wait- and bar-staff there were 3 \"bouncers\"(?) wearing ear pieces and standing around watching over the beer hall style bar on the top level.  This got to be especially frustrating when you could not get the time of day from the serving staff to order drinks.  

I can't speak to the food and dining experience, but I can say they don't have it together as a watering hole."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check out this place for a while, and was so glad we got the chance to last night!    First floor is a meatball joint, second floor is a charcuterie/pizza/Italian restaurant, and top floor is a rooftop bar. We ate at the second floor of this three floor establishment.

As we had arrived prior to the rest of our dinner partners, I went for their version of an Italian margarita with tequila.  It was very sweet, tasty, but was lacking much of an alcohol kick surprisingly.  When our friends arrived, we ordered the small charcuterie board and the small Pennsylvania cheese board.  Man, these were amazing!!!  I loved every cheese and every meat, even the more adventurous ones like the rabbit based one.  The server who brought out the boards went through each meat and cheese with us and told us how to incorporate the accompaniments along with the meat and cheese.  Next time, I'd probably order the large ones because I liked it so much!!  Of note, when ordering the meat and cheese board, the waitress asked if we'd liked bread, which out of habit I said yes.  Well apparently, the bread is extra and we did get charged for it, which for an Italian restaurant, I thought was a bit much.

Alongside my dinner I had a glass of pinot noir which was really delicious and complimented to pasta and pizza we had ordered really well.  My fiance and I split their sausage pizza and shrimp fra diavolo for our entree. The pizza toppings were yummy, but we both found the crust to be a little lackluster.  Not bad by any means, but not at the level some other local woodfired pizza places are.  Now the pasta...the pasta.  OMG. So. Good.  First marinara sauce I've ever tasted that is as close to my mom's Italian family recipe.  The pasta was perfectly al dente, shrimp perfectly cooked.  I literally could have put my face in this dish.  AMAZING.

We skipped out on dessert in favor of grabbing a beer downstairs at the Meatball Emporio level.  Great craft beer choice!  I got the Yard's Love Stout and it might just be my new favorite!

The ambiance of the whole restaurant was awesome.  It did have a bit of a hipster vibe, but was warm and welcoming.  The service was also above and beyond most.  Overall, I will definitely be back, especially for the wine, meat, cheese, and pasta!!"}
{"text":"Dinner at Mezzo was amazing! If you love cured and smoked meats, you will love the place. It easily competes with Lawrenceville's \"Cure.\" We had the large Butcher Plate and Pennsylvania Cheese Board to share and it was delightful. The tenderized pork neck was a especially delicious! We split a very flavorful mushroom pizza for a lite dinner and a hazelnut chocolate dessert to cap it off.

Beautiful restaurant. Wonderful food. I can't speak to the first and third floor, but I can confidently say Mezza (2nd floor) was a hit!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Cleveland this place was amazing like TownHall on steriods. 3 floors with a roof top food and drinks both amazing and reasonably priced. Also the staff was top notch especially our waiter Brendan. If you come here definitwly try the food and if you get the bruschetta bring your appetite and visit the roof top. This place is definitely amazing for anyone 25+"}
{"text":"I think this place is massively over-hyped. The food, while not bad, was far from exceptional considering there is a sole focus...and I have no plans to return.

Also, I went with Darren. That dude is great. 

Things we tried: 

1.) Poutine with gravy on fries.
-Fries were as average as you can get, nothing about the gravy or curds stood out. Really lacking in the salt dept.

2.) Arancini (mushroom) w/ truffle aioli.
-A shadow of previous incarnations of arancini I have had in my day. These were tiny and not exceptionally flavorful. I liked eating them but they left so much to be desired.  Also, I am sick of truffle aioli. It's like the sriracha of mayo-y dipping sauces and I wish people could make an effort to be more creative.

3.) Spicy Pork, Classic, and Corned Beef meatballs in various sandwich forms.
-Look guys, if you're going to focus on something..hit it out of the park. Am I biased? Sure. I've been to http://www.yelp.com/biz/salumi-artisan-cured-meats-seattle-2
and these are the best meatballs I have ever had. None of what I had at Mercato was bad persay, but I would never suggest to anyone that these were anything above a typical meat concoction. They are overcooked in the sense that they are cooked a bit above a temp that retains moisture. Though not dry, the texture did leave a bit over a bit to be desired.

If you're going to head downtown and pay for parking (see below) to eat at a trendy place, it has to excel. It has to wow you. It has to make you feel like it was worth the trip. To me, this was not a place I'd go out of my way to try again.

(A final kicker, there was Valet parking across the street for this place. When I picked up my car, I was *then* informed that it was $10. That's a tad bit shady, seeing as most places would..you know..advertise the price on the sign...I assumed it was complimentary parking)"}
{"text":"I enjoying coming here and sitting on the room top bar in the summer. This trip however I ate on the first floor at the meatball joint. I like the different combinations and variations of different ways you can get your balls. 

This visit I got the saucy balls. It came with 4 balls. A pair of beef and a pair of chicken. The beef was ok but the chicken was delicious. I also got a side of the parmesan broccoli. The broccoli was pretty good too. 

They have a large selection of drinks also. Some of there cocktails are a little pricey but definitely good. 

Our server was very knowledgeable of the food menu and drink menu and made lots of recommendations."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to grab a drink and dinner downtown. Emporio is a welcome addition to the Cultural District. 

Let's start with my favorite part--the draft list. Emporio boasts an excellent draft list, with an ever-changing list of local and distant breweries. On my last trip, I grabbed a Southern Tier 2X IPA. Good thing I wasn't driving. The draft and drink list is very reasonable, especially for being a trendy new spot downtown. 

The food menu is perfect for sharing and munching. The spot is known for its meatballs, and you can choose from many different sauces, meats, and presentations. I'm liable to make some kind of Frankenstein meal when left to mix and match on my own, but the servers are so helpful with recommendations. Each visit, I've deferred to them and had such a great meal. 

Beyond the meatballs are other great dishes for sharing. I am a big fan of the buffalo chicken balls. It sounds fairly nasty to me, but these deep fried, deconstructed buffalo chicken balls are fantastic. They come with a blue cheese sauce, and spiral-ized celery. It's a wonderful take on a bar classic, and much of the menu trends in that direction. 

While it's a trendy spot, I've never had an issue walking in and getting a table at Emporio. I understand the restaurant  doesn't take reservations, but if you're worried, sign up with NoWait to get on the list before you arrive.  

There are a ton of great places to eat before or after a show in the Cultural District, and I'd add this one to the top of the roster. I think you'd even catch me going Downtown specifically for this place!"}
{"text":"Never had I ever imagine putting risotto with meatballs. My goodness, it was fantastic. On top of that...tarter tots with fried egg with cheese curd and chicken gravy, let's just say it was amazing! The meatballs are huge and freshly made. I didn't really care for the cheese curd on my poutine. I learned while in Pittsburgh, they put French fries or some sort of potato form in anything. I was there for a conferee and I recommended some people to Check this place out. They absolutely loved it as well. Customer service was great and knowledgeable about the food. The atmosphere makes you feel at home and it's not fancy at all. Price is great for what you are getting!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I've been there a number of times, with friends, with work colleagues, for just food, for a happy hour, and for a late evening drink. Each time, however, I've experienced really awful service. They're very strict about their seating rule - we had one colleague in a group of ten running late and they refused to seat any of us until he arrived. Just general hostess and wait staff were rude as well on other occasions. Food is not particularly enjoyable. There's not a lot of options beside the huge meatballs. Space is also very crowded and quite loud. This is not one I'd ever recommend to a friend, indeed, I'd encourage you to find some place else."}
{"text":"Rooftop Beer Garden with my wife and great friend of mine. Already had eaten dinner, so we were interested in checking out the beer garden on the 3rd floor.  

The Beer Garden is pretty cool with the retractable roof which was open on a beautiful summer night.  The place was packed on a Saturday night, but we were able to grab a table. Great view of downtown Pittsburgh skyline.  

Nice choice of draft beers on tap. I enjoyed a Bell's Summer Shandy, my buddy liked his IPA's, and my wife got her go-to beer, Yuengling.  We enjoyed the vibe, view, and brew!  We'll be back soon to try the restaurant, meatballs, and pizza, which we've heard are all delicious."}
{"text":"This review is for Emporio, the first floor restaurant in this building. My boyfriend and I enjoyed lunch here. We had wonderful service, the food came out quickly, and it was absolutely delicious! 

I give it a 5 star review because on top of everything, this restaurant has excellent gluten free service. I have celiac disease, and sometimes it's hard for me to eat out. But not here - everything on the menu is \"a la carte\" and extremely customizable. Each gluten free menu item is clearly marked, and they have a turkey parmesan meatball that is gluten free. I was worried at first that I would struggle to find a way to eat meatballs without having a sandwich, but our server was very knowledgeable about how the food was prepared and offered numerous suggestions for how to order the meatballs safely. I ended up ordering one turkey meatball over gluten free penne with the spinach almond pesto sauce. It was absolutely to die for! I also had a side of tomato risotto which was heavenly. So gluten avoiders, just tell your server, and they will help you come up with something delicious and safe to eat! 

My gluten-eating boyfriend had a grinder with the spicy pork meatballs, pork bolognese sauce, and smoked gouda cheese. He enjoyed his food so much, he barely spoke throughout the meal! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Don't roll in here if you have a Canadian driver's license.  

Won't let you in for a drink even if you're 45years old...."}
{"text":"Overpriced drinks and subpar food. Everytime I've tried their meatballs i've been underwhelmed, no matter the flavor. The rooftop bar is really nice, typically an older crowd and everybody kind of stays in their groups and doesn't mingle. It would be nice if they did their happy hour on the rooftop and not just at the bar inside the restaurant. Basically don't come here for food, come here if you want a low key classy night with friends and don't mind spending a little more"}
{"text":"I think we should start by just acknowledging that this place has three floors catering to three different menus and Italian based food. Visiting Pittsburgh for the first time for work we ran in there starving after hearing great reviews. We couldn't even make it to the second floor so we stuck to meatballs and boy we're we not disappointed 

Food: my coworker and I got fried pickles and a salad to start. I'm a lover of fried pickles and boy was I not let down by taste and portion size - let's top it off with their bacon ranch dipping sauce. I then got the saucy classic balls with their crack sauce (ranch and buffalo mixed together) over mashed potatoes. I think I saw heaven for a split second. My coworker got the saucy chicken balls with the spicy sauce over Brussels. She's not a huge meat eater but she consumed the whole thing in seconds, i'd say that's a good sign. 

Service: For how busy this restaurant was I'd say service was pretty fast. 

Atmosphere: the main floor was definitely pretty loud since there was a game going on. 

I'd definitely go back there just to try out the second floor pasta and see the third floor rooftop. Go Pittsburgh Go!"}
{"text":"Mezzo is a great spot if you know what you want and you come here for pizza and wine--if you want a draft beer, you have to get it from either the first or third floor of Sienna on a separate tab--so go in knowing that.  My husband was a little annoyed with this, and we ended up drinking water with our pizza and heading upstairs for after-dinner beers...a little awkward, but still fun.

The food itself is really great!  I have had better wood-fired pizza, but not in Pittsburgh.  You can tell the ingredients are fresh and the chef was creative with his combinations.  I would recommend this place for date night, but we still prefer Emporio, the meatball joint downstairs!"}
{"text":"A very cool concept.  Meatballs, meatballs and meatballs.  They offer a variety of meatballs with a variety of sauces.  I got my meatballs over mac and cheese.   Yum.   Their prices seem a little high for what you get but the vibe and service were both good."}
{"text":"Very loud & busy!  We had a drink on the top floor while waiting for our table on 1st (meatballs).  They call your phone when your table is ready. Great selection of beers- bar is a bright, open area with lots of seating.  The meatballs were tasty, though they all contain cheese- if you can't have dairy, you are out of luck!"}
{"text":"Liked this place but not loved.  Flavorful meatballs, portions pretty large.  I had buffalo chicken,  was a bit overkill with chicken burried inder pile of celery strips and meatballs soaked in blue cheese. Ricotta doughnut s where too dark and dough too dense for my taste."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend and her Mom when we were downtown for an afternoon.  The place had a trendy hipster type of feel to it.  The first floor was all meatball orders (that's what we had).  Second floor was pizza and the third which you had to take an elevator up to was a beer garden.  

We all ordered the meatball sandwich and had some poutine with it.  The meatballs were pretty decent and they had a good selection of flavors and types to choose from.  Poutine was amazing and had some Parmesan cheese on it.  For dessert we split the doughnuts which came with a side of fudge.  These were incredible! Really warm and sweet finish to the meal.

Really neat place to go to.  I'd definitely go back if for nothing more than it is a cool place to be.  I believe they are opening another meatball shop up in Wexford so I'll have an option closer to home.  I'll be back sometime soon."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. We were celebrating divorces and an engagement for friends and the waitress ruined our entire evening. First, the air conditioner leaked on my newly engaged friend! Then, we moved and ordered dinner and were cut off prior to ordering drinks. My friend chipped her tooth on a meatball and was quite upset. After that, the waitress sent the bouncer over who laughingly had no explanation for asking us to leave aside from the waitress disliking us. Could this restaurant be any worse??"}
{"text":"Meatball mania!  If you aren't a fan of meatballs this isn't the place for you!  Food is served fast and the prices aren't that bad considering they are located in the heart of the Cultural District."}
{"text":"Stopped by Emporio for dinner after the Pens game on Saturday. Delicious!! The meatballs were wonderful. I got the spicy pork over risotto with Parmesan cheese sauce, and my boyfriend got the spicy pork over mac and cheese with marinara. Huge portions too, we took half home for lunch the next day. I will be going here again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Before dragging my husband to the Home & Garden show at the Convention Center today, I thought having a tasty lunch beforehand might put him in a better mood. After hearing about the new Sienna Mercato Emporio, I knew that we had to check it out.

I don't often dish out 5 star reviews for restaurants, particularly after the first try. However, the food here was AMAZING!!! Between my husband and me, I was able to try two meatballs (Classic Beef and Spicy Pork), three sauces (Creamy Parmesan, Mushroom Gravy, and Tzatziki), and two sides (Penne and Mac & Cheese). Everything was absolutely incredible! I could pour the Creamy Parmesan sauce on almost any food, and the Tzatziki sauce was a perfect combination with the Spicy Pork meatball.

In addition to incredible food, the service was very good, and the decor was modern and trendy. I cannot wait for the 2nd and 3rd floors of Sienna Mercato to open, Mezzo (pizza and wine) and Il Tetto (rooftop beer garden). I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with great staff.  Food was delicious and service was very good.

I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Having three different levels to their business is amazing! My boyfriend and I have been on all three levels. Sienna Is on the rooftop and is absolutely beautiful. Great selection of beer and great atmosphere. Only issue is the service, if you do not go to the bar, I have noticed it takes a while to get service at a table."}
{"text":"Okay people, so by now we all get the setup, right? Three floors, three different concepts (meatball (Emporio), pizza (Mezzo), and rooftop bar (Il Tetto)). I've had the opportunity to visit all three levels and have loved my experience at each.

The rooftop bar is absolutely lovely on a nice day. It has plenty of seating, a fantastic view overlooking Penn Ave, and delicious and interesting drinks. Unfortunately, the later in the night it gets, the more crowded it becomes, until pretty soon you're literally rubbing shoulders with random people around you. Unless you enjoy getting intimately familiar with increasingly drunk strangers, I'd recommend visiting Il Tetto earlier in the evening rather than later.

As for Mezzo, they serve upscale pizzas. On my particular visit, my friends and I shared the Quattro Fromaggi and Margherita pizzas. Both were incredibly tasty and well-seasoned with plenty of fresh cheese and a slightly sweet crust that was a perfect balance of crispy and chewy. They use high quality ingredients in their pies and it definitely shows. 

Of the three levels, my favorite is Emporio. It's the most casual of the three (although I'd still classify all three levels as fairly casual, just trendy). This level focuses on meatballs and sides. It's essentially a build-your-own kinda thing where you can choose from a variety of meatball types, pick your sauce, and then choose how you want them to be served (i.e., single slider, two meatballs on a panini, three meatballs on a grinder, or four meatballs served over a side dish). Not being a huge meat eater, I opted for their vegetarian meatball served panini style (two meatballs smashed with cheese) with the spinach-almond pesto sauce. My husband tried the spicy pork meatball panini with arribiata sauce. Then we split mac n' cheese and tomato risotto as sides. The food was absolutely delicious! Interestingly, they don't serve the sauce on the panini itself...rather, they give you a bowl of it on the side....or rather, they give you a small trough of it! I had more than enough sauce for dipping my panini with at least a half cup leftover to just straight up shotgun if I was so inclined. The paninis looked a little small and unimpressive upon first glance, but the meatballs are quite large and dense (even the veggie ones). It definitely was more than enough to fill us up. The veggie meatball isn't quite the same texture as a regular meatball (it was a little mushy), but it had excellent flavor and paired really well with the pesto sauce. My husband reported that his spicy pork balls paired nicely with his arribiata sauce as well. And as for the side dishes, they were both winners. The mac n' cheese was creamy and sharp....just how I like it. And the tomato risotto was perfectly executed...slightly al dente, creamy, a little sweet, and a little cheesy. Both sides were a great complement to our paninis. We left stuffed to the gills and quite happy.

Note that Mezzo takes reservations, but Emporio does not. Both do use the NoWait app though, which is quite handy since this place is popular and usually commands a wait on the weekends. I'd give it three thumbs up (one for each level) if I had an extra to spare, but two thumbs will have suffice."}
{"text":"What an amazing find during my short stay in Pittsburgh. 
Here's how it works: Sienna Mercato is actually 3 separate restaurants, separate menus, AMAZING food, all under one roof. It doesn't get better than that.

On the ground floor is Emporio, known as the \"meatball joint\", and for good reason. These guys know exactly what they're doing, not only with the meatballs, but with their sides and sauces as well. As a first-timer, the menu seemed a little daunting. They essentially allow you to choose your main - either the \"saucy balls\", a selection of 4 of their meatballs, with a choice of sauce over your choice of side(s) or a choice of meatballs in some sandwich-y form, sauce and a side. This may sound simple enough, but all the possible combinations of meatball/sauce/side makes choosing difficult. After much hemming and hawing, and with some help from both hostesses and our waiter, I finally decided on an order of Saucy Balls. I chose the chicken meatballs, with chicken gravy over a side of crispy parm brussel sprouts (my other choice was the chicken meatballs with government cheese over mac and cheese). And when it arrived, it was better than I thought it would be... because, really, how good can meatballs really get? Let me tell you: these fine chefs at Emporio really know their balls. But the real surprise? The BRUSSEL SPROUTS. A close second to my absolute favourite sprouts from San Francisco, and THAT is saying something (those sprouts from SF can be found at North 49 in Burlingame, close to SFO, and are one of my favourite things to eat in the entire world). My only complaint is that once the chicken meatballs and gravy were all done, the sprouts on their own were quite salty (probably due in large part to the pile of parmesan that came with it) and I was unable to finish it. The colleagues I dined with also had the meatball of the month (pepperoni) with the mac & cheese and the Loaded Baked Potato Bowl (beef balls, mashed potatoes and tater tots with government cheese sauce), and all their plates were licked clean! We enjoyed our dinner here so much that a couple nights later, we returned to try...

Mezzo, on the second floor of Mercato - charcuterie and wood-fired pizza, but their selection really included a \"finer\" dining than their sister resto downstairs. Much like my experience on the ground floor, I had a hard time choosing from the menu, everything sounded so good. But the good people at Mezzo have a solution for this dilemma: for $35, you can choose something from their \"small/medium\" (appetizer/salad/antipasti) section of the menu, something from their \"large\" (main) section and it all includes dessert. As recommended by our waitress, I got the Ricotta Gnudi to start, the Boneless Pork Chop and the Chocolate Hazelnut Marjolaine for dessert. The gnudi (ricotta cheese coated in breadcrumb and an apple butter) was okay. I wish I had gone with my gut and ordered the Frutti di Mare instead. My colleague ordered the Salmon Tartare and RAVED about it. But even if he hadn't, his clean plate said it all. The dessert was also just okay, and somewhat disappointing... but the pork chop that arrived in between...THAT was delicious. Easily the best pork chop I've had in a long time. Possibly because I don't typically like pork chop. But this? This was GOOD. The ramp pesto was unexpectedly the highlight of the dish. Highly recommended.

The icing on the cake? Both servers (Anish from Emporio, Emily from Mezzo) as well as the bartender, whose name I didn't get, but mixed me up an AMAZING non-alcoholic drink were all STELLAR. I couldn't recommend Siena Mercato more, either restaurant would be great. (We didn't visit the beer garden on the top, for lack of time, but looking at the menu seems like a small combination of appetizers from both restaurants and drinks)."}
{"text":"Great food. Untill it gives everyone at your table who ate the pork meatballs food poisoning.Not worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for a weekend visit to Pittsburgh and they completely spoiled our night. Turns out, unlike the entire state of PA, they don't accept international passports (or Indian, in our case). Even a valid US visa with photo and date of birth was insufficient. Trying to reason with them was impossible owing to the stubbornness of the management. All this made worse considering we were waiting for a table for 20 minutes.

Thoroughly disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ben is an awesome bar tender, great old fashioned and late night happy hour -- awesome"}
{"text":"I give this restaurant maybe a 2.5 stars. We went on a Wednesday night around 10pm and there was a nice amount of people in there. We sat in a booth in the bar area on the main level which is the Emporio. This is the meatball joint. The pasta level was already closed... So we ordered meatballs with spaghetti and some with penne. My husband ordered risotto and did not care for it. To me the flavor and color reminded me of Spaghettio's. They have different styles of meatballs and we had the special, which consisted of pork, rolled with pieces of pepperoni and parm cheese and the second style was spicy pork. I liked the spicy pork better. The noodles are gluten free and we didn't care for the texture or taste. Our waitress was kind but she didn't check on us often. We had to ask a different waitress for almost everything we needed. They also give a carafe with water, but do not ask if you want ice or even a straw. After I asked for that she brought a larger glass with water but never provided refills. So I kept refilling my glass from the carafe, but by the end of our meal the ice was melted from the room temp water! Overall it was a mediocre experience including the food. We will not return."}
{"text":"I've gone to Mercato a few times and have never had a bad meal! It's a great place to go with friends, order a ton of food and just share everything. The idea of a restaurant focused on meatballs sounds a little dumb and I'm not sure the staying power that this restaurant will have. But, for now, I'm more than happy getting my fill of mushroom arincini while I can! The service itself has never been bad when I've gone and everything has been consistent."}
{"text":"A trendy and popular restaurant in downtown. The hosts struggled at the beginning - skipping us and giving tables to a party after us - but more than made up for it by treating us to a round of drinks. Thank you, Manager!

Food was excellent, especially the pork risotto. However, the margherita pizza needed  much less tomato sauce and much more mozzarella.

I recommend, especially if hanging around downtown and want quality drinks with quality and rich food."}
{"text":"The meatballs are amazing, which is good because thats all they sell. But they have so many different options for meat, sauces, and if you want the meatball alone or on a bun etc. There are also wonderful soup and salad options as well as a great draft list. You can also go upstairs while you are waiting on this level, but the drinks are pricey. Overall the food is delicious, and I would go back again."}
{"text":"I'd scoped this place out on the weekend as a spot to check out for dinner with my work team and we had a great night out! Service was wonderful and both the Maitre'd plus wait staff were wonderful!

I decided to make my own bowl of meatballs and tried x2 veggies, 1 chicken as 1 Pork with basil sauce and spaghetti. I think that was too heavy for me as next time I might try it as a meatball sub and also hopefully get some greens at the same time! 

One one of my co-workers got the saut√©ed Brussels Sprouts - I found these to be well cooked but unfortunately they tasted bitter to me as well.

For dessert, our table of 11 got the beignets plus the red velvet cake mini- donuts. For me the clear Winn was the beignets - I could have licked clean the accompanying bowl of chocolate sauce! In contrast the red velvet tasted a bit heavy and stodgy.

Overall a brilliantly good night out - I'm now anxious to try out the food on Floors #2 and #3!

Yelp Review 57/2017"}
{"text":"The first floor (meatball joint) is a great lunch option! As a vegetarian, there are still plentiful options of vegetarian meatballs which are to die for!  And on Monday's there is a \"Meatball Monday\" special that is definitely worth a try!

The second floor is also great.  The pizza's are huge and are displayed on the tables using old Marinara Sauce cans... great way to reuse and recycle! I've also tried the Mushroom Risotto, Roasted Beets, and all of the different salads! All are tasty and the right amount of savory and healthy!  

Finally, the beer garden.  This is a great spot in the summer when the windows are open! But even in the midst of a snow storm the bar is still super crowded and the roof is a great spot to hang out with friends, people watch, and try craft beers! There is also a small food menu offered.

Great place to take guests from out of town! And maybe you'll see a Pens player dining there! (I've seen a few in my time :) )"}
{"text":"Had the pepperoni fritters they were really good! Bar staff could be a bit more attentive but the food came out very fast. Downside these are the most uncomfortable bar stools I've ever sat on. They're cute though..."}
{"text":"The place looks as though it does well.  Tons of diversity in the crowd.  The food was mediocre, the place was loud and cramped.  I will definitely be returning to try their pizza and roof-top.  Nothing special about the meatballs though.  Maybe I caught them on a bad night.  
Deep fried pickles were runny a little too greasy."}
{"text":"Review for Mezzo:

It's really hard to write a review based on our experience at just one of the spots but here goes. We arrived around 9:15 pm knowing that the kitchens closed for the evening at 10 pm. We decided to go to the rooftop beer garden but once we realized they only served bar snacks (also only until 10 pm) we went to Mezzo instead. Even though there is an elevator for all 3 floors we had to take the elevator from the 3rd floor to 1st floor and then take a flight of steps to the 2nd floor ( i wish it had been clear that the 1nd floor was only accessible by stairs somewhere.) When we sat down and looked at the menu the options seemed great. I ordered the baby spinach salad and the small plate risotto, my brother ordered the gnocchi (also a starter) and my sister ordered the arugula salad. I loooved my salad it had roasted pecans, goat cheese and was dressed with just the right amount and had a great flavor. My risotto on the other hand was so disappointing - I would compare the risotto to like a macaroni salad you would serve at a BBQ  - in taste and texture. It was heavy with cream but not in a good way almost tasted like mayo and the texture of it was really off putting like lumpy.  My brother knew ahead of time that he was ordering a starter but the serving size of the gnocchi was really small - for $8 he got like 10 pieces of gnocchi but he really enjoyed it. My sister's salad was underdressed and she had to request more dressing. The service was amazing though, our waitress was attentive and the hostess was really nice. I would definitely come back here for drinks but I will not be returning to Mezzo - being a pescaratian and trying a lot of the items we could eat it really was just meh. Come here for the rooftop bar - not the food."}
{"text":"I ate at Emporio a couple of times before seeing shows in the Cultural District and it's usually pretty quick, so a good option if you're pressed for time.  I had the turkey meatballs and pesto, both delicious. The herb fries are really good and one order is more than enough to split with someone else. I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Marriott across the street and decided to try this restaurant prior to departing for the airport.  We were not disappointed.

There was immediate seating at the bar, which we prefer.  The bartender, Scott, was one of the best we had in Pittsburgh.  He was pleasant, knowledgeable, efficient and attentive.  

We decided to each have a salad and then split the Saucy Sampler.  I had the wedge salad and my husband had the house.  We both had the house Italian dressing which was excellent.  

As an aside, all of the items were served in stainless steel bowls that had two handles.  I liked them so much I ordered 8 of them online when I returned home.  A wedge salad on a dinner plate is hard to eat, but in these bowls, it was contained just right.

For the saucy sampler, we had three traditional meatballs and a chicken.  I loved the chicken and my husband loved the traditional.  The marinara sauce was excellent.  These meatballs, especially the traditional, would have been great with the brown gravy, too.

If you are craving meatballs, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Didn't eat here just grabbed a drink and had a huge selection of draft beer which we really enjoy. People around us said the meatballs were great."}
{"text":"Get the pesto sauce. I could just drink that. Never had anything bad here. Only thing is the wait. Be prepared to wait if you go on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Wonderful place we happened upon for lunch.  

All meatballs, all different kinds.  We didn't want anything especially heavy so we opted for salads each with one meatball.  I got a chicken while my husband got beef.  They were both extremely flavorful and the salads were so fresh and good.  

Our waiter was really great and explained everything to us.  

Their meatball of the day was a bacon cheeseburger, which sounded awesome but I was in a chicken mood.  

We will definitely go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Visited the newly opened Sienna Mercato for lunch.  I ate at Emporio, and had the Pork Meatballs with the Pork bolagnese sauce and it was delicious.  The pork was flavorful and had a little bit of a kick to it.  I wouldn't have minded some bread to mop up the sauce with, but unfortunately there wasn't any.  

For a sit down lunch, it was very quick service and shouldn't be a problem getting in and out in a reasonable amount of time.  

I would like to return for dinner as it looks like they have an extensive beer selection, and would like to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"WOW. Everything was fantastic: the concept, the atmosphere, the staff, the food, even down to the treats that come with the bill (delicious chocolate almond truffle cookies). 

We had dinner at the Mezzo (2nd floor) and ordered the calamari-- crisp, not the slightest bit chewy, with an herb-infused/caper aioli, olives-- the perfect amount of spice, the bread basket-- our waitress was really knowledgable and explained the variety of breads and spreads in detail, mesculun salad-- fresh, the pesto vinaigrette was to die for, and the quattro formaggi pizza-- the pickled tomato made for a unique sweet and acidic twist. We also ordered the spaghetti alla Vangole, but I was unable to give it a try, as I was absolutely stuffed already.

The menu is set up so that your table and order an assortment of dishes, the waitstaff will distribute plates/ appropriate serving ware, and everyone can sample the delectables.  I can't wait to bring my parents to Il Tetto (and hopefully follow the beers with a pizza downstairs...)"}
{"text":"OMG the beef meatball was so incredibly delicious. I recommend the panini sandwich with beef meatballs and arrabiatta sauce."}
{"text":"Meatball of the day!  Sliders.  Tater tots.  Great atmosphere.  Great layout.  Roof top bar with retractable roof.  Ok you will love it.   Rain or shine this place is fine.  Excellent diverse beer selection."}
{"text":"Outstanding!   What an awesome meal!  Great service, great atmosphere, outstanding food!  I ordered the Poutine for an appetizer (amazing), my friend got the matzo ball soup - he loved it...I got the chicken meat ball with cheese tortellini and pesto (to die for!) and then to top it off got the ricotta doughnuts with cream cheese icing - oh my god, they were the best doughnuts I have ever eaten!  Truly amazing.  Great local find!  Check it out- you won't regret!!!!   And by the way, I got a Moscow mule too...was great.  10 out of 10!"}
{"text":"I've gotten takeout from here a couple of times- it's ok. I've tried the Buffalo meatballs and Caesar salad and thought they were solid but not something I would go out of my way to try again."}
{"text":"I'm always impressed with the food on all 3 floors. The rooftop bar has a great view of the Pittsburgh skyscrapers, I love catching drinks with friends here. I've been here for a handful of Bachelorette parties (beginning of the evening- dinner, drinks), and they can accommodate larger parties without sacrificing quality."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a very good place with great atmosphere.  We sat on the meatball floor.  The whole concept of 3 different floors with 3 different experiences is a very intuitive idea.

I had the pork meatballs with pork bolognese or pasta and my girlfriend had the vegetarian meatballs with a side of quinoa.  Both of these entrees were a pleasure to eat.  They were very tasty and seasoned well.  The pork meatballs were tender and juicy, not dry.  The vegetarian meatballs had great spices in them.  They also have a nice beer selection.

I will most likely be returning here to try one of the other floors in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Sienna is the type of place you can recommend to anyone for a million & 1 different occasions and it'll hit the spot every time. Probably the busiest restaurant in Pittsburgh, and for very good reason. Great-tasting food, fair prices, and top-notch service.

Floor by floor breakdown:
Mezzo's great for more intimate gatherings. (Make a reservation!) For sure more of an adult vibe, but families come too. 

The roof, Il Tetto, is most definitely worth the wait, especially on a clear night. Drinks are great, good scene, fun people, what else could you want?

Emporio is all-around awesome. Perfect for the quick and easy business lunch, you can take the kids before a Pirates game, bar is fun, great prices, 30 beers on tap. We're big fans of bartender Scott... 10/10 on the drinks and bar knowledge. Risotto is superb. And it's always fun to try the special ball of the month. Cute little server girls are an added bonus."}
{"text":"I visited on a Tuesday night and it was relatively uncrowded. I love the industrial design of the restaurant-the \"garage door\" opens when the weather is nice too. We were greeted immediately upon walking in and The hostess seating us gave a very good overview of the menu, filled our water glasses, and left the carafe on the table (which I always like). Service started off shaky-we were waiting for a good 10 minutes when our server came over and apologized for the wait, thanked us for being patient, and added she was having a computer issue and couldn't find anyone to help her. Having worked in food service before, I'm very understanding and wasn't bothered by this as I've had the same issue. She took our drink order and those were promptly brought to our table (I had the Boulder Mojo a nitro IPA and my boyfriend had an Old Brown Ale). They have a decent draft selection-lots of IPAs which I love. Most are between $5.50-$7 so typical Pittsburgh prices. We started off with the buffalo fried chicken balls with blue cheese and celery. The celery was shredded and blended with the blue cheese which topped the fried chicken balls. They were delicious-had a definite kick to them-and there were 6 balls so it was perfect for sharing. For our entrees we both decided to do 2 sliders (since you can't do multiple types of meatballs in any of the serving options-that was my one negative). We both did a meatball of the day slider. The meatball of the day was a ground beef/corned beef mix topped with saurkraut and stone ground mustard. WOW! It was perfectly pink in the middle-how I like it-and the flavors blended together perfectly! My boyfriend chose a spicy pork slider with Arribiatta sauce which he said was very good. I chose a chicken meatball with the tzatziki sauce and again-WOW! The tzatziki sauce was probably the best I've ever had and I really liked the flavors in the chicken meatball. After that hiccup in the beginning, service was great-we were checked on at exactly the right points during our visit, our glasses were always full, after we finished the plates were immediately cleared. She was very talkative and friendly and made a great suggestion on the Boulder mojo I had. We had a great experience from start to finish (minus that hiccup with waiting for our server at first) so do not hesitate to make your way down to Emporio for some delicious meatballs-we will absolutely be back for a return visit."}
{"text":"Just had an absolutely terrible experience at Sienna Mercato. Just terrible. This one is on you, general manager Krista Koller. 100% on you. 

A friend had arranged to hold an after party for their wedding here. The guests (about 30 of us) got there around midnight and got some drinks in the upstairs beer garden while waiting for the bride and groom to arrive. When they arrived just before 1am and the general manager, Krista Koller, wouldn't let them in because they didn't have their IDs on them. It's the wedding day, and quite understandable that in the midst of everything they forgot to carry their IDs. Wedding dresses usually don't have pockets. Remember that this is the bride and groom - the couple that had organized to have their party here in the first place. Let alone the facts that this is their wedding day and that these individuals are clearly over 21 (two facts that by themselves any sensible, reasonable manager should consider), the fact that she refused to allow the people who organized the event to enter the event is insane! What kind of person is this? Sienna Mercato, you seem like a decent establishment, but if this is the kind of people you have running the place then forget it. There are tons of great places in Pittsburgh, and I'll go to the places that have reasonable human beings with at least some sense of decency running the show.

I mean, seriously...on their wedding day...really? REALLY? You're going to be that much of a jerk to a newly wed couple? What is wrong with you Krista Koller?"}
{"text":"Came in the early evening to grab a light dinner. The food, environment, and service was superb!

Things I liked:
- great selection small plates to choose from. We ordered calamari over a savory spread (almond, cashews, maybe tomato among other delicious mystery ingredients), burrata with a balsamic reduction, and pork meatballs with endive and radicchio. The sauce paired with meatballs was incredible! 
- great selection of drinks
- bar seating was ample, clean, service was phenomenal
- very friendly atmosphere

Things I didn't like:
-  the meatballs were a bit dry and dense, but the flavor was definitely there, so I would have liked a different texture with the flavor profiles in this dish, or perhaps not served in meatball form...idk I didn't go to culinary school I just eat

Overall I'm hopeful to return to see what else they have to serve! Their charcuterie sounds amazing, as well as their pizza menu!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at the second floor of sienna and it was absolutely wonderful. Our server was very attentive and friendly. They have an amazing deal where you can pick a small/medium dish+large dish+dessert for only $35! It's a lot of food and enough for two people to share. We got the arugula salad, the seafood pasta and for dessert the peanut butter and chocolate terrine. We also go the butchers meat charcuterie. We also decided to get a second dessert-the name which I forget-but was like a brownie souffl√©! Everything was SO delicious! My only complaint was one of the workers who kept coming by too often trying to take plates away before we even finished eating. By the third time she came by, when we hesitated to hand over our meals which we were still eating, she made an annoyed face! Finally we decided to give up and just give her our half eaten plates. Other than the over zealous employee taking away our food too soon, everything else was great!"}
{"text":"Meatball and fried rice is amazing! however the waiting line to the top floor is rediculous"}
{"text":"It's ok because everyone wants to try it, ppl love a theme. Decent food but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"So reasonably priced, so many options, so much flavor, and such great service! Essentially, you get to build your own meatball - you pick a meat (or the vegetarian option), the way you want it served, and the sauce. 

I ordered a chicken meatball slider with arribiatta sauce, which is simply a spicier marinara sauce, and the rocket salad. At a low price of $3.50, the slider was phenomenal; the bread was soft, the meatball was incredibly juicy and well seasoned, and there was just enough sauce to not drown out the flavors of the meatball. The salad was also great, as the arugula was fresh and the balsamic vinaigrette paired well with the mozzarella and almonds on top. The meal wasn't too heavy and left me feeling perfectly satisfied without feeling like I was going to experience a food coma. I loved how flexible the menu is and how accommodating the staff is - you get your food exactly the way you want it. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Oh my word I love their balls! Ok I got that out of my system but woah. Started off with the matzo ball soup, and it was so good I could have put my face in the bowl. I mean I could eat this soup every day and never get tired of it. 
I have the vegetarian ball slider with taziki sauce and Chris had the spicy pork meatballs with creamy Parmesan sauce on the panini. Have you ever been to a restaurant where everything that comes out of the kitchen tastes similar? Well not here! These two sandwiches couldn't have been more different and it was awesome! The taziki was light and fresh with lots of yummy lemon and the texture of the veggie ball was wonderfully silky smooth. Chris's sandwich was hearty, spicy, and perfect for a chilly day. Just loaded with so much flavor. 
Our service was awesome and I really like the vibe here. Very warm and welcoming. They have a great selection of beers as well. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Get reservations because it was crowded on a Tuesday night.  We started out at the bar on the first floor and checked out the meatball menu.  Man, am I glad I didn't have a meatball starter and saved room for dinner. I was tempted though because those meatballs smell delicious!  And they had gluten-free turkey meatballs!
We had dinner in the 2nd floor. Same interior with exposed brick. Not a lot of soft surfaces so the noise level is loud on both floors.  Wood seating around.
I had the butternut risotto at the pretty server's suggestion. The  1/2 portion was plenty! I had the pork with polenta very good, cooked perfectly.
I also had the mixed green salad with the candied pecans with a lite vinegar dressing and blue cheese. All my dinner was excellent. I really enjoyed the Melbec wine I had.
I had a gluten intolerance which the waitress had no problem helping me with. There was really no GF desserts which was fine because I was full even though I went splitzy on my dinner with my daughter.
My pal had the pork risotto, not as good as mine. It was kind of heavy seasoning with thyme sage ...  Another person had the pizza which I heard no complaints. Another in our party got the escarole salad, he seemed to enjoy.  Total check for two with wine around $100
I would like to check out the beer garden on the roof level - it looks pretty from the outside and it was open which is great as its November but the temp is in the 60s"}
{"text":"Had the spicy pork meatball sandwich for lunch here and it was quite tasty. It came with a nice marinara dipping sauce. I would like to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent experience all around. When going out for dinner or drinks downtown this is the place to be."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I love the idea of the focus on meatballs.  The menu allows for a variety of ways to have your meatballs, such as on sliders, just by themselves, or on top of poutine.  They say you can't \"mix your balls\" but they do allow you to buy them a la carte for a little more money then you can mix all you want!  I went twice and got a few different meatballs with different sauces I mixed and matched.  They each came out in individual little bowls.  I got beef, pork, chicken, and vegetarian with a variety of sauces.  And each day they also have a special meatball of the day.  They were all amazing, even the vegetarian one that I had with a delicious pesto sauce.  I also really enjoyed the mac-n-cheese and poutine (available with pancetta and a fried egg on top!).  The atmosphere is trendy with a good vibe and now that the weather is nice they have the front wall opened up to the outside which is really nice.  They had a great draft beer list and half off drafts during happy hour 4-6.  Service was excellent.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Give me the meatballs all day long here. Was in Pittsburgh for business - and this spot was recommended. Right around the corner from the Westin hotel at the Convention Center. Italian Wedding Soup, Meatballs/Pasta/Marinara and three Peroni's for less than $35 with tip. Get there."}
{"text":"Walked by this place during my afternoon stroll. Wished I had yelped it prior to wondering around the area bc I would have stopped in for lunch. Returned to my room and yelped a few places and saw the menu items here. I am a lover of meatballs so I had to visit. Again, I strolled down a few streets and found this place. There were many people waiting for tables. I opted for a seat at the bar. The bartender greeted me and I asked for a Blue Moon. She recommend a local brew that was fantastic. She also helped me order my entree, which was balls in gravy over mac n cheese. It was tasty. Overall, I'm glad I visited and would return if in the area again."}
{"text":"SETTING:
Dimly lit, with a brick wall backdrop donning the Sienne Mercato logo. Pretty snazzy atmosphere. You can go casual or take it up a notch.

FOOD:
\"A meatball joint\".  Emporio is a unique place that specializes in meatballs. 
Step 1: choose a type of meatball (I liked beef; the pork was a little chewy and tough)
Step 2: choose sauce 
Step 3: choose how you want it served (on a slider, panini, etc)

These meatballs are the size of a baby's fist! NOT the size of a typical meatball found in your spaghetti. 

Let's do some simple math: 2 meatball sliders + 1 side/appetizer is a perfect amount. Believe me, I thought I would still be hungry with this order, but it was definitely more than enough. 2 densely packed meatballs + 1 side/appetizer of heavy carbs = a bloated stomach. 

SERVICE:
There are no reservations, so you need to wait it out. Best advice is to come early or late and not during peak dining times unless you can wait 30+ minutes. Service overall was average, nothing that was above and beyond. 

IMPRESSIONS:
If you are looking for a heavy meal and/or like meatballs, you want to check this place out.  I mean, how many places specialize in big meatballs?!  I enjoyed the beef meatball with the arribiatta sauce served on a slider--soft and delicate, like a meatball should be. The spicy pork was a bit too chewy and tough, so I would not recommend it. Mac and cheese as my slide was awesome, and you can't go wrong with any of the sides. It really is a heavy meal though, so come hungry!"}
{"text":"Saucy Balls!!  Oh how I love thee... let me count the ways!  OK, I won't count them but I will be back for more of your meatball-y goodness!

Before a trip to The Paint Can (AKA a hockey game) we stopped at Empirio for some balls.  Beef, Turkey, Sausage, and many other delicious kinds of meatballs, sauces, and ways to eat them.  Combine the balls with a solid tap list of craft beer, everyone was happy. 

I opted for the ball of the month: turkey meatballs with mushroom gravy over mashed potatoes and corn.  There may have been cranberry in there too... OH EM GEE!!  Now THIS is a Thanksgiving feast!!  

Who needs a thanksgiving dinner of dry turkey, canned cranberry, or cranky relatives when you can go to Empirio and order this amazing dish?!  The only thing that would make it better would be if I was enjoying it in my sweats while watching football... but I bet Empirio and I could work something out. 

Oh ya - everyone else enjoyed their food, too.  

Empirio and I are now in a relationship.  The hubs understands and is supportive of my desire to indulge in delicious meatballs... he even joins in!  Our marriage is now even better"}
{"text":"Amazing vegan options, which was surprising for a meatball joint. Portions aren't huge, staff is friendly, great outdoor rooftop."}
{"text":"Amazing food? Check.  Great staff? Check
 Killer location? Check . 

They know what they are doing and every floor is another great adventure!"}
{"text":"I would strongly recommend Sienna Mercato, Everything from the meatballs to the pizza was perfectly cooked and the entire staff was very nice."}
{"text":"This review is for Mezzo, the wine and pizza bar contained within the same building as Sienna Mercato. Mezzo doesn't have it's own listing, so I had to post here!

We arrived here on a Saturday night around 6:30pm with no reservation, hoping we were early enough so that the wait wouldn't be too long. Luckily we were able to snag a very comfy seat at the bar and we're greeted promptly by an extremely friendly bartender who hooked us up with water and menus while still pumping out drinks to other patrons. 

With some helpful input from our bartender, we decided on the mussels as a starter and the crispy skate wing dish, as well as the bacon and clam pizza. He timed things pretty wonderfully. My favorite fish was the mussels. I'm not the biggest fan of tomato sauce, but the sauce these huge mussels were floating in was rich and somewhat creamy and was pretty fantastic. They came with huge slices of grilled bread to sop up the sauce. My only complaint was that I didn't have more bread to enjoy the sauce with. 

My SO enjoyed the pizza the best and I thought it was just okay. There was a bit too much of the clam flavor and not enough of the bacon flavor going on. We both liked the flavor of the skate, but I thought it a bit too acidic with the amount of capers that were in the dish. I'm glad I tried it--it was good--but I wouldn't order it again. NOT WITH ALL THOSE AMAZING MUSSELS TO BE HAD!

One of my favorite parts of the whole experience was the ambiance. The second floor looked like some cool converted loft and the lighting was nothing short of rom-com romantic. Overall I had a good experience and look forward to trying them again sometime."}
{"text":"Review for : Il Tetto

Went here on a warm Friday for happy hour. Had the peach slushy drink and it was fabulous and reasonable for $5. The space is so cool but became easily overcrowded and hard to hear. I'm not sure if the glass windows above normally open up but since they were closed I think that trapped the sound a bit 

I also wish that you didn't need to reserve and table to sit/ there was more seating for those who are just there for drinks. It was difficult to get the attention of a bar tender so we were awkwardly standing behind people sitting at the bar for a good 15 minutes trying to order drinks"}
{"text":"Place is awesome. Great atmosphere and great food. Had the 4 meatball plate we meat sauce and spaghetti."}
{"text":"It was a little overcrowded when I went and was a bit expensive. Wouldn't pick it over other restaurants or bars in the same area."}
{"text":"Emporio is always a great experience. Honestly, I come to this restaurant because the food is good but the inside is great! When it's warmer out, the wall closest to Penn is open to view the outdoors. The inside has this cool urban vibe that's good to experience after a long day at work or if you have friends visiting the city from out of town. It's got that \"wow\" factor that's good for those visiting guests. 

The food itself is good albeit a touch overpriced in my book. But, you can order different varieties of meatballs and sauces and sides. Probably expect to pay around $40 for 2 people when coming here. Although the meals aren't huge, I will say, they are filling. My wife and I often each get the meatball panini and two sides. That's a good meal option. We like the mac and cheese and the broccoli for sides. Definitely get the mac and cheese. Broccoli . . . Who messes that up? Really? No one. So, it's good. 

The waiters are nice but the pace is quick. I like that the quick pace but others may be overwhelmed by it. The waiters are always willing and great to answer questions, though. So, don't panic. 

Want a great place to eat in the city that's unique, filled with great vibes and energy, and won't break the bank? Sienna Mercato's Emporio is a terrific option!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Sienna Mercato in general but for me my favorite is Emporio, the meatballs are delicious and personally I'm a big fan of the risotto as well. My go to meal is two turkey meatball sliders, one with the pesto sauce and the other with the government cheese then a side of the tomato risotto and a nice cold beer. Could eat that every day.

I've only been to Mezzo once so far and was a fan but think I need to go again to really solidify my opinion. The meat and cheese plate was a wonderful assortment and the pizza I had was quite good. The wine selection is also impressive.

Il Tetto is the place to go after your meal, it's an amazing place to have a drink and look at the sky with the glass roof or when it's nice they have it open. The food is more snack food but it's definitely high level bar food with bruschetta, fried brussel sprouts and of course the cheese plate.

Overall the space is amazing on all three floors and you really can't go wrong by going there for a night on the town, a special occasion dinner or even just casual. You can always find what you're looking for."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing.  The staff including our waiter, Keaton and his manager, JP were so helpful in recommending drinks, dinner and dessert. We felt very welcome and we're able to stay a long time to catch up with old friends.  I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Went to the bar on the bottom level after pickle feast. The food was great and the meatballs are delicious. The drinks were also good, but they took forever to get, even with the bar half empty. The female bartender seemed very annoyed to be waiting on us. She gave us menus, and started cutting lemons on the other side of the bar. We tried to get her attention when she was walking around the bar, but she just ignored us and kept her eyes down. She never came back to get our drink or food orders, until I asked the male bartender if we could order. This continued the rest of the time we were there. Finally the male bartender took over our service which was a relief. Overall I think the place is cool, but our service was terrible."}
{"text":"The rooftop beer garden was a cool hangout while we waited for our table at Emporio, glass roof, nice view and atmosphere. Emporio was excellent, the meatballs were great, especially the spicy pork with the Arribiatta sauce was the highlight! The appetizer of poutine was excellent as well. Other winners were the beef meatballs with the traditional sauce."}
{"text":"I was worried about coming here because I don't eat a lot of meat but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw they also have veggie balls! 

For those of you who haven't been here, you basically pick the type of \"ball\" and what sauce you want and decide if you want it on a sandwich, hoagie, on pasta or just plain in a dish referred to as \"saucy balls.\" They have salads and other apps too. 

Wedding soup was okay but nothing to write home about. I will definitely get the veggie balls again which I enjoyed with the tzatziki sauce. The husband enjoyed the pork balls and father-in-law loved the beef balls on a hoagie. 

Only wish the rooftop bar was open when we were there! It doesn't open until late afternoon."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner here! I wandered over since it was across the street from my hotel after reading great reviews, and because my hotel window looked upon the rooftop bar.

My friend and I were told the bottom floor was meatballs, the second floor was pizza and other \"Italian plates\", and the rooftop bar was drafts, appetizers and bar food. We decided on the first  floor for meatballs.

Our waiter was knowledgable and friendly, as were the women sitting next to us (who were regulars). I ended up ordered \"saucy balls\" which came with 4 balls and a choice of sauce, and a salad. I had two chicken, one veggie and one beef with creamy Parmesan sauce. All the meatballs were incredible, and the sauce was so good I ate it alone with my fork. My friend also ordered the saucy balls with the \"arrabatta\" (??) sauce atop Parmesan fries. 

I also ordered the \"salty dog\" cocktail, which was vodka, fresh (or fresh tasting) grapefruit juice and a salted rim with crushed ice. It was very good.

Overall great food, quick service, but a lot pricier than I anticipated. I would definitely check out the other floors if I'm in the city again."}
{"text":"Okay, love this place. All three floors have different menus and I think that's very cool. We first had a few beers at the rooftop bar. The lights, being surrounded by the city and the summer evening weather set the tone for a great night. Service was fast and the hostess was very accommodating. We had dinner on the first floor which has a menu of meatballs. Being vegetarian I've never had meatballs but when I saw veggie meatballs I had to see why this was a menu item. Holy. Moly. The veggie meatballs did not disappoint and I wish I had at least one extra stomach so I could've kept eating. It was so good!!! The pesto almond sauce was bomb and complimented the veggie meatball with provolone perfectly. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice. I can't say enough how delicious this dinner was. I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Waiter helped us understand the menu. I normally wouldn't have considered a restaurant where the menu revolves around meatballs but everything we ordered was delicious. Pleasant surprise. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Holy meatballs!!  My husband and I went to Sienna Mercato for our first Mommy-Daddy date night.  We LOVED it.  We checked in at the Meatball Emporium and then headed up to the Rooftop Beer Garden.  The beer selection was great- I had Great Lake's Chillwave, the perfect summery, rooftoppy drink.  The roof is simple - a glass roof, some twinkle lights, and a view of the Cultural District.  A great hang out and awesome waiting spot for your table downstairs.  

Down in the emporium we enjoyed the same great beer list and some amazing meatballs - we did the buffalo appetizer - spicy and addicting...but let's be honest, all the meatballs were addicting.  I elected to do three different sliders and while full forced myself to finish each delectable bite. The atmosphere is busy but in a fun way.  

TIP- they're a part of this app called NoWait- it's like call ahead seating.  I recommend using it if you'll be going during busy times."}
{"text":"Concept vs. execution. Love the idea of a meatball-specific establishment in downtown Pittsburgh, but can meatballs alone make it? Thank goodness two more floors are still set to open, each with their own focus. Not that the meatballs weren't good....they were good, just not great. Not enough to bring me back for anything but a quick lunch.

Speaking of execution, they have the style part down pat. My dining companion and I each ordered spicy pork meatballs because they were gluten-free once our server clued us in to that fact. Score! However, the menu says it's the chicken meatballs that are gluten-free - poor execution of the menu. I wasn't disappointed since the spicy pork meatballs sounded much more tempting! (Just fix the menu, please,before someone accidentally orders the chicken meatballs and suffers a reaction. I'd think it would be a pretty simple fix to place stickers on the menu until new menus are printed.) 

Anyway, back to the balls. Great flavor, nice spice and heavy as a solid rubber ball. Still, I'd order them again....and not just because it's the only one on the menu that's gluten-free.

Sauces. I ordered my balls with the Sunday sauce and a side of tomato risotto. My dining partner had hers with the arabbiata sauce and a side of beans and greens. The presentation was quite nice for a dish of humble meatballs. A silver dish with 4 nice size meatballs carressed by a silken red sauce on top of my side dish of risotto. What? Wish I'd realized they automatically put your balls on top of your side. I'd prefer my risotto unadulterated, please. The sauce was decent, just not what I've ever considered Sunday sauce. Where was the meat? The risotto was okay, but for a tomato risotto I expected to be able to discern a nice sharp parm through the rice and tomato. Eh.

And my companion's? Her arabbiata was no different from my Sunday sauce except that possibly there was a smidge more heat. Maybe. Her beans & greens? They tasted like canned beans and boiled greens. Where were the deep, rich, garlicky, long-cooked flavors of good beans & greens? Nowhere to be found. Skip the beans & greens.

The cocktail list? Eh. Nothing tempting whatsoever. At least the bar was packed with young professionals checking each other out over their never empty glasses. Looks like a happening place for after work!

Bottom line? The space is nice. The cocktail list is boring. The food needs some serious improvement. BUT, I have hopes the execution of the menu will rise to meet the presentation and the surroundings. I'm looking forward to checking it out again in a month or so and being able to raise my rating. And please, execute the hell out of that cocktail list before my next visit? Thanks."}
{"text":"We have visited this place twice since arriving in Pittsburgh. The first time, we ate on the second floor. We had the kale salad, pasta Genovese and a spicy sausage panini. It was all delicious and the perfect amount of food for two. Today, we ate meatballs on the first floor. Oh. My. Gosh! The marinara sauce is incredible. The aroma of that sauce is what permeates all the floors of this great place. Top it all off with great service and a cool drinking spot on the top floor, and this place will keep people coming back."}
{"text":"Great menu, Great food, great service. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"3-3.5* for food, but rounded up for the concept, atmosphere, & price point

Decided on this spot for a late night dinner as it was near my hotel and the reviews looked half decent.  Gosh, anything seemed better than the actual eateries in the Westin!

Sienna Mercato is divided into 2 sections:  The main level is a meatball joint and the line-up outside, for most evenings, is for the rooftop restaurant which features a more traditional, upscale Italian fare.  

Although I wouldn't order the Veg Meatballs again, they were well seasoned, but the texture was mushy (from the white beans), I liked the Mac 'n Cheese that came with them, Marinara was ok, and I loved the concept!

Not only were prices decent, but you could mix and match the kind of meatballs - or even meatless - in various different plates, sauces, & even add sides if you want.

They also had a cheap dessert menu which consisted of a few items for $5.  I would NEVER see a $5 dessert in Toronto, so that was a treat.

Would definitely go back to try the other meatballs, sauces, sides, & of course, the numerous beers that they offer!"}
{"text":"cool place, three floors, three different places. We went to the roof top for the beer and got some bar apps.  The hummus was deciduous and so was the ribs.  Great place to chill."}
{"text":"After never receiving a call back from any level of leadership, I was blocked front their Facebook page from adding comments or reviews. 

Very classy, guys. I am excited to see this place fail. They're disgusting."}
{"text":"Calzones are huge even a small!! Great place to grab a slice or are just in the mood for some food! Close to the hotel we were staying."}
{"text":"Love Sienna Mercato. With 3 different restaurants you get 3 great experiences. Typically I spend my time at the 1st floor meatball restaurant or the patio bar. Either way you get good food and a great beer selection. The ambiance is great and the food I'd above average on the first 2 levels. The appetizer menu on the rooftop is adequate though nothing special. That said the experience more than makes up for the food selection."}
{"text":"Lunch before a home steeler game is the best time to come downtown and try these new restaurants because it's not busy. I have heard things about this place and was interested to try it. They have three floors. The bottom is known for meatballs, the middle is Italian with wood fired pizza and the top is the bar. 

Today we had the meatballs. I got the arugula salad with meatballs with sauce on the side. The meatballs were ok. I felt like they needed a little more seasoning/flavor in the meatball. I got the beef, chicken x2, and veggie. 

Beef- a little fatty, no visible seasoning 

Veggie- more carby than veggie. I could see the beans inside. It was good still but I think they should name it like a \"black bean or Lima bean ball\" not necessarily. \"Veggie\" 

Chicken- was the only one with visible seasoning or flavoring inside but it was good

The sauce I got was the almond pesto. I think the almond muted the pesto flavor because I didn't taste it that much. I think they needed some garlic in there.

I would come back here just to try the other offerings you can make but today was eh. The service was great and our server was very helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"Always amazing vibe and meatballs. Stopped for lunch and got the beef meatball sliders with the creamy Parmesan...delicious"}
{"text":"Diverse and good music, good beer, and excellent Tacos.  What more do you need?   Laid back atmosphere and a nice long bar.  Check out the Taco  mascot!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Emporium on the 1st floor. They specialize in meatballs. They have Classic Beef, Spicy Pork, Chicken, and Vegetarian. They have 9 different types of sauces. They range from Marinara to Creamy Parmesan to Chicken Gravy. You can order sliders, panini, meatball sandwiches, and even Saucy Balls. The slider is 1 meatball, the panini is 2, the sandwich is 3, and saucy balls is 4. With the saucy balls you can order a couple of different sauces. They also have different sides like mac n cheese, tarot tots, and several others. You can also order a side of pasta. They have 4 types to choose from. I think it's fun to go with people who also like to try new things and just order random items. I have tried several different things. My favorite is the Chicken Meatball with Creamy Parmesan. They go well with the Tater Tots. My second favorite is the Classic Beef meatball with Pork Bolognese sauce with a side of pasta. 
They start your meal buy bringing you a tall glass bottle of room temp flat water. They open it and pour you a glass. They have a full bar. The have a nice selection of craft beers. I usually get iced tea. They serve desserts but I usually don't have room left to try one. Maybe next time we'll order dessert 1st."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner per suggestion of the concierge at our hotel.. Definitely worth the 5 minute walk! We ate on the second floor, pasta/pizza level. The decor is awesome, exposed brick and beams, super hip. We tried the lamb gnocchi appetizer which was out of this world! For dinner I had the mushroom risotto; flavor panel was great, however, risotto was very undercooked and crunchy which in my opinion is not what a risotto is supposed to be. Our server was great and very helpful. Overall I would definitely suggest it to a friend as a cool night out in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I've been here quite a few times and each time I find another reason to go back. The food is excellent across the board. Panini, the sub, or just the meatballs; It's all a tasty en devour for your mouth.   

The pizza on the second floor is fantastic and the drinks on the third are worth spending the time and money. If it wasn't enough, they have a great beer selection on the first floor as well and the service was polite and timely.  I highly recommend Sienna Mercato for what it's worth."}
{"text":"Great rooftop bar - esp the Moscow mules!! Ate at Mezzo - really yummy although definitely overpriced.  Our server Mike was great.  Would recommend"}
{"text":"I have been to Sienna Mercato many times now, for happy hour, events, and meals. I have been impressed every time. Attentive service and a wonderful atmosphere on every floor. I wish I had a favorite but I like all 3 floors, it's hard to choose. A fun way to try different foods on different floors, I really like the concept. The rooftop beer garden is one of my favorite places for happy hour in the city. A modern environment with a good crowd of people. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. 

There are 3 floors, each of them are basically their own restaurant with their own menus and ambiance. So it's like 3 restaurants in one. 

I wanted a meal before I got on the bus home so I went to the 2nd floor (Mezzo). As soon as I walked in the manager (I think) was very friendly. When he saw my Yankees shirt, instead of cursing me out like most other people would do, he started a nice conversation with me about NYC. It turns out his wife is from not too far from where I'm from. 

I had a salad and the Frutti di Mare, which I felt was a little small for a \"medium\" plate, but it had a lot of flavor. For dessert the Pear Mascarpone Cheesecake was sooooooo gooooood."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The rooftop bar is a great way to spend an evening with friends.  The bartenders were very attentive and chatty.  The roof was closed due to snow, but cool anyway.  Drinks are a little pricey, but worth it for the atmosphere.  We ate at the meatball joint downstairs, I had beef balls with mushroom gravy and mashed, so delicious.  We always get the poutine with fries, I am obsessed.  The others had government Cheese and pasta, the raved about it."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Emporio Meatball Joint, the first floor restaurant of Sienna Mercato, several times before writing this review and the consistency of the high quality food and outstanding service is beyond impressive. After many meals with lots of different people in groups ranging between four and 14, the food always rocks and the service is always flawless.

The menu is has some great starters. My favorites include the crab balls, Buffalo chicken balls and the rocket salad. The entrees are all meatballs, which seems improbable, but with the three step fun process  -- pick your ball, pick your sauce and pick your preparation (and perhaps a side), the possibilities are endless and it never gets old. I'm a fan of keeping it simple with the saucy balls. Servers can often suggest some winning combinations with particular sauces and sides. There's an extensive craft beer selection that's heavy on local brews, some good cocktails and an adequate selection of wines.

Service is always on-point. I have to give the restaurant props for the ease with which they handle large tables. On at least two occasions I've had over a dozen people at a single table. Not only does the staff nail it by getting orders correct and having courses arrive at once, but upon request they cheerfully provide separate checks (yes, even for 12 persons!) and they make it look easy. I can think of a lot of restaurants that could learn a thing or two from the customer service that Emporio provides.

The atmosphere is fun and lively with a good soundtrack. Big windows at the front open to the sidewalk when the weather is nice. There are high-top tables in the bar available too.

There's no reservations,but it's a sizeable place and tables are always turning over. Plus, they use the No Wait smartphone app very effectively and the bar area is an inviting place to wait, as is Il Tetto, the third floor rooftop bar worthy of its own praise (as is Mezzo, the second floor restaurant).

For those unfamiliar with downtown Pittsburgh, it's worth nothing that the restaurant is very close to the convention center, Westin Hotel and Courtyard by Marriott and is only a few blocks from the theaters of the cultural district and the bridges that lead to PNC Park and the Warhol Museum."}
{"text":"I didn't mean to spend all of my money at Sienna Mercato. I only meant to get three meatballs with some spicy sauce, or maybe creamy, or maybe pesto, over a bed of spaghetti, or maybe penne, or maybe in a bun. And I only meant to get a glass of wine, or maybe a bottle, or maybe two. I only meant to try a sloe-gin fizz, or maybe a Moscow mule, or maybe see their take on a dark and stormy. I definitely only meant to get one appetizer, maybe the french fries; no, two appetizers...I only meant to get two appetizers, because the french fries had to be paired with the cheesy bread, or maybe even the mushroom arancini. And, I guess, while we're at it, I might as well try the warm ricotta doughnuts for dessert. Luckily, I had a few people with me who also only meant to get one or five dishes.

The worst part? I've been here before. Maybe next time, I'll show some restraint (but I doubt it).

P.S. Order everything."}
{"text":"A few co-workers and I went here shortly before the holidays for a Christmas lunch. What's really interesting about this place is its like three places in one; they have the meatball joint, a charcuterie & pizza place and a beer garden on the roof. I love meatballs. Like, really, really love them, so that was clearly where I was going to focus my calories. 
It was pretty crowded and kickin' when we got there and this was just a couple days before Christmas, so I can only imagine how it is when downtown Pittsburgh is at full capacity. 

Most of the menu (on the meatball side) is a \"pick your own\" type. You pick the kind of meatball you want, the kind of sauce, the serving option and a side. One really nice feature is they have quite a few vegetarian/gluten free options. 
Two of the ladies got the panni, which is a two ball sandwich. The third got a salad w/a meatball and I...dropped the ball again (no pun intended). I ordered the mac'n'cheese with a single turkey meatball. Now, it was good, very good actually, but I am just not a pasta person, and why on earth I ordered it is beyond me. 
The pasta was good and creamy, and the meatball was very good; nicely seasoned and tender. I just wish I would have gotten a panni or even a couple sliders (they are the 1 ball sandwich) and tried different ball & sauce combos. The one woman did get the parm-herb fries though and shared; they were super yummy. 

I fully intend to try this place again and I feel like it will totally upgrade to a four or five star review. 
      *note* if the word \"balls\" makes you giggle, be prepared when you read the menu."}
{"text":"I'm a generous person so I'll give Emporio five stars. Actually the only issue we had with the entire evening was using the nowait app and expecting a 15 minute wait, when in reality it was closer to 30 minutes. I guess I can't blame them, it was a Saturday night, so I am assuming it's one of their busiest nights. While we were waiting we saw numerous people coming in thinking they could get to the restaurant by the elevator, other people using the stairs and not being able to get to the rooftop deck, and just a general cluster of people that didn't seem to know where they were going. I think this would best be sold having a member of the waitstaff at the doors directing people and helping them so that they knew where they were headed. I had looked over the menu previously so I already knew what I wanted to order, my husband ended up going with meatball grinder just a basic meatball sub that you could get anywhere, but he really enjoyed it. I was super excited to try the chicken meatballs with the crack sauce over the crispy brussel sprouts. They were just as good as I had expected. The meatballs were a little bit tough but the flavor was excellent, the crack sauce had that little bit of kick, and the brussel sprouts were perfection. I ended up bringing one of my for meatballs and quite a few of the brussel sprouts home. Next time I go I may just end up getting 3 meatballs instead of 4. I would love to try some different variations of meatballs and also some different sauces so we will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"Sienna Mercato is unique in that it is comprised of three floors - Emporio, Mezzo, and Il Tetto. I have not yet made it to Mezzo (too pricey for my blood), but I have gone to Emporio and Il Tetto on numerous occasions. Emporio is notorious for their absolutely mouth-watering meatball dishes. My go-to's at Emporio are the poutine and \"Saucy Balls\" with chicken meatballs, crack sauce, and mac & cheese. If you're still reading, you deserve to know the best kept secret about Sienna Mercato: their RICOTTA DOUGHNUTS. Accompanied by a bowl of dipping chocolate and paired with a nice cup of coffee, they're the perfect ending to an Italian night out. The service is always quick and the food will leave you wanting more."}
{"text":"Went with a group and we each got a different style of meatballs. All of the meatballs were good, but the general consensus was that the vegetarian meatballs were the best! They were unique and delicious. I never thought that it would be possible to eat a vegetarian meal at a place known for their meatballs!"}
{"text":"Updating my review after going back again. The food was good but the meatballs seemed a bit \"off\" and on the chewy side. Maybe the chef was having a bad day..
Will give this place another try later."}
{"text":"A three tiered restaurant with a lot going on. First tier is a meatball only restaurant. With the amount of combinations you can make - I believe there are over 30 types of meatballs anyone can have. It sounds like a strange experience but it is anything but. Second tier is a more Artisan restaurant. Pizza and appetizers are great and the wine selection is quite elegant. Lastly, my favorite part, the third tier, open roof patio, beer garden. I recommend taking some friends here any night of the week for a beer, sit under the clear sky, and enjoy."}
{"text":"I really really enjoyed my experience here. First off, the decor is great, I love the exposed brick and wood. I also love the cups they have for your water and I know that is an odd thing to say, but they are awesome. 

We ordered the buffalo balls for an appetizer and the presentation was spot on and the flavor was equally great. I ordered the Spicy Pork Meatballs, Spinach Almond Pesto Grinder with cheddar cheese and it was DELICIOUS! My date ordered the Regular Meatballs with spicy marinara Grinder. He graciously shared a bite with me and it was equally as delicious. 

The service was a little slow and that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5. I am sure after time, or at least I hope, that their service will get better with time since this place is brand new."}
{"text":"I HATE HATE this place with a passion. Their stupid rule about the rooftop is the most frustrating thing I've ever experienced. Oh and the food sucks!!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the Classic Beef Meatballs! Added pasta and marinara and had a perfect spaghetti and meatballs dinner. Only problem is I wanted more meatballs. Looking forward to trying more dishes and from what I had I'm expecting all to be excellent."}
{"text":"Meatballs on the first floor. Very casual, great for after work sharing. Lots of balls lots of sauces. Very reasonable prices"}
{"text":"We hit the ground floor of SM on a Tuesday night before a concert for a meatball adventure!  

Knew we'd be fighting the after work crowd, but YIKES!  Even though we were seated immediately in a fabulous booth, the waits for everything were l-o-n-g.

Loved the vibe and our meals were good.  

Started with fried pickle chips - one of our favs.  Very good!

Three of us had Spicy Pork Balls and although good, no one thought they were spicy - Friend had the traditional Beef Balls and said that they were very good.  They also went with the Risotto and gave it two thumbs up!  Parm/herb fries were tasty and Hubs enjoyed the mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy with his balls.

And everything is served in cute bowls of varying sizes.

Would've liked to try dessert, but too slow to chance it.  Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here since sometime last summer and I was excited when a co-worker suggested that a group of us should do lunch at \"that meatball place\" today. When we got there we started to discuss \"plan B\" after we requested seating for six. The hostess said that the biggest booth that she had available could only seat five. After a bit of discussion we decided that we'll make it work somehow. The hostess took us to a round booth in the corner and it easily fit all six of us. The seating area where we were seemed to be on the darkish side but the booth was comfortable and we sat there for about five minutes before a waitress came over and asked if we'd like to get started with drinks.  I asked if we could see menus and the waitress seemed a little annoyed... not annoyed at us, but more on the order that the hostess who seated us should have already brought us menus. Perhaps this has happened before but she was kind enough to get them for us.

I think it's kind of interesting how the menu is laid out when it comes to ordering meatballs. You first pick what type of meatball you want, classic beef, spicy pork, vegetarian or turkey; then you choose a sauce; finally you decide how you want your meatballs served be it on sliders, a panini, a grinder or in a bowl. We all ordered something different; I ordered the spicy pork with Bolognese in a bowl. It didn't take very long for our individual meals to come out.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal and my spicy pork meatballs were yummy. They were a little smaller than a tennis ball and generously covered in rich Bolognese sauce.

Other than the hostess being a bit \"off her game\" today, I give Emporio a thumbs up.  I don't think that it's one of those places that you order the same thing each time you go. There's so many combinations of meatball choices to choose from."}
{"text":"The food and ambiance made the biggest impression on me.  This place has a clear vision of what it is and embodies that really well.  Casual/industrial chic with a limited menu of only meatballs.  No kitchen-sink syndrome here.  The lighting was really low, though; trying to squash the dreams of those Instagramming diners.  The downfall for me was the service - definitely didn't leave me with a great impression.

So, the food.  I love meatballs.  I can make my own bomb diggity beef meatball at home, so I went with a turkey meatball slider topped with spinach almond pesto. (I heard from a friend she got a few sliders to try different things and couldn't make it through her second.) I also got a side of escarole and beans.  About halfway through I was thinking \"dang, I could go for another one.\"  The meat was tender and juicy for turkey, though it didn't taste like you just bit off a turkey leg.  The pesto was a perfect compliment to the light meat.  And the slider bun...so fluffy, a little sweet, and perfect.  A harder bun would have squished the meatball - the light bun held the integrity of the ball.

My boyfriend got the Meatball of the Day - a sausage ball with BBQ sauce and coleslaw as a grinder.  Harder bun, heartier meatballs, perfect sauce and meat combo again.

Now, the service. We were here on the early side, around 5, so we had an attentive server in the beginning.  As more people came in, she practically disappeared.  When it came time to ask if we wanted dessert, I said that I could, but I would need to see the menu again.  She came back quickly....with our check.  Okay.  She's busy, it's cool, we'll just have another beer.

So I went to the bar to grab us another round.  The bartender reprimanded me.  \"If you're sitting at a table, you have to order from your server.\"  I explained she was no where in sight and we wanted to grab something before happy hour ended.  He dismissed me saying the manager would take care of it.  I left the bar and waited a good 5 minutes for our server to bring us our beers.

When she did, we asked about a price on the check.  The draft menu had our beers at $6, but they rang up $6.50.  She told us the menus were reprinted that day and took our check away, I assume to adjust it.  She didn't.  Now, 50 cents isn't a big deal, we just wanted to let them know there was a discrepancy so they could fix it.

After another 15 uncomfortable minutes, we had to ask for our check back - it was getting busy and I felt so awkward holding a table when we could have easily moved to the bar to finish our drinks.  We did and saw that the chalkboards had the price of our beers at $6 as well.

Great food, great place, off night for service."}
{"text":"Amazing place to go! Had the pork meatballs with mac and cheese and my mom had the special October meatball that has bratwurst with risotto which was to die for. Also have the ricotta balls with fudge!!! Soo goood! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This review is for Emporio, the first floor restaurant within the larger establishment. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could - lots of vegetarian options (I had Tomato Risotto and Beans & Greens, both delish), very decently priced, big but not sterile atmosphere, etc. Only thing lacking is the option to order carafes of cheap house wine - this place has the perfect casual vibe to call out for cheap wine, but everything is priced by the glass at $8 and above. Management, change that one thing, and Emporio would be totally perfect!! Regardless, I'd recommend this great downtown option."}
{"text":"Please skip a the lengthy reviews that give 4 to 5 star ratings on this place.  Nearly everyone of them have a complaint about the place.  Atmosphere is very cool however the food is not nor is the service.  

My wife and I went to this restaurant on a suggestion from the concierge at our hotel.  We asked for a table near a sporting event we wanted to watch and the hostess told us \"to find a place and let them know\".  We found a great spot, I put my jacket in the booth and my wife sat down while I returned to tell the hostess where we were seated.  As I return my wife is leaving the table and informed me the other hostess did not say a word to her just shook her head no as to say you cannot sit here.   

For some reason we decided to stay and I really wished would not have.  After reviewing a basics offering of items we decided on the saucy balls and asked for two options of meatballs which we were swiftly told you cannot mix your balls?!?!  Instead we opted for the bolognese sauce with spaghetti which came out in stainless steel bowls that resembled something you would use to feed your dog.  The beef balls were great the bolognese and the pork balls not so much.  We also ordered salads which we never saw, I took two bites of my entree and pushed it aside (I normally eat everything).   The server did not offer another option nor did he offer to take it off my bill.  Two beers 6 oz of pasta with two meet balls for $40 does not seem appropriate.  I travel all over the country for work and have experienced my fare share of poor and great food.  However in all my experiences I have not been compelled to wright a review until I found this place.  PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO ELSEWHERE!!!"}
{"text":"Such a cool restaurant concept! I truly recommend that you take the time to visit this place! You can choose to visit 3 different levels here: 1st level is dedicated to meatballs (comfort food made gourmet), 2nd level is dedicated to charcuterie and cheese and pizza and the 3rd level is this romantic and roof top bar. It's a great spot to snack, feast and/or drink, what else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburgh for a friend's baby shower and ended up going here for dinner in the evening after the shower. From the photos and reviews of their other restaurants, I expected that the pizza would be delicious, and it looked like it would've been from the photos. The crust was a bit too soft for me and the sauce tasted like it was right out of the can and slopped onto the pizza without any seasoning at all. I don't know what it was about the pizza but it just tasted pretty half ass to me. I can find better thin crust style pizza in the Midwest. Go somewhere else for pizza and don't waste your time or money here!"}
{"text":"A friend and I headed here on a Saturday evening. It was a bit of a wait to get seated for the restaurant, so we headed upstairs of the rooftop deck. Got a few drinks at the rooftop deck and ended up staying for about 3 1/2 hours - it is a really great experience up there. We headed upstairs at about 1030 at night and decided to eat.  At first I was a little disappointed in the lack of choices on the menu, until I realize that what they had, they did well. I tried for the five meatballs that they had that night along with the side and all were very good. We decided to head back on Monday evening as well and realize that they had two dollar meatball sliders. This night I again tried several of the meatballs and several of the sauces the chicken meatball is very good!  The ambience of the place is pretty neat- a good time!"}
{"text":"Il Tetto... my absolute favorite place to have a drink and a light bite to eat in Pittsburgh.  The view and atmosphere just transforms you to a big city.  If you have not been here yet, you are missing out.  Just stop in for a quick minute.  You don't even have to have a drink or any food... but I'm thinking once you're up there on the 3rd floor, you'll want to stay a few minutes and savor the beauty."}
{"text":"All around goodness! Awesome and attentive staff that gives great insight into both the menu and the brew on hand. Really enjoyed all the different choices and loved the atmosphere. 1st floor is meatball heaven. Second floor is pizza pie heaven. Third floor is brew and snack heaven. Go...now."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Maybe because I'm Italian and from New York And I'm spoiled. But the Sunday sauce was far from delicious. The Mac and cheese was overly seasoned with Parmesan. This place needs to hire a real Italian."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh loves their customizable menus! Here you can decide which meatballs you want depending on meat and sauce, later creating pasta, sliders, or other dishes.

Came here for my birthday and they were super accommodating for a big group."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent food! Everyone must get the chef's selection of breads and cheeses! This might be some of the best pizza I have ever had in my life. If we ever come back to Pittsburgh, this will be on my list of places to go!"}
{"text":"Emporio: A Meatball Joint - never ceases to amaze me with their B.O.M. (Ball of the Month). Most people like to switch it up with the Pork, Turkey, Chicken, and other Meatballs, but Grandma's Beef should be all that is on your mind if you're a first-timer. The amount of juice and flavor that these meatballs soak up is incredible. I recommend the Saucy Balls Entree, where you'll get 4 equally sized tennis balls of meat glory. If I go Grandma's Beef, it's with the creamy parmesan sauce. Almost just as important as the balls is the appetizer. The poutine is a snack for all that you will come back for time and time again. I get the poutine with tots, mushroom gravy, PANCETTA, and a fried egg!"}
{"text":"Everyone was raving about the retractable rooftop bar so we had to check this place out. The roof was closed because of rain but still the views rock. 

Can't comment on the specific menus served on the first and second floors but seems those dishes are well covered in other reviews. We had two things in mind. Beer and appetizers. So up the elevator to floor 3 (the rooftop) we went. 

I was glad to see open tables on a Friday night. We were seated and served promptly.  Ordered bruschetta and beef tartare and a couple of cold draft beers. No complaints can be filed. The appetizers were great. Bruschetta was loaded with tomatoes. Perfect. 

Will certainly go back the next time I'm in the Burgh, n-at!"}
{"text":"This is a really great concept with ace execution. I would give the food a 5 out of 5, but the service is probably at a 3 for me. However the super reasonable prices and unique dishes made up for it. During my visit we visited Emporio's and I went for the meatball of the month. Not disappointed. It was a spicey sausage meatball with banana pepper inside and served in a vodka sauce. Pretty happy with my experience here."}
{"text":"I like the Emporio, lower level. The meatballs are great when combined with the many sauces. I relatively cheap date and in nice weather you can sit up by the sidewalk outside. I have been here many times. Always fun. Not fine dining...not even close, but fun."}
{"text":"The veggie meatballs were delicious !! The tomato risotto is also highly recommended. The donuts were absolutely delicious.

I was surprised by so many tasty veggie options :)"}
{"text":"After anticipating the opening of Sienna Mercato's more refined, middle floor for months, Mezzo's food, atmosphere, and service greatly surpassed expectations. 

To start, we ordered a bottle of wine and the greens and beans. The appetizer was average, but next time I think I'll go for the grilled octopus or split a charcuterie board. The overall vibe of the place encourages sharing, so for our main dishes we split a risotto dish and the tartufo pizza. I'm always a fan of risotto and it didn't disappoint. The pizza was topped with mushrooms, truffles, a medley of cheeses and an egg; probably the most unique pizza on the menu, but still nothing too exotic. My only complaint for the pizza, is that I would have preferred the egg to be over easy as opposed to scrambled. 

While I was definitely satisfied, but not extremely overwhelmed with my food, it's really the atmosphere and set-up of the entire Sienna Mercato is really what makes it stand out in downtown Pittsburgh. Mezzo's interior boasts beautiful exposed brick, charming wall art, and high ceilings with floor to ceiling windows to match.  The combined three levels of Sienna Mercato fill a void in downtown Pittsburgh and turn Sienna Mercato into a destination, not just a restaurant. Prior to our dinner, we were able to grab drinks on the third floor while we waited and having a rooftop beer garden adds major value to the place, even when the roof is covered. 

Classy enough for date nights, but casual enough for dinner with friends."}
{"text":"We had dinner here Friday night and the place was packed. The appetizer of bbq meatballs was very good - loved the crust on the outside and great flavor. Their beer selection was good and service was even better. I'd love to return and try a few other dinner choices."}
{"text":"I was alone and ate at the bar.  Good service and casual atmosphere. Ordered the famous meatballs and a  salad. All very reasonably priced and delicious."}
{"text":"Not to take away from a local legend such as Premanti Brothers, but when we had one night in Pittsburgh on a film shoot, the option came up to go out to eat and one of the non-local regulars suggested Sienna Mercato.  

Everything on the menu look good but I proceeded to go with the Dragon Balls... I'm sure an homage to Game of Thrones. 
What a wonderful and fun place after dinner we proceeded to the rooftop for drinks and the other business establishment and had a blast."}
{"text":"I came here for an event that was on the third floor. I've never been to the third floor and I just assumed they would be just as great as the first floor. I was a little bit disappointed but I don't know if maybe the event was just poorly planned and I don't really want to blame the third floor.

The food was amazing, the staff was really good too, and the drinks were not awful. I started out ordering a peach Frozen drink but the waitress came over with the rose and asked if it would be okay if she gave me that instead since the peach was out. I kind of felt weird say no since she already had the drink poured and in her hand, but I'm sure that I could have refused it and it wouldn't have been that big of deal. And quite frankly that drink was delicious. I will definitely go for that one the next time that I'm there. So even though there was a little bit of a mix-up I'm glad that it worked out.

Since we were there for an event and larger party was going to be coming I decide to order every appetizer on the menu because I was the only one there during the happy hour specials. So my reviews of those appetizers would be that number one those cajun fries are delicious. It is really hard to mess up fries but it can be done, and I was really happy to see that they were very crispy and not too overly seasoned. Nothing makes me sadder than salty fries that are inedible.
 
Number two however they made that curried carrot hummus with the arugula pesto dang get me another order. I was pleasantly surprised and how good this was. Don't get me wrong it was really weird but still it was really really good. I even suggested it to the table next to us when they were thinking about getting snacks. It was slightly sweet yet an interesting taste.

The baked brie was okay. Nothing to really write home about. I think it could have been cooked a little longer because it wasn't really gooey gooey it was just kind of warm.

The pretzel logs were awesome too. The cheese was a little off and in the middle of the pretzels they were kind of a little bit doughy. I would get them again but if I had a choice between the pretzels and that arugula dip it would be a toss-up.

I did not like the crab dip. It had very little flavor to it and it tasted too much like fake crab. And I'm not opposed to a fake crab dip but it just has to be seasoned a little bit more than this was.

So at the end of the night when we tried to pay we got our bill and we wrote down what each of our names were associated with how much we were paying. When the waitress came back she said that we still owed about $13. That was really confusing considering that we added everything up. It turned out that they added some vodka drinks to our bill after we were done paying. Thank goodness we kept that original sheet with no vodka on it because they wanted proof that that we did not drink the vodka. It was a little bit odd and kind of off-putting but we got through it after we produce the receipt. The waitress that came around just said that the manager wanted to make sure the receipt didn't have it on before we could leave. I don't know if that was the truth or not but I did feel bad for her, just because she was helping out the waitress who was actually waiting on us was caught up with a large table who came in.

And while I know that this is not the third floor is fault it gets super loud in there when they close the Rooftop. It was starting to sprinkle a little and so they close the roof but that made it so sticky underneath that glass. Had I known that it was going to rain I probably would have picked a different floor. But again not really their fault that it rained. I just wish that they would have pumped a little bit more AC once they close that ceiling.

Because of that little weirdness at the end with the receipt I have to go with three stars. Possibly the next time I can bump it up to another one but we'll see."}
{"text":"Okay meatballs.  My average lunch ticket here ($18) on several visits far exceed my usually allocation for daily work lunch ($10 average).  Foodwise, I have had:

Meatball panini with dipping sauce - probably the better item versus the other below choices. Reason being is that the sandwich must be pressed in a panini press, forcing out a hot sandwich.  Still hungry after having this.  3.5 stars.

Meatballs over pasta (Saucy Balls with pasta option).  Meatballs taste okay with the spicy meatballs having the most flavor.  Meatballs in all visits are never hot and lukewarm at best.  2.5 stars

Tater tots:  good.  Crunchy and crispy.  If I crave tator tots, I will come here.

Probably will not return due to cold meatballs and high lunch prices for non-filling/satisfying content."}
{"text":"An old and very good friend of mine was dying to hit Sienna Mercato prior to a show, and despite my middling prior experience with them, I caved. 

I've found that if you don't get too risky in terms of your choices, you might have an above average meal here. For instance, I stuck with a Classic Beef Meatball Panino and found that it paid dividends when it came to succulence and decadently plush texture, the halves of bread tasting like the most divine buttered toast in the region. My chosen cheese was smoked gouda, which possessed an alchemist fantasy flavor blend of charred, creamy, and nutty. The Pork Bolognese sauce I requested could have been served in a cheddar-crusted crock topped with diced onion and called chili. I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference, and I would have been very happy with it,  the rich, meaty, bowl of stewed vine fruit providing for me a bit of a warm, comforting relief on a bitter winter's evening. 

The House Cut French Fries were adeptly prepared, meaning they were twice-fried crisp and not limply blanched, even if I felt the kitchen went a little gonzo with the herbs and parmesan. But aye, they were merely a vessel for the fantastically aromatic and addictive malt vinegar aioli. 

Remember what I said about taking chances? My friend Dan did, going with their \"Ball of the Day\" along with 3 other selections. Despite my reluctance, he insisted that I sample a chunk of his Cordon Bleu meatball, and Eureka, it actually tasted like a successful, ground-up take on the real thing! Wet, dense, and savory, the sphere or reconstituted poultry even had the milky, tangy sauce that makes the dish. Well done, chef. 

Sienna Mercato is still a bit trendy for my tastes, and their tradition-defying experimentation doesn't always sparkle, but when they stick to the fundamentals, they exceed expectations. 

P.S. The service was fine overall. 

P.P.S. On our weeknight visit, the joint was dead, but hey, we didn't mind at all. At least Bambi and The Ratchets weren't there. Hey, we're both committed, y'know? Geez."}
{"text":"This place only offers meatballs and they are terrible. The meatballs are flavorless, mealy and have more bread crumbs in them than meat. This place wants to be hipster but they're missing the good food. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Sienna Mercato is a nice building/market with 2 restaurants (Emporio - a meatball joint and Mezzo) and a Il Tetto (a roof top garden)."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! Loved the chicken ball with pesto and rocket salad! Mac and cheese needed a little salt, but was tasty otherwise!"}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant both times I was in pittsburgh. The food is absolutely amazing. Each meatball is great but my favorite is the classic. Service is always fantastic and I've never had to wait for a table. If you go here, don't forget to check out the rooftop bar"}
{"text":"We did the Emporio Meatball joint.  Menu confusing as heck, too much of a schpiel required by the waitress.  Wanted to get just a plain meatball with Marinara, unable to order that, she said, unless I ordered the meatball slider at a dollar extra beyond the addition of a meatball to the soup.  Poutine would have been great, but the cheese curds just completely slid off the frites.  Frites were really delicious though.  Spaghetti that we ordered with the Marinara sauce and meatballs was just okay, but meatballs clearly the star here.  Dining partner said this tin serving dish his meatballs and spaghetti arrived in was awkward to eat from, would have preferred a regular porcelain bowl.  Chicken pieces in the wedding soup were almost brittle and old-tasting, could have left that out and just added the meatball, which I ended up doing.  Good place if you're heavily into meatballs."}
{"text":"Oh Sienna, how I love you. More obsessed than anything, but that's besides the point. 

So there three different stories to this place.  Emporio (place to get great meatballs), Mezzo (Italian food), and Il Tetto (rooftop bar area).

Let me start off with Emporio. Now I like to think that I make a damn good meatball, but these people have knocked me out of the park. My usual go to is Saucy Balls. I usually go for the classic beef and spicy pork in the equally amazing marinara sauce (though I like to change it up every once in a while and go for the pork bolognese or government cheese). And of course I have to get the Poutine every time I come (with fries of course).

At Mezzo I tend to stick with their Beef Tartare (which is absolutely amazing), Risotto (always cooked perfectly) or their Veal Polpettes. We typically split a Chocolate Crema Torte if we aren't stuffed by that point. They also have a Pinot that I am absolutely in love with and have to get every time I visit.
 
Last but not least, is Il Tetto. The rooftop beer garden that is open year round (has some really great views for future reference). This is the place I go when I need a really good cocktail in my life. Or of course, a good beer ( there is a reason they call themselves a beer garden). The bar snacks are pretty good too. A big go to for me no matter where i go is pork rinds, and I must say these are pretty good. The Loaded Fried Potato is pretty good as well (anything with bbq and cheese has my heart). 

Service is always excellent and everyone is always so polite and helpful. If you are downtown, I seriously suggest giving this place a try, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"The great: First of all, the service was impeccable. Our server literally rattled off about five specials without looking at notes, then went on to explain several other items on the menu we were interested in

The good: The food was good, not great, but tasty. We will more than likely come back. 

The bad...and the reason for the three stars instead of four...the restaurant has a great upstairs, the reason we came here, but when we arrived at 6:00 on a Monday night we were originally shown to a small--very small--table at the end of a long booth, which was adjacent to the service area. When we asked for a table along the window, we were informed that they were reserved--all of them. When we asked for a table on the second row, we were informed that they were all reserved as well. 

Practically our entire meal, those tables remained empty. In fact, we saw four more sets of guests leave because the tables weren't available. 

We understand the need to reserve for large parties--not four-tops--but we do not understand reserving ALL your prime tables, which means that tables will sit empty for an hour instead of giving those tables to the patrons who are there and waiting."}
{"text":"After a day's worth of driving, Sienna Mercato proved the perfect landing spot to unwind, eat, and drink. 

We arrived at the restaurant at about 9pm and the place was packed. We opted to put our names on the list to be seated on the second floor, which offered a more family style dining experience compared to the first floor (a \"meatball joint\") or the third floor (a rooftop beer garden). With a 30-minute wait ahead of us, we learned that sitting and ordering at the bar was an option and decided to forgo the wait for an immediate seat.

For dinner, we chose to share a couple of plates. Brought out at the same time, we ordered a large charcuterie plate and a small plate of Pennsylvania made cheeses. The charcuterie was simply wonderful. The large plate offered pork taurine, Genoa salami, pate, duck speck, and dried pork loin among others. The meats, all of which are house-cured, were paired with pickled vegetables, smashed San Marzano tomatoes, and crostini. The cheese plate was well curated to match and paired with candied almonds and a raisin chutney. The selection of cheeses varied in intensity, beginning with a mild smoked Gouda and concluding with an intense, yet balanced, bleu cheese.  Our meal concluded with the tiramisu. While very good, the cream was a bit heavy for my taste (but this was probably because I had just consumed several pounds of meat and cheese).

When you combine this attention to detail with an excellent staff and efficient operation, there's no question why Sienna Mercato is a huge success."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night, we had the pickle chips and even our seven year old who HATES pickles ate several. The meatballs were moist and flavorful. The mac and cheese is a little meh, I had the government cheese version as my daughter already got creamy parmesan noodles. Overall a solid restaurant with great service, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sienna Mercato has really great specials for happy hour! They also serve a poutine that is on par with some places in Toronto. I'm also impressed by their selection of draft beers -- I was excited to find that they sometimes feature the watermelon beer from 21st Amendment. 

The meatballs, however, are a bit dry and poorly seasoned. They are also soaked in sauces that taste excessively sour and sweet. In fact, it is often hard to discern one type of meatball from another. I've tried their meatballs in a salad, on a sandwich, or by themselves and I can't say that I look forward to eating them.

Although it's a great place to grab a drink in downtown, I wouldn't recommend having a meal here."}
{"text":"All i can say is - Saucy Balls.  Beef Saucy Balls with Pesto.  Oh My goodness.  Everything was fantastic!  We got 2 different types of Saucy balls with 2 different types of sauce and 2 sides.  Obviously - my fav was the Beef and Pesto, however the spicy pork with pork bolognese is quite scrumptious as well!

Our sides were greens and beans and tomato risotto - both of which were superb!  I can't say enough about how scrumptious the food was.

The only bummer - for me was - the 3rd floor bar has a local cider joint on tap - Arsenal Cider.  I was quite bummed to find that they didn't have Arsenal on the first floor.  While I enjoy Strongbow - supporting local businesses is always the ideal in my world :)  With oodles of local craft beers, you'd think that you'd support the ONE local cider location :)

Other than the simple cider snafu, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Lots of options for both meat eaters and vegetarians. The vegetarian meat balls were very delicious with pesto. The selection of beer and simple cocktails were just what I was looking for. If you want to go for late night drinks, their rooftop bar is UNREAL!!"}
{"text":"I love this rooftop bar! It's so open and cute. Our server was not the friendliest but it's okay, they were slammed. I really enjoyed the drinks although the food menu should be expanded a bit. I like the idea of small bites but I need more of a variety. Nothing sounded appetizing which drinking a bunch. The ambiance is so good so id come back!"}
{"text":"Great meatballs;) can't really comment on the other food. I only go for the meatballs and salad- yummy:)
Servers and bar tending staff are awesome!
Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Sienna Mercado has 3 floors with 3 different menus. This review is for Emporio (1st floor only). 

We went ice skating at PPG Plaza (separate review) and then meatballing (neologism?) for dinner. The vibe is lively but chill. Friendly service. Wood and concrete decor gives a very rustic look. 

The ordering process is (unnecessarily) complicated. Ask your server to help you customize your order before it gets too expensive. We went with the saucy balls where you just get balls in sauce--no sliders, grinders, or paninis.

Collectively, we tried combinations of:
Meats
-turkey: gluten-free (!) but bland and disappointing
-beef: loved by all
-pepperoni (the special): loved by all

Sauces
-marinara: great on all the balls and the fries and the penne and my fingers
-pesto: good, but not great (arrived a bit cold too)

Sides
-herb fries: awesome!
-g/f penne: more please!
-tomato risotto: must have!

Husband was wowed by the extensive craft beer selection. 

Tip: It's more fun with a group so that you can eat many different combinations of balls family-style!

Tip: Use NoWait to get in line before you arrive--they don't take reservations.

P.S. I've also been to Mezzo (additional menu options), and it was also delicious, (and they do it up gluten-free!) but it was too long ago for me to review! I'll just have to go again soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, the most recent being this weekend for the meatballs. We were seated very quickly, had room to stash our stroller at the entrance (out of the way) so that we didn't awkwardly have it at our table and had great seats near the big open window. There were lots of other little kids there (right after the kids marathon) so I was happy that we weren't the only ones bringing a little kid to such a trendy place. 

I wish our server had helped us navigate the menu more as we weren't sure what would fill us up. Next time we'll ask more questions. We also wished we could mix our balls and sauces. We did, however, enjoy saying balls for the entire meal. 

I had one turkey slider with the pork bolognese and the arancini rice ball appetizers. My husband had the 4 saucy turkey balls with the pesto and plain fries (omg the fries were amazing!) and our friend tried two different sliders. Overall, we enjoyed our meal but I can't say they were the most amazing meatballs I've ever had. We will definitely be back though because the menu was extensive and I still need to try out the 2nd floor. We attended an engagement celebration on the roof in the fall and enjoyed our appetizers and drinks, and of course the view!"}
{"text":"Tried the second floor with my boyfriend and his parents on Sunday. Wow!!! It was amazing!! To start we had the meat and cheese board. I do not care for meat but they said it was so good and cleared almost the whole board. The presentation to the little information the girl presented when she came out was perfect. Our server was also beyond amazing, I wish I remembered his name, :( !! Well he was great and he had a new girl training with him she was doing a nice job as well. They cleared our silverware between each course and were tip top on refilling my iced tea. For dinner we shared some pizza, the Margherita and hot sausage/potato. The Margherita was probably the best I have ever had. I'm not sure which floor is better the meatballs or the pizza..? So try and find out for yourself!!! :)"}
{"text":"Upstairs beer garden. Service was slow, couldn't even fill water glass. Large convention in town, need better management on staffing."}
{"text":"I love the decor in this restuarant ! I had the Rocket salad it was really good!  And I had a classic beef meatball on a bun with sunday gravy which is just a marinara sauce it was good!  I definetly want to go back and try some other dishes and appitizers that look really good, The front of the resturant opens up to the outside which is really nice!"}
{"text":"Ordered two meatball sliders. The chicken meatball with spinach pesto was lacking flavor. The ball of the month was a stuffed banana pepper meatball with a tomato creme sauce, which was really flavorful. The meatballs are decently sized.

My friend got the vegetarian meatball grinder sub and unimpressed. The meatballs had too soft of a consistency. The service was quick but even for a Tuesday night Emporio was very loud. Overall nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"Great vibes & food.
Regular place for happy hour. 
Food varies by floor so try it all!"}
{"text":"Sienna Mercato is one of my favorites downtown. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is fun, and it can satisfy if you just want to grab dinner and drinks or if you want to head up to the rooftop for late night festivities. My go to is the vegetarian meatball panini with arrabbiata sauce - but the sides are all delicious too - nothing disappoints!"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent patron and Sienna Mercato never disappoints. Start on the ground floor where meatballs are their specialty and can be ordered in a plethora of ways. Then head up to the rooftop bar for a drink and a panoramic view of the city. If that isn't enough, they have a full service restaurant on the second floor."}
{"text":"\"Hey, Jules, let's go somewhere different for lunch!  Why don't you pick?\"
\"Did you say different?  I've got just the place!\"

Can you imagine the brains behind this new concept restaurant?  Let's serve meatballs.  Different sides.  Different sauces.  Let's make the joint trendy.  And this works.  The interior has lots of reclaimed wood, interesting light fixtures with vintage light bulbs, lots of modern metal chairs, comfortable booths and garage doors up front so when Spring finally does arrive, they can open this place up.  It's also a pretty good spot to watch a game.

Also, not sure why this is listed as Sienna Mercato.  Only Emporio is open so far.  So, I think it's going to be confusing when the other floors open with different names.  I would think each floor deserves it's own Yelp page.

Anyway, first off, our server was amazing.  We must have looked blank and stupid staring at the menu trying to make sense of it.  Of course, after she explained it, the menu makes sense.  Service was very friendly and attentive.  BJ was very happy because of all the beer choices on draft.  And we appreciate that.  BJ was first up.  He got the wedge salad and two of the sliders.  His picks were Classic Beef (grandma's secret) with arribiatta sauce.  And a Vegetarian (mushroom, white bean, cauliflower) with spinach-almond pesto sauce.  The arribiatta was thick and full of flavor.  Amazing.  And the pesto sauce was even better.  The balls are huge.  Two and 1/2 ounces.  Doesn't sound like much, but that's a lot.  The salad had tomato, chopped egg, pancetta, a nicely craved carrot, and crouton.  The blue cheese dressing was SO good!  

I was being overly cautious with my order.  I simply got the Vegetable Minestrone soup and a ball.  The soup was very hearty, and consisted of tomato-fennel broth, carrot, onion, green beans, and kidney beans.  So good!  I got my meatball plain, I picked the Spicy Pork with chili pepper and herbs.  Perfect.  But I could not leave well enough alone, I had to copy the big guy and get a slider, too.  Funny how fast they can bring those balls out.  My second go round was yet another Spicy Pork, this one with the pork bolognese.  The slider buns are soft and delicious, the sauce was yum yum.  Needless to say, I was totally stuffed full, over my limit.  And had to miss out on dessert.  That's okay, because we are sure to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Well, I will hand them this...they've got balls.  BIG balls...well, ok, not all THAT big. If you listened to the foodie social pages, they'd say they had the biggest balls of all.

But the balls I paid $16 to put in my mouth were NOT all that big.

Last year at this time, I wanted to treat my co-worker to dinner for her birthday, and we ended up at Mahoney's, where the server left part of poor Rachel laying on the floor until we left. This year, I left the choice up to my co-worker, and she wanted the balls. So off we went to Sienna Mercato after work.

Atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere...

Ok, so enough of the silliness. We both ordered the saucy balls, not to be confused with the Schwetty Balls, which consisted of four balls of choice over a bed of your choice. My co-worker had been here previously, and had tried the beefy balls, and found them to be tough, and she had tried the pork balls and liked them. So we both ordered the spicy pork balls, served on a bed of mac n cheese, hers with creamy Parmesan, and mine with 'Government' cheese. I don't recall what 'sauce' she ordered to top her balls, but I chose the mushroom gravy.

Gleefully, they are Coke people, so we both ordered Diet Cokes. The sodas arrived, and we both sipped at about the same time, and both of us developed the same look on our faces. This was regular coke, not diet. The server was very pleasant, and made the switch. Ahhhhhh, that was better. 

Oh look...six TV's with sports coverage...now there's something different.

The female service staff all looked very clean cut. The male service staff...well...kinda looked liked they'd just crawled out of bed, and dressed from the hamper. Just sayin'...

After about fifteen minutes of small talk and soda sipping...our bowls of balls were placed before us.

Now, just to give you a hint about how big the balls are...in almost all of the photos that have been posted, you will see what looks like a wooden skewer impaled into a meatball on the plate. Items in mirror may appear larger than they do in real life. This is not a skewer, but is actually a wooden sandwich pick with a bead on it. Now that you have an actual scale to think of, that ball doesn't look so big now, does it? And...they're not.

Are they tasty? Yes. Are they phenomenally spectabulous, take your breath away, freakin' magnificent like the balls your Italian Nana cooked up with her famous gravy? Um...they're about the same...except Nana had bigger balls, and really WANTED you to mangia all of them. We had four. On top of a spoonful of mac n cheese seasoned with (as far as my tongue would guess) Old Bay seasoning.

The mushroom gravy was brown...and at one point when the server came by I asked her if the mushroom gravy was supposed to have mushrooms in it. She said yes, and that it did. But she 'believed' they were pureed. Hmmmmm. Good cover for no chunks.

Now, according to the latest price index, ground pork currently stands around $2.50 per pound. That's NOT allowing for a bulk discount usually afforded to a restaurant purchaser. These four balls certainly were not a full pound, and I'm pretty darned sure that in usual meatball style, they were cut with some bread crumbs, bound with an egg, and with a pinch of seasoning added. Your average box of mac n cheese, which will serve four according to the box, starts around fifty cents. Gravy - milk, flour, some pork fat, already made with the baking of the balls, a few pinches of seasoning. Per person, maybe a buck max. 

So, two portions of this, eight balls, two scoops of mac n cheese, with two Diet Sodas, no sides or bread or anything, and the total bill came to $36.38 before tip.

So...once again, in da burgh...I bought a big ol' heaping plate of atmosphere, drastically upcharged by a greed mongering dahntahn landlord, whom, like most other Pittsburgh land owners, believes that their property values are on the same par as a real city like NYC, Chicago, or San Fran, and that forcing a business to overcharge so that they came make bills and RENT, is a-ok.

They tasted good. They tasted like meatballs made of pork. No better or worse than anywhere else. Mac n cheese is mac n cheese. Were eight meatballs, two serving spoons of mac n cheese and two soft drinks worth over $40 in the end?

Nana? Is your gravy ready yet? I'm hungry...and broke."}
{"text":"I loved the overall ambience and intimacy of this place, inside it has a rustic industrial feel  to it. Today the front part was open which was nice to soak in downtown.

I opted for Italian wedding soup with a wedge salad but no meatball I figured there would be some in my soup but it was a chicken only base.

My wedge salad was very fulfilling with the heat bacon and out of this world randy dressing. Definitely try the ranch.

Today I dined on the first floor but the rooftop beer garden is stunning especially at night time the city view is breathtaking."}
{"text":"The meatballs here, were amazing!  The poutine was also very good!  Service was awesome.  My server recommended a really good meal for me."}
{"text":"We went here for a quick drink before a prior obligation on a Friday night around 6pm. The atmosphere was fun and I was really tempted to get so of their delicious meatballs but was able to restrain myself. Instead I ordered a the grasshopper cocktail with cr√®me du menth and it was a delicious pepperminty drink. It tastes like a smooth candy cane with peppermint dusting on top. I have been here for the food before and the meat balls are amazing."}
{"text":"Meatball heaven, even for people like me (vegetarians)!

Cool ambiance and trendy atmosphere. Takeout menu is different from meatball selection, and there is a wide variety of drafts available."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant on Penn Ave that's reasonably priced. At first I thought this would be an upscale restaurant based on the name but I think they did that on purpose. It's a comfortable restaurant that's only been open for about two months. The meatballs were delicious and the menus were very original. I had the pork meatballs in a panini with Gouda and spinach almond pesto. The sauce was amazing. For a side I had the rocket salad with balsamic vinaigrette. Great atmosphere with the bar and stainless steel dining. Definitely going back again to try the other sauces. Our waiter told us they're going to have 3 floors with a rooftop area too. Great addition to the restaurant scene of downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The reservation thing was weird and confusing, and the wait was pretty long. However, it was a Friday night at prime dinner time, so I can't complain too much. We got the crab balls, cheesy bread, and truffle parm French fries for apps and they were so freaking good. The fries were probably the best I've ever had in my entire life. For the main course I got the beef meatballs with Gouda and pesto sauce, grinder style- which was three balls on a roll. Holy moly. That was amazing. The pesto was so salty and delicious from the Parmesan it, the Gouda was perfectly sliced, and the balls were fall apart tender and soooooo tasty. DEFINITELY try this place"}
{"text":"Yummy! The best part, their super helpful menu star system called out every item that contained tree nuts. Thank you! Gavin could eat his meal with the reassurance that it was safe. He loved the homemade donuts, that came to the table warm and still crispy on the outside."}
{"text":"So awesome for a happy hour scene, but not for happy hour prices...

The third floor rooftop is amazing! However, the winter atmosphere was compromising. The heaters installed were uncomfortable to sit near if you were at the bar. The heat on your face is so intense, you have to face the tables so you don't get artificial sunburn. 

The French75 cocktail is delectable. I didn't have a chance to try any of the bar food, but the selection was ok. It would be nice to offer more food options for the outdoor seating as well.

All in all, it was nice. Nice mix of people, and I can't wait to go the the beer garden when it gets warmer."}
{"text":"I love this place. Adorable ambiance. Great menu with a cool niche. I love the veggie meatballs. My husband loves the pork, beef and the chicken ones (when those are available on special). It's a great place to have drinks. The only negative about this place is that they don't take reservations so that can be a bit of a pain. Other than that I love it."}
{"text":"I've eaten on the second floor everytime I've been there and spent some time on the rooftop deck.  The thing I love about this place is the ease in which sharing your dishes can make the excellent food very affordable.  We almost always get a charcuterie tray and a few flatbreads to share and have never been disappointed.  One thing that is disappointing is that you can't order drinks from the rooftop bar, so the selection is lacking.  
I still need to get around to trying the emporio section of the restaurant and will update my review when that occurs."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Sienna. Everything was top notch; the food, the service, the atmosphere.  The restaurant is very chic. I loved the3rd fl rooftop bar, which is just beautiful! the place was packed on a sat evening! most of the tables were taken and even the balcony was packed.  The food was phenomenal.  The staff did an absolutely wonderful job of making sure we were well taken care of the entire evening. I always say the hallmark of a good restaurant is that I never run out of water. I drink a ton of water with dinner and my glass was never dry."}
{"text":"I'm so conflicted by this review. I expected so much from the reviews...maybe because I live in New York and I've eaten my fair share of meatballs. I was not amazed or satisfied with these meatballs. I tried their beef, chicken, pork and veg meatballs. It's hard to even pick a favorite from the four. The meatballs were flavorless, mushy, and just not right. The appetizers and sides were good however. I loved the quinoa. The cheesy bread and salad were solid choices. But the star of the show should've been the meatballs and hence the 1-star. Probably would not give this another chance. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Took friends to the emporio section of the restaurant from out of town because this is supposed to be a popular place. Every person in the party got food poisoning!!! Each person got a different entree so it wasn't just one meal. 

I've been to the emporio chain of the restaurant in Wexford a couple times before and there were no problems, but I will not be going to the downtown one again."}
{"text":"This establishment is a great option for craft beers and meatballs. The ambience is interesting and service is always great. They offer several types of meatballs served over a variety of options. I've had most of them and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh over the weekend and ended up picking Sienna Mercato for lunch. I wasn't aware that the place was known for its meatballs. I am vegetarian and wasn't sure how the veg meatballs would taste. I went with the server recommendation and she got me 2 meatballs with the tomato risotto. I loved it! For the price the quantity and quality was great! My date and I both were really happy being fed here. Also, the decor is so cute they do have a rooftop beer garden that's open on certain days. I will def be coming back here for more when I'm around next!"}
{"text":"I've dined at the sienna emporia for a girls' night out.  I'm not so sure that it was a good environment for catching up with friends (crowded and noisy) but the concept and menu certainly were unique!  I loved that they offered a vegetarian meatball (which was delicious by the way) and the variety of sauce options was awesome because I'm not a big fan of marinara or traditional red sauces.  Will be returning!"}
{"text":"This is not only a cool concept of a restaurant but really good quality food and drinks. The I got meatballs on top of tots with \"crack sauce\" let me just say, so good I literally dreamt about them that night! 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Met my sister who was in town for a convention at the Westin for a late Sunday night dinner.
I ordered the turkey meatball slider with marinara sauce and prosecco .  She ordered the turkey meatball panini with smoked Gouda.  I also ordered the Parmesan herb fries  and this order was enough to share. We both enjoyed our meals.  The staff was helpful and attentive. The menu was unique.  Loved this place and I will return."}
{"text":"Just okay. The food was okay. Service was a little slow. Water was warm and we didn't get refills. Glad we came to check it out, but we definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I was dragged back here by a friend, and it's not as bad as I originally thought.  The place is always busy, but never too busy not to find a seat.  The waitstaff appears and disappears, one server morphing into another.  You never seem to know who's waiting on you, and they never come when you need something.  They're not very good at answering questions either.

You would think that a restaurant revolving around the meatball would have killer meatballs.  But they don't.  The meatballs are dense and flavorless.  

Last time I was perturbed by the lack of bread.  This time I learned that if you order sliders you get lots of bread.  I ordered three with different sauces - the crack sauce, a chicken gravy sauce and a cheese sauce.  The only one that compensated for the bland meatball was the chicken gravy.  But the bread (bun) was really good.  It'd be nice if it were preceded by a salad..."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday night after checking in to the Westin down the street. Low and behold it was $2 Meatball Sliders Monday. Place was bustling with energy and plenty of lively end of day conversations. I ordered the Italian Wedding Soup, a classic marina beef meatball slider and a pork with bolognese slider. Food came out freakishly fast with each slider in individual metal bowls. The wedding Soup was simply prepared with Escarole, Pastina, Parmesan and a few pieces of chicken. I wasn't expecting too much and I wasn't disappointed. The classic marina slider underwhelmed, but the pork bolognese made up for its slider compatriot. After blowing through the sliders with a combined spend of only $9 and a bit of room left in the stomach, I ordered an additional Almond Pesto Chicken Slider to round things out. The Pesto was great and probably prepared fresh and in house; easily my favorite of the three sliders. Overall, I felt like this could be a cool place to grab a craft beer and enjoy conversation with colleagues, but on this night I came alone with low expectations and left with full stomach. The bonus was that I only spend $11 on food and won't even need to submit a receipt for the expense report..."}
{"text":"Gets too busy most of the time....the Exp was just ok....the eggplant panini was really nice....however the mushroom risotto was below average....bdw they don't serve complementary bread being an Italian join ...\"Mezzo\" I meant....the service was ok....overal exp was lower gha. My expectations....don't get too overwhelmed by the look of the rest!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a meatball? How about lots of different types of meatballs? There is always a very unique ball of the month. Pepperoni fritters are a great appetizer. Lots of beer choices."}
{"text":"Sienna Mercato is a 3 story Italian restaurant and bar. On the first floor they specialize in meatballs but you can get appetizers, soups, and sides to go with it. The second floor which wasn't open during my visit is an upscale Italian restaurant. The top floor is an outdoor bar.

Since I was downtown and had little time to catch a show I opted for eating on the first floor. The waiter was very nice and went over the 5 different types of meatballs they offer. Meatballs are normally $3.50 each but if you are really hungry you can save more if you buy 4 and of course you can make a sandwich out of it.

The meatballs come with your choice of sauce. I decided to go with the chicken meatballs and a side of broccoli with parmesan cheese on top. Believe me those meatballs very delicious and the broccoli spears big and very tasty. Two meatballs as sufficient for me and my waiter very extremely attentive to my needs and my having to be out of there to catch my show.

I really enjoyed eating on the first floor and hope to return in the future to try out their second floor restaurant next time I'm in the city. It is located in the 900 block of Penn Ave downtown and there are other restaurants in the vicinity to try.

Definitely worth the visit! Food was out of this world good!"}
{"text":"Landing in Pittsburgh for the first time in my life, I took a friend's recommendation and headed over here with my (dining, and all other things) partner in crime. Great suggestion, we had a delightful, relaxed lunch in the Emporio downstairs area.

This is Italian pub dining at it's best, mostly salads, superb french fries and meatballs, presented in a variety of ways. The Caesar salad had great croutons, fantastic dressing, and we cleaned it up totally (It's too bad that really crisp, fresh romaine lettuce is unobtainium in this part of the country in the fall and winter.)

We had the Poutine (French-fried potatoes baked with cheese) with a meatball, which was very filling as a main course. The panini (two pork meatballs) with tzatziki sauce was also great, a perfect serving size. The sauce is really a great counterpoint for the spicy pork, and the crispy bread was the perfect texture for the assembly. Their tzatziki is authentic, with thinly-sliced cucumbers, and was easy to dip and apply to the panini with a knife, bite-by-bite. We both felt quite full with the salad and two dishes.

Our waiter was fun, easy-going, informative, relaxed, and made good recommendations. A Chilean sauvignon blanc paired great with everything. 

And the decor is really well designed. Re-purposed boards form a rustic ceiling that damps the sound just enough so that the place feels lively, yet you can have a conversation without shouting. Lighting is excellent. The industrial touches complement the old brick, and the signage is painted in a way that looks just worn enough to feel relaxing

The price is on the high side of $$, with a bottle of wine, salad and two dishes, we spent $60. Still, I'd come back any time I can, and wonder how good dinner is up under the glassed-in third floor, either open air in the summer, or under the skies in winter."}
{"text":"visited pittsburgh this past weekend and went to sienna since we heard there was a beer garden? lol 

arrived at 730 and put our name down on the first floor ... aaand the wait was an hr n a half long T_T so we just proceeded to the 3rd fl rooftop bar and got some beers to start~ wow the rooftop is just beautiful! the place was packed on a sat evening! most of the tables were taken and even the balcony was packed. Thankfully, we were able to get a table for our group of 5~ i was starving and wanted to get some appetizer to start.. but apparently the menus are different on every floor? the beer list was quite extenisve~ but appetizers were not too appealing.. so we decided to wait it out.

FINALLY after some time, our table downstairs was ready at last! thank god for that refreshing watermelon beer to keep my mind off of the hunger. lol the menu on the 1st fl was all about them balls of meat!  it is exactly like the meatball shop in NYC!! which i absolutely adore! so we knew exactly how this was going to go down.. pick a type of ball, a sauce and a side.  i got the \"saucey balls\" which is a set of 4 and i picked the traditional beef meat balls with pesto on top.  i was also ecstatic to see a menu for poutine! my o my~ i got my tater tots fix alright!  added some bacon to it and had a side of chicken gravy for dipping.  i wasn't big on the chicken gravy.. BUT surprisingly, the tots tasted fantastic with the pesto sauce from my bowl of meatballs!! so huh~ how bout that? tater tots with pesto..? 

i definitely struggled to finish all the things in front of me.. everything was delicious! including their special sausage meatballs~ and boy! was this hearty meal fulfilling and satisfying! watch out meatball shop in nyc! sienna mercato is right up in your alley! lol i would not b surprised if sienna mercato makes its way to the east coast~ the variations offered at sienna is a huge game changer!  PLUS tots?? i'm sold .. sry MBS~ you're gonna have to step up your game to win me back :P"}
{"text":"Food and service from waiters/waitresses is fine - the management leaves a lot to be desired. Our server and the server's assistant working were great but the manager was overall rude and uncommunicative both with us and with our server when questions arose about the menu and the establishment. I have to say we will not be returning to Sienna. There are a lot of great establishments downtown, and I do not feel comfortable supporting this one after having seen how badly they treat their lower level employees."}
{"text":"We walked in here on a whim after the Pittsburgh Home and Garden show and boy I'm glad we did.
After being greeted, the hostess explained their concept. Each floor is something different! We weren't in the mood for meatballs or just tapas so to the 2nd floor we went, Mezzo. 
There was four us and all shared the Artisan and italian cheese plates, as well as their bread basket to start. All of this came out along with someone to explain all the different types of cheese and bread we had in front of us.. Which was a lot! We were impressed the server knew exactly what each one was and how well he did presenting it. We enjoyed trying all the cheeses and testing our memory. 
Next came dinner, we ordered a Quattro Fromaggi and Marghertia pizzas. They were a great follow up to our delicious start. These aren't your typical pizza joint pizzas, they were full of flavor and the perfect crust. After that, we were full as can be! 
The service, their presentation and knowledge of the menu was on point. The ambiance is one of a kind in Pittsburgh with its three themes. I cannot wait to go try the next two floors!"}
{"text":"I've had a few bad experiences here in terms of service and reservations, but tonight was great. Made my reservation with the NoWait app and had no issues. Food was great, drinks were great, waiter was the best (Can't remember name - possibly Joseph??). Totally redeemed itself. Will likely be back, via the NoWait app."}
{"text":"I've honestly had one of the best servers I've ever had here. She was super friendly, in a chill and non-freaky way. She could pick out exactly the beers that I liked based on a quick discussion, and steered me towards some really excellent finds.

Food is amazing, drink is amazing, and I love the atmosphere. This is one of my favorite downtown restaurants."}
{"text":"Had an early mid week dinner at Mezzo. We had a very delicious pizza with some pickled tomatoes that was awesome and some octopus gnocchi that was good too. Wine list was on the smaller side but what we got was good. Server was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Just tried this place and the Italian cuisine was very good. The chefs choice cheese board was fresh and the server explained each meat and cheese. After that we shared the flavor-able farm chicken.  Finally the dessert. Of course it was scrumptious. Pictured are Rose and Becca, our server."}
{"text":"Great meatballs and very creative method of creating dishes! I tried the traditional meatballs over the daily vegetable choice with the spicy marinara  and it was great! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was definitely good and reasonably priced. I got the Pork meatballs with the pork Bolognese sauce, but tried all my friends and was not disappointed. THE POUTINE (tater tots) was borderline life changing. 

BUUUTTTTTTT do not go there for your birthday. My friends and I obviously spent plenty of money, but the only thing they could do was a slider bun with a candle in it. Just do nothing? At least tell me you do nothing so I can order a dessert for the birthday gal!"}
{"text":"Having been to the other two levels (Mezzo and Il Tetto), it was finally time to try out Emporio on the first floor to round out my Sienna Mercato experiences. I stopped in for happy hour on a Tuesday and we had no trouble getting a table near the bar right away. They run some happy hour specials including half-priced drafts and $5 wines.

My friends and I ordered some appetizers for the table to go along with our drinks. The pepperoni fritters were delicious little balls of gooey cheese with a crispy outer layer and marinara sauce for dipping. I didn't really get the pepperoni (I'm assuming it was in with the cheese maybe?) but they were tasty. The buffalo friend chicken balls were also very good (basically a buffalo chicken meatball), with just the right amount of spice and a really great blue cheese celery slaw. The last item we ordered was poutine. We opted for tots and the mushroom gravy. The tots were crispy and really good along with the melted cheese curds and savory gravy. I washed this all down with a Bell's Two-Hearted.

I'll have to go back for a full dinner sometime, but it's definitely a great happy hour option for some drinks and bites to share!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best summer pLaces in Pittsburgh!

The pros: The food on the first floor is simply delicious, it's much much more than a \"meatball place\" (but oh, those meatballs!). Drinks are good too, nothing special, but definitely standard. The rooftop deck is fantastic (but don't expect to get a seat Thursday through Saturday).

The cons: the food upstairs isn't quite as great as the downstairs and you can't get the meatballs (sigh). The drinks are craft, but I'm a sweet drink person and there isn't much for me.

I recommend: eat downstairs (get the broccoli, the pesto sauce and the mashed potatoes), then spend the rest of your night on the third floor."}
{"text":"The girls at the hostess stand were very nice.  They helped us look at the menu and made recommendations and convinced my friend and I to eat here.  Well, I should say they convinced us to try to eat here, because no eating was done.

We were seated at a table squeezed between two other tables.  That was fine though, because one table was finishing up and the other was eating.  One waitress went to the table to our left four times while we sat there...once to clear plates, then to drop the check, then again to pick up the check and finally to bring the receipt.  The table to our right had another waitress serving them and she checked on them, as well as three other tables to the right.  She even had to bring one table five \"to go\" bags!

The table to our left was cleared once the people took their receipt and left.  Unfortunately, the lady sitting there forgot her coat, but the waitress talked to a bus boy and asked him to see if he could catch her.  He couldn't so they put the coat behind the bar.

Why am I telling you all of this?  Because that's all I can tell you.  We sat there while numerous employees were inches from us, interacting with every other customer in the place but not a single server made eye contact with us, offered us water, said \"be right with you\" or acknowledged that we existed.

I went up to tell the hostess who sat us that nobody was serving our table and she shrugged and apologized but seemed helpless to understand that if nobody is going to serve a table, you probably shouldn't seat people there.

So we went down the block to Ten Penny where actual people recognized that we were hungry people who wanted food and drink and were willing to pay for it and had a great meal.

I get that on a Sunday evening when you're busier than expected, service might suffer.  But just tell me that up front and I'll go somewhere else rather than sit in a restaurant for 15 minutes being ignored and dissatisfied and end up writing a one star review for your unacceptable level of service on Yelp."}
{"text":"Cool place for a beer and a game! The meatballs were berry tasty but the sauce was a little too salty. Service was friendly and efficient. Good concept check it out for a small bite!"}
{"text":"Two of my favorite things about this place: the location -- right in the heart of downtown PIT, and the meatballs. So many choices, so many flavors, quite simply, a meatball lovers dream come true."}
{"text":"The pizza is so good! This restaurant is exactly what I want out of The Cultural District. I love the atmosphere and the design is so inviting."}
{"text":"The owners of Sienna Mercato definitely had a cool idea for a hotspot in the Cultural District. Every floor is a different restaurant, so it's basically a bunch of interesting and hip places all packed into one location! I have dined at Emporio (ground floor) twice and have snagged a drink at Il Tetto (rooftop bar) a handful of times. I'm looking forward to trying the pizza at Mezzo (middle floor) soon!

Emporio's main focus is meatballs. It sounds strange, but these are not your average meatballs. They really are pretty good; I like to get mine in panini form with gouda cheese on top. I wouldn't say I'm absolutely rushing back to Emporio any time soon for the food, but I think it's a very cool atmosphere and a trendy place to take out of town guests. On the other hand, I really love the rooftop bar at Il Tetto. It honestly could not be in a better location. In the summer they open up the glass roof and you see the Steel building and Highmark building looming right above you. You're really right in the action here, and it's no wonder that it's always packed. Il Tetto is such a neat place to experience the city of Pittsburgh with a drink in hand."}
{"text":"Veggie meatballs were excellent...and we had better poutine there than in Montreal!  The atmosphere is casual and the service nice.  Get non-alcoholic beer!!"}
{"text":"Came to Mezzo last night for a friends birthday dinner. I've been here a few times before and have always enjoyed it, but I think things have gone downhill there. Service was a bit slow, but they were pretty busy. We had the fruitti di mare pasta which was delicious and I wish we had ordered more of that. However, everything else we ordered was a miss. The pizza we ordered, which came with sausage and peppers, was really skimpy on the toppings and the sauce was overpoweringly sweet. We also had the pork chop which was overcooked and bland. Lastly we also tried a risotto that had a very strange odor - my friend could barely eat more than two bites. Luckily, they offered her something else and took it off the bill, which I appreciated. Overall I probably won't be back to visit unless it's to try the meatball restaurant or the rooftop bar."}
{"text":"Sienna Mercato is no joke! I've been there a handful of times and haven't disappointed yet. They have their standard meatball offerings, as well as a monthly meatball special. I've gotten several combinations of meatballs and sauces and they've all been terrifc. Although the special stuffed pepper meatball was delicious, I would have to say my favorite combination is the classic beef and tomato sauce. It is done well, and it stands on its own. Also, they have a friend pepperoni ball appetizer that is so, so, so good! I could eat two orders myself (and there's a decent amount of time). The beer list doesn't wow, but they do have delicious cocktails, and the bartender made us ad hoc sangria, even though it wasn't on the menu. I would go every week if I could!"}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for happy hour on a week day, so I can only comment on my experience at the bar. Even on a week day, there was a 30+ minute wait for a table, however, we were perfectly fine scoring two seats at the bar. We ordered drinks and were able to order some \"saucy balls\" as an appetizer. 
The vibe at the bar has a very luxurious feel, and the drink menu is extensive. Lots of after-work, happy hour people. I also only was able to stay at the bar on the bottom level, I did not venture to the upstairs. 
For the happy hour crowd, I would say the bar was a little understaffed. I am not sure if there was an event going on that time, or if they are usually this busy on a week night, but they could have used at least one more person behind the bar.
I thought the food was delicious and quick to come out.
I also ordered the cheese and olive plate, which was perfect with my cab sauv.
Highly recommend for after-work dinner or drinks!"}
{"text":"This review is for the first level: EMPORIO, the meatball joint.

A tradition we have when we go on the road to watch our hockey team is to have a pasta dinner on our first night.  I found Sienna Mercato on yelp, and said the place was about 0.4 miles from our hotel, and the hotel had a shuttle that could take up to 11 of us. This restaurant is divided into three floors, the first floor is a meatball restaurant, second floor is a charcuterie and pizzeria, and a top floor is a beer garden. The third floor is on the roof, but the room is enclosed in glass.

Reservations can only be made for the second floor restaurant, and since there were 20 of us, it took a while for a table as it was first come first serve. The staff was very nice and tried to accommodate us with two tables of 10. While we waited for the table, we went to the rooftop to get some drinks, but we had to wait for a table to free up as well. 

Fortunately, It took about 45-minutes to get my text message our tables were ready. We were seated adjacent to each other, but with different servers.   The downstairs level wasn't very large, so we were quite fortunate to have our group in just 2 tables.

The menu had a variety of things, but I wanted to try all their meatballs, so Stephen and I shared a combination of them:

Pork with pork Bolognese, and the BOM (ball of the month ) with marinara, Vegetable ball with govt cheese, the Turkey meatball with mushroom gravy, and my favorite of all, the classic beef meatball with the spinach-almond pesto.

What I didn't realize until we paid was our meatballs were the same price as sliders.  Basically, we were not given our bread. I don't know if it was a miscommunication or an error on the server's part, but we left on a rather sour note.  

Overall, everyone enjoyed their meal.  The service was decent, despite the size of our group.  Most of the group had the 4 meatballs with pasta, which was too much for one person.  Perhaps Stephen and I should have split that, or, gone in with others to share a variety of meatballs and pasta. Oh well, there's next time!"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes yes!!! This combo joint is a downtown highlight.
Best part? Hands down the rooftop deck. 
It gets so crowded especially during nicer weather when every downtown worker wants a happy hour cocktail or beer.
Happy hour has pretty impressive deals and definitely worth fighting the crowds."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday night with some friends. Used the NoWait App to keep our place in line and headed upstairs to the rooftop bar to check out the scene. It was not as crowded as I expected and we were able to find a place to hang out for a bit while waiting. 

We were seated quickly once we returned downstairs, but we were seated in the front window which was open and it was raining and chilly, I would have preferred that they closed it. 

Our waiter was very helpful in navigating the menu and gave ample time to look at it. 

Appetizers that were ordered included the hot sausage balls and the poutine with chicken gravy and the tater tots. We did ask the waitress that ran our food to find out if the cheese curds were pasteurized and she never got back to us which was slightly annoying as I was not able to take part in enjoying the appetizer.

I ordered a single slider with the pork meatball and the mushroom gravy which was very delicious and a side ordered of the macaroni and cheese in government cheese sauce that was delicious! 

The prices were also very reasonable and my friend that is doing low carb was able to find multiple things on the menu to eat. 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I feel like this is my go-to restaurant when I'm around that side of town. It's great for happy hour, family get togethers and casual date nights. I love that you can put yourself on the wait list too, because it can get super busy on the weekends.

I was so happy to hear that they were gluten free friendly, considering this was a fave spot pre-celiac diagnosis. The only meatball you can get gluten free is chicken. I'm wondering why that is though? Let me be clear, I'm appreciative, but I wonder if it's harder to do the beef meatballs gluten free for some reason? Anyway, also happy to see the fries and tots are gluten free. That's not always the case because they're fried in the same frier as glutenous items usually. I honestly don't think I've had fries since I was diagnosed, and they were delicious! 

I was bummed to see Auroch's gluten free beer isn't on the menu here. I saw they were mentioned on IG as being at Mercato. I asked our server and she was like, no we don't have it, and walked away. I went to the bar to double check and they mentioned it was probably their other location, which I forgot about. So here's a plea to carry Auroch's downtown too!?

Glad this can still be a dependable option while downtown!"}
{"text":"Went to Sienna Mercato for lunch with some friends.  I ordered two meatball sliders and a side of fresh-cut fries.  One slider had a beef meatball with the mushroom gravy.  The other was the pork meatball with the arribiatta sauce.  The meatballs were excellent - both tender and flavorful.  The two sliders plus fries cost $12.  Not a bad price for good quality and quantity of food.  My lunch companions also enjoyed their meals.  We agreed to come back soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I come to Emporio at least once a month.  We follow the same general ritual every time we come, so I'll give that a share.  

Upon arriving, we order drinks at the bar or as soon as we are seated depending on the wait.  My wife has an alcohol allergy, so there are only a few beers that she can tolerate.  Rivertowne's Hala Kahiki is almost always on tap here, so that always makes her happy.  

The past 4-5 times that we've been to Emporio, we start with the pickle chips which are incredibly delicious.  They are thin and lightly battered, so they aren't too overwhelming and don't make you feel like garbage afterwards.  

For the entrees, we usually both get a pannini and split some good ole' government mac and cheese as a side.  I almost always go for the meatball of the month, where she usually keeps it basic with a beef meatball and marinarra sauce.  

If you haven't been to the third floor for the open-air beer garden, make sure you do. It's one of our favorite places in the city."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here after one of my men's physique competitions and boy did we not go wrong! The restaurant is divided into 3 levels with different food menus on each. The lower level has gourmet meatball specialty items, second level is gourmet pizza and pastas and the third floor is called the roof top which has a bar/brewery atmosphere. We ate on the second level and ordered the Bruschetta del Giorno for our appetizer which was devine, Risotto Milanese with
white wine, saffron and fava beans amd the Quattro Fromaggi pizza with mozzarella, house ricotta, fontina, parmesan, pickleld tomato and garlic. Each one of these dishes were just absolutely amazing in presentation and taste. To end the experience we order the  Peanut Butter Meringue Torte with
peanut butter mousse, salted peanut meringue, oatmeal anglaise and pomegranate jelly. What made the night even more special was our waiter Tom, who met our every need and request to include a military discount by comping the Risotto and dessert. This place is a must while in Pittsburgh!! Thank you for such a great experience!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had the traditional beef meatballs, penne pasta with meat sauce. Great service and food. In town visiting and this was recommended. Please go and enjoy."}
{"text":"My friends and I were there a few weeks ago because we were intrigued by the meatballs concept.  The inside of Emporio(the first floor) was modern and fairly rustic at the same time.  Not surprisingly, there were many people dining and drinking on Friday night which was awesome to see.  When we got there, we had to wait 30 minutes just because there was so many people.  We finally got our seats, and looked at the menu.  There were some interesting things on the menu that we were not familiar with.  This is where it got really ugly.  The waitress with the tattoos came over and asked what we wanted.  When we asked questions about the menu, she just kind of gave a one word answer, and did not seem that she liked us or wanted to be there.  I understand that being a server sucks sometimes, but you have to be nice to your customers be somewhat passionate about the restaurant.  It's meatballs; everyone should be passionate about in some capacity.  

As far as the food goes, two of my friends did not like their chicken meatball dish because they said it lacked flavor.   I ended up getting a pork meatball slider with pesto sauce, and tomato risotto.  They were both fantastic and not too filling.  The risotto was creamy without being mushy.  The pork slider was meaty of course, and the pesto sauce, added nutty basil flavor to the meatball.

Overall I thought the food was fantastic, but the server needs to be more passionate and nicer overall.  I will come back regardless to try the other kinds of meatballs."}
{"text":"While I have never actually eaten here, I love going to Il Tetto for drinks in the summer or winter. There is a glass ceiling that is closed when cold and opens up when warm! They have charming street lamps and string lights hanging as well. The crowd is normally lively and there are plenty of tables and space for standing. If you need some fresh air if the ceiling is closed, there is a little balcony you can escape to as well. Their beer and wine selection is great and their cocktails have never disappointed. I will definitely continue stopping in... and maybe one day even try some of their famous meatballs at the Emporio!"}
{"text":"Like all the stuff I've had from Matt Porco's restaurants, I was really pleased with what I had tonight during my first visit to Mezzo. 
Highlights: nice ambiance with high ceilings with that classy/ rustic Italian thing going on (and a big wall o' wine), nice wine-by-the glass selection in either 3- or 6-oz pours, and an appealing menu.  Aside from the wood-fired pizzas, there is a build-your-own cheese and meat charcuterie platter, several delicious-looking pastas, nice salads, and a few more traditional meat-based entrees.  

My dinner date and I started with salads and split a pizza.  I had the escarole salad and he had the kale, and they were both delicious.  Mine had very tasty marinated tomatoes and a rich, creamy (but not too heavy) dressing. We had the wood-fired vegetable pizza, which was more Neapolitan-style.  The sofrito/ tomato sauce was rich and tasty.  Light on the cheese, like a lot of thinner pizzas.  We tried a few different reds and they seemed like great, mostly Italian selections (the barbera was my fave).  We were also totally drooling over all the pasta dishes that were passing us by, so I might try one of those next time (which they also offer in half-portions; a nice touch). 

Overall, I think these owners have a good thing going with Italian food, and Mezzo is by far my favorite level of Sienna Mercato."}
{"text":"Mamma meatballs!!  If you like meatballs, then this is a yummy and fun place to go for dinner. There are different types or meatballs and sauces to choose from. I've only gone once, but I plan to go back and try another type. 
Also, the service and ambiance are great too!
Good for large groups."}
{"text":"My matzo ball soup was delish! The olives I would skip if ever I return here. My dining companions enjoyed both of there meatball dishes and over all it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Great rooftop bar with a retractable roof for the elements. Nice option to have!  Good selection of beers and nice atmosphere. The downstairs is an Italian themed meatball restaurant that was packed, so it must be pretty good. Haven't tried that part yet. The second floor offers something a little different, so you get three restaurants in one. Pretty cool. Only negative I can say is that the beer prices were a little high."}
{"text":"Stopped here before the game, and ate on the ground floor where they have a  great beer selection on tap and a really cool menu consisting of just meat balls. You can get them as sliders, in a bowel, on a panini, grinder ( hero) add one of a dozen sauces and cheese.  The meat ball of the month I think was bacon cheddar, yea sounds weird, but the way it was described it made my mouth water. I got the spicy pork meat balls on a panini and they were delicious!"}
{"text":"Can I please offer a few suggestions. That said, I am far from an expert.  Small snacks ordered..... chicken meatballs and fried pickles. While both were cooked well, the salt content was over the top.  You need to allow your customer to decide how much salt they want/need. That said, service was great and everyone was a great help. Side note...  the wine could have been sold at a cooler temp. If the wine is going to be second rate (and this customer did not expect different) then serve it with a slight chill. Very simple. I hope this serves as a constructive opinion rather than a scathing rant. Hope the chef listens. Thank you. B"}
{"text":"We heard great reviews about this place.  We decided to go for dinner with a group of 5. We expected the wait, however, when we were seated, we were sat at the bar.   If we did not want those seats it would have been at least another 1/2 hour.  So we decided to sit there (this was supposed to be our family Easter dinner).  Once seated we ordered, we were not able to add or omit anything from the dishes we had ordered.   Our girls wanted garlic added to pizza and they wouldn't do it.  Another person in our party couldn't have cheese and they refused to omit it from the risotto.  Finally, my dinner selection was a pork chop that was on special.  They ended up running out of the pork chop and wanted to replace it with a pork belly (with the skin left on).  Needless to say, we ended up going without dinner as we canceled the entire order and left. I would definitely not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love coming here for their happy hour. Half off all of their drafts and $4 poutine. I'm a bar sitter, and every bartender that's ever waited on me had been wonderful and kind. Being a vegetarian, I was worried that my veg options would be limited - afterall meatball joint - but no sir. They have great veg balls with a ton of veg sauces. You have my recommendation."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection, half off happy hour, and a friendly staff. The meatball sliders were a tasty twist in comparison to the standard bar menu. After a terrible experience at ten penny this was a relief. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Jeez do the people that work here act very pompous. Cool place but the employees need an attitude adjustment. Came in with a group who ended up spending nearly $500 on drinks & food at another establishment that evening, but hostess and manager made little effort to accommodate us so we left."}
{"text":"Meatballs and beer!
This was a grand experience. The food and nice full beer selection were only surpassed by the excellent service. We visited this place on a busy Saturday night and it was packed. Loud by fun atmosphere. Classic Beef with arribiatta, Spicy Pork with creamy parmesan, Chicken with spinach-almond pesto all delish however the Beef was a little bland. I got them in slider form but I would have preferred them In the Saucy Balls. The problem is you cannot mix your balls. With this many choices you should have an option that lets you sample more balls at a time. That would be my only criticism. on the other hand the mushroom arancini were so good I would go back just for them. we also had the tomato risotto and escarole & beans were adequately prepared but nothing to brag about. Plenty of fine drafts on tap and when I say excellent service, I mean it.  I can't wait to go back and try the upper levels.
Note to owner: BALL SAMPLER!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner here a few evenings ago mainly because of the outdoor seating. We ended up choosing the middle floor which was pizza and sandwiches menu. The calzone was pretty good and the was a good wine listing. I was disappointed that there were no draft selections but the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Pretty cool joint. Solid meatballs . Turkey ones were somewhat pasty and flavorless. The almond pesto sauce was electric green and didn't have much taste. I'll be back just to eat the mac and cheese. Tots are solid. Not too pricey and they have a great draft list."}
{"text":"Its hit or miss.

We got off on the wrong foot with the wait. My cousin called ahead for a group of ten and on the phone was told an hour and fifteen minutes to an hour and a half. The text she got said 120 min, but after the time she was told on the phone she read that as an hour and 20 min. So after waiting 2 hours we went downstairs to see what was happening and after some hemming and hawing, there was a table after another 10 to 15 minutes. 

(Notes to restaurant - after we complained you told us its hard to accommodate 10 people in your restaurant. From here on, please tell people that when they call. We have a dozen other places we could visit inside 2 blocks. Also, the words \"its only been 2 hours\" should never be said to a guest who has already waited 2 hours.)

Just based on that part of the experience, I won't plan to return. If I were walking by and saw it empty, I would pop in for sure. But that's the only way I'll go back.

Me and my man both had soup. His wedding soup was very good, just shy of great. It sparked a conversation about Granma's wedding soup, it was that good. My pasta fagioli was not. It was reminiscent of nights I'm pressed for time and make soup from canned stuff. A can of beans, a can of tomatoes, some ditalini, a can of broth, and sauteed onions and celery. The sauteed veggies were still crunchy, they weren't cooked through. After adding a ton of cholula hot sauce it was just ok. Soup was dropped at the table and the food runner vanished before we noticed there were no spoons.

I had veggie balls, he had beef meat balls. My veggie balls were FREAKING AMAZING. I got them with pesto over beans and greens. The greens were good, the beans were the same as in my soup. But the balls, fantastic. His meatballs over spaghetti had a Parmesan cream sauce he loved.

So the food - mostly a hit. The wait, not worth it. Catch them at a slow time, or spend your money someplace else.

Our server was nice and did the best you could hope with a big party of starving (mostly) Italians who REALLY wanted to eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place before the Trailer Park Boys show and were both wholly satisfied with the choice. We chose the Emporio. The atmosphere was cool, the beer choices were plentiful, and the food was amazing. As an appetizer we shared the fried pickles with bacon ranch dip. I wasn't expecting to like them but I couldn't keep my hands out of the bowl, they were delicious. I had a bowl of pasta fagioli as well, which was entirely unnecessary but pretty good. We both got poutine topped with spicy pork meatballs and mushroom gravy as our entree, and that was enough for us to decide we would be coming back. Best meatballs I've ever eaten, and the first time I've ever eaten poutine, so the bar is set pretty high for any future poutine ventures. We ordered the ricotta doughnuts for dessert; they were super soft inside, lightly crisp on the outside, covered in powdered sugar with a side of fudge. Overall our experience was fantastic and we will definitely be coming back! We are both interested in trying out the beer garden next time too!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service. The balls are delicious & I enjoy the daily balls too... always something new. Prices are really reasonable. Cocktails aren't as fancy as other places, but they've got a decent selection. Looking forward to them carrying arsenal ciders! :-)"}
{"text":"I was enjoying a lovely evening on my vacation during the NCECA Conference and me and a friend decided to go out and grab a drink. We stumbled upon this cute little place with a rooftop bar with a fun and trendy atmosphere. We were enjoying our drinks and we each had a few sips left when an employee walked by and prematurely swept our drinks away. I felt extremely disrespected as neither I or my friend were asked about the status on our drinks. Have fun but be cautious as you may find yourself blindsided just as I was. What once was a lovely evening on my last night in Pittsburgh is now a night were I feel cheated of a good time and a good brew."}
{"text":"The wife and I went here for lunch before the Home and Garden show and I have to say that I was impressed. I like the idea of a restaurant that has a different theme on each level. I don't believe that all the levels are open yet but we did get a chance to eat at Emporio. 

Emporio's thing is meatballs and reminds me a bit of Franktuary in that they have a focus to their food and that food is meant to be ordered in multiples. Franktuary has their hotdogs and Emporio has it's Meatballs. 

You can of course order other things other than meatballs but you can also add  meatballs to pretty much anything which is great fun as well. 

The meatballs were very good and can be made with different ingredients and be accompanied by serval different sauce. So you pick your ball and your sauce and then your dish you want that sauce and meatballs to be placed in. I had the sliders and it was delicious. 

I feel the sides were plenty big to share so don't go overboard ordering too many of them. Had the mac and cheese and it was delicious as well 

Give it a go, it's a great place grab a bite if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Service was good and quick. It is a little noisy ambience. The place is neat and we were seated immediately. 

We first went to the rooftop bar first while waiting for the other people in the group to arrive. It is a fun environment and I highly recommend it if you are looking for an outdoor experience in the middle of downtown sorrounded by tall buildings.

This definitely looked like a great place with very good reviews and the group I went with enjoyed the food. However, I didn't really like the food. Part of the reason is the trouble I had with ordering the food since I am neither a meat ball not a pasta person. So, it was not easy for me to find a dish I could order. I ended up ordering poutine with tater tots and fried egg. The egg was delicious. I liked the tater tots, but i hope I had asked them to add less cheese. 

I might go back to this place and try something else next time."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a recent visit to Pittsburgh.  First, the doors were wide open and it was at least 80 degrees and very humid in the restaurant (90 degree day in August) but it was just about the only place open for dinner late at night.  We asked the waiter for a table in a \"cool\" (meaning, with some AC) spot in the restaurant - i would hate to see what the other options were.  We ordered a variety of starters to try - the cheesy bread, pickle chips and Caesar salad.  the cheesy bread was ok, literally just crusty bread with some cheese and marinara for dipping, i wouldn't order it again. the pickle chips had no taste except that of salt.  we probably each had one bite and then pushed it to the side of the table to forget about.  the Caesar salad was actually really good, yet simple.  the dressing tasted slightly lemony and i really enjoyed it.  i then tried a single turkey meatball slider which was, again, just ok.  the meatball itself had no flavor, but the marinara packs a punch.  we had a lot of leftover food but the waiter never inquired about whether anything was ok or asked how the food was.  the only thing that i would order again was the salad, which means I probably won't be returning to Sienna Mercato."}
{"text":"Well that was different...a meatball joint. Now this is not necessarily an Italian thing but, I actually judge an Italian restaurant by their meatballs....that's how important they are to me. So it's almost not fair that I walked into a strictly meatball joint... because it's not an Italian restaurant making meatballs, it's a meatball joint making what they make. A little confusing, right? No harm done. The open front of the restaurant and tables practically outside called to me before I even figured out what this place was.

Well now, on my Meatball Meter, if this place was strictly an Italian restaurant, I would not have been impressed. The meatballs were better than good but not \"oh my god\". In all fairness, I only had the beef but you have a choice of 3 others including vegetarian, turkey and spicy pork. Perhaps pork next time. 

I ordered the grinder and my wife and daughter ordered the sliders. I had beef with \"Sunday Gravy\" sauce (a marinara). The sauce is a second criterion I use and again it was better than good but not \"wow\". Understand that I am biased and make my own sauce. I like it salty and with a lot of basil. At the recommendation of our server, Taylor, I had chosen smoked gouda as the topper instead of provolone or american. This really tied the sandwich together and the bread was better than excellent on my scale, hearty, crisp outside and soft inside. The gouda saved the sandwich. My wife had the mushroom gravy on beef meatballs and she rather enjoyed it.

Salad was excellent, a balsamic vinegarette (chosen from 5 or so choices) which had a kick to it. Definitely delivered. It was over arugula with tomatoes, fresh mozz and sliced almonds. This was a wow salad. Some pene on the side perfectly al dente but with the Sunday gravy which was suitable. Just wish it was a little saltier.

Overall, the atmosphere, presentation, everything was a great experience and, though each quality would have been 3 or 4, the sum total scores a 4 overall for me. We would come back just for the ambiance. Prices not too shabby either. Just under $50 for 3 people including tax and tip."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes based on other reviews, but ultimately I was left a bit disappointed.  Perhaps it was a result of having my expectations set too high based on the feedback of others, but I was not impressed.

Atmosphere - 8/10 - very cool decor with open air front, reclaimed wood and rustic decor throughout.  I really like the vibe in here.  The only downside was that, when seated near to the sidewalk with the front windows all of the way up, the sidewalk is the de facto smoking area and I was constantly getting mouthfuls of hot and humid cigarette smoke.  Nothing SM can really do about that, but it still gets -1 point.

Service - 5/10 - agree with one of the other reviewers that the seemingly \"anything goes\" vibe in terms of waitstaff clothing was a bit odd.  I didn't see anything too outrageous, but it definitely classed the place down a little bit.  I'm not expecting Ceviche here, but being able to quickly identify your server vs. a patron is kind of a necessity.  I also just didn't get the warm and friendly vibe from a single person (hostess, host, server, or otherwise). Granted, they were busy, but you should never be too busy to provide great service.  Lastly, your menu has no description of what is in the meatballs or what the sauces are.  Either provide a side menu with basic descriptions or incorporate that into the server's table greeting.  Whatever you do, don't A) be annoyed when we ask questions or B) give one word answers because you're busy.

Food - 4/10 - really blown away by the 4 and 5 star reviews on this one.  My wife got the sliders and tried 3 different varieties. I got the panini with the meatball of the day.  When you base your concept around a single thing, you better be pretty good at it.  This was just average.  I want to be blown away with how good the meatballs or the sauce are, but I just wasn't.  The food wasn't very hot either, and the cheese on the entrees wasn't even melted.  It seemed they had rushed it through the broiler or oven because they were busy.  Disappointing :(

Price - 8/10 - for the location, very reasonable.  

I wish I could give this a 2.5 star because it just wasn't quite a 3 for me.  If either the food or service improve only slightly I would have given it 3 stars."}
