{"text":"Used this company to do all my taxes for 2012. This company made so many mistakes and filed incorrect numbers. I was audited and spent many phone calls and hours trying to fiqure out the mess they made. I explained to Roslyn Saul and she wanted $800 to help me with the audit on top of the over $6000 I paid to have my taxes prepared. They made the errors and they were not there to explain them to Revenue Canada. I will be taking them to small claims court in the near future. I thought I was hiring professionals to do my taxes but I was wrong."}
{"text":"I have never been motivated to write a bad review.  Nothing bothers me more to hear promises just to take my deposit and then excuses after excuse to why my taxes have not been filed.  March 2nd walking home I see this mascot  advertising liberty tax.  So we walk in and greeted with a beautiful smile and we will be right with you by a lady Rosalyn Valentine Saul.  My fiance and I where reassured that our taxes where not difficult and that it was pretty straight forward.  In her own words \"this is what we do \"  \"we will take care of you\"  today is the day I went into the office to get our deposit because our taxes have NOT been filed.  today is April 24th.  apparently I had to go in and sign a document so that she could go ahead and file but if you do the math it took her almost 2 month to tell me this or maybe she is taking peoples money and over loading herself with new customers that now we don't matter.  I wonder how many deposits she has taken.  I called head office and they where very nice I hope they investigate because John D's comment sounds what was starting to happen to me but like a pro I pulled out just in time.  Nearly 2 month is a long time to wait to have your taxes filed.  Thanks but no thanks I need my Taxes filed THIS year."}
{"text":"I've been going to this branch of Liberty Tax for a few years now and I have been really impressed with the service and accuracy of my taxes.  I have a lot of business expenses and Rosalyn always helps me understand how to file properly.  I highly recommend their services and plan to use them again this year for my taxes."}
{"text":"Simply put, a poorly run business. Taxes were done incorrectly, took longer to complete than what they said it would, and the guy made it clear he was happy to put as little effort into being helpful as possible when I arrived to the business venue."}
{"text":"FOLLOW UP..........Since my last post I have been called in to the office, by ROSLYN SAUL VALENTINE's staff, Bob, only to be made to conduct my business on the sidewalk!  I was offered  a cheque in my common law husbands name.  We didn't pay by cheque, WE PAID CASH!!! and we want our cash back! We DON'T trust her.  She is NEVER in her office, and they ALWAYS keep their door LOCKED.  I have attempted to have this matter settled NUMEROUS times and this unprofessional, immature avoidance of the inevitable is equivalent to a tantrum by a unpolished woman pretending to be something she isn't in a world that she, quite simply is not well suited for. Customer Service.  This whole outfit is SHADY!!  Last week Bob told me he quit...he's still there this week, and she is STILL in hiding?? Last week Bob tried to tell me that she said, \"it's now too late to get my money back, because it's been more that 30 days\". I told him BULLSHIT, I WANT MY CASH!! Today they try to send my husband the same cheque I refused a month ago in the mail with a letter trying to critizing me and then telling him not to come into the office to talk about this letter or any other business!! She included a copy of my previous post of their business ethics...like he wouldn't know!???  Shame! Inside the letter, with the cheque were Merv's tax papers that should have been returned to him when I picked his WRONG taxes up, which is what started this whole mess off in the beginning, they did Merv's taxes wrong, and when I returned to the office to say something, Bob was about to fix them, when ROSLYN SAUL VALENTINE jumped in with insults about whether I had even finished high school, and went on to call me a welfare *itch, I replied, ``never mind fixing the taxes, I`ll take my money back!``  She didn`t like that.  I don`t lose my cool too often, but this ``woman`` and her dog are both the nastiest things I have met in a LONG time.  This ``woman`` SHOULD NOT be in the service industry, and that dog is not trained or suited for the public!  Then she spent the next TWO MONTHS avoided me!!! To my defense I am college educated, and have worked ALL my life.  I am presently disabled with a service dog, that was attacked by ROSLYN SAUL VALENTINE`s untrained dog, when we entered the business, and during our stay.  I live on WSIB after a car accident while working at Canada Post, I suffer with a broken neck, and a ripped rotator cuff.  I also collect a widows pension.  I am small, but she picked on the wrong little old lady this time!! I want this situation rectified with CASH in my HAND!! I DEMAND an APOLOGY from this \"woman\".  An apology for how she treated me originally AND for how she has continued to abuse me by not dealing with this situation in a professional and timely manner AND now AGAIN  for sending a letter to my own home criticizing me to my own spouse!!  And the LIES!! The absolute NERVE.  I have this woman on video!! I have her staff on video!! Lying to me!! Telling me the taxes had been sent two days ago and I couldn't get the taxes or my money back!!!  Then I was called back into the office to and asked to sign papers AGAIN to RESEND the taxes the WERE NOT sent, and this was done in THE LAUNDRY MAT!!! Beside their business while I'm attempting to complete my laundry!! I have on video them telling me ALL my documents had been returned to me, this week I receive a cheque in the wrong name (AGAIN) with ALL MY DOCUMENTS!!!!  DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY. THEY DO NOT KNOW THE TRUTH!!!  Only accept cash for any refunds the you deserve as they are obviously a NOT TRUSTWORTHY.  This Branch is TERRIBLE but I believe they must be a reflection of the WHOLE COMPANY as the company is ALLOWING such a person to treat THEIR clients so disgracefully and use their name without ANY intervention or reprimand, and that is paramount to condoning the behaviour.  If this situation wasn't handled within one month the Head Office should have stepped in and MADE SURE it was dealt with.  I think she is avoiding having to APOLIGIZE to me! How small is that?  Won't PAY me the CASH they OWE me, or give me the apology I deserve.  Small people, Small company.  Save YOUR money GO SOMEWHERE ELSE....ANYWHERE ELSE!!!"}
