{"text":"Came here for poutine week and loved this \"all-in\" poutine that comes with sausage and chicken schnitzel on top of a generous portion of poutine. I believe this is part of the regular menu, and can be ordered in a small or large. I really loved the different meat \"toppings\" on this poutine. Need a break from fries and cheese? Have a bite of a delicious smoked sausage or fried chicken cutlet, and then go back to your fries and cheese. Repeat cycle until the plate is licked clean. There are other poutine options (as well as burgers), and although I didn't take notes or photos of the menu (d'oh!) I remember thinking the other poutines sounded creative and well thought-out. 

The place is relatively small (I believe about 4-6 tables which seat between 2-4 people each, and a 4-seat \"bar stool\" counter). 

It's not the most convenient place to get to and will likely require a bus + metro. But if you drive, plenty of free parking outside!!"}
{"text":"Super bouffe et super atmosphère et super service. Ils on gagner le première prix à Drummondville pour leur Poutine en 2015.

Great food and great atmosphere. Great service. They won the greatest poutine  award at the 2015 Drummondville poutine fest."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I came here a few weeks ago for the All You Can Eat Poutine. 
Although the location is pretty far away from downtown, this place is worth coming to! The poutine was fantastic. We also tried the deep fried Oreos, which I would highly recommend. The decor is rustic and modern. There is a large amount of seating and the staff are more than happy to accommodate large groups. 

One of my favourite poutines. I can't wait to experience more of their awesome menu.

Le Gras Dur, I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Was here for dinner last night. We arrived at around 6:50-7 when normally a restaurant would turn away customers so close to closing time but they were so gracious enough as to serve us anyways. So a huge plus right there.

I had the Cheeseburger and the fries with sausage and spicy mayo. The cheeseburger was great, you could really taste the fresh beef and the pretzel bun was really good. The fries were perfectly crispy and well seasoned while the pieces of sausage on top were fantastic. I have no doubt they leverage local ingredients.

Speaking of local products, my friends had the maple cola which tasted very good, not overpowering with the maple flavor but still enough of a hint to distinguish it from a regular off the shelf cola.

Overall was impressed with the quality of the food. The place has a cool wood cabin vibe. It only seats roughly 20 people. And again really appreciated that they took our orders despite arriving so close to closing time."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon at 3 pm is when we drove by and decided to stop because we seen it advertised online before when they do the oyster mania.

The place was empty and that was perfect, very neat and tidy. We were greeted by a tall man who gave us our menu and came by Quickly to take our order.

We shared the large schnitzel poutine 
And the nutty pig burger with of course two white beers.

Poutine was perfect, big cold curd cheese chunks with very crispy thin slices of schnitzel on top. For two people a large is perfect but I would suggest sharing something else.

The burger was good but I didn't know it had Nutella which was a nice surprise I never tried the two together before. Of course it had bacon because as soon as you walk in the words bacon are big on the wall. It came together nicely on a warm pretzel bun.

I love that the covered the window facing the alley with newspaper articles about their food trucks and the resto it makes it a lot more pleasant to look at. There's a popcorn machine by the bathrooms you just gotta take a bucket and fill it up your self and take it back with you.

This place was really good and would for sure come back.

Gotta try the root beer pickles next time :)"}
{"text":"Pas mal, j'y suis allé dans le cadre du oysterfest et j'ai pris le burger oyster que j'ai bien aimé! Ca venait avec un verre de bière pour 10$ le tout, ce qui est très raisonnable!
Seul hic de cette place, c'est un peu loin du métro!!
Par contre, la bouffe avait l'air bonne, le cadre est sympa, et il n'y avait pas trop de monde (jeudi soir)"}
{"text":"Miam!!
C'est un resto parfait pour du \"junk food\" de grande qualité.
Le
Menu est original, décadent et gras dur à souhait!
Le bacon est à l'honneur jusque dans les dessert...  Oui oui, il y a même du pouding chômeur au bacon!!!
La poutine y est excellent 
Un point fort du Gras Dur est que tout est fait sur place avec des ingrédients de qualité.
En plus, le personnel est super sympathique!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Le Gras Dur's website while looking for a food truck to cater my midnight table. After reaching out to Annie, the owner, I was pleased with how responsive and dedicated she seemed- ever since I started planning my wedding, I've gotten used to being treated like a number so I was happy with my experience so far. My fiancé and I decided to come by to try the food before committing to a deposit.

Annie and her staff warmly welcomed us on a Friday evening. The vintage chairs and wooden tables gave off a rustic feel that fit the comfort food menu perfectly. 90's music blasted through the speakers. They proudly displayed an impressive number of awards won in festivals across the province, which doesn't surprise me because the food was delicious! We stuffed our faces with the chicken schnitzel burger, smoked meat burger with beef angus patty, fried eggplant burger, cheeseburger poutine, seafood poutine, grilled cheese... Highlights were the Gras Dur grilled cheese with truffle oil mushrooms, seafood poutine covered in a bisque sauce, chicken schnitzel burger and the regular poutine made with a bacon onion sauce. That sauce! I can't wait to dig into that poutine on my wedding night. 

I wish I had tried their cocktails! Instead, I discovered a lovely local bubbly called Les bulles de Gabrielle that was very reasonably priced. I'd totally come back here on a cheat day, even though I don't live in the area."}
{"text":"Décadent! 
Bouffe hyper réconfortante! 
Pas cher. Ambiance sympathique et décontractée! 
Poutine aux fruits de mer: merveilleux, mais manque de sauce.
Cheeseburger enrobé de bacon: attention aux artères!"}
{"text":"Belle place pour manger des classiques comme de la poutine ou des burgers mais avec la touche d'originalité qu'on retrouve dans nos food trucks préférés. Le restaurant n'a pas beaucoup de tables mais on s'y sent bien. Les milkshakes sont aussi vraiment bons. Il ne manque plus qu'une option végé au menu régulier :)
Merci à eux de mettre en avant les marques locales !"}
{"text":"Went today for lunch since I was craving for some poutine (it is Poutine Week after all). Had the Touski poutine, which is a poutine  with smoke stuffed sausage, chicken schnitzel, and braised cabbage. The poutine was good, really liked the chicken, but it is not a ''special'' poutine (it is available all year long at their restaurant and food truck). So I was a bit disappointed. 
I also had the burger with a pretzel bun, thought it was amazing, even though it was quite small.
Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Dans le top des meilleurs tartares que j'ai mangé! Leurs burgers sont satisfaisants, les salades, rafraichissantes et l'ambiance est très chouette. L'emplacement est un peu loin de tout, mais vaut le détour! Et en ce moment, les poutines sont à volonté dès 17h du lundi au mercredi!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot in Jarry street. The decor is cozy and charming. We went for the brunch; arrived at noon and it was empty. Only one other customer and her kid were eating. The 3 of us ordered classics breakfast: eggs, meat and toasts. It took almost 25-30 minutes to get our plates. It's kinda very long for brunch in an empty restaurant. The food was very very very salty for me, even tho I'm a salty girl. I had the ham and the baked beans I couldn't with my eggs and I couldn't finish because it was too salty. The prices are high. 2 eggs with potatoes, one choice of meat and toast is around 7$. The extra baked beans was 3$. The portion are not small but really not big. The service was...how can I say it..blah? Slow, nonchalant and just not too interested. I don't think I'd go back soon or ever."}
{"text":"Guilty experience pour les souvenirs carnivores... rassasiant et gouteux.
Petite place avec décor simple mais recherché pour une ambiance d'étable."}
