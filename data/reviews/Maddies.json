{"text":"I hesitate to admit I've been here. My friends enjoy spending their birthday's here and I'm not sure why. Maybe because of dozens of Q102 ads for Maddie's in Malvern? There is usually a manageable cover around 8 bucks give or take a little. I've always seen live music which is why they are getting 2 stars. People seem to dance in interesting ways... especially the \"older\" crowd, I'm just saying. I have nothing against a place that welcomes people of all ages and well I guess it is quite entertaining.   Maybe I've lived away from the area too long but I hate indoor smoking. Ugh. There's nothing worse than leaving a bar and reeking of every type of cigarette there is. I have nothing against smokers but I would just prefer people to do it in non enclosed places like Maddie's."}
{"text":"So many sketchy nights spent here. I saw a drunk man accidentally burn myself and several women with a cigarette, trying to get them to dance with him. I saw fights outside when the place was closing for the night. My good friend had a drink poured on her here (she wasn't a fan.) Ah. What memories. And there were many nights spent playing pool in a room with no ventilation, filled with people smoking. I wanted to claw my eyes out by the end of the night. And yet again, and again, I went back for more."}
{"text":"I've gone here for after happy hour drinks a few times and have to say its decent.   Its a bar yes, and it does have bar food and it is good.   When i go to a bar and want bar food I want wings, nachos, fries etc...things that are enjoyable while having a beer!  I do not want brie, or other snooty food.   This place is good for what it is.    And another important fact if you do get lucky while chatting it up at the bar there is a hotel next store...saves you from having to drive :)"}
{"text":"I know it's wrong, but the thing that draws me to Maddie's is the opportunity to watch old people dance uncontrollably.  As you may have noticed from other reviews of mine, people watching is on top of my favorite hobbies, and Maddie's is one of the epicenters for this calling.  During the winter Maddies is utterly useless.  The food is below average, the bar is boring and the people are not as crazy.  But once those 80 degree July nights roll around, the huge outside deck opens up and so do 45 year old's inhibitions.  They have some decent specials and some average cover bands, which make Maddies an attractive novelty in this sleepy town."}
{"text":"As Russ alluded to, Maddie's is a popular \"cougar\" hangout for you younger fellas looking to meet \"Mrs. Robinson\" if you get my drift. The rest of you will find the restaurant average and the bar tiresome. It does get \"hopping\" on summer nights but unless you're looking for a sugar momma or a boy next door you might prefer The Boathouse (http://www.yelp.com/biz/boathouse-too-inc-malvern#hrid:8ot_URez6OzQapuDbcs6cw) ."}
{"text":"The service was fine, the food was good.  There was a sushi menu, which I was tempted to try, but decided not to.  There was nothing really exciting about the place on a Thursday night.  Overall Maddies didn't impress me, but there was nothing wrong with it."}
