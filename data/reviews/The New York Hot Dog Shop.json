{"text":"This is an AWESOME place for a great lunch!!! It's a family owned business that treat their customers like family! Such a friendly place!"}
{"text":"Nice little diner type establishment. Everything is home made. Very customer friendly. In business 40 years. I enjoyed the homemade chili. Nice spice. Food gets made as you wait. Different soups everyday as well. Highly recommended. Great to support a family owned establishment!"}
{"text":"A lot of good reviews here....  Staff friendly etc.  Went to restaurant half hour before closing...  We were meet by a staff that seemed irritated to serve us.  We felt pressured to the point that we just ordered one hot dog and left.  Note:  If you don't want to work until close and past to clean-up.  Close earlier!  Don't make the customer feel uncomfortable about getting out."}
{"text":"Great place! A hidden gem in the north hills of Pittsburgh. Super friendly staff. Good old fashioned home cooked delicious food. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Put me down for some good old fashioned Coney Island style hot dogs any day. Sure they're cheap to make at home, but they're almost as cheap at some of the best hot dog shops in town.  Come here and get your basic dog and a side of fries, and go home happy. This place is exactly what it should be and what you'd expect it to be and he ladies behind the counter are super friendly to boot."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best hot dog chili in existence. Good homemade potato salad or good fries.   Get the hot dog with everything (including a nice slice of dill pickle).  I've been going here for almost 30 years, stopping after kids sporting events and now just about every time I'm in the area. They also have a great breakfast but I'm usually not in the area at that time and hot dogs aren't ready until lunch"}
{"text":"worst service ever!!!!!!!!!!! wouldn't recommend to anyone. I can't even review the food because we never even got it!!!! Absolutely Ridiculous"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a small child. The waitresses are soooo nice and their food is great too! It is cash only so be prepared :) I don't have anything bad to say! Great place."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the cleanest restaurants i have been in.  The owner is delightful, knows her customers and their family. I was visiting a local (brother in law) And we went there.  Soup delish sandwich perfect.  It really like a NY diner.  The owner had delicious Greek pastry out for Christmas and insisted we tried."}
{"text":"Stopped by NYHDS based on the Yelp! Reviews and proximity to where we were staying.  Great little hot dog joint. Employees were super friendly and accommodating.  Service was spot on. $1.65 chili dogs!  Chili dogs were kinda of small, but for $1.65, get TWO! And they were delicious.  My wife got the homemade chicken noodle soup and I got the Ruben special.  Enjoyed everything!  Would definitely recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"No establishment can possibly bring back more nostalgia for me than the New York Hot Dog. For nearly 40 years, this unassuming little diner has been serving up breakfasts, lunches,  shakes, floats, fries and, of course, their ubiquitous hot dogs.  Order yours, \"with everything\" if you're feeling adventurous, or pick from a plethora of toppings and condiments.  The decor hasn't changed much, with mustard walls and vinyl seating predominant, along with ancient globe light fixtures...but its all part of the retro charm.  Friendly service too!  Take out is available but an ATM is not, so bring cash to this cash only joint."}
{"text":"The hot dogs are the best around!!! The owners had a shop on the Northside years ago. Made the best dogs there too!"}
{"text":"There's something about a hot dog shop that actually has the words 'hot dog shop' in its title that makes it feel that much more authentic.  I have been near this place many times, but never had the time to stop in until recently.  I am so happy that I did, it satisfied my craving I was having that day for a nice plump hot dog.  I came in close to the end of their day, but more than enough time to enjoy a quick meal before I headed out to complete my tasks at hand.  I was greeted warmly by the busy-as-bees ladies behind the counter and decided to sit up at the diner-esque counter.  They let me sit for a bit so I could collect myself and look over the menu.  After a few minutes I decided on an order of two chili dogs and some shoestring fries.  It wasn't long and they were working away at the grill.  Now if you want a show, sit at the countertop near the entrance.  You get to see how fast they make sure that order is coming at you.  Even though they had many orders called in for take out, that did not stop them from preparing a fairly hefty plate of food for me.  Two freshly plumped hot dogs hot off the grill place in a freshly steamed bun and then topped with their own chili, add to that a nice sized serving of shoestring fries and the plate was full.  I didn't want to look greedy, so I took my time devouring that first hot dog.  I didn't want to ruin it in any way, so I ate it as is.  The hot dog had great taste and the bun was soft as could be, but the real star of each bite was the chili.  This isn't that typical, runny, greasy chili that you receive at just about every place you go, and it's not one that has big chunks in it either.  I am not sure on the exact contents of spices that were thrown together for this chili, but the one thing I can tell you for sure is that you will not forget it for a while after you finish it.  It leaves your lips tingling, you know that pleasant tingle you get when each time you lick you lips afterwards you still get that little bit of sting.  I have eaten many a chili dog in my days and this chili was by far the best.  The shoestring fries were a perfect side for this, not too starchy or salty, just a nice compliment.   For the serving I had, the price wasn't bad at all.  A little over five dollars for two chili dogs and an order of shoestring fries.  A pleasant, calming stop on an extraordinary day.  I will definitely come back here, if not for the food then for the charm.  I do have a confession, I did stop here once before, but I had to immediately turn around and leave.  It wasn't because of any of the thoughts you might be having, but merely because I hadn't any cash on me.  Yes, that means this is a cash only establishment.  Which makes for faster service at a high speed place."}
{"text":"The New York Hot Dog Shop is a step back into the past.  Ancient decor, counter seating, and a menu posted to the wall.  The menu is simple, but everything is delicious.  The waitresses are friendly and efficient, and you cannot beat the prices.  Hotdog w/ Chili ($1.50):  it's a standard hot dog, but WOW! is the chilli here good.  It's clearly made with love and care.  And depending on who makes it, it can be mild or crazy hot.  But it's always good!  Cheeseburger ($2.00):  I don't know why, but these cheeseburgers are always tasty.  It's simple but good.  They do charge extra for tomato and lettuce.  Cheesesteak ($3.50):  Amazing and the best deal on the menu.  Cooked perfectly, big, and filling.  Vanilla Milkshake:  It's a great shake, and they serve it to you in the silver tin!  So it's enough for two milkshakes really.  Additionally, the people that work here and run this place are awesome.  They know everyone by name, get to know you if they don't already, and work really hard.  Make the effort and check this shop out!"}
{"text":"Charming little diner where I had fantastic friendly service and a really good hot dog and fries. The owner and staff make you feel right at home and as if you are a regular. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Today I had the pleasure of taking my boys to the hotdog shop. As soon as we walked in we were taken back in time to the diners of my childhood. L-shaped counter seating with tiny booths made the room welcoming. We were immediately greeted and asked to sit anywhere we want. The diner was filled with mailman, police officers and Township workers! I always say eat where the locals eat. For lunch we ordered a bowl of chicken noodle soup, my sons favorite. My other son ordered battered french fries and a grilled hotdog.  I  Had a very simple cheese burger on a plain bun and it was great!  The people working behind the counter were absolutely some of the friendliest people I have met in a while. Helping out with suggestions and answering all of our questions. They have daily lunch specials that range from grilled salmon to brisket. The specials range in price from 5.99 to 8.99. They are only open till 3 PM so do not plan to have dinner there. They also only take cash. Our whole meal with drinks and a tip was $15. There are not many places left I can take three people out to lunch for five dollars a person.   If you're driving down 19 and looking for a nice bite be sure to stop here. This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Great food exceptional price value.  Friendly service, no CC. Highly recommended for good old fashioned hot dogs and home cooked meals."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs around since Toula's on the northside.   I drive out at least once a month.  The owner is fantastic."}
{"text":"Very cute family owned breakfast and lunch diner. My family has gotten to know the owners over the years and they are the some of the nicest and most genuine people we know. If you're considering coming here, you definitely should :)"}
{"text":"Great little diner fo lunch.  Friendly staff and cheap food.  I always stick with the hot dogs with chili and cheese and a cheeseburger.  Great milkshakes too! Bring cash!"}
