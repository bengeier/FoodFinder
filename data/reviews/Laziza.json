{"text":"This place is classy and reasonably priced. Definitely the best fine dining in Kent.  The hummus and Shawarma are to die for! Nice selection of wine and exceptional service. I will be frequenting here often! Reservations on the weekends are suggested. Fyi"}
{"text":"Delicious food and super friendly staff. Fresh and tasty ingredients. Great service. I highly recommend Laziza!!"}
{"text":"This is probably your best shawarma option between Christie and Dufferin. I'd say better than the shop at Ossington & Bloor because the sandwich is bigger and the seating is better.

I had the chicken shawarma sandwich and I'd go back for another.

The chicken was nicely spiced, the toppings were fresh and generous and the final wrap had a nice heft.

Staff were friendly (\"Hey, boss!\") and the price was right.

Sufficient seating, and tables at the front are good for watching people, or watching sandwich-making.

Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"I live out of town and was pleasantly surprised when I came home to see downtown growing and adding a restaurant like laziza! The food, service and atmosphere were great! I would definitely recommend ordering something Mediterranean off of the menu because that is their specialty. You won't be disappointed. Also they suggested a Mediterranean wine that was wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Excellent and consistent Mediterranean food.  Falafel, kibbie, shish tawook, and kafta kabobs are good choices,and the makluba is excellent.   Their hummus is always overpowered with lemon, so I avoid it on its own and any menu items that contain it.  Unlike the food, the service is very inconsistent and ranges from engaged and knowledgeable to flighty and forgetful, although it has improved quite a bit recently."}
{"text":"A brilliant addition to the Acorn Alley area. The food is delicious with just the right amount of Mediterranean flavor and spice to suit the average American palate. The staff is friendly and efficient, offering helpful recommendations and tasty pairings. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Located in downtown Kent in Ohio, this Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant was absolutely delicious and so fresh. And the service was excellent. I highly recommend it. We were a large group of people and shared many dishes and all were incredibly good!"}
{"text":"My husband is Lebanese so we are a hard sell. This restaurant is very reasonable and yet extremely chic and tasteful. The food was perfect and presented in very creative ways. The dishes (square, teardrop shaped etc) were well chosen.

Of course the number one test is the food and all was faithful to the recipes, just presented creatively.  The shwarma was set on a bed of rice, or hummus and was seasoned perfectly.  Deserts were perfect. Try the namura!

The owner is attentive, and circulates, talking to the patrons. The Lebanese are extremely caring of clientele and it shows.  You can feel free to discuss the menu with him.  The turkish coffee, rich and aromatic.

I cook all this at home so if I want to go out and eat this food, it has to be a total positive experience and this is it. I will go back."}
{"text":"The worst Kabab dish i ever ate was in this restaurant. Maybe you can try something else but not meat."}
{"text":"Graduation was a bust our party waited over 2 hours for our food. This place use to be one of the better spots in kent. After our experience McDonald's holds more Value to us. I won't waste my time and energy writing anything else lastly go somewhere else that knows how to cook and run a functional restaurant. Two big thumbs down"}
{"text":"Loved the chicken shawarma plate! I like how the chicken & potatoes were a bit crispy. Also, the portion was A LOT! Friendly staff too ;)"}
{"text":"The worst meal I've had in 10 years. Terrible hospitality and food. Very slow table service and then was brought the wrong order. Food was not fresh and stale. And this place is expensive too. We'll not be going back ever."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Laziza's on 1/23/2015 around 2 pm.  We had heard great things about this restaurant and found ourself in Kent so thought why not give it a try.  The place is beautiful and very appealing.  Unfortunately, the food was not.  
I ordered Makluba and was very disappointed.  The chicken had been cooked hours ahead and so had the vegetables.  To add insult to injury the vegetables were stone cold.  The waitress took the dish back to the kitchen where the staff nuked it and brought it out .  The dish was terrible.  My husband had  the Chicken Shawarna.  It would have been very good if the chicken had not been made hours ago.  The rice on both plates was dried out and hard to  chew.  I told the waitress that I thought the food was dry and had obviously been made hours ago.  She was a very sweet girl and asked if I wanted to talk with the manager.  I said no because really if a restaurant would serve that food I personally thought
why bother.  We will never return."}
{"text":"Took my friend out to Laziza who was visiting from out of town, we had a bit of a wait, so I'd recommend seeing about reservations. The staff was absolutely on point and very curtious & caring. The atmosphere is great with a 2nd story seating area in addition to the main floor. White linen tables and a higher end atmosphere make this a great place for any night or a special occasion. You also get what you pay for, the prices are higher but the quality of the food and drinks are absolutely excellent. It was a great evening!"}
{"text":"I booked a reservation over a month in advance because it was for a graduation celebration. The reservation was confirmed by mid week, which would mean that Laziza was prepared for that evening. That opinion was the farthest thing from the truth. When we sat down, the waitress almost immediately told us that it would be at least a 45 minute wait for our orders to come out upon ordering. At that point, we had no options-because it was getting late and we had 10 people in our party. The restaurant was not totally packed but was busy. Right before the waitress was going to take our orders, we were told that one of the specials-lamb shank-was not available. That disappointed 3 people in our party. We finally ordered and some people ordered lentil soup,which arrived fairly quick. But the 3 French onion soups arrived 10 minutes later-watered down&uneatable! Dinner arrived at least 75-90 min. after we ordered. The owner/manager came to the table a few times and was not bothered by our exceptionally long wait. Other parties that night waited over 2 hours for dinner. Totally unacceptable since they knew far enough in advance. Some of the dinners were overly spicy & people complained the next day. It took an act of G-d to get the 3 French onion soups off the bill but no other compensation or remorse was shown by the owner that evening. Considering that there are but a few \"event\"type restaurants in Kent, this  establishment really took advantage of our party that evening. We will never go to Laziza again. I'll go out of my way to avoid this rip-off restaurant!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give this place a try for date night. We were very disappointed with the food. We are both vegetarians and ordered the Kabsa vegetarian and the mujadara and got similar plates of warm rice with vegetables that looked like they were defrosted.  We couldn't believe we spent $25 on rice and frozen veggies.  We could barely stomach our entrees and just laughed at one point bc it was so bland and pathetic . The appetizer of falafel was also way overcooked.  The positives are great drinks and service.  However, because the food was so bad we will never go there again.  Alladins food is way better and way cheaper."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time when I went to KSU. Well... once a month or so, because it was a little over my college student budget. But for me that was \"all the time\" for a restaurant like this.

I never had a bad experience here. Whether I was eating meat or doing the veg thing, it was ALWAYS delicious. The hummus here is to die for."}
{"text":"My spouse and several of her friends ate here this week.  Their appetizers were very good, but their dinners(lamb) on skewers was very tough, hard to cut and difficult to chew. They thought perhaps it was mutton instead of lamb.  It was the wine and good company that prevented more than one of them from returning their dinners to the kitchen.
   Service was good, great appetizers but way below expectations on the dinners."}
{"text":"Laziza is a recent and welcome addition to the Bloorcourt scene. It's worth checking out, but a couple of start up problems are holding it back from a higher rating. 

The food is mostly excellent. Along with the usual rice and potato offerings are unusual finds like roasted cauliflower, eggplant and zucchini. The salads are fresh and plentiful, with yummy tabbouleh, marinated cabbage, and chickpea options. 

The falafels are made fresh, as they should be, and are crisp on the outside and moist and flavourful on the inside. I highly recommend them. 

The kefta kabab is likewise made fresh and tastes fabulous, but a little bit of warning about the 15 minute wait would have been helpful as I was on a lunch break with limited time. 

The shop is clean, the staff are nice, and the garlic sauce is top notch. 

There are a few problems: 

My usual shawarma order is the beef plate, however the one time I tried it at Laziza, it was unfortunately fatty and gristly. A bad experience and I've never been able to bring myself to try it again. 

They have a large selection of baklava, but it doesn't seem to move very much so I question its freshness. Unfortunately, the staff was not able to tell me when it was made/purchased or even what kind of nuts were in it. 

The shop is always stiflingly hot. The huge open windows help, but it's uncomfortable and I feel terrible for the workers. 

The flow of customers through the space is a major issue. You enter, order, get shuffled back and forth to pick your items, and then go to back to pay and then squeeze out again past all the newcomers who are trying to order. On several occasions, people who came in later have been served before me or the staff has gotten confused as to which food belonged to which person. This is an issue that could easily be solved by simply making people pay and form line at the back of the shop, and then move through to pick their rice/potatoes/salad and leave through the front door. It sounds like a minor thing, but after you've shuffled around that small space a few times, you start shaking your head about why this simple fix hasn't been implemented. 

Overall, I've visited Laziza about half a dozen times and plan to return. I'm glad there's a decent shawarma place in the area now and I hope it will continue to improve."}
{"text":"I was so excited for a new Mediterranean restaurant in the area, but Laziza was tremendously disappointing. The service was slow, the servers (we got a new one part way through for some reason) were not educated about the food or the wine they were selling, and worst of all, the food was awful.

I ordered the salmon. At $19.00 you would expect salmon to come out of the kitchen perfectly cooked. It was white--I kid you not--and the whole piece was so hard and overdone that I was able to lift it in its entirety off my plate with one stab. To add insult to injury, the vegetables were cold, as they were of the frozen variety, and complete mush. 

For the first time in my life, I sent my whole meal back and (politely) let the server know that I didn't really want anything else from the kitchen. The meal was comped, but I was floored when no one came to apologize or talk to me or anything. 

So much for a celebration dinner! We went to Pita Pit afterward and I had a fan-freakin-tastic black bean pita with cucumber sauce, feta, and excellent service."}
{"text":"Not to be dramatic, but I would lay down my life for Laziza: Toronto's greatest falafel with a special on every damn day. They also have a secret weapon in the falafel whisperer himself, Moe. No one man should have this much skill when it comes to crafting the perfect wrap, but Moe is no mere man; he is one with the falafel, ensuring every bite is perfectly portioned with all of the ingredients. The potatoes are damn good too. But Moe is the shining star."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, healthy ingredients. The staff was nice too.

Only thing missing from giving this place 5 stars is it's missing the MMF factor."}
{"text":"At Laziza as I write this...have been here over an hour, still waiting for our dinner.  Took forever to get our salads and have now been informed that the kitchen is backed up and it may be quite some time for our dinner...REALLY??? We have already been here an hour and had to beg for our salads.  Ready to blow this place very soon.  McDonalds here we come!!!  Do NOT come here."}
{"text":"Pro: the falafel was the best I've ever had

Cons: inept and slow service, flavorless hummus and dawali, way overpriced. 8 bite sized falafel will run you $18. Ran out of bread and was told it would be a while. Then that they burned it all and it wouldn't be available til later in the night after we left. Aladdin's is a similar menu with way better pricing and service."}
{"text":"Didn't care for the hummus or the vegetarian grape leaves. Hummus was super acidic and just nothing special. Did enjoy the chicken and rice soup, had a really nice flavor. None of our hot food was really hot and nothing really wowed me. 
Our server wasn't that great, she totally forgot our bread and wasn't very attentive. 
Overall, I just wasn't super impressed with the food here, I've had better."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I went here for lunch and the place is simply amazing inside.  It's very welcoming and has a nice ambiance. They had soft music playing in the background and the decor is something out of a magazine. 

We were seated immediately.  There were a total of 4 people in at the time.  We only had 30 minutes to eat and we told our waiter that.

The service was ok. We didn't get a lot of attention, especially with it being so slow. My co-worker and I ordered the same thing, crab cakes and the vegetable of the day.  

Let's talk food! The waiter brought us out one meal at a time so we were completely confused and wondered if he thought we were splitting the same meal but after about 5 minutes he came back with another plate of veggies and said the second order of cakes were almost ready. I think he was doing us a favor since we were low on time but that message was never conveyed haha.

Anywho, once we both received the food, it was excellent. The crab cakes were soft and full of meat and they were decently sized. The vegetables were seasoned perfectly and soft just like I like them! No major complaints. I'll definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Service was very good as was the atmosphere.  Food was fine, but nothing special.  I would prefer the flatbreads be served warm rather than room temp (or chillier).  But orders were correct, nothing was awful, and we were with a fairly large group.  I would certainly give it another shot based on this experience and its intangibles."}
{"text":"My go to in this neighbourhood.  Everything I've tried is so good but the salads keep me coming back.  The staff is so friendly and treat everyone as though they were a regular."}
{"text":"Love Laziza! It's such a great restaurant in downtown Kent and a nice break from the regular bar food that you run into so often down there. They have awesome hummus and baba ghanoush (which is what we started with at our table, and it was delicious). Then I got an order of the Beef Schwarma. It was good, but I was not able to eat much of it because I cannot handle any type of anything that is even remotely spicy. It honestly wasn't even that spicy, but it has just enough of a kick to get to me. (My boyfriend gave it a 1 on a scale of 1 to 10 in terms of spiciness). So ended up switching entrees with my boyfriend, who got the shish kabobs, and those were absolutely fantastic. The rice there is so light and fluffy as well. I just can't get enough of it."}
{"text":"We went for a homecoming and the place was packed, we had heard wonderful things about it but it was extremely expensive and the service was poor. If you don't like Greek or seafood I would suggest you to find some where else to eat especially if you are a picky eater!"}
{"text":"This place has great ambience, solid service, and good wine and beer.  But the food is only so-so.  I was particularly disappointed in the falafel, which the owners should re-visit.  The kabobs are okay.  I think that for the price, the owners need to provide food that is better than Aladdin's, but the food here falls short,"}
{"text":"Had a great time here, Ameera the Bellydancer was a really nice bonus feature. The hummus was a good start, some of the better I've had recently. The main course was just ok, the chicken swarma wrap was a little spicy (to much) and the vegetable couscous had to much cinnamon and vinegar for the pallet to handle. Couscous had a boxed taste and the vegetables tasted old and mushy. The atmosphere was great and the wait staff point on. I would give them a second taste to see if this was just s bad cook nite."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh and delicious.  What a find.  Even our 8 year old was delighted with his meal."}
{"text":"Why would a lunch special be on the board at noon that wasn't available at 12:15? Why didn't the waitress come back to the table telling us that the chic gyro was not available? Why would the waitress assume that we wanted the substitute item she brought instead? Why didn't she ask us what we wanted instead? Why did the meat in both of our wraps taste like they were a day old? Why was the meat portion small? Why would we ever want to come back?"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner and appetizer. My wife is sitting across from me saying \"beyond good\". We loved it. The atmosphere is so relaxing. I can't find anything I dislike about this place. Great job guys!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite.  I must say It's kind of hard to find a real Shawarma joint that serves all the fix-ins, lately I'm finding so many places just opt for simple lettuce, tomatoes and sauce which takes away from all the exciting tantilizing and interesting flavours middle eastern food has to offer.

Enter Laziza, everything is fresh, the meat is juicy and sliced to order.  The toppings/salad options are many and the portions are hefty with reasonable prices to boot.

I had the chicken shawarma as well as a chicken shawarma pate that I ended up eating at home.  The wrap was so juicy and delish! The plate was such a great value.  I opted out of the rice and potatoes for a plate just full of their different salads (chickpea salad, mango salad, greek salad, taboule, cucumbers...the list goes on!)  Juicy freshly cooked chicken on a bed of fresh, crisp veggies topped with hummus and sauce, what more can a girl ask for?  The varierty and quality of the salads that they offered were great specially for the price."}
{"text":"Overpriced and inauthentic. Beets from the Beet Salad were from a can. The falafel tasted like it was from a mix and also very salty. The Diwali had undercooked rice and grape leaves. The baba had many huge chunks of eggplant still in it  I live in the Kent area and wanted good Mediterranean, so next time I'll take the trip to Shwarma Bros. in Cuyahoga Falls. This place is all about atmosphere, with not very good food."}
{"text":"Generally, I have great experiences at this restaurant. But last night my tabouleh salad was absolutely inedible. It was grainy with sand or dirt, so someone did not wash the parsley properly. I almost broke my teeth on the grit and pebbles! So my rating for this restaurant is just a 3. I've eaten here probably 25-30 times and although the quality is usually good, there are occasional inconsistencies like gristly chicken and tabouleh which ranges from tasty to weird or, like last night, inedible due to improper washing."}
{"text":"Great food! Even better staff! I have dined at most places in Kent and this was by far the best experience. And the food is very authentic! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Not my favorite Lebanese restaurant. Aladdin's Eatery in Hudson is so very much better. Don't waste your time or money at this restaurant."}
{"text":"There is a really stingy, grumpy man who works here.

I used to go here for lunch regularly mainly to save time because the location is close to where I work. However, there's this one grumpy man who sometimes works at lunch who always dampens one's day. 

I ordered shawarma to go today but they didn't have plastic bags so I took some extra napkins to hold the shawarma because the grease was seeping through the paper. The grumpy guy saw and said \"you can't take that many napkins!\" and tried to grab them out of my hand! I spend $40-$50 here per week and I couldn't believe that the guy was being stingy over some napkins that cost a couple of cents! And the only reason I took extra was because they didn't have any plastic bags!

Anyways, the grumpy guy can keep his couple of cents napkins savings because I'm taking the couple hundred dollars I spend on lunches annually to one of the many nearby places from now on :)

Also, unlike other places, the \"specials\" they have are all smaller in size than the regular so you're just paying less for a smaller portion and not actually getting a deal."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in there the night of Kent's Potterfest. You could see they had really been through the ringer, but that still didn't deter the wait staff and hostess/bartender. She was wonderful and got us our Dementor's Kiss drinks. They were delicious! We ended up ordering an appetizer of Hummus with Chicken Shawarma.  VERY GOOD! They smiled through it all. In fact, they literally ran out of food after we got our app.  

I will surely go back as they had dealt with a very busy and stressful night and smilled and welcomed us through it all."}
{"text":"Come here for Martini Mondays!
Drinks are fantastic and Kyle and Meg are some of the best in the business.

Food is fresh and delicious and portion sizes are more than ample."}
{"text":"Able to get a table for 4 on short notice on a busy Friday night in Kent! Staff and owner very friendly and food was very good. A little pricey, but def stop and give it a try."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE 5/5
Laziza has a very nice, classy, and almost formal atmosphere. Not a place you need to wear a tie or anything like that, but surely not a place you wear sweatpants and a tank top. The decor is tasteful and, when I ate there yesterday, I remarked that I liked the colors and the ceiling, especially. They have two floors and an outside. Really, no complaints. I give 4/5 because it was really nice, but didn't wow me or anything.

SERVICE 5/5
I've been to Laziza twice. Once in summer (like, 7 months ago) and yesterday (which is January). I can't remember my service from the first time, but the waitress I had yesterday was very nice and friendly. She was knowledgeable about the menu items and was accommodating when my girlfriend asked to switch something on her dish. The waitress was very attentive without overdoing it. Really liked the service.

TASTE 4/5
Let me say that I am no expert on Mediterranean food. Also, let me say that I do not care for Mediterranean food. But, my girlfriend does, so we go sometimes. And let me tell you, each of the two times I've gone there, I've ordered pretty Americanized food. The first time, I got a fried cod sandwich with Laziza sauce on it. Laziza sauce is orange and made out of... I have no idea. Surely, more sophisticated palates can tell, but I cannot. The cod sandwich was a special and not on the regular menu. It was FANTASTIC. If they had it on the menu, I would go there much more often. Huge sandwich with a side of fries. My girlfriend got some wrap and salad. I did not try either, but she was very pleased. 

Yesterday, I got the Laziza burger (I know, I know...) and my girlfriend got Ghallaya with a side of hummus (side of hummus was not on the menu, but they provided it to her free of charge, which I thought was very nice of them). My burger was not very good. It was too salty and the Laziza sauce was piled on it and it was overwhelming (which was not the case on my fish sandwich). I had fries as a side. Funny thing about their fries: they have tasty seasoning and they crisp on the outside while being soft (but not mushy) on the inside, but they have a notable oil taste to them. I really like their fries, but the oil taste is distracting. My gf was pleased with her dish. I had a bite and it did taste better than mine. I guess I shouldn't order a burger at a Mediterranean restaurant. Makes sense.

PRICING 4/5
There is a wide variety of prices at Laziza. Sandwiches are like $7-11 or something. Entrees are about $15 or so. Steaks are in the low to mid $20s and seafood dishes are around $30. Also, they have specials which are nice. Yesterday, they had $12 for a bottle of house wine (did not get it, so I can't speak to the quality) and 1/2 off appetizers. Beer prices are decent for the type of restaurant - cost me $3.25 for a domestic bottle. For the price and quality from my experience, I'd say it's cheaper than what I would expect to pay.

OVERALL 4/5
Laziza is a classy, yet casual, restaurant with very reasonable prices and pretty good food and great service. I am personally not a huge fan, but I do not much care for Mediterranean food, so I am trying not to let that impact my ratings. My girlfriend, who does like Mediterranean food, does like the restaurant a lot, so I'm factoring that into my rating. I like that they have daily specials as well. If you like Mediterranean and are in Kent, it's probably worth checking out."}
{"text":"Laziza's was suggested by a friend who resides in Kent, and I'm so glad she took me here. The atmosphere is stylish and relaxing. We had a window seat with a view to the completely revitalized part of town. I remember Kent from my college years in the 80s, when it was not at all this beautiful. Our server was busy with a considerable lunch crowd, yet he was attentive and friendly. By the time we finished our meal, the restaurant was packed. The best part was the food itself. I've visited many Mediterranean restaurants, but the food here was superior. The food alone deserves a 5 star rating. Generous portions, and delicious! I enjoy the meat varieties, especially their lamb and chicken are wonderful. I recommend the variety platter served with rice and veggies. Prepare to take some food home, because the portions are definitely too much for some people. The men's room reminded me of  a country club, elegant and spacious. Perhaps the server was overwhelmed with the sudden appearance of so many guests. At least one additional server would have lightened his load. We arrived before noon, so the fact that the restaurant filled up so early may have been unexpected."}
{"text":"Its an amazing place with excellent choices of Mediterranean food. It sure exceeded my expectations.  The atmosphere is very nice and everyone is very nice. Enjoyed the wine selections. Will give a A + for food and wines and the atmosphere.  Special thanks to Taylor for making it an enjoyable experience and an A++ to her. Will highly recommend this place. 
Thx

{"text":"Awesome drinks, awesome food. Love that they have low carb options and a large variety"}
{"text":"Clean,spacious, beautiful, fantastic food! We found all the ingredients to be fresh! Ordered the Veal and Ohio city pasta and Kafta Kabobs w/ rice. The arugula sale was fantastic and the deserts were home made! First time but not the last!"}
{"text":"We had a couple minutes before a lengthy show, so we stopped at Laziza for some Middle Eastern quick eats. Laziza is a small restaurant with minimal seating. The idea is mostly takeout, for pre-made or ready-to-cook dishes that are displayed Subway-style on the counter.

I recently developed a love affair with falafel, so I treated myself to their falafel plate. They fill a styrofoam container to the brim with a variety of good stuff including: falafel, chick peas, fried rice, fried eggplant, fried cauliflower, and what I'll call a zesty salad for lack of a better name. So let's break it down. Obviously most of the plate didn't taste exceptionally fresh since it's not made-to-order, but it was plenty good with that in mind, and everything held up well. The fried eggplant and cauliflower were light, yet savoury. The fried rice was sufficiently seasoned and solidly average. Without question though, the highlights of the plate were the falafel (duh...) and surprisingly the salad! Please forgive me for not recalling the exact ingredients in the salad, but some notables included romaine lettuce, red cabbage, and bean sprouts. In any case, it was delightfully zesty, with inviting sweetness. Lastly, the falafel. I've had a fair bit of falafel in my life, and I can honestly say that this one was pretty unique. Once you bite through the super crispy outer shell you're exposed to a soft and unexpectedly bright green inner patty. The shell has a bit of a bold flavour, reminiscent to a samosa, while the inside greets you with a tangy twist on your generic falafel. If I had to pick between the standard falafel and this for the rest of my life, I'd go with the standard, but Laziza's variation is a welcome interpretation.

In conclusion, you'll get good fast food quality Middle Eastern food at Laziza. 
Seal of quick eats approval!"}
{"text":"It's important to realize in this review, that we are vegetarians. But we were very disappointed by everything we ordered. The spinach and cheese pies appetizers were doughy and bland. The side salad was a typical American lettuce and tomatoes with a boring vinaigrette. I ordered the vegetarian mixed appetizer plate as a main dish and the only flavorful part was the baba. The humous was tasteless, the dawali were dry and hard, and the tabouli was all parsley. The pita that came with it was also hard and cold and tasted stale. My husband ordered a vegetables with lentils and rice dish that was plentiful but tasteless. He left  most of it. We've also never been at a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurant that served rolls and butter, and even the rolls were bland. We've eaten at many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean restaurants all over the country and have never had such boring food. We definitely do not recommend this restaurant for vegetarians."}
{"text":"I eat here 4 or 5 times a week. Fast, affordable, healthy and super tasty. Friendly service - and super large portions. Very clean.

The baklava and garlic sauce are the best I've had, anywhere."}
{"text":"The menu was huge and there are a lot of good things to try. It's pretty Americanized if people are worried they aren't going to find ANYTHING they want."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and what a beautiful restaurant. We just moved to Hudson and came down to visit Kent. This restaurant has Great ambiance, beautifully decorated and our food and service were excellent. Mike was our server who gave us a great explanation of the history of the restaurant and the ownership. It was great to hear as the charm of a non franchise restaurant should always be about the strength of their  people and the quality of the their food. 

I would recommend this place to my friends and family. And I look forward to our return."}
{"text":"The first time I came here it was like at 8:00 for a friends birthday and nobody was in the restaurant. Thought this was odd because google said the place didn't close till 10. We came in feeling awkward and weird. Didn't really feel welcome and almost left but then we got a cool waiter. Alright food. Haven't been back in months so what does that tell you."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio looking down at new kent on Erie st. The gyro special was pretty lackluster.The gf liked the vegi grape leaves.
Very large restaurant with a lot of wood. Very attractive with a fair beer selection. Good service, but average food."}
{"text":"Kent is getting pretty sweet now. If you were here even a year ago, you wouldn't recognize the place. It's so much different from when I was going to school there 12 years ago. 

Things are popping up in the brand spankin' new Acorn Alley that they're still in the process of building. Laziza is one of those new businesses and it's pretty darn awesome. If you're familiar with the Continental Grill, just across from the KSU campus, you'll know the food -- they're the same owners. Laziza is much less casual and, in fact, decorated gorgeously. 

My family and I had a reservation this past Saturday, on a very busy commencement day at KSU, to celebrate my brother's graduation. Naturally, many other families with graduates had opted to do the same. They were pretty packed but you would never be able to tell by the service. It was top notch. We had GREAT service and they were absolutely slammed with at least ten other large parties. Our server was excellent and very knowledgeable. One of the owners stopped by our table twice to check on us. That's always a nice touch at any restaurant. 

Everyone in our party enjoyed their food. It was delicious. I'll be honest, I was not expecting it to be as good as it was because \"Mediterranean\" is such a broad term when speaking of food. But seriously, this place had the best baba ghanoush I've ever had. We tried a LOT of different things: hummus, falafel, dawali, tabbouleh, fried kibbeh, several different rice dishes (makhuba, shish kebob, shwarma) and the Lebanese salad. 

Quite honestly, it all exceeded my expectations. I hope to visit Laziza again sometime  when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior, and the owner is extremely nice and welcoming. I enjoyed the presentation of the dishes, and the freshness of the falafel. My salmon salad was good, but a salad is a salad. I tried my cousins lamb on humus and it was super amazing. I ordered a martini that was weak. The service was great. I'll go back, and not order drinks."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food is delicious, especially the basmati rice.  I usually get the Laziza platter or a fillet and my wife gets the chicken.  The owner Mike is usually there to greet people and talk with the customers.  We've never had a bad meal there and highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"The portions are pretty big so be prepared! The food tasted delicious and the atmosphere was pretty calm. My mom, brother, and some friends went over for (my) first time after Match Day from NEOMED in Rootstown. 

I thought the restaurant was actually pretty small but the upper floor is long and it seems would be perfect for a large private party or private functions. 

The vegetable couscous was alright but the Spanish paella was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite places in Kent. The food is amazing every time and the staff is always kind and attentive. I've been on numerous occasions (5+) and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I can't believe we stumbled onto this great restaurant in downtown Kent Ohio! We came to town to enjoy a concert at Kent Stage ( an old theater getting restored) and viewed the menu prior to dinner. It looked great, but was better than expected! 
Good service, and great food, plus generous drinks at reasonable prices. The only thing lacking - the restaurant is a little noisy when busy. 
BTW - try the paella. The right mix of rice, spices and seafood! Excellent!
 
Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"My dreams came true when Laziza first opened up when I was still living in Kent. My girlfriends and I were frequent visitors and literally came here once a week to gossip and eat their yummy Mediterranean cuisine. They also have a bunch of other options aside from Mediterranean, but I rarely ever go with anything besides the hummus with chicken entree. All entrees come with either a soup or salad, which is nice because a lot of restaurants charge extra if you want either before the actual meal. The chicken was always cooked to perfection and flavored with the perfect amount of spices. Add that to the rice and delicious hummus + veggies and you have yourself one good finger licking meal. 

Since moving to Cleveland and going back to Kent on occasion, I always make a point to return to my old watering hole and place my usual order. Management is always on point, service is good, but this past visit, I noticed my entree was not out of this world like I had remembered (granted it was homecoming weekend and they were super busy) Nonetheless, it was still a great dining experience and I can't wait to go back for the food and for the nostalgia of being a care free college student :)"}
{"text":"Great, flavourful falafel wrap. Excellent service and good value. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant and are regular visitors.  At one point or another we have eaten through most of this menu and have never had a bad meal.  Great service in a friendly atmosphere and I highly recommend this eatery."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. The food is so flavorful and delicious! I had a Pretty in Pink martini that was very well made. Great service. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff... Very filling! The price is a bit high for the protein entrees, but the atmosphere is fantastic. Clean. I'd be back if I lived closer. I got the lava cake and it was amazing!!!!!! The vegetarian appetizer was huge and great for sharing."}
{"text":"Great looking place. Pity about the food. They serve stone cold rice and chicken a real health risk. Wont be long before this place gets shut down."}
{"text":"A coworker picked this place for a business dinner that I was apart of and I was surprised at how big this restaurant was--it's actually on two levels. Our waitress was friendly and attentive to our needs throughout our meal. Our table shared the sampler and some hummus for appetizers. I only ate the hummus as that's my favorite and it was pretty good. I would have liked more pita bread with my meal rather than the other kind they had in the bread basket, which was shaped like pita but thicker. For my main entree, I went with the chicken and hummus which came with rice. The chicken was very flavorful and it say on top of the same hummus I had earlier for my appetizer. Portion sizes were large and I couldn't finish it all and by this point, I started to have enough of the hummus. For dessert, I went with one of their specials for the week, which was tiramisu. In the end, I wish I had passed as it wasn't that great and not worth the calories in my opinion. I thought the tiramisu was dry."}
{"text":"I visited Laziza for a business lunch on Mon. when I was in town visiting KSU.  My host suggested it and comped the lunch, so unlike most eateries I end up at, it wasn't by my own choice and dime.  However, it was a good choice on my host's part, given that the atmosphere and service were pleasant and the food was good and reasonably priced.

Per my host's suggestion, I ordered the Caesar salad in a crispy pita shell ($7.99).  Despite the name, this isn't a traditional Caesar salad.  In addition to chopped romaine lettuce and Caesar dressing, it includes diced tomatoes and cucumbers, red onions, black olives, and feta cheese.  It was quite flavorful, though I wish it had been a bit more heavily dressed.  In particular, I enjoyed the crispy pita shell, which added a nice crunchy texture to the salad.

Because this was a business lunch, I wasn't able to sample any of the other orders, but they included another Caesar salad, an arugula salad, and a pita sandwich of some kind.  All of my colleagues seemed to enjoy their orders.  Our waitress mentioned that the Caesar salad will soon be changed to a more traditional version, but it will still include the crispy pita shell.

Overall, I enjoyed my lunch at Laziza.  As this was my first visit to Kent, I don't know what other eateries are in town, but it seems like a solid choice for a nicer meal."}
{"text":"Dining here was disappointing to say the least.  Some entrees were bland and the burger that one in our party had was salty beyond being able to eat. One entree had a whole bay leaf and a whole cinnamon stick that has not been removed before serving.  Table service was OK but not outstanding. After providing feedback about the entrees, management did comp several of the entrees and provided some complimentary deserts.  Too many good options in Acorn alley to choose from to want to try this again.  Maybe in time we will try again in hopes that our experience was just a bad night in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Fabulous ambiance with delicious food and attentive servers. Great place to meet friends or celebrate any event!"}
{"text":"Smart & swanky place over two floors.  Two of us were seated upstairs  in area of mostly larger tables for families.  Split an appetizer of mussels, and said they were the best she's ever had (and she's been to Bertha's in Baltimore a few times).  
Otherwise good but nothing exceptional.  Lamb wasn't particularly well seasoned.  Salads were large.  Service on the slower side, but atmosphere made up for it.
In all, better restaurants of this type, but not in a college town."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go in Kent. The service staff is awesome, the food is great, and Martini Monday is an experience everyone should have! Here right now having the best martini of my life that's not even on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim with two girlfriends for lunch and I will have to say that I'm very impressed.  The interior is beautiful.  Our waiter was very helpful ( answered questions, refilled drinks, and also friendly).  I ordered the chicken shawarma with a side vegetable salad.  It was delicious and the salad was a healthy alternative to the fries ( I tried a fry and it was fabulous).  I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu.  Love that there is a classy restaurant option in Kent!"}
{"text":"There are quite a number of shops and restaurants moving into downtown Kent and as a resident I am extremely happy with all of the new businesses! 
Laziza's is one of these new restaurant in the newly built Acorn Alley II in Kent, Ohio. 
I had dinner with a few friends this Friday. The atmosphere and food were both great! We got to the restaurant a little after 5pm and were able to get a table in the lower level dining room right away. Both owners (Michael and Nicole Awad) came to the table at different times to ask how things were going - very nice people. I ordered the Falafel wrap which came with a Lebanese salad. The falafel were flavorful and fluffy, fried just right. The seasonings were great - lots of fresh parsley and creamy tahini sauce. The Lebanese salad had large chunks of tomato, cucumber, green pepper, and red onion with a great dressing. I ordered a falafel wrap and chicken shawarma wrap to go. Even the next day both wraps were delicious right from the fridge. 
I will be a regular at Laziza's for dining in and take-out! Thank you to the Awad's for choosing Kent to start their restaurant!
Definitely a recommended place to eat!

Side note: since the building they're in is so new, it's not yet really marked on any online maps. The address I gave is close and will get you to the right spot, but it may not be the official address. Also, their website is still under a bit of construction so you can view the menu and see pictures on the Kent Patch article about the opening: http://kent.patch.com/articles/hot-spot-laziza-still-awaiting-phone-internet-hookups#c"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner and we enjoyed it. We walked in and they weren't super busy, but it is the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. We waited awhile before a hostess came-we saw them talking in the back. When she did come she was friendly though. We started with the brie appetizer and it was awesome. Then we got the two house salads that came with our meals. Nice size, and we tried their mustard vinaigrette, it was ok not great. The bread and oil they served was very good. My husband got the lobster linguine. It came with fresh spinach on top, and a ton of lobster. We both really enjoyed it. I got the seafood paella. Tons of seafood in it which was great. It was a tab bit dry, but the server recommended the aziza sauce, which was really good and took the dish to the next level. It was a really diverse menu which we enjoyed, and all in all a good experience. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere.  Excellent service.  Salad that came with entree was not up to par: too much, but mostly just chopped/torn lettuce; nice house dressing though.  Excellent menu diversity, but again; execution lagged.  Hummus with Lamb was very good, but lamb was a little over-done.  Lebanese wine offering was a rare treat, and was very good.  Actual rating is 3.5, and I'd go back.  I'd say give it a try."}
{"text":"Healthy late night eats in a neighborhood that could use a few more of 'em. Fast and friendly service. Very inexpensive. Come here after a night at Comedy Bar."}
{"text":"Evening started with a warm welcome from the owner, Mike Awad, and progressed with great food and service!  Be sure to get the hummus and tabouli!"}
{"text":"I'm always ready to try new Shawarma places and when a co-worker suggested we try Laziza I jumped at the chance. 

First plus is that Laziza is a few steps from Delaware Exit at Ossington Station.  This makes it a great location for lunch if your on the BD line. 

We stopped in right as they were opening and the amazing smell of fresh Chicken and Beef Shawarma instantly got my taste buds in action! There was huge piles of toppings and plenty of sides if you went the platter route. 

I decided on the mixed (chicken & beef) platter. It was huge. I think he put on every side and topping that was available. It came with Lentil rice, potatoes, roasted cauliflower, salad, coleslaw, pickles, feta, tahini, garlic paste, hummus, and some hot sauce. Don't forget about the huge pile of meat on top of all that. My takeout container barely closed!  

The salads are super fresh and the Lentil Rice was fantastic. Everything was great! The chicken was seasoned perfectly and was very tender. The Beef was also great. I was lucky and was able to get the first cuts so it was tender crispy and a little salty all at the same time! It was a huge portion for lunch so I had to skip dinner! I was extremely full!

I have been back a few times since my first experience  and I've had the Shawarma wraps. They are also huge for about $8!  They also have two for one specials."}
{"text":"The food was awesome!   I had the surf and turf and my wife had the ribeye -- both were wonderful, and their martinis were also fantastic!

The staff there was attentive without being overly-attentive (hovering), and we were even able to enjoy the music from the bar across the street.  

An absolutely wonderful experience!  We'll definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"We have had dinner here a couple of times and it has consistently been delicious.  We went last night and didnt have a reservation so we sat at the bar and got our food and drinks super fast. Thanks to Kyle and Kyle (our very friendly bar tenders)  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We loved this place. The service, food, and ambience were great. A complete wine list with plenty of choices under $30."}
{"text":"When I'm looking for something other than the typical \"college town\" food, I love eating at Lazizas! It's in a great little corner of downtown Kent, so while you're waiting for a table you can stop in at some of the local shops to look around.

Lazizas has light and delicious Medeteranian food! When I get an appetizer, there's a great dish that has some hummus and other types of dips with pita and veggies that is out of this world! I usually get the lentil soup as my main dish, which definitely hits the spot. I know there's a bar towards the entrance, but I haven't had the chance to try any of their specialty drinks.

The only thing I dislike about this restaurant is that it's a little pricey, but you pay for quality food so I can't really complain. I went to Lazizas to celebrate my birthday last year, so that in itself shows you how much I would recommend this place. Gotta love Lazizas!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and am always impressed by the food. Service has been a bit slow but I chalk it up to new restaurant. 

The Laziza Burger is amazing. I don't know what the sauce is that they put on it but it is tasty. I will say that I am picky about how a burger is cooked and both times it was a perfect medium so kudos there."}
{"text":"The bread served before dinner melted in my mouth! I had the fool and the Mediterranean salad.--both incredible! It's hard to get good fool and they do it perfectly here!  The waitstaff were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is a dump. We waited 2 hours and a half hours for our food it was cold, flavorless, and expensive. I ordered a drink and they literally brought it to me with half an olive that looked eaten. Save your money and got to Aladdin's Eatery instead."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful place for dinner.  Very attentive staff, and a fantastic vegetarian sampler and laziza wrap (grilled to perfection).  I can't think of a negative thing to say!"}
{"text":"The kibbie was great. The shawarma was pretty light on the meat but tasted great. I didn't care for their version of hummus, but my buddy's girlfriend thought it was great.

A touch pricey, and you might want to make sure you have some finer duds on. But I am going back."}
{"text":"Took myself here for lunch on a weekday, I was dressed pretty scrubby but the staff kindly pretended I was a normal, unscrubby type of person.

I had the kibbie, which was a little bland for my tastes, but not at all bad! Just not for me. I did really enjoy the yogurt they served with them. The hummos was good, and served with chickpeas on top like I remember as a kid. The star of my meal was the appetizer of crab cakes I ordered, which I ate like a starving pig at a trough. They were so good! 

Service was really great, the girl that helped me was really nice, and the other various staff there were super amicable as well. I'd love to head back soon to try other stuff on the menu, as well as shove more crab cakes down my gullet in a Pac-Man type fashion."}
{"text":"This place seems newish and is conveniently located between my gym and the subway station (near Ossington) so I've been picking up delicious Mediterranean food on my way home.

The food here is super fresh and the owners/employees really take pride in serving you, lots of friendly smiles and suggestions. I've tried the chicken plate to go, they grill the chicken while you wait, and load the container up with basically whatever you want. Their roast potatoes are amazing as were the grilled cauliflower and eggplant, and the salads are all fresh. I tried a sample of nearly everything. 

They have some really good deals (2 chicken shawarma sandwiches for $7.99) so if you're dining for 2 or ridiculously hungry, you can get a really good deal here. 

Overall was impressed with the freshness of the food and the super friendly employees."}
{"text":"We went here thinking it was going to be great since we heard good things about it. We sat down and asked our server what beers where on draft, she opened the bar menu and said its lisedt but under draft it says ask your server. She said um I don't know. She had no clue. The server was we slow it took about 20 mins to get my martini from the bar. Then for my husbands beer his second one she totally forgot about it. We ordered the lamp kabobs and chicken kabobs. They were just ok nothing really to special about it. My chicken was super dry so I asked my server to bring me some dipping sauce with, once she finally got it to me I was almost done with my food. The best part of the meal was the rice. We both thought it was lacking flavor. The salad was super small a plate with 3 little tomato piece and a couple raw onions. We also got rolls but no butter. For the price there are way way better places to go."}
{"text":"First visit. Gorgeous interior. Very friendly staff.  Food was delicious! I had the beet salad with beef and my friend had a Mediterranean salad with salmon.  The only areas of opportunities are their timeliness.   Slow to follow up; I had told our server that I was definitely having desert, yet it took quite awhile for the server to bring the desert tray--we were going to a concert at Kent Stage, so I didn't have time to wait for a molten lava or creme brûlée.  I made my selection, and it took the server a good 10 minutes to tell me that my choice was no longer available.   By then it as too late to have desert.   I also was surprised that they would have been out of a desert at 7:00pm on a Saturday!   
I would most certainly go back--when I have more than 90 minutes to enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"They're far from providing the original Arabian taste. But the service is just amazing. They make sure you leave happy."}
{"text":"I loved coming here when I went to Kent State, and it was a monthly treat due to price. I had the chance to go back yesterday while visiting, and it lived up to every memory I had of it.

I ordered the vegetarian sampler with extra bread and falafel instead of tabbouleh. It was absolutely delicious. The hummus and baba ghanoush were a tad acidic for my taste, but still good. The falafel is TO DIE FOR. The French fries are heavenly. I have dreams about these fries. Service was also fantastic, our server was on the spot with suggestions and recommendations, and very friendly.

My husband ordered the lamb over hummus. He says of the experience: \"The food was fantastic. I got the lamb shawarma over hummus with squash and zucchini, and the food was incredible. The drinks were cheap on special, and very very very strong. The fries were amazing, and the Laziza sauce is really good. And the server was super nice and helpful.\""}
{"text":"Hands down the best shawarma I have ever eaten! Brownie points for making me a fish wrap when it wasn't on the menu. Advised me to not add too much spice or sauce and it was perfect! I'm gonna dream of and crave this sandwich, and I'm not even a fan of Middle-Eastern food! Very friendly staff. My husband had the chicken shawarma and he loves this type of food...he too said, \"Best shawarma!\""}
{"text":"This review is based upon two visits for lunch.  

The menu is varied and the quality seems good. Very tasty.    

Overall ...
  Service:  4.5
  Interior/decor:  4
  Price/value:  3.5
  Food quality:  4

WI-fi:  Nope!  (There was encrypted wi-fi with LAZIZA as the SSID, but the waitress said we could not use it.)  I oughtta \"ding\" them for that!

For folks wanting a bit lower price point -- check out the little place on East Main St (used to be Palcho's Donut Shop in the \"olden days\").  Same owner; same tasty food; less formal; lower price.  (Side note:  We like Laziza better than Continental Cuisine in Akron, FWIW.)"}
{"text":"My family and I had a great meal!  The food is delicious and they have an extensive drink selection.  Fahad was an incredible server- very attentive and helpful!"}
{"text":"Decent food and service, however the chicken shawarma is always gristly ( sometimes so much so that I feel like I might chip a tooth). I"}
{"text":"A very respectable lunch spot in Kent, providing healthy and substantive options.  The salads are huge enough that you can take a second portion home for another meal.  People are constantly pitting Laziza against Aladdin's, and in the hummus category, Laziza totally wins with its creamy, well-seasoned deliciousness, including a few whole chickpeas and pickled radishes for garnish.  I could eat it by the kilo!"}
