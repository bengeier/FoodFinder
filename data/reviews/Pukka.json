{"text":"The mushroom stuffed paneer was amazing! I melted a little inside after each bite. Presentation and service was superb, the owner even came by to ask us how everything was going and took the time to chat with us, it was pretty awesome. Getting 3 courses non-prix fixe was a bit pricey, but the mushroom paneer is worth the visit at least once a month."}
{"text":"Consistent food is the most important thing for people who loves to eat. Pukka's menu makes you feel like coming back for more. Fresh and unfrozen all the time. Let the Indian taste take control of you pallet."}
{"text":"Wow! Had to write a review about the awesome flavours at this place. Well balanced dishes that each had their own distinct and delicious taste. Until Nov. 30th the have a coupon for $20 off your meal available in the restaurant! Will be back even at full price."}
{"text":"Chicken 65, lassi, eggplant tartare, lamb lollipop and Punjabi chicken were very good - the chicken and lamb were cooked to perfection, not over cooked but just right. The chai is just plain tea - you can hardly taste the spices. The staff were great, as was the atmosphere. Overall would come here again especially to get the Eton mess - what a lovely light dessert to finish off your meal."}
{"text":"Pukka touts a pretty impressive international selection of wines, hand selected by Scaramouche's sommelier, Peter Boyd. At our tasting, Peter explained to us that pairing wine with spicy Indian food can be a challenge at times as the big, bold higher alcohol offerings wont work with certain levels of heat.  He therefore has very meticulously put together a list of about 12 International wines by the glass, and a total of about 25 wines available by the bottle that he felt would best balance the complex flavours on the plate. 
Over the course of the evening we sampled a nice spread of the restaurant's offerings beginning with a few cocktails and transitioning quickly to two different wines to pair with our appetizers and mains respectively. Take a peak at what we tried:

Welcome Cocktail: Pomegranate Royale 

Indian Caesar

Addictively good- I loved the addition of ginger and curry spices for the kick

2012 Pinot Bianco, Nals Margreid Italy ($46/bottle)

2012 Cotes du Rhone, St. Michel France ($9.30/glass, $45/bottle)

Cold Tandoori Smoked Eggplant Tartare - Khasta Roti ($7.90)

Vegetarians rejoice- this tartare was fabulously meaty in texture and flavour.

Mixed Vegetable Pakoras - Tomato Chutney ($7.80)

Super crispy and addictive, I loved the generous dusting of aromatic spices.

Vegetable String Chaat- Puffed Rice, Sprouts, Chutneys, Sweet Yoghurt ($8.70)

Refreshing and light.

Baby Kale Salad - Dates, Lotus Chips, Spiced Cashew Dressing ($8.40)

One of my favourites of the night (and I am admittedly not one of those crazy kale lovers). The combination of salty nutty dressing with the sweet dates and the crispy chips really made that otherwise tough green shine. 

Chicken 65 - South Indian Fried Chicken, Chili Tamarind Sauce ($9.40)

Loved the sweet and mildly spicy sauce.

Goat Cheese Stuffed Lamb Kebabs - Pomegranate Reduction ($10.20)

The lamb was incredibly juicy, while the tanginess of the herbed goats cheese was perfectly balanced by the sweet pomegranate sauce.

Poppadoms and Chutney ($2.90)

Like the lightest, crispiest chips ever.

Spinach and Mushroom Stuffed Paneer - Pistachio Korma Sauce ($16.40)

While I'm usually not a crazy paneer lover, I liked the addition of meaty mushrooms to beef it up.

Pan-Seared Pickerel - Coconut and Curry Leaf ($19.80)

A fabulous coconut curry sauce that demanded to be sopped up by extra naan.

Butter Chicken - Tomato Infused Butter Sauce ($18.40)

The hands down favourite dish at the table. Succulent juicy chicken in a lusciously creamy sauce. I think we were all fighting over the extra sauce on the plate.

Beef Short Ribs - Braised with Black Cumin, Garlic and Ginger ($21.80)

Super tender beef in a very savoury sauce that offered a nice relief from the rest of the more creamy options.

Daal Makhani - Slow Cooked Black Lentils ($7.80)

Daal to me is comfort food, and this was truly divine.

French Beans - Caramelized Onions, Tumeric and Coconut ($8.20)

Loved the crispy coconut on the nicely al dente beans.

Naan Basket 

So many fabulous options here- my favourite being the sweet garlic naan!

Eton Mess - Rosewater Meringue, Pomegranate, Mango, Sweet Lassi Cream ($7.90)

A light dessert with a nice balance of sweet fruit, tangy yogurt and crunchy floral cookie. Yes, I inhaled this, and everyone took notice.

Pukka is now open daily for dinner at 778 St Clair West. You can book a table online (bonus!!), and I definitely suggest you do because with food and drink offerings like this, you can bet this is going to be a hot Toronto spot. Is Indian the next Toronto trend? If it all tastes like this, we can only hope!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing evening at pukka- an enjoyable intriguing three course meal. The chef had gone an extra mile for every dish. Delicately plated and mouthwatering- it was a treat for every sense. 

We opted for all the vegetarian options on the menu. The appetizers from the HarA Bhara kebab to the okra fries to the eggplant tartare were outstanding. The condiments were equally good from the apricot sauce to the mustard raita. 

The smooth paneer gravy, assorted bread basket and the cauliflower pepper fry made for a stellar main course. 
We were quite full but could not resist dessert in the form of a silky pudding and mango panacotta. It was surprisingly light and an excellent way to finish the meal. 

Well worth the money! Very playful take on Indian food"}
{"text":"Pukka is arguably the best modern Indian food restaurant in Toronto. The menu is quite creative, think okra fries, absolutely delicious! The drinks menu is amazing, nice choice of deserts and excellent service. We were there on a busy Saturday night and the dishes were served literally 20 min after ordering, unbelievable. The other thing that was quite impressive, I had a little accident and picked up someone else's jacket on my way out (it looked almost identical), and the owner came by my house and brought my jacket within minutes of our phone conversation. That's what I call an excellent costumer service. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who appreciates Indian food, it is sub par."}
{"text":"Our group of 4 was really excited to try this highly rated resto....and while some of my dining partners would have liked to give this place a 4, I feel 3 is fair all things considered.  It was a pleasant enough meal but there was nothing in it to surprise or impress me.  Every thing was OK to good.  A number of dishes were \"too saucy\" according to the vegetarian in our group and just about everything we tried was \"too rich\", to quote our resident carnivore. Over an hour after we finished our meal, hubby and I were still feeling very bloated. 

We did try a lot of the dishes: String chat - meh - \"too saucy\"; Chicken 65 - nice spicing but a bit too salty and way too fatty; South Indian Vegetable curry - pretty good; Butter chicken - nice but a bit too rich and too sweet; Punjabi chicken curry - good; Beef vindaloo - interesting take on the dish, sauce too rich and again too sweet; French beans were quite nice; plain naan was good (but lots of places make good naan). We had lattes and cappuccino at the end- the lattes were weak but the cap was \"really good\" according to hubby. The chocolate torte at the end got mixed reviews - hubby and I thought it was \"just OK\" but our friends raved about it!

Service was excellent; decor and vibe were really terrific.  Acoustics were a bit problematic - we had to lean in quite closely to hear one another.  So yeah, it was a pleasant evening out with friends."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourites. Consistently delicious. It's hard to get through on the phone to make resos, but they took us 4 as a walk in at 6:30pm on a Friday. Ordered the calamari and chaat to start and the lamb and boathouse fish/ prawn curry along with garlic naan and a fragrant rice. If I could give it a 6 I would :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.

Really great choice of Indian influenced cocktails. The appetizer portions are big and justify the prize... So do the main courses.

The service is simply perfect. The waitress also gave great advice on the food.

Wine menu... Different and great.

Really recommend this place... Indian food canadianized with a Twist"}
{"text":"I've been to Pukka about 3 times now and it's consistently good! I especially liked the spinach and mushroom stuffed paneer and butter chicken. Perfect for neighbourhood dinners!"}
{"text":"We regularly eat Indian food, whether it's at a cheap street eats place in Little India, or one of our favourite mid-range choices. So we were looking forward to trying Pukka. 
This was my choice for my birthday, and it didn't disappoint. 
Definitely advise making a reservation, or if you're lucky they may squeeze you in at the bar. 
We started with the vegetable pakoras with a tomato chutney - crispy and flavourful. 
We shared the European sea bass in a delicious coconut curry, daal makhani and bhindi bhaji tossed with garlic and ginger, with some basmati rice and a chutney plate. All delicious. Some Indian restaurants will miss delivering because all their dishes taste the same, not so for Pukka - everything was a new experience in spices and flavour. The one note is the spice level is very mild, including the \"spicy pickle plate\". 
For dessert we had the sweet plate to share which includes 2 of 3 different mini desserts, these change periodically. We had marshmallows with sugared garam masala, spiced rice pudding squares, and a cardamom cashew cookie. Paired it with a Chocolate Chai, nicely spiced and not too sweet."}
{"text":"4/5!! I am usually not a huge fan of Indian restaurants but this place is fantastic! We went for summerlicious (group of 7) and we all enjoyed every part of our meal. The Kale Salad, Chicken 65 and Smoked Eggplant Tartare were all amazing starters. As for the main, my favourite was the Pan-Roasted Pickerel in tomato-fennel broth. The Beef Short Ribs braised with black cumin, garlic and ginger as a close second. I'm not a fan of butter chicken but for those that are this is one of the best places to go for it. 

The following negatives prevented it from getting 5 stars: the A/C wasn't turned on, not kid-friendly and the dessert was average. I was not impressed with Marinated Fruit with sweet lassi cream and the Chocolate Espresso Cake was dry."}
{"text":"I love Indian food and I have had a lot of it in different places in the world. I can say that the Punjab chicken curry was an absolute delight. The chicken was tender with a delicious balance of herbs with a modest heat allowing the taste shine though.  The service was flawless as the staff was both attentive and very professional without any pretence. All together a brilliant meal. I have found a new favourite and will keep coming back eager for more"}
{"text":"I've brought family members and good friends here and had great experiences. Most recently we spent my birthday at Pukka and it was delicious and wonderful."}
{"text":"All the wonderful flavours of India with excellent ingredients and a modern twist. One of my favourite little restaurants in the city. Period."}
{"text":"Finally, an Indian restaurant in Toronto that not only serves up great food, but has a wine list that will impress most aficionados.

Standout dishes:

They served up the best baby kale salad I've ever had! The spiced cashew dressing was unbelievably creamy (like a creaser) without any of the dairy. And the dates and lotus chips added great flavour and texture to the dish.

The pan-seared pickerel was flaky, buttery and spiced perfectly. The coconut and curry leaf sauce was beautifully balanced and complemented the fish.

Eton Mess dessert. I usually find Indian desserts too sweet for my palate, but this dish was perfectly balanced: the chewiness of the meringue, the sweetness of the mango, acidity of the pomegranate and creaminess of the sweet lassi came together in this delightful and refreshing dessert."}
{"text":"Dinner was above average as expected for the price but not exceptional.

We had the following for two people:
Chicken 65 as an appetizer-  Good amount of taste but chicken could have been more tender.
Lamb lollipops- Tender and sauce was creamy
Beef short ribs-  Recommended, beef was super tender and sauce had a good amount of spice and was great for naan and rice.
Wilted greens + paneer- There were chunks of cheese with some greens.  Not that tasty, not what we had expected, would not recommend.
Rice- great with curry
Galic naan- One order come with 4 pieces, it was okay.  Not enough garlic taste."}
{"text":"I really liked the environment. I went there for my last birthday along with some friends. We had never been there before but it was a new local place and I wanted to give them a try. Great place. The food was Devine. We ordered a bunch of things and shaded everything. Everything we ordered was fabulous and we ordered many items off the menu. Most of us eat vegetarian and this place did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Was there recently, just some thoughts on the place.  The best thing about it was that the atmosphere was definitely chic, and the wine list was excellent; these qualities, really set Pukka apart when compared to other Indian restaurants downtown. 
The food was just okay. Nothing exception, nothing earth shattering.  The samosas were tasty, but uninspired.  For mains we had the butter chicken and punjabi chicken.  Both of which were a little disappointing.  The flavor of both dishes was underwhelming; I'd even go as far as saying they were timid.  
The presentation was excellent, as it definitely lived up to the air of the restaurant.  This however is the main problem with the restaurant.  Far too much emphasis was placed on style and too little on substance. 

Pukka, in my opinion, is a good choice if you're looking for Indian to take your WASPy relatives or friends. However, if you really enjoy Indian, I'd recommend you give Pukka a pass. 
2/5"}
{"text":"I have been here twice since it opened. I love the goat cheese stuffed lamb kabobs, chicken 65. One thing I loved about Amaya was the daal makhani and I am so glad they have it here. Def. recommend."}
{"text":"Ate at Pukka last night and had a wonderful meal. The staff was very attentive and friendly. There were only two of us so I found the price per dish quite high. The sizes are for sharing, four people minimum would be better and bring the pricing more in line.but for two it limits your selection."}
{"text":"I should frame this visit around the fact that, unbeknownst to me nor my colleagues, it was the first evening of Winterlicious. Filled with enough diners rapacious for a deal that tap water was omnipresent and wine, cocktails, and any and all other beverages were confined to, well, behind the bar and a scatter of first date tables.

In spite of the largely \"cost efficient\" atmosphere, the food struck a balance between the vibrance that is the be-all and end-all of Indian cuisine and the refinement of fine Western dining. 

At its worst, it erred on the side of a misery-inducing safety. An eggplant tartare craved smoke (and spice). The roti chips that accompanied the dish felt as if they were of the store bought variety if there was ever such a thing as store bought variety roti chips. 

The butter chicken, on the other hand, was a polyamorous relationship of cream, tang, and spice. The short ribs offer a similar (delicious) confrontation of flavour. 

Plating reflected the of-the-now mentality of the restaurant with metals tins and mason jars serving as trendy reminders as to why the bill you'll be paying very shortly is exactly what it is.

Excellent wine menu with a number of cleverly compiled red wine offerings. A few reds may skew a tad overpowering for the cuisine at hand, but the extent and accessibility of the offerings ought to be commended.

Service, like the food when best executed, is a lovely balance of homely comfort and elegant, upscale distance."}
{"text":"This was an absolute culinary treat. A mist have are the lamb lollipops and pumpkin curry. The malai tikka and pukka chaat were also fantastic. The owner here (Harsh) is a fabulous host and the service is wonderful. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and service. Loved the curry pumpkin!!!! Highly recommend it!! A bit on the pricier side but it's worth it for the service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Pukka. Came here with dinner reservations for 2 on a Friday evening, was greeted and had our coats taken at the door. Our server was friendly and attentive to all of her tables. 

The restaurant decor looks nice inside, the food and spices smelled fragrant, and it's a modern take on Indian food.

(I'm Punjabi) and I thought the food was fresh and delicious. We ordered the Chicken Tikka, Butter Chicken, Pumpkin Curry, Crispy Okra Fries, Rice, and Garlic Naan, which was shared between the 2 of us (with food leftover for my partner's lunch the next day). All of our dishes were tasty. The Chicken Tikka is tender and accompanied with a delicious tamarind sauce, the Butter Chicken was nice and balanced (and had lots of chicken pieces!), the Pumpkin Curry was perfectly spiced, and the Crispy Okra Fries were a great idea. The basmati rice had a certain nice fragrance and taste to it, considering it's rice. 

Overall, I had a good experience and I would come back."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighbourhood. Menu changes seasonally, the flavours are enticing, the staff is friendly and the wine program is spectacular. The sea bass is to die for."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while simply because it's always interesting to see what 'fancy' Indian restaurants have to offer. Originally, my husband and I went thinking we would get the winterlicious menu but we were ultimately wooed by their regular menu. Front of the house, who we later found out was the owner, was very polite and welcoming, and took our coats. Service was good in general - all the dishes were described when they were brought to the table. 

Our order: 
String chaat - I love chaat! This doesn't pack the punch of an amazing chaat from a street vendor but it's a good introduction into the world of chaat for someone who has no idea what it is
Chicken 65 - sweet and spicy chicken bites with a South Indian flare, I enjoyed it
Bengali sea bass - fresh fish, great sauce, my favourite dish of the night, a very nuanced interpretation of a coconut based curry 
Kashmiri beef short ribs - the sauce reminded me so much of something my grandma makes so I appreciated the nostalgia, but it was missing something I can't quite put my finger on 

We skipped dessert, too full. We probably could have ordered another app or side (okra fries!) and shared one entree. Would this be my go to restaurant for Indian food? Probably not. But it was a welcome change from the sameness of options in this category."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food and incredible convenient using UberEats! So glad we tried this place, finally gourmet Indian delivery!"}
{"text":"Great dishes and good place to go if you're craving Indian in the St Clair west area. A little bit pricier but also nicer than regular Indian joints."}
{"text":"Extra information:
* Vegetarian option Avail
* Takes reservation
* Open for dinner only

Last time I was in St.Clair West and Bathurst area was to check out the much beloved Stockyards back when it was still warm in Toronto. This tells you how rarely I am in this area but just last week I was happy to drive out to check out a new Indian restaurant called Pukka which opened not too long ago.

The restaurant is owned by Derek Valleau ( former Operations Manager at Crush Wine Bar) and Harsh Chawla ( Restaurant Industry Consultant)- with their experience and strong knowledge about food and wine, wanted to come up with an awesome Indian restaurant with a contemporary twist.

Interesting thing about Pukka is that they have wine pairing for all the dishes they serve. This is quite unusual at Indian restaurants and that's something special Pukka decide to bring to the neighborhood. On our visit, Sommelier Peter Boyd gave us detailed information about wine pairings.

Vegetable String Chaat
* Puffed rice, sprouts, chutneys and sweet yoghurt for $8.70
* Very light on dressing, this had many different textures
* Perfect way to start your meal

Baby Kale Salad
* Dates, lotus chips with spiced cashew dressing for $8.40
* Kale is something I find to be too bitter but this was really good with the sweet dates
* Crispy lotus chips on top added flavor and crunch

Chicken 65
* South Indian fried chucken with chilli and tamarind sauce for $9.40
* This was my favorite appetizer out of all
* Usually served as a bar snack and I personally thought it would be awesome with some beer

Goat cheese stuffed Lamb kebabs
* Served with pomegranate reduction for $10.20
* I thought this dish will be pretty heavy overall but it wasn't
* Lamb kebabs were just juicy enough with the melted goat cheese ozzing from the middle
* Perfect with a glass of red wine

Poppadoms and Chutney
* Served with Mango chutney for $2.90
* Can you believe this was only my second time trying Poppadoms?
* These little sheets are packed with flavor and they are crispy like chips
* Savory Poppadoms and sweet mango chutney goes so well together

Spinach and Mushroom stuffed Paneer
* Served with pistachio korma sauce for $15.90
* This dish is usually very rich and heavy but it wasn't
* Very light in terms of spices and it was quite mild

Pan seared pickerel
* Covered in coconut and curry leaf for $23.90
* Another perfect dish to share family style
* Pickerel was crispy with its skin in even covered in that coconut curry

Butter Chicken
* Made with tomato infused butter sauce for $18.40
* This is not your usual butter chicken, it had all the necessary flavors without feeling too greasy

Beef short ribs
* Braised with black cumin, garlic and ginger for $21.80
* Short ribs were very tender and it melted in my mouth
* Should be ordered with naan bread or basmati rice so you get to scoop up all the sauce

French Beans
* Caramelized onions, turmeric and coconut for $6.90
* Nice vegetarian dish to order as a side 

Assorted naan basket
* Can't go wrong with naan bread
* Here you get different types of naan bread
* My favorite was the garlic naan

Eton mess
* Rosewater merigues, pomegranate, mango and sweet lassi cream for $7.90
* This was so good I might have to go back just for dessert
* I usually get sweet lassi to drink when I go to Indian restaurants
* Again, the dessert itself wasn't too sweet but when you break meringue into the cream, it was just right!
* Loved how they added pomegranate and mango pieces for extra sweetness and texture

Summary: It's been awhile since I've been to a Indian restaurant and going to Pukka really reminded me of why I love Indian food. The flavors, texture and different ingredients...there is just so much variety! And now you know Indian food isn't always the AYCE buffet that you walk out feeling greasy and smelling like what you ate. Pukka offers sophisticated Indian food, overall light but still packed with flavor. Make sure to visit the restaurant with 2 or more people since you can order couple dishes to share family style!"}
{"text":"I usually order the stuffed paneer or butter chicken or lamb lollipops, which are all fantastic, but recently I decided to branch out and got the beef short ribs. They were so tender, I literally cut them with a spoon. Incredibly tasty, I almost had the leftovers for breakfast the next day. They come with a generous portion of braising liquid, which is tomato-based? and has the most lovely spicing. It's not too spicy, just a warm heat that grows over time. The food is on the expensive side, but the portions are fairly large and the flavours are more complex/unusual? than all other Indian food I've had. Up their with my favourite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate three October birthdays (my mom's, my dads, and mine), and had an absolutely perfect meal. We ordered the veggie pakoras, gunpowder prawns, eggplant tartare, and kale salad to start, and everything was out of this world delicious. The prawns were so tasty we had to re-order because one taste wasn't enough. The mains (sea bass, beef short ribs, punjabi chicken, naan and rice) and dessert (the sweet plate of truffles and popcorn, plus a lemon tart) were just as impressive. Lovely, playful presentation, and absolutely fantastic service. 
We were all so impressed, and left full and super happy - it was our first time, but we will definitely be adding it to the rotation as a regular because it was so wonderful. Thanks to Pukka for one of our favorite meals this year!"}
{"text":"First time tonight at Pukka. I was impressed at the atmosphere which really suited a trendy St. Clair W restaurant. It was very modern and they played some funky music in the background setting a nice vibe. The chicken tikka wasn't dry which is hit or miss at many restaurants as it's white meat. We ate the butter chicken and the main dish with fish and prawns which was my favourite. They were very saucy though so I felt my choice of naan over rice wasn't very smart since the sauce was too good to leave behind. The best part is it didn't feel heavy or greasy like I'm previously used too. I'll
Definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Very cool mix of traditional Indian and modern."}
{"text":"Reserved for this cool joint a few weeks in advance and I highly reccomend that you do. Place was super busy on a Saturday night until 11 pm. Food was great, would highly reccomend. Good vibe.

Food we ate:

Snacks:
Eggplant tartare
Chicken 65

Eats:
Boatman's fish + prawn curry

SIdes:
Okra Fries (wicked)

and we had some naan/rice on the side. Good cocktails, and beer, all this food was more than enough for 2 people. Wanted to try a lot more food but I'm sure we can take a few more people back with us and try more items on the menu.

Service was very good, thanks Nicki, very helpful in recomending the dishes. I've wanted to check out a lot of the cool places in the St Clair West area, good start here."}
{"text":"As other reviews have mentioned, Pukka is not quite Indian food. It is \"Indian\" food with a twist. That being said some of the dishes are fairly creative.

Appetizers:

Vegetable Pekoras: really was just a deconstructed pile of pekora bits and little fry bit things. It tasted good. But it looked like the bottom of a deep frier crumb pile, as if someone else, somewhere in the restaurant, was hoarding all the good parts. 2.5/5

Beets and Paneer: We thought it was going to be a cheese plate but it was actually a salad (waaa, did I miss something?). I guess the Paneer was a crumble on top of the salad? I mean I ordered it wanting Paneer so I'm left kinda confused. But it was a tasty salad. 3/5

Squash Samosas: you only get 2 but they were sooo good! My favorite dish of the night. 5/5

Bread basket and rice: good but twice the price I expected for that amount of food. 2.5/5

Butter Chicken: delicious but nothing special to me, I give it 4/5

Chicken Curry: a little more interesting tasting curry than the butter chicken and with a nice kick and nicely cooked so 4/5.

Service very attentive. 5/5

I feel in the end this brings me to 4 stars. 

If you are looking for Indian food this is not where I'd recommend. It is more like a swanky  contemporary bar, and you're paying for it... that being said it's worth a try, the food is good, but it won't be a go to for someone like me."}
{"text":"This is certainly not your typical Indian restaurant. Go to Pukka for really great innovative Indian inspired dishes and excellent service. Some of my favourites include the Boatman Fish & Shrimp in a creamy Coconut Curry, the cumin spiced braised Beef Short Ribs and Seared Duck with curry apple. The Naan is baked fresh and is the best.... light and airy! For starters, try the south Indian fried Chicken 65 in tamarind and chillies, the Corn and Spinach Tikka and signature Pukka Chaat slaw. For those on a Vegetarian lifestyle there are plenty of choices on the menu. If you havn't been to Pukka, I definitely recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant ever. I have been to Michelin star Indian restaurants but Pukkas punjabi curry hits the right spot. Their chicken in general is quite good in appetizers and also in their main dishes. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The butter chicken was great, but the kale salad was one of the best salads I've ever had in my life. It's a bit pricey, but I didn't mind."}
{"text":"Flavors, service, and atmosphere was spot on..my partner (who is British Indian) and I had the pleasure of experiencing this little gem..fantastic"}
{"text":"My husband and I finally got a chance to have dinner at Pukka after planning for it over a year, and we were not disappointed! From the moment we walked in and got our coats taken care of, and our friendly and knowledgeable waiter and the ambience, we were off to a great start. We requested to be seated by the window and our request was fulfilled. 

Now the main part, the delicious food with generous portion sizes. We orders Chicken 65, Pukka Chaat, Quebec Duck Breast and Punjabi Chicken Curry, Bread Basket and mango Panna Cotta and they were all amazing!!! I would definitely reorder chicken 65, it was mind blowing! So flavourful and a very generous portion size. The Punjabi chicken curry and creamy Mango Panna Cotta is also on my reorder list! 

Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend Pukka if you are looking for fusion Indian food while maintaining authenticity coupled with great service!"}
{"text":"Service was good and food was great ! If you get garlic nan ask for extra garlic ...not much on there... Best Indian in the city since Babur closed .."}
{"text":"definitely start with the veg pakoras!

waitresses were dry. waiters were really friendly ."}
{"text":"Food 2.5/5 (50% of final grade)
From my experience with South-Asian restaurants (although limited), this restaurant didn't stick out as anything particularly special. If anything, the portions were small (perhaps due to Summerlicious?)... They had free refills of the rice though, so I guess the concentration was to fill our stomachs with the rice smeared with the gravies they drowned their entrees in.

Ambiance 3.5/5 (15% of final grade)
My party of four was seated at a high table, and placed delicately on our table was a candle in a glass holder. The general lighting was a cozy burgundy, giving the place a rustic glow that was both upscale yet casual.

Service 3/5 (15% of final grade)
Our glasses were always filled, they ordered our food promptly (as if they wanted us to order ASAP), and the food came fast. The appetizer came really fast and the entree came only after quite some time though. Also, it almost seemed as if they wanted to shoo us off, and although there wasn't anything impolite about what was said, their tone of voice was of annoyance-- we didn't even make any requests except to refill our rice once! I still give it a slightly above par mark for attentiveness though -- glasses filled, chums!

Cost 2/5 (10% of final grade)
I think for the taste aspect of the food I could easily find it for a much more affordable price elsewhere. That extra $20 bucks or so you're paying is for the atmosphere and the atmosphere only. 

Brownie Points 2.5/5 (10% of final grade)
The placement of the food was nice. Made for some picture worthy Yelp photos!

Final Grade = 53.5/100 = 3 Stars

TLDR: I guess it's an appropriate location to try out for Summerlicious, but not for its regular price."}
{"text":"Certainly not your run of the mill Indian restaurant, the unique food selections are delicious and the waitstaff are attentive and very professional. While the prices are slightly higher than the average Indian restaurant, you definitely get what you pay for. Pukka is perfect for celebrating special occasions with family and friends."}
{"text":"What came first: the wine bar or the nouvelle Indian menu? It's a chicken and egg kind of question. Either way, Harsh Chawla and Derek Valleau of new Toronto restaurant, Pukka, have hatched an exotic concept that, for a wine bar, is the most exciting menu in town, and for an Indian restaurant, is the most refreshing and forward-thinking.

We begin with monkfish elevated by citric flavours of mango, tomato and red pepper. A salad of greens with crumbled paneer and spiced pumpkin seeds in a chili-orange vinaigrette, and a tender dish of herb-infused Tandoori chicken tikka with tamarind chutney, are paired with a 2012 Grüner Veltliner, Rabl from Austria. Great thought is put into the wine menu, because the pairing has to compliment very distinct aromas as well as ingredients. This proves to be a versatile wine that harmonizes well with the salad in particular. Well-structured with notes of apple and lemon and a hint of minerality, it is lush without being sweet.

Crunching on crisp red chili-crusted okra fries, we are aware that this in not the typical Indian restaurant. We don't miss the usual suspects on the wine menu either. They have been replaced by a range of Ontario wines from Norman Hardie, Organized Crime, Tawse and Stratus to the new Kew Vineyards replace them.

Seared tender duck breast luxuriates in rich grape and lime chutney that we crave to scoop up with our warm naan bread, or ladle onto our rice served in a mason jar. There are those who suggest that when it comes to Asian cuisines, beer is a more profitable pairing than wine. For Peter Boyd, Pukka's wine consultant, \"Beer is tasty, but it's almost savoury in itself, and so its kind of angular; it doesn't really work with anything, it works against it. Beer bloats. Wine is tricky, there is no doubt about it, but with some things it does work better.\" The challenge is to find the right wine, and in this case the Rhone Valley Domaine de Lorient, with its plum-y blend of Syrah and Grenache, matches the essence of the duck and the tang of the chutney without being overpowering. It is a delicate balance and it marries beautifully.

We enjoy experimenting with wines and the exotic potpourri of menu items with which to pair. At Pukka, there is passion for good food and wine-- together in a happy marriage."}
{"text":"Mediocre Indian food is easy to find in Toronto...good Indian food is much more of a challenge, and Pukka definitely fits into the latter category.

The atmosphere is sort of relaxed chic, and there are a few sidewalk patio tables that are always hotly contended when the weather is nice.
Service is brisk and friendly, with a number of drop-bys to ensure that you have all that you need.

We were two and started with the pakora, which turned out to be a great variation on what \"standard\" pakoras look like. Instead of the round ball, this was more like a tempura style, with a crispy outer and a soft inside. The spices were just right to evoke the sense of a pakora.

We shared a chicken curry and a pumpkin curry (made with coconut milk), and they were a nice counterpoint to each other; the pumpkin was rich and slightly sweet, and the chicken had a bite to it. Coupled with plain naan, they were more than satisfying for two people (we took some leftovers home).

Many things were reasonably priced, but a fair number of menu items, IMHO, were pricey."}
{"text":"I really missed the Indian Rice Factory when it closed but it has been dethroned as my favourite Indian food restaurant not just in the city but anywhere really.  We enjoyed everything we had immensely.  For me, the stars of the show were the garlic naan which was amazingly light and crispy, the gunpowder shrimp, spiced duck breast and believe it or not the kale salad.  I'm also a huge butter chicken fan and this one certainly didn't disappoint.  Highly recommend trying this place.  Nice decor inside as well so good for a night out."}
{"text":"I ordered through ubereats tonight and couldn't have been more impressed by the food. While it is a bit pricey it is definitely worth it - the string chaat is a salad dreams are made of and the rose dessert is light and delicious! Seriously check this place out for innovative, delicious dishes that you will come to crave!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Pukka. It's not everyday that a high-end Indian restaurant opens in our neighbourhood. My husband and I love Indian food, so it was hard to imagine we wouldn't love this place.

Our experience, however, was only so-so. Lovely ambiance, attentive (if a bit starched) service, great presentation. But the food was simply not good enough to justify the high prices. 

We ordered the Kale salad, the stuffed paneer, the curry vegetables and the French beans, with a side of rice. Everything tasted very good. But nothing was out of this world great and some of it (notably the stuffed paneer) was bordering on bland. So why would we spend almost $20 per dish (and a strangely whopping $5 for rice) when we could get better flavours at half the price down the street?

The pricing was also odd, especially for a vegetarian. The side dishes are almost as large as the mains. So why is the curried veg almost $20 but the bean dish (which was actually more tasty) only $9? Why is rice, which costs pennies, almost as pricey as their side dishes? They might have some adjusting to do.

Perhaps this restaurant is really for meat eaters. There were some lovely looking meat dishes that might command their hefty price tag. But for the vegetarian diner, I'd suggest skipping this place and heading down to Banjara at Bloor and Christie for far more choice and better flavours.

Vegetarian Score = 8/10. Some choice here, although poor compared to most Indian restaurants. But - if you ordered only starters and sides, you could make a lovely meal for a decent price."}
{"text":"Really nice fusion of Indian style cuisine, I love the food here. Also really nice ambience and friendly servers."}
{"text":"Mmm...modern Indian. Tantalizing spice layering and fun wine pairings. Nice service. I like the mishmash approach of using different kinds of serving ware-- e.g. rice comes in the kind of glass jar that you'd usually store uncooked rice in. It gave me the feeling of being at a creative and cool, but still homey dinner party. 

The folks and I had:

String chaat
string vegetables, sprouts, rice crisps,
pomegranate, mango, chutneys + yoghurt 8.7

Sweet potato samosas
coriander-mint chutney 7.4

South Indian vegetable curry
coconut, tamarind + mustard seed curry 15.6

Punjabi chicken curry
home-style chicken curry 17.6

Lamb lollipops
turmeric, mint + coriander curry 24.9

Roti
whole wheat 2.9

Rice
steamed long grain basmati 4.6

I also had a a glass of meritage with our meal and a masala chai to end.

I particularly enjoyed the basic home-style chicken curry. My parents both loved the chaat appetizer. I will definitely go back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"I'm really quite confused as to why there are so many high reviews of this place. I came here on a Sunday evening with 4 other people. The restaurant itself is very nice and clean and the service is great other than the fact that the waitress recommended WAYYY too much food for all of us. She recommended that between 5 people, we should order 4 appetizers and 4 mains. We're all big eaters so didn't think much about it until the food arrived. We ended up ordering 3 appetizers and 4 mains and two mango lassi. 

We ordered the pukka chaat, vegetable pakoras and chicken 65 to start and the boatmans curry, butter chicken, punjabi chicken curry and the beef short ribs as the mains to share. 

The pukka chaat was delicious. It was fresh and crispy and a great start to the meal. It is on the spicy side which I didn't expect and wasn't too big on since I knew the chicken dishes would be spicy. 

The vegetable pakoras aren't your typical pakora. I wouldn't recommend this dish. It came in sticks of vegetables which were soggy and nothing special. I've had better at Indian buffets. 

Chicken 65 tastes like Hakka style chilli chicken. It also wasn't anything special considering this was one of their most popular appetizers. 

The boatmans curry was delicious. It was light and creamy. It's different from most other curries I've had. It was almost similar to a thai curry. For $32, this is a splurge. 

The butter chicken was pretty good. Tastes like your typical butter chicken. Nothing I would go out of my way for. 

The Punjabi chicken curry was decent in my opinion. I would never order this if it were up to me, but a couple of my dining patrons thought it was delicious. 

The beef short ribs were delicious. The meat was soft and sweet.

Overall, I thought the food was just okay. I don't think I would be back considering the price. I know that part of what your paying for is the cleanliness and service, but I'd rather pay less and ignore all that for better food."}
{"text":"I went to this place shortly after it first opened and it was excellent then. It must be about two years later and they have maintained if not even improved their standards. Things that I would recommend include, Sring Chaat, Chicken 65, Short Ribs, the new spicy chicken - Punjabi? And the lamb lollipops.
The wine list is excellent, the service great - normally at least one of the Owners is on the premises.
This is one of the best Indian meals available in Toronto."}
{"text":"I like Indian food and I have lived in India to be able to judge the quality of it. We had stuffed paneer, butter chicken and pumpkin curry. Also for starters we had poppadoms and samosas. Excellent quality of chutney which came with samosas. Samosas themselves were nice. Stuffed paneer was a bit overcooked not very soft although the curry was excellent and full of flavor. Butter chicken and pumpkin curries were very good. Naan was fresh and tasty. The service was  excellent. The girl who served us was very attentive and nice. Overall I enjoyed my time and the food. Very nice decor and atmosphere."}
{"text":"DE-LIC-IOUS!! As far as Indian food goes - this place is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Summerlicious 2016 ended with a bang.

memories of the Rogan Lam josh is still drilling holes in my memory. Honestly the best $28 I spent. i tried the halibut curry as well. Really Good. 

I am going to be back in order to try the steak vindaloo. I will give a more detailed review then.

However Pukka has amazing service- attentive waiters and food that is like no other. I eat a lot. This is an advanced take on Indian food which is already a pretty advanced method of cooking- with the various spices and stages it takes to make these dishes. 

Pukka makes it an effort to make food both an art and a science. Which results in the person who eats their food to go on a trip where they both get to discover and also appreciate the presentation.

Enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Sometimes Indian fusion can be a disaster - but this place does it really well. I loved the food and I am Indian. Brought my parents who enjoyed it as well. Their wine menu pairings are well put together as well. Good ambiance and service was excellent. Yes I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Pukka serves delicious and inventive Indian food. The vibe inside the restaurant is trendy and chic with dim lighting. All of the unique food combinations were mouthwatering and we enjoyed a feast! To start, we had the highly recommended string chaat, which combined tasty string cut vegetables mixed in with fruit, for a sweeter taste. This was my favourite dish on the menu, as it was fresh and had the perfect mix of sweetness and spiciness. The tandoori chicken tikka accompanied with tamarind chutney was tender and the chutney added a nice kick to it. We also had the crispy red chilli crusted okra fries, which were definitely a hit! I love spicy food and would definitely recommend the boldly flavourful steak vindaloo, which we had with the crispy garlic naan. 

Somehow, we made room for dessert and they did not disappoint. We enjoyed the chocolate torte, which had a hint of chilli and was served elegantly with an edible flower. The lemon tart was creamy and delicious, but the ginger crust was a little hard to break through.

Service is good with and we were provided with great recommendations. Pukka is an excellent alternative to classic Indian food with its bold flavours and inventive dishes."}
{"text":"Decent food, but nothing overwhelmingly amazing. Most of the food is certainly good, but forgettable. The flavours are good, and the cost is high."}
{"text":"Great Indian food but overall too pricey for the experience. The butter chicken ($19.90) was alright, not exceptional. Who charges 5 bucks for rice these days? Yes, there's only one kind of rice, long grain basmati, and it is $4.90 a portion. Bit disappointed overall on this second visit. Will probably not return but might give Ji, Pukka's sister pub down the road, another go. Lovely staff and décor, however."}
{"text":"Didn't think this place would be to great even though I heard awesome reviews I thought it wouldn't be authentic. After entering pukka I was pleasantly surprised with there authenticity 
I was aware it wouldn't be \"real Indian food\" 
But it was close and even if it wasn't authentic the food was good. They added a nice twist to Indian food"}
{"text":"While having a blast at the yelp's nautical event, we met a girl who asked us what our favourite restaurant was. After interchanging names and our opinion about the importance of the ratings, she mentioned that Pukka was one of those misjudged hidden gems and that we should give it a try. So we went.

We were asked by the host (owner or manager) if we had reservation (maybe because we were wearing really casual clothes, and the ambiance was more formal), but fortunately after he checked the list, he gave us a table.

I liked the service and the bar. The waitress was friendly, funny, and the dishes came fast. The decoration is eclectic; not much of an Indian exotic vibe.

They gave us a different menu for Summerlicious. But we opted to try the regular menu.

I didn't find the food extraordinary like my fellow yelper said. The presentation was average, and the flavour was just ok taking into consideration the prices.

We asked for the eggplant tartar, The chicken with tamarind, the Lamb lollipops, and the Boatmans Fish. 

My advice: try the tamarind chicken and the lamb lollipops (the must try) and if you need to choose, just ask for the lamb. The fish was over cooked and the flavour of the curry couldn't cover the fact that it lacked marination. The eggplant tartar was more like a sauce/dip, and my husband complained because I chose it...

They charge for the rice and they don't give you sauces."}
{"text":"Seriously, Pukka is amazing. It combines all of my favourite things: culinary creativity, clean design, and excellent service. The owners are wonderful and they take pride in their business. Every single employee is smiling from ear to ear - they seem genuinely happy and proud to be there.

The lamb stuffed with goat cheese is mouth-watering. The roti, naan, and paratha breads are freshly baked and delicious. The wine list is fantastic. All of the meat is sourced from Roast (a local, organic butcher located 2 doors down!). I love this concept. All local businesses should collaborate like this.

Our server, Nicki, was a real pleasure. Professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. Last, but certainly not least, the bathroom is pristine. I was so impressed that I took a photo of it. This is a place for all walks of life: bring your parents, your partner, your loved ones, a date, your grandma....it doesn't mater because everyone fits in.

BEST RESTAURANT IN ST CLAIR WEST. NO CONTEST."}
{"text":"We tried the Stuffed Paneer, Bread platter and the Dal Makhni. The dal makhni was oily. The stuffed paneer was tasteless. Indian food is supposed to be flavorful but the different dishes were anything but flavorful. It is overpriced for the kind of food we got. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you want to shell out money for no rhyme or reason."}
{"text":"I've been to pukka three times and always loved it!!!! The butter chicken and boatman curry are delicious. Almost all the curries are delightful! Lassi is good! And the apps are also good! The owner is very welcoming and warm and always comes around to make sure everyone is satisfied which is nice... Just too much money for what it is... If you are really craving Indian, pukka won't satisfy"}
{"text":"First I must say that I was a little taken back by the prices. I mean 2 pakoras for $8? A basket of naan for $5? Aloo ghobi for $13? Quite pricey for Indian food in my opinion. 

So after the initial price shock we decided to go for it and I must say the food is excellent. The butter chicken was amazing, the Aloo ghobi was great and even the dessert - eton mess was outstanding (it should be for $9 LOL) 
The service was very good too. 
Bottom line, if price is not a factor and you want a good, delicious Indian food, pukka is definitely the place."}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars. We came for early dinner tonight (they open at 5PM on Sundays) and the place was pretty empty, which was fantastic because partner and I could actually hear each other across the table. The place is very romantic - candlelit, bar seating availability, quiet. Service was very fast and polite - our server was very helpful with explaining the dishes and helping me navigate the vegan options. Be warned though, fellow vegans - this place is not super vegan friendly as most dishes, breads, and desserts/drinks contain some kind of animal product. 

We ordered all vegan tonight for me - the pumpkin curry ($14) and chaat appetizer I still highly recommend. The dal makhani (they can make this vegan/dairy-free if you ask!) was only so-so in my opinion.  There was nothing unique about the flavors and the only spice I could really note was the spiciness. Nothing was overly spicy, but everything was spicy. Don't order the whole wheat non-dairy naan/roti. It's thin, dried, and blackened. If you want naan and don't have dietary restrictions, just go for the original buttery versions. 

There is a 3 course prix fixe menu for $49/two people, but we decided not to get it because it only had 1 veg friendly option in the main course selection.

Prices are high (even small appetizers were over $10), but reflects the generous portion sizes and quality. We applied a $20 gift certificate (for if you spend over $50) that we picked up after an order from their pop-up at Saks."}
{"text":"Refreshingly different! Their kale & fried lotus root salad is excellent, as is the spinach & mushrooms stuffed paneer in pistachio sauce. The only concern is that they don't have enough vegetarian entrees on their menu - one has to order veggie dishes as sides.
For dessert we had the chai pot de creme - simply outstanding & eton mass - ditto. The chocolate chai to wash it down was simply the right thing to order. Definitely recommend this Indian fusion restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the most satisfying dining experiences that I've ever had was here at Pukka.

Every course that I had was well presented, very filling and mouth watering delicious. I had the Pukka chaat for apps, the South Indian fish curry for my main and cardamom rice pudding for dessert. I also had garlic butter naan and rosewater and cucumber G&T on the side. My only criticism would be that the basmati rice included with the South Indian fish curry was a bit too salty for my liking. I also discovered that I now love cardamom rice pudding.

My experience at Pukka was made even better by the great service that we got from the staff. Everyone was really friendly and informative. I also really appreciated that our tables were wiped after each course (something that I've never had before at any restaurant). The ambiance at Pukka is sophisticated and very inviting. Along with delicious comfort food, it is the perfect place to stop by for intimate get togethers. I look forward to stopping by again to try out more of the delicious food here at Pukka!"}
{"text":"Server recommended two starts, two sides, two entrees, and we went with that, unfortunately. Too much food. I get that this is kind of \"fusion\" here, but it is expensive having to order rice and naan separately. I mean, who eats Indian without rice and naan? The butter chicken and garlic naan are a must order."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! This place is a jam and right across the street from another fantastic restaurant. What a great little spot on St. Clair fantastic is all I can say"}
{"text":"Yum! All the appetizers were to die for. We got the chaat, goat cheese stuffed lamb, and chicken 65. We were all really impressed.
For the mains, they were all great but I would say only the Punjabi Chicken stood out. We also got the fish but thought the flavours weren't bold enough (I suppose they didn't want to overwhelm the Sea Bream). 
The Chai was not good, and it came out lukewarm with a ice cold cup. The panna cotta dessert was delicious, the carrot cake was good too but I wouldn't order it again. Service was fantastic and incredibly attentive.
All in all, definitely one of my favourite indian restaurants I've been too and I will be back."}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious and I must say I was impressed!  It's a small spot on St Clair W (it's sister spot Ji is just down the street).  

This place was pretty busy so I would recommend making reservations.  It serves higher end Indian food so the prices do reflect that, but the quality is worth it.

We had the chaat papri and the Chicken 65. Tthe chicken was nice and spicy and accompanied well with the chaat as this was cool and fresh.  The 2 apps balanced each other out nicely.

for mains we had the lamb and the curry fish.  The fish was nice and flaky and soft if a beautiful cream sauce.  The lamb..oh my...was a HUGE piece (think Fred Flintstone size).  It was tender, falling off the bone delicious.  It comes with basmati rice in a food container like jar (Indian people will know what I mean when they see the jars...lol).

The desserts we choose were the dark chocolate spicy ganache.  Definitely dark chocolate tasting - rich and smooth, but I couldn't really detect the spicy in here.  The other dessert we had was the mango pudding.  It tasted so fresh, so much like eating a ripe mango it was unbelievable.  It's probably one of the best deserts I've had in a long time and it's so simple.  

Will definitely be back to try this place again and it's sister spot - Ji."}
{"text":"If you've had authentic and traditional Indian food, you will not like this place. It's basically watered down to please people who have very little exposure to Indian food, such as sweet butter chicken that has almost no spices, mainly tomato and sugar, pakoras with ketchup, and some old chocolate dessert I couldn't break with my fork and hurt my teeth. It was a pretty disappointing summerlicious experience. The service is good though, that's why I'm giving it a star, but the ambiance is nothing special, not what you would expect for a fine dining place."}
{"text":"Excellently executed appetizers and mains. Highly flavourful lamb lollipops and short rib are highly flavourful and cooked perfectly.  Meat is tender.  Flavours in the gravies are exotic, yet balanced and refined.  Chicken 65 is lightly fried and delicious.  This is what I always expected from the high class food establishments everyone raves about in this town.  By comparison, I find those highly expensive stalwarts bland.  Want great tasting food, executed at a just as high a level as the jet set joints, with better flavour profiles, at half the price? Go here.  A real credit not just to Indian food, but food period."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and came here based on a good review, and we were NOT disappointed. My husband thought it was the best meal of his life. Everything we got was really good-- the chicken was fresh and not over (or under) cooked, the sauces had flavor and enhanced the food, and the naan was perfectly crispy. We got the chicken tikka, garlic naan, rice (huge portion!), and the Punjabi chicken. The atmosphere was also very nice -- trendy but not too in your face. Our waitress was also very good -- helpful and attentive but not too in your face. Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"I came to Pukka with my boyfriend on a weeknight. We made reservations beforehand but it wasn't too busy so for those who decided to walk-in, there were seats available right away.
Service was excellent.

DRINKS:
* Estrella Damm Beer
* Pomegranate Palmer (iced tea, lemonade + pomegranate juice)

TAPAS set of 3 (4/5)
* Chicken tikka (herb-infused + tamarind chutney)
* Stuffed paneer (Indian style cheese, spinach & mushroom filling + mild cashew korma)
* Gunpowder king prawn (moong bean salad + pineapple chutney)

I loved all three choices as part of the tapas set. The chicken tikka was very tender and juicy. This was actually my first time trying a paneer, it tastes like fried tofu haha - It's really delicious! The king prawn was very fresh. What caught my attention more was the moong bean salad that was paired with it, loved it!

BEEF SHORT RIBS (4/5) + naan bread on the side 
(braised with black cumin, Kashmiri chilli, garlic + onion)
Mm! The short ribs were delicious! The meat was very tender and it soaked all the flavours in. Our server told us this dish comes with a lot of sauce, so we ordered naan bread to dip on the side. 

NAAN BREAD (2.5/5)
We ordered the garlic flavoured naan breads - as a personal preference, I like naan breads with a thicker crust. Their naan breads were a little too thin for my liking.

OKRA FRIES (3.5/5)
(comes with mustard raita)
I love okras so we chose this dish.  The okras were very crispy. It was shredded and deep fried with their house sauce. Very appetizing! 

MANGO PANNA COTTA (2/5)
It tasted like mango pudding with caramel sauce (with a few pieces of cookies on the top). Not that special.

MASALA CHAI (3/5)
(black tea brewed with cardamom, cinnamon, ginger + warm milk)
My boyfriend decided to order this as a \"dessert drink\" after seeing another group order a bunch of them. What a cute display! There's a very strong cinnamon taste to this drink. I'm okay with this drink, my boyfriend loved it though!"}
{"text":"Now firstly i must say that the food was great and the service was also amazing but their are reasons that i give this place a 3 star rating. Now im not disputing the fact that the food was good but in my personal opinion compared to other high end Indian restaurants around Toronto and the world this place is rather over priced for the food you are receiving. If this were in the heart of downtown right by the harbour front or around Nathan philips i would agree with their pricing but they are located on st clair and their food is good but the spices i found were not 100% as authentic as they made it out to seem. As well the reason i gave this place a 3 star rating is because the waiter forgot our butter chicken order and we didnt get it until we asked where it was. but the waiter did make up for it by giving it to us for free. All in all i must say that the service was 5/5 but the food was a 3.5 at best just because it was overpriced for what you got."}
{"text":"I had a great meal at Pukka. The butter chicken is quite possibly the best I had in Toronto (Dhaba might be a close second). The chicken 65 was excellent as was the lamb kebabs stuffed with goat cheese. A solid meal. However, the short rib was a bit lacking in flavor (tasted like a very standard beef curry) while I thought the paneer stuffed with spinach and mushroom (with pistachio korma) was also quite bland. My friends loved it though. I would say it's worth a visit - it says indian fusion but I thought it was just solid indian food."}
{"text":"3.5

Modern Indian for a Western palate, this might be the only Indian restaurant in the city where there isn't a single Indian anywhere in sight. The spice is toned way down, which allows for a few gentle successes and some rather shocking disappointments. The butter chicken is terrible: someone decided it should be sweetened instead of spiced.

But you should go. And then you should go to Tich to see how it's really done."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, it's always consistent, the food is always good and the portions are large. I find it's a bit on the pricey side for Indian but otherwise no complaints. I will go again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a nice restaurant to eat on Saturday night. We were walking along St.Clair and saw Pukka. We didn't have reservations but we seated immediately. The hostess and waitress were very friendly and polite. 

I ordered the punjabi chicken curry and my boyfriend ordered the butter chicken. We also ordered the rice, n'ann bread and a bean dip - let me just say, it was AMAZING.

It was so delicious and we didn't wait long for it to be brought to our table. However, It was very expensive. We paid slightly over $100 (including a $15 tip). So definitely not a regular place we'd go dine at but if were craving Indian and looking for a really nice high end spot, pukka is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"Had a good but pricey dinner at pukka tonight with a couple of friends. Food was pretty good if you are not looking for the authentic Indian taste. The samosa had a good balance and did not have the over powering taste of fennel seeds or cumin. The lamb was excellent and very tender. The chicken 56 was spicy but was good. The ginger drink was very ginger but their guava drink lacked guava. Put down 3 but it is more like 3.5."}
{"text":"Lovely little Indian restaurant.  Nice setting, good service, and very tasty food. You got to try the chicken 65. Over all average prices for a lovely meal out. Hope to visit again soon"}
{"text":"According to Wikipedia \"Pukka is a word of Hindi and Urdu origin, literally meaning \"cooked, ripe\" and figuratively \"fully formed\", \"solid\", \"permanent\", \"for real\" or \"sure\". In UK slang, it can mean \"genuine\" or simply \"very good\". I'll go with the latter because that's the definition offered by our server when I asked for an explanation. In this case the name/term is relevant because it's one the owners chose, I believe, as a moniker to define and distinguish their establishment. This leads to a potential debate: Is Pukka a genuine Indian restaurant? Certainly one of their dessert dishes, despite how good their exotic rendition, is not. Or is this just an attention-grabbing device by its proprietors? 

Whatever the intent let me put your mind at ease that despite the authenticity splitting of hairs argument, it's definitely a place worth going to. That is if you are not looking for a classic, conventional, Indian restaurant. Think more along the lines of the well-established Amaya group of dining locations throughout Toronto. Or as Pukka's website describes it: Modern Indian. That also means that spicing is noticeably toned down. Is this a hallmark of modernity or appeasing Western diners? 

Appetizers are the obvious place to start. Worth trying is their Chicken 65 ($9.90). I have eaten Indian food for over three decades, in three countries, and had never seen it on a menu. It could be because it is a Southern Indian specialty, versus most Indian food offered in North America which is predominantly Punjabi or Northern Indian in origin. There are several interesting explanations as to the genesis of this dish. The simplest seems most convincing. It was first offered in Chennai's, capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, famous Buhari Hotel restaurant in 1965. Deep fried bite size chicken pieces are enhanced with ginger, garlic, chilies, vinegar and plenty of curry leaves - a de rigueur ingredient in this dish. Fried chicken, with more flavour than you might expect in a boneless version. My co-diner had to remind me on more than one occasion to slow down and take a breath between each forkful. It took all the restraint I could muster to do so.

There was no holding back by either of us as soon as we tasted the Okra Fries ($7.90). My fellow diner quickly announced that it was worth returning to Pukka for this dish alone! Dusted in chili and served with a side of Raita to cool your palate it's a real winner. Let me re-assure you that if you hold any hesitation about ordering it because of Okra's potential to be slimy, banish it from your mind. A common Indian staple but prepared split open in this dish, thereby eliminating any slick texture and then deep-fried. It could, if ever widely offered, give its' potato based counterpart a real run for its money. 

Papri Chaat is a Northern based snack food which comes in many variations. At Pukka they call theirs: String Chaat ($8.90) and consists of string vegetables, sprouts, rice crisps, pomegranate seeds, mango, chutneys and yoghurt. The name modification is probably due to string vegetables and pomegranate seeds not being typical ingredients and hardly included in either a restaurant based offerings or packaged versions that are common at Indian grocery stores. Pukka's modern or innovative rendition is beautifully executed and has sufficient familiarity that will still remind you of the traditional one.

After reading many enthusiastic reviews we settled on the European sea bass ($22.70), which is pan roasted and sitting on a bed of lentils with tamarind and curry leaves. This dish presentation and ingredients are quite traditional with one notable exception. The lentils were pureed, a variation you would rarely if ever see in a more conventional establishment. I found this change of texture quite pleasing because the lentils took on the role of a sauce. giving the mild fish some heft and unexpected zest. 

The final twist is their dessert offering of Eton Mess ($9). With no Indian culinary foundation or connection I can think of, I assume that Anglo-Indian ties that still bind inspire each other's cuisine. This well-known dessert derives its name from the independent English boarding school. According to the school's librarian it was served in the college's tuck shop in the 1930's and continues to be a favourite dessert throughout Britain. A real indulgence as the classic version is made of strawberries, broken pieces of meringue and cream. Pukka infuses it with Indian flavours by using lime meringues, including pomegranate syrup, and substituting regular cream for a sweet lassi one. A simple dessert that is transformed into a subtler version yet maintains its sweet, rich and absolutely yummy appeal.

Don't get too bogged down in the authenticity debate. Instead keep an open mind and savour Pukka's offerings, soon."}
{"text":"We chose this place, because they had items on the menu that could be made vegan while also satisfying the other half of our group that are meat eaters. Everything was really good. I especially enjoyed the flavors of the South Indian Vegetable Curry dish. As an appetizer, I ordered the Pukka chaat. I appreciated the option to omit the yoghurt, upon request. 

It's a beautifully decorated restaurant, and the service was exceptional. Very accommodating. When visiting Toronto again, returning to Pukka will be a must."}
{"text":"Pukka has been our go-to Indian spot in the city for several years. We've tried a lot of TO's offerings and no one else really does 'fine dining Indian' quite like Pukka. The Pukka Chaat is crunchy and fresh, the Chicken 65 is fiery and juicy, the Stuffed Paneer is warm and comforting, the Butter Chicken is rich and delicious, and the naan just soaks up all the wonderful sauces. The food is great, albeit expensive for the portion sizes. 

Our last visit, for my mother's birthday no less, left us with an unpleasant aftertaste. Our waitress was cold and frankly unwelcoming, making faces if anyone dared order a nonalcoholic drink. Bad night? Don't take it out on the customers! Or find a new day job. And don't make faces when your tip is less than 20% when you have detracted from a special night. 

Rethinking our go-to spot thanks to her.  Shame."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Pukka. The service is always great, the food is my favourite Indian that I've found in the city and delivery is always quick! 
So wonderful to have such a delicious and hospitable resto. in our hood! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this restaurant but the food was nothing exciting. I know the food is catered to Canadian palate, but most dishes are a disappointment, if you know what real Indian food should taste like. Not surprisingly, you won't see any Indian customers in there. The sweet potato samosas were ok, but I've had better samosas in hole in the wall places. The vegetable pakora was all crumbled. 

The mains are slightly better. The butter chicken was forgettable. The lamb lollipop and the spicy chicken curry were the only dishes with a bit of interesting taste and kick to them. The dessert of cardamom rice pudding was good, but the masala chai was very bitter. 

Afterwards I did have some leftover packed for take out, however it was packaged in a paper bag which leaked all over my purse and car, so beware of that. 

I'd give the service 4 stars and the food 2-3 stars. This might be a good introduction to Indian food, but if you have a bit of adventurous spirit and taste buds you should really try somewhere more authentic."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Pukka for a very long time, and Winterlicious provided a great opportunity for that! Overall, I love the cozy atmosphere and the warm, attentive service. Our waitress even gave us fresh rice with our leftover curry! Portions are actually pretty huge, even with the Winterlicious menu, so we left very full!

The drinks: My companion ordered the Pukka Cup, which was delicious, and my own non-alcoholic pomegranate lemonade was great as well!

The food:
-Chicken 65: While it wasn't what I'm used to with more authentic versions of this dish, the tamarind flavour in this iteration was a nice tangy twist. It was a nice starter!
-Coconut Seafood Curry: A lovely medium-spiced curry with fragrant basmati rice accompaniment. The portions of seafood were generous, and it was a very comforting main that didn't actually feel that heavy!
-Mango Panna Cotta: This was good but nothing to write home about. Very fruity, and a little on the heavy side. Really liked the water that came with it. I thought the portion was a little too large, where eating it becomes a bit tiresome.
-Rice Pudding: My dinner companion ordered this and I definitely had a bit of dessert envy going on. This spiced rice pudding was warm and sweet and honestly just felt like a culinary hug."}
{"text":"I find it ironic that the restaurant is called \"pukka\", i.e. \"authentic\", when the food is anything but. Not sure what \"Indian food with a modern twist\" is supposed to mean - diluted for North America?? I went for the Summerlicious menu and had the kale salad, the vegetable tikka masala, and the cardamom rice pudding. It wasn't terrible food, just altogether VERY bland. The kale salad was boring, the vegetable curry was nice but boring (had a lot of paneer though), and the cardamom rice pudding tasted like your standard rice pudding. 

Plus the server was very aggressive with upselling us on beverages - she must have asked about five times, pushing sparkling water, wine, and chai. Very irritating. 

In short, if you pretend to like Indian food but don't really like the spices that make it Indian, you can get plenty of paneer, \"naan bread\", and bland curries at \"Pukka\"."}
{"text":"The food is bland and tasteless. this isn't indian food..this is tailored to north american taste as are most restaurants within north america unfortunately."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Pukka.

The place looks fantastic and the staff were very helpful!

Tonight I found some new items on the menu that I haven't tried before at other Indian restaurants.

I was pleasantly surprised to see the variety of food that I could have gluten free, and that they served gluten free drinks as well.  I'm sober, but nice to see.

I ordered the pumpkin curry and the Punjabi chicken curry.

The curried pumpkin was to die for set off with coconut milk, kefir lime, and grape tomatoes.

The Punjabi chicken curry was quite extraordinary as well.  Very bold flavours and nice fat level.  Excellent touches of cinnamon!

I quite enjoyed the meal.

The prices are higher than most Indian restaurants I go to, but he food was well worth it.

If you've never been, and you like Indian than you need to go.

And lots of ginger on top!"}
{"text":"Reserved a table for Saturday night, with a couple friends. I was expecting Indian food, but not much else, since I didn't have time to look this resto up (which is what I usually do before going to a new restaurant). 

I was so pleasantly surprised! The casual atmosphere promised delectable dishes just from the wafts from the kitchen.

The unique dishes were sizable and absolutely delicious. Asking the waitress what her must-haves on the menu paid off. She was knowledgeable about the menu and the food and she was passionate about giving us a great experience. The service was impeccable, and Harsh and Derek were very present, you could tell they were very invested in every customers experience.

I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"A lot of the reviewers of Pukka tend to complain about the menu pricing, but they more than make up for it in the portions. I found they were very generous in comparison to other Indians places in town. We were so full, we couldn't finish it all. My dinner companion and I ordered the following:

Lamb kebabs 12.8
goat cheese filling + apricot chutney

Butter chicken 19.4
Mennonite-farmed chicken, fenugreek, tomato butter sauce

Fiddleheads + paneer 13.5
pan-tossed with tomato, ginger + garlic

Butter naan 2.8

We were quite pleased with all the choices. Although I don't know if I would order the Lamb Kebabs again. It was similar to eating a slider patty without the bun. I have a feeling they have better options in the apps section.

Secondly, if you like it spicy, make sure to tell them beforehand. The dishes above are not spicy at all by default."}
{"text":"Delicious. Went with a GF and shared a bunch of different items off of the menu including; Gunpowder prawns, naan bread, Kale salad, a bottle of wine. We had a cute server that was extremely attentive."}
{"text":"My partner and I were having a difficult time finding dinner reservations in the city for six people, as we were having a special dinner with family.
I eventually suggested we go to Pukka, which seemed to hit everyone's accommodations for dietary requests. Even better yet, they had a table for six available! 

When we arrived, we were greeted at the door by the two owners and a hostess who took our jackets and gave a warm welcome. Everyone was super friendly, knowledgeable and made us feel incredibly welcomed. From here we were introduced to the waitress who would be handling our table. While she was attentive throughout the entire service, she seems (at times) annoyed but some simple questions and requests that our table mates had about the menu and substitutions they wanted to make with a pre-fixe menu offering (as it only offered one vegetarian meal). We got a warmer reception from the table runner, which is kind of funny. 

Beyond the server, we had an excellent meal. Between 5-6PM, they offer a pre-fixe menu which garners you an appetizer and a full course meal. For a couple, this pre-fixe offering is $50. Not too shabby! We were unaware that the whole table needed to order from the pre-fixe menu, which kind of made things difficult (when people at made decisions) but overall, we figured it out and everyone was so happy with their choices. 

The food at Pukka is without a doubt some of the best Indian in Toronto. It's modern and authentic and for the price, you get so much food. All of us were able to take food home with us, which was an unexpected (but welcomed) surprise. Would we come back here? Absolutely! 

One note: it gets very busy here on the weekends. When we arrived around 5:15 PM for our reservation, it was nice and quiet. By the time we left at 7:20 PM, it was very loud and energetic. If you're looking for a quiet, romantic dinner. This may not be the place. But if you want to have great food, done right: get yourself down to Pukka."}
{"text":"looks like the word is out.. the place was buzzing on a saturday night. First of all, this is something toronto needs for a change in perspective on indian cuisine. The vision seems similar to what Vij's has done in Vancouver. The menu is mostly fusion concept but it also has some traditional dishes. We ordered an appetizer and 2 mains to get a broader perspective. The chicken 65 appetizer was yummy. The chicken was so tender and the seasoning was spot on. Being an Indian, chicken 65 reminds me of indo chinese style preparation but this was more south indian in nature.  Our favorite amongst the mains was the scallop and prawn ambotik. It had a great balance of sweet and tangy. The punjabi chicken was a simple home style preparation. For dessert we had the chai pot de creme which was delectable, we made sure we wiped it all clean. Overall, the portions are substantial for sharing, we had to pack our mains since we could not finish them.

Service was friendly although it took some time to take our order. Will definitely recommend this in a heartbeat and will be back again with friends."}
{"text":"I took my gf here for dinner, she is vegan, and they had a few different vegan options. We shared vegetable pakora, which was very yummy, and veggie curry on rice, which was not mind blowing, but it was p good. We also had two drinks, a rosewater gin and tonic, and a caeser for myself. The rosewater gin and tonic was strong, and flavourful. The caeser was like an indian twist on a traditional caeser, with spicy chilis and stuff. It was aight. The only thibg i didn't like wer da prices, hekka $$$ but not too too bad overAll a good place for a fancy indian meal. Our server kept using a kindda weird like silly voice tho, and i was like, nty stop. But she was knowledgable."}
{"text":"best indian in the city, if not, the country. the lamb lollipops and short ribs are stand outs, but every dish satisfies even the most judgmental palettes. for vegetarians, the chaat and pumpkin curry are a must!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Just down the street from us, my family and friends have all enjoyed the food, service, and ambiance of this place. I did find some of the dishes a little high on saltiness, which I like, but I probably shouldn't. 

Price is very reasonable. 

This review comes after a half dozen consistently terrific meals. My wife and I like to get in for the early bird prix fixe special, from which I always bring home leftovers. 

Their wine list is great, but I still find red wine and Indian to be a weird pairing, and prefer a beer with this food.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian food in the city.

What you'll find here is refined Indian food with creativity. Yet it's not a front - it's still the real deal in terms of flavours. It's not really fusion - it's a real Indian Chef who's serving food with a more modern approach. 

Surprisingly, the cocktail menu is also great. This is definitely a place i can see myself a regular at."}
{"text":"3 stars for a vegetarian and more like 4/5 stars for meat eaters. 

I had the kale salad, eggplant tartar and the vegetable curry main. All just ok. The kale salad at $14 was underwhelming. The eggplant tartar was nice, but a one note dish, lacking in complexity and depth of flavour that I have come to love and appreciate with good Indian food. The vegetarian curry was also ok but by no means the best veg curry I've had in the city. It was however the most expensive I've ever had.

The meat eaters at the table raved about the chicken 65 appetizer and the lamb and chicken mains. They were all very impressed.

I would still try this place again as I like the vibe and feel of it and I want to love the food. However as a vegetarian, I feel underrepresented on the menu."}
{"text":"After a long time, an Indian restaurant in the city that I can get behind.  What sets a Pukka apart from the gang is that it showcases that Indian  food, albeit a bit bastardized, can be cooked with finesse . At most other Indian places the cooking very much follows the  'Wham bham, thank you Ma'am' school of thought!

It's a small bistro, and very popular with the locals so reservations are highly recommended. It's quite cramped and gets very loud very fast.

We started with vegetable fritters and monk fish. The fritters were crisp to a fault, a bit too crisp, but because of the carom seeds set themselves apart from the fritters I've had at other Indian places.

The monk fish was very tender but the sambal was way too acidic for my taste and imho overpowered the fish.

The fiddle heads with paneer was a refreshingly unique pairing and it tasted very home cooked. In hindsight the crunch of the ginger was actually quite ok. Biting into the cardamom shells wasn't pleasant on the other hand.

We also got the boatman's curry which definitely felt like going through an ocean of curry, deliciously yet subtly coconutty. The pieces of fish in the curry were ample and worth fishing for!

The rice was delcious: fluffy and slightly scented with rose water and saffron.

Despite it being busy, our server never forgot about our table. Harsh, one of the proprietors, attended to tables as well. Kudos!

We were so stuffed that we bypassed desert. Yet another reason to return!"}
{"text":"I live in the St. Clair West area and I am really happy that now we have Pukka. it is Indian food really well prepared. Often in Indian food, the sauces seem to flow together but in this case Pukka's carefully prepared dishes are distinct, each separate and excellent paired with the protein. There are some very innovative dishes--a kale salad, tandoori eggplant, and the short ribs are a classic. Excellent use of spices, too. A nice place to be. Will definitely return. Try it...it's a breath of fresh air in the Indian scene in Toronto."}
{"text":"I found the food at Pukka really modern and authentic, and have been there twice for foodie events. The restaurant has a very nice vibe to it, and the neighborhood seems to agree given that it is buzzing even on a Tuesday night with an ice storm outside.

Some of my favorite dishes there are the gunpowder shrimp, and the beef ribs which are fall-off-the-bone tender. There really isn't anything I didn't like there, and I find their use of spices suit the dishes perfectly. I feel they perhaps toned down the heat on some of the dishes to suit our palates more, but it did not take away the delicious of the food there.

I would totally go back to Pukka again and again. A minor thing that I would like to see improved is their beer selection, which I think could be expanded just a bit."}
{"text":"Winterlicious Dinner 2015 Review

What my 7 friends and I liked..

The space was spacious, open, and clean with a modern feel
The staff was friendly
Service was efficient
The mains were delicious
Great portions
They accommodated my friend's gluten intolerance
The Mango Mousse was heavenly - tasted like fresh mango \"air\" that melted in your mouth - sweet and perfect
The Chilli Chocolate Torte did in fact have a chilli kick which I loved - too often chilli is mentioned but you would never know there was any in the dish
The naan was crispy, fluffy, buttery - everything you want a great naan to taste like

What we did not care for..

Though the staff was friendly, they were hard to flag down. I found myself spending a great deal of time waving my arms in the air trying to get the attention of a staff member to get basic items such as spoons for the curry
Owners were at the door, sometimes just standing there doing nothing, when they could have stepped in and assisted the customers that were calling out for assistance - they eventually did, but I should not have had to jump up and down like a student dying to get permission to go to the washroom
Tap beer options are limited, and all under 6%
The kale salad was a huge disappointment - bland, lacking contrast and textures, and swimming in a flavorless dressing. My belief is that if you have to bathe a dish in a sauce, or a dressing, it is because the flavors suck on their own and this is a last-ditch effort to make the dish edible - sure the lotus root chips were a step in the right direction
The naan was not included - so we paid for it separately
I had emailed the managers before my reservation with a query, and they never got back to me

So was this meal a good deal?

Winterlicious cost was $25 + tax and tip (15%)= $32

Regular price would have been $8.90 for the Vegetable Pakoras + $17.60 for the Punjabi chicken curry $7.60 for the Chilli Chocolate Torte = $34.10 + tax & tip (15%) = $43.65 (other items may vary in price).

Price difference was $11.65"}
{"text":"The food itself is a hit and miss! Loved the appetizers especially the corn tikis. The butter chicken we ordered had too much garlic. The strange part is, the mains don't come with either rice or naan and they need to be ordered separate. Never experienced that before. I think they should add a side of naan or rice since the prices are on the higher side. $20 for a butter without takes. Overall a decent experience. The prices are high and the food is decent at best."}
{"text":"Not sure how this was rated one of the best Indian restaurants. 

The lamb chops were great and also okra fries. Order these.

We also got the chaat, and butter chicken. Meh, nothing special. 

This is no way on a similar level as Dishoom in London, Vijs in Van, Junoon in NYC ...there is no comparison in quality, ambience, taste and experience. Our waiter was in a rush and kept calling the naan, bread. 

I would argue Tich is better in Etobicoke for Indian food if your in the GTA."}
{"text":"Simply fantastic.

Everything was perfect.

'Nuff said."}
{"text":"LOVED this restaurant.  The food was delicious and creative and the service was excellent.  Looking forward to returning, and having the chicken 65 as well as the delicious mango lassi."}
{"text":"My experience here was a wonderful one... not only did they serve delicious dishes, the service and atmosphere definitely elevates it higher than other Indian restaurants.  I would say that this would be the perfect spot for anyone who love Indian food or new to it.  Definitely make this a spot for you to try.

The restaurant is a lovely modern atmosphere with lots of exposed brick and sunlight coming in from the large windows up front.  The tables are wonderfully well spaced so you get your own personal space and you're not claustrophobic.  One thing I appreciated is their gentle touch of Indian accents... it's not in your face with huge pictures of Taj Mahal or elephants.  It's the subtle accents of Hindi that gives a hint of the type of cuisine.

One thing that was a standout was the service... just super warm, well informed of all dishes, and just generally fantastic and attentive.  They were able to recommend their top dishes to our palate and create a wonderful meal.  We ordered the vegetable pakoras, stuffed paneer, butter chicken, pumpkin curry, masala chai, bread basket, and mango lassi. 

Vegetable pakoras - this is a bit of a modern twist as it was more like vegetables fries dusted with crispy skin of chickpeas.  Usually I see shredded vegetables and made into more lacework patties.  Either way, nicely fried up and crispy. But I would say at $9, it is possibly the most expensive set of vegetables fries I've had in a while.  I think my fries at other Toronto high end places were only $7.  I can see why people comment on how this isnt value. 3.5/5

Stuffed Paneer - Gorgeous presentation, wonderful flavours... if you're carnivorous or vegetarian, I would say this is a must order.  A touch of heat adds to the creamy cheese that has a denser texture.  The curry underneath is a perfect compliment. 4/5

Butter Chicken - It seemed it had a giant tender chicken breast or 2 medium sized chicken pieces in this dish.  The chicken was perfect texture.  Definitely a step above your usual fare... wonderfully balanced in terms of spice.  It would be a good starter to anyone.  I admire the gentle hand for the butter... it wasn't super oily and did not have an pool of butter on top.  4/5

Pumpkin Curry - This stole the show... how does a purely vegan side dish do this?  Great spice balance to compliment the soft tender sweet squash.  The coconut milk adds to it and tempers the light hit of spice.  Just amazing overall 5/5

Bread Basket - you get 3 types... roti and 2 types of naan.  At first this seemed expensive but we barely had room to eat all of them so if you have at least 3 people, would recommend to get this. 4/5

Masala Chai and Mango Lassi - The chai was creamy and very flavourful of cardamom.  I was expecting a bit more cinnamon or ginger but still a nice drink.  The mango lassi was good as well.  Nice tartness and not overly sweet. 4/5

Overall, very well executed food with excellent service.  Possibly the best overall Indian restaurant experience in Toronto for me."}
{"text":"The food in this place is fabulous. It's not your typical Indian offering. It's more upscale, with interesting flavours. The atmosphere is great. Again, it's not your typical Indian restaurant ambience, but instead, it's a cool-chic bar ambiance. It's easily one of the better Indian restaurants I've been to in a long while, and it would have been perfect, if it were not for one major draw back: you get very little bang for the buck.

For appetizers, the \"Kale Salad\" is delicious, but small for $11.80. The \"Samosas\" are filled with sweet potatoes and are a step above you average samosas, and are a better value at $7.80. \"Chicken 65\" ($12.60) is a must - it's full of rich flavours. For the mains, the \"South Indian Vegetable Curry\" is beautiful, but on the expensive side - $17.60. The \"Pan Seared Pickerel\" is a nicely cooked piece of fish in very rich tomato gravy, but is a small portion for $24.70. The \"Boatman's Fish Curry\" has fish and prawn in a very rich, yet delicate curry. Again, it's not very big for $27.40. The \"Butter Chicken\" ($19.40) is a step above your average butter chicken. The \"Okra Fries\" ($8.70) are beautiful.  

The restaurant boasts an elegant bar. Unfortunately, it's one of the weak points of the restaurants. For starters, it's very slow to take drink orders at the dinner tables, and even slower to bring out the drinks. Secondly, it has limited selection. I wanted a Jack Daniels, and they did not have it. What bar does not have Jack? Third, the drinks are expensive. As alternative to the Jack, I got the Woodford Reserve (which is a beautiful bourbon aged in a cherry cask), and it set me back $11, which is a high price. Forth, the pour is very stingy. Several of us complained that the serving was much smaller than a full ounce.

The service overall is pretty good. We were a party of 10, and we stayed at the restaurant very late (well past all the other diners have left), and the manager kept the place open for us, and had the nice tact of not letting us feel like we overstayed our welcome."}
{"text":"Tasty, modern Indian food that's not served in a thimble. Excellent service. We'd been put off by the prices, but when our server explained that the menu is a tasting menu with dishes designed to serve a few people, the prices seemed quite reasonable. We also had received a postcard with a $20 voucher. Pukka puts a twist on some traditional dishes. They certainly know how to cook shrimp. We went back several times."}
{"text":"On a recent trip through Canada, we visited Toronto for a couple of nights.  We had eaten a lot of rather heavy French food along the way and were looking for the ethnic flavors that we crave.  We had heard that Toronto was a great food town and were looking forward to exploring some new places.  I discovered Pukka on Now Toronto's list of Toronto's 25 Hottest Restaurants (http://www.nowtoronto.com/guides/restaurants/2014/index.cfm?page=1) and, based on the photos, excellent reviews and interesting menu, we set out on a rainy Tuesday.  

Now, I am a HUGE fan of Indian food.  I have taken classes, experimented a bunch, and cook it with regularity.  And I don't say this lightly, this was perhaps the best Indian meal I have ever had.  My favorite dishes were the Kale Salad (which I could eat as a meal, nightly) and the Chicken 65.  Our server was knowledgeable and so friendly and helpful in guiding us in our choices.  They modified one of their cocktails to satisfy my craving for a cucumber martini and my husband's wine choice was excellent.  I loved the pappad that came in little cone shapes.  I imposed on the owner to sit down with us so that I could gush about his restaurant.  I told him we've got great Indian food in Chicago, but nothing like this!  Please, you must come to Chicago!  And in the mean time, please, I beg you, give me those recipes!  He kindly tolerated my exuberance and generously agreed to do so. :) 

We can't wait to go back to Toronto and to Pukka!  

P.S. The portions are enormous.  Bring friends so that you can share and try more."}
{"text":"Butter chicken is great, service was also very good. Nice vibe, good food, definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"4 stars because of the service. Waitress was very nice, my guy got annoyed of all the interesting conversations we had, but she was very attentive which I personally love. Non pretentious service at its best! The food now.. I expected more flavor for an Indian restaurant.. I have to say, I had better Indian food, packed with way more flavor. The salads and the lamb lollipops was Amazing but the regular traditional Indian curry chicken was A. Okay.. The drinks are great, I'm tipsy right now as I am writing this, so you know I don't waste time. Would I visit again? For service and drinks and apps wise.. Absolutely. But for the mains.. I rather go to my main spots for Indian food. I still recommend, but they need more flavor.. I can't lie. Sorry. Lol"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the team at Pukka. 

I had heard a lot about it - and had suggested it to a friend who wanted to book a nice Indian place for her birthday. We looked at Ji (Pukka's sister bar) and Pukka - and I thought that the menu at Pukka would more conducive to a lovely dinner party.

Well, I was correct. 

As soon as we walked in, the aromas of the masalas were amazing. 
It's hard to screw up Indian food - but it's been done, especially in the hip/trendy areas of the city; but I knew that these guys had it nailed as soon as we walked in. 

The service was excellent - our server was on point all evening - and it was packed in there. 

I'm not going to go through all of the dishes, because I think everything is good on the menu. 

The only thing that don't agree with, and I see this in trendy Indian joints, is changing for chutneys. It's ridiculous. It's like being charged for salsa at a Mexican place. 

Go to Pukka ... you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just a great, top-grade place for Indian food. It's pricey, which I'm sure some will complain, but the food is really good."}
{"text":"Pukka is a hip, modern Indian restaurant with a clean somewhat narrow interior. The ambience works well for groups but may be a bit loud for an intimate evening for 2.

A group of 5 recently had the price fix Summerlicious menu. The consensus on the Chicken 65 app was delicious but could use more spice. The eggplant tartare was decent but small and lacked complex flavours.

The lamb rogan josh and butterchicken mains were a hit. The vegetarian in our group was mildly disappointed in the  vegetable curry. An off price fix kale salad was ordered but was also not fantastic (too expensive for the serving size and did not have the promised spice)

Desserts were great (chili chocolate torte) to above average (rice pudding and mang mousse).

Pukka is worth a check if you want an upscale Indian alternative - just don't expect the typical blend of true indian spices and flavours you get at 'hole-in-the-wall' establishments."}
{"text":"Spectacular food, presentation and service at reasonable prices.

The food at Pukka takes the very best elements of Indian food and condenses them into plates of culinary wonder. I'm not trying to sound poetic - I'm no poet, or even a very good writer! - but that's the best way I can come up with to describe the food. 

It was a wonderful experience and I can't wait to try their newly-opened French restaurant."}
{"text":"Owed by Derek Valleau (Crush Wine Bar) and Harsh Chawla (restaurant industry consultant), Pukka (@pukkatoronto) definitely introduce a playful, chic, contemporary take of Indian cuisine to St Claire West. I was lucky enough to be invited by Vicky (@momwhoruns) to their media event, not only was the food amazing but also a very fun and intimate with only around a dozen of bloggers around a big communal table.

 Pukka means solid, genuine, authentic and the owner thought it's a fun word to use as the name of the restaurant. In British slang, it also means first class or absolute genuine.

With Chefs who previously worked at Scaramouche and Amaya, they have developed a solid sized menu of Indian classics as well as more Western inspired flavors and ingredients such as the Goat Cheese Stuffed Lamb Kebabs and Eton Mess dessert we have.

 For a Tuesday night, there wasn't an empty seat by 7:00pm

Peter Boyd (Scaramouche Sommelier) came up with some great wine pairing which wouldn't be easy task given the bold flavors of Indian dishes.

Our dinner was paired with a white and a red wine :
~ 2012 Pinot Bianco, Nals Margreid Italy $46
~ 2012 Cotes du Rhone, Saint-Michel France $9.30/glass $45/bottle

Baby Kale Salad
~ dates, lotus chips, special cashew dressing
~ This was so good, fresh crispy with the nutty dressing, the sweet dates and the perfectly crispy lotus chips. 
~ Perfect combination of flavors and textures.

 Chicken 65
~ South Indian Fried Chicken , chilli-tamarind sauce
~ Why 65? Some people says it's made from 65 types of spices, some said it's made 65 times before it's successful and some says it's invented in 1965, a dish originated from Chennai, India and is normally served as a bar snack. 
~ This was perfect with our white wine, can't help but wanting more.

Goat Cheese stuffed Lamb Kebabs
~ pomegranate reduction
~ Not sure how Indian this was but it was delicious. 
~ The cheese oozes out when you cut into it although filled with cheese, it was surprisingly not heavy at all especially with the dipping sauce.

 Vegetable String Chaat
~ puffed rice sprouts, chutneys, sweet yogurt
~ Love the presentation but unfortunately both texture and flavor felt flat especially after the previous dishes which had stronger flavors. 
~ Maybe this should have came first.

Assorted Naan Basket
~ I try a few flavors but I do like the plain one the best

Poppadoms + Chutney
~ This was so addictive, we all agree that we can munch on them all day long. 
~ As if the crispy goodness wasn't enough, it came with a passion fruit chutney.

Daal Makhani 
~ slow cooked black lentils
~ This was a side dish but so delicious that I wouldn't mind just having this with some naans.

 French Beans
~ caramelized onions, turmeric, coconut
~ This was bland, forgot the salt? Not sure but the beans was crisp and refreshing which is a pretty good side for all the other dishes.

 Pan Seared Pickerel
~ coconut, curry leaf
~ I am usually not a fan of cooked fish but this was delicious with the crispy pan seared skin of the fish that's so yummy with the thick coconut curry sauce. 
~ Due to the more delicate texture of the fish, I find it perfect with the Basmati rice rather than the naan


Beef Short Ribs
~ braised with black cumin, garlic, ginger
 ~ This was very tender, fall off the bone good and a great break from the other creamy option

 Butter Chicken
~ tomato infused butter sauce
~This is by far my favorite dish of the night, love the strong tomato flavor which was so refreshing and the chicken was super tender but feel like that some spices are missing... 
~ it didn't prevent me from mopping the plate clean with a naan.

Spinach + Mushroom Stuffed Paneer
~ pistachio korma sauce
~ I usually love paneer and I have to say I was a bit disappointed since it was rather bland. This was probably the only dish I didn't like that night.

 Eton Mess
~ rosewater meringues, pomegranate, mango, sweet lassi cream
~ Found the dessert not very \"Indian\" although it was very delicious.
~ Nice presentation and also a perfect palette cleanser to end the meal


Verdict :
~ This is definetly not the usual overly heavy Indian food. This is refined!
~ I usually find the spices in Indian Cuisine overwhelming and difficult to digest but not here.
~ Can't wait to bring Ben back to try everything"}
{"text":"We had the before-6pm menu for $25 per person which includes a started and an entree. As starters, we had the eggplant and the chickpea tempura (both vegetarian). I had the South Indian Vegetable Curry as a main dish (vegetarian), the other people at the table went for the fish. Every single dish was very good. The presentation of the food goes significantly above your average Indian restaurant. The same goes for the service and the entire atmosphere of the restaurant. Everything is highly professional.

Two negative comments:
- It is very expensive. But as most times, you get what you pay for.
- The desert, a mango mouse, was good, but could have been more exciting, especially for the price. 

And finally: I usually complain that restaurants are too cold. But we came to Pukka on maybe the hottest day of the year and the restaurant was very warm. Given that this is only a problem for maybe 3 days in a typical Toronto summer, I didn't take it into account for the rating. But it added maybe a little too much to the South Indian atmosphere for my taste!"}
{"text":"I'd heard this place was \"overpriced\" for the food they serve so it took us a while to actually get out and try it for ourselves. I'm so happy we did! This was delicious \"fusion/westernized\" style high-end Indian food!

We ordered three incredibly tasty dishes:
1) the string vegetable chaat: WOW the texture and flavours were so unique. It felt light but filling.
2) the Steak Vindaloo: perfectly cooked sliced steak (although the cut wasn't specified?). sauce had tons of depth and spice. also didn't feel too heavy even though it was a meat dish.
3) The French beans with onions and coconut: perfectly crunchy green beans, toasty flavour from the coconut and onions. 
Also: we had rice, naan, and the chutney platter (the chutneys should NOT be missed, everything on that plate had great flavour.

We will definitely come back here and try more dishes next time."}
