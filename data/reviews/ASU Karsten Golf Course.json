{"text":"For my boyfriends 30th had Karsten setup a golf outing for him & 19 of his friends. They did such an awesome job. Thank you Karsten for making it a memorable day!"}
{"text":"I'm reviewing the catering at Karsten's clubhouse (http://www.asukarsten.com/meetings_special_events/catering/). I have used the catering several times for large groups (100-175 guests). On all occasions, the food and service have always been exactly what we requested and definitely above expectations for such reasonable catering prices. 

Eating at the clubhouse in the winter season is especially lovely, since they decorate the entire area with festive lights and a large, beautifully decorated Christmas tree. At a recent December event, we selected a buffet which included vegetarian tamales, string beans with red potatoes, rice pilaf, and glazed carrots. There was also a turkey carving station. I'm very picky, and everything was excellent. The carrots in particular were really yummy with a candy-type glaze on them, but everything was above expectations. The coffee served also was surprisingly good, which is always a treat. 

I highly recommend the clubhouse at ASU Karsten Golf Course for your catering needs!"}
{"text":"Always have loved the layout here and the staff and shop are great. Course conditions this year are an absolute shock. I haven't played greens that slow and bumpy in a long time, very inconsistent mowing, tee boxes basically faded into the rough, greens had 2 different levels, ZERO sand in the bunkers. Sad to see."}
{"text":"This place is really cool. I was invited to play in a charity tournament here with a friend and had a total blast. *Disclaimer- I am totally not a serious golfer but even from a wannabe golfers perspective it was damn fun! 

The course has a ton of rolling hills so it's definitely challenging. They are great about having the drink carts circling regularly and the service is great from the second you drop off your clubs. 

One piece of advice is to plan for a full day here. It took us about 6 hours for the full 18 holes. Otherwise... go, play!!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful and challenging course. The staff is very friendly and professional. I enjoyed every aspect of this course with one exception. The restaurant in the clubhouse is very slow. It took 45 minutes for two eggs, coffee and some toast when I was the only customer there."}
{"text":"I hosted a wedding rehearsal brunch at the club house.  The event was beautiful.  The staff was really on top of things and very attentive.  The brunch food was delicious.  They event worked to move up the timing at the last minute that day.  I would highly recommend hosting an event here."}
{"text":"Great course in great shape.  I am a 20 handicap and it was challenging but I had several pars.  The greens were quick  but fair.  After a few holes you figure out how to use the links style to your advantage.  Good food in the clubhouse and friendly flexible staff."}
{"text":"I played this course several times weekly for three years in college and never ran out of money and never got bored with the course. You can see a lot of Pete Dye in this course - railroad ties, swails that are impossible to play from, so on and so forth. A very good challenge (It plays to a 73.8/131) with a shorter, narrower front nine and a relentlessly long back nine that finishes with four of the most difficult holes you will ever play. The signature hole is #16, a 248 yard par three with a forced carry over water to the green. The hole itself snakes to the right with water right and short, and the prevailing wind fights the fade you will want to hit. In 300+ tries, I've only ever birdied this hole once.

The staff is great. Always friendly and very nice to students like myself. The price is great for students, not sure about everyone else though. I've been to the restaurant only a few times, but the food was good and I would definitely go back occasionally if I still lived there.

Oh, how I wish I was back in college again. Being able to play this gem every time I had a chance made work+classes+malnutrition very bearable."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed by the round we played at this course. Beautifully designed course  was ruined by poor management. I've never seen anything like it. We played 13 holes in a little over 4 hours. We had to wait at every tee box and for every shot. Half of our group left after the first 9. We skipped 2 groups in front of us to try and speed things along but to no avail. If we had played the full 18 it would have been over a 6 hour round. Talking to the young men at the pro-shop, it seems to be a daily occurrence. They recommended playing mon-thur. when it's more open, but some of us have jobs! If this was the only course in Phoenix I'd quit playing golf before returning."}
{"text":"A first rate golf complex on the beautiful campus of ASU. The clubhouse is well stocked with ASU gear & serves tasty, reasonably priced lunches."}
{"text":"nice challenging course but with the slowest pace ever...5.30hrs to get through, waiting in every shot....thats really unacceptable on a course with 90 usd price tag.management should do something about it."}
{"text":"The driving range is great. Clean and reasonably priced. Go during the week it is empty."}
{"text":"It's sad to see that ASU, Ping, and Pete Dye came together and all that came out of it was a mediocre \"muni\" type course. the sand traps are dirt and some are grass probably because they game up on them. narrow fairways and high berms because most of the fairways run parallel to each other. I paid a low summer rate to play and I'da been really angry if I'da paid high rates in the cool season. the one excuse I can think of for this track is the piece of land they had to work with. pass this one by. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Go Devils! I'm biased because I am a Sun Devil myself 10'. That being said, this is an excellent course to test your skills. I personally got powned here as I under estimated the difficulty and overestimated my game. The price I have paid in the past hovers around 25 for the round and includes the cart. The course is well maintained with a Marshall & beverage cart constantly in motion. This is my favorite course to play when it's \"desert hot\" out here, due to the fact they they provide ice cold towels on the holes with cold drinks too. The staff is excellent, and they treat you the same regardless of skill. The pro shop has some sick custom ASU golf stuff and a bar with breakfast/lunch. They also do a \"golfer of the day\" drawing when the winner receives a free round and complimentary gifts (I won). 

The course in my opinion is tough. We were with beginners but also a few decent golfers,and we all struggled at some point. Very hilly, and the greens play fast making them difficult. The desert shrubbery can get you in trouble, but if you keep it it straight, Karsten rewards you. It wouldn't be my first choice if I was on vacation for one weekend here; Troon, but if you want a perfect golf experience with the boys then this is where you play. Thanks again Karsten Golf ASU."}
{"text":"Played in Wilson's group today and agree. Look at the yardage & play from the proper tees! A few marshals on the course would definitely improve pace of play. Would definitely like to play the ASU Karsten Course again."}
{"text":"Finally got around to playing Karsten, and with all the hills and moguls is definitely a unique course.  Extra challenging the first time due to a number of blind shots.  It was impressive how well the design works to mask that you're in the heart of Tempe

Booked an early morning tee time for $30 before fees, and I was surprised how good the condition was for late mid-June . . . for the most part.  The greens were FAST and a bit like putting on a pool table, unfortunately 

They could certainly spice up the 9th and 18th holes though.  They play along a long lake, but were a bit lifeless outside of that.  And $4 for a bottle of Diet Coke?  Jeeze"}
{"text":"Errrr my god. I wish I played golf when I wver to ASU. This course is pristine and gorgeous. A country club for those who can't afford one. Club house is amazing and usually has good deals on ASU merchandise. Breathtaking view!"}
{"text":"I give this course 4 stars because of its challenge level. Not at all the most scenic golf course, but the gazillion hills create an extra level of difficulty. I'd bet money that this course was once a landfill (yes, it happens). No flat lands accept for the middle of the fairway and greens. I do love the golf attendants uniforms....old school with the argyle socks and knickers."}
{"text":"WOW! From the attentive and smiling attendants out front at Bag Check to the well kept driving range, this place is definitely a hidden gem.  Word on the street is that they are closing, shutting down or some think it's already closed, but let me tell you that Joey Jones and his guys at Karsten are OPEN and they kick butt.  I am saying all these nice things in the beginning because even though this course is in amazing shape, it is definitely challenging.
I have played here 20+ times and each round continues to challenge my game!
I highly advise anyone looking to play true Links Style Course to go play ASU Karsten"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this course but I am saving the 5 out of 5s for the Troons, Grayhawks and WeKoPas of the world.  Nonetheless, this is a great, very challenging course and you don't have to drive waaaay up north or east of Scottsdale to get there, which is always a great plus.  I remember Golf Digest did a list of Top 25 College Courses and this didn't make it, which I thought was nuts.  My only complaint is that the course isn't really as luxurious as the peak season rate would indicate.  Also, as the other guys who reviewed this mentioned, there is some fantastic ASU swag available in the shop if you are a fan, they probably have every variety you could ever imagine.  Haven't eaten there but Ted's Hot Dogs is close enough that you'd be crazy not to go there after your round."}
{"text":"The course  was in average shape . The greens  were a little   bumpy answer slow. The place e of play was 5 and half hours the rough was thick. .the cart girls came around  often.the food was average. I did not like hitting  off mats on the range. It is a great layout  but two parts 4 close to 500 yards is too much"}
{"text":"I honestly have to say this is one of the best tracks I have ever played. I love the layout of the course. Pete dye did an amazing job creating this gem. Tight fairways, small greens, and great par 4's that you will remember forever! One of my favorite things about this course is the amazing customer service as well. Everyone is super friendly and you feel like a member when your walking around the place. The restaurant Is top notch as well. Huge portions for breakfast and lunch. I would def recommend everyone to play this course several times!"}
{"text":"I finally got to play the home course to my old stomping grounds, Arizona State University. I went to ASU fresh out of high school, but didn't last long because of a terrible GPA - at that time, I was not an obsessed golfer like I am now. So I never made it out to Karsten.

I walked into the Pro Shop and was like a kid in a candy store. They had ASU shirts, gloves, shoes, hats, flags, bags, head covers - anything and everything. I got a couple of shirts and a cap, and met the other golfers in my group.

Thankfully the other players in my group had played here the day before - so they were able to give me all kinds of tips from their experience. 

The course is in great shape. The front nine is not very scenic, the nearby factories, power lines and water towers provide the backdrop. However, the magnificent campus stadiums provide the scenery on the back. Being a former Sun Devil, seeing Sun Devil Stadium as we came down the 18th fairway brought back many memories...

The course is pretty tough. There is a ton of water in play, and it is by far the thickest rough I've ever seen. It made it very tough to find your ball and even the shortest of chips were difficult. Some rough was 6-8\" high.

Overall, a great bargain ($70), a fantastic Pete Dye design, and awesome views of campus. 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Great location overlooking the golf course at adjacent to ASU main campus.  Loved the outdoor seating.  The menu was very good and the prices were quite competitive.  Big thumbs us on this one."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review is only for lunch at the club house.

My primary colleagues in Phoenix love to come to the club house for lunch, particularly since it's just a short drive from their office off of University.  I've been here a dozen or so times in the last 2 years.  

We've always been promptly seated, even yesterday, when we needed a table for 9 and all of them were seemingly taken or reserved.  The service is just as friendly once you're seated.

Their menu has some great variety - salads, sandwiches, and southwestern flavored entrees.  My favorites are the flat iron steak salad (steak, avocado, sprouts, and potatoes over greens) and the vegetarian tamale.  The guys that I eat with rave about the tuna salad.  One bummer is that the lemonade isn't fresh (it's powdered).  You can't really taste it in the AP's, but you can when you're drinking straight lemonade.

The view from the patio is nice, even for a non-golfer like myself, so if they offer to seat you out there, I recommend it.

#Yelp365 - 168/365"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of this course. It's more of a 2.5 star rating since the course is always overpriced too.

I just don't get the love affair people have with the course. I guess it's the home course love Sun Devils give this place. I've played it several times and the course conditions have been average at best. I really don't find too many of the holes memorable and it's fairly boring for the most part.

They do have some good beers on tap and the pro shop is one of the better ones around in regards to the apparel and such they have available.

I'd like Karsten more if the rates were more reasonable, but with such high prices, I'd rather go to a more affordable and just as enjoyable course nearby."}
{"text":"Worst golf course I've played in Arizona! Paid 36 dollars to play 18 holes...fairways are not taken care of they are the same length as the rough. Greens were burnt out already and as long as the fringe, had hit every putt like it was 100ft away.  Don't waste your money, let this dump of a course close down. On its best day I highly doubt it's worth the money to play.  I feel bad for the people that pay full price to play. Once again this course is complete garbage, stay away!"}
{"text":"I only golfed the front 9, but even with it raining everyday this week, the course was in great condition. The staff was very friendly as well. At a few points, the cart path was covered in mud and 6in deep puddles. Play was a little delayed, but our tee time was spot on. We also scheduled last minute and we're accommodated."}
{"text":"Played here for the first time today, I can honestly say this was the most enjoyable round of golf I have ever played. The staff was extremely nice and helpful. I felt as if the course was fair as far as difficulty goes, then becomes more and more difficult the further into the round I got. The course made me make decisions on how to play my tee shots, (whether to lay up, go around one of probably 1000 bunkers, or avoid the hills and moguls) which was a nice change of pace from other courses. Played during the week so it wasn't terribly busy, but was held up by 2 separate groups of 2 who would not let me play through until about the 15 hole. This got so bad the group of 2 behind me skipped 4 holes to jump in front of the 2 groups. But pace of play still wasn't terrible, took about 4 hours to finish. 10/10 would golf again"}
{"text":"Ack! Another local secret that hasn't already been Yelped! 

This place rules. I guess you'd get more excited about it if, like me, you're an ASU Sun Devil. This is because your walk from the clubhouse entrance to the restaurant takes you through an ASU souvenir/golf shop where your senses are basically drowned in visual displays of gold, maroon and images of Sparky. If you're not a Sun Devil, don't be annoyed... you are on sovereign ASU territory after all. This is the course where our top golf alumnus, Phil Mickelson, was trained as he burst into the national spotlight by winning his first national championship as a scrawny freshman. And of course if you're a Wildcat, I'd suggest wearing camouflage if you dare step inside. (Just kidding. Some of my Wildcat buddies love coming here to both golf and eat). 

The five stars are deserved regardless of your collegiate loyalty or even your interest in golf. Golf courses tend to be very pretty, needless to say. And the restaurant directly overlooks the course. The backdrop to your meal consists of relaxing, softly rolling green hills. You don't have to be a golfer to appreciate that. In the winter the massive outdoor patio is open, where the views (of the 9th and 18th holes) are even more spectacular. 

Other than Four Peaks, this is the top choice for informal mini-reunions with me and my old ASU law buddies. The food isn't necessarily spectacular, but it is good. The selection is Southwestern-influenced American. Despite the elegant feel to the place, their entrees are often priced between the 8 to 12 dollar range. 

And seriously, out of the 4 of us Sun Devils who meet here regularly, only one is a golfer (so he claims, anyway). We come here for the good food, great views, and relaxing atmosphere right in the middle of one of Tempe's busiest areas.

(A warning: I've only come here for lunch and their website doesn't clearly indicate that it's open for dinner.)"}
{"text":"Nice course.  I got on for around $100, which I don't think is too much for a nice course.  Includes range balls and a cart.

Course is in very good shape, greens roll true, a nice test of golf without being too difficult.  Pretty straight forward - what you see is what you get.  Pace of play was about 4.5 hours, waited on each hole but not very long and not to the point where it was annoying.  

Beautiful 9th and 18th holes going along a big pond which splits the two holes and makes each tough.  ASU stadium is in the background on each hole and adds to the scene."}
{"text":"This Pete Dye course is in great shape and very challenging.  Derek Crawford does an amazing job of always making it a world class experience.  If you have never played here, you need to come out and try it.  Don't be afraid to play some tees conservative with an iron if you want to score.  If you are in the bar/restaurant, ask Aaron to make you something interesting to drink.  He is the man!   If Monica is not  on the cart, you will be taken care of and I would recommend the Bloody Mary.  Colin, Joey and Ryan are pretty much running the proshop and never skip a beat with service.  You must try this course!  You will thank Pete for his design after you finish and you are licking your wounds."}
{"text":"Had an event there this weekend. 50 people on the patio. Great service and food and a very reasonable price for a big party.  We had a barbecue buffet lunch with open bar. Hunter attended to every detail and really helped make it a success. From everyone I have talked to, I made a great choice. It was fun! Thank you, Karsten."}
{"text":"If your coming out here in March don't bother waisting your time. Backed up 2-3 groups on each hole with a $115 price tag. 6 hour round minimum..."}
{"text":"If you want to play a decent course DO NOT BOOK HERE course is in terrible shape. Just played a couple of weeks ago the greens were all but dead and fairways not much better.  They should post these facts on their web site or let you know when you call in."}
{"text":"I have been to this course a few different times.  The summer deals brought me in because it is a little pricey during the season.  

The greens and fairways have always been in good condition and I enjoy the challenging hills and strategically placed bunkers.  I haven't really scored well on this course but as a beginner golfer I enjoy the challenge this course offers. 

Water jugs on every tee is crucial for the summer months."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a round of golf with good friends. The course was in great shape but after, we stopped in the Trophy Room for lunch. They have the best burgers in town.

I had the American Angus Burger with applewood smoked bacon. YUMMY!! All my other friends had the Albacore Tuna Salad, Southwest Burger and BBQ Beef.  All agreed it was a great lunch. No disappointments here.

Waitress was awesome, friendly and knowledgeable. Kept our water glasses full. 
Place was busy because of people registering for their tournament and the lunch crowd.

We'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"This is a great Pete Dye course... the front doesn't have a par 5 and the course is a par 70, however it is challenging and very fun! 

The pro shop constantly running different offers and opportunities, so join their email list! ASU students and locals get a discounted rate as well.

Great place to find lots of ASU apparel, they have hats, polo, jackets, t shirts, golf gear etc... will miss this as ASU's Home course."}
{"text":"My alma mater...my home course.  Karsten golf course at ASU is classic Pete Dye.  Large swails, pot bunkers, #16 par 3 that flirts water.  I put a 4 iron from 220 2\" from teh cup...big woop...I did it in a dust storm!!!! -- ask StoizzoF about that one.  The best thing about this course is that students get to play for cheap.  The clubhouse was designed by local architect Eddie Jones and compliments the golf course perfectly.  Dye did a great job in hiding the not so fantastic sights aroudn teh golf course but over the years I got used to the power plant, power lines, and ghetto east side along McClintock.  If your on vacation you need to play the course in whcih Phil Mick perfected his game and if you're a student you need to play this course.  Devils, Devils, Devils!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't actually played here, but I've used the practice range many a time.  The staff is always friendly and the practice facility is amazing if not a bit overpriced.  It's a great place to work on your game."}
{"text":"Slowly becoming my home course since moving to Tempe! Practice facilities are great to tune up your game and the course is always maintained well. If you get a chance to play it mid week go for it. Having this course to yourself is a treat! Staff is friendly and welcoming both in the shop and out on the course. Only criticism is that it can be a little pricey for the green fees but its worth it. What isnt worth it is the price for a bag of range balls!"}
{"text":"Five stars for quality, green maintenance, hidden driving range and overall course design.  As far as the club house, I would say the kids there seem to be some problems.  

Summer time,
Best Wednesday Special $17.50 with cart! Wow.  
Clothing required, Collared shirt and pants, or khaki shorts.  Even for the driving range.  I was asked to put on a collared shirt  for the range, I had one but got the hint that I was not welcomed.  If your read this far I ask you to help save Karstin Golf Course."}
{"text":"Just played this course today. Had a hard time reading the greens but they did roll true. Course was in very good condition. Risk/reward is worth it if you're hitting the ball well. They place bunkers the right places so  beware. Not a lot of blind shots so local knowledge is not needed. The staff were nice and friendly. The only thing I could complain about were the foursome ahead of us. They (4 middle aged men) were playing from the championship tees but we're not hitting the ball well. No one in front of them but we were always waiting. Didn't see any rangers to help them along. Hey, if you can't hit your driver over 200 yards, then I suggest you hit from another tee box. Overall, I would play this course again."}
{"text":"Fantastic summer pricing for a varied and challenging course.  Let's start from the top.

Plenty of space in the parking lot and bag drop area.  Pro shop has a great variety of gear and apparel, and all the ASU golf paraphanelia you could ever want.  The guys in the pro shop/clubhouse are also very friendly and will help you along your way if you haven't played at this course before. 

As for the course itself - I played in the middle of August so it was pretty darn hot - it is a gorgeous course that is extremely well maintained considering the heat of the summer.  Great bunker placement and stretches of water that add challenge and variety to your straight-then-dog-eared hole.  Scenery isn't much to look at, but who's griping when you can play year round?  Price-wise, I paid $30 for a full round and I believe that was a summer discount.  Not sure what their peak season price point is.  

Be warned that if you haven't been to this course before that the cart path can get a bit confusing at times, and watch out for the 9th/18th, as they tee off from the same general area but two different tees.  Wouldn't want anyone getting hit in the noggin. 

If you have an early tee time you can pop into the clubhouse for some lunch and cold beer afterwards.  The food is pretty good (but honestly after a round of 18 anything's goods), and there's probably fewer things in life that make me happier than drinking a cold draft from an ice cold mug that you can actually see vapor swirls coming off of, after a long round of golf!!

Overall, a great golfing experience from start to finish.  I think that anyone would enjoy this, from beginners all the way to amateurs."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my round here... Solid pro shop.. Nice range.. Good carts...

This course started out pretty easy and then got difficult.. There is water, trees, hills, and bunkers....

I would play here again.."}
{"text":"As far as university courses go, ASU's Karsten is a tough one to beat (though understandable given ASU's golf program over the years).

From the pro shop, to the restaurant, down to the service and the course itself; there's really nothing about Karsten that makes you feel like you're on a university course (save the trophy case and noticeable ASU logos everywhere). The course is well maintained, professionally run and the staff are very friendly.

I was able to take advantage of the unlimited golf deal, which was reasonably priced and allowed me to get in 36 holes in mid-January (which also included lunch within the price). Certainly a course I'd return to."}
{"text":"Great Pete Dye design. One of a kind in the valley. Why does it have to go away?
Better play it now. This will be gone in 3 years. ASU wants to make a parking lot for there football stadium in the future. What a crock!!!
This by far the worst decision ever by ASU. That's saying something.
I am officially tossing my golf bag in the lake when they close.
Why o why ??"}
