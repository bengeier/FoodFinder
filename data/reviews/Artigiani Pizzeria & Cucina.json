{"text":"Excellent! Authentic! Pizza and pasta were terrific made from scratch and thoroughly enjoyed by all. Pizza is large portion ."}
{"text":"I have spent a lot of time researching pizzerias in Montreal... reading reviews, going to recommended places.... but so far, the pizza here is by far one of the best in Montreal.  The atmosphere is very welcoming, staff friendly and efficient- there is a lovely selection of wines, sometimes with incredibly good buys with their private imports...  All around I love this place and would say truly, one of the best Neapolitan style pizzas in the city.  Highly recommend.

Now.... if only they had an appetizer of fresh mozzarella.........."}
{"text":"Je suis allée dans ce restaurant pour une pizza à emporter ... 
La personne l'ayant reçu n'a franchement pas était courtoise. 
Et il n'y avait rien sur ma pizza. 
Decue :("}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night. The ambiance was really nice, the restaurant was full but not too loud, and the service was good and fast. We had the Artigiani pizza and goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes focaccia, both delicious. Their arancini is a must. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Prices are reasonable and the restaurant's interior was really nice. The service was good as well."}
{"text":"An excellent pizzeria with good food, great service and a casual warm an inviting ambience.  Tried both the prosciutto/goat cheese pizza and shrimp pasta dishes.  Both were very good, no mistaking that wood fired pizza taste! Bottle of Tertium Cantina wine was very nice and complimented both dishes well. Finished off with a very good Tiramisu.  
Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"To rate and review restaurants, we tend to only focus on the food quality rather than the ambiance. We ordered an entree and three main dishes for sharing. 
Bread : cold and chewy. They should be heated in the oven before serving. 
Polpette Di Vittelo (veal meatballs): slightly dry. The dish should contain more tomato sauce for dipping. 
Quattro fromaggi pizza: the crust was thin and not crispy enough. When served on the table, the bottom parts of this pizza became wet, soft and slightly soggy. 
Tagliatelle Al Funghi:  pasta has a fully al dante texture. Very fresh. The portion was smaller than expected. we were satisfied with the dish in general. 
Gnocchi Al Pomodoro: No comment on this dish as i had no previous experience on this type of pasta. But I personally would order another dish if we visit again. 
Finally we ordered a gelato tarfuto amaretto for our friend whose birthday will occur 4 days later."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in my last experience at artigiani...we used to love the pizza but now this is a different story. 
The \"fresh mozzarella\" in la Vera pizza was rubbery and plastic like which ruined the whole taste of the pizza. There was nothing fresh nor moist about it. 
Seems like they are trying to cut down on costs and feed us cheap quality ingredients. 
The waiter did not even know how to explain what was capicollo and sopressetta....I'm sorry but \" it's Italian\" does not cut it...
What a shame!
Will not be back."}
{"text":"Great, great, great pizza. I had the traditional tomato, basil, red sauce & I added goat cheese. Only got 4 stars because the service was a little lacking (the tables around us received way more attention.) but the food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Found this little place by accident and wow was I impressed!!!!!! Absolutely delicious pizza! Everything made fresh to order and the atmosphere is romantic yet inviting for anyone! I'm from the North End of Boston and we pride ourselves  in our pizza so trust me when I say this place is delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Délicieuse pizzas 
Mention spéciale pour la pizza artigiani!
Grand choix de vin
Tres bonne soirée"}
{"text":"Really good place! We came in for a light dinner and shared a pizza and a pasta. The pizza was very thin, except the crust. The tomato sauce, complemented by the fresh mozzarella and basil, was fantastic. A previous review complained about the quality of the fresh mozzarella, but in my opinion this is not an issue (it might have been, but it was probably rectified following that review). The pasta fresco with white sauce and mushrooms was nice as well. The desserts were very decently priced and tasty - we had the affogato which was rich and creamy and the cannoli which was just like in Sicily! Service was fantastic. We will probably go back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I recently went to this restaurant with a group of friends as I had heard so many positive reviews and must say Artigiani definately lived up to expectations. This resto serves up one  of the best wood oven pizza's in montreal.Their  pizza is thin crust  and  they a have wide variety of pizza's that will please your pallette.  Ambiance is cozy and modern decor. They also serve up a great seafood pasta dish for all you seafood lovers and must not forget to mention their fried calamari entree. Lastly, be sure to leave room for their wonderful tiramisu dessert served in a gelato glass. Would definately recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience and decor. Food was good. We tried a couple of their pasta dishes (Fusilli Artigiani and Rigatoni with sausage) and both were good as was the Pizza Quattro Formaggi. It had a nice thin crust. The portions were perfect.
The pear and cheese salad was good except for the 
walnuts that tasted rather old. The only other 'negative' was that the bread was brought out just before the food, it was cold and the spicy oil was brought out well after the bread had been eaten..poor timing on the server's part.  The restaurant was rather busy and perhaps it was just an 'off' night.  I will recommend this restaurant to friends that will be in town soon."}
{"text":"WOW !!
C'est un collègue qui nous a dit que c'était \"son\" resto. Du coup, on s'est dit que ça devait valoir le coup... ben on n'a pas été déçu !!

Outre le cadre sympa, les serveurs sont accueillants et la nourriture... miam !
Entrée, boulettes de viandes et une spécialité au riz et fromage, le tout frit... une découverte !!
Plats, pizzas bien évidemment ! Une roquette et prosciutto, et une Giardino (légumes et fromages)... elles sont à tomber !!! Cuites au feu de bois, et vraiment très TRES goutues !
Quant aux quantités... dès l'entrée on commençait à être calés ! On est reparti avec 1/2 pizza de chaque dans une box, pour le lunch du lendemain :)

Conclusion : dommage qu'ils ne fassent pas au moins à emporter ! Mais on se re déplacera sans soucis !!!"}
{"text":"My family of 4's first night in Montreal and Artigiani was nearby from our rental residence. We started with the arancini and meatballs, both good. Onto dinner, where we were thinking of pizza, but decided on the pasta meals (gnocchis, rigatoni and 2 orders of the rotinis). Nice, Northern Italian-like meals. All were very good and reminded us of several similar restaurants in the North End of Boston. Small but good selection of wine. And zeppoles for dessert that the kids fought over. Would definitely go back when we're back in the Plateau neighborhood again."}
{"text":"Très bon resto de quartier, allez y avec confiance!"}
{"text":"My brother had his graduation dinner here in addition to us frequenting Artigiania many times during our university years in Montreal.

The owner is very intelligent and knowledgable about authentic Italian cuisine.

The wood fired Neopolitan pizza is delicious in addition to the pastas. The strength of this restaurant is in the desserts specifically the zeppole fritte."}
{"text":"Wow, the pizza here is incredible - probably the best I've ever had, and I've eaten pizza all over the world!  My husband who never orders pizza when we go out, did here when he saw the pizzas coming out of the kitchen.  Endive salad was amazing, service was fantastic, will definitely return when I'm back in MTL!  And yes - try the zeppole, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service is polite and prompt. Pizza was only so-so, to be honest: it wasn't bad, but the dough was somewhat soggy and the olives made it very salty.  (I got the Caruso, with sausage, mushroom, and olive.) Dining room was pleasant, but the open kitchen made things a bit clattery."}
{"text":"Nice Italian right in the heart of Plateau. Pizza from a wood burning oven simply fantastic. Ingredients are all extra fresh and delightful service. Anyone looking for authentic Italian in plateau - look no further !"}
{"text":"I bought a coupon on Groupon and had zero expectations. I walked in and the place was empty and I told my boyfriend \"this should be interesting\". Man was I wrong.... I even decided to ADD the business on Yelp for how fantastic it was!!! It was worth every single bite. We started off with fried calamari and grilled garlic shrimp. Super tasty and fresh; almost melts in your mouth. The main dish was a four cheese thin crust pizza and my boyfriend had the \"all dressed\" pizza. Omg! That's all I will say. The tomato sauce was extremely fresh, the ingredients were \"garden fresh\". Finally, dessert. I'm not a dessert person. At all. I would go back FOR the dessert. The Zeppolli's tasted as though my Grandma made them. Omg food-gasm!!! I'm so glad I bought this Groupon coupon and discovered this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"We visited Montreal for the week and were craving pasta, so we found this place online. It had pretty good reviews and the pasta looked delish so we checked it out. We both has very good pasta bowls (the spaghetti and the tagliatelle - highly recommend both) and a nice bottle of Rosé. The atmosphere was very warm and friendly, good ambiance. We were very comfortable and thoroughly enjoyed our experience there. After dinner I ordered tea and my boyfriend ordered a coffee - unfortunately the coffee was just about the worst both of us had ever tasted! It was luke warm, and tasted like it had been sitting in the bottom of the pot for hours! This is the only bad thing I have to say about the place - and it could have just been old/end of the day coffee. Other than that - great place! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We needed to find a place on Saturday to eat as it was our last night in Montreal and we knew that we wanted to eat early.  Me forgetting to make a reservation earlier in the day didn't help.  We were able to get a last minute reservation at Argitiani's as long as we were in by 6 and finished by 7:45, which was great as I had a taste for Italian.   Now on to the food.  The food was a 4 start for sure, the portion is what caused me to rate this place a 3 star.  We ordered an appetizer of Calamri which was perfectly cooked but the portion could have served maybe 1.5 people vs. the three of us.  Immediately my husband said, \"I am glad I am not too hungry if this is an indication of their portions.\"  Well, he order the ravioli, I ordered the shrimp with pasta and our daughter went for her usual, pizza.  The shrimp with pasta was excellent.  The homemade pasta was al dente and the shrimp was tender, juicy, and very flavorful.  I did finish the entire dish.  Earlton's dish was more the size of a decent appetizer and indeed he finished it as well as half of Kendal's pizza.  The marinara sauce was well seasoned and the ricotta and spinach stuffing was quite tasty.  We followed it up with two dessert selections, the chocolate gelato and the beignet with honey and ricotta cream.  Absolutely delightful!!  Would go back if I were not super hungry and wanted really tasty italian for sure.  Otherwise, would seek another italian restarurant option in Montreal."}
{"text":"Not my favourite restaurant in Montreal, but it's about as reliable as they come. With consistently cooked pastas and pizzas, there's virtually no way that you'll leave unsatisfied. That said, if you plan on ordering pasta, you should probably order an appetizer as well, as I found the pasta bowls slightly less filling. This, however, coming from someone who inhaled one of their pizzas in 15 minutes, so take that advice for what it's worth. 

Bonus points for gluten free pasta options, lovely atmosphere and an incredibly friendly staff"}
{"text":"Was craving pizzas since arriving to Montreal but didn't feel like going to Little Italy. I'm so happy to find this place, and the pizzas seem quite close to restaurants in Europe.

Delicious!!! The pizzas are really good! They are about $17-19 each, and the restaurant offers a lot of choices. They also made their own delicious spicy olive oil, which I poured on every bite.

The restaurant is dark and can get busy. And loud! It feels like everything echoes! The tables for two are very tiny. 

There is a TV at the bar, where the entrance is. I think the vibe isn't romantic or classy as they want it to be, but the food was goooood."}
{"text":"Here's a breakdown of the meal my family and I had:

Beer on tap: good
Arancini: good
Calamari: very average, chewy

Now for the pizza... 
Crust: way too thin, burnt in some places, tasted too much of flour
Pizza toppings: very few, some tasty, some not so much

After receiving our beers, arancino and calamari, we each received our pizza. As we were eating, we noticed our pizzas were thin - very thin! The sauce and toppings caused the pizza to become very soggy. But for my dad who didn't have any sauce nor \"heavy\" toppings (only a few cherry tomatoes, goat cheese, arugula and proscuito), his pizza had the opposite effect; it was burnt in parts on top and underneath. We showed the waiter and asked him if he could change my dad's pizza. He returned with a second pizza but this time, it was undercooked. He showed the waiter again who completely agreed with us and brought us another pizza. By that time, we were all done eating and although my dad found his pizza to be burnt again (this time there was even a hole in it due to how thin it was), but my dad gave up and ended up eating it anyway.

The service: Upon our arrival the owner or manager was very nice, accommodated us outside on his terrace although we were previously sitting inside. Our waiter was very friendly and made sure we got our food fast. However, our biggest disappointment came from the owner who, after seeing a pizza was returned twice, hid inside the restaurant and never came back out. Not once did he come outside and apologize, to see if the pizza was to our liking, or even offer us any anything else. Not even coffee on the house. I mean, come on?! After spending $165 in his restaurant, the least he could have done is to come and see us before we leave to thank us for coming to his restaurant. As we were driving in front of the restaurant a few minutes later, we even saw him sitting on the terrace. That to me shows a complete lack of respect for his customers. He was willing to greed us and welcome us upon our arrival but couldn't care less once we had issues with our order. 

Over the past few years, I have been to Artigiani at least 5 times, recommended this restaurant to countless of people, including friends and colleagues of mine, but after our experience last week, I don't think I will."}
{"text":"We ate here after buying a Groupon-
It included two appetizers two entrées and a dessert.  
We started off with calamari and the mozzarella salad- both were very good and I'm Italian and lives in New York City and it was quite good. 
The mushroom pasta with tagliatelle was also excellent and the pasta was fresh.  
The white pizza was well-made cook well and covered with a ruler and it also was good.  
The service was a little slow but the waitress was very helpful- and she did have other tables. 
One very loud group of eight or 10 people with children.   Very loud very obnoxious and they caused us to pack up our meal and leave early.   We wanted to have quite a conversation but that wasn't going to happen. 
I looked at the wine list and they had a few good wines at reasonable cost.  
I would recommend going if you get a discount or Groupon.-
However be warned in advance this is more pizzeria than Italian restaurant.  There was zero selection of chicken there was no source of protein on the menu at all it was all carbohydrates or pasta or pizza.  
That being said if you enjoy eating a lot of white flour with good sauces on it you will enjoy your meal here."}
