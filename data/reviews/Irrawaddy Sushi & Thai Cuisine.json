{"text":"I THINK THEY RE-USE THEIR RICE !!!  yikes!!  i got take-out & when i got home about a half hour later & looked at the rice container, it wasn't \"gelled\" together as a fresh batch of rice *always* is (i've ordered asian food for 30 years so i know what rice in a container looks like .. this was the 1st time i've ever seen rice that looked like it was gathered from multiple plates).  there was also some STAINED rice (very little, but it existed) in the clumps of rice which makes me think that they got it off of someone else's used plate who didn't eat all of their rice & some of their sauce was on it.  i don't care that the rice was \"uncle ben's quality\" (not jasmine or basmati) but i do care if they are using left-over rice off of someone's plate.  i would call the Department of Health but have no proof (other than i've been eating thai, chinese, japanese, for over 30 years).  the fact that they seem to be using rice from left-over plates is D.I.S.G.U.S.T.I.N.G !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went in today for lunch and was the only person in the restaurant around 2:30 pm.  Since it was post lunch during the holidays I wasn't too surprised to see the place empty.  I approached the gentleman at the register to place a takeout order.  I ordered Pad Thai Spicy 5 and it was finished within 10 minutes which was nice.  I took it back to my office to eat it and it was good, but not spicy at all.  The gentleman working even asked if I'd like it extra spicy and I agreed.  This was disappointing as there was no spice to my pad thai at all.  Since it was only their second day open it could have been an error.  I am willing to try it again.  The restaurant was very clean and the man working was very nice."}
{"text":"I love spicy food, but the Penang curry was too spicy that even eating it with white rice wasn't enough. The chicken spicy basil fried rice was flavorful. The Thai iced tea was the right amount of sweet."}
{"text":"Average Thai restaurant with speedy service and friendly staff. Good for lunch take out if in a hurry."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was very pleased with the Pho and I was very pleased with the Tom Yum. The Bubble Tea was on point.  We did pick up and, though the restaurant was empty, (indicative of most restaurants as a bad sign) it was still good service and good food."}
{"text":"I have a $15 certificate and willing to have this new place a try. The waiter was nice and polite. But he didn't took the appetizer plate and soup bowl away even after we push them to the side of the table and had tissue in there. However, he did refill our bubble tea with no charge.  For the taste. They definitely need to do better than these. We had padkeemao and another noodle with soup(I forgot the name). First of all, the noodle was a little bit undercooked. Then the beef didn't taste very good. And for a level 2 spicy, it was too much( I usually eat medium spicy).  The goyoza was pretty good, I'd have that 5starts. Tom yum soup was fine too, but how can you go wrong with soup?  Over all, this place is alright, but there are way too much other better options downtown for lunch."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. It was busy but not to the point where our food took forever to arrive - we almost had to get our food to go because we had meetings to they back to. Pad Thai was sweet. Spice levels are weak. It's just meh. A lot nicer on the inside than you'd think from the exterior."}
{"text":"I would definitely not reccomend thier bubble tea / boba tea. Poor service by employees and poor quality. I was greeted at the door of what looked like a more restaurant style type of place and asked if I could just order boba or bubble tea to go and he says \"we don't have that\" what kind of person doesn't know thier own menu? I proceeded to show him the menu where they have it, so he asks what kind I want, I tell him chocolate. \"Oh we don't have chocolate\", again point it out to where it says they do on the menu. So he starts putting my order into the register (the total is $4.50) and I hand him my card, and he informs me that there is a minimum payment of $5 on cards. So I look at the menu and just decide to get a second drink (I'm not a big Thai food person but I love boba and bubble tea, I specifically came here for just that). I pay and then sit down at the bar area to wait for the drinks. I wait about 5 or so minutes and my drinks and head out. It wasn't until I tried the drinks that I realized I would not be making a second appearance. It was blended with ice (which wasn't blended finely enough) and the milk tea is not like most places I had been to. Then I tried the bubbles and that was the worst part. There was something very wrong with them because when you chewed into them it was a somewhat chalky consistency and definitely not chewy like most boba I have had before. I tried to tell if it was intentional and tried more bubbles but it just was so bad that I ended up throwing them both away. Waste of money and all around bad experience. Don't get me wrong, the staff was perfectly nice, but just unhappy with my purchase."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today for the first time. Not good. I was hoping this would better in order to save some walking when I needed a Thai food fix,  but looks like I'll be walking further to Nicky's or Siam.   The prices were reasonable, lunch crowd is sparse (at least before noon), and the place looks nice.   The places purely loses points for the food and that is what matters most. They start you with an egg drop soup or an iceberg salad with some sort of spicy mayo salad dressing. Neither sound traditional to me. I got the salad and it was OK. Next, I went for the Pad Thai with a spice level 4 (scale is 1-5). It was somewhat familiar to what I consider Pad Thai, but the flavor seemed a little weak, it was a bit dry, and it was lacking the abundance of toppings I am used to from other local favorites. Also, the spice level wasn't quite hot enough for me, but I'm sure I could've ask for some extra spice if I wanted, but it wasn't a huge concern to me. If the price was better, I'd be more ok with these things, but it is the same as the aforementioned, better Thai restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"1st timer and the place was completely empty. Tried the green curry noodles and a side of fried rice. The portions were health and both dishes were outstanding. More food than I could eat! I have no clue why I was the only one in the resturant as this place was awesome!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, my experience was different. I've been here a few times and I've never been disappointed.  I ordered Chicken Satay as my appetizer. The chicken was well-seasoned. Then I chose Pad Woonsen with pork for my entree. The portion was perfect and also the spiciness.   The service was fast. The waitresses are very friendly and attentive.  This restaurant will be my favorite Asian restaurant in Downtown."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Irrawaddy's for lunch today and I had a much different experience than Praveen.  I got greeted quickly by a cheerful hostess, got seated and my order was taken relatively quickly. I choose the Mongolian Beef (3 out of 5 on the spice level) and I had a choice of egg drop soup or salad to start with; I choose the salad which was slightly bigger than what I've gotten at Nicky Thai's. It came with lettuce, red cabbage, tomato and carrots. The dressing was sweet creamy.  It took less than 10 minutes for my Mongolian Beef to be served. The beef was well done, as I had requested, and it was mixed with tomato, scallions, carrots and sliced peppers in a tangy brown sauce with a mound of white rice on the side. Delicious! My only complaint is that I thought the serving portion was a bit on the slight side. I didn't walk away hungry but I would have welcomed more.  Nicky Thai's is still the golden standard, as far as I'm concerned, for Thai food in the Burgh. But Irrawaddy's, with their varied menu (to include sushi), is a nice change of pace. I'm sure that I'll be back.  Total bill for lunch (excluding tip) was $9.00."}
{"text":"Despite the bad reviews, I decided to give the underdog a chance - BIG mistake. Friday evening and the place was dead. The restaurant is not as shady as its exterior might suggest, and we were pleased with the quality of service provided by our waitress. Unfortunately that's where the positives end.   Irrawaddy managed to utterly fail at three different types of cuisine all within one meal - quite the feat. The menu has Thai, Japanese, and Vietnamese options; however, it's clear that they have absolutely no clue what they're doing for any of these dishes. I started with the vegan delight roll which was odd, to say the least. Never have I seen red bell peppers or shredded carrots in a sushi roll. The different vegetables didn't complement each other well, so overall, it was unappetizing. The Thai Fried Rice was so bland and tasteless that I poured half a bottle of soy sauce into my dish just to make it taste less like cardboard. The tofu was dry and shriveled that it was borderline disgusting. My boyfriend decided to order the pho (what a bold man). Their \"pho\" was a dirty, filthy lie. The taste was awful, there was no hoisin sauce (they didn't even know what hoisin sauce is! what?!), and from the photo, you can see it was 90% broth. Being Vietnamese, I'm offended that they dragged our signature dish through the dirt.   For the love of God and your taste buds, just do not eat here!"}
{"text":"The service is terribly slower than a snail. Been close to 30 mins and the only thing we have on our table a glass of water and empty salad bowls. It took 10 mins to even order our food. The waitresses are all new and don't have a clue on what's on the menu. Will update the review once we have our food!  UPDATE: After waiting for almost 75 mins, we had to come out. There was no point in waiting there for the food. The restaurant was hardly packed and the cook has not even started on our order. Pathetic service. I wish I could give no stars at all."}
