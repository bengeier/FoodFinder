{"text":"This is the cleanest restaurant I ever ate in. Their breakfast is so fresh and very tasty. Prices are more than reasonable. Service is friendly & fast. Can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"I am not an interior decorator so I'm going skip the shortcomings of the restaurants design, feng shui, I need a place to have Ikea furniture for me to enjoy a meal there, and talk about the omelette.  Mel's Omelette is delicious.  It must have an entire block of cheese in it, plus you get hash browns (Those are covered in cheese), and it's filled with breakfast meats.  The amount of cheese is just unreal.  I love cheese!  So in turn I love Mel's Omelette.  Oh yeah, and you get toast."}
{"text":"I should have known better.  I LOVE these old-school diners, but every time one of them hangs a sign bragging about how good they are (Best Diner In Phoenix), it disappoints me.  My wife and I went for lunch and ordered hamburgers, fries, and cokes.  Simple, right?  Both burgers were charred too much and tasted like they were burnt.  The fries were cold and our service was absolutely horrible!  We had this waitress who looked to be in her late 40's, early 50's and she was SLOW!  Anyway, as the rating guide suggests, \"Meh, I've had better, much better\"."}
{"text":"I can't really say anything about the food as I've never eaten it.  This would be for the following reason.

Let me begin by saying, I love local owned business. I would rather spend my money there than a chain any given chance I have. 

 I work on Bell Road and get my breakfast every Saturday morning from the Denny's at the I-17 and Bell on my way into work.  I noticed Fast Eddies a few months ago and thought to try them.  So as I was leaving for work I called in an order and a half hour later showed up to pick up my food.  Needless to say it wasn't ready.  Not only was it not ready nobody knew anything about my order.  Well I didn't factor in the huge difficulties of writing down an order into my morning commute so I didn't have time to wait.  I was amazed at how used to this kind of thing the entire staff seemed.  They all were kind of like \"ah well, shucks, maybe next time.... see ya.\"

Soooo fast forward to today 04/23/2011.  I'm leaving my house for work and I think to myself \"They can't screw it up twice...I need to give 'em another shot\"  So I did.  WHOOPS!  It was just like last time.  It played out precisely the same.  However this time I factored in the error to be made and promptly went to Denny's and waited for my food.

So yeah, I can't say anything about their food, but I can't see where it would be worth the gamble of being pissed off due to such awful service.  And then further angered when they just don't care that you're not getting the service that comes with say.... a business."}
{"text":"Okay so most the time I'm really patient about waiting and understanding of things taking longer then usually but the wait was ridiculous. We got there sat down for like 10 seconds and was ask what i wanted to drink, remind you I haven't even looked at the menu yet :/ After about 5 mins we got our drinks and took about maybe 10mins to decide what we wanted to eat. When we ordered it took literally like 45mins to get our food, in the mean time we were not asked if we would like a refill on our drink or if we were okay, and sorry about the wait. 45 mins later we finally got our food, which my husband and I felt bad about because there was another coupke with kids there before us that still didn't have there food yet. Finally after about 10 mins the other couple and there kids got there food remind you they had ordered pancakes, i mean anyone knows pancake do NOT take that long to make. After we got our food and another refill we were asked about ice cream, we never asked for it but I guess it's included in every meal which would of been great if my daughter would have been with us. My husband was pretty excited to come here since it was his first time and he flat out won't ever go again. We waited forever, our server was not what we would expect, and the food is just not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Are meal took along time and when it finally came they got are order wrong and acted like it was are fault. And the cheeses burgers we ordered were bland and nothing special. I dont think I would have a reason to go back."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yummy.  You'll want to check these folks out!  They have been on Groupon a few times and you get lots of food for the money.  Really, if there were such a thing as a 'to go' bag for breakfast, you'll need it.  Great tasting skillets, wonderful hamburgers and a genuinely friendly, helpful staff. They made us feel at home and that's every time (have been there three times) we've gone.  They don't get upset about Groupon and stop to chat if you're willing.  This place reminds me of what diners used to be.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Ok people this place is just like any other sit down breakfast place in Phoenix crispy scramble eggs gross very grey gravy look like grey water and they wanted me to pay for this and eat this I'm sorry but eggs should be fluffy not crispy with a burnt layer on them lazy gravy should be white it's country gravy wife got country potatoes that were deep fried hard as a rock her eggs were burnt too you want a good breakfast cook it at home don't waste your money by coming here"}
{"text":"I tried this place and never again will I waste my time and money.Service beyond slow and food was poorly cooked and tasteless.Went to restroom while waiting for food and should have left when I saw the filthy condition it was in. Server kept wiping her nose on her arm and sniffing, couldn't tell if on crack or sick so called the health department ."}
{"text":"Very good homestyle cooking. The Fish and Chips are fresh every Friday and are second to none in Phoenix.

Place has a dive feel to it, but that is the charm of it. Anyone who expects classic dining should not eat here. You get a good meal at a decent price. Servers always polite, and meals come very quickly."}
{"text":"Value, Fun, Friendly and a Little Kitchy...but in a good way!
The hostess was friendly and fast, she seated us right away and got us menus & beverages.  And the good service continued with our waitress who took the time to explain menu items, kept us in beverages, condiments and ensured we were satisfied with our order.  Now onto the food, we had breakfast.  The value can't be beat.  We had a wide variety, from pancakes to Tex-Mex and it was all delish.  

Plenty of free parking, clean bathrooms and a fun wall of photos, signs and eclectic decor. The entire experience was fun and festive!  What a great way to start the day!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and seated us right away. Waitresses were very attentive and continued to ask if we needed anything. One waitress actually told me about a cheaper meal with more food. The place has a nice feel to it and all the memorabilia on the walls is interesting. They give you very generous portions and the meal was ready very quickly. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This place is so needed.  Great prices, quick service and large portions.  Biscuits and gravy for $3.75 and a special 2 egg, 2 bacon and 2 pancakes for $2.95.  Hell yes."}
{"text":"Good food. Fast service. Great prices. The servers could be a little more polite, but will for sure return."}
{"text":"Reminds me of my days in Upstate NY. Greasy spoon at it's best. $3.99 breakfast every day. Can't beat it. Promo in month of June has six random days offering free breakfast. I know. I was there on Friday and that was one of the days. Make sure you get there before end of the month. Great neighborhood place. Nostalgic decor. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Fast Eddies is the type of place you go to when you're not in a hurry. It's clean, well lit and the service is excellent. We've had several different wait staff and they are all proficient. Dana seems like the most proficient as she remembers our drink orders from week to week and we see refills magically appear. I've never been to Fast Eddies for breakfast. My friends have and I hear only good things.
I have a severe peppercorn allergy and they do a super job of accommodating me. The food portions are huge, the prices are fair and I never feel as though we are being rushed. We have a group of 9 on average one night a week (Friday's-the only night that they are open late [fish fry night] ) and they always quick to set up our table and take our orders. 
Will return each week for the food, cleanliness and the friendly service."}
{"text":"This is really , really hard as we like to patronize non-corporate non-chain business's 
but this place was horrible . I am not talking about the 40 min. we had to wait for our food ,Hey it was new years day and a bit busy ...no problem  No I am speaking about the food . We ordered 2 burgers and what we got was small portions that were cold , dry & tasteless even the coffee was cold Our server was OK ...we never really saw him 

It is hard to put it into words ....The place just didn't feel right"}
{"text":"1 star is generous. Beware! They advertise on Groupon for prepaid discounts. We brought one that we bought in with us for breakfast, and we're told that they don't honor them anymore and that we could just pay full price for our order and call Groupon to see if they will give us our money back. Now, we only came there because of the Groupon that we had bought. They told us they could cancel our order of we want and we could leave. It's nice to know that a restaurant has so many customers available to them that they can just let people walk out and tell all their friends! This is all over $10. I don't get it!"}
{"text":"Very clean and fresh food I would eat here again friendly service and big servings  and free ice cream with purchase"}
{"text":"Waffle House was packed, Over heard another couple taking about \"Fast Eddies\", With a 20 min wait ahead of us we decided to try it out. Walked in looked like a senior center. Tables and chairs were very out dated. We sat down in a booth. Food was still on the table and the cushions were dirty. Waitress came over after 10 min and asked what we wanted to drink. 10 min later she brought out or coffee. Placed the order waited another 20 min to get the food. The diner wasn't busy at all. I don't know why the wait was so long. The food was ok, service was horrible. One thing that really grossed me out was the a/c return next to the office door. Look up and you will see probably years of dust that has collected. I showed the waitress and she really didn't care. I told her that if I would of saw that when I came in I would of just walked out. GROSS! Sorry Waffle House I will never betray you again."}
{"text":"We came in for breakfast last Sunday (late morning), and were seated right away.  This place is super clean!  Our server was great.  The menu is pretty extensive, lots of options.  Everything we had was really good, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went today for the 1st time.  Average except the steak that was served red when ordered medium well. Sent back. Same color steak brought back 4 minutes later. Told server again about the problem. Her response? \" Sorry about that\". Didnt take back the steak. Walked off and never came back until time to leave the check.  I pulled her aside after and told her the proper thing to do would have taken the steak back and offer to make something else since they were not capable of cooking correctly. She responded with \" My manager said not to do anything since you ordered it medium well\" and turned her back on me. I feel soooo stupid for even leaving the 10% tip that I did. Should have got her name, 20-25 little blond with a dumb tatoo on her wrist. Old guy was the manager that was too chicken shit to come out and deal with a screw up from his kitchen. Yea, ill be spending more money here."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat a late breakfast. Wonderful staff and the food is better than IHOP and Denny's. Sometimes you get free ice cream! Best hash browns ever! Eddie knows how to throw down some grub!"}
{"text":"Service was slow for a friday, but they seemed to be really busy...

I ordered the Eddie Spagetti and it was served like cafeteria food in the lunch room, alot of olive oil keeping the sauce from touching the noodles. The meatballs where huge, though. 

I was starving by the time the food got me, after over an hour and was on my 4th soda.

The server was actually very nice and look just like the governor of Alaska, who knew..."}
{"text":"This has always been a great place to have breakfast. The food is amazing and great prices as well as the service. Very clean and family oriented."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times now. It's a cheap breakfast. It's one of those meals that you just eat and don't talk about later because there's nothing to say. Pancakes aren't to die for-they are just there. I liked the Cactus Wrap that was only about 3 dollars. Pretty good for a college girl budget. There's never much of a wait, which can be great on weekend mornings!"}
{"text":"This is now \"The Cracked Egg\".   Huge sign advertises breakfast 3.99 w/drink m-f.  So I stopped.  It was about 10am.   I searched and searched... No where at all on menu or in restaurant do I see a 3.99 breakfast.  I asked waitress.  She told me that special is over.  Time is nowhere specified. ..no where.   I went ahead and ordered the basic 2 egg breakfast w/bacon.  It was made perfect.  I will stop again....earlier."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. I usually order the Omelette with everything in it. The toast is massive. Makes Denny's toast look small.


Good service and great price. Both Denny's and Ihop are much more expensive. However, some of the reviewers here pointed out that the pancakes may be made from pancake mix.  It is true, the pancakes do taste dry. 

I would go to this restaurant again. more bang for the buck."}
{"text":"I went with 3 other friends for breakfast today. This place sure doesn't look much like a diner to me. I was expecting to see a 50's diner decor inside and instead it was a remodeled Village inn. The food was OK - just OK. I don't know what they cook their eggs and hash browns in, but it made them taste weird. Must be the type of grease they use on their grill. The service was all right but I don't think I'll be back. There's many other places to go for a good breakfast in the West Valley to waste a meal on this place."}
{"text":"Eddie's is what you would expect, a great diner.  You are not going to get exquisite fair but you will get good greasy food!  It will be priced from 1.99 to 6.99."}
{"text":"I come here for breakfast once maybe twice a week and just love the waitress Crystal.  She is pretty fast and remembers what you like which is great.  You can't go wrong trying this place out as the food is good.  Place is clean too."}
{"text":"This is @ least my 3rd time here & really I'm pretty impressed!! Never had bad service or food 4 that matter, but notice a marked improvement each time I visit. We decided 2 visit as the previous day we missed dining here on account of their hours (which I think is pretty ingenious). I'm sure they get a good portion of their business due 2 the fact they close @ 2pm, (unless it's fri open till 8p 4 dinner) so if u snooze u lose! Places like Denny's that r open 24/7 r probably put on the back burner by people that like them because u can go anytime & they'll always b there (except 4 the loc8ions that have shut down).

   I remember back in the day this property used 2 b a bar (named Last Call or something 2 that effect) w/ a weird shaped roof 2 look like a sports arena & there were a few Xs when near accidents almost occurred as drunkards leaving there were almost turned in2 speed~bumps staggering across the road right in2 traffic, oblivious 2 any danger. Glad that's long gone & now replaced by a 60's style place that puts 5 & Diner 2 shame & probably had something 2 do w/ the L8 Nifty 50's & Ed Debevic's being out of business as far as Gr8 pricing 4 Better food w/ Generous portions. 

   1derful classic look decor w/ black & white tiled bar & funny themed signs/collectables throughout. When u come in, make sure u stand a li'l 2 the right (not enough 2 fall in a diner's lap) but enough where u can b seen 2 b seated as their busy tending 2 patrons inside unless u opt 4 grabbing a spot @ the bar top. Their windows have been upgraded 2 the frosted logo/design which helps keep u from cooking while w8ing on ur grub & the bright sun out of ur eyes while staying cooler, Nice!

   Service can b w/ a smile or none depending on who u get as ur w8ress but never had bad & would gladly take their worst over what we went thru @ Kiss the Cook!! I also like witnessing other servers helping out other tables w/ refills, clearing pl8es etc which made us wanna tip them 2 (since they were actually friendlier than our w8ress) but hey, she didn't bark @ us or fling our pl8es like frisbees either so I can handle non~smiling (better than being nause8ingly fake/phony if not naturally 'nice').

   Gr8 lamin8ed menus w/ breakfast on 1 side/lunch on the other & I dig the novel concept of the booth tables w/ local places advertising their business/services (actually jotted down a few of interest 4 future reference). What was ordered: a Veggie omelette chock full of spinach, tomato, onion, mushroom, broccoli florets topped w/ sliced avocado, hash browns, a crispy on the outside fluffy inside waffle w/ all natural syrup, an AMAZING Banana Muffin (shoulda got 2), texas style toast w/ grape & mixed berry jelly, perfect no lumps grits w/o being soupy, & apple juice. EVERYTHING was DIvine in complimentary flavors, textures, freshness & portion!!

   What woulda made this 5*? Bring back your AWESOME Bread Pudding we planned on sharing, that YUMMiness was the *Bomb* & we were disappointed not 2 get slightly tipsy from the bourbon or whatever it was made w/. Perhaps that's why they removed it from the menu/no longer offer it. Can see it now: 'No officer, I haven't had anything 2 drink, I just came from that diner & all I had was some bread pudding!' Tee~hee"}
{"text":"A bit slow.  Food ok, hash browns were a bit greasy, but was able to make the over medium eggs.  Hard to get coffee refill, once the waitress serves you, she is gone."}
{"text":"this place has good food but just don't go if you are in a rush....each time I have gone the food was real good but you have to stay on them to keep your coffee full and try to maintain your patience.  I still go back because of their pricing and the specials, their food is tasty."}
{"text":"I been here twice the two times I've been here I been satisfied to the point I was going to pop. I did feel rushed to order. I didn't have enough time to look at the menu. Other then that the food is good. And the waiters are great"}
{"text":"The service was great waitress was friendly and did a great job. The burger was good fries were just decent not much flavor.  For the price I enjoyed my meal. I loved all the decorations some of them made me laugh. If you're looking for a cheap place to eat that's decent I would recommend it"}
{"text":"I'm really behind on my reviews but here goes:

I've been getting together with old friends quite a bit lately and one of them chose Fast Eddie's.  I grew up in this neighborhood so was glad to see an independently-owned joint in an area overpopulated by chains and \"berto's\".  This is a diner with a menu to match so we both went for biscuits and gravy, with a side of eggs and sausage.  The meals were huge and the pricing was more than generous.  The place itself is nothing fancy but the value and good service make up for the no-frills interior.  Sometimes you just need some eggs and good company and Fast Eddie's fits the bill."}
{"text":"I came in on Friday for the all u can eat fish fry for $10.99.  Best tasting fish I've ate in a while.  They were actually fillets of cod.  Not minced or pressed pieces.  Lightly battered and not soaked in an  oily mess. Came with crinkle cut fries and coleslaw.  The restaurant was clean and the waitress was fast and attentive. Even offered us a scoop of complimentary ice cream after our meals. The fish was fresh and tasted great.  We will definitely be back.  Best fish fry in North Phx and was priced fairly."}
{"text":"You can not beat the steak and eggs special before 9am !
Never had a bad meal here, Breakfast Lunch. Never ate dinner, only open on Friday evenings.
Staff is attentive and friendly.
Very casual Diner type atmosphere. Huge booths for big parties or privacy."}
{"text":"The owner is a class A jerk. Rude and condescending we we're told a table would be ready for our large party and then told they didn't  have one and we would have to wait over an hr. Used to go here often,  will never be back.  Not because of the wait but because of the way the owner spoke to me and treated my family."}
{"text":"I'm giving Fast Eddie's props on several fronts: great food, fast & friendly service, clean tables & set-ups, excellent prices, extensive menu and good music.  This place is a typical diner and you get an authentic diner experience. It's not over-stylized or contrived like \"5 & Don't Eat Here\" and the value for the price is incomparable.

My friend Jason K introduced me to this place years ago and I forgot about it.  The BF & I recently started going again as he's a breakfast fanatic and I love the wide variety and selections they offer from brekkies to lunch offerings.  A few faves include:

- The Nicholson ( massive omelette of sausage, onions, peppers, folded around an order of has browns and covered with cheese).  This big boy is HUMUNGO and only for the most massive of appetites.

- Turkey Club (the fries are decent and the cole slaw is delish!)

- Pancakes are light, fluffy & filling

- Packard Breakfast Burrito - eggs, sausage, diced ham, hash browns, cheddar all wrapped up in a delightful tortilla & served with salsa & sour cream

- Three Duces (the name is disgusting but it's my BF's fave) 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon

Admittedly it gets busy in here on the weekends but we've never really had to wait more than 2 minutes for a table and the food comes in fair order. 

The servers are fast, efficient and no-nonsense.  They serve you, check-in on everything & refill drinks but they don't bug you.

There's hilarious hand-made signage everywhere that makes me laugh every time I'm in.  Note that they're only open until 2pm, but if you get your ass outta bed like a normal person it wont be an issue to enjoy the deliciousness that is Fast Eddie's Diner!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had breakfast. Some of the best Chicken fried steak I've ever had!!! Can't wait to try the lunch items such as the chili burger. Great service!! If your in the area or looking for great diner food head here....reminded me of many great diners back in Connecticut I've been to ."}
{"text":"yum this place is amazing! I went here with a living social and found their food prices to be affordable and super generous. I love the decor of the place it makes you feel like youre at a real 1960s diner. I also went here and got a breakfast for less than $4 which had hashbrowns, toast, bacon and eggs yum!!! what a steal I would totally go here again and again it had lots of parking, great service and a homemade taste!"}
{"text":"Who ever designed the inside must be color blind. The walls are red and pink and aqua and green and blue and.....God knows what else. 

Some elderly woman who seemed to be suffering from dementia waited on us. 

When she brought our food she yelled :PEPPERCHECK  at us several times. Apparently this was her way of asking if we ordered pepper jack cheese. 

The food was a little better than Denny's and a little worse than 5 & Diner. 

A lot of old people.

Weird experience all around."}
{"text":"Been a customer here since they opened this location. Not a great place but its super close to our house so its an easy place to go for us. Just went this Friday for the ALL YOU CAN EAT fish. Only put in one refill order as it took about 20mins to get the refill. When it finally came my child was ready to go and as most parents know, when the child is ready then your meal is done. So the refill order came with 4 pieces of fish and we were able to eat 2 of the 4 but then had to go. When I asked for the check the waitress added 99 cents and when I asked why she said cause I didnt eat the entire refill I ordered. REALLY???? 

Since we had been such long time customers we got to know many of the waitresses and we were told how horrible the owner was to work for and how bad he treated them. And now the waitress told us this was his decision to charge if you didnt eat all your food. I hope that 99 cents was worth it because my family will NEVER come back to this place so that 99 cents will cost you at least 4 meals a month at $30 or more each time.

BAD BUSINESS!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, how I miss this place!  This was our favorite place to eat in Phoenix.  They give you huge portions for really cheap. They aren't jerks about substitutions or special orders.  Just lots of normal greasy food.  They serve breakfast all day.  If you just order a salad, the salads are bigger than your head and they give you a whole bowl full of dressing.  I had the chef salad all the time.

Some of the waitresses are a little kooky, but you soon figure out which servers to ask for.  Jeremy was a great waiter if he's still there.  He'd see us coming in and grab a high chair and find us a table before the hostess even saw us.  Jeremy seems to make it a point to go the extra mile for his regulars. He remembers what they always drink, what they usually like to order, their special requests, their kids names.  That guy earns his tips.  He is on the ball.  The little old lady with the thick accent is slow but she's a nice little old lady.  One of the waitresses with dyed hair is a bit too chatty and we avoided sitting in her section whenever possible.  She's definitely weird but totally harmless I promise!  

If you're all high class don't bother with this place, you won't like it.  If you want normal food for cheap and you want to be full when you leave, this is the place to go.  We would generally try to go when they weren't crazy busy though because the wait can be long sometimes.  Like when the after church crowd gets there.

The decor is loud and smart alecky.  The food is normal diner food.  It is the kind of place that has a lot of \"regulars\" that go there all the time including a lot of older folks.  And if you become regulars like we did, they get to know you and you get to know them and the place really grows on you."}
{"text":"Loved Fast Eddie's diner! This was my husband and my first time here and we will definitely return! The food was good, atmosphere was great, price was certainly affordable and service good. The place had a very 5&Diner feel to it. The waitress seem rushed at first and wasn't very receptive to our needs but that was quickly overcome once we ordered. The portion sizes were good."}
{"text":"Took forever to be seated. Everybody that walked through the door was seated as for we had to wait a very long time. Ended up leaving. The food is good though."}
{"text":"Someone else said it- this is a traditional diner in every way. The fare is pretty simple and done well. The portions are large and pretty inexpensive.  Three of us had large breakfasts (gut busting - and I can eat pretty big) for $15.
  The place was clean and reasonably fast, and the staff friendly.
  I'd say it is primarily a breakfast/Lunch place. I'll come back."}
{"text":"I hated working there, and left with a smile on my face!  The staff hardly ever washes thier hands.  The food is left out on the counters and not cooled on ice.  I saw the tarter sauce sit there for over 4 hours and was warm by the time they put it way.  The owner was a former car wash operator and it shows.  His idea of running a resturant is somewhat warped.  Taste not speed or cheap crap is what will keep a place open.  Someone called it a 1950's style, not even close.  The corned beef hash is from a can, the bread and most food is brought in.  The only thing I liked there was the fried cod on Wed and Fridays, though the coleslaw is premade and just has horseradish added for a punch.  Otherwise, I would not wait for a 3.99 breakfast of eggs (again not kept cool on ice), hashbrowns (real potatos lots of oil plus oily cheese added on top) and bacon over done till its dead.  This is cheap food, and if that is what you want fine.  Just remember to tip the staff."}
{"text":"Good diner food, too bad they don't carry real sweet and low. Also their old thick sliced white bread has been removed. It was better before they made these cost saving changes."}
{"text":"Meh, This reminds me of the place my Granddad had breakfast at with his friends back in Nebraska. It's not very good. However the people there don't go there for the food. They go there to meet their friends, and they go there because they don't know any better. Bland food, so so service,Don is a GROUCH and the place is only half clean. 
This is the perfect place to go if you are 60+ and just want to talk to people your age.
 I won't be back and that won't affect or effect the bottom line of this place Don is happy with the retiree crowd and they are happy with the same no frills no surprise bland food they've had for 40 years!!!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty good breakfast place. Kind of like Denny's and their service there is alright. It's more of a good rest stop type of diner than a family friendly diner."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come on Fridays for fish dinner. 
A group of seven of us go there each Sunday after church.  Food has always been really good and we all order something different.  The ladies enjoy the salads....they stick with the small since the large is for the really really hungry.  Wife enjoys the wraps.  I enjoy everything and especially their chili. Two of my friends always order breakfast...waffles with whipped cream and strawberries and pancakes.  Afterward there is always \"free\"  (nothings free remember) ice cream.
Restaurant (diner) is also fairly quiet."}
{"text":"we really like coming here on the weekends for breakfast, however it's like the Soup Nazi... NO SUBSITUTIONS!   You can't swap potatoes for grits without paying extra nor can you substitute potatoes for bacon."}
{"text":"Fast Eddies isn't so fast as the name implies, but if you have time to lollygag and chatter with the old timers, this restaurant offers a nice hot breakfast at a very affordable price. Daily specials make it even more affordable. The place is spotless and the help is friendly... My favorite... the egg salad sandwich, just like mom use to make!"}
{"text":"Love eating breakfast at Fast Eddie's. Food is yummy and the service wonderful . Every thing we order there has always been good. Can't wait to go back .."}
{"text":"They serve breakfast and lunch at the same time which is a good thing, however because they don't prep/clean their grills their breakfast food taste like lunch food.  For example if you order french toast be prepared for it to taste like a hamburger or beacon.   I asked for a seperate plate so that I could seperat the French Toast from all the other food and when they gave me the plate it was dirty with old katchup and other stuff on it.  Needless to say it made me look around and I also noticed that all the window panes where very dusty along with the condiment holders.  Maybe they should hire someone to pay attention to the details.  My family and I will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"They definitely live up to their name. Fast and simple food at an affordable price.

Food is nothing special, simple but cooked right with decent quality product. 

I was debating btw 3 or 4 stars but I love the service there. They have a great team environment where the waitresses run out eachother's food right away so you get it nice and hot and they never pass an empty drink even if its not their table. 

This place definitely stays on the weekend breakfast short list."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Great food service is also very good. Reminds me of an old diner from the 50's. Biscuits and gravy is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Took over 40 minutes to get my omelet and another 8 minutes to get the wheat toast it came with.. Hmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Family reservations were made four days ago, when we arrived with our party of 25 we were told they don't do reservations and that we were basically lying cause they would never reserve a space for a party that large.
Spoke with the owner and he said no one told us they'd have tables ready for us.
I will never give this establishment another chance.
Fast Eddies is more like fast to turn away your business Eddies!"}
{"text":"Never had anything bad here. All the food is very good, however I will never return. My husband kids & I went on a Friday about 11am & I guess they were having their fish fry Friday & we litteraly waited for over an hour for our food. No one apologized for the wait or anything, pretty rude if u ask me. Plus there's a werido waitress here who's totaly on something & for some reason I'm always in her station!"}
{"text":"I don't think I could have asked for a nicer experience!  I had the classic 2 eggs, hashbrowns, sour dough toast and 2 strips of bacon.  Everything down to the toast was made perfectly.  I asked for over medium eggs and that's what I got!  Not \"runny\" at all!  Perfectly cooked bacon, not too crispy and not limp!  Service was amazing!  We have been \"threatening\" to come in ever since you opened and now I'm wondering what took us so long! Thanks so much!  You guys do a great job!"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in the dinner was exactly what a diner should be. We were greeted right away and seated then had a great waitress take out order. This place was a treasure and with the name Fast Eddies it was truly an order n get your plate right away kind of place. IDE recommend it to anyone looking for some good breakfast."}
{"text":"After doing the Rusty Wallace Experience my friend and I wanted to make it a racing theme day and decided to get food here.  There wasn't a lot of parking as the place was packed.  I was lucky enough to find the one open spot that someone had just left but others after me weren't so lucky.

When we walked in we were blown away by the theme of the placed and I instantly loved the look of it all.  The food was just okay, personally for me, but my friend seemed to like it a lot.

It's a nice and relaxed environment and I know a lot of people that would love to eat here.  It's just not really my kind of food which is probably why I only gave it 3 stars. I recommend you try it and judge for yourself."}
{"text":"We go to Fast Eddie's occasionally for breakfast.  They have the best biscuits ever!  They're huge and SO good.  The food is always cooked to order (I always ask for my bacon crispy and it's always perfect), the portions are huge, and the service is prompt.  It's your typical average breakfast joint.  The only thing they really need to do better is their hashbrowns.  They are always undercooked every time I have them.  If I ordered nothing but bacon and biscuits every time this place would be 5 stars all the way around."}
{"text":"Fast?"}
{"text":"My first trip to Fast Eddies exceeded my expectations for breakfast at a Diner. 
We were greeted as soon as we crossed the threshold by friendly smiling faces and were promptly seated. 
The building reminds me of a remodeled Mexican restaurant, but displays bright colors  with assorted \"flair\" hung on the walls, from humorous placards to framed pictures of locals and their hot rods. 
The dining area is split into 2 main rooms one of which has the long bartop eating with stools you'd expect to see at a diner.
It was around 9:30 on a Thursday morning, there were plenty of open seats. 
As soon as we were sat we placed our drink order and received menus. It's an easy to read one piece laminated menu ala Waffle House.
I first noticed that all the breakfast options were affordable on a low budget and they even have daily specials with reduced prices.
I'm pretty picky when it comes to breakfast, I don't like pancakes which are usually forced on you as a side. Not at Fast Eddies. You have a choice of pancakes, biscuit and gravy, hashbrowns and toast or fruit. My ideal breakfast includes eggs, a meat item, a potato item, and toast. I could order this dream plate, at Fast Eddies without making any substitutions or paying for sides. 
I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs (over medium) ,hashbrowns (topped with cheese is standard) and sour dough toast.
It couldn't have even been 5 minutes before our piping hot plates were brought to the table, I was shocked. 
Surveying my plate I was pleased to see the corned beef hash was crispy top and bottom and didn't look like a pile of raw hamburger. My eggs were cooked perfectly, solid whites with running yolks. The hashbrowns could have been crisper in my opinion but I'm sure that's something you can request. Two large pieces of soft sourdough toast, was served with fluffy whipped butter and a choice of jellies. 
The portions were impressive and my food was delicious, the hash had just the right level of salt and melted in my mouth. I used the last scrap of toast to completely wipe the plate clean. There was no evidence food was served on it.
Our waiter handled the payment swiftly and we were in and out in less than a half hour. Each employee we passed on the way out, smiled big and offered a friendly goodbye. 
I WILL eat here again, there were multiple menu items I wanted but unfortunately can only put down one plate per visit. Fast Eddies was fast, affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"Was up on this side of town, and decided to try this place out.
Food was great, and the portions were generous. My son tried the biscuits and gravy, and loved them. nice large biscuits, and plenty of gravy. 
I had eggs with corned beef hash. Very good.
Fast courteous service with a smile. If im in the area, I will eat there again."}
{"text":"Fast Eddie's is one of those places that you forget how good it is until you go back. The prices are dirt cheap and the food is consistent. Three of us can gorge ourselves at breakfast and walk away with a $20 check. The waitresses are all friendly (sort of like that one weird aunt that everyone has). Service can be a little slow if they are busy, so take a does of patience. They have a relatively large menu and you can order off either the breakfast or lunch/dinner as long as they are open... so if you have a hankering for killer buttermilk pancakes and bacon for dinner, it's there for the taking. In addition to their menu, they have daily specials (you know the drill - all you can eat fish Fridays, stuff like that).

The decor is a little cheesy - they bought out the inards of the long defunct Ed Debevicks, so they have the old \"Eat at Ed's\" signs all over. But the shakes are killer good and the pancakes are light and fluffy. What more could you want from your local dinner hang? Not much, unless you are like me and believe that a side of bacon makes everything better!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast I have had in a long time.

Meat scramble...get it and eat it!

The service was good, she told some stories and laughed with us. 

The B&G is a freaking monster plate, be warned. 

Daily specials are priced right too! Skip the fancy places and come here!"}
{"text":"We've had breakfast here a few times and keep coming back. Tasty food, good service, interesting decor - especially if you like classic cars."}
{"text":"Just darn nice servers in a classic, 50's style cafe, serving up good, honest food, with generous portions, at a more than fair price.  

I have been twice in the past 6 months, both times the place had a nice, mellow yet happening vibe.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Cute place. We got in before the breakfast rush so we didn't have to wait. The waitress was friendly. Food was decent. My only issue was that I had an omelet and they put the cheese on top instead of inside and that is my problem but I prefer it inside. But that doesn't affect the review. Will go back to try the other stuff for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"First time here on Sunday.  Came in late around 10:30am for breakfast.  Not to bad.  We will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Good food, service is lacking! I used to go to mike and Rhondas the place but it is on bell which is a little far. Service is way better there and for quality is same. Maybe I'll go back"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place for years.  The parking lot is usually pretty full.  I finally stopped in here for lunch.  Plenty of choices on the menu.  Jamie was a pretty good waiter.  Apparently many of the all day specials have gone by the wayside recently because of the economy which has hurt the lunch crowd but not the breakfast crowd.  My turkey club was ok but not great, I should have gotten the cole slaw rather than the fries only because of the volume of food (and my waist).  Traditional diner with decent food and pricing, I may go back again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and well worth the drive. The waitress we had seemed kinda grumpy though and not to happy to be there."}
{"text":"Hubby and I go for breakfast here about twice a month.   They have very good food, I love the toast... I know weird but it's so good.   When I say crispy bacon I get crispy bacon.   Always seated fast, food is very good and if you're still hungry after they even give you a free scoop of ice cream :)."}
{"text":"We love going to Fast Eddies. The food is good and very affordable! The most common complaint from customers and servers is that anything extra you have to pay for ie. ranch on the side. It puts the staff in a bad situation because it upsets so many people. They would have even more customers if they just added that cost into the regular menu prices. Saying that,  we still go often and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place since another place we were headed to in downtown Glendale was closed and so glad it was. Great little diner that was real close to home and never knew it.  Lots of menu choices with traditional diner food, I had the hamburger steak smothered with gravy and onions and one friend had a cheeseburger and a couple had omelettes. Big portions for very cheap and entrees come with ice cream so it's a great value. Friendly staff, bright colorful clean atmosphere. I'll definitely be eating here regularly."}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable breakfast with my friend's relatives, who are regulars and know everyone. Good menu variety and all orders were done well. I would be a regular customer, too, if I lived here."}
{"text":"Breakfast food is by far my favorite.  My husband and I both have lived in Arizona/Phoenix area for our whole lives and have tried many a breakfast diners.  We have even tried this restaurant at a different location, but this location was far better.  Our server, Jim, I think, was super nice and took excellent care of us.  The place seemed clean and we were seated right away (Friday around 11am).  

I ordered the 'go big or go home' meal.  My order came with eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, and toast.  Everything was delicious!!  I am very picky about how the food is cooked, my eggs need to be scrambled well (not wet at all) and these exceeded my expectations.  The bacon was also cooked perfectly and wasn't overly salty.  The hashbrowns are worth going to this restaurant for, thin sliced, crispy by request, and cheese on top.  I WILL be coming back, even though it's not that close to our home."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, the place smelled bad like cig smoke, We ordered and we were told that they didn't have the food I ordered so we offered to pay for our drinks and the waitress just as we were leaving stuck our money in her pocket, not the register
I will rate this joint a- 10 bad service no food and stunk."}
{"text":"Water and coffee came right away sitting at the bar. Ten minutes later I was still waiting for the blonde waitress to take my order. She walked passed me like four times!  It didn't seem to be that busy.Too bad because I've lived in this subdivision for 30 years and thought I would give it a try. I decided to leave and as I was walking out the waitress just looked at me without even asking if there was a problem.  I won't be back! :-(  Going back to JB's where the service is always great!"}
{"text":"Well they certainly do NOT live up to their name of being \"fast\". After relocating to the westside I was on the hunt for a good breakfast spot. Decided to try fast eddies. I don't think I will be coming back. while their food was good, they sure did skimp on the quantity. For $7.50 I got the build your own breakfast, the bacon was limp, eggs and Hash Browns were cold and I was almost done by the time the waitress finally brought out English muffins. Keep in mine the waitress is responsible for toasting/buttering the bread you get. I have never heard of this before but my BF from the east coast said he's seen that before. I for one don't want someone who has been handling money, credit cards, and customers plates/cups touching my food. I certainly don't have OCD about that but it's just not sanitary, no gloves nothing. In addition we were seated immediately yet we were sitting in there for an hour and a half to get breakfast. This place failed in my book."}
{"text":"My family comes here off and on since it is near by and pretty cheap. We decided to come in for a family breakfast and while it is cheap, the food is terrible. The eggs tasted more like those liquid ones that are over done, their \"bacon\" strips are like thin sticks that were pretty tasteless, and their biscuits were hard like they were stale. My brother-in-law said their eggs were terrible, but I figured that it was just a bad experience for him... but nope they were bad, but were bad in a different way than he explained (too runny for him... mine were hard and could even choke them down).

The server was slow, and only listened to half of what we requested, never dropped off syrup for my sister's order... took us getting up and asking someone behind the counter for the syrup and Tabasco sauce. She didn't come around to refill drinks nearly as often as I had hoped either.  The place wasn't busy enough to warrant the neglect we received, but I am sure a regular would disagree.

I will not come back here for breakfast at least... but with other places nearby I could choose from, this is the bottom of my return list."}
{"text":"Good mom and pop food. Nothing amazing but the food is hearty in both portion size but also robust in flavor. Remember to try a ice cream."}
{"text":"Not sure I WILL EVER GO BACK. I thought I was going to get that groovy dive or at least diner experience. Well yelpers, there was nothing groovy about my experience. 

1st to our server, sorry to have bothered you by coming in as you were coming down off your Meth high. This woman was definately an addict of some sort. After repeating our order several times and her running to the manager to ask questions, we finally got some food. 

2nd the food? Is this real food or a food substitute? I ordered 2 eggs over medium, a chicken breast instead of a steak, hashbrowns and toast. The eggs were sunny side up runny yuck. the chicken was rubbery with no flavor possible microwave victim. The hashbrowns were under cooked and the toast well buttered bread was more like it. 

3rd back to the server and service or lack there of. The server drops the check and then disappears for about 10 minutes. The bill was like $4.09 clearly that's not right for 2 breakfasts with beverages. So we hunt her down to let her know that she made an error & we were under charged. She snatched the reciept and says \"Oh you would have loved to have this check, huh?!\" She then turned and rushed to get a new receipt. No thank you nothing, RUDE! She came back dropped the new check and then disappeared for over 15 minutes. This check was charging me for 3 eggs, I got 2 eggs. Then she charged me for the steak breakfast plus an ala carte chicken breast! 15.00 later I am searching for a manager. The manager wasn't doing much better in the service department. She basically said I lied and had 3 eggs, because the toothless wonder in the kitchen said he remember cooking 3 eggs. I said did he remember that he cooked them wrong too?! 

Bad bad bad!

This place looked like fun and it's closed to my house. Since they closed the village inn by me I thought this might be a good replacement. I was wrong!"}
{"text":"Depending on the time and day it's a little iffy whether you will get good service. The management really does need to get the meth head servers out of there, as they give the place a bad image.

For an inexpensive breakfast it's pretty good - but I have been there some mornings and the food isn't as good.

We went on a Friday morning and there were a handful of customers and the server couldn't get herself moving fast enough to keep up with filling coffee cups. It wasn't even that busy. 

Probably won't go back for awhile due to the poor service this last time."}
{"text":"Fast Eddies is your typical diner! 

Great fast food, great service, low prices! 

I am a big fan of their patty melt, and I love the crinkle cut fries! 

We've gone for breakfast, lunch and dinner and haven't had any bad experiences yet. 

The decor is lacking, and scary and I feel like I am on the tilt-a-whirl but other then that, Eddies is good if you just want a good bite to eat with out any fuss."}
{"text":"Loved it! We went here tonight for dinner because I've been craving a diner night lately. I had the bacon cheeseburger with swiss cheese, and the boy had the triple decker sandwich with cheddar. We both opted for their crinkle cut fries.

My burger was DELICIOUS. The fries were wonderful. The boy inhaled his sandwich. Our waiter (Jeremy) was super nice, gave us wonderful service. The place was very clean (and very colorful!). I'd definitely eat here again. :)"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. Cheap breakfast special 2.99, similar to village inn quality food."}
{"text":"Love this breakfast dive-- From the sassy decor, to the generous helpings! 

Very reasonably priced, especially considering the amount of food you get. Big bang for your buck. AND on Sundays you get a free scoop of ice cream with your meal. 

The service can be iffy at times. I've had more good experiences than bad ones though."}
{"text":"Fast Eddie's doesn't look like much in the area and from the outside, but once you go inside the place is awesome!!! Lots of really cool car pictures, bright colors, and most importantly the restaurant is clean. Everything I have tried on the menu has been on point, dishes are tasty and more than reasonably priced. I definitely will be be a regular customer, and the staff is smiley, friendly, and attentive."}
{"text":"Agree with the previous reviewer...meh.  We tried Fast Eddie's for breakfast with a family member who was in town.  Service was ok.  Food was okay, but the pancakes definitely seemed like they were from a mix.  I also think I had some sickness later due to the food, so that is definitely a mark against them.  At least it was a decent value.  All things considered, with all the other breakfast options in the area that I do like, I doubt that I'll be back."}
{"text":"This diner has consistently good food and excellent service. The old fashioned style restaurant is definitely a staple in the West Valley. I've never been disappointed with the portions or flavor of food. This is definitely a good breakfast/brunch experience for casual day. My favorite's are there skillets that come with a little bit of everything. For a hearty brunch under $9, you can't beat it anywhere in the Phoenix valley."}
{"text":"How is it that they can offer such a cheap steak & eggs breakfast with sick an amazing steak???  I dint knew what they do to these steaks, but I can't bring myself to order anything else because I GOTTA have the steak. Always fast and fantastic service! My glass NEVER empties and we never wait to be seated. Our favorite breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Good greasy spoon, good prices, giant portions and a free scoop of ice cream with your meal. My only complaint are the extremely limiting hours."}
{"text":"Big portions, good food!  Very clean restaurant, fun decor, great prompt service, and good home cooked eats!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here before but it was years ago. I was hungry for breakfast so I thought I'd come here. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly. The coffee is so weak it's just brown water. I'm sure the meal will be good but weak coffee is reason enough not to come back for breakfast. My breakfast came and I explicitly ordered over medium eggs and said make sure the whites are cooked they were runny whites. The waitress asked if I wanted cheese on my hash browns I said no but I got cheese anyway. The chicken fried steak was bland, endemic the biscuit was ok."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here and i am happy to say it was way better than after they just opened.  

2 egg breakfast with bacon and hash browns were perfect.  Service was excellent and had some sympathy for those of us who were nursing hangovers."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick breakfast last weekend and was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the place and the fun decor. The service was good and our order came within a reasonable amount of time. The quality of food was good and the taste was what I expected it to be. Overall a good experience and average. I would return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great home feel! The food is simple and delicious and cheap! Great service also. If your looking for a place where the food is fresh and comes out fast this is a place to try! I had the steak chili skillet and let me tell you it was amazing"}
{"text":"So I got here and ordered soft scrambled eggs. They brought me an omelet. So I sent it back and the waitress told the head cook Mario that I wanted soft scrambled eggs. So Mario cut open the omelet and sent the eggs back out to me and told her to tell me that they are soft on the inside. I sent all the food back. Sad thing is, he is the manager on duty. Never had this happen here. The food is normally pretty good."}
{"text":"Good food, nice waitress, and CHEAP - meal would cost twice as much in California. Next time we're in Phoenix we'll be here."}
{"text":"I usually have my Friday Night Fish at the Peoria Café but wanted to try another restaurant just for a change but am sorry I did. 
The place was about  1/2 full of guests and I was one of three sitting at the counter only to have to wait 20 minutes for a server. Seemed like all of the servers were having a rough night as I failed to see anyone in the whole place smile, which includes the customers. My food arrived about 20 minutes after ordering and it looked great but one bite of the Cod told me I made a bad choice in changing restaurants. The breading they used tasted like uncooked flour and real chalky, I can't seem to get that taste out of my mouth. The fish itself was nice but the coating was horrible. I hope it was just a bad night but the server expressed regrets for being stuck on the Friday night schedule and her enthusiasm seemed the same as all the ladies working. Come to think of it I have my own regrets for being there, Next week I will be back to the Peoria Café!"}
{"text":"Awesome, good food and friendly staff. Served quick and no problems. I had a touch of diarrhea but I usually have that problem everywhere."}
{"text":"Kind of hidden back in the parking lot, but anyone who loves burgers and shakes and rock 'n roll, who danced the jitterbug and wore bobby socks and crinolines and tight sweaters will appreciate this place.  Juke box music and surley waiters & waitresses complete the picture.  This place gets 5 stars just on audacity.  I love it.  If I close my eyes I am taken back to the old drive-ins with the little trays that hooked on the car window and cute roller-skating cheerleader type waitresses who could balance 4 shakes, 2 soda pops & 6 burgers & fries all on one little tray  . . . and it only cost $3.50.  Well, you won't find those prices here, but the rest of the history is here - on the walls, in the booths and music and most of all in the food.  Fast Eddie's is another time, another place, and another warm and fuzzy memory."}
{"text":"I think Fast Eddie's beats 5 & Diner any day!

As a '50's style diner, you'll find all the classics on the menu: juicy burgers, tasty fries, and of course, creamy, delicious milk shakes.  '50's music blasts from the juke box and the staff dresses up too.

I've had the grilled cheese, french fries and an oreo shake.  Everything was delish in every way.

There is no healthy food here- so if you're wanting to stay away from grease, calories and fat, don't come to Eddie's.  But if you like to get away from reality for awhile and pretend you live in a time when people don't have to lock their doors and Elvis is still alive, this is the place to do it."}
{"text":"I still want to know what happened to the food at Fast Eddie's??? You down graded your food and upped your prices...If your food was still good, who would care..won't be back until I know what happened to the \"Excellent\" Fast Eddie's"}
{"text":"A good place for an early breakfast, because you can get steak and eggs for $6.99 before 7:30. And the steak is really pretty good. Coffee not bad, either. 

The items on the rest of the menu appeared to share one thing in common: Prices 15-20% lower than I'd expect to pay anywhere else.

Good, cheerful, and cheap little diner."}
{"text":"Found this place on the west side of town 35ave & Glendale. So glad we did it has a great fish fry on Friday. $ 10.  All you can eat cod. What a deal it comes with frys, coleslaw or potato salad. The service is friendly & good."}
{"text":"Dayum I cant believe this was my first time here!  

I am a huge diner girl so I seek them out wherever I go.  This place was awesome.  I had a waffle, eggs and bacon.  Stellar.  The coffee was awesome.  

Very clean, service friendly, menu looks amazing, what I had was great.  DO IT"}
{"text":"Well this was interesting.  It is really your basic diner food.  I wouldn't describe it any other way.  Everything you would expect.  They are wicked cheap though.  We're talkin' $3.99 breakfast special with eggs, bacon, sausage, toast...a good decent breakfast for a fair price.  For $3.99 this place is amazing.  Unfortunately, you really get what you pay for.  The quality isn't the best.  The eggs are a bit dry and unseasoned, the sausage is the same way, and the toast was out of the $1 bag of white bread from the safeway.  That's okay, it just doesn't do it for me food wise.  I would totally recommend this place for a cheap and quick breakfast that is a step above fast food."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was excellent.  If you don't want to wait for a table the counter's are open which was nice.  The decor is great!"}
{"text":"Portions were small. Plus, they have a picture of pancakes with pecans and bananas. Looked delicious. Alternating layers of pancakes, nuts and fruit. Yummy. I ordered it and it looked like 3 plain pancakes. I asked where the toppings were and the server said inside the pancakes. They charge you an extra $1 per topping and I could barely taste them. Only in the very middle of the pancake. Quite a disappointment and nothing like the picture. We had a $20 groupon- food for 2 of us came to $15. I asked if they could throw on a dessert to make up the difference and I was told they don't have desserts. My son suggested bacon. Ok, can you throw in $5 worth of bacon? She says I can throw in $4. Fine whatever. She brings me the bacon in a to-go container (since all our dishes were cleared already). No problem, he just ate it out of the container. Imagine our surprise when we got the bill and even though we only bought $19 worth of food for a $20 groupon- we were also charged a \"to-go fee\". Honestly. for $20 you get twice the food at IHOP or Denny's. I didn't even have a side with my pancakes."}
{"text":"Excellent prices, great food and super friendly service. Yay, its my new breakfast spot!

The walls are full of 50's style signage, with some funny sarcasm thrown in along the way. Unfortunately, I wasn't around to enjoy the 50's the first time, so its fun to go to places that try to re-create that 'long since forgotten by most' atmosphere.

They have early bird specials until 7:30 am, so if you go, try to get there early. You wont regret it.

PS. They have 2 locations and are only open evenings on Fridays."}
{"text":"Definition of Meh.

The place is brand spanking new, but the fact that it's the carcass of a former Village Inn, as opposed to a new build, is obvious.
There was a lot of unfinished look around -- not that they weren't done with it, just crappy quality of workmanship.

Look at the new light fixture on the newly painted wall, and see how the paint is smeared all up on the fixture.
Everything sure looked pretty dirty, for only having been open a couple of days....made me think it may have been left over construction filth.
There are sarcastic posters saying they'll eat bisbehaving children, and other such nonsense, framed in RAW sheet metal frames, complete with child-safe sharp corners within little hands reach, for your bloody dining pleasure.

Burger and fries, a diner staple, shouldn't be too hard.  
Supposedly fresh, never frozen, burger but who could tell?  It was bland and in a stange paradox, looked barely cooked to medium rare in the center, and yet was dry and crumbly upon eating.

Fries were ok, and they gave a very generous portion of all the standard burger veggie toppings.

Service was pleasant and friendly in a normal, expected way, but nothing stand-out.  One of the supposedly witty signs said something about \"Sassy Servers\" but I saw nothing of the sort.  (Probably a good bet, since I don't think the NoPho'er Denny's/Village Inn crowd would enjoy attitude ala \"Dick's\" in Vegas)

I would say I'd be back anyway, and very soon, to enjoy their Daily breakfast special -- 1.99 through April 15, then graduating to 2.49 and 2.99 after that -- except that they won't allow substitutions, and I don't eat eggs.
Whenever the dreaded \"No Substitutions\" appears on a menu, or is mentioned at all, I always think of the Peanuts cartoon special where Charlie Brown goes to that Chateau in France, and they keep wandering around finding that everyplace has a sign that says \"No Dogs Allowed\" (and there was a cheesy song to go with it, too)
I am a 70's TV baby.  (which made me laugh at the children's menu items named The Cunningham, The Ralph Malph, and the Pinky Tuscadero)"}
{"text":"Nice friendly, welcoming staff, didn't feel stereotyped. Beats 5 & dinner. Pancakes are awesome. Chicken fried steak delish, over all food was pretty good."}
{"text":"First time here. Lightly battered cod with decent frys, all you can eat with coleslaw.  Slaw had a flavor I didn't care for. Cod had a nice light batter that was crispy but pretty tasteless. Needed a little spice to jazz it up. Cod was well cooked and tasty.
Crinkle cut frys were crunchy outside and tender inside. Tartar sauce good. I'd come back but would order something other than the cole slaw. Service was good and speedy but it was 2:00 in the afternoon. Not the greatest but not too bad. $10.99 for All you can eat is not bad either."}
{"text":"Very casual neighborhood dinner with cheap eats and down home service. Breakfast is their specialty, and their portions are good. You will leave there full, even if you just order bacon & eggs, which is a hearty meal there! Parking is ample, and restrooms are clean and tidy. Only drawback is they close at 2pm, except on Fridays when they have all-you-can-eat fish fry. You should try this place.  They have daily specials that are very cheap and very affordable.  You get more food for the buck at Fast Eddie's compared to IHOP, Denny's and Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Right around the corner from my house, the breakfast is CHEAP, cheaper and cheapest- HOWEVER- the food is actually good here. Beats Denny's (barf) and Waffle House (double yak) hands down every time on quality, cleanliness and price.  Also- you have to go in for no other reason than to see if you can watch the clock without developing a \"Butterfly Effect\" eye twitch or brain spasm. If you don't know what I am talking about- you just have to go in and see!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the many breakfast joints I miss in the Chicago area. Good basic food. Plenty of it. Super low prices. Down-home, informal, good stuff. 

Don't get me wrong... If you're looking for organic and upscale you're headed for La Grande Orange or True Food ($$$). If you want the best tasting breakfast you've ever had, you're going to Matt's Big Breakfast ($$). If you want a place to eat every week (or more) that's good, filling, inexpensive, and convenient for meeting with people... it's Fast Eddie's, Joe's Diner, or Acacia Cafe."}
{"text":"This is a really fun place to eat. I have no idea how I missed out on this place for this long since it is not far from home. I felt like Vic Tayback was going to stick his head out of the kitchen to yell at the servers. lol---- very Divey Diner, 1950's feel to it. The place itself is painted every horrific bright neon 1950's or 1970's loud color you can think of. Goodness the mustard yellow bathroom hallway is just painful to look at! -teehee--They have all these vintage like posters hanging on the walls.
   The food is typical comfort food and Diner fare. It seems breakfast is the thing here so I will have to come back. The prices are very reasonable and they have monthly specials. They also have a M-F Early Bird Breakfast special before 9am. The prices were an even better deal since I took home half of the large portion and had a second meal. I ordered the steak sandwich and fries $8.99 June special and it was not half bad. The fries were those fresh, hot, really good crinkly cut ones. However, for some reason they needed a lot of salt. I also ordered a side of potato salad which was just store bought tasting. The fun thing here is that all meals after 11am come with a free scoop of yummy ice cream.
   Everyone was so nice here. From the moment I walked in the door I was fawned all over by the servers.They were outstanding. So friendly and helpful. The customers were very friendly as well. I even became involved in conversations with the folks at the next two tables. Sigh, teachers you can't take us anywhere. Always talking shop to tables with kids. They did assure us though that Eddie's was the place to be on Friday nights for their wonderful Fish Fry Special. The best in town they said. One was an avid fisherman, no less. I noticed a few other Yelpers noted this too. Hmmmmm, being in Phoenix, this seems fishy to me.  :0)--"}
{"text":"You know, I feel kind of bad for giving this place a two star review, because I really liked our server, but as far as food goes, I can't be that generous.  They do have a great breakfast deal for super cheap, but I went the route of a half waffle with bacon, and it probably came with eggs, but I'm not so sure.  The bacon was really gross.  There's this specific type of bacon that really makes me nauseous, and Sonic has it too, but it just has a sour taste to it that makes my tummy do flip flops.  I took one bite and then left it alone after that.  The waffle looked really promising, but unfortunately it tasted like it was made from the pancake batter so it was really dense and soft, not light and crisp like Belgian Waffles should be.  What a disappointment.  I was ready to love this place and all it's kitschy decorations, but the food was just not nearly good enough."}
