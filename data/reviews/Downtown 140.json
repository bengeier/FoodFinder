{"text":"Had an amazing lunch with a friend. Food was awesome and staff was very attentive. Will definitely go back when in Hudson."}
{"text":"Downtown 140 is a great place for an upscale date or a fun couples night out. We celebrated my wife's birthday there last night. We started with the veal meatballs which came in a marinara sauce and were served with fire grilled crostini. The smokiness of the crostini was amazing and went very well with the meatballs. My wife had the  gnocchi with beef short rib. She was very pleased. I chose the veal chop. It came perfectly medium rare with a nice assortment of vegetables and a bordelaise sauce. Unfortunately we did not leave room to try dessert. We are planning to return with another couple for a wine and appetizers evening. The service was excellent and the ambiance amazing."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the historic part of downtown Hudson, this Resturant is truly a hidden gem. The atmosphere is cool, it is a renovated basement with barn-stone walls... A very \"prohibition feel,\" with a focus on modern day food and taste. 

I got a New Zealand fish, that was flown in that day, it was served over risotto, shrimp and clams. My GF got the steak filet, along with a side of spinach which was all cooked perfect.    

We sat at the bar, there are only a few seats at this bar, and I really liked watching the head chef control the kitchen and cook all the different orders. It was like you were watching a movie, right in front of you, they really know their stuff! 

Price was worth it, be prepared to spend around $100 for 2 (we got 1 drink). It was all worth it"}
{"text":"Deeply average in a general sense, very below average given the prices. 

There for a birthday dinner with my mother.  I live in Hudson, and my wife and I had been there for a drink once before, but never dinner.  The cheesy website had convinced us it would be typical Hudson overblown fare, but I thought I'd give it a shot.

The wait service is amateurish.  The waiter seated us at a booth / chair 2 top, but walked away rather than pulling the table out for my mother.  My chair was covered with crumbs, which i brushed off.  Bad start.

I ordered a Tito's martini up, my mother a gin martini.  Just like my prior experience there for drinks, it was a massive up martini, and completely watered down.  Honestly, it must have been 1/3 or more water.  Tasteless.

I ordered this thing called 'burrata' on the menu, expecting the transcendent cheese, and got some crazy confection instead.  I tihnk they make it in-house, which is supposed to connote freshness, but it just makes you wish they left cheesemaking to someone who knew how to do it.  Besides the fact that they stuff the cheese with some sort of herbs and other 'stuff' rather than just pure cheese, but like a lot of their other food, it seems culinary school got the better of the cooks.  They like to slather their food with all manner of garnishes, sauces, toppings, etc.  Totally antithetical to letting simple ingredients stand on their own.  This dish had splashes and smudges of unidentifiable ingredients, apparently to help the hapless cheese feel even more inauthentic.

For the main I had \"crisped chicken.\"  The menu has this sort of embarrassing \"make your own meal\" optionality (again, suggesting some sort of bad menu consulting gig), so I thought chicken should be relatively unadorned.  Nope.  The chicken, almost sadly, was really well cooked, but again it was topped with a truly awful semi-sweet compote and served on a bed of some sort of puree that was both sweet and tasteless at the same time.  I tried to shovel it all off, but it had infused the chicken: not good at all.

The decor is mid-70s bad, the service weak, the menu cheesy, the drinks poor.  And it's expensive.  Honestly, this is the sort of place that makes one miss a big city with a real dining scene really badly.  This place would stay open for 2 days in Chicago or New York."}
{"text":"We used to frequent Downtown 140 years back, but changes in management and ownership led to some questionable years and we hadn't gone there for a while.  We were looking for somewhere close to go for a nice meal for our 20th anniversary and decided to re-visit Downtown 140.  We are  so glad we did!!

The new ownership and managment has gotten our old favorite back to a place we want to go back to again and again.  Everything we had was amazing.  We started with fresh East coast oysters then shared a crab cake, which was very large with huge chunks of King crab meat atop a fried green tomato, cauliflower puree and infused oils.  Drool.  We were nicely full after that, but since we had a bottle of champagne to drink, we stayed and eventually had to try something else.  We shared the Halibut with potatoes and winter vegetables, and again, it was wonderful.  We would go back for those 2 items anytime, but there are so many other things on the menu that are tempting, especially the pork belly.

Is it in a basement?  Yes.  Should that keep you from going?  No.  The decor is very warm and inviting, and the last time I checked, a good view isn't an indicator of quality of food or service.  Service was excellent, effecient and friendly.  So glad to get this one back in the rotation."}
{"text":"Food and service is unmatched. Thank you!!!  The food is incredible.  We had a variety of the steaks, all cooked to perfection and the meat was incredible quality.  All of the sides were unique, yet simple and incredibly tasty.  Tom was our server and has been the last couple times we've been here.  Tom is unmatched I knowledge and ability.  I.T was our pleasure."}
{"text":"We were here last night for dinner.  140 has a great atmosphere, although when busy (as it was last night), its a bit loud.  The service was EXCEPTIONAL!  Upon arrival, our table wasn't quite ready but we were escorted to the bar for a short wait.  The bartender prepared a fantastic Chocolate Raspberry Martini while we watched.  Our table service was great, Jeremy our server was on top of everything.  Our water glasses were never less than half full and every other need was met as well.  From the segue, we ordered the queso fundido which was quite tasty.  The variety of bread with it was a real treat!  For dinner, we both got the Filet which was beyond excellent.  At one point, I asked my wife to hold the conversation so that I could \"savor the moment\", which brought about a good laugh.  No kidding, it was drop the fork, OMG good!  We were disappointed that there was no room for dessert but we'll save that for next time, as we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just ate here Jan 17th!  Reservation for 6pm and we had trouble finding it ...walked in 10 min late and was promptly told that since we were late there was another reservation coming so we need to speed up our dinner! RUDE! Terrible first impression!   First time here and researched many restaurants in area. Food was average but prices definitely arent...would never go here again.  If we are going to drive 30 min to a great dining experience then we will go to Lolas in Cleveland.  Place is so small waiters are bumping into tables (and our drinks in hand) to move through space. If anyone gives this restaurant 4 or 5 stars then u need to branch outside of hudson to experience great service and food ELSEWHERE."}
{"text":"Fabulous wine, food and service. Superb attention to detail and a true dining experience."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the past two years, every time I come to the area for work. Every meal that I had has been great with the company of great people who work here. Bravo Downtown 140!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites but it ain't cheap. The kitchen is excellent and creative, and the wait staff very friendly.

It's an elegant atmosphere with good live music - light jazz or acoustic that allows you to have conversation at the same time.

I typically sit at the bar for a drink and a few appetizers which can be generous depending. The bartenders are knowledgeable and attentive, and always recognize the regulars by name."}
{"text":"Never disappointed.  Clinton, Andy, Sarah et al. continue to provide exceptional food and service.  
Dishes are creative and inspiring.  Service is exceptional.  Environment is warm and comforting."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time I come to visit the fam in OH, I ask to be taken here. It's super cozy and comfy. Staff is always nice. Great wine list. Food is fantastic. If i have a complaint it would only be that there are so many great looking items on the menu, we have a hard time deciding what to get. I've never been sorry for any decision. We're going back to OH next week and we have our lunch reservations firmed up for next Friday. Woohoo!"}
{"text":"A favorite neighborhood gem. The service is always excellent and food delicious."}
{"text":"Setting was romantic. Service was fairly good. Considering how many people were there at 630pm I'd have expected our dinner to take less than the 45 minutes it did. On the brightest note....the food was amazing. Wild Halibut with brussel spouts. Make a reservation you won't be deserted."}
{"text":"A Review
I haven't in a while but after tonights dinner I have to
What did I have to eat? hmm having a hard time remembering
Oh I know
First the charcuterie plate I'll give it  a TRY IT
and now it all goes downhill
The Belly calms were greasy and glommed together potential yes but just not done well
the deviled eggs really fancy to bad they just tasted like deviled eggs
the lobster and the tuna bla bla bla tasted like a deviled egg that a1/2 cost like 2.50 pretty but tasteless
the Caesar salad oh lets see no taste of garlic, lemon, worchester, just bland not good
the heirloom tomato salad again the heirlooms where cherry sized tomatoes no flavor from the tomatoes just from the blue cheese dressing
and the crab cakes were ok but way from special
Overall I would say SKIP IT!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience!  Great service, atmosphere and food.  The filet was outstanding, and the salmon was also.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is amazing!! They have an excellent wine list. The service is great. You must have a dinner reservation to get in on a Friday, Saturday or sunday. It's a very small space but layed out nicely. The food is fresh and local when available. I had the halibut and it was the best piece of fish I have ever had. It was cooked perfectly. My husband had the filet and it was delicious, it just melted in your mouth. I love the truffle bread they bring for appetizers and the martini were excellent. 
I gave this a 4 instead of 5 because the tables are huge. We were at a table for 2 and it seemed extremely long. I felt like I had to speak loud in order for my husband to hear me. Other than that I love this place. 
The dress code is smart casual to dressy. I have seen people I'm jeans with dress shirts, to people in suits and dresses. It's is pricey but well worth it! Great place for a date nite or special occasions."}
{"text":"Was in Hudson last week visiting my mom and had the opportunity to eat here twice. The second night we had the good fortune to sit at the Chef's Table and it was an absolutely amazing experience! Executive Chef Jim Blevins is a master. Beyond creating some of the most amazing food I've ever eaten he is a hell of a nice guy and extremely generous with information. His attention to detail and the intricate and subtle balance he achieves between sweet, salty and savory create small pates of culinary perfection. The wine list is carefully chosen and the service is totally professional, yet relaxed. Just what one wants when savoring this type of experience. Having eaten fine meals all over the world I have to say Downtown 140 ranks among the very best of the best, for food, service, atmosphere and general awesomeness. It is the total package and well worth every penny! If you ever find yourself anywhere near Northeastern Ohio, do yourself a favor and stop in at Downtown 140. If you love fine dining, you will leave happy!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere alone is unique and intimate.  Small plates are seasonal and the wine selection divine.  Service is always top notch.  Locally owned and operated.  A sure-to-be fave ....."}
{"text":"I love this place. I might move to Ohio for it. I will take off up to 2 stars for uncomfortable seating. All the chairs are padded and I'm currently lounging on a friggin couch at my table!  Anazeballs

Lamb carpaccio was great, the salmon and riesiling were delicious. I hope to come back here for work"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Hudson, hands down!  Nothing more to say!  We've been here a few times for anniversaries or a holiday dinner and food, service and atmosphere have always been great!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant. Their small plates menu is half off during happy hour if you sit at the bar. The service is great and so is the food."}
{"text":"The menu is always changing so as often as we go we never eat the same thing. Everything is always very fresh and interesting and delicious! We also go often just to grab an appetizer and a cocktail before heading out somewhere else. The atmosphere is intimate which makes it a great small group or date spot!"}
{"text":"Nothing worse than showing up hungry to a closed restaurant.  Don't trust hours it says they're open online!"}
{"text":"The owner, Andrew Lowrey, needs to handle his customer service skills a lot better and maybe needs to see somebody for his aggression.  He got extremely aggressive with my husband and I due to our disappointment with the service level and time it took to get the food, the nice couple sitting next to us started chatting with us and agreed.  Instead of  Andrew Lowery being kind and apologetic like a normal restaurant owner would do he got aggressive and asked me to tell him to his face what the problem was and gave us dirty looks and aggressively spoke to us.  We had already told the waitress of our disappointment and she said she would get a manager but apparently they did not care.   I was afraid he was going to hit me so I looked at my husband and we quickly got up and started walking out.  He very angrily said let me get the door and don't you ever come back.  Very disappointing that an owner would make a scene in front of all the customers in the restaurant.  He told us to never come back again, no problem we won't.  If you choose to go to this restaurant make sure you don't complain about anything or else the owner will get in your face and then yell as you walk out the door."}
{"text":"Downtown 140 continues to be my \"most favorite\" place in fine dinning. Andy is very personable and makes sure me and my guests have a great time . Enjoy meeting Sarah evertime I am there .Wine selections are amazing and the food preparations are super delightful to say the least. Great atmosphere with serene lighting adds a class to the nice atmosphere. Enjoyed meeting Lori who has a great personality and she makes sure everything is done to your taste. 
Thx

{"text":"So Downtown 140.......love the space!   Our server was great.  But somehow this isn't my favorite place.  The apps were fab!   Drinks good!    The flatiron steak was literally meat on a plate and the plate needed seasoning.  The spaghetti and meatball was possibly the smallest entree ever.   Don't get me wrong, it was very good but....
Also no very gluten friendly or vegan friendly but they try to accommodate.    My guess is that it will be another few years before I stop back."}
{"text":"Expensive... but well worth it. The seafood was fresh and well prepared. The appetizers were unique and tasty. Interesting atmosphere... dark basement setting but romantic. Friendly staff ( though my waiter seemed pre-occupied with Cavalier playoff game)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants for special occasion or romantic dinner. There was an awful loud vibration in the restaurant which the server said was the exhaust hood fans?  It made for an unenjoyable evening. However recent dinner was average and disappointing. Menu has changed and portions are smaller and lacking originality. This was our go to place but we will have to consider other options."}
{"text":"I'm a business guy and I travel a lot. I'm Aussie too, so I've been around a bit. I've dined in over 100 establishments each in New York, LA, San Francisco and Sydney. I think this Downtown 140 bests all of them. Really? Yup. And yes, I was sober (which is saying something for an Aussie).

I had the Ahi Tuna to start which was really something, then the Ohio Pork Chops with Pork Belly (oh my god), and finally the Citrus Tart (whew). Really really amazing food.

I went on a Sunday night when I expected it to be quiet, instead there was a thriving local scene with a band... the band. The band had a gal playing trumpet, guitar and singing. The pianist also sung. They were amazing.

I went alone as I was on a business trip, but I can honestly say, I had a fantastic time.

I'm taking my client back tomorrow for lunch. I'm hoping it is as good as tonight."}
{"text":"Delicious, unique food and great service. We went to Downtown 140 for dinner for the first time a few nights ago, and were really impressed. This place is serious about good food. It can be expensive though, so keep that in mind. I ordered the Duck Pierogie (delicious!), the Pear and Apple Salad (amazing! Has pears, apples, spring mix lettuce, candied bacon, pecans and blue cheese in a delicious vanilla vinaigrette), and the Scallop entree (perfectly seared scallops over creamy, rich, cheesey risotto. Yum!). My husband had the Lobster Tater Tots which were really good, and the Hanger Steak entree which was served on a large wooden cutting board with a huge pile of crispy fries ..... Not just delicious, but awesome presentation too!  I would like to go back and try a lunch sometime, maybe try out their burger. Over the past few months we've tried a few of the restaurants in Hudson (Vine and Lager, Three Palms, Alladins) and have been relatively unimpressed. Flip Side and Farinacci Pizza are really good, and still our favorites, but Downtown 140 just earned much love from us .... and has joined our favorites list. I would definitely recommend Downtown 140 to any other foodies out there. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been hearing a lot about this restaurant and finally had the chance to eat there for dinner. The dining room is below street level and feels warm and comfortable. Service was superb and there was no rush, even though it took us a while to decide what to order! Now to the wine and food. Their wine list is varied and pricing is reasonable. We ordered a bottle of the \"Frogs Leap Zinfandel and it was delightful! The menu gives you the option of ordering several small plates, which I did, or a nice sized entree. I ordered the Calamari, which was an amazing blend of Cilantro, tiny slices of carrots, and hints of a Thai peanut sauce and small pieces of chopped peanuts. The calamari was tender and cooked to perfection. My guest shared this and also really enjoyed it. As my other course, I ordered the Mussels and frites, which were cooked perfectly, tender, with a nice white wine broth and plated with the frites resting on top. Excellent! My guest had the Halibut, which was paired with shrimp and served alongside a saffron flavored risotto cake. I was lucky to taste a bit in exchange for a few mussels and frites! If you have read my other reviews, I am a bit of a frites and mussels aficionado and both now move up with the best I've enjoyed.
I'll definitely be back and can't wait to try them for lunch as their menu looks very appealing!"}
{"text":"I've been to Downtown 140 twice and had a pleasant evening both times. It's a great spot for a date night or special occasion. It's pretty expensive, though, so it's not a place I would frequent. 

The restaurant is tucked below a home decor store on the basement level, which gives it an intimate setting. 

On our last visit, I got the gnocchi and my husband ordered the hangar steak. We also both got wine - they have a very lengthy selection."}
{"text":"Had dinner here at the recommendation of a client.  I had to think for a minute before clicking 2 stars, but I think it's deserved.  While I was mostly satisfied with the salad (mixed greens with interesting nuts and berries) and my mussels and fries, what happened with my wife's dinner is really inexcusable.  He had the Haddock, $28, I think, so our expectations were pretty high.  One piece came out raw in the middle.  Wifey had already eaten 1 piece, and picked apart the second piece to verify its rawness.  I wasn't looking for a free dinner or even another piece of fish, but I did feel the kitchen would want to know they were sending out raw fish.  When we told the waitress, she offered to have the kitchen cook up the shredded fish a little more or bring us another piece.  We declined.  But she left the raw fish there for us to look at until a busboy finally took it away--and I'm pretty sure no one heard about the raw fish.  I blame management for not training their staff better.  This isn't Bob Evans, it's supposed to be a 5-star restaurant.  I would think she should have told a manager who should have at least stopped by the table.  And leaving the half-cooked carcass was pretty Long John Silver's.  For the price and the 5-star reputation, this was a colossal disappointment."}
{"text":"Maybe the best rib eye ever ... Walleye was very goof ... Stan liked the grouper ... Judy loved the devil eggs ... Even though they didn't show up ... This restaurant is excellent!!!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Downtown 140 once or twice a year, for last 3 or 4 years, and it was always the place we knew where we would get great service, have delicious food, an overall wonderful dining experience. 

 I state 'was' because both food and service were definitely not up to our expectations on this last visit.  Here is the rundown on what we ordered and why we were disappointed:

- Devils on horseback - good as they've always been
- lobster tater tots - mushy, couldn't taste any lobster, believe they were undercooked
- ceasar salad - I didn't have any but my wife said this was the least flavorful ceasar salad she has ever had
- crispy calamari - like the lobster tater tots, we felt this was undercooked; had a very oily taste
- northhampton bay scallops (medium dish) - scallops with bacon and some other items; the oily sauce overwhelmed the flavor of the dish.  Sauce had a burnt butter type flavor.

In regards to service, our server did as best she could but she was handling several tables, one being a large group.  We were often waiting to get our drinks, and in one case, when the calamari was served, we didn't have any plates to eat off of, and we had to flag down a bus boy and ask for plates

I certainly hope this dining experience was an isolated incident as Downtown 140 has always been our 'go to' spot, and it's very close by.  I'm hesitant to go there again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent establishment with a great menu and cool decor.

We came as group from work and ordered several appetizers. The oysters Rockefeller were one of the better preperations I have outside of New Orleans and were done in the traditonal method with a splash of Pernod. They also had a small, but tasty, selection of raw oysters served with a house-made mignonette which was quite good.

We also shared the mussels which came with a rich broth spiked with slivers of jalapenos and crispy pork belly. The broth was great with all the fresh, crusty bread they served to the table.

We opted for a fantastic Burgundy from the reasonably sized and priced wine list which paired well with everyone's entrees which included the scallops, chicken, veal ragu with bucatini, sea bass and my slection, the steak tartare.

The tartare was quite good and served with cripsy toast and a quail's egg. I found it to be very flavorful and, depsite it being an appetizer size, quite filling.

The service was attentive and helpful without being intrusive.

A place we will certainly return to next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"This little gem is tucked away in a downstairs setting in scenic Hudson, OH, a few miles off the Ohio turnpike & well worth the side trip. We sat at the chef's table and had great fun talking to the chef, the owner (cooking right alongside the chef) and the sous chef. The menu changes a couple times a year & we will certainly stop back to try something new next time we are en route b/t Pittsburgh & Chicago. The butternut squash ravioli was the best we've had anywhere and the Brussel sprouts with candied walnuts, red grapes & blue cheese were to die for. The Chilean sea bass was seared nicely & cooked to perfection. The chef cures his own salmon & it is lovely on croustini with corn salsa & dill cheese. Relatively pricey, the portions are large enough to share or take some home for a second serving, and the staff are attentive and personable. If you're in the area, definitely a place to try."}
{"text":"Sara behind the bar knows her wine. Interesting wine choices in a cozy environment. Some yummy appetizers as well!"}
{"text":"We decided to have a quickie wedding and throw a big party later this Summer, so just the two of us went to Downtown 140 for our \"reception.\" We sat at the chef's table (a series of 4 chair stools attached to the kitchen) and had an amazing time. They were super busy but still made a big fuss. My husband had the most gigantic lobster I've ever seen, and it was still perfectly tender in preparation. My short rib ravioli was so delicious, and we had a blast talking with the chef & staff. It is the BEST food in Northeast Ohio. Hands down."}
{"text":"Great place. Came here for a special ocassion and sat at the chef's table for dinner. The chef and sous chefs are great and personable.  They were happy to answer questions and explain about all the different items they were cooking, including items that we didn't order. (Got some tastes of them too). We ordered multiple apps all were great. Got the steak with foie gras topping. Cooked to perfection, trimmed right and seasoned well. Chef let us know we could also do a chefs tasting menu if we came in again. Overall this was a great  restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Had the venison Tartarre and the Veal Osso Bucco! So good!! Wine selection is outstanding but unfortunately no beers on tap. Other then that, excellent atmosphere and service!"}
{"text":"My first time at Downtown 140 felt like I had come home.  I was graciously welcomed and seated by Andy and guided through a wine flight by Sara.  Those two are amazing at what they do, and they seem to have hired staff who have the same passion.  Chef is creative and on point with his \"New American\" cuisine.  It's a bit pricey, but worth every penny.  It has become my \"go to\" place in Hudson. I'm usually there once a week.  If it is open, I see no point in going anywhere else."}
{"text":"Don't take 4 stars lightly... This place is amazing a deserves a visit at least one time just for the ambiance.  Killer!  Food and service were spot on.  The menu was a bit on the small side, but everything we tried, down to even the grilled cheese, were worth visiting again for.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. We only ordered appetizers to share and between the 2 apps and a side of Brussel sprouts that was plenty for 2. Both plates were delicious. Great service at the bar and great atmosphere. Will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner spot tucked away in downtown Hudson! Great menu and atmosphere. Multiple ways to approach this eclectic menu including options for tapas style small plates and traditional courses with great main dishes. Definitely recommend this cozy, quiet place for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic atmosphere minus the crowd (whom are better, richer and more important than you, be sure). But a cozy environment, great wine selection, and each dish was well crafted and had great flavor! Get the mussels! Amazinggggg!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Hudson!  Food was a culinary delight.  Fresh, unique food pairings that are well presented with sauces and garnishes.  Will go out of my way to come back!  Great selection of wine and you choose flights."}
{"text":"What a cute little speak easy style wine bar.  We went on a Sunday night and enjoyed live jazz music and a friendly atmosphere. I like the comfortable seating along the walls with the couches, but I will say that the amount of tables in such a small room makes it different for larger bodies to get to the restroom. All in all, a warm and friendly experience."}
{"text":"The cave ambience was exceptional & enticing artwork graced the walls, wait staff exceptional, food quality, preparation, delivery - exceptional."}
{"text":"We went to DT 140 for our first and probably last time yesterday  - for Mother's  Day.  The food was expensive and disappointing.  We arrived at 2 PM for Brunch. 

My mother had Eggs Benedict.  The Hollandaise sauce was a little congealed, and the potato crisps were over cooked to the point of having a burnt flavor.  Mom was really disappointed.  My wife and sister each had the lobster salad for $22.  There were only 4 or 5 small pieces of lobster, a 1/6 of an avocado, and very little else. It only made a small line of food on a medium size plate.  Taking their time, they finished it within 10 minutes.  

Since I had breakfast earlier in the day, and did not want to order the Halibut special for $42, I ordered a hamburger for $15!  The server asked if I would like cheese, which I did.  This, as I found out later, added $2 to the bill.  The 1/3 lb, salty burger came medium rare (not the rare I requested) on a grocery store type of bun ( the ones that come 8 to a package),  with no lettuce tomato, etc. and frozen style fries.  I expect to pay in the mid high teens for a burger at an upscale restaurant, but $17 for this was a waste of money.

There are too many good/great restaurants in the Cleveland area, to even consider giving DT 140 another chance."}
{"text":"Always a top notch establishment with great music on Sunday nights featuring Mike Petrone on piano. Great wine list, always unique desserts!"}
{"text":"We did not like The Downtown 140! The dishes were expensive small and not that good. I had the Seafood combination. It was hard to find the substance through the shells and it had no taste. Before it, I had raw oysters. I asked for the small ones. They were 3 dollars each and they were so small, I could hardly find them with my fork. Don't ask for the small ones unless you like pretty shells with hardly anything in them.

My wife, who is French, had Osso Bucco . She was disappointed. The quantity was very small and while she knew about the smoked flavor she wished she had not ordered it. The smoked flavor was not for her. For 35 dollars, there was hardly nothing there.

The gnocchi looks \"dry\". Our guest didn't finish them.

The only thing I liked was the service, the ambiance ( noisy, we had to scream to talk) and the Perfect Manhattan.

I got back to my hotel and was still so hungry that I ordered a pizza.

I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"For my first visit to Downtown 140, I threw a lunch party of ten at them, and I'm happy to report that they passed with flying colors and then some. We split three of the deviled egg choices (standard, wasabi, and lobster). I was able to sample the first two, and they were good, but not melt-your-face-off great. I think I just got spoiled by Grandma's. Shame I didn't get to try the lobster ones- they looked decent. We also got the lobster tator tots- loved those. The lunch entree menu is on the smaller side (a plus in my book), and a lot of us chose the mac & cheese. Very creamy, with tender chicken confit and a variety of mushrooms. My sole gripe was that it was advertised with goat cheese, and that flavor could have come through more. Too subtle, I thought. My other colleagues raved about the lobster rolls and French dip sandwiches they ordered. Dessert for me was the popcorn creme brûlée, which was more flan-like, as it came sans ramekin, on a plate with a salted caramel sauce. Tempting to lick the plate clean.

Service was very smooth, even with our large party. The atmosphere is warm and cozy, despite the basement setting. I'd gladly settle in for the evening with dinner and a bottle of wine another day."}
{"text":"I like this place because I can mix and match interesting apps and salads. The devilled eggs @ $2.5 apiece sound better than they taste, with smoked trout and lobster not given a chance to shine. Devils on horseback offer an app that everyone does now - dates stuffed with chorizo and wrapped with  bacon - but the mix of sweet and salty and chewy and crisp still works well. 

I can't  quarrel with the selection of artisanal cheeses and smoked meats, but the accompanying fruit is a joke with two tiny slivers of apple.  Why not provide a magnifying glass some can find it?  The apple or fruit should counterbalance the rich flavors of the cheese, but 2 slIvers of fruit doesn't do it.  

I think the presentation is a shade better than the flavors, but it's still a welcome oasis in the wilds of Hudson."}
{"text":"Dr Jekel and Mr Hyde.  Not in a playful fun way either...

When I was driving to the restaurant I nearly couldn't find the place.  Very small sign and an inconspicuous door that leads you to the basement below a boutique.  Then as I walked in I fell in love with the place.  I felt like I was in a speak easy - this small, basement restaurant with brick and stone walls, low ceilings and dark atmosphere.  It was so cool I thought this place is going to be something special.  

I looked at the menu and saw the drink prices.  I was taken back a bit - I mean I've been around the block to nice places in major city's and downtown 140 had drinks prices that rivaled those places.  No matter - if its superb food and service then its worth the price...everything has a value. So I ordered a beer mainly because I felt like one.  

To the menu - also a bit pricy but again I was thinking this place was just going to be dynamite...as I said I fell in love at first sight.  We ordered the calamari, the pork belly and the mussels app.  To be honest all of them were very good.  The calamari was basically thick cut and not hardly breaded; it was lightly sauced, perfectly cooked and well garnished.  The pork belly was decadent, a little sweet and came with an interesting sauce that I really enjoyed.  The mussels were also perfectly cooked and came in this white broth that was light and flavorful.  

I ordered a salad and they brought the wrong one.  No biggie at all - but you could tell they rushed the correct one because it was the most disheveled salad I've ever seen.  If I got this thing at a american chain restaurant for $2.50 I would have laughed at them.  So for $10 it wasn't a joke anymore - just sad.  A couple pieces of bib lettuce with some grapefruit and avocado - and I think they forgot the walnut oil as well.

Coincidently all of us at the table got pasta dishes...i guess we were all drawn to the fresh, hand made pasta.  You don't see that much anymore which is a shame, so I was able to try three of them.  When they came out the portions were small for the full orders but I was ok with it.  Usually there is too much pasta as it is at restaurants.    The fettuccini was the best all around - it had a decent sauce and the pasta was cooked by far the best out of all of them.  The cavatelli was just ok...nothing special.  The wild boar ragu sounds far better than it tasted.  Lastly the parpardelle was the worst...far overcooked pasta and little flavor.  Also, coincidently this order was the only one that was a half order - now this was clearly a joke.  The portion was the size of a small soup bowl...and I'm not kidding.  This should not even be offered - how can someone order this for their meal?  If you are going to charge $26 for pasta dishes (with very little protein mind you) they should be OUTSTANDING.  This was just not the case.  

Funny thing is, I will be back.  I just loved the atmosphere and coziness so much.  I'd come back to share an app and have a drink with my wife here...the only problem is 2 drinks and an app will set you back about $40.  Maybe its a hudson thing, but I'm sorry hudson you are not times square."}
{"text":"Just went there for appetizers and drinks. But great atmosphere! Great service - very knowledgeable about beer selection and menu. She recommended the pork belly appetizer - it was amazing! So was the shrimp appetizer. I wasn't a fan of the grilled artichoke :/ I had 2 martinis the 'tie me up' and the 'texas' something.. they were fantastic. Definitely a must try - when your pockets are full."}
{"text":"Went back last night and, as usual, had a wonderful meal. I do, however, have a few nits to pick, thus the 4 stars versus 5.

We had one selection from \"First\" (see menu, it's online) which was the Ahi Tuna Cone (delicious!), two from \"Segue,\" the longstem artichoke fritto, toasted garlic breadcrumbs, pepperoncino gremolata, lemon aioli, and an incredible white bean soup. The artichoke was very tasty, but, note to the kitchen, one of the marks of a great restaurant is to serve fried food (especially flash fried) that is NOT greasy. This was greasy, which, frankly, shocked me.  Almost said something to our server (Michael, who was just great), but decided not to. 

We tried their special stone crab claws--well, one, actually, and that was  grossly over-priced for the amount of meat inside. I'm talking incredibly little. They only have them a few times a year, and if ours was a typical example, we could have easily split a half-dozen, but at $10 a piece, that was not going to happen. Look, I've spent almost $500 for dinner so it's not about the money, but it IS about getting something you at least perceive is worth it. That lonely little crab claw was not remotely worth it in our opinion. 

My wife and i each ordered the braised short-ribs special, and it was incredible great. No question, the kitchen knows what they're doing in a big way. 

We shared the molten lava chocolate cake and that, too, we excellent. 

As I said above, our server Michael was fantastic. Attentive but not smothering, extremely personable, good sense of humor, just overall a professional from beginning to end.  

So, DT140 is STILL easily in my top 3 upper-end restaurants in the area, I just thought there were a few little misses. But at this price point you don't get five stars unless everything is perfect.  Will we be back? Of course we will."}
{"text":"Amazing oysters, food, and service. Our first time here and definitely won't be our last! Thanks for a great night."}
{"text":"Like many other reviews you'll come across, the food here is top notch- a truly unique pallet of flavors to explore. I brought my spouse here for his birthday dinner, since he had been here once before I suggested making reservations but he insisted we didn't need to. Although you aren't required I would strongly suggest doing so as we were sat directly next to the open glass doors where tiny gnats & a constant cold draft annoyed me throughout the meal. I felt as if we had been seated there as punishment but didn't want to make a big deal out of something so insignificant. 
 The environment is beautiful yet a little hard to appreciate; you can't go wrong with exposed brick pillars & beautiful stone walls. Yet it is so dark & confining...the couch my spouse sat at appeared to have stains & cigarette burns all over it. Yet our waiter; Derek more than made up for it. He was an absolute delight!  Professional yet jolly, perfectly attentive & knowledgeable. 
  My husband LOVED his food! He had the beef tartar & duck breast with a baby beet salad. The look of enjoyment on his face was priceless, lol. I had the pureed potatoes that I found to be the best ever! The texture and flavor were like nothing I've had before. Unfortunately, the cavitelli  dish I had wasn't worth the price (& in all honesty) tasted 10xs better the next day. However, this pl;ace is not budget friendly nor casual by any means. You would find yourself out of place if you showed up in jeans & a nice shirt so be prepared to spend an entire paycheck here- it was just $30.00 dollars shy of costing me $200.00 just for the two of us & I only got an app & 1/2 order of pasta :/ This is also NOT a kid friendly place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been Downtown 140 fans since 2004, following the restaurant as chefs Monday and Triskett changed over.  In fact, we have dined there 26 times (thank you Quicken) and adored the place, but our most recent meal was a complete disaster.

Having a great bottle of 2004 Grgich Hills cab at home, we decided to bring our own bottle.  I took the waiter up on his offer to decant.  He proceeded to empty the entire bottle of wine, sediment and all, into the decanter.  The better restaurants I've been to (with waiters that know what they are doing), will always leave the bottom half inch or so un-poured so you do not get the sediment in your glass or decanter.  Not off to a good start.  Our great wine now makes your mouth feel full of grit when you take a sip.

We started off with the cheese board as an appetizer, which we have gotten there many times before.  The cheese options were good, but the selection of accompaniments was terrible.  It consisted of cheeses, toasts, a few grapes, and an odd jam.  Strangely enough, it was missing any kind of toasted or warm nuts that I've had in the past at 140 and other restaurants.  The toasts for the cheese were so incredibly salty and over seasoned, they were inedible.  The board included no other cracker options.

My wife then ordered the squash bisque.  What arrived was watery, salty, mess.  Its bisque, it's supposed to be thick and creamy, not watery.  Plus I suspect the same person lacking taste buds for salting/seasoning the toasts also prepared the soup.  For the first time in 25 other past meals at 140, we sent an item back to the kitchen.

For the entrée, we both got the filet. What arrived was dry, lacking any flavor, and with nothing exciting about it.  I've had the filet that was prepared while Don Triskett was there and it was a blow my mind experience.  The complexity of flavors and texture of what Don put together was amazing (my mouth waters on just the memory).  Unfortunately, their current filet lacks any complexity what so ever and it is neither a spin on elegance in simplicity, since the quality is so poor.  I'd rate it in line with chain restaurant quality filet.  In fact, last weekend, my wife and I were laughing at Lager & Vine because they put out a better filet than Downtown 140.  It's ridiculous..

Normally, my wife and I are big dessert fans, but our experience was so awful that we could not wait to run out the door.  We paid our check and got the hell out of there.  As we left, we shook our heads in disgust, because our favorite local restaurant seems to have been destroyed.

I don't know what is going on at Downtown 140, but I do know one thing for sure; the dining landscape in Hudson has changed dramatically since 2004, with many new options opened up.  I want to love Downtown 140 again since it has been our \"to-go\" spot for a wonderful dinner for nearly a decade, but this last meal has drawn a line in the sand.  I'm not stepping into that place until they get a new chef.  Any chef or sous chef that would let that garbage go out under their watch, should be fired immediately.  With the disgustingly over saltiness of the toasts and soup, it is obvious that they don't even bother to taste the food they are putting out.  It is an insult to Downtown 140's history of great food and great chefs who have worked there and moved on.  

Please Downtown 140, get your act together."}
{"text":"5th sweetest day here!  Always a great atmosphere, amazing service, and strong drinks.  

We were seated right away even though we were late and it was sweetest days AND i turned down a table right by the door.  Great!

We had the same waitress that we had from last sweetest day (we go more often, but going here each year on this \"holiday\" is a tradition) and she remembered us - always a great feeling!

However, as their menu has changed, there weren't as many things that I perferred to order.  Their amazing salumi plate is gone, as well as many of the small items I used to love to share.  We ordered the chicken liver mouse, which was amazing and a few other small things, but wish they still had some of the old menu in place."}
{"text":"Wine selection great. Pork belly is amazing. Meal was outstanding. We will be revisiting."}
{"text":"Downtown 140 is my favorite restaurant in Ohio for a reason. You may not know it from the look of the entrance (it looks like you're going into a basement) but they prepare excellent dishes consistently. I have never been disappointed with a visit to Downtown 140 (and I have visited dozens of times). The meats are always done to perfection. My favorite is the hanger steak which is full of flavor and texture. They pay attention to detail and the staff is very attentive. Never pass up a chance to eat here if you're in the Hudson area (or in the Cleveland area for that matter), it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Lunch was pricey as selections were top shelf. Service was very good for our group of 16. Portions were appropriate. Comments included the cauliflower soup was very good tho a bit salty. Salmon was also salty. Duck sausage was good. Venison tartare was excellent. Hamburger and baked chicken were tasty, too. Has a large wine selection. Nice atmosphere for a romantic occasion."}
{"text":"Great food every time!  Each and every time I visit downtown 140, the meal is amazing. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a new place to check out!"}
{"text":"We dropped in for a Saturday evening appetizer and drinks. The hostess deserves a higher rating than I'm giving--despite being very busy, she was very accommodating and friendly.

A friend from work recommended we go here, touting a cheese plate that rivals L'Albatros in Cleveland. We had high expectations. We were let down, and next time we'll just go to Cleveland. Our waiter was highly unprofessional and absent-minded, obviously had forgotten our drink order at one point and made a show of running to the bar after we'd seen. We had to hand our menus off to another person because he couldn't be bothered to take them after we ordered. I asked for a wine recommendation, but the wine I received was nothing like what I had asked for--I stated robust and spicy, received mild, almost bland. Small details like these count when you are trying to tout yourself as a fine restaurant. 

The cheese selection was incredibly lacking. I think we've been spoiled by L'Albatros where the specialty cheeses never disappoint. Here, we were given the choices of \"Uh, a brie, goat cheese, cloth-wrapped cheddar, and Maytag blue.\" We ordered a couple as well as some meat choices, and a half order of lobster mac and cheese. It took over thirty minutes to get our appetizers. We approached the manager, who ended up removing them from our bill, but seemed disinterested in anything we had to say. The extras on the meat & cheese plate were nice adds, but we would've rather had better meats and cheeses. 

The lobster mac and cheese lacked as well. We found a few chunks of lobster, which was good, but the overall flavor wasn't great. 

Probably won't go back. One can attribute their slips to it being a busy Saturday, or to lack of professionalism and inability to meet the expectations their image is attempting to exude."}
