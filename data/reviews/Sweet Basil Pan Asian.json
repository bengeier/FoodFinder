{"text":"Restaurant is clean, service is quite accommodating, but the food is par. Nothing special."}
{"text":"I agree with Imran. Fantastic Thai food, it tasted better than some of the stuff we had when we were in Krabi. Although it is in a random location. The food is good enough here that they should have a better location, instead of being in a plaza.

I love a good Thai green curry, and these guys do a fabulous one, and they have great lunch time prices. The service was very good, and they don't hover over your table like some other servers we have met recently.

We have been back for dinner since, and loved it, again!"}
{"text":"Completely random place to find a good thai place. 
Next door to my dry cleaners, i decided to try it out.

the ambience is strange, because it still is in a random plaza where the only other restaurant is subway.

But the food is surprisingly good. It's pan asian which means they do every kind of asian cuisine in their own little way on the menu - thai mainly, with malay, viet, japanese and indian influences. 

I've had stuff lemon grass mussels here which i have never seen before. it's called Kiwi mussels and it's a must order. 
The crab is great. This is the only other place in the whole of Toronto to serve curry crab (saigon star being the other). 
Their signature basil dishes are a little too gravy less for my liking, but still pure and fresh. Their curries are good.
The beef/chicken lemongrass salad is also quite good, though i prefer it when the beef is not cooked but rare as is traditionally served.

Overall everything is good. Not amazing but good.

I would not however order the tom yum soup. It just seems really fake. 

portions could also be slightly bigger, but they make up for it with quality of ingredients."}
{"text":"Sweet Basil served a mixture of Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese food. 

The restaurant is nice and clean. The deco is simple but chic. The seatings is really comfortable.

However, I would not say this is authentic ethnic food. The spices are all toned down to suit the Canadian customers. We were there for lunch and we are the only oriental people there :). 

Sweet Basil does have a good lunch menu ($5.99 - $7.99)! There are a lot of different choices. Even my vegetarian friend found something she enjoyed!

In light of the spirit of Pho-bruary I still stick to my Pho lunch. I ordered the Beef Pho in spicy tomato soup with vegetarian spring roll ($5.99) and my friend ordered the Thai Mango vegetarian combo with spring rolls/vegetarian hot and sour soup ($7.99).

The spring rolls are fresh and quite tasty. Ok I ate all 3 spring rolls because my friend does not like anything deep fried. So they must be quite tasty for me to eat them all :).

The hot and sour soup does have a lot of ingredients inside. However it is not Hot (not spicy hot or pipping hot). It is pretty thick in consistency but it is luke warm. I think it is lurk warm that's why it is thick.

I did request extra extra spicy for my Pho. However the broth comes out lukewarm. That does create a problem since the beef are served rare so they cannot be cooked proper in the warm broth. The broth is not hot (spicy or pipping). There are tons of fresh tomatoes inside and chives. The noodles is the dried type but it tasted ok. However, I would not order this again when I come back for another visit.

My friend's Thai Mango stir fried has pepper, mango, mushroom, carrots, baby corn, onion, dried tofu and water chestnut. She finished the whole thing! She said it tasted really good........

I am so glad that she enjoys her meal because sometimes it is so hard to din with vegetarian friend.

They accepts Mastercard.

I would come back to try out other lunch specials but it would not be eating Pho. And I would have to tell them XXXXXX spicy!"}
