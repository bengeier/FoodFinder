{"text":"Watch for what they charge you for.  Ordered the kids meal and still got charged for full combo. Chicken taquitos.  Sick all night. At least I got thru the concert before it hit me. Maybe it was the green hot sauce???"}
{"text":"My bf, his dad and I come here every Tuesday for tacos. Great value and friendly service. 

Our main critique- consistency. There have been a couple times where I was ecstatic. The food was fresh, delicious and portions were perfect... Then there are times where the meat is tough, flavorless or they totally skimp on portion sizes.

Over all, we are pleased and will continue our tradition here."}
{"text":"Greasy, Greasy, Greasy!  And super expensive.  I have had Chronic in SoCal in the past and enjoyed it but this location is terrible."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional, they pile on the food, very clean dining area,  and the food was great. I will definitely be a frequent customer.  Keep up the good work Chronic Taco."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food here is amazing...... when it gets to you in a timely manner, correctly, and at the right temperature.   

I have been here three times. The first time, my tacos and my boyfriend's tacos were cold. I don't really know how they managed that, as the tortillas are pressed in a warmer right in front of you and the fillings are held on a steam table that is presumably a temperature that complies with health department standards.  On this trip we also got the chronic fries, which were awesome and hot, but took about a month to come out of the kitchen. 

The second time, I came here only for the chronic fries, because they were so good the time time before. This time, they still took a very long time and when I began eating them I noticed they did not have the carne asada on them, which costs extra and I had paid for. As this order was to go and I was already back at my work place for the day, there was nothing I could do but eat my fries that were made wrong and I was overcharged for. 

The third time is today.  My tacos were again cold, and. The chronic fries were again the last thing out of the kitchen. Again they were wrong. We asked for Spanish rice and black beans on them and they did not come out with either item on them. 

I get it that this place is somewhat new and may have to work out some kinks, but it has been at least a month. They have a lot of potential, since the food is wonderful when it is correct and hot, but they really need to begin living up to that potential. SOON.  I don't care how good your food is, if your service sucks, I don't return. Chronic tacos will probably only get one more chance from me to get it right.  MAYBE."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my shrimp bowl-rito! The flavors mix well together and the portions are generous. There is a good variety of options on the menu including basic options (tacos, burritos, quesidillas, etc.). The menu also has some unique items such as nachos that use fries instead of chips. There are also a variety of toppings to choose from! The only thing that I didn't like was finding a lot of avocado skin into guacamole. A great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"When I walked inside I first noticed there were only 5 customers in the place, the tables were dirty and the music was a bit too loud for my taste. I ordered two tacos of pollo asado and carnitas, the meats cold and dry with not much flavor.

This was my first time in and it will be the last...With at least five employees in the place they could have tried to clean the tables and chairs during this slow time."}
{"text":"The place was clean and service was ok. Wanted the fish tacos but they pony had the shrimp do I decide on the al pastors.  Should have had the chicken or beef because the pork was very oily and more fat than I would expect from an upper end street taco place."}
{"text":"Had 3 tacos el pastor, steak, and chicken. Very bland in taste when you add sauce, cheeses, vegetables etc. I was thinking this would be a classic Mexican taco with an American twist but it isn't. Its like a poorer version of chipotle. 3.25 per taco was pretty expensive as well. I mean, if I enjoyed the food I wouldn't mind the price but I didn't. Save your self the visit and go to Taco Mex or Chipotle."}
{"text":"I heard about his place before and always wondered if the food was good. My verdict is yes.

The decoration of the restaurant is cool and it has that \"skateboarders at the beach\" southern cali feel to it. They have a wide variety of food there but like any spot  I go to that serve Mexican food I gauge the food by how good the carne asada tacos are and I must say that although they are a little bit pricier than what I am normally used to paying, they were very good! The meat was flavorful and juicy. The setup is similar to Chipotle or Zaba's were you pick what kind of filling you want. I went with the simple \"authentic\" onions, cilantro and salsa. The guy who was making the tacos was like \"is that all??? no lettuce or cheese?\". I know that most people who like to eat more Americanized tacos like to have lettuce and cheese and all that but no self respecting authentic Mexican food lover like myself would do that to a taco. I can see how that would justify the $3 each asking price though if you get one of those \"super duper supreme look i got all this stuff in my taco\" kinda tacos so I'm not knocking them on that. The other thing I got was the chicken flautas which actually were really good although I think they were frozen and not fresh. If I go back, I will have to try the enchiladas cause I love me some enchiladas too.

Oh and the staff is really nice and friendly too. I wasnt able to find a lid for my drink and one of the girls notice me walking back and forth lookin for them. She apologized and ran in the back to get some more and said that next time to tell them right away and they will give me a bigger drink for free! Pretty cool if you ask me!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting food.  I ordered a carnitas burrito and I found weird mystery balls of fat (filler?). Not sure what is going on in that kitchen but I'd stay away!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went there for lunch at work. The two girls behind the counter spent easily 5 minutes talking to each other before helping us. They had poor attitudes and we're inexperienced. Neither of us got what we requested even though it is similar to Chipotle. The girl put onions on my burrito with out me asking then was upset I didn't want them. Others at the tables next to me had the same experience. Maybe with time it will get better. The food was so so. I would not go back."}
{"text":"YASSSSS who doesn't love tacos? I am a vegetarian and this place is just amazing! Taco Tuesday is great."}
{"text":"Had a carne Asada burrito it's was pretty good. But I do like chipotle better."}
{"text":"The food was great. I really enjoyed the small burrito. The small burrito meal was enough for a big guy like me, too. 

The service was slow and inexperienced. You can tell the food assemblers were inexperienced with putting everything together, and the flow between them and the cashier was a little broken. Cashier was still figuring out the POS system, too. 

I'd wait again for a while until the staff gets used to the operations before I go back, but I would like to go back sometime."}
{"text":"Great customer service from Andy and amazing food. Quality ingredients and A++ service. California burrito one best I've had."}
{"text":"I have a small burrito. It was OK the meat was a little dry and the Spanish rice was old so it tasted weird. My husband had the tacos and he liked it."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night had tacos 3 different meats and it was awesome the meat was tender,full of flavor and the toppings were out of this world James is am amazing cook not to mention the great customer service from management and his team . Will be returning real soon. Thank you great customer service."}
{"text":"Great flavor on the meat. Got all 3 proteins and enjoyed them all. Tocos or buritto it don't matter we enjoyed them both. Good late night as well, the salsa was mediocre at best though, wouldn't recommend it. The rest was great eats and they piled my tacos with all the fixings. Guacamole, pinco, sour cream, jalapenos, lettuce, etc all is included in price. Yummy sh** right hear guys with refills on drinks it's the spot to eat and chill"}
{"text":"Awesome, no frills Mexican food. Being a vegetarian, I cannot comment on the meat items, however, their black bean and pinto bean options are perfect! Great flour tortillas, fatty sized. Love that they do potato tacos! SoCal style, like my favorite Snapper Jacks would make. Living here locally, I actually go out of my to the Palms to grab either a burrito or a few tacos. I have no clue why the other reviewer compared it to Chipotle, who I think is way overrated. Oh, and since I can't stand that cilantro white rice, I'm glad they also serve good ol Spanish style rice! Oh and for meat eaters, I'm told their tortas are xcellent.
So, locals and visitors, if you want no frills,SoCal style Mexican food, stop by Chronic Tacos in the Palms casino. Or, if your in SoCal, they have quote a few locations."}
{"text":"I went into this location on three separate occasions. 

1) seemed fine, the workers didn't know how to explain the menu so I kind of stuck to ordering a burrito (chipotle) style. Tasted really good but I paid a sold $17.78 for a burrito meal.. should have gone to chipotle and treated a friend to a meal for that price!
 
2) gave it another chance since my co workers hadn't been in. I and another coworker ordered burritos so no issues, tasted good. My other co worker got a quesadilla w/ veggies.. They did not have the veggies ready so her order had to go back into the kitchen... Needless to say, I ordered the same thing as last time, paid $10 this time around and my co worker finally got her quesadilla with veggies AFTER my co worker had to complain to the manager...twice! And as we were finishing up with our burritos. She also said it was bland and not worth the overpriced amount she paid! 

3) went in on a Thursday night, there were ppl in there but no line, ordered my usual and they didn't have any rice made, said to wait 2-3, I waited 7-9 mins. and they were finally able to toss some from the kitchen over into my burrito,  the employees looked pissed, lazy and not wanting to be there and the gentleman that checked me out or any other staff did not even apologize for the delay in not having their main option, wtf? Paid $10 this time too, had the burrito but it was very BLAND, Disgusting. Tossed it !! as we were leaving the manager like figure asked how it was and I said it was ok! He apologized because he had seen us waiting for a while and we said ok.. Then he came chasing me down as I was sitting in my car with a free Taco with a meal or something. No thank you. 

Honestly, gave them 3 tries, service is horrible, food is decent, good luck figuring out what you want to order since no one knows to really help you.. And if you order something from the back kitchen, good luck getting it in time!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best Carne Asada I have eaten in years! Tender juicy grilled flavor everything you could ask for in Carne Asada! The Al pastor is simply delicious. Great food great prices I would have given them five stars but their line and kitchen staff is a little disorganized but don't worry that's not enough to stop me from getting such great food!"}
{"text":"Grilled shrimp burrito deliciousness. Add as many veggies as I want??!....don't if I do!! Completely customizeable.

See lots of reviews of people ordering fried food and upset because it is greasy....self explanatory."}
{"text":"First time here.. really good food! Fresh ingredients. I will deem it the Mexican subway.. you pick your ingredients. Clean store, nice atmosphere and friendly employees!"}
{"text":"I work for a very large law firm and we have Chronic Tacos Cater our Luncheons at LEAST twice a month. The team there is amazing. So friendly and helpful. I love their rewards program too."}
{"text":"Delightfuly different.. had the bowl..chicken is amazing.. just that quantity is less.. but definitely tasty !!"}
{"text":"My family was very difficult to handle but the team member was able to be kind and courteous with us and dealt it in a great fashion that makes me want to come for more and enjoy eating this great food :) two thumbs up"}
{"text":"I always want to come by to have a nice taco break but talk about depressing when you walk through the doors. I understand when you work; you're tired and grumpy but you don't show it to people you work around. The employees seem depressed and not in a decent mood to work and the music around them is in a happier mood than them, I sometimes feel like I shouldn't order anything! Beyond customer service, the food is 4/5 stars. A bit salty but still nice to eat.

Maybe it's time for new employees or some fun ways to keep them happy?"}
{"text":"Katie and I were in the neighborhood and came across this place. The ordering process has the vibe of another burrito place with everything available for you to see.  I had three corn tacos with carne asada, al pastor, and carnitas. Katie had two pollo asada tacos. Everything tastes good and the selection of toppings means you can have something different every time. The atmosphere was a little noisy due to an opening party, but you are surrounded by tv's and the radio isn't too loud. 
We will be back again in the near future."}
{"text":"I'm new to writing reviews but I work in the food industry so I try to be as complimentary as possible, but this place was a dissapoontment. Keeping it 100, I used to work at cafe rio and I was expecting a similar experience. I ordered a Carne asada burrito. It wasn't ran through an oven so it was served to me pretty cold. It tastes ok, but I like my burritos warm."}
{"text":"I tried the Chronic fries and wasn't blown away. The meal was a little too pricey to go back. The owner and the people who worked there were very nice though. It wasn't a bad dining experience but if you've been to Chipotle it's almost the same thing here. A place for hipsters to buy unauthentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Went the other night and wasn't impressed. It's like subway for tacos except more expensive. Can't say it was dirty but it wasn't clean (tables and floors had bits and pieces all over)."}
{"text":"Bland food, slow service, small portions and not the brightest staff. The fish was also fishy. The restaurant itself was super clean so 1 star added for that."}
{"text":"Great place for fish tacos.  I ordered the fish tacos and was surprised how filling it was. The wait was average being it was Tuesday afternoon, but would recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"Ran out of everything at the start of lunch hour. Ordering took forever. Not a place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Food is okay tasting but if you are in a hurry I suggest going to some place else as they are typically understaffed or unable to complete multiple orders at once."}
{"text":"I drive by this plaza all the time and I was really looking forward to eating at this place when it finally opened. All I have to say is, a big disappointment. I understand that it's going to be busy because it just opened and that's natural. Everything seemed very unorganized. The menu is very hard to understand and doesn't give a lot of detail about their food. As we waited in line, one of the gals that worked there was passing out samples of their chicken taquitos. It just tasted like boiled chicken wrapped in a deep fried corn tortilla. Had absolutely no flavor. I ordered the bowl- rito, the rice was not even cooked all the way and I was spitting out hard bits and I was eating. My boyfriend ordered the California burrito. His order took 5 min longer to prepare because it was sent to the back for prep. He obviously was not happy about that. It was also a total disaster to eat, very messy. 
So, I'm just going to pas this place up and go to chipotle instead."}
{"text":"We are hooked!!! Came in for the first time today Unsure of what to really expect I can say... It maybe far from my house but I'm willing to make that drive!!!

Staff seemed friendly! And they didn't judge me out loud when I practically ordered one of everything on the menu! Ha!

We will be back time and time again! You guys need one of these Next door to my house!!! 
Thank you guys so much!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and a good price.  I had a burrito and my wife had quesadilla.  It was also in a very convenient location in the food court at the casino that was connected to the hotel."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch and it was AWESOME!  The food was tasty and well prepared, seriously yummy.  There was a slight hiccup when my bowl wasn't hot and the manager, Arthur, was on it!  He made me a new one and then gave us churros - which were like a happy party in my mouth.  Not only good, fresh food, but in a day when customer service is lacking, Arthur made certain that everyone in that restaurant was happy.  We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is great,but don't go on your lunch break they take forever to make a cheese quesadilla"}
{"text":"First time to eat here. In Phoenix for a long weekend workshop. Saw Chronic Taco while driving east on Peoria. Checked out the ratings and decided to give it a try. One order of chicken taquitos. They were stuffed with white meat chicken and delicious!! One grilled chicken wet burrito. Great flavor! Lots of choices for add ons. Guacamole was simple and flavorful.The crew on Sunday night were friendly, helpful and enjoyable to visit with!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was good. Just was kind of hard to get because the gal behind the counter had a tongue piercing and couldn't really hear me? But all that set a side, the Carnage asada ruled! CHRONIC TACOS! CHRONIC TACOS!CHRONIC TACOS!CHRONIC TACOS!CHRONIC TACOS!CHRONIC TACOS!CHRONIC TACOS!"}
{"text":"Havent had good tacos in a while. They have a wonderful taco 3 some deal I ended up going back to buy 3 more for dinner. The service is wonderful and the inside is beautiful. Very welcoming staff."}
{"text":"I had ordered online and did not have a good experience more than half the order was done incorrectly even after we repeated the order twice on the phone.. I did call back to let the young lady know the orders were wrong and I was wondering if I could get a discount for next time. The answer was no, and she just argued with me on how she new they did the order correctly?? The food was okay .. I would save yourself the trip and just go to chipotle. Plus the quality of the food is much better!"}
{"text":"I love Chronic Tacos' food, always fresh and well-prepared! My problem is the restaurant ALWAYS seems to close early. I've shown up several times ten minutes before the advertised 9 pm closing time, and the doors are already locked. So I spend my money nearby at Port of Subs, which also closes at 9 but actually stays OPEN until 9. Verdict: food great, customer convenience not so much..."}
{"text":"Shit show. Terrible service and Unorganized. Food was quickly prepared and tasted awful. We're from out of town but if your looking for a quick bite this isn't the place."}
{"text":"Got the bowl rito with 1/2 carne asada & 1/2 pollo asado. Got extra lettuce on it. Meat was flavorful and everything tastes fresh.

Service is what killed it for me. Middle-aged Asian lady who had been building my bowl for me asked me as I was paying, \"did you get fajitas veggies?\" I replied, \"no.\" And she said, \"because it's an extra charge. Are you sure?\" I asked her if she was accusing me of lying and then her other co-worker came over and I said that she can double check with her but I did not get the super fancy veggies.

I should not be treated this way just because the 3 ppl who work there are not organized. They should mark down if ppl get extras like guac or fajitas vegs if they are so concerned. Their system is flawed and their customers pay for it.

Wow been to chronic tacos many times in Newport Beach area and never have I had such a bad experience. I do not appreciate this kind of suspicious attitude towards the patrons here. Why should a hungry person who enjoys good tacos be treated like a criminal?"}
{"text":"The 1 star is due to the fact that my husband, myself and my friend arrived at Chronic Tacos at 8:55 tonight (Saturday) only to find the doors locked and the employees closing up. Employees saw us and didn't even bother to come out and offer an explanation. The lack of sign or explanation for being closed for more than an hour early is just bad business."}
{"text":"Last night I tried Chronic Tacos for my first time! AMAZING!! I'm hard to please! This restaurant had no problems pleasing me, especially with a menu with a large variety to select from, fresh ingredients, attentive staff that greeted me when I walked through the door, and I'm a stickler for cleanliness and it was definitely clean! I chose to try the El Pastor Taco! I have to say that's the best darn taco I have ever had! I'm visiting from Northern California and I wish I had a Chronic Taco near me! Great place that I highly recommend, again, I'm hard to please!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!

Great food! Great service!

The grilled fish and grilled shrimp tacos were amazing! As were the the breakfast chorizo tacos!

Customize it however you want. (Think Subway style) Fresh lime. Spicy jalapeños. Shredded cilantro. Great pico de gallo. Ghost pepper sauce that I'm going to have to buy some to take home.

Best food I've had while in Vegas and the fact that it is served so fast is a bonus."}
{"text":"Sadly was disappointed. 1st time here. I called first and was told all tacos were $1.99. Not true. I paid $4.60 for 1 fish taco. Almost $5?? For a street style taco?? It was decent but not worth the price. The line wasn't long when I walked in but I waited 10min till I was able to order. Young staff that didn't seem to be sure of who was doing what. Line was almost to the door by the time I ordered. Not sure if it's worth going back especially with Tacos and Tequila up the road with better prices. Big hype. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"First time coming here, the food was good but had trouble ordering. the menu is confusing and there should be better recommendations! The pollo tacos were good though!"}
{"text":"I wanted to break from the usual taco spot and found Chronic Tacos at the Palms. Everything was cooked fresh and delicious. The sauce options were fantastic and the service from the team was charming. I highly recommend Chronic Tacos!"}
{"text":"Just tried this new place in my neighborhood. Stoked for yet another place to eat out close to home. It was mediocre. The food lacked flavor and the guacamole needed salt and pepper. The staff was super nice and the place is very clean but the food didn't blow me away. It is a new location so I will give them the benefit of the doubt and allow for room for improvement as it always takes a new place a few months to get everything running smoothly. I will try it out again at some point and hopefully my second visit will inspire me to update this review."}
{"text":"This place is awesome fish tacos were so good and chronic fries are bomb and the employees are so friendly"}
{"text":"The Best Part of my vacation at Vegas was discovering Chronic Tacos at the Palms......The Tacos were Delicious"}
{"text":"Eh. I wanted to find a place where I could get a couple of cheap tacos and a beer so I gave it shot with the family. It wasn't bad, just nothing special. I would give it 2 1/2 stars if that was an option.

The food is okay. I had an al pastor taco and a carne asada taco, and I tried a few bites of my wife's chicken burrito. It was all just okay - can't say anything bad, but not really anything good to say either. I'd honestly rather hit Taco Bell, and I can think of 10 Mexican restaurants/taco shops in Vegas I would rather go to.

The staff was friendly, but a little unorganized. We were one of 3 other parties in the place and it kind of took awhile to get the food. Maybe the staff was new or something.

I get the whole graffiti thing and trying an alternative casual look, but it's a little over the top. Sharpie marker written all over the walls, rails, seats, and everything else that seems to be written mostly by teenagers wanting to be hard-core by dropping an F-bomb via permanent marker. Whatever.

If I happened to be in that shopping center and felt like a taco or burrito I might try it again, but not going out of the way to go back."}
{"text":"This place was so gross. I got the chicken tacos and it was so salty. I tried to like it but the salt was so overpowering. Not to mention it was 6-7 dollars for 2 small tacos!! I can get way better tacos and more than just two for that price! I will never come throw this money in the trash again. This place sucks. Oh yeah plus the tortilla was cold!"}
{"text":"The worst chronic taco I have ever been to! I ordered two burritos and the young man made a total mess, the contents of my burritos weren't even wrapped up! I told them their's no way I can eat that it's a total mess and if they can please remake them. The manager Emmi came up and grabbed the burritos from me and said she's refusing to serve me and I needed to leave. I asked them for the managers name, she said she wouldn't give me that information. I asked for corporates number she said no I'm not giving you that either. She gave me a complaint form and said I need to fill that out. No way I would fill that out just so she could throw it away. She was completely unprofessional and rude. I will definitely not being going there anymore. Perhaps the night manager thought I was a tourist but even if I was you do not treat your customers like that!"}
{"text":"Chronic my ass!!! This is the worst taco place I have ever been to. Thanks for wasting my precious lunch time. Rude and immature employees. I dare them call those pieces of crap tacos!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Stopped by while I was traveling and wasn't sure what to expect when I walked in (never heard of this restaurant before). To put it simply, I was blown away - not only with the food but also with their staff and overall vibe. I can usually find something to complain about but not in this case, everything was perfect. I wish they were located in my town because I'd be there all the time."}
{"text":"Since today it's my birthday yay!!!! my friend took me to try chronic tacos for the first time gotta say I was kinda hesitate cause all this bad reviews but try it anyways.. Best thing I ever did chronic fries on point delicious!!!!try me a shrimp tacos ahhhhh heaven on earth overall best fast food I had... Definitely my fav part of my bday.. Gotta come bak for more later.."}
{"text":"I've never wasted or thrown away food, but I couldn't event take a bite. Food smelled funny and was really not tasty or edible."}
{"text":"I ordered a bean and cheese burrito and the girl didn't melt the cheese at all or even warm up the burrito. She started wrapping up cold cheese and beans and I said are you not going to melt it and warm it up? And then she says we don't do that. What the...? I've never heard of eating a bean and cheese burrito like that. So gross !!"}
{"text":"The food flavor was decent, but like others reported it was a slow process to get it made. The main guy behind the counter wanted to make sure everyone knew he was an \"artist\" and that he knew the best way to top anything to make it look good.  It seemed to disappoint him that I had my own preferences for my toppings and did not turn him loose to make his vision.

At each step, he would stop and tell me about something he made before, or yell something back to the kitchen. When it was made, he moved on to another diner, explaining again how they are artists, while I waited for someone to ring up my food so I could pay and leave.

They did put a lot of toppings on, but it seemed to lack value for the price (out of cabbage, out of pico, big pile of wilted small diced lettuce). I would rather pay a little less and have a normal quantity of toppings and a more efficient / organized experience. I don't want to spend 15 minutes waiting for my food at a fast casual place."}
{"text":"Have eaten at the Palms location many times so my assumption was the freestanding restaurant on flamingo close to the 215 would be fairly similar. Boy was I wrong. I got the carne Assad tacos and they should have been called gristle tacos the meat was so tough I couldn't even chew it and it was mostly fat and gristle. Got my order to go and after the very short drive home when I unwrapped my food it was a nasty mess inside the bag. The girl who assembled my tacos wrapped them so tightly in paper that everything was mashed together. Definitely will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Tried it loved it...good food good customer service..better than chipotle (actual mexican food) must try if visiting las vegas or if local..
Ps:ima local so you guya got a permanent customer here"}
{"text":"I have to confess that I came in for a utilitarian meal experience.  I wasn't terribly hungry, but it was my only chance to grab some food for the night.  Chronic Tacos ended up being where my GPS took me.  I wasn't expecting anything grand, I just had to get a meal in.  My expectations were exceeded.  I opted for the Chronic Salad as I was not in the mood for anything overly heavy.  I had them fill the salad bowl with lettuce, beans, rice, chicken, cilantro, shredded cheese, and green salsa.  The chicken was so good!  It was flavorful, juicy, and tender.  The lettuce, beans, rice, cilantro, cheese, and salsa worked in concert with each other and provided good textural and flavor variations bite to bite.  I was very impressed and very pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"This review is for the owner.  The food is excellent but the manager of this place is mean and rude.  I love your food but I won't be coming back because of how you treat people there.  Sir you should be more aware of how your manager treats customers."}
{"text":"This is a great place for flavorful food and family gatherings. The owner is a layed back, Hardworking guy with plenty of employees that obviously work extremly hard to bring every single customer the satisfaction they deserve. THANK YOU BOBBY YOUR STORE IS FIRE!"}
{"text":"When I first saw this place, I thought it was going to be just another Chipotle. After trying it out, I have to say that the veggie burrito definitely outclasses Chipotle's burrito at size, flavor, and level of spiciness (you can leave out the hot sauce if spicy isn't for you). All in all, the price was definitely worth it for this meal.

My only complaint is that the dining area has some cigarette odor because it is in a casino, but that's outside of its control (and I walked into the casino to begin with anyway)."}
{"text":"Chronic Tacos has the same sort of layout as Willy's, but it is in no way as good as Willy's! The service is horrible, the prices aren't great and the food is not good. 

My boyfriend got a chicken burrito and I got a veggie burrito.. We weren't expecting too much because we had read the yelp reviews before going in there.. But they didn't taste nice at all and my veggie burrito had a piece of meat in it. 

Thats all... 

Id recommend walking 5 minutes down the road to El Taco Feliz!"}
{"text":"I liked it and thought it was pretty good. I had the 3 taco deal (2 chicken and 1 steak), and I enjoyed it. I would go to it again if it were a little closer to my home."}
{"text":"I had been waiting for this place to open since I frequently visit the palms, however, I was not at all impressed. The food was bland and greasy, the service was slow, and they don't take palms gift cards. I probably won't return, there are plenty of other places to eat in the casino."}
{"text":"Beer Battered Fish tacos with baja sauce!!
2 Fatty tacos & I'm done.. Chronic Tacos is pretty amazing."}
{"text":"So delish!!! The Carne Asada tacos were the bomb.com and the nachos were big enough for two of us to share. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Worst meal ever better in California location i came here thinking it would be good but no food was so salty i could not even eat overpriced and was really disappointed ill never return"}
{"text":"Updated review after an additional visit: 

The Baja sauce is still delicious, and did not disappoint either time. I got sautéed fish tacos Baja style on both of my visits... they could easily become a new addiction. The verde salsa is also tasty, but I'm still not a fan of the red salsa although I'm sure multiple others are. 

What turned my 3 stars into 5: 
1.) I respect the manager/owner for contacting me and addressing my initial concerns regarding the level of customer service. I feel he was sincere and expressed a true desire to ensure an exceptional customer experience by coaching his team on available opportunities. This alone added an additional half star to my initial impression, so a 3.5 at this point. 2.) they were not out of carne asada or any other menu items this time (I don't even eat it, but the other in my groups were disappointed when they were out) 3.) the team member behind the counter on my second visit offered a smile when we first came in and was very cordial, even confirmed my order by repeating it back to me. This added an additional half star, so we were at a solid 4 at this point. 4.) the tipping point- just as I was on my way out the door, thinking to myself that I'll update my review to reflect a 4- every team member who was not in the back, thanked us for coming in and wished us a good night. It sounds simple and it is, but it's significant and made the difference to me between 4 vs 5 stars."}
{"text":"Rating specifically on food... it could be better. It's just like another Chipotle or Zabas. Same concept. Overall though the place is very trendy and they have bar. Can't beat that. Food needs a little work."}
{"text":"I was really impressed when I went here with my family. When we first walked in we were immediately greeted with an enthusiastic hello. The staff was exceptionally helpful in making suggestions. They were very knowledgable about what was in their food and that was allowed me to make the best choices for me. The idea is you choose what you want (taco, burrito, nachos, etc) and then choose the toppings you want. However all of this was just the frosting on the cake. The best thing about chronic taco was their food! Their chicken tacos were divine. My refried beans with extra cheese was made perfectly. Their homemade chips and the medium Salsa- YUM! My favorite though had to be the Spanish rice. It was heaven in my mouth.. This was a favorite for my family and I will definitely be back for next weeks Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Chronic Tacos is absolutely amazing! From the culinary to the hospitality, they deliver a superb experience overall. You can truly taste the high quality of their food in every bit, which is at an exceptional price point. I promise, if you dine at Chronic Tacos, you will leave happy!"}
{"text":"We first saw Chronic Tacos in LA, but never got the chance to eat there. So, when I heard there was one in Vegas, my brother and I sought it out. The only way to get there from my side on town - the SW - is to risk your life via several roundabouts. I'm a skilled driver, but I despise those things. We made it in one piece without incident, phew.

Now give me food to calm myself.

Not able to decide on what I wanted, I ordered three tacos: fish, carnitas and carne asada. My brother tried the chicken and carne asada. We were the only people in the restaurant and the staff seemed highly annoyed by our presence. 

I grabbed a diet coke from the soda machine and it tasted terrible, flat yet it tasted only like seltzer. I couldn't drink it. I don't do regular soda so I was out of luck.

I dug into the tacos. The fish taco wasn't the worst I've had, but I wouldn't call it good. Edible. The Carnitas were the best of three. The carne asada was so salty. I about died. It was inedible. My brother agreed on the carne and thought the chicken was decent. 

I couldn't believe I risked my life on the roundabout deathtraps for this! Leaving, I was forced to gamble again. A few close calls, but we made it home safely. Thank goodness, I would not want Chronic Tacos for a last meal."}
{"text":"Had a potato taco and it was delish!! Quick service and friendly. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Chronic Tacos is like Chipotle but with far more choices including seafood.  They offer a wide variety of filling and sauce options.  I like the grilled shrimp burrito.  They also have a small bar area with decent beer prices as well as a patio were you can escape from the somewhat chaotic main dining area."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The staff and owner are always warm and inviting whenever we stop by for a fish burrito.  Which are amazing by the way!  Love coming here."}
{"text":"Mariah is great at making food and always smiling !! She's always working hard and doing awesome handling uber and the line!"}
{"text":"This is a nice option in the neighborhood. Love the sautéed shrimp tacos Baja style! Friendly staff, nice vibe! We have ordered online for quick pick up which is super convenient for take out."}
{"text":"Similar setup to Chipotle, but less \"big company\". The food (I got the Bowl-Rito, the hubby got a burrito, and we shared the Chronic Fries, all with carne asada) was good, and the toppings were plentiful and tasted fresh. The options were, again, similar those offered by Chipotle, though they taste slightly different. Service was nice and friendly, and fairly smooth considering how new the location is. You MUST try the Chronic Fries... They're as good, if not better, than the other reviews indicate. 

My only complaint is that the seating doesn't accommodate lots of small groups (i.e. 2 people) very well. It's currently better setup for larger groups, with big, curved booths and long tables, so it can get awkward asking to share a table. But maybe that says more about us anti-social Americans than it does the seating arrangements. :)"}
{"text":"Ate there today for the first time.  Awesome food and friendly, efficient staff.  Can't wait to go again.  Prices aren't bad either.  And they have my favorite \"free style\" coke machine."}
{"text":"Nice concept, nice staff. Unfortunately I had the beer battered fish tacos and can't get the fishy taste out of my mouth. I love fish but this was just too fishy. Combo with 2 tacos, chips and very small green salsa with regular drink came to $13. Think I'd pass on returning."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Chronic Tacos since I lived in the OC during undergrad. The selection and authentic recipes are so much better than Chipotle. I was in Phoenix visiting my brother when this location opened, and I'm glad to report that this place is as good as any I had in CA. Get the chicken burrito. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I walked in and immediately noticed the spotless lobby And was greeted by the employees. After a quick wait In line I was up to order. The friendly employee helped navigate the gate me through their menu and pushed me towards chronic fries. I got them with their perfectly grilled steak smothered with their Oaxaca cheese(Mexican mozzarella) and topped off with Pico, Guac, sour cream and their homemade spicy mayo (Baja sauce). It was amazing. Definitely recommend to everyone and will never set foot in a Chipotle ever again!!"}
{"text":"good food! subway type of style, as in you order a carne asada taco and you decide all the topings. Ive tried the chicken, carne asade, and al pastor. Stay away from the carne asada as a mexican whose had their share of great mexican restaurants this did not taste much like carne asada. But then again this isnt a true mexican restaurant so...Portions are HUGE beans and rice and yummy! Its a lil pricey but def worth it."}
{"text":"This place has great food, is always super clean, and has such a chill vibe. I've only had the carnitas and chicken burritos and both are delicious. My toddler enjoys the rice and bean sides they offer. One of my favorite places to eat. A+"}
{"text":"Love chronic tacos!! The main manager, I wish I would have gotten his name, is awesome! Great customer service and the food is delicious but inexpensive"}
{"text":"First timers! Atmosphere and decorations were pretty nice, but the food is average. When we visited, we were the only customers there so the staff seemed a little and prepare for us as we walked in. When the food was finally prepared, it seemed a bit rushed and processed. Overall the question is \"will your money be better spent elsewhere?\" For me, it would be."}
{"text":"Their food is really good. I usually build my own burrito when i go so i have not tried everything. The carne asada meat is delicious! 
Their service on the other hand is terrible. The employees do not have any sense of urgency. I would recommend more coaching on their roles and id love to see more confidence!! I will not being going in as often as i was because i do not like the service and the prices are a little ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"I gotta say I really love this place. However I'm really disappointed! I came in for lunch and you have the owner/manager? Walking around looking at the floors and dinning area, another lady walking around. You have two people making food and ringing up food total. One couple at the register 4 people in line and zero consistency! 15 min just to get a order in lol. What a joke!  If your doing cleaning and prep you jump in and take care of the customers then go back to cleaning. Place was pretty empty but took forever to get food and get out the door!  Just a side note. Why ask a customer what meat they want, then go back to the beginning to ask what rice and beans you want then go back and ask you what meat you want. It's a good line for a reason. Save time and keep moving.  This is my second time here in a week. Last time it was a lil slow and same questions but today just blew me away.  I have been to the Peoria location many times. The line and service was much better most all the time!!!
 Good luck guys. You will do well just please get the service together!!"}
{"text":"I just came to try their chronic frys and placed my order. I waited 15 minutes or more and found out they never put my order in. I got no apology or offer of a discount. I told them forget the order as I had to get back to work. They were so disorganized and did not know who ordered what and on top of that there was only one cook and 5 people on the assembly line.... I would have loved to try there food. I was denied frys from a food truck due to no asada meat so I came to Chronic Tacos....but to be denied again. I was forced to buy a lunch I did not want from another restaurant. I called the establishment to let them know how I felt... But of course their phone was busy. 

I visited this place in the past and enjoyed their tacos and had no issues before. This time I felt non important and I do not feel like returning. 

Don't expect a quick lunch if you don't order just tacos.

Update: The manager of the store did ended up contacting me back by phone after I left a complaint on the company's webpage. He offered me a free chronic fries. I appreciate the offer and them taking the time to get back to me. Maybe after some time I may give them another try."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place. The restaurant has always been clean when I visit, and really open and ambient.
The customer serve is decent but they could definitely be a little more friendly. While taking my order and making my food they carried on a personal conversation in between asking me what I would like on my burrito which I thought was a bit rude.
My burrito however, vegetarian burrito Baja style, was delicious. The burritos are very big and wrapped well. 
The restroom at the time of my most recent visit smelled of raw fish.
Overall this place is good and I will be back."}
{"text":"Second time here, just as good as the last. Even better actually since I had 3 beer battered shrimp tacos this time. Yes burritos and tacos aren't the most completed thing to make but they are easy to mess up. Chronic tacos know's what it's doing and does it right with big portions too."}
{"text":"The food is good but I will probably never go back. Way too expensive for the amount of food you receive. Ordered a small burrito with guacamole for $8, took 5 bites to eat, the guacamole was $1.59 for 1 scoop. With a family of 4 I'll pass."}
{"text":"OMG, the chicken Fatty Tacos are good....Good TV and I like the option of having fries with my Mexican food."}
{"text":"From crappy service to long waits to cold food. Just an all around bad experience. And I got home and my side of guacamole was missing  The food would've been decent had it been somewhat warm."}
{"text":"I order Carne Asada Burrito.
I received  Salty and sour Burrito. Sour meat and salty rice.
Over priced"}
{"text":"The food and portions were really good. The service was disappointing, this was my first visit and the two people at the counter did not smile and made me feel rushed (no one else was in the store). The food was 5 stars for the price, the service was a 2 star. For a restaurant that has the same theme as a much large chain, I would have expected amazing service to compete. I do not think I will be back."}
{"text":"Overpriced, unorganized,  corporate office doesnt know what the other hand is doing, tempe location recently shut down. Looking forward to the place that takes the peoria locations spot. Go eat at rolandos!"}
{"text":"So I'm from Cali & my expectations on Chronic tacos was different than what I received. I ordered through Grubhub so maybe there was a disconnect on my order. I was disappointed because it was basically just meat and tortillas and fries that I got in my order- not what I was expecting. I could've gone to filaberto's and had the same meal for less. I won't be coming back..."}
{"text":"It's kind of a cheap knockoff of chipotle. Got there at 11:30am for lunch. No carnitas.....what?  Was told it will be out in 2 hours. Who dropped the ball on that deal? Had to wait almost 10 minutes to order because the only 2 people working were making to go orders. We were the only people in line at this time. So no carnitas....tried the carne which was disappointing. I had to spit out 1/3 of the meat because it was all gristle and to tough to chew. Decent flavor though. Filled me up but definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I ahve gone here a few times. It is convienent when at work. The staff is great. Always friendly. Will answer any question. Make suggestions. 
The food is ok. I really like the refried beans. Love the guacamole and chips. Of the meats I tried they are all to salty for my taste. The prices are reasonable. You can get a complete meal for under 6.00."}
{"text":"Excellent food and reasonable prices. The sautéed fish tacos Baja style are the best. I only gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because the line can be confusing. It's totally worth it tho."}
{"text":"This place has great food I would of given 5 stars but been there a couple of times that food was driedbout or found a bone in the meat. Itherbten that they are clean and taste yummy. A little pricy for what u get but then again it's better then Chipotle and getting sick or dying."}
{"text":"I just tried this place the other night on a whim with my friend. We both ordered the tostada bowl, to go, with Carne Asada.  The place has a very different look to it. Funky decor. Young staff who were SUPER friendly and joking around with us. Very helpful and said hello the second we walked in the door.
The Tostada Bowl was EXCELLENT! It was so delicious. Nice cruncy shell, with all the fixings you want inside. Shell did not get soggy and stayed nice and crunchy. Highly recommend giving this place a shot. I am surpriesd by the mixed reviews, I thought this place was great!"}
{"text":"Chronic tacos is open. The location is inside of the Palms in the food court. The service was slow and they didn't add guacamole that was to of come inside of the potato taco. Workers are not friendly and I wish I would of ate somewhere else"}
{"text":"I am a regular customer. Tonight it was not good. The steak & chicken was very tough.
Now I know that one time does not constitute a bad restaurant but we notified the Mgr on duty of the situation & he did apologize & offer us some desert, but that wasn't acceptable since I paid $30 for inferior & inedible food.
I was very disappointed & most likely won't return..."}
{"text":"This is my third stop and each time the food has been excellent and plenty of it ... the restaurant has a nice appearance... the staff will offer suggestions if you are not sure what to get...the parking lot is usually full but additional parking is in back..."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. This place is horrible. We went about an hour and a half before they closed and we were the only ones there. Should have taken this as a sign to walk away. It started off with the worst service ever. The two girls behind the counter really could have cared less about impressing us. They didn't know anything about the food and if it contained lard or what was in it. I ordered the fajita veggies and waited about 10 minutes for the cook to simply grill up some bell peppers. No onions or anything. I was going to get guacamole but then looked at it and the entire container was black. I know it oxidizes but omg add some lime juice to it so it doesn't look like a bucket of crap. Needless to say, worst place ever. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Major letdown. .  the restaurant was nice, and clean, the staff was nice, but the food was sub par...far from being the chronic...
The food was barely warm and didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  Wish I would've went to robertos or chipotle.....I will not be back"}
{"text":"Stopped by to get a couple of Tacos at Chronic Tacos. Quick line, great employees, plenty of good food for the price and the place was very clean. Definitly on my list to go back to and tell my friends."}
{"text":"PASS! I was in the mood for Mexican food and on that side of town. One of the worst burritos I've ever had! The steak was too chewy and the whole thing didn't have much flavor. I didn't finish it. Also, there was one person working and she was very unenthusiastic, I could barely understand what she was saying. Any other place would have been better... Taco Bell filiberto's, Chipotle, anything."}
{"text":"Management. Help your workers out !  On a taco Tuesday one should NEVER tell customers that they are out of pico. I asked the server to please look in the back and with a roll of their eyes she begrudgingly went in the back and stocked up on more. Also PLEASE fix the cluster of how things are ordered. Why am I asked if I want to \"make it a meal\" at the end of the line where I pay only for the server to have to GO BACK and interrupt the whole line making process to fill my order of beans and rice. 

Decent food but service needs a revamp."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place so badly but this may be my last time here.

Customer service was lacking especially when it was obvious it was our first time. Few of the female workers just had blank stares waiting for us to decide what to order. The impatient vibe was definitely not welcoming at all. The only male worker was pretty friendly & suggested certain things for our meals. 

I was ecstatic to see Al Pastor since it's not very common so I ordered a bowl of that. Scoops of rice & meat were so little that my bowl was more of a salad full of lettuce drenched in salsa, cheese and sour cream. Al Pastor was also advertised as spicy & there was no spice at all. If anything, it was simply too salty. 

I ate half of my bowl & thank goodness I ordered chips cause I just ate that with little scoops of my soupy, drenched, salty \"supposed to be bowl but became a salad\" meal. 

Oh, there's a bar! But, I'd still rather just to go to my local favorite casual Mexican food place. I thought I'd find another alternative but I sadly didn't."}
{"text":"Just went to chronic. The tacos and Burritos are pretty decent!  It is better than Chipolte but not as good as cafe rio in my opinion. Not a bad choice tho!  I would recommend."}
{"text":"Just okay.  Not very good not very bad.  If you're into Chipotle then this is right up your alley.  Me?  I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch. Menu is self explanatory. It actually says step 1 and step 2. Basically, it's a build your own whatever kind of place. You have a choice of a taco, burrito, small burrito, quesadilla, burrito bowl, tostada bowl or a torta. Chicken, pork or steak are the meat options. Let me tell you, the meat flavor is what sets this place apart from the others. I ordered the spicy pork tostada  for me and a chicken taco for my friend. The meat is not dry and it really is tasty. Also comes with rice, beans, salsa, cheese. They had shredded Oaxaca cheese too!!
They play cool music and have day of the dead art on the walls. There's a reward program so sign up to accrue points. Staff was really friendly.
All in all a good spot nearby. I will definitely come back when I'm in the mood again."}
{"text":"Sadly my husband and I gave this a couple of chances. The first two times the owner was at the store and service was good and the food was hot and pretty good. The last two times we went...well not so bueno.
The first time there were suppose to open an hour before hand however the doors were still closed. They opened the door and there was already a line. And the employees grumbled while making the tacos.
This time no one was at the counter at first. Then the gentleman who came also appeared annoyed with being there. The tacos were to go and were not wrapped properly so all the ingredients fell out. The salsa lid wasn't closed so...soaked tacos. Yay...
Probably not going back."}
{"text":"It was ok. The price was reasonable food just ok and serving wasn't all that special."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have great menu with fresh ingredients and the customer service is excellent. I hope they open locations in the east valley soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for Taco Tuesday and ended up staying for a few drinks. The bartender Marcus made us one of the best Cadillac margaritas I've had in a long time. The Baja tacos with jalapeños were amazing. I'll def be back soon"}
{"text":"Decent food, cool decor, but extremely ineffective service. We used to come here frequently because it's close to our house....but we've regretted it every time.

This place is basically the same exact concept as Chipotle (a few different options) and the food is pretty comparable (not nearly as good) but the people working there are the slowwwwwesssssttt. It's essentially like if you were to hop in line at Chipotle at the busiest rush ever with 45 people in front of you, line out the door.....except there's never anyone IN LINE at Chronic. 

We've waited in line for (no exaggeration) 35+ minutes waiting to order when there was ONE person in front of us and just eventually left multiple times. They seem to prioritize their online orders so it's pretty common to just be standing in line without even being acknowledged by the people working while they gingerly take 9 1/2 minutes to add rice to a tortilla. 

 I thought Chronic Tacos was a cute name, but I'm pretty sure these employees are living up to the name and blazing to the fullest because they take a lifetime to fulfill an order and ask you the same question at least 8 times (\"what kind of beans do you want?\"...*five seconds later*...\"what kind of beans were those?\"....*four seconds later*...\"what kind of beans do you want again?\")...and they STILL manage to get it wrong every time. 

The last time I ate there I placed a to-go order for a veggie burrito w/ fajita veggies and guacamole....told them this when I ordered. Then when I got home and opened my burrito up, it was missing the veggies and guac. Sucks but whatever, I brought it back. Told the older lady who made my burrito (apparently she's the owner's cousin or something)...and her response is one of the reasons I will NEVER go back. 

She told me that if I wanted those things I should have REMINDED her the whole way down the burrito line. She REFUSED to make it right. I was like \"can you just open the burrito up and toss those things in or like rewrap it?\" Nope. It was my fault for not REPEATING my order for her incompetent self.

So make sure if you eat here, you plan to make a full night of standing in line and repeat your order a thousand times because it's all on you. But probably just don't eat here, Mi Pueblo up the street is fantastic anyway."}
{"text":"Long wait in spite of having a short line and four people working behind the counter.  They were not organized and it felt a bit chaotic.  I only ordered a salad and I waited in line for 15 mins.  Ridiculous for average Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for a few years now, but I'm really disappointed.  I ordered chicken flautas.....I got greasy beef flautas! WAY too greasy! 

Plus, I ate my food as I sat at a slot machine, because every table in the small food court area was full. Seems like Palms is long overdue for a redesign of that portion of the casino."}
{"text":"I love Chronic Tacos! I sometimes go there at lunch because I work nearby. It's right by Chipotle, and is similar to Chipotle. However, I'll often choose Chronic over Chipotle because Chipotle generally has horrendous lines at lunch. I also like that chronic has al pastor. 

When I go, I like to get 3 tacos al pastor. I like their selection of authentic Mexican cheeses. I like that they offer cabbage as a topping. I like that guacamole is free with tacos! 

The employees are friendly and helpful.  The atmosphere is laid back. 

Mmmm, my mouth is starting to water! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It's like Chipotle but waaaay better food. I had a quesadilla with Al Pastor. Staff was super nice also. Plenty of food for the price."}
{"text":"This place sucks! The food was extremely cold...my husbands beer was pored with about 75% foam...the server had to empty the glass and pour like 4 times....very skimpy on the cheese and everything else...but most importantly..the tortillas were so cold, not heated enought that they ripped  apart...this gives a lot of supposed to be authentic taco shops a bad rep....being mexican, I will strongly advise to go to those \" hole in the wall \" joints for authentic mexican and hot food."}
{"text":"My second trip to chronic taco and all I can say is that we were all definitely underwhelmed!.  The carnitas were so over cooked you had to gnaw on the pieces of meat.   The fish in my fish taco was completely dried out.  We ordered a cheese crisp and the girl didn't clean old melted cheese off the press before she put in our cheese crisp.   Gross. Finally,  the whole time we were in line the two girls assembling the meals were throwing food trimmings etc at a trash can and food was splashing and spraying everywhere.  If any of us gets food poisoning tonight I won't be surprised.   We should have walked out.   This place was totally disgusting tonight and will never see my business again. NO STARS NO STARS"}
{"text":"Didn't know until today that we had this in town so I decided to give it a try. Had the carne asada burrito meal. The burrito was good,but better once I put some hot sauce in it, the chips were better by themselves than with the salsa. This is better than Roberto's, but I'm not going out of my way to come here and eat.
Had a very \"Bro\" vibe, awkward."}
{"text":"This place was okay. I came in for taco Tuesday ($1 off tacos), which is a pretty good deal. Tacos are usually 3.99 there. They were actually pretty big tacos. I was expecting them to be the smaller street tacos at the more authentic restaurants. You don't have to pay extra for guacamole which is nice. The service was eh. The lady that made my taco wasn't very friendly and she gave me a fish taco instead of the shrimp that I asked for, but it wasn't a big deal so I just ate the fish one. The fish didn't taste very fresh but I liked how it was prepared \"baja style\". The carne asada in my other taco was slightly cold and tough. I think my favorite was the chicken, which had good flavor. 

The restaurant itself was very clean."}
{"text":"My favorite quick service place for Taco Tuesdays. $1 off tacos.  Chicken and carnitas are my favorite. And guac is included!  And supposedly, no hormones nor antibiotics added, and non gmo."}
{"text":"Fresh shrimp tacos - I saw the guy saute the shrimp myself - served on a steamy warm corn tortilla with my kind of hand fulls of cilantro, onion, cabbage and tomatillo sauce... mmmmmm, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The burritos are huge! And the green salsa is amazing! The owner recommended that I try it and I'm so glad I did. Service was fast and friendly. My daughter and I were sitting enjoying our meal and the owner gave us some free churros for dessert! I highly recommend this place if you have a fixing for some quality Mexican food!"}
{"text":"One word: Gross.

What's your reaction when you order sour cream for a taco and see it piped from a bag? I almost refused to receive it. Chips were stale, too. Just about anything on it was gross - I regretted my decision to get out of our routine of ordering at Earl of Sandwich."}
{"text":"Have been here once before and the food was pretty decent. Today, however, was a different story. Don't know if maybe they are trying to save money by cutting portions or what but I literally received a snack sized portion but paid for a full sized bowl. $7.50 for a spoonfull of beans, rice and meat. Won't be going back.

UPDATE: Apparently a manager read my review and is accusing me of eating half my bowl and then posting a picture of it. The picture was taken right when I got home and took the lid off. You can clearly see the unbroken layer of melted cheese on top of the meat . The entire portion slid to the side enroute to my house. They put the rice in first followed by the beans then the meat. How could I eat any of it without breaking the melted cheese?"}
{"text":"As a Mexican, I am legitimately entitled to judge tacos most accurately. Chronic taco was delicious and had a perfectly sized menu and great staff. 

Derrick and Otis were doing frontline and made my experience AMAZING. I would come back just because of them."}
{"text":"We were there yesterday for the first time, and the experience was not the greatest. 

I ordered: 1 fish taco and 1 carnitas taco
My bf ordered: 1 fish taco 1 carnitas taco 1 carne asada taco 
And my son got the kids meal with a carnitas taco and an additional side of fries. 

The first time around the lady gave me a shrimp taco instead of the fish. I explained to her I wanted fish not shrimp. She apologized and put the new order in. Then she approaches my bf to prepare his shrimp taco. Again we explained that he wanted fish not shrimp. She apologized again and put a new order. I go to the bathroom and come back. By then my boyfriend is at the table with 2 out of his 3 tacos(they were making his new fish taco). Than my fish taco came out, we prepared it, and I walk to the table only to realize THEY FORGOT MY CARNITAS TACO! My bf goes to the counter and asks for my taco, she apologizes yet again and puts the order in. By now we are pretty much over it. But than we realized my bf and son didn't get their chips and salsa for his combo and kids meal...... Did I mention WE WERE THE ONLY ONES IN LINE? How did our order get this mixed up? 

The tacos were pretty tasty, even my son that only wants to eat cheeseburger and fries liked it. Which is why I'm giving this place 3 stars. But I'm not sure we will be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Waited forever for my fish tacos. They made them but kept on taking care of other people so the fish got cold before I even got my taco made. The cook in the back knew it and threw them back on to heat up a bit. I like the food, but was not a fan of the service this time."}
{"text":"Food was pretty gross. I got the carne asada tacos super salty, mad that I wasted a cheat day on my diet here"}
{"text":"I was disappointed by this place. Although the food was certainly good, the food is WAY over priced considering the small portions. $3.25 for a street taco? C'mon. There are a half dozen other street taco places around here that are better for less. I loved the reggae music though!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to tacos after a night out clubbing.  The food is prepared right in front of your face (Chipotle style).  I had high hopes when I saw the tortillas being warmed on a griddle, but man, Chronic Tacos fell short.  The meat is super greasy and the tortillas are too thick.  Definitely not fresh.  They do give you a lot of meat and topping options.  Two tacos (carne asada & carnitas) cost just south of $8.  I was reaaaally craving Mexican food, but these just weren't worth it.

PS: We were the last customers before they closed.  Apparently the tacos don't come with chips, but I think it would've been a nice gesture to add some to the meal when they're just gonna throw them out anyway."}
{"text":"Oh man. Words can not describe how happy I am that we finally have a Chronic Taco. 

Not only is this place a cool place, the fish tacos are so GD good it makes me want to slap your mother. Two Beer battered fish tacos, baja style and you're ready. 

Don't miss out. What else are you gonna do? Eat at Del Taco. Go ahead fart knocker."}
{"text":"I've become a regular here since the food is made to order, good portions, and you leave full without the greasy feeling you get from many other places around town.  There's also various specials throughout the week and my favorite is Torta Thursday where you get a free drink and chips. 

So far I've had tortas, fish tacos, and breakfast burritos but must admit the fries look pretty amazing topped with meat and cheese.  What I really enjoy is choice of tortillas, grilled or fried fish tacos, and every step of preparing your order is asked for input from you.  I also love that when I'm taking a break here during the work week I can also grab a much needed Rockstar that they keep in stock in multiple flavors."}
{"text":"I really like this place it's my first time coming here and they really treat you with respect. The food is excellent. They gave me free churros when I finished my food so I can enjoy my beer while I watch their tv. I really recommend it to people that are craving Mexican food."}
{"text":"Idk what the big deal is.. everyone says it's so good but I just don't see it. Maybe it's my fault for NOT getting tacos. The nachos had cold cheese (and not enough) and the burrito was big, sure, but nothing special.. not even homemade tortillas. No reason to go back."}
{"text":"Took this place as a cross between Chipotle and Tijuana Flats. Food was good. Seems like the staff is either brand new or poorly trained. The manager was on top of everything behind the line, but everyone else seemed distracted and didn't care. Garbage cans were overfilled and about to spill onto the floor."}
{"text":"Went too Chronic at the Palms Hotel today.
$13.29 for 2 Carne Asada Tacos and a original mexico type Coca Cola.
The price is fine if the food is great and it was awfulness at it's worst. About half the Carne Asada meat was all fat & connective tissue.
Yuck!!
No thanks I will just go back to Robertitos where I know what too expect.

If this was not in a hotel food court they would have hung the closed out of business sign ling ago.

I don't understand it, how the one up the road in the Summerlin area can be great and this one sucks!!"}
{"text":"We were worried that this place would disappoint just like a good movie that is hyped up to much! Friends have been talking about Chronic Tacos so much that I was sure to not have high expectations and be disappointed. Since we do not live close, we had to plan this trip when visiting friends. It was soooooo dang good and will drive the 40 minutes to go again with friends! The meats, adobada, carne asada, beans etc etc were all on point! We all had burritos and they are huge and good. We really really need a Chronic Taco in the East Valley!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you...I have never met a taco I didn't like. I'm pretty taco obsessed. However, I have to tell you that I avoided this place from when it opened until just a couple months ago, all because I hated the name. What.A.Mistake.

Now, let me be upfront and honest, I have been here a handful of times and I always order the same thing. Potato Tacos. OMG, they are so good. Mashed potatoes in a taco shell, deep fried, topped with all of of your favorite toppings (I go the cheese, cilantro, onion, cabbage, salsa verde route). Only once have I been disappointed, they were cold in the center, but that won't stop me from returning. 

The menu is pretty extensive and everything looks really good. They even have breakfast burritos for the morning crowd, but I am unsure of what time they open. Service is friendly and quick and I'm pretty sure they have beer specials.

Definitely worth checking out. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Horrible service and nor reasonably priced for mexican fast food. The staff in my opinion are not properly trained to serve the public and were in each other way the whole time I waited on cue to order. While ordering I was notified that they were out of Carne Asada so I got chicken Tacos which were gross. I also ordered the combo and then I was notified that there was no soda to go with my combo? Worst $10 I ever spent. It's the new store in metro center on Peoria Ave. They definitely have some kinks to work out."}
{"text":"When I initially walked in I thought it was a bootleg chipotle but as I took my first bite I realized chipotle was a bootleg chronic tacos lol"}
{"text":"This place ugh..... I wasn't even able to finish my tacos as the meat didn't seem to cooked at the correct temperature. I will not return."}
{"text":"I had the tacos, spicy al pastor and regular carnitas. They were absolutely delicious. My fiance had the burrito which was huge. The owner was very nice and professional. We also had the min churros. The music they played topped it off as a great place. REGGAE which is my favorite!!"}
{"text":"My kids and I entered and stood in line to choose our proteins, etc. This restaurant is very reminiscent of Chipolte. One difference between the two is that seafood is on the menu here. I ordered two beer battered shrimp tacos. They were served on two layers of cold corn tortillas. I chose my toppings after helping assist my children with their orders, then we sat down with our foods. One issue immediately... Onions on the kids' steak taco meals. The beef is cooked with diced onions. Sautéed onions could easily been seen on these small soft tacos. I don't know about other families, but my younger children are repelled but just the sight. I spent a few minutes removing them from their meals only to find many more in their sides of refried beans. It took some coaxing, but I got them to at least eat their tacos. I found my food rather cold at this point... But I grabbed some hot salsa and started eating. The shrimp tasted pretty good. However I am a TexMex fan and like my tacos heavy seasoned with flavor. These tacos were rather mild and lacking in flavor... So was the salsa. :( this fifty dollar chronic taco outing was a bust in my book.  If I do give this Chipolte wannabe restaurant another chance it will for sure be without my onion hating kiddos."}
{"text":"Well I can only give it a 1/2 star because the girl that made our food was nice. Tortillas were not even warm, meat was fatty, beans were cold, cilantro lime rice was like rocks real crunchy and no flavor. Don't get the meal with chips, they were ice cold not fresh chips. This was a real disappointment! Love the name and that's it! Will not go back."}
{"text":"Attempting to do a lunch run for my place of work, no one answered first time I called, called back and was told there were other customers please hold, placed phone on counter, left on hold for a few minutes then someone hung up. Not the first time I have called and got no answer. Food is good service sucks!"}
{"text":"Their fish tacos (baja style) are the best I've ever had. However, I didn't really like their pork tacos that much."}
{"text":"Great burritos.  Service was good &  now we have a place to eat after seeing a movie."}
{"text":"We stopped in for Taco Tuesday and was not disappointed. The carne asada and the carnitas were our favorite! Service was fast and friendly for us. A little pricey overall but, with a taco tuesday discount it was on point for us."}
{"text":"Ate a quick lunch here since I was staying at the Palms. Being from Los Angeles, tacos are a cheap, tasty way for a quick meal. I realize this place is in the food court of a resort, but yikes, my wife and I each had two tacos, a coke and a beer, and the bill ended up being a little over $30. For what you get and the quality of the tacos, it's way overpriced. The asada tasted more like it was boiled and my wife said the pastor was dull and bland. My wife and I knew there was something wrong when they asked us what kind of cheese we wanted on our tacos. Cheese? Where are we, Taco Bell?"}
{"text":"I love chronic tacos. But I ordered a to go order and wanted my toppings on the side. The topping sides are so small compare to my mound of nachos. They combined my husband and my lettuce into one. And I'd finish the guacamole I spent over a dollar extra on in two bites. Very disappointing how the to go orders are packaged."}
{"text":"I went into Chronic Tacos this morning (Memorial Day) When we walked in there were 3 employees there all talking. When we came in we asked if they were open because there is no hour of operation signs anywhere. The lady, what I assume to be the manager said \"yes we are open for breakfast burritos\" 

Wonderful that's what we were there for. We go up to the counter and the girl behind it has no idea what is going on. We asked if they were open again and she just stood there and looked at us. Then, the manager yells across the store \"yes we are open for breakfast burritos\" 

As we are trying to order these said breakfast burritos the girl behind the counter says you can pick your cheese and lettuces and onions. After the 2nd time of asking her what is on it meat wise the manager (from across the store again) starts telling us what we can do with the burritos. 

At that point the girl behind the counter still has no idea what is going on. I give up, I know longer want a burrito. My fiancee decided to still get one. Their only 2 meat choices.That's it. 

After this interesting experience, the burrito was not very good. 

Not a bad experience, i guess, but definitely a VERY uncomfortable one.







****update reply to manager -- 

We asked numerous times if you guys were open, and numerous times we were told you were. A simple \"we are not open\" would suffice"}
{"text":"I've seen these all over So. Cal before, but never tried it til they opened one here in Summerlin. It was pretty cool since it was my first time and their first time actually opening.

It kinda has this Baja thing to it. IDK if it's cus the people actually making our food weren't mexican at all or because they had these skateboards hanging on their walls. And while you're waiting in line, they let you tag up the walls. Gives it this friendly kinda vibe for some reason.

I've tried their carne asada tacos and their carnitas burrito. The carne asada tacos were pretty decent. The carnitas were really sweet and juicy. They have Monday specials 5 dollar burritos and Tuesday tacos! 

The service is quick and friendly. They always greet everyone at first step in the door. And the parking is plenty unless its a Sunday. Sunday is the busiest I've seen it."}
{"text":"I had out of town guests visiting and needed to order dinner that everyone would like- vegetarians and meat-eaters, adults and picky kids- that wouldn't take long. I put in the order online and left the house at the time I was notified my order would be ready (7:35 pm). When my friend and I arrived (around 7:40 pm on a Thursday) there were only a few diners and a maybe 3 people/groups in line to order. 

We waited a few minutes before letting someone know that we were picking up, and were told our order wasn't done yet. We were given 2 cups for soda since we had to wait, which was thoughtful, but we then proceeded to wait a full 30 minutes before our order was done! 30 minutes in addition to the time between ordering online and going to the shop to pick up. The order was for 5 items and was in no way complicated, but we were repeatedly told that our order wasn't done despite staff moving through multiple orders of both in-person and pick up orders while we waited. Staff was highly disorganized and I saw them start orders and walk away from them multiple times. One person waited so long for her order that it was cold, but she chose to take the food rather than have it prepared from the beginning because she knew it would take even longer to get her food (I know because we were commiserating together while waiting).

When we finally received our order, which included 3 burritos, nothing was labeled (1 was for a vegetarian so we couldn't just start eating and see whose was whose) and multiple orders were missing components (salsa, sour cream, etc). Also, not surprisingly, everything was cold. The food wasn't even good!

This was my first and last time ever going to a Chronic Taco. The service was terrible and the food wasn't even worth the ridiculous wait time. Next time I'll stick with Chipotle."}
{"text":"I really don't like to rate places but this place really sucks.. I had to wait 25 minutes for 2 fish tacos, for $11 dollars they are the worst tacos ever. Plus the cook was worried more about changing hood vents than cooking.. All around just bad service and food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their options. I'm used to the \"white or brown rice\" and \"black or pinto beans.\" They offered white or Spanish, the Spanish rice was delicious. They offered black or refried, and oh girl, that refried was so good. I got the Al Pastor, and it was okay. I enjoyed my lunch but wouldn't have picked it again."}
{"text":"Feels like Chipotle. Food was tasty and the portions were generous for the price. 
Everything was good, just nothing stood out as outstanding. Don't get me wrong, no complaints about the food. Good portions, quality ingredients, zesty spices. Just nothing super unique. 
I'd rather go here over Chipotle the next time I'm craving carne asada tacos or burros. But I didn't taste anything that has me running right back. 
Like I said, food was solid: fresh, tasty. Service could have been a little faster, considering the size of the team behind the counter. I spoke to no less than SIX team members to get a burrito and quesadilla. Time to streamline tasks, chronic tacos!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great Mexican street style food, full bar, awesome friendly people. If you're in the west side of Las Vegas make sure you check out Chronic Tacos!!!"}
{"text":"If you accidentally make it to your movie with 30 mins to spare and don't want to spend an arm and a leg at the concession stand.... Then stop and spend an arm and a leg here instead! Don't get me wrong food taste great, but $12 for the amount you get? I was mesmerized by the ad standing between me and the theater for  fish and shrimp tacos. I thought it would indeed include fish and shrimp, it includes fish OR shrimp. So I ended up with both. They took. a while to make, which is ok... Because I like my seafood as fresh as possible. I also decided to make it a meal which includes rice(white or Spanish) and beans (refried, pinto or black), chips and salsa and a fountain drink. I had a huge issue with the presentation. They don't have a box or tray if you order a meal and plan on eating in the food court. Picture this.... I'm carrying an open faces box with my tacos, two containers with my beans and rice, a container of salsa, a bag of chips and an empty cup! Luckily I have a juggling background of cocktail server, but cmon... Seriously? How hard is it to put a meal in the correct packaging? Work on it people!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here all the time. I'm addicted to it. They make our orders perfect attending to my excessive cheese obsession and even on the rare occasions something goes wrong or it gets busy ,they always apologize, give free upgrades, and what not. It's great. The employees are great. I know someone else mentioned they like seeing the diversity which I definitely agree with as well in terms of letting the employees keep their piercings and show tattoos. It's refreshing and gives a welcoming,inclusive atmosphere. :)"}
{"text":"Was hoping that the tacos were better, but not worth the $4 per taco.

I'm staying at the Palms for a conference and needed a quick bite. Ordered the grilled fish and grilled shrimp tacos.

The lady who took my order was great. Friendly, helpful and let me know when the food would be ready. I got the tacos Baja style (cabbage and sauce). The fish taco was okay (3/5) but retangular fish portions? At least it flaked like real fish. The shrimp taco was disappointing (2/5) as there was like 3-4 shrimp. The cabbage and sauce would make most things tasty, but wanted more seafood for the price. 2.5 Star.



I might try it out one more time, but will try the Earl sandwich place first."}
{"text":"When I go into restaurants they all start with 5 stars. As the fall short they lose a star. So I Tried this for the first time today. Cool looking concept. I base a lot of my first impressions off of the smells that the food gives when you first walk in. However, there was no smells. None other than cleaner. That's where they lose the first star. Then I go to order. Everything is ala cart. Which is fine in most places but almost 4.00 for a taco?!?  That's insane! At those prices the food better be amazing. Which brings me to their second loss of a star. The food was mediocre at best. Nothing that separates them from their competition like chipotle or cafe Rio. They're using a commodity corn tortilla that has a weird after taste. The carne Assad is tough and chewy. As is their adobada. They lose their third star with the sides. The retried beans have no flavor. No salt. No pepper. No trace of onion Or any other herb or spice. Very blan. As was their black beans. The sad thing is, the best item I had was a deep fried potato taco. Alone, it would probably match the rest of their items, but I dressed it in enchilada sauce and smothered it with cheese. It was actually pretty good considering it was the cheapest item on my ticket. 

At the end of the day, this is your typical franchised chain restaurant. Service was ok. I was told everything is made in house. But I expect more from homemade items. Cafe Rio offers homemade everything, including tortillas. If this place wants to succeed, they're gonna have to step up their game. Food like this may work in California, but in Arizona they'll have to bring more than what they have now."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in the Palms food court as the sole Mexican food option, right next door to the movie theater. Here's a secret: stop by for tacos and smuggle them in to your $5 movie on Mondays. If you get caught though, I don't know you...

Fish tacos are just over $3 and are available grilled or fried Baja style. Either way is good, but the potato taco is kind of the cult favorite here. Here's what makes the tacos worth the price though: you can add on all the extra toppings you want, for free.
That means lettuce and cabbage and four kinds of salsa, tomatoes and peppers and cheese, oh my! And, yes, ladies and gentlemen: guac. Without a $2 surcharge. 

Service is pretty standard, and nothing here will really blow you away, but the tacos are made fresh and there's guac, so..."}
{"text":"I will recommend anyone to this place. Their burritos are amazing and all of the food is nice and fresh.  All staff are very nice and welcoming. They give you time to order and know what they are talking about. Try it out for yourself! Chronic Tacos, it's not Filibertos."}
{"text":"My fella and I had the pleasure of checking out your establishment this past Friday. We heard not so great things and wanted to decide for ourselves. The amount of food vs price was overly reasonable. The steak left a bit to be desired. However, our main enjoyment and draw to come back in future was because of an employee named Joey (sp). He's a wonderful soul with honesty, a great attitude and a love for his job. He does some special flourishes with the limes and sour cream which were fun to watch. We would love to return."}
{"text":"I went in expecting this place to be as amazing as Facebook had hyped it up, but was ultimately disappointed. Prices were pretty high, flavors were blah, and their hottest salsa was something a 3 year old could tolerate. Even with all that in mind, I still wasnt going to leave a bad review.
HOWEVER, when I got home and reheated my pollo asado fries the next morning, I found a HUGE chunk of foil mixed in near the bottom of my fries. It didn't come from the foil tin they gave me, because it was much flimsier than that, more like sheet foil to cover food up. I could see if a piece fell on top, but this was cooked in between my fries and beans. Luckily I didn't bit on it or that wouldve been an end for my teeth. Super disappointed.
Not sure how to add photos to a review, but I posted them up with the rest of the pictures."}
{"text":"At first we were stoked to find Chronic Tacos. Honestly we've never been in the store but have ordered from Postmates several times. The first couple times were perfect - the first time I ordered my burrito wet style because who doesn't love more enchilada sauce, and the person who made my burrito was aware enough to not put cheese on it as I didn't order any inside my burrito and forgot to add a note asking for just sauce on top. Five stars for them!  The last two times however my order has been wrong and left me hungry. My husband's over there happy as a clam with his fries and I'm super bummed eating a dry burrito missing multiple ingredients.  I don't completely blame the Postmate as the order should be ready and correct so they can get out of there and on their way asap. And twice in a row is a big red flag for me. It seems like either there needs to be a revamp of how the online orders come in or more quality control in place when checking orders. 

**UPDATE: after corresponding with Robert on Yelp, he advised me to call and reference our discussion for a free meal to try again. I just tried to order a meal via phone and was advised to call back in 15-20 minutes when an owner \"should\" be available. After all of Robert's promises of putting customers first, this is SO disappointing. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Taste was meh. Service was meh. Price was way higher than any of it warranted. If you're going to spend that kind of money, you might as well go someplace worth it or if you just really want tacos/burrito/salad, Chipotle is half a block away."}
{"text":"Everything was fine as I expected.
Food: good
Price: good
Service: good
Parking: good

Located in the food court. 
Good place to go before or after watching a movie."}
{"text":"Chronic Tacos ROCK! My husband and I dropped in because we were craving a quick fix for Mexican food and was surprised by how delicious the carne asada nachos, guacamole, salsa roja and verde were. We also tried the carnitas and chicken tacos. Those were alright, too. The price was definitely affordable, and the food hit the spot."}
{"text":"Bubonic chronic tacos!

The LA area based taco shop has berthed a brand new face on the scene with their rock-n-roll persona with a twist of eats from south of the border! A few friends and I went to their grand opening week and sank my teeth into their carnitas (pork) burrito. Places like Chipotle, Zaba's, and Qdoba have similar recipes, but the there are some difference that make Chronic Tacos stand out:

Spanish red rice-- Chipotle doesn't have different choices for rice, Zaba's has brown rice, and Qdoba doesn't have a variance in their rices. But Chronic has Spanish rice! :)

Carnitas-- marinated pulled pork! It has a sweet taste to it that I haven't tasted before!

Flautas-- deep fried taquitos! Ask for Baja sauce and enjoy!

If you're looking for a taco joint with style, personality, and character Chronic Tacos packs it all into their joint! Last I heard of from one of the managers is that they're opening up the bar side of the restaurant soon so look out for that. And if you call an order in, ask for Tony. He's got good customer service!"}
{"text":"Love the Chronic Tacos...delicious fresh food, friendly staff & manager! Great value of your looking for a new place for a quick bite. Was a little difficult to order food through/over the glass barrier (especially for kids)."}
{"text":"Came in today for lunch and waited 36 minutes in line. I know specifically how long because I took a phone call when I walked in and when I finally got to the front looked back to see when it was. The staff was not trained properly but no one was on the line directing them, they definitely had enough hands just not using them to their advantage. I.e. 3 people on toppings and 1 setting up tacos/tortillas. The girl would never use the second warmer she would wait for the first tacos to be warm before starting another. This was the biggest reason why it took so long to get through the line. I watched people walk out. After all that wait I wanted a grilled fish taco and had to wait again because it came from the back. The barrier is too high and you had to yell over it and repeat what you wanted so they could hear you. I also ordered a carnitas taco and the carnitas meat was very dry and chewy like it sat on the line for too long. I know they are new so I will try again in a few months but they need to get it together... And quick."}
{"text":"Staff is extremely well versed in what they offer and very friendly! Fresh, fresh, fresh food with a great kick. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but the service was extremely poor and the food was not good enough to overcome that shortcoming."}
{"text":"I had wanted to try this place for a while because it looked so inviting,  the murals,  bar etc. Stopped in on a Friday evening around 5 and it was empty.  The guy working behind the counter was friendly and helpful and I got the steak burrito. Here's were things go south.  The meat was cold and had gristle, so much so I spat some out. Eww. The tortilla was cold and chewey, lacked flavor and anything remarkable.  I wish the food matched the decor or the friendly service.  Those are the only 2 reasons I'm giving it 3 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place! Some awesome burritos. I usually get the carne asada and it is always great.  Everything is made right in front of you so you know exactly what is going into your burrito, or tacos. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is always clean.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"They got our entire order wrong, the only thing they got right was the chips and guacamole. Then the manager refused to talk to me over the phone to help correct the problem."}
{"text":"I went here one Sunday afternoon after church and the food was good. I think they were a little stingy on the meat for my burrito unlike  qdoba but I was full so I guess that's all the matters ultimately. I had my 2 year old with me and don't recall any kid seats for him to sit in. I'd go back again though. It was a nice place to sit and have tacos"}
{"text":"This was my first visit of the establishment. I have mixed feelings about it. I was craving a burrito and thought, why not? Let's check it out! I get there, and the place looks clean and not too busy. There was a family ahead of me. It seemed as tho the employees were having a hard time with their orders. One was having a hard time rolling a burrito (which I understand, I can't even do it myself) and the other one you can tell was overwhelmed and not listening. It was my turn up at the line to tell them what I wanted. The lady asked and I told her a burrito. I had to repeat myself twice, because she wasn't paying attention and having conversations with employees around her, ok, fine. Then she asked me what kind of chicken, I answered twice. She wasn't listening. Again, she was having conversations with over people around her. That annoys me if I have to repeat myself often. So, I continued with telling her all the things I wanted. I asked for salsa on the side, and I didn't get that, eye roll. Based on the experience so far, I was going to give them a 1 star. Then, I tried my burrito and it was good! I would come back here again and see if the customer service experience is better and maybe change my review then. But for now, they're just a three.

*** I received a message on here from the man who is the owner of the establishment. Because of his message, this place is barely a one star and I will not return and here's why. He messaged me trying to tell me that the person who was serving was hearing impaired and was going to quit because of my review. That's odd, because one, I never gave a name of the person I was referring to in my review, how would he know? And two, the person was clearly capable of hearing her co-workers around me. Hearing impaired is not selective hearing. The owner asked me to re-word my review. Not once did he take ownership. Instead he shifted blame and attempted to bully me. He didn't have the facts and nor did he have a clear understanding of the person I was describing in my review. I'm disgusted with the place now.

***** The owner continued to message me and harass me and continue to explain that the lady is hearing impaired. He yet has a clear understanding of the employee I was discussing. Therefor, he still doesn't know who I'm referencing. The employee could not have recognize me since I've been there once and that was what, a couple weeks ago? Out of alllllll the customers that comes in, she recognizes this transaction? Please tell me, what is that I got in my order since she seems to have a clear understanding of was exchanged during that moment. If someone is hearing impaired, yes that's a serious disability. However, the lady was not. She was able to listen to those around her and tell people what to do. My original review wasn't bad it was three out of five stars. O would have given this place another chance. However, the owner continued to give a blanket statement and say the employee is hearing impaired. He has no idea who I'm talking about. No names were exchange. The lady was busy trying to help other fix an order that they messed up on. My issue what about how it was addressed. There was no, thank you for being patient, thank you for your time, one moment please. No customer skills. The owner continues to badger me and say the employee is hearing impaired. That WAS NOT MY ISSUE. He continued to message me in regards and never accepted my root issue. Him messaging the way he did, was completely out of line. He did not take ownership of the customer service skills."}
{"text":"how is a carne asada taco greasy ?!? and most of the meat was salty and mostly fat !! cold tortillas that fall apart . my friend had the chicken bowl and was not impressed . chicken tasted funny . limes were old and dry . no idea what the talk about this place is"}
{"text":"Great service! Walked in and was treated like royalty! As for the food, it breaks my heart to say it wasnt the greatest, at least not up to Cali standards. Got some carne asada tacos and the majority of it was tough veins and fat. *sad face*. The employees were amazing and attentive so 5 stars on that! But as for the food it's a thumbs down in my book. *tear drop*"}
{"text":"Very terrible meat, the so call steak taste like rubber mixed with rocks. I definitely will not ever eat here or recommend this place to anyone. The Taco's that you can get from Del Taco, the same size are $4.00 dollars. Very expensive and not good meat at all. Don't waste your money or time, keep walking pass this place."}
{"text":"My friends were kind enough to walk down to grab some dinner for us while they got their gambling on. I had requested the kids rolled tacos chicken meal that came with chips, salsa and a drink. It was really all that I needed to get me through the night. The salas, light drizzle of sour cream and cilantro was perfect. I'd recommend the kids meals to those who want something small but not too small of a meal. 
Thanks Chronic Tacos for helping me not faint from hunger!"}
{"text":"I see a lot of places comparing chronic tacos to chipotle. Chronic tacos franchise have been around longer than chipotle. Maybe not here, but in California. 

That being said, we walked in and we're greeted immediately. The lady was busy and another employee came out of the back within a minute. We had not been to this restaurant before and they helped us with each step. The staff was extremely friendly and nice. It will be a place that we will revisit and I encourage everyone to visit, even if your first experience was less than perfect."}
{"text":"Ah, Chronic Tacos.  I discovered this place many moons ago when I lived in Southern California.  When I heard they'd be opening one here, I was definitely stoked.

Since then, that location in Summerlin has closed but Chronic Tacos lives again inside The Palms!  Great days.

The service is always on point, which is a breath of fresh air.  It sucks that it's now in the food court, making it a little awkward and rushed sometimes but the food quality is just as great.

For a long time I got their Chronic Carne Asada Fries, but since I have been making an active effort to eat healthier I switched to their chicken salad with dressing on the side.  Both are huge portions and very satisfying in their own right.  Everything else I've ordered here has never disappointed, either.

What's nice about the new location is you can ask for a sample - if you're not sure if you'll like a specific meat's seasoning, try it before you buy it!

Also, Baja sauce.  It's delicious."}
{"text":"First time I had this was when I lived in SoCal -- Pasadena location.  It was AWESOME.  I got a shrimp burrito and never looked back... Well OK that's a lie.  I looked back when I went back almost every month for this!  (It was almost an hour drive or it would have been WAY more often)

I AM SO HAPPY THERE IS ONE IN LAS VEGAS!  It totally channels that SoCal surfer dude feel and the employees seem to really dig their jobs -- which makes service awesome.  As much as I love their burritos, I have found something else that makes my heart cry for another:

Chronic Fries.

Oh my DSJHFSKD dude, get these with carne asada and slather on some baja sauce and go to heaven.  Bro, these fries are legit.

Bottom line: Awesome prices, good service, good seating, and epic food.  Join their Chronic Tacos Loyalty Program and receive random discounts n'stuff!"}
{"text":"It's sucks, order was messed up & refused to deliver the rest. Tacos were nasty. Would never recommend this place. Negative stars ----"}
{"text":"First time here! I'm so coming back. Way better than Chipotle, hands down. The atmosphere is perfect, deco is off the chain, and the food and service is rockin! Couldn't ask for better flavors and of course the personality of our server!"}
{"text":"Horrible food no flavor. I got the carnitas taco it has no flavor so bad had to throw it away. Service was poor. Fish taco was no good either greasy and no flavor. Green salsa is also gross no flavor..."}
{"text":"$17. Effing dollars for 4 tacos and a drink!!!! Never again!! The only reason they get one star is because at least the carne asada was good. The al pastor? Meh."}
{"text":"We gave Chronic Tacos another go tonight, because I really appreciated that the owner took the time to reply to my review almost immediately last time. And, the food is fantastic. Tonight's staff was phenomenal. All the ingredients were prepped and available and they even got me enrolled in the loyalty program. We had a really great meal & experience. Thanks Chronic Team!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna say this place is 5 star. Been here 3 times since they opened and it's definitely on my list to keep coming back. 

Love the baja style fish and shrimp tacos! Beer battered is delicious, takes a little longer, just a few minutes, but worth the wait. Steak and chicken tacos also on point. Everything is fresh and you have SO many options! 

Owner is on site and super nice hard working guy. You can see his staff respects and likes him. 

Reading some of the other reviews I think people are being too harsh, when a restaurant opens it takes a little time for the crew to be performing as a team. Instead of writing a bad review talk to the manager and let them correct their problem. Revisit the establishment and then write your review! 

I hate to see such a great place getting negative reviews when they just needed some time to learn and start functioning smoothly! 

Good job Chronic staff and owner!"}
{"text":"These are can't miss tacos. The meat is superb which is the base of any great tacos. You then add your own fixings. Always a go to.  Try the guac, its included with your taco purchase.  Nice employees and clean establishment. If you want spicy, truly spicy use their chronic sauce."}
{"text":"Really good and much better than Chipotle...it actually has flavor. Defiantly coming back."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been to Chronic Tacos. The first time we were blown away with how delicious our food was. This time we were incredibly underwhelmed. I got carne tacos. The steak had good seasoning but I spit out 5 big chunks of cartilage. I know that's somewhat typical to find in meat dishes but that's not the reasoning for the 3-star review. Chips were either stale or were too oily I couldn't tell the difference. I will say that the space is very clean and very entertaining to dine in. They have a full bar inside however it wasn't open on both occasions we were there. Very clean restaurant and helpful attendants. 3-star review because of the underwhelming food quality but 3 stars because it didn't entirely lose my interest for another visit."}
{"text":"Food handling by the employees appears to be acceptable now. The dude with the giant ass beard is now wearing a beard-net & I don't see employees eating on the line or keeping their drinks in view of customers anymore. 

The wait times suck! Usually there's only 2 people on the food line, including the cashier. There should be more food assembly line workers, especially during lunch rush hour."}
{"text":"I kind of had high hopes for Chronic Tacos. I heard about the original one in San Diego area from friend. He was telling me need to give it try. It been while since had tacos so figure Chronic Tacos it is.

The first impression is digging the vibe and the look of the restaurant. The artwork on the walls especially on one side with girl face painted like Day of the Dead. Pretty cool. The way the bar set up (really tiny bar and truth not bar bar but they do have HH specials, frozen margarita machines) different but in good way. They have lot of wide screens one above the bar area and few others spread out around the restaurant. The dining area more fast food looking cause you go up order and then pick spot eat if dining in. 

The food was nothing memorable. I ordered three tacos (one al pastor, two carne asada). You have option of want corn or flour tortillas. I went with the corn cause true street taco no such thing as flour. Both the al pastor and carne asada it was ok. I have had way better at other taco shops around Vegas. Not huge fan seeing all the proteins sitting in containers all cooked or the tortillas instead of traditional on flat top they use press get it warmed up. To be fair both al pastor and carne asada not dried out but also lacked any kind of flavor. Carne asada more use finer diced chopped meat but here get nice size cubes. Both proteins you do get nice size portion. I also ordered Chronic Fries. It sounded good. The gentlemen took my order said it is one of the more popular menu items. Chronic Fries is basically nachos except instead of chips you have fresh fries right out of the fryer. You basically load it with whatever you want for the most part. I went with chicken, black beans, cheese, mild salsa, and it killing me forget this orange looking sauce that kicked it up another level. Nacho cheese fries or chili cheese fries. They got NOTHING on Chronic Fries. Not only do the fries hold up cause thinking so much toppings they would get soggy quick. The combinations of flavors with every bite is addicting. I wish I knew cause would have passed on the tacos. 

The staff was awesome. The gentlemen took my order recommended the Chronic Fries and happy he did!!!! Friendly, nice, and attentive."}
{"text":"Not completely terrible but not good.  In case you are unfamiliar, it is basically a greasier, unhealthier version of Chipotle with a stoner/punk rock feel.  This location opened up across the street from a Chipotle (not smart) and feels way too polished and without character.  If you want Chronic Taco, stick with the Mill Ave location.  I'm not planning on returning here..."}
{"text":"Still on soft opening, but still...The iced tea dispenser (manual) was out of order.  I ordered a Chronic Salad with the lime cilantro vinaigrette.  I got a handful of lettuce and some kind of nasty chicken....then I was asked if I wanted something else on it...huh?  So, I eyed a bunch of dispensers and asked for cilantro and onions.  All this for 7 bucks and change.  Ugh.  They serve beer.  A customer was in there eating a burrito.  She said it was good.  I will give this place a wide berth for a while.  I will wander over to Potbelly or Chick Fil A for my salads.  Both are a few steps away.  Oh...the t-shirts were cool.  They will be available at some point."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times.  Each time, I've had difficulty ordering because it is just so confusing.  It's kind of like Chipotle but they have a ton more options and it's not quite clear what those options are.  I think you just have to lean against the glass and grunt, \"I want that.\"  Very stoner.

I've tried the chicken tostada bowl, chronic fries, a battered shrimp taco, and a carne asada taco.  The chicken tostada was ok but it came with a pathetic amount of sour cream and they left off the guacamole I ordered.  But I don't think they charged me for it, either.  The chronic fries, basically covered in everything including salsa, were pretty damn good though.  For whatever reason, these are advertised on their website, but are not on the menu.

The carne asada seems to be their claim to fame, but I didn't like it.  Too salty.  Then again, I got the very last bit of carne asada.  They were out by 6pm.  So maybe I didn't get the best representation of this dish, being the last little bit they had and all.  Also, he asked me if I wanted it baja style.  I said sure and that was a big mistake.  Mayo, cabbage.... doesn't really work with carne asada for me.  However, the shrimp taco baja style = excellent.

They have Dos Equis and Blue Moon on tap - $3 a pint.  The bar was completely empty.  I'm not sure if it is worth it for this place to have a liquor license.

I'm willing to try this place again and maybe get some booze.  But I need to have a heart to heart with the staff and get the low down on the menu."}
{"text":"The manager quickly welcomed me as a new guest - informed me of their different meats and options as he asked if I have ever been here - where in which I haven't. From start to finish - the experience and food was great. Definitely well maintained dining area with good music and tvs all around - will definitely be coming back to this location again. 

Again - great customer service and awesome food.
A+++++"}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos were amazeeee. So fresh and delicious. Woman behind the counter was as nice as could be."}
{"text":"Will never go back to chronic taco, they gave me a serious case of food poisoning. Threw up all night the worst case I've ever had. Dunno what they did but maybe they have contaminated meat. Had the shredded pork taco and threw every bit of it up. Was just fine before i ate there. Wanna warn others if you choose to eat there to be careful."}
{"text":"The place has gone to sh!t as the people working don't care about their customers and the food was not prepared well at all. My wife ordered a potato taco and it took forever and it came back burnt. We didn't say anything because we where in a hurry. My burrito bowl chicken was very small portion of protein and I had to ask for more. The service was slow and wasn't happy from the first few time we went when it opened."}
{"text":"Thanks Chronic Tacos... I can't stop farting my ass off. I came here because people from California raved about it.  Nothing special about this place. It's in the chipotle style and the ingredients did not look fresh nor did they taste it. And now internally they really did not seem fresh.  If you want a real taco or burrito, stick with the classics (Los Tacos, Tacos El Gordo ,etc.). If you want to be up all night with chronic gas, you know where to dine at."}
{"text":"Was a good quick lunch, but the carne asada meat was not warm,  Baja style shrimp and fish tacos were very good."}
{"text":"I have been here 5 times before I decided to do this review. What I love about this place is the consistency, the quality, the staff and the food. Across the board 5 stars. I am a born and raised Arizonian and I have Hispanic roots as well. This mixes perfectly in my taste buds! I do not eat meat so I do not know the quality of the meat. But the toppings are great, the veggies are wonderful, and the staff is super attentive, makes it easy to order. THE CHIPS. OH MY GOSH. They are so good and very authentic.

When you enter you can already feel the chill energy, I have been here all times of the day and every time its a good experience. I love the dim lighting, very traditional and retro. The music is wonderful to me. They have those dope soda machines where you can do crazy mixes. I have not dined in but the line is a pleasant experience, very fast paced. They are also very patient with new employees and made the experience fun for the customer. I love the chick with the septum ring and blue hair, she remembers me! I also like the girl who looks like she skates, has brown longish hair. Very sweet. Sometimes they get me on the upsell!

Something I want to touch on. The staff. I have never seen a more organized and friendly staff in my life. I LOVE the fact you can see the individuality of your staff and for once people are discriminated against for piercings or colored hair.

Any way I recommend this anytime of day, and everything is probably good. I saw the nachos tonight and I was emotionally moved by the food beauty."}
{"text":"We got a couple of Groupons for Chronic Tacos, so decided to give it a try.

The first time we went I got a pollo asado taco and a shrimp taco. They were okay. The chicken was pretty salty. I'm a big fan of salt, so if I thought it was salty, it must have been really salty. The shrimp taco was okay but not particularly memorable.

My wife got a carne asada burrito. It was okay. Nothing special.

The second time we went we got beef taquitos and a chicken quesadilla. I liked the taquitos and the quesadilla much better than the tacos and the burrito. However, I don't really have any desire to go back.

The decor is suited for teenage skater boys."}
{"text":"Very much like a Chipotle. I normally can't eat an entire burrito, so I end up ordering something smaller instead but they offered a \"small burrito\" which was still plenty of food for me. I didn't see a tofu option which I like on occasion and was disappointed that fajita veggies were extra. But if you go you should try the spicy mayo, it was surprisingly delicious on a burrito."}
{"text":"This another wannabe taco shop. Food was okay. The tacos were room temperature. Al pastor taco had a different taste and pork needed flavor. My husband got carne asada burrito, he said its okay. We might come back if we are hungry and we are close by."}
{"text":"It opened today and not dissapointed!  You get what you pay for, they don't skimp on the meat great selection of toppings. Set up like Chipotle but better menu and selection of meals. Carne asada great flavor, a little grissle. Friend had the carnitas, she really liked it. Stated they were more authentic then Chipotle. I'll be coming back to try rest of menu!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped in to give Chronic Tacos a try and I'm glad I did! 

The prices are super reasonable and you get a lot of bang for your buck. I grabbed lunch for Boyfriend and I on the way home from work. Two burritos, one carne asada and one carnitas. Both were the size of my dog. Both burritos were really good. I'd describe them as halfway between Chipotle and actual Mexican food. Chipotle format and style, but the meat would be perfectly at home in a Tijuana street taco. 

They have a ton of filling options, including al pastor and fish (!). Burritos ($5.99) and \"Fatty Tacos\" ($2.99) seem to be the main options. Plenty of toppings. They stuff those tortillas almost to bursting; no stinginess here! They also have a bar, which makes this place a great quick-but-not-fast-food dinner. After all, is there anything better in all the world than a cold beer and a giant burrito? I think not. 

Since I live in Henderson, I don't foresee us popping by for dinner, but I'll definitely be picking up to-go food in the future!"}
{"text":"I'm from LA where the tacos are real fresh, and often sold from food trucks windows. This establishment meets somewhere between food truck and chipotle. It's not exactly the cookie cutter burrito, but it's not exactly abuela's cooking either. 

You'll see an awesome gothic neon sign in the Palm Casino's Eatery, aka food court, that reads Chronic Tacos. There's a chipotlesque assembly line that offers tacos, burritos, and burrito bowls.  I tried the al pastor burrito ($7) with Spanish rice, black beans, cilantro, cheese, pico de gallo, salsa verde.  Sadly, I forgot to ask for sour cream. 

The al pastor roasting spike was nowhere in sight, and the spiced pork came from a collecting bin. The pork had little depth of flavor, but the bits of pineapple added bursts of sweet brightness. The rest of the burrito was pretty decent and filling. 

The cashier lady told me they didn't do water cups, and told me to go to Earl of Sandwich next door. But my friend got a water cup from Chronic Taco... hmmmmm. 

In conclusion, if you're in the mood for Mexican and you find yourself in Palm's, then Chronic Taco is not a bad choice.  Don't forget there's also Earl's though!  They got awesome sandwiches, and water cups!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing for a new place to have opened and have such nasty attitudes, before even getting in line... stood looked, walked right back out. Looked over priced and not good anyways though."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty delicious and fresh, and the price is about the same as any other Mexican spot. Although, the loss of 2 stars is due to their miserable employees. Lose the attitude and stop being grumpy. Their managers are fairly pleasant though. I might return and grab it to-go from now on."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Very much like chipotle: pick your base, protein, and sides. Came on a Sunday evening and my food was cold by the time i started eating. That's because one person was building all 4 of our meals one by one, so we waited a while to pay. There's a bar. Al Pastor tasted like chorizo, it was good."}
{"text":"I give the food a 5 star but a 2 for the employees. Tonight was my 3rd time ever, getting food from here. I'm still new to the menu and tonight, I felt very uncomfortable and unwanted. The only employee that was nice was the cook. The other 2 girls and guy weren't welcoming nor even had the care of great customer service. I kept getting the ugliest glares, eyerolls and attitude from both girls. There were only 2 people ahead of me, semi done with their orders and it took another 10minutes to get service. I even witnessed the 2 girl workers giving each other dirty looks when one wasn't looking. The guy was roaming around back and forth. I hardly witnessed any friendly communication between the employees and as well to customers. When I arrived I didn't get a \"Hello, Thanks for coming in, What would you like?\", It was just a \"What do you want?\". That is BAD BAD customer service. I am not a dramatic person or write reviews at all but when I am treated like shit, through my entire service here, of course.I'm going to tell. Horrible horrible. The manager or owner need to get better employees or take these people back to training. You're serving people food all day, what's so hard about being polite? My food portion size was very small as well. For a burrito, I got Carne Asada, she put about 4 scoops on, on a huge burrito bread! Then I asked how much is it to add more, she says $2.50 and add just 1 scoop. I felt like I didn't get my money's worth. Portion size and service wise. Chronic Tacos has great food but horrible service."}
{"text":"Tacos are great. 
However...service is chaotic at best. Nothing short of a 3-ring circus. If you only have time for a quick lunch, this isn't the place. The last time we went, the cashier asked us if we wanted drinks, we accepted...walked over to the fancy soda machine and we were greeted with a sign that said the carbonation wasn't working. Uh, thanks for the warning, cashier dude. On 3 occasions they were out of the carnitas meat. On one of those visits they said they had carnitas, but it was frozen, not kidding. We don't go there anymore because of the unpredictability. If there's more than 3 people in line, you're gonna be there a while."}
{"text":"Great nachos and fries, try them with carne asada."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome super fast so delicious I definitely recommend coming here! Great family atmosphere and had a very upscale Scottsdale kind of feel without the feeling everyone is trying too hard and giving you dirty looks lol. The flavors were incredibly fresh and bold. Absolutely impressed. New fav taco spot"}
{"text":"Amazing how my first review was a 5 and this is a 1. Can't be a zero because Yelp doesn't allow them. Chronic has always been my Sunday fall back when I can't think of any place else so I park by Sprout's to kill two birds with one stone. This afternoon I walked in two people were ahead of me to order and another customer was having his burrito air drying. I guess this is what the girl was doing. His burrito was flayed out on the counter like a spatchcock chicken. I don't know how long I was in there. Felt like forever but probably only a minute or so. She never moved. Never looked away from this guy unless she looked over his head to emphasize something she was telling him. All the while I was there she was talking. And since she wasn't adding anything to his burrito or touching it at all all I could think was she was letting it airdry. No acknowledgement that anyone was in line. And why only one person up front? So I left and will probably be the last time I have the ability to leave (meaning I won't be back) for sometime. Even at Taco Bell they acknowledge your standing there. I have noticed though the last few times I was in Chronic (I was there last Sunday) it has been sometime since a waiting customer has been acknowledged with a be right with you. Lately no one looks or says a word until it's time to order. The economy isn't doing all THAT well there are people out there that would really appreciate the opportunity to work."}
{"text":"3.75 Stars

I'm not driving out of my way to stop at Chronic Tacos, but when I'm in the area, I know I'll be full and satisfied eating here.

I like Chronic for the strong flavors and good portions.  Plenty of options for fillings.  Good prices.  This is not a traditional taqueria...it's Americanized...or Californianized (is that a word?), but the food is still solid. 

Slight divey feel is appealing to some as well."}
{"text":"The first time I went there it was great.  The second time I went was not so great.  I got the chicken tacos and they were SO greasy I could barely eat them.  I also ordered chips and salsa. The chips were so salty I couldn't even eat them, and they were dripping with grease.  I probably will not be returning"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? A few months ago, the menu had a bunch of cool items and specials, now it's no different than Chipotle . The hip, friendly people are gone, instead the servers and cashiers are there to assemble your food and send you on your way."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because I love tacos. When I first walked in I noticed the floors were messy. I went straight to the bathroom to wash my hands and the bathrooms were filthy. I ended up not ordering because if the bathrooms and common areas were that disgusting I'd hate to see how the food preparation stations were. The girls at the counter seemed annoyed that I was going to order. I was an inconvenience to her. Ended up going to smash burger."}
{"text":"Chronic Tacos is the best Fast-Casual Mexican Restaurant in town.  I went to Chronic Tacos throughout college in Southern California and now that it's here in Phoenix it's everything I remember it to be.  The owner, Brad, is a great guy who is in there doing whatever it takes to make it a great place to enjoy fantastic food.

The burritos seem to be 30% bigger than those other guy's burritos and they're 100% better tasting.  The variety you get is second to none and they even have cold beer on tap.

Awesome to have Chronic Tacos in Phoenix and this location knocks it out of the park."}
{"text":"My first time in and I loved it.  I ordered chicken tacos and chicken nachos for my husband.  Absolutely delicious!  We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place. Even after hearing blah reviews I went. Unfortunately everyone was right...the food is just ok. Nothing special. I will say the guacamole was tasty but everything else just had no flavor. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok...been waiting for awhile for this place to open up..came in tonight( a Friday ) wasn't too busy, but there was several people in line. Staff seemed rushed and hurried, ordered a carnitas taco and potato taco, boyfriend ordered fish and shrimp tacos.  By the time his was done my 2 were stone cold...he said his were really good. So food was  good, girl at cash register didn't know how to pour the beer, thankfully some one else came along and did it, and we had to ask 2 times for our chips and salsa, which the salsa was not really salsa...so the staff..is so so...I hope it was just opening jitters and I will come back in a few months to try again..hopefully this place will work out the little kinks they had tonight."}
{"text":"I will always recommend the chicken. The chicken is Amazing, I'm not a huge fan of the steak, but I'm not a fan of steak in general. But my bf loves the steak tho. I work in the plaza so it's a go to place for me, I have been disappointed once before but they were happy to fix my problems, the owner is a great guy, the staff is very friendly and accommodating to my picky needs. lol It's by far my favorite \"Mexicali\" place to go."}
{"text":"OK this is the first time I've visited this place and it is the bomb!! Now I know where to come when I wanna have great tacos cold beer and Rob and his staff are the best! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out tonight.  Extremely disappointed.  I tried a Carne asada taco, a chicken taco, and a pork taco. Carne asada and chicken were ok but a little salty, the pork was terrible. I had the same experience as another reviewer with my food being cold by the time I finally got it and sat down. I also agree that it is way over priced.  The decor is fun and right up my alley but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Meh... this place is most comprable to a combination of Pinches Tacos & chipotle. I personally dislike Chipotle. Pinches Tacos is a million times better. I tried out this new place, but it's highly unlikely I'll return."}
{"text":"I'm usually not one to rant but this is the most unorganized restaurant I've ever been to. They're never ready for customers, they take way too long to make what should be \"fast food\". They are so unprepared and have been out of guacamole and veggies on two separate occasions. They told me to order online for \"quicker service\" and BOTH times I've ordered online they haven't even started my order once I get there (at the time stated it'd be ready), so I'm there for 10+ minutes waiting for them to get it together. One time the lady couldn't even find where she put my online order. I've given them 3 chances and each time they've taken way too long, are unprepared, and have no idea what they're doing. By far some of the worst customer service I've experienced."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences of our lives. We went in as a group of 6 people, and we wanted to order our tacos how you're supposed to up front but they told us we couldn't do that that we had to sit and order from the table. Imagine making a chipotle burrito sitting at the table, like you have no idea what you want in it you want to look at all the stuff they have out and see. Besides that here were 3 people helping us and none of them were cross trained to do anything else besides the one task at hand including their bartender. The owner was there the entire time and witnessed them giving me chicken on the bottom of my vegetarian bowl, and their excuse was \"oh well I didn't make it\" well who the hell made it? Then bones were found in the chicken taco, and they gave half the order and forgot about the other half serving other people in the restaurant before finishing my table so some of us ate and others watched. I forgot all that else happened but this is the definition of a zero star restaurant"}
{"text":"The best carnitas tacos I have EVER had!!! I wish I could give it more stars ^_^ friendly staff and really good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! Very friendly staff as well. It's super close to shopping so it's very convenient to stop at. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just tried Chronic Tacos for the first time. I ordered the Tacos because I figured that is what they would be known for but I was a little disappointed. The carne asada taco was good but the battered fish taco was horrible. I thought it would be lightly battered but it was over cooked. Half of the fish taco was just the fried batter and no fish. My fiancé got a burrito and really did not like that either. I think maybe since it was our first time we did not know what to order. The workers were pretty friendly, they seem to really enjoy the Chronic... I would definitely give it another shot even though we did not have the best experience the first time. I would like to try a bowl or salad next time."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for such sub par food. No seasoning, no proper cooking technique used for the meats, etc. it pretty much tasted like everything was pulled out of a freezer, thrown into a microwave, then tossed into a steam table. I had really high hopes for this place. Do yourself a favor. Walk to the door, stop, look right, and head towards the chipotle you see."}
{"text":"This place has been open for quite a while now. In fact I wrote a 4 star review soon after it opened. I was fairly impressed then. Now, not so much.
Back then they struggled with speed of service. New business - cut them slack. Right?
They are STILL struggling! Tonight there were 5 people in front of me waiting to begin their orders and 3 already in process. I didn't get to the register for 24 minutes!
They simply don't have the process down like they do at Chipotle and Cafe Rio, both very close by. This has been an issue the last few times I've been here. I was told 3 times by the lead-off server, \"I'll be right with you\" as she ran around chasing orders and supplies. Meanwhile the other 2 assembly staff sat and watched her. They need at least one more person on the assembly line and they all need to work as a team.
It's really too bad. The food is decent. Good flavor. Good portions for the price.
If you drive up and there's NO line, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Love the fatty tacos - I got Pollo Asado and medium hot sauce!  The sauce makes these, as it is more a sauce than an salsa.  The pollo Asado quesadilla was very good!  The price is great - and the service very friendly!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and I can say it's a good place to grab a byte.  I work near by and it's quick convenient and the food is solid.  Is it the best? No but good quality and value.  The hot salsa is pretty hot.   They also have beer now."}
{"text":"Shocked it's only 3 stars. This is the best burrito place I've tried in the area. Food quality and cleanliness alone are better than the top two competitors based on star rating. The staff has always helpful and friendly. Everything is always clean. The food has never been unsatisfactory. I consistently get a potato taco and chicken burrito. Highly recommend both of those.

The worst thing that has happened on a visit is they were out of guacamole. That was once in maybe 10 visits. I don't expect it's a regular thing."}
{"text":"Im not sure about this place. First time vist. Its expnsive for Mexican food.
I had a El pastor. It was good. It was 3.99 + tax. It wasnt spicy as described. I added green salsa to it and that got it there. 
Had a Fish taco baja style. It cost 3.99 + .50+ tax $4.86
Nothing special the baja sauce is spicy which I like but it sure didnt feel like I got 4 bucks on that taco.
I askedthe person doing the service about what makes their tacos worth the price. She said it was all natural ingredents. So I had to ask \" are these sustainable protiens and organic toppings\"  She did not have an honest answer so she asked the cook. He didnt now what \"sustainable \" meant. Im not trying to be a biotch but I want to know why the cost is so high here. 
Probably wont be back. Foods ok, but I can get a pretty good fish taco at Del taco for 2 bucks, as a matter of fact I could get 4 for what I spent on two very ordinary tacos. And at least I go in knowing its not organic or sustainable.  Lol  They got 2 out of 3 stars due to the young lady who was honest and courteous. 
Btw everyting is sold without rice and beans. That add on is going to set yu back an additional 3.99. Whew
Bring a wad of cash with you."}
{"text":"The first time my husband and I came here a few months ago, it was amazing! We were enthusiastically greeted by the staff, everything was super clean and fresh, and the food was really good. We've come back consistently since then and have noticed it's slowly gotten worse and worse (we go at least once a week). The staff is still very friendly, but the food line is so gross. The counter they build your burrito on is never wiped down, and the condiments/toppings are always mixed (cheese dropped in the salsa bins, onions in the limes, etc.). It's very unappetizing to watch your food be prepared is these conditions and a clear sign that there is lack of management. Please fix this so we can continue to support your business!"}
{"text":"I am not so sure why this doesn't have more stars. I love there tacos. I usually go to one in Redondo Beach.
Every time I ready here it is really good!"}
{"text":"When looking at the early years of Chronic Tacos to how it's changed now, you can feel a sense of redesign, re-thought, and improved menu all the way from their spicy Al Pastor to their juicy tender  Asada picking up some chips and salsa is the best way to end your grub night with your friends and family. Look out there environment, is phenomenal they have one of the coolest garage doors that leads you to the patio; it's a great space to bring family and friends - grab a beer, grab a soda and just enjoy some tacos and nice family setting!  And if you're ever there when Teresa works watch out she gives you the best customer service there is!"}
{"text":"Really good.  Better than Chipotle.  I'm not a huge fan of chain taco/burrito places, but the portions are right for the price, the atmosphere is fun, and the food is pretty good.  El pastor wasn't amazing, but it was good and the large size burrito is more than filling."}
{"text":"Well...i have given this place many chances and the customer service just seems to be getting worse, not better. On the last three visits there have been a problem with each visit. Two weeks ago I was over charged for a large combo. I was charged 2.59 for chips salsa and drink plus an extra $2 for the large drink. I didn't realize it until after she ran my card. The cashier looked dumbfounded and confused as to my concern. Eventually, the manager came and refunded the difference. He didn't seem overly concerned his cashiers were over charging customers. 
The next visit I arrive well after lunch rush and before the after dinner, they were out of the pico de gallo. The manager was in the back cleaning and looked unconcerned. The manager(same guy as before) came out and said it would be 2-3 minutes. I choose to wait(I had a feeling i should have said forget it at that point). 10 minutes later he comes out with the pico to put on my cold burrito. No apology for the wait. Pay for my food and go to the drink dispenser and its almost all of the low calorie options were empty. Mentioned it to the cashier and the manager came and gave excuses as to why it was empty. I couldn't deal with it at this point and i asked for my money back. Went to Potbelly two doors down. Came back again today hoping, begging that they could get it together because their food is good.  Made it through the order process and when i asked for an extra cup of salsa with my chips and salsa he (same manager) said there would be an extra charge for the extra cup of salsa. He said this was a new policy. At this point, I just sat down and ate my burrito and half my chips because i ran out of salsa. I tried to give this place a shot because its locally owned by a guy named Brad I believe. I am for the local guy over the corporate giants but i doubt i will be back. Go to Chipotle or Potbelly instead."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. I really like how their food line is set up like Chipotles, for you to set up your food as you go. Yet there's a different vibe when you walk in here. The customer service was great, at least with the employee I was with. I had the burrito bowl, and they give you a lot for the price. I love how I was able to sample the meats before picking. I highly recommend coming just to try it out."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time tonight with my bf and I thought the food was delicious as well as the service. I work at a restaurant with a similar concept so I'm very observant and curious how other places run and I had to say we had a great first experience. The blonde girl at the counter was very helpful considering it was our first time and I really appreciate that! We had the breakfast burrito and that alone will definitely bring us back again."}
{"text":"Just say no....my first time here and just got the chicken bowl-rito. It was horrible and could not even eat it. Hubby got fish tacos and he says no way. Waste of $26.00. Sorry but never again."}
{"text":"We've given this place a solid try. The few times we've gone the food was good but the service is really bad! Mgmt needs to hire and get the staff some help! 3 people working (2 up front and 1 cook) a lunch rush is totally unacceptable and they were out of everything! Not fair to the 3 people working and for the line of people that had to wait way too long. Get it together CT!"}
{"text":"The people here have business down!! Customer service 10+.... the young man gave us a discount do to the horchata not being cold. He was in the middle of training someone, I believe he was the assistant manager... Food was 10+ I couldn't eat all mine  but it was amazing. We tell others we see to go here all the time. :)"}
{"text":"Decor has a cute Dia de los Muertos v+ modern urban feel. Seating is comfortable.  Pretty good draft and bottled beer options.  

I tried an Al Pastor and a Carnitas taco. Both were too greasy but were seasoned ok. But they were a big disappointment because both the corn tortillas and meat filling were cold. I hope I don't get food poisoning from the under temp meat. It might have been hot when they scooped it onto my plate, but had gone cold by the time I paid and sat down. This is even though there was only one person ahead of me in line. 

They had 2 assembly line workers during lunch rush - just not effective to move the line fast enough. It only got worse after I made it through the line. And staff were initially friendly but showed their stress as they got more and more overwhelmed. Tables weren't being wiped down either, so you had to clean a place to sit down. If you come in and see only 2 people working, walk out and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Place was okay. Excited to try it. 5 employees working & it wasn't busy yet nobody seemed to know what they were doing. I got a steak salad and it is just okay. A lot like chipotle. I was charged $1.99 for a little guacamole on my salad. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is great! Staff is friendly, clean environment, and reasonably priced. I'll definitely be stopping by again!"}
{"text":"Make your own. Like Chipotle place. It's good especially if you are picky. Nice workers."}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday after the Color Run. There was no line and now I know why. The food was awful, the portions were small, and the employees were talking about the customers in Spanish (I know because I'm fluent)! I'd give this place negative stars if I could. Needless to say, I will NOT be back."}
{"text":"The chorizo breakfast burrito was probably the worst thing I've ever tasted in my life. 

Never again."}
{"text":"Great spot if you want great bang for your buck. Not only that the food is delicious. The al pastor is perfect. The fish taco is to die for! We need more spots like this it town rather then the hustle and bustle of the strip."}
{"text":"Just happened to see this place and thought we'd check it out.  Love'd the variety of food we could order, the only thing i would have to complain about would be my corn tortillas not being fully warmed up so they broke apart. And even with that I loved the tacos. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I got some late night snacks here . I was impressed by the flavor of the carne Asada , the  other thing I liked is you can add toppings like guacamole for free . They had some solid options and I will be back next trip, if the customer service was better I might have given them 5 stars ."}
{"text":"On my first visit to Chronic Tacos, I tried their chicken tacos. The meat was pretty salty and I was pretty underwhelmed by the meal. I had some coworkers rave about this place so I decided to give it another shot. Second visit, tried the carne asada tacos. Salty and dry. I think my coworkers were smoking some chronic when they ate here. That's the only explanation I can think of."}
{"text":"Overpriced. The nacho I ordered was not done right, cheese either too hard or not melted."}
{"text":"Brad and his wife are so kind! They go out of their way to engage with customers and ensure each visitor's experience is a great one! On top of that, the food is awesome. I highly recommend the baja fish tacos (beer battered!) or a chicken burrito. You can't go wrong! 

If you are looking to support good business owners and food, look no further."}
{"text":"yea service 5 stars and food 4 and a half. i always past this place and thought ey. so we tried. the service was incredible. young people really nice. the food fantastic for what it is. so is this gourmet food. no! its really good street food. my partner had beer batter tacos. omg hes ordering more now. i had a burrito with carne asada. the carne asada had flavor. so not boiled meet like rabertos. well be back! attention owner of this business. i watched 6 customers walk away from slow service. money not in your pocket. my partner been waiting 20 minutes! there was no line when we first walked up. food is great better do something about this."}
{"text":"Yay!  Chronic Taco opened in my neighborhood!  Love this place, the food is great, and the people who work here seem like they love it.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Oh yum!  I had a carnitas taco and it was sublime!  I came on Taco Tuesday, so it was a little nuts, but they were reasonably fast, very polite, and the place is clean.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Great experience... Prepare to wait a minute or two extra while they take their time to make sure you get what you want. Ask how they get their meals and you can't go wrong. Go for \"Hawaiian style\" shrimp tacos and you're good to go. 5/5 would recommend. Very awesome staff and great meals"}
{"text":"Stepped in to take a gander. There was one employee there struggling to put together one order before me. Read a few reviews before I walked out. There was only one other customer there during the later hours of lunchtime(1:30ish) I decided to walk out in fear of what I would most likely regret.  Can't really give it a rating since I didn't try the food but a blessing I didn't really order."}
{"text":"I see lots of complaints about the service and food. NEVER had it happen to us. We drive from Tempe to eat there. Yes there is Chipotle but CT is different and has not been killed by McDonalds owning it. If you want burrito the size of your forearm or some great tacos at a great price this is it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in because I had heard a lot about this place and as usual, people are wrong. The food is horrible. I didnt finish anything but my ice tea. Bland, cold and all around gross.

Al pastor and carne asada tacos on corn tortillas. The hot salsa. Cabbage.

Both the pork and the beef low quality. Every bite was full of gristle and to make matters worse it was cold.

Veggies were good. Chips were good.

I swear the cabbage was the most flavorfull thing on each taco.

The staff was great. Good kids working here who obviously want to do a good job.

Wada Street Tacos dont just have these guys beat, they are thrashing them in every way possible so do yourself a favor and go there."}
{"text":"Chronic tacos is my favorite place to have lunch at work. It helps that it's Mexican food which is my all time favorite food. My favorite thing to get it the handheld burrito. It's not as big as there normal burrito but it's perfect for lunch. When you order after 2pm you het free chip and salsa which are amazing as well. I really like their steak, seasoned pretty well. Not a huge fan of the chicken, but I like to change it up once in a while. 

Another thing I like is they have the limes on the line for tacos and burritos. Also the staff is really nice. They put on extra cheese or salsa for me if I ask. Plus they always chat me up when they can. Cool place to go."}
{"text":"Best meal you can get at Palms. Food is absolutely delicious. So much flavor to the steak and chicken. Spanish rice is on point. The price is very reasonable for an in-resort restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"I just thought the price was not worth the quality of food they provide. Also, disappointed at the slow service and servers were not friendly. I've been here twice and got the same treatment. Maybe some customer service training to help the business?"}
{"text":"Second visit to this place. Much better service and food this time around. Had the chicken tacos and got full. The place was not busy so we got our food pretty fast. Recommended for your taco cravings."}
{"text":"Although the food is for the most part great, the service is very slow!

I went in with my family and there were two people ahead of us. Two workers were cooking behind the counter and seemed to be messing around more than anything. One worker was at the cash register, the other was making customer orders. Two people ahead of us, no one sitting in the dining area, we were there for 30 minutes before we got to start telling our order. This isn't the first time either.

The food is good. However, I've been there a few times and the rice is not cooked all the way and was very crunchy. A native of California, I was happy to see this place out in Arizona. However, I'm considering sticking to Chipotle if they don't improve."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! The meat was so tender and flavorful. The options for toppings were plentiful and fresh. The tacos come with guacamole, which equals instant fan for me. The atmosphere was great and fun. Everything felt fresh and clean from walking in to using the restroom. Chronic Tacos is definitely on my radar now and I'll be on the look out for one in my area."}
{"text":"If your looking for a decent taco place that is over priced Chronic tacos is the spot! The food is nothing special, but still good. My biggest complaint was the temperature... it had to be around 65 degrees in there!! by the time our tacos were made and to the table they were cold. 

TURN THE TEMPERATURE UP AND YOUR PRICES DOWN!!"}
{"text":"Talk about quality! Not only are the employees friendly and the location ideal for a delicious lunch or dinner, but the quality of the food is fantastic! Every item is fresh, full of flavor, and the portions are perfect. I've had the carne asada, al pastor, and chicken tacos. The meat is so delicious that it doesn't NEED salsa, but you CAN'T skip the salsa (and chips)! The icing on the cake is the high tech Coca Cola machine; you can literally have any flavor of soda you could possibly imagine. You will not be disappointed in this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Don't expect your usual taco's as this is very different.  The food is ok, the staff is really nice."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice and ordered the carne asada burrito both times. The food was awesome and I add sour cream and guacamole and received generous amounts. The only negative thing I would say is that it seems as if they're understaffed. I just wish they were a bit faster while getting the orders together. Both times I went was on my lunch break and by the time I'd get back to work, I barely had time left to eat :/"}
{"text":"Close to work, and ordered for take out, was not impressed, the proteins tasted old,  and dry.  Like they had been sitting out in the hot water tins for a while.  One employee was out on the serving line,  which she was polite n helpful.  I am not sure if I would go back again for take out.  Perhaps as a dine in maybe but yet tge drive is far from my home and have more delicious places on P83 Street.  It seems that they are trying or mirroring Chipotle."}
{"text":"I had the steak tacos when I went in there. They were great! I like the mix of great food and beverages. The staff was friendly and I had a great overall experience. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"OMG I have a new addiction!
I have had this craving for grilled fish and shrimp tacos as of late. By 4p I was overdue for lunch (now dinner?) and I decided to give Chronic Tacos a try. 

After checking out their menu I decided to go with a grilled fish salad. Bottom line- it was delicious! The fish was fresh, firm, and seasoned well. The salad was assembled after the fish was grilled. The lettuce and cabbage were cold, fresh and crisp. There were many choices of additional toppings and all of my selections were good. 

I was greeted when I walked in and the employees were friendly and professional, helpful in explaining the menu and fast with my order.

I thought the value price-wise was excellent. I don't know where I could get a $10 grilled fish salad of this size, with ingredients of this caliber for less. 
I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Why did I even come here? If had to pick Chronic Tacos or Taco Bell, no doubt I would pick Taco Bell. It's that bad. I got an Carne Asada Burrito and it tasted straight from the microwave. This place is horrible, it's not authentic. My first and last time coming here!"}
{"text":"Great service and AlPastor has best spice and flavor.  Busy for lunch but they get you out."}
{"text":"Kinda overpriced tacos, limited options, and the taste was pretty generic, the bar being inside the restaurant is a nice touch, but thats about it."}
{"text":"Gosh it was amazing this place is so wonderful I love everything about it  also the customer service was amazing the young ladys were very energetic outgoing and polite the cashier Brenda she's a sweetie she made sure I was satisfied with my meal and made sure i left with a smile on my face was haveing a bad day until   i met miss brenda I wanna give them a five star and again thank you Brenda(:"}
{"text":"First time here and my last. Ok I'm vegan with a cheat day here and there. I wasted a cheat day on this!! I got a carne asada burrito with frys added. The whole burrito was seriously 80% rice 10% beans 5% salsa and the rest asada. Do the math there was no asada. It was very unseasoned. At least salt it as you cook it. I need better stops for a meat cheat day...."}
{"text":"This place is next door to Jersey Mike's, which I hit up for lunch about once a week.  Decided to stop in and I am glad I did. Very friendly employees and some delicious food! Haven't tried a lot on the menu yet, but everything I have had was delicious!"}
{"text":"It was my first time on Election Day for quick lunch to take home with me! The place has a darling interior, looks clean and the ingredients were piping hot & fresh!! I purchased a small burrito- Thank goodness!! I ate half and was completely satisfied. I put the other half in the fridge for a snack later!! I thought this is so similar to Chipotle style how different can it taste....I was surprised that the flavor surpassed the normal!! The service was quick and friendly even though it was just starting to get busy for the lunch rush! I will be back!!"}

{"text":"I do not like Chronic Tacos but after the club at the Palms we decided to grab a bite to eat.  this place seemed like a good idea being drunk and all.  my boyfriend got a fat carne asada burrito. Not sure if it was because we were drunk, but this burrito was pretty bomb.  it was so delicious omg I wanted one to myself.  I would come here to eat this again.  food was good. service on the other hand not so much. the girls just didnt seem like they wanted to be there. other than that it was good."}
{"text":"So this place is real new and i had to try this place when I saw the line out the door (was going to sultans grill next door).  From the door I thought I was going to be in heaven considering it was so packed and the menu was awesome with burritos, tacos, and tortas and they had pastor and carnitas, in the end I was let down.  I got a steak burrito and a pastor taco.

First the burrito was priced ok at 6 bones and it was a buck more for guac, not bad.  The carne asada was not good, like really finely chopped up meat stewing in taco sauce that tasted like something made from a package of taco seasoning mix, and it didn't have a good steak texture.  To be honest it really reminded me of crappy taco meat.  The rice tasted bland and the refried beans tasted canned to me.  It wasn't too big either, chipotle or cafe rio is way bigger for the price.  Also the tortillas weren't really good, not going to put it into words why I didn't like them but rio has some awesome tortillas and this place didn't.  It absolutely tasted like some one made mexican night at there house with taco meat, rice a roni spanish rice, canned beans, and mission tortillas. 

The pastor in the taco had good flavor for sure but it wasn't that meaty and was mushy in texture, one taco was 3 bucks and it was a little skimpy too, nothing memorable and except for the pork it had that same \"generic\" flavor as the burrito.

Now the service was extremely friendly and what looked like the owner came by and asked how everything was and was real nice too.  I did have to wait a while but I saw the line so no negative thing about that.  I have waited a long time for slider truck and it's delicious so no big deal, what do you expect when a place is slammed. 

My advice for anyone who cares or is listening, better seasoning of the rice and beans (home made if it isn't), and grill up some real carne asada.  The portions aren't as big as rio or chipotle, the quality isn't as good as rio or chipotle, and it isn't cheaper than rio or chipotle, something isn't adding up.  Oh well the place is packed (for now at least) so what do I know."}
{"text":"Despite the food being pretty decent, the setup and service is incredibly lackluster. If you order something that needs to be called back to the kitchen for, you risk getting completely lost in the line while you wait. Our fajita veggies were forgotten about for the nachos which caused the other food to get cold, especially because when they ran out of sour cream instead of keeping our place, they served four people ahead of us while it was retrieved from the back. No big deal except their food all ended up getting made completely before ours, leaving 3/4 of the food we ordered on the table to get cold. Foods good, process sucks."}
{"text":"While the atmosphere is contemporary and inviting the food leaves a lot to be desired. We had two people in our party. I ordered a carne asada and an el pastor taco. Although they advertised with guacamole they failed to put it on my tacos. Then they charged us $1.99 add on fee for guacamole on a  salad. First, the carne asada which they also charge extra, was tough. I couldn't eat the el pastor and had to throw it out. As for the salad, the lettuce was slightly brown, looked like it had been chopped a long time before we arrived. The guacamole was discolored and didn't taste very fresh."}
{"text":"Hit the spot


Chronic Tacos offers a very good selection of burritos, tacos, and other popular dishes and all are reasonably priced and they taste great. This is the \"subway\" of tacos and burritos. Basically, you choose your base (taco, quesadilla, burrito, etc) and then add your meat, cheese, & veggies as you go down the assembly line. 

Chronic Tacos is not a fast food joint, so you get freshly made burritos that are a really good size and they are made with fresh tortillas that are absolutely delicious. The meat is tender and so flavorful and the chips are crispy, hot  and lightly salted the perfect chip

The staff was great and it didn't take any time to get our food. The food was good.  If your in the area you have to try this place you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. Decided to try it out instead of my usual Chipotle. It is AMAZING!! I ordered the carne torta. As my bread was toasting, I realized they also serve Al Pastor, I had to order a taco!  It was all very flavorful! The service was great as the girls working the counter were happy and helpful for someone who had not been here before. I like that they offer refried beans as an option and the lime juice is great as well. 

The only thing I would like to see change is that they keep the prep area a bit cleaner and if the toppings mix that they try to clean that a bit. There were onions mixed in the cheese and guacamole dripped in the salsa. I noticed because I don't like either of them but wanted what they were in. 

I will definitely bring my family in to try it!"}
{"text":"I decided to do 3 stars because I do like their food. But had a really disappointing experience today and it put a really bad taste in my mouth and probably won't got back because of it. My boyfriend and I have been there several times before, my boyfriend always requests rice and beans on his tacos; he's never had an issue. Today I decided I wanted to try the tacos with the rice and beans; the girl looked at me like I offended her and told me they weren't allowed to put rice and beans on the tacos. I was surprised since my boyfriend has done it so many times before, but I told her if she's not allowed to do it then don't. She said she'd do it this time but the management is cracking down and they won't be able to do it again. While we where checking out, she told the general manager that we asked for rice and beans on our tacos. He then proceeded to say \"oh yeah, I recognize you guys and I've told you before that we don't do rice and beans on our tacos, I'm the GM and I'm cracking down on that.\" I've never seen that guy before and we did nothing to warrant a public reprimand. We didn't make a scene and told the girl if she couldn't do it then don't. I was so shocked at the very loud, very rude reprimand over politely asking for beans and rice. I just shook my head and said nobody had said anything before. 
It's a shame, my boyfriend prefers the tacos here over chipotle but if they charge nearly $4 for a taco and putting rice and beans on it is such a huge issue that it warrants making a scene when we weren't making a scene or even that mad about it, we might have to switch back to chipotle."}
{"text":"Saw this place pop up on Facebook. It's like Chipotle, where you can pick what you want in your burrito or taco. They had more selection in there fillings but, shared one major flaw in common. The Carne asada is what I had and it was very chewy and grisly. Not a fan of the meat. The hot sauce had no flavor and was not hot at all. I did like the different cheese and rice options. I would recommend trying the fish or shrimp. It's is a little over priced for what you get. The staff was friendly and polite. I might give this a 2nd chance but only to try the fish or shrimp."}
{"text":"I got to say chronic taco is finally getting better at Uber eats ordering. A couple of months back I would order through the app and get the wrong order. I would call management to inform them of the wrong order and they suggested that I go to the location and place the order myself so It wasn't wrong. So I took a break from chronic taco for little bit and decided to try to give them another chance. Better communication with staff. (Very friendly towards customers) also have made several orders to Uber eats with no missed or wrong orders. I definitely suggest this location for your chronic taco needs."}
{"text":"The food is great and fresh! It's awesome that they have so many choices. It's way better than your average chipotle. The customer service is great and staff is always smiling and helpful. This is definitely one of my new favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Chronic Taco is a line order taco shop with some unique flair on the menu. The #1 thing talked about is their version of loaded French fries. Called Chronic fries, they come like a taco or nacho plate that places it's fillings on the fries. 

I tries the Chronic fries and a taco. The pork meat was juicy but not surprising. The carne asada meat was less inspiring still, not flavorful or juicy. The combination of ingredients on the fries is a nice twist, but ultimately my local Mexican burrito shop offers something like it, and it's much tastier.

I know this place has gotten much chat lately, but after this first visit I left unimpressed.

Worse was that the prices are far too high . The portions were definitely generous, but without the flavor, and with the high prices, I won't be looking for a reason to return soon."}
{"text":"Well, this was definitely a BAD and regrettable choice to have meal from Chronic Tacos. My classmates and I agreed to try out a new place that was in the remote are and when we took a glance, we thought-hey why not give this place a shot. However, we were greatly disappointed. We ended up beating the lunch crowd by mere minutes and when we took a look at the menu, we thought-this sounds interesting. Little did we know that this place is unable to execute when it comes to service and serving. We waited and waited and waited while the few employes had problems with moving back and forth without organization in keeping a cohesive momentum. Which led to a bit of chaos with guests ending up being staggered and wondering, okay do I stand here while this person serving me just headed over there for whatever reason and then is helping someone else without completing the order? The steak was inedible due to it was Extremely TOUGH, ROUGH and very difficult to chew. The black beans were even worse than the steak with it being HARD and not cooked thoroughly, this was throughout my burrito. I can't understand how what seems to be soooo simple could be soooo WRONG. There were four of us and we didn't realize our orders were inedible until after attempting to consume our lunch since we took it to go. I literally only took a bite and could not believe I spent approximately $8 that ended up thrown into the rubbish. The food absolutely should be tested out by the ownership/management prior to offering it to the public. Unfortunately, there will be a ZERO return factor and a ZERO referral. Classmates that opted for chicken indicated it was very salty."}
{"text":"I'd been here before and it was good, but I have since changed my eating habits and I'm really watching what I eat. I was happy to see a lot of healthy options and I had a bowl of yummy beans, rice and greens with salsa, it was very delicious! The staff is friendly and it was clean!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service.  My husband and I were greeted as soon as we walked through the door.  We were asked if we had ever been which we replied \"no\".  We got a very  ice explanation of the menu and how it works.  My husband got the carnitas burrito and I opted for the carnitas bowl.  The toppings were awesome.  All of the food was fresh and delicious.   The beer on tap perfectly compliments the food.  We will be coming back for more, it was quite simply delicious."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre.  The decor is dark and has a  \"closed in\" feeling with walls around the booths.   I had a carne asada burrito which was huge, but the steak tasted like it was burnt.  This place is overpriced for the lack of quality in their food."}
{"text":"Love this place did come on taco tuesday! 1.99 a taco I got 4 small kinda like street tacos with great ingredients! but there is no way I would pay 3.49 a taco, that is way to steep!! ill stick with the burritos!"}
{"text":"This place is like an overrated higher priced chipotle. They charge extra for everything. All the items were covered so you couldn't even see the choices. The quality didn't seem very good and the service was terrible. I'm amazed that this place has 4 stars. My wife ordered a burrito bowl and all she had on it was beans, meat, lettuce, pico, cheese and it was like $9 cause they charge extra for everything. So stupid. It's like going to a sit down Mexican restaurant that charges for chips and salsa. Lame."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is by far the worst. I asked for a cup of water and they said they don't have one..wow, don't be in a business if you are that cheap to not provide customers for water. I wish I can give them zero star if yelp allows it..."}
{"text":"The location is close to work. The food is good. The atmosphere is fun. I like the full bar and the paintings on the wall. I usually get the tacos or the chronic fries. Food taste fresh and the service is friendly. Get your chronic taco on!"}
{"text":"The food is great here particularly the pork carnita tacos. The taste is oh so good. I had noticed they were real skimpy on the meat our last visit. The man in front of me obviously it was his 1st time there. Wasn't too sure what was what and staff was not very helpful or friendly. The girl helping us was in training she also didn't know much about the menu. His burrito was unbelievable small almost all rice. They had to throw stuff away because they didn't quit explain the pico was the only form of tomatoes they had. The cashier should have probably been helping out the line which was backed up. Ran out of green sauce it was 2:30 in the afternoon on a Friday... Were they making more? I say work on your customer service more, clean up the tables so people can sit and eat. I've been there 3 times 3 Fridays in a row same kid is on break every time while tables are not wiped down for customers. Like I said I love the food I just hope the service gets better."}
{"text":"Where to begin... we walked in and it was dead but the counter and all around the food containers were super dirty. Even the trays they were putting the new food on were dirty. The ordering process was terrible, half way through us ordering they would interrupt us to yell at the chef in the back. It took forever and the food was not great.  No flavor at all. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Chronic Tacos? 

YES!

The second I walked into this place I was blown away.  Tucked away in the middle of Summerlin is a place called \"Chronic Tacos\" that breathes new life into this other wise sterile shopping center.

First impression of the place that hasn't been open a week... what is all this writing on the wall? Did all this writing happen in less than a week?

They supply the sharpies and you are welcomed to write on the walls and tables.

They have an employee come up to you when you first hit the line and they get you a drink while you wait on what seems to be the honor system.

They carry coke products and I opted for the safe choice of Minute Maid Lemonade.

I came at 8:30pm at night and this place was still busy!  The music was blaring, the line was friendly, the staff was friendly, the entire place was like entering your cool friends house in high school.  

When my turn came up, I opted for the Carne Asada Burrito which I had made with: spanish rice, black beans, \"baja style\" sauce, pico de gallo salsa, cheese, cilantro and onions.  My meal with the burrito and the drink came out to under $9.

Let me tell you, all the staff are super friendly and I have never seen a group of people that appear to absolutely love their jobs!  A very refreshing experience.

After we sat down to eat, we were greeted by 5 different people that offered to refill your drinks or take away your trash.

I am definitely coming back to this place very soon!

The food was great!  The atmosphere was great!

I asked one of the employees and they say they are open from 9am to 9pm.

One more thing - Scream \"I Love Chronic Tacos!\" and just see what happens..."}
{"text":"After it had been in our neighborhood for a while, my boyfriend and I went in to check this place out. After trying a different options each time, we have discovered what we love about this place. A) They remember you and what you order. B) It's better than other \"build your own burrito\" places because there is different options of beans, rice and meats. C) Prices are comparable. I love the guac and sauteed fish/shrimp tacos! My boyfriend is a fan of the carne asada Monster burrito. This is worth a try. If you have trouble with parking in front, park in back and walk up the breezeway in between by potbelly. Parking can be a little difficult in this strip mall in front in peak times. Thanks for your flexibility and remembering us!"}
{"text":"The food was great and what I expected from CT. Fresh tasting, solid seasoning, good portion sizes. 
The only thing that kept this review from being  was the wait time and employee's attitude. 
I've worked in restaurants and I understand that when things get chaotic it's hard to maintain a good flow but from the beginning of our order to when we got our food was 30 minutes. That's 30 minutes of standing in line while the employees were grumbling and angry. One lady was just slamming trays around and kept talking crap about the bearded guy. Like seriously? I don't want to hear that. Bearded guy was actually really nice and was the only employee to make the experience better. 

Fake it til you make it, CT. Put a smile on and it'll help with the wait time."}
{"text":"I came back and it was a good choice. Pork tacos are a little spicy with great flavor. Beef very good too. Get anything you want on good size tacos for around $3. Guac is available no extra charge!!! I will return for the fish tacos."}
{"text":"The food fails to stand out from any other fast casual mission burrito chain. Its good, but not great. The service is pretty good. The ambience is good. 

Overall, since I live nearby, I'll probably be back. It is not worth a special trip, if you're not in the area. Just swing into any chipotle, moes, qdoba, or robertos."}
{"text":"It's always a little messy when I come in but the food is great! They usually have a long wait. The cooks & serves are very nice."}
{"text":"Friendly service and tasty food. I ordered the al pastor bowl and it was delicious! Definitely going to go back for more."}
{"text":"I had a Baja style fish taco fried. Not was a pretty average fish taco, tastes about the same and del taco. The food is cheap and ok for fast but not amazing. The customer service is pretty awful.  Ok place to eat going into the movies but if you have a better choice exercise it!"}
{"text":"The food was....ok. Ordered a beer battered fish taco Baja style and an Al Pastor taco street style with a side of rice. The corn tortillas definitely need to be cooked a little longer or on the grill as mine were cold and falling apart. The beer battered taco had hardly and Baja sauce which made it dry and my batter was burnt. Spanish rice was very dry and flavorless. I also feel the price is not a good representation for what you're getting. 3.50 for a single Al Pastor taco and 4.50 for my fish taco. If you're looking for Mexican style tacos, this is not the place."}
{"text":"This Chronic Taco location has been open at the Palms for a little while now, and I've always been curious as to how it has been since I've seen it. Well, my curiosity was recently killed.

At first glance, what I take this place to be is a place similar to Chipotle and Qdoba by telling the first person what you want, and then going in a line to pick which specific fillings you want in your dish. It seems a little different, and so I thought I should give it a try, why not right? Here, they offer two different kinds of rice, 2 different kinds of beans I believe, and the rest is honestly similar to Chipotle and Qdoba by picking cheese, lettuce, etc. The people helping me out seemed a little impatient and not necessarily happy to be there, and so that was just a little bit annoying to deal with. Compared to Chipotle, I like Chipotle a lot better, and generally, the service is a little bit better too. I more than likely wouldn't come back here, due to similar prices compared to Chipotle and the food is not more authentic than any other place that offers Mexican food. If you're hungry at the Palms, I personally rather just go to Earl of Sandwich, but that's just me."}
{"text":"Just tried this place today...the carne asada taco was super tasty. I was able to add beans and rice to it with no extra charge (only guac is extra). The meat was seasoned well, and not really fatty (I hate fatty meat). My fried shrimp taco was not as good - the shrimp batter was not cooked completely, so it was soggy. I like things cooked well done, so next time I will try the grilled shrimp.  The fried shrimp  burrito we got was very hearty and good!  I like how you can add cabbage to your items.  The tacos were about $4 each, and the burrito was over $7.  I didn't like the service that much. The lady adding ingredients on my items asked me what I wanted on them, the started having a conversation with the cashier. Most of the employees seemed like they didn't want to he there, and needed a 101 customer service class."}
{"text":"I was completely unimpressed with this place.  The tacos were just so-so and the employees were even worse.   We weren't helped right away even though we were the only people in line and when I did order my quesadilla with fajita veggies on it the girl working there actually rolled her eyes like it was the most inconvenient thing in the world.  I will not ever go back here... the hot dogs in the theater are more appetizing than this place."}
{"text":"Good thing the food is great because the service is anything but.  Our office frequently orders online and the order is either wrong or not done at the time it website said it would be and we end up waiting up to 20 minutes for the order. Like I said the food is great and staff is friendly but seem scattered in what they are doing and bounce from order to kitchen to phone then back to your order."}
{"text":"Stopped to get a fish burrito and was informed that that manager wasn't there to cook the fish. He had gone to get breakfast. So I went next door to get sushi."}
{"text":"I was here earlier this evening and purchased a beer while waiting to check into our room at the Palms. The selection was slim & the service poor. I came back for a late dinner after googling that it was open till 3am, and it's closed before 12:30 despite all the spots around it still being wide open. What gives!?"}
{"text":"Great food and price value however their service can be 1 star or 5 star depending upon who is servicing you.
Most days you should be able to get your food as ordered with minimal issues but you'll get a side order of attitude whether you asked for it or not."}
{"text":"The food is overly Americanized, if you are lookin for savory, delicious tacos. Wrong place. Food was over priced and sub par. No bueno."}
{"text":"Can't speak for the food just yet, seeings how I'm actually sitting in my car with the burro I just purchased.....customer service was GREAT until I went to pay!  Apperently the girl working the register at 2:35 pm on this day doesn't like her job one bit!  Rude as could be, and not only to me, but the 4 customers in front of me!  No smile, no kindness what so ever!  Shape up young lady or I fear your job status may change in the near future!  This was my firsr and last visit!  Grunpy people shouldn't work with the public!  Managers....this one will run off more customers than she'll bring in for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Love the cocktails after a long days work and I love the healthy chicken bowls and rice.  The ladies are so sweet every time I am there! I would definitely recommend this place for watching sports, having a cocktail with friends or a healthy bowl of chicken steak rice and all your favorite toppings!  Best fresh food experience in town!"}
{"text":"First visit in and it was not a good one, AT ALL. I decided to try a Carnitas Torta. For those unaware, basically a Pork Sandwich Mexican style. It seemed as though they had no idea what to do. First, the guy up front walks me through what I want on it, then he hands it off to some mysterious person in the back. My GF gets the Veggie Burrito. We also used the special Yelp offer for an order of the Free Mini Churros. The girl at the cash register was very nice but seems a bit stumped by the whole ordeal. So we are told to sit down and they will bring me my Torta. The GF is about 2/3's of the way through with her Veggie Burrito when my Torta magically arrives at our table. All the while her Veggie Burrito is starting to fall apart from all of the juices/oil, we aren't sure. I unwrap my Torta to discover it is one sloppy, congealed mess. Not very appetizing to look at and fell apart at my 1st bite. Flavor was ok but the whole thing was just a disaster. I took it back up and had them make me a Carnitas Burrito. It was marginally better but the same as with my GF's Veggie Burrito, it fell apart about halfway through. And that's about as much as I ate. We dumped the remainder into the trash and agreed never to visit a Chronic Taco ever again.

Then the Store Manager came out. He knew we had a bad experience and wanted to know what all went wrong. He also informed us that this store was the numero uno location in all of Chronic Taco. We told him everything as written above. He also said he was in there with his family trying to have lunch and it was a miserable failure at best. He was a nice enough guy and offered for us to come back at another time after he addresses the issues all free of charge. Not that is the right thing to do. But honestly, there's a whole lotta fixin needs to happen before that place is right. Maybe we will check it out again and give them another chance, but I highly doubt it. Investors, if this is the best store they have, get your money out fast because that ship is sinking."}
{"text":"Have always ordered take out and so far no complaints. 

Some of the employees look a little depressed like they dont want to be there  (u can't really blame them since its a fast food joint), but my orders havent been screwed up yet lol.

Chronic tacos replaced my chipotle cravings and they make their burritos neatly...they aren't Chipotle sloppy and the baha sauce goes with everything."}
{"text":"This is fast food and its located inside the Palms LV food court so don't expect much :)  We were starving from an early flight and our room wasn't ready yet. Since we all love tacos so this was the logical choice to satisfy the hunger. Pick your protein and toppings...Done.

I got the Al Pastor and Carne Asada. Obviously, the ingredients were pre-prepped, as the server scooped them out of the line....Chipotle style. They warmed the tacos, then stuff the meat and top off with whatever veggies, salsa & sauces you ask for. Surprisingly, the meat fillings were not bad at all. It had flavor but served lukewarm. Service was also pretty friendly and prices didn't break the bank. I can go for another round after a night of drinking :)"}
{"text":"I drove by this place many times but on this day decided to stop in and give it a try, i was deeply disappointed. 

The food was warm not hot. The food area storing the food bins were very dirty. The food looked like it hadn't been refilled in some time. 

There was no flavor or seasoning  to the food.
The carne asada had many fatty un edible pieces. 

I would not re turn."}
{"text":"I took my mom out to lunch and we tried Chronic Tacos. I have to say I was disappointed. I got two tacos they were okay but nothing special and a little bit pricey. In fact the only thing I liked was the artwork."}
{"text":"Worst taco restaurant I've ever been to. Stood in line for over 30 mins because the girls behind the counter took their time. One lady was bad mouthing to her coworker about how my fiancé and I because we were putting to many toppings on our tacos. She should not be working there. Then after that she was flicking the cheese off her fingers all over the other toppings. Very poor customer service!!!!! Never coming back again."}
{"text":"I have never felt the need to make a yelp and write reviews but there is always a first. I have been to this location 3 times. Each time I'm hoping it would be better because the food is sooooo good. But the customer service is appalling. On my first visit, the employees stunk of marijuana. I know that it is legal now, but you would think it wouldn't be smoked at work of all places. On my second visit, this employee was completely off putting and seemed like she saw me beneath her. I asked for her name, it was Amari. If it weren't for my kids wanting to eat there, I wouldn't have gone back for a third time. But on my last visit, this employee looked like a complete mess. She was a quite a heavy set girl. She was rude, and very bossy to her coworkers. I believe her coworker called her Theresea. If this is how the owners run their business with employees whose hair is OUT of bun, and rude and high as kite all the time. Then they don't deserve their customers."}
{"text":"Their prices are pretty reasonable for the amount of food you get. I went there with my father and we shared the Chronic Fries and we got a lot. So much that even though we shared it we were both full and almost didn't finish all of it. So I'll probably be visiting again next time I go to the Palms Casino :)"}
{"text":"Easy place to have a quick meal. I think this is the best choice in the Palms Food Court. I ordered two tacos, and like most places you are able to watch them make it. Corn tortillas (my preference), cheese, salsa, etc. Good selections. Tacos tasted good. I would definitely return next time I'm hungry and need a quick meal at Palms. But I can't see myself going to the Palms just to eat here. There are just way too many other better Mexican places."}
{"text":"Gracie made our experience top notch! The food was incredible and her service was unsurpassed. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Happy this place opened so close to me. Love the California burrito with carne asada. Probably the best I've had locally. The prices are competitive to other similar places nearby but the food quality is way better. Less fatty meat and way more flavorful. The only negative I'd say would be how long it takes to get in and out as well as the \"hot sauce\" isn't very good. Fortunate they have bottles of other types available for the customers."}
{"text":"Fish tacos and churro bites are amazing! Good and fast service with great recommendations."}
{"text":"Great customer service and great food. They were very accommodating to certain food requests and didn't charge me full price when I asked for half the amount of guacamole. The nacho fries are amazing."}
{"text":"After posting my initial review, I was contacted by the owner / manager of the restaurant. She apologized for the difficulties that I encountered last time I was there.  She invited me back. When I arrived, Coby immediately welcomed my friend and I. After I told him my name, he quickly put together my order. He also offered to comp my friends meal as well.  I ordered chicken tacos and they were delicious. The chicken tasted fresh the amount of toppings that were put on the tacos were more than expected. The chips tasted fresh as well. Unfortunately, the pico tasted ice cold. Aside from that, we both enjoyed the meal.  Some of the tables and the floor near the drink area was dirty   The restaurant earned my business again and I will return next time I'm in the mood for a juicy taco!"}

The Chronic Tacos

The Chronic Tacos
Eating Chronic to me is like a tradition to me
I gotz to review so sit down and listen to me


Chronic Tacos is a chain taco joint which started out straight out of Newport Beach!  With a name like Chronic; you wouldn't think Newport Beach, but okay!

I came here for lunch with a buddy of mine.  The ordering process is similar to a Chipotle restaurant; pick the style of your meal (i.e. taco, burrito, bowl), then all your choice of protein and toppings.  I went for the regular tacos with Carne Asada and Al Pastor.  As for the toppings I just kept it simple with onions, cilantro, and a side of lime.  The meal also came with a side of avocado and salsa, which I chose the red salsa.  Overall, the topping selection was cool.  I wasn't too crazy about the taco itself.  The salsa was very mild and the corn tortilla was basic.  The protein was cooked correctly and subtle with a clean taste.  Clean meaning I like my taco protein with a fresh off the grill scent and added char.  Nothing over the top in my opinion.

In the end, the place itself is setup with some television screen with some sports flare.  Again, similar to a Chipotle and the food is okay at best.  I think if I need a quick taco bite for lunch and no where else to go; this would be my joint. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here around 5pm...approximately 2 other customers. ..walked to the counter and ordered a burrito bowl and all I saw were leftovers...the server literally gave me the last of the meat, beans and rice left over. ..my husband ordered a bowl and of course same leftovers. ..what I was mainly peturbed about is the measuring of his meat...they took some of the meat out of the bowl , I guess it was too much...I hate restaurants like that. ..don't make this science...just scoop and forget about it...I said geeze, looks like we came at the wrong time since there were only scraps...plus my bill was $27 plus...how ridiculous for old food. ..no thanks! !!!"}
{"text":"When I was in the restaurant I thought for sure it was going to be good. I got a Cali burrito so they fried up some French fries fresh to put in and loaded up this burrito, it was huge. But when I started eating I was very underwhelmed, it's definitely not bad, just average. But when you're an average burrito in Phoenix I'm probably not going back because there's plenty of good burrito spots no matter where you go."}
{"text":"If my favorite San Diego or Tijuana tacos could talk to me:

Tacos: \"What's that smell on you?\"

Me: \"What smell?\"

Tacos: \"Did you cheat on me in Las Vegas?\"

Me: (horrible liar) \"uh... no...\"

Tacos: \"How could you?\"


** What happens in Vegas... OH STOP IT... 

Yeah anyways, actually I'm the one who feels cheated... I mean it's like test driving a Chrysler 300 when you've got a Rolls Royce Phantom at home!!!

After you've already delighted yourself with SD or TJ tacos especially those super flavorful Adobada street tacos, mmm, mmm, mmm, it's just nearly unfair to compare with 'otra cosa' taqueria even if it's another LA/Orange County institution a hundred miles up the road like Chronic Tacos (Las Vegas location, in this case).

For starters, do yourself a favor if you are ever in SD and try this spot right here (you can thank me later):
http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-gordo-chula-vista#hrid:4OAN7amKTy_wgQAiPz2ZQQ

Looks like Mike C (originally from SD) also knows what I'm talking about: http://www.yelp.com/biz/chronic-tacos-las-vegas#hrid:RJNasrlnO69eizLItnicjQ

My sister Alli S, who now lives in Vegas, suggested this taco shop and told me that the tacos were \"Surfer-dude style tacos\"... (I'll give you a minute to think about that one)... uhh, huh?  
So, whatever that means... (haha I love you sis but it looks like you need to come back home to SD lol!)  

Tacos were okay, not bad though I'll say this, this \"Surfer-dude style\" taqueria might be the hippest looking around!  http://eatchronictacos.com/index.php = see what I mean...

You want hip:

Carne Asada tacos was AAIIIGHT!

{"text":"I have had Chronic in California, so glad they are here in summerlin area now!  I think they are great, everything is fresh. Even the beans are not runny or at least they take the time for them to drain. Great tacos and stuff!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito for lunch.. Yum! The service was great and the food was good! Not greasy and so much better than the other Mexican grills around here. I'd go back again, no complaints from me!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Slides my food down the counter when I ask for toppings on a quesadilla. No carne Asada. Expensive for horrible customer service. Won't be returning. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Carne asada meat was very tasty on their chronic nachos I got, they have excellent toppings and many different options to choose on what you want to get like hard/soft tacos, even fries with toppings?! They even had blue moon on draft for 4.75. First time and definitely impressed and recommend this over chipotle any day."}
{"text":"Went there for a quick lunch with my daughter and I loved it. All kids meals come with chips salsa and a drink which is wonderful, I got a simple Asada burrito and I'll surely be back for more! 5 star rating from me. Everything was great! Prices were great as well!"}
{"text":"Tasty but small portion. To be expected I guess in a casino. Prime location right next to the movie theater. Your basic selection of quick order Mexican food. Everything tasted great but just small portions. I guess that's how is inside the fancier casinos like palms."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out after moving nearby - so glad we did. Food was amazing, establishment was clean. But the staff made it great. Daniel is awesome. Great recommendations and personable experience. I'll be a regular for sure. And since all ingredients are top notch - I won't even feel guilty."}
{"text":"Located in the food court of the Palms, this is the only current location in Vegas, but there was a previous one located in the northwest, I believe. It's a Subway-style ordering process where you pick and customize your food along an assembly line. It's fast and prices are slightly high but reasonable.  

This isn't great food, but it's better than your typical fast food joint. Carnitas and carne asada tacos were both under seasoned with flavors muted to appeal to the largest demographic possible. The texture of the meats were so tender that they were bordering on mushy. At least they were generous stuffing the tacos. Larger than typical street tacos, two were enough to fill me up.

With their name and brand they cater to a younger, hipper audience. Franchising is available and unsurprisingly, there are about a dozen that will soon be open in Colorado... talk about a perfect match."}
{"text":"I just love this place! We have been a few times now since living in the neighborhood
and will for sure be back.
I thought it was pretty rad that you could tag up the walls!
If you make a make it a combo then you get a drink, rice and chips and salsa.
I really like the \"Carne Asada Quesadilla\" it is just chocked full of flavor.
The burritos are huge and the tortillas very tasty.
For the 2 of us to eat it averages about $22 and worth every penny.
Give this little gem a try if you haven't yet!
The parking lot can be full depending on the time of day but the way the lot is grouped together it isn't a far walk from wherever you do end up parking."}
{"text":"I wasn't as impressed with this place. We went when they only have one customer and our food was out in less then 10 minutes but our food tasted old. It wasn't as fresh as we expected and we probably won't go back any time soon. The staff was very friendly though and the lobby was very clean as well so that was nice!"}
{"text":"Tuesday tacos $1.99!!! So good. Love this place so much!!! Beer selection is decent...small but decent beers."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Food is fresh and tasty.  I'd definitely come back again when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Read the reviews when it first opened and they weren't great. Husband suggested it tonight and we went around 7pm. It wasn't too busy. Should have listened to my instincts when we walked up and the doors were dirty and full of fingerprints that surely were from more than one day. Windows across the entire front were also dirty. Unfortunately, we went in. While ordering, was not impressed with the less than clean serving area with food dropped everywhere. I ordered two street tacos that cost $3.24 each. Husband ordered a carne asado burrito  and the meat portion was EXTREMELY small (three scoops of what looked to be 1/8 cup scoop or smaller). He asked for extra meat knowing it would be an extra charge. He received one scoop and was charged $2.50 extra. When he questioned it at checkout, the lady apologized and said \"yeah, I know\".  This plus an order of chips and guacamole (container only filled halfway) and one bottle of coke cost over $24. My corn tortillas were stone cold and the meat would not pass required health inspection temperatures. We would been better off at Taco Bell. We won't be back and do not recommend this place.

**response to manager reply**
Thanks for the response. I'm all about family friendly establishments. They can also be clean. 

Ate in the restaurant and my tortillas were not pressed nor did anyone offer to press them. 

A lot of the manager replies to comments talk about what else could have been done to increase the taste and perceived quality and value of the meal. You have a training opportunity here. If your team members actually suggested these things while in front of the customer, you would enhance the experience and reviews. 

I've read several poor reviews and manager replies to them. If you took as much time training your team and enhancing the customer service experience as you do trying to tell everyone how much better you are and comparing yourself to Chipotle, you would have better reviews. Snarky comments and customer blaming show lack of customer service and professionalism."}
{"text":"I've eaten here probably at least twenty times. I just left for the last time and won't be coming back. The food is amazing about 10% of the time, but for months this place has been a trainwreck. Almost all the employees apparently have double digit IQ's and seem lost, confused, and they are hopelessly awkward to interact with. Order your fish taco Baja style and just watch as it becomes a four person meeting trying to remember what Baja style is before they all just give up and ask you what you want on it. The food is crawling with flies and they build orders as they come in, so tortillas and already made items sit on the food line waiting to be paid for. I've stood there in shock watching flies land on food, pans, handles, all as six people in a row get served contaminated food and are too clueless to pay attention to what's going on right in front of them. The flies come in thru the garage door that opens to the patio, which they apparently think is trendy or something even when the place is buzzing with insects like a garbage dump and it's pushing 90 degrees outside. The manager is a really nice guy but seems absentminded, overwhelmed, and just can't get the hang of this place. Today my fish tacos were 9\" long on one taco and 2.5\" long on the other one. The small looked more like a skinny piece of shrimp. Both were chewy and gross. I didn't even eat them. I'm going to Chipotle and Rubios from now on. This place is done taking my money."}
{"text":"I had hoped that this place would be better, but I was very underwhelmed by the food.  
Ordered fish tacos and there was a lot of sauce that sucked and cheese.  Could barely taste the fish.
Very average food that did not impress me.   Go to Rubio's instead."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Food is always delish but they need to work on their quality assurance. One taco had huge blob of guac, the other a tiny bit. The staff moves very slow and they seem somewhat unorganized. We'll definitely go back but hopefully they get it together!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. I had the shredded beef breakfast burrito and it was horrible. No flavor. I tried to add hot sauce and that sucked too. Later I got the worst belly ache."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican fast food restaurants to eat at! Just as good if not better than Chipotle and the serving size is huge! The people are super nice and fun to talk to and they have sports on their TVs which rocks. I always enjoy coming in and watching the Dbacks play while eating one of their burritos!"}
{"text":"So this is a step up from chipotle! Same style with how to order your food. The small burrito was enough to fill me up. Did I mention they have an horchata machine and the churro bites just right !"}
{"text":"Favorite place to get fresh awesome Mexican food. We originally had Chronic in Newport Beach. So excited they are here in the valley. We have it on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"The worst tacos I've ever had. I picked up 3 carne asada tacos for lunch. The meat was overcooked, dry, tough, and fatty. The tacos were cold by the time I sat down. Surprisingly, Chipotle's tacos are far better. The staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My husband loves this place and the last 3 visits have been horrible, first 2 we brushed off, but this last one, we walk in 40 mins till close and the lady on the line tells us, all I can serve is chicken.. okay. Then we leave, we come for the steak. So I call the store still upset and ask for a manger , they don't have those they have shift leads.. okay someone higher then you, no. Try's to offer free burritos that she says are mess ups is what we call them, puts my name down and I can come in on Monday. Granted she tried to take care of it but it's the fact that she told me they close the grill 1 hour prior to closing, well then make sure you have enough food.. bad service. Gray food when they have it!"}
{"text":"Just landed in Phoenix.  Craving for tacos.  Made it to Chronic Tacos.  Really friendly staff.  Very helpful!  Especially with my gluten free allergy.  Grilled veggies are hot off the grill.  Clean, affordable, and really tasty tacos.  Everything was really fresh.  Would most definitely recommend.  Loved the vibe as the garage door is open on a nice day to let the sunshine in.  Great music too.  A must.  Welcome to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Chronic Tacos located on W Peoria Ave shortly after they opened. I know this review is long overdue but better late than never. 
The tacos I ordered were fish and my husband had beef. They were really tasty, hot and delicious. The seasonings on both the fish and beef were really tasty. The owner came by our table and checked on us to make sure everything was OK. He was friendly and personable. The tortilla chips were crispy and the salsa was yummy with nice chunks of tomato and onion.
I would recommended this location for anyone looking for fresh, quality Mexican food."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the quality of the food...very fresh products...friendly staff...fast service....if you are on the go..stop by...this is the best option on the food court"}
{"text":"I've been waiting with bated breath to see which restaurant would occupy the final spot in the shopping center by my house. When Chronic Tacos was announced, I was excited at the prospect of an alternative to Chipotle. Unfortunately, in the vein of Smashburger, Chronic Tacos expects you to pay a premium for subpar food. I can't begin to count the ways paying $9 for a \"California burrito\" is wrong, but soggy fries is definitely one of them.

Customer service is also lacking. This place has only been open for two weeks, but the workers expect everyone who walks through the door to be a veteran. I repeatedly had to ask the server to describe what my options were. No, I don't know that the white cheese is called \"Oaxaca.\" I also had no idea that brown rice wasn't available. 

The ordering system is strange. too. Instead of bringing all the ingredients for menu items to the front of the store, some have to be cooked to order in the back. The result is that you have to step out of line to wait for an item to be cooked to order, then back in when it comes time to tell the food worker which toppings you want.

While I will readily admit that the Chronic Fries are delicious -- and appropriately priced -- I do not feel, having eaten an entire California Burrito, that the price was on point. Chipotle does the same thing for almost $3 less, though with fewer topping options.

In the end, I feel like Chronic Tacos's entire business model revolves around asking customers to pay more to avoid dealing with Mexicans. But if I want good Mexican food, those are exactly the people I want making it! There are also a dearth of cheaper Mexican food options in the area. I will try any restaurant once, but I won't be back here. I can get a California for $4 less right down the street."}
{"text":"Things they need to improve get to 5 stars. Better communication. We told three people in a row that we were having chips and guac. Each one handed us to the next person in the procession but no one put chips in a bag. We sat on the side whilst waiting for shrimp tacos to come out of the back. We saw the tacos come into the window before the staff did and asked them grab and dress them. So check your to go bag. I would recomed that if they don't make it in front of you there may be some micro management in your future. 

This is a very nice way to get Mexican food. Way more choices and variety to chipotle. You can even get fried fish tacos Baja style. And they are amazing! The service is great the toppings are fresh. They have fresh brewed ice tea. The carnitas burrito was very good with the verde salsa and a bit of cabbage added for some crunch. $5 is a bit steep for a shrimp taco but they are quite good."}
{"text":"*Sigh* You know when you really want to like a place, but every time you go you're disappointed until you finally just realize that place sucks?  Chronic Tacos is that place for me.

I wanted to like it because it is a similar concept to Chipotle, but they have more options like quesadillas, nachos, and tortas.  I liked that about the place, but I have found after three visits that the food just isn't that good.  The meat is dry.  The lime rice has no flavor.  The guacamole is brown.  They charge extra for sour cream.  Not to mention that they have GOT to get their assembly line in order.  All the times I have gone, the food has been piled up and I've had to keep my eye on my order because:
(1) they will mix up the orders and try to put other people's burritos with yours so that when you get up to the register, there are magically three burritos they want to charge you for, or 
(2) ask what you want on your nachos when you ordered a quesadilla and you have to tell them multiple times that those nachos aren't yours but that quesadilla that somehow got pushed to the back of the assembly line is.

I also don't like how you have to pay extra for chips and salsa, yet they don't have a slasa bar.  You have to ask the crazed assembly line people for salsa and good luck if you need more salsa, because you won't be able to get back up there without standing in line again.

And then the decor...they encourage you to write all over the walls, booths, napkin dispensers, and even in the bathrooms.  Just gives the whole place a dirty, cheap vibe.  \"Come to Chronic Tacos and be the hoodlum you've always wanted to be!  Draw a penis on the wall if you want!!\"

I tried, I really did, but I just can't find love for this place."}
{"text":"2nd visit - now that we have a better lay of the land we had a much better experience. Helps a lot that the staff was really friendly and measures were implemented to customize our order while we waited for it to cook. Shorter wait time and of course the food was delish. My husband is a huge fan of some of the more authentic Mexican options like al pastor and cotija cheese."}
{"text":"This place is rad. Affordable, with daily specials, and good spicy salsa. The staff is ultra nice, very welcoming and helpful. 1.99 Tacos on Tuesdays. Outdoor seating. AC inside. Help yourself fountain sodas. Clean. Fresh ingredients. Food is served on pizza serving trays with paper on top. It's a cool new way to serve fresh food without heaps of waste. I especially like places that keep their menu simple and totally rock what they serve. I don't get why they aren't 5 stars? It's so good! I've been in Phoenix 24 hours and I've already eaten here twice."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be better than it is. Under cooked red rice. Bland pinto beans. Too many fat pieces in my pulled pork taco. My chicken was decent though I've made better at home. Avocado was the only great item. Service and staff were nice and accommodating outside of forgetting to bring me my chips when they were done since there weren't any made. Won't be back. I'll stick with chipotle"}
{"text":"Best burritos ever. Better than Chipotle and Moes. Fresh ingredients and good flavors. UberEATS also delivers which is an added bonus."}
{"text":"Everything you like about Chipotle but better - better food options, better drink options, better service. We'll definitely be coming back again. CAUTION: May be habit forming!"}
{"text":"OMG so I 1st tried it in California near Redondo beach...(I must say I'm a true Cali Girl) But this place in Phoenix is the best I got a huge salad with chicken and lots of toppings no extra charge! My son got a carnitas taco very nice not greasy it was crispy just the way they are supposed to be ,salsa was very authentic and spicy. I highly recommend Chronic tacos. Chipotle has nothing on these guys this is authentic Mexican Cool style food!!! The staff is awesome and very busy. Love it!"}
{"text":"I use to live within walking distance of a chronic tacos in California and was so excited to find out they were opening one in Arizona since I recently relocated. In my opinion the Carnitas nachos are worth the 25 minute drive however their shipment didn't get delivered supposedly. I then went to order carne asada which was frozen would take an hour to make. This left me baffled because it was 6:45 p.m. They were not busy so they did not run out. So my only option was chicken. I then left hungry and to say I am unsatisfied is an understatement."}
{"text":"Came in about an hour before they closed not knowing what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. All of the people working were super nice and helpful. I ordered the California burrito with carne asada and it was delicious. I like the toppings you can pick to put on everything, there's a much better selection than chipotle in my opinion. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The reviews of this place made me question how good it would be. It resembles chipotle as far as \"style\" you walk in and they warm your tortillas then put your toppings. There's a wide variety of menu items. I ordered two tacos, carne Asada, onion, cilantro, cheese, and a lime. The guy actually squeezed my lime juice on my tacos! Never has any restaurant done that for me before. Amazing. The food was great, restaurant looks very clean, and staff was friendly. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Got a shrimp taco from here to go, it tasted alright.. Well I figured it could be an alternative to chipotle which is why I went here and I was a bit disappointed. The service was ok, seemed like it could have been quicker but honestly the taco I got was tiny and it was like $4-5? Kind of skimping on ingredients and overcharging. I also got the quesadilla which was pretty good but still I would recommend chipotle over this place."}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service, new spot for fast Mexican with a healthier twist. Pastor meat has an awesome chorizo taste with a hint of sweet. Chipotle who???"}
{"text":"***UPDATE 7/27/2010***
I workout at the 24 Hour Fitness next to Chronic Tacos and came out to find Chronic Tacos flyers on the cars in the parking lot, including mine (see pics).  That's lame, taking to sleazy nightclub tactics to promote the business....blech!  One more reason not to go there for me.

***ORIGINAL REVIEW***
I passed by this place yesterday after having lunch at Upper Crust Pizza....it was very busy and looked cool, so I said I would try it the next day.

Well....I stopped by for lunch after a workout at the gym.  It was 12:15 pm and there was a big line of about 20 people.  I decided to wait it out and see what everyone was waiting for.  While I was in line, it grew to about 30 people.

The place is decorated like a teenager's bedroom.  The walls are made of plywood and you are encouraged to tag up the walls with whatever (see pics).  I think the owners are MMA fans because there were MMA magazines all over the place and the guy who brought out my food had a MMA T-Shirt & hat.

Food - I was going to try a Carne Asada burrito, but I wanted to try 2 dishes, so i opted for the Nachos (no meat) and a Carne Asada Fatty Taco.  It's a typical setup like you find at Qdoba/Zaba's/Chipotle where you order your food and you move down a line of people to add the toppings.

The Carne Asada Taco ordering process went smoothly, but the Nachos didn't....they forgot to make it as they rely on someone in the back who's not part of the assembly line to make it.  They yell out the order and I guess someone is suppose to pay attention and make it....well, they didn't.  No big deal at this point, it's only Nachos and it doesn't take a long time to make those....so, they told me when I paid that they would bring it out.

I had a pretty good workout and built up a huge appetite, so I scarfed down the Carne Asada Taco while I waited for the Nachos.....it was pretty good, not great but good....nice flavor but it wasn't \"authentic\".  i guess growing up in SoCal makes you a Mexi-Snob when it comes to Mexican Food.

After a few minutes my Nachos came out....I was surprised to see that there was only cheese on top of chips.  Normally at Baja Fresh/Qdoba/Chipotle/Zaba's nachos are fully loaded with all the toppings....hell, I even paid extra for guacamole.  I asked the guy who brought them about it, he apologized about the guac and said he would come back with a cup of it....but he said that's how the Nachos with no meat are prepared, with just cheese.  What a disappointment!

To make matters worse, the cheese is shredded cheese that they melt on top of the chips....that in and of itself isn't that big a deal....what was really a big deal is that the cheese wasn't fully melted, just the top of it so it didn't stick to the chips and it fell all over the place because it was still cold and shredded underneath (see pics for details).  The guacamole was bland too.  I still ate it because I was hungry.  What a bad meal....I should have went somewhere else.

The place was crowded and the majority of the people in there were younger (early 20's and teens)....I guess they like the atmosphere.  Since I don't follow MMA at all, it didn't appeal to me.....and the years of writing crap on the walls are decades behind me.

I would have rated the place 2 Stars if the line was shorter...but because the hype was built up and it didn't deliver, I gave it 1 Star.  It's the 1st 1 Star joint I've rated.

Will I return?  Nah.....unless someone else was paying the bill."}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment 3 different times.  Every time I enjoyed the food and think that their fish/shrimp tacos are great!  That's the reason I went back two additional times.  The problem however was in how long it took me to get said fish tacos.  The first time it was roughly 10 minutes which is reasonable except we were the only people in the restaurant as we went about 4pm on a random Wednesday.  The second time it was busier and took over 18 minutes.  I know because my husband and I were on our lunch break from work and had a limited amount of time.  We actually had to ask the desk two separate times where the tacos were.  The situation was sort of rectified in that they gave us free churro sticks for the inconvenience.  My tipping point was tonight, My husband was there with our four children.  He ordered his two fish tacos and waited 20 minutes while roughly 10-12 other people got their food, ate and LEFT the restaurant.  He then went up to the desk asked about the tacos and was reassured they would be \"right out in 5 minutes\"  after another 13 minutes he was so upset he went up to the counter and said, forget the tacos, I'll just take a refund.  THEN they STILL made him wait to get his refund as they were busy helping other people in line.  They didn't take him straight to the register, no they said sorry it will \"just be a minute\".  My husband is a very kind and patient man.  He decided after several ADDITIONAL minutes that the money, nor the food was worth it as our FOUR children had been waiting very patiently.  He decided to leave.  After he was at the car loading up and putting the kids in their car seats an employee ran out trying to apologize.  He did give my husband his money back and the two fish tacos that he waited nearly 40 minutes for.  However my husband was so frustrated he couldn't even eat them.  An additional problem we had was that during this extremely long wait the televisions in the restaurant were playing a very gory, bloody, violent womens boxing match.  I have seen in other reviews that the owner says his place is a great place for kids.  Sorry but that is not what I want my elementary aged children watching.  It's also not what I want to be watching while I'm eating my food.  Sorry Chronic Tacos but you have officially lost a customer for however long you last."}
{"text":"This place was a nightmare. I want to chicken tacos. But there was a 20 minute wait on chicken. So I ordered something more simple, a breakfast burrito. Which also took 20 minutes. I was never informed breakfast burrito would take that long. When my friend was done eating, is when I finally got mine. And it definitely was not worth the wait. I do not recommend eating here. Horrible service. They never apologized. And the food was just not OK."}
{"text":"I try to come in & order something else. I really do. My heart & tummy yearn for the carne asada Chronic fries with black beans, rice, lettuce, cheese, Pico, lots of lime & cilantro. Tip: ask nicely if the fries can be fried crispier to stand up to all the tasty goodness soon to be piled on top. You're welcome."}
{"text":"First time trying Chronic tacos and I loved it. I had the carne asada torta, and it was great! The meat was well cooked and the bread was great too, it didn't get all soggy like some tortas do. Next time I'll try their burritos and see how that goes.."}
{"text":"Same concept as Chipotle, food was ok, I'm yet to try their fish and shrimp tacos. Service was very slow, although it seemed they were trying their best, one guy in particular had a happy personality which made a difference. All the employees were acting nicely. The lobby was very hot, and I understand the temperature outside was 108 F, but they could have lowered it about 5 degrees in the dining area."}
{"text":".Taco tuesday and nobody does it better in Las Vegas, super friendly staff, they always get your order right and what? They have a bar here too...beers and tacos, nothing better. #getchronic #chronictacos"}
{"text":"Quick and AMAZING food. I recommend the beer battered fish tacos. They are the best I've had, probably ever.  The atmosphere is nice and the music is great. The staff is very friendly and make ordering easy too. Great experience. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Went in earlier today and Moses helped me decide on what I want. He suggested to get their delicious \"California burrito\" with carne asada and it was one of the best burritos i've had in a while!! Can't wait to go back! Thank you Moses"}
{"text":"I'd say this place is pretty good. I agree with some of the other reviews that's it's not a unique concept nor is the food extra special, but it is good and the portions are large. I grossly underestimated the size of the sautéed shrimp tacos (Baja style)by ordering three, I could barely eat one. I would also agree that I'd come back but not likely that I'll crave something specifically from here. So far as the service or availability of food, keep in mind that this location just opened and will be working out the kinks for a bit. The space is nice, nicely decorated, clean, open and friendly."}
{"text":"The food was great but this isn't about the food. This is about the honest of the 5 employees working tonight. I forgot my wallet on one of the tables. That's one thing but the fact that it was filled with $1,000 is another. I will be honest when I made it home and realized my wallet was missing with that amount of cash I was very skeptical that I would find my cash still in there when I went back. But, every last dollar was in there. I am speechless that in today's world 5 people can all be honest. I appreciate your employees, they showed great character and most importantly the honesty. I don't think I can say that if that wallet was left at some other food place that that money would still be in there. Kudos to your store and your employees. I am forever great full but more impressed with the honesty. You don't see that every day and today I will always remember this and your store. Thank you. You allowed me to believe that honesty has. It been forgotten."}
{"text":"Tried Chronic Tacos for dinner tonight with the Groupon I've had for a bit.  Went with my girlfriend, and we split baja fish taco and a chicken burrito with a drink and chips.  Entire order was under our $12 Groupon, so decent value.  Food was just OK.  Actually, the chicken burrito was pretty tasty once I put Tapatio on it.  But the baja fish taco was a bit underwhelming.  Bonus points for having Coke Zero, though.  I hate when places only have Diet Coke."}
{"text":"i love this place although I am not a fan of having to go into a casino..at least it's located right next to the parking lot... i usually get carne asada tacos but this last week I was at their Taco Eating Contest and tried their chicken tacos... damn good with a little bit of Gringo Bandito green sauce!"}
{"text":"This place is our go to spot for Taco Tuesday! The food is always fresh and delicious and the staff is very helpful and attentive! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for quality food at a super affordable price."}
{"text":"You ever go somewhere and wish you never had? Unless you are high out of your mind -- or with a tasteless palate developed over years of abuse/being a frequent patron of McDonald's and Taco Bell -- you will feel this same way after patronising Chronic Tacos. 

Note: most of the patrons in queue were one or the other, or in both states. 

This place fucking sucks. 

The service sucks and is at a snail's pace.
The food sucks.
The food sucks! 

Wait, did I get that twice? 

The pricing sucks. 

Why would I pay more for bland[er], shitty food than Roberto's*? Stop. 

I ordered the chicken burrito and got the worst burrito I have gotten outside of SYSCO-supplied military chow halls. This is the type of shit one would expect served in prison, not at an establishment one is actually paying to eat at. 

*If I want bland shitty Mexican, I go to my nearest Roberto's.

Rating: Barely two stars, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" 
Extra star for not killing me by way of food poisoning. Merry Christmas."}
{"text":"We were there yesterday and they have only been open a day.  That being said, wow it was hard to order and communicate.  The food barrier is too high and although the food servers are friendly, they struggle to hear you and remember what you said.  They need training on the menu.  I had a chicken taco and a potato taco.  The chicken taco was good but the potato was deep fried and came from the back, then sealed shut so you can't really add salsas and fresh toppings.  My b/f got the meat torta and did not like it.  The meat had little flavor and it was packed with white rice??? And no guacamole; he was almost angry about a torta stuffed with rice.  We will try again because the menu was good and I think they are just experiencing newness with the staff."}
{"text":"I came in for a veggie bowl and they have some kind of sign stating that they are out of guacamole because there is a shortage of avocados. However, not true nor an issue at other locations? 

Update : they still are out of guac and lied to me about a cooperate shortage. 

Please get avocados in"}
{"text":"I've had Chronic Taco twice and I actually enjoy the food. I feel like it's better than Chipotle and the ingredients are more authentic. My three star review can be attributed to one of the employee interactions I had. When I was picking the ingredients for my burrito, she asked me what cheese I wanted and I asked her what type they had. She listed the names and I didn't understand what she said so I asked her to repeat it. She looked at me and repeated it in a way that made me feel like I shouldn't have even asked to begin with. I try to give people working in retail the benefit of the doubt because I worked in retail for years but sometimes the attitude is really uncalled for."}
{"text":"I don't understand all these negative reviews.  This place is bomb! I got tacos and chips here on my way out of the Palms, and even after my 20 minute drive home, the food was delish!  The carne asada in the tacos was tender and full of flavor and the .  I wish I lived closed to the hotel so I could eat here more often!"}
{"text":"Talk about great customer service, Jarret helped us out and took exceptional care of us! They all have such great attitudes and are very helpful and welcoming. We will definitely be back. Thanks again Jarret, you deserve a raise and should be bumped up to manager!"}
{"text":"The first Chronic Tacos I had ever been to was in DANA POINT CALI. I was so excited to find out they were here in AZ.  This is a franchise, they are supposed to use the same recipes and they clearly DO NOT. The baja sauce was like tarter sauce-just awful.  The ingredients were not fresh either.
I decided to try the location on BELL-it was awesome! You have to try the baja style beer battered shrimp tacos-heavenly. I will be going to the location on BELL at least once a week.
Peoria location needs to get retrained on the recipes or hire people who arent slackers.
DONT GIVE UP on CHRONIC-try the other location on Bell first!!"}
{"text":"YES!! Thank you for opening here in AZ!!
My first Chronic Taco was in Dana Point-they were ON POINT!! I was so excited to try them here in AZ. The beer battered shrimp tacos baja style are amazing!
I tried the location on Peoria-it was disgusting. Since this is a franchise is there anything you can do to tell the owners they arent following the recipes? Its giving you guys a bad name.
I will be visiting you guys ON BELL at least once a week-I'll be gaining some weight here. LOL
Thanks for opening up in AZ and following the same recipes as Dana Point does.

Chronic Tacos ARE chronic!! :)"}
{"text":"have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a freegan?  you know, those people that raid dumpsters for the food that restaurants throw away.  well, you're in luck!  go to chronic tacos in the the palms and for only 8$ you can get a hot bag of garbage prepared just for you!  my recommendation [because it was my first (and last) time there] is the burrito.  first, wait for an employee - all of which obviously don't want to be there.  then, when on meanders over they'll ask what you want with their back to you so that you can't hear them.  guessing games are fun!  after they repeat themselves slightly louder, cup an ear because that wasn't the last time they'll whisper under the cacophony of casino games blaring 50 feet away.  it doesn't matter what you tell them you want in it.  it'll all sucks.  the carnitas (is that plural?) have no flavor and are kinda crunchy.  but hey, gotta get that prot, bruh.  the rice is next level - in that it's not just cruchy; it's chip your teeth like it's christmas pepermint candies hard.  do you like cheese?  too bad.  they only have white and yellow shredded paper.  get it anyway if you need to up your calorie intake for the day.  the mild salsa was good."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were very excited to try this place out. Never making the mistake of eating here again! We walked in,  place seemed okay,  then  we stood in line with one person in  front of us for about five minutes. When it was finally our turn to order the lady was very pleasant. I wish I knew her name,  she was the only thing about the place that wasn't terrible. As we move on down the line adding to our tacos and burrito the staff behind the counter seemed very disgruntled and was very rude to not just myself but the customer in front of us. When it was time to pay,  we waited about another 5 minutes for my girlfriends burrito to be ready. She ordered a shrimp burrito which for some reason takes extra long to make. $20.35 later and I was left with cold tacos,  stale chips,  and a burrito where the shrimp tasted off. As if overpaying for crap food wasn't bad enough,  the dining area was filthy. Food trays and wrappers left all over the place,  food crumbs and mess littered table tops as well as seats. We found the only place that wasn't filthy. While eating we saw four employees take a break almost at the same time. One kid who worked there walked around and picked up trays,  then went outside never to be seen again. Food crumbs still everywhere. One employee sat fairly close to us,  kicking back,  on break I assume. So it wasn't a mystery to staff that this place looked like a train wreck. Bottom line,  I will never come here again,  and I will be sure to tell all of my friends in this area to never come here."}
{"text":"Love it  I got my food inspiration from AZ foodie on instagram and was not disappointed"}
{"text":"I walked in 10 min before closing I hate doing that, I asked what time do they close and the older guy in the register answered we are still open. I came in the service was great, awesome Mexican food. Food was hot and my plates where ready in no time even tho they looked like they where getting ready to close. Will definitely come back and will recommend it to friends and family."}
{"text":"It's not closed but it should be. I ordered the cArne Asada burrito and I am not kidding it smelled like vomit. I took one bite and it was the nastiest burrito i think i have ever eaten. The meat these like it was cooked in lime and it was so dry the tortilla was not even warm. This place is nasty I returned the burrito don't care about the money. But I let them know their food was disgusting,"}
{"text":"Good food. Great alternative to Chipotle. Price vs portions are resonable. 

Line was resonable, but I was in at a slower time.

Did ask the Manager about some of the reviews saying the lines are bad. They are aware of the issue and are looking to change some things."}
{"text":"Very good food!! My fiancé and I love their chronic tacos and burrito. Chipotle and fillibertos have nothing on this place! We will continue to come back here. They have amazing taste, a fair price, and good portion size. If you are in the mood for a little Mexican, check this place out!"}
{"text":"The worst service...we waited 15 minutes to be served and was ignored. Only two girls taking and making orders. They totally ignored us as they filled others orders. This was my daughter and mine first time here and probably the last time we go there. They could not even greet us as we waited right there in front of them so our business went elsewhere. There was a black guy that was waiting when we got there and they paid him no mind but we watched several hispanic men go up and ORDERED...i am not one to pull racism but it sure felt like it...i really hope not cause that not the way to run a company in my book. We will never go back so they lost a potiential regular customer."}
{"text":"This place was so good . My parents and I went there . They have  great menu and  drinks. I had a tasty  Tostasda  bowl. It was enough to eat ."}
{"text":"i liked the customer service. we were greeted with a smile and the cashiers were really accommodating so that actually gets 5 stars. i took two stars off though bc the tacos are overpriced. for 4 and a large drink, it was $18.50. the fish taco wasnt well seasoned. i got it to go and had to put hot sauce on it when i got home to give it flavor. the hot sauce i got with my carne asada tacos was pretty gross. it didnt taste like salsa at all.  the portions are big but ive had better tacos from bonitas for example which is a small hole in the wall restaurant off 51st and thunderbird."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh, authentic Mexican food. I get the fajita veggie salad bowl almost every time I come.   They always grill the veggies fresh and the hot sauce is FiRE!!! Best Ghost Pepper Sauce in Las Vegas BY FAR! The restaurant itself is always nice and clean, always an enjoyable experience. Thank you Chronic Taco!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  Team needs a manager, and some more time/experience under their belt.  Very slow and disorganized and chaotic in the \"assembly line\".  Great atmosphere, great prices, great food."}
{"text":":-) Hi Brad

Thanks for \"reaching out.\" First and foremost, it was not my intention of \"body shaming\" anyone, I was simply describing her without using race....maybe if she had a nametag?

What I find interesting, though is that you knew your employee was having a hard time, yet decided to stay and count the money. Where's the leadership in that? Secondly, you knew I was there, so why didn't you offer an apology at that time, come to see how I was doing, or simply check on your staff??? No wonder my experience was negative. GOOD day"}
{"text":"Chronic Tacos isn't a horrible food court option, but it's not exactly good either. I stopped by for a quick bite before a movie at the theater right next door. It was Taco Tuesday so the food was pretty cheap. 

I'd give the food about 1.5 stars but I bumped up the star rating a bit because of three things: 1. the pico de gallo was super fresh and super good with big, red ripe tomatoes and crunchy onions; 2. it was super cheap since it was taco Tuesday; and 3. it was easy to communicate with the employees: they understand what a low carb bowl means. It was easy to get my taco served in a bowl with no tortilla. Easy! 

I do have to agree with other Yelpers that the food is WAY too salty. If you are sensitive to salt, I don't see how you could ever eat here. I had the carne asada and it literally tasted like the meat had been boiled in salt water and then salted several times after it was cooked. The only flavor profile I really tasted was \"salt.\""}
{"text":"Best taco place we have ever been to!  The staff was very nice and friendly.  The concept is like Chipotle but the food is WAY better!!  My husband had a fish and shrimp burrito and loved it!  I had a chicken taco and fish taco and Spanish rice!  SO delicious!  It was very clean and comfortable too.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good and the quality is great. The first time I came here it took me about an hour to get an order of nachos. I got there around 6ish and it was busy but not as busy as chipotle is. I order my nachos and they put the chips rice and cheese on top and place it in an oven. The man then proceeds to take the order of the couple behind me while my nachos are cooking. Then the couple behind them. Meanwhile the guy at the register sees that I am irritated and asks what I had. I told him I had the nachos. He takes them out and asks if they are too burnt for me I say yes and he makes another one. Then they feel bad and give me churros. Decided to give them another try because their nachos were good. It wasn't as busy the second time. I decided to try their tacos which again were delicious. My husband got a bowl which was also very good. Quality of their food is amazing. Clean place. I believe this place would do even better if they hired brighter employees. They are very slow and lack common sense and don't know how to manage a busy crowd."}
{"text":"I like Chronic Tacos food but today the service left me with a bad taste in my mouth.  I walked up and ordered a taco with the meal option.  The girl proceeded to make my taco and took my taco to the cashier.  I told the cashier I wanted the meal with it.  The girl was still standing there and rolled her eyes at me then sighed like she was annoyed.  I just told her and the cashier, yeah, I wanted a meal option like I said the first time when I placed my order.  I will not be going back anytime soon.  I am local and made a special trip to the Palms for the food.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Nope not coming here ever again. Chicken bowl and shrimp bowl was the order. Staff did a good job but I got 2 small pieces of chicken and the wife's shrimp where awful looked like the already cooked Two pound frozen pack from smiths. but maybe we shop at the same place.  clean and friendly but sorry"}
{"text":"Please stop referring to this place as a \"California\" taco shop, the only thing Cali about this place is it's reference to a certain drug in it's name.  The place looks like a tatoo parlor, nothing \"surfer\" about it.  The food was just eh and they do not even have a salsa bar.  NO self-respecting real mexican joint goes without a salsa bar. 

I ordered the beef flautas and a cheese quesadilla.  This is comman fare in any mexican stand.  The flautas were actually very good, generous amounts of meat in them and happily not over cooked.  They were crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.. but not very flavorful, you definitely need guacamole or salsa with them.  The quesadilla was a flop.  Their first attempt at my quesadilla resulted in one that was so over cooked that the line cook could not cut it with his knife.  He had to saw into it and he ACTUALLY thought he was going to serve this to me.  I looked at the cashier and said, \"don't you think that's over done\".  She immediately told the cook to make another one.  Take two - this time the cashier stood over the grill and cut it up herself for me.  I think the problem here is they are making the quesadilla's in a panini grill and it toughens the tortilla before the cheese melts fully.  Any decent cook knows to make them on the grill and flip them, this way the tortilla doesn't have a chance to dry out and the cheese has time to melt.

I'll wait to go back to San Diego and have real mexican food rather than go back to this place.

NOT TO FORGET:  A plain cheese quesadilla is 5 bucks, WTF?"}
{"text":"I ordered a salad, nothing really looked appetizing. I can say I was a little disappointed. They do have a bar though."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and the first time was probably the most AMAZING experience we've ever had. Everyone was talkative and friendly, the staff was quick to serve us, and the food was phenomenal. 

However, this past time was just okay.  

Don't get me wrong, the food was good (although it would've been great if my burrito was wrapped a little tighter so I didn't have to eat the last part with a fork ), the service was fast but the atmosphere was kind of...intense. Definitely a huge difference from the first time we went there. The staff were pleasant but you could tell that having the bosses/owners there (two males, an older and a younger male, both dressed nicely and drives a nice SUV) created a quiet, reserved and heavy feeling in the restaurant. It was like you almost want to tell everyone to lighten up and it was okay to have fun at work, talk to your customers and be yourself around your bosses. We enjoyed ourselves more the first time because the staff was more outgoing and easier to interact with. That's what made the first experience incredible for us. Needless to say, we'll still be back. But maybe a note to the owners that it would be a good idea to lighten up a little and a small \"Hello\" or \"How was the food?\" to the customers would go a long way. 

On a side note, the younger white guy who was working the cash register was very polite, showed interest in our experience, carried on a nice conversation and we appreciated that he was cleaning when there weren't any customers to take care of. And the girl with the blonde braids was also very nice and made the best quesadilla we've ever had.  

Looking forward to our next meal there!"}
{"text":"Great little place!  I had a battered shrimp taco Baja style and a carnitas taco, with chips and salsa.  Both were very good!  One minor complaint was how messy they were to eat...small shells filled to overflowing with goodies made it extremely difficult to eat, got lunch all over my hands trying to eat and just generally made a mess.  Loved the generous fillings, though!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Chipotle clone with a cool name.  Boring with below average food.  I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"This place has some bubonic chronic tacos that made me choke shiiiii.  Just messing around and referencing an old school Snoop Dogg song.

Great burritos, tacos and service.."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with our first experience here. From the slow service to the \"cluster F\" ordering system, to the bland food. 

We arrived behind 1 person placing their order, and waited. And waited... And waited.... And waited... Not sure if new staff was the issue, or the fact that the poor folks on the assembly line had to keep walking over one another back and forth due to the terrible logistical layout of the prep area. Dishes would pass back and forth through a window into the kitchen or into the mini broiling toaster. Meanwhile people waiting for their dishes to be ready must navigate the flow (albeit slow flow) of other customers who ordered something that was \"at the ready\" moving down the line. They have two topping bars setup for the employees to use, with only one seemingly being used during our visit. The second station appeared to be a waste since they couldn't have been much busier and no one touched anything on it. 

I got the Chronic Fries, which took about 10 total minutes to make. I'm not joking. I stood in line fighting people walking by me in line for 10 minutes. 10 of the longest minutes of my life, watching other people get their food. 

The process starts out calling the order back through the window. 30-45 seconds or so later someone drops a handful of frozen fries into the fryer. (Frozen? Maybe I'm spoiled from In N Out freshly cut fries. Maybe I'm not and frozen fries should be abolished.) 3 minutes or so go by and my fries are out of the fryer and placed into a pan and placed in the window to cool like a hot pie right out of the oven. And they sit there. And I continue to stand in line watching my fries sit there. Another minute or two go by and someone notices my fries sitting there. \"Anyone order fries?\" they call out. So we get it loaded up with some toppings and cheese and then it goes back into this mini broiler back by the kitchen window. And my fries sit there, and broil, at least that was the intention. Not sure how well the thing works since after about three minutes they take them out with the cheese not fully melted and ask if it's melted enough for me. If I hadn't already been in line for about 10-12 minutes now, I would have loved to have my cheese fully melted, but I was emotionally checked out at that point. 

The second star was earned solely based off the pork which was decent albeit a little dry, but sadly not decent enough to ever return."}
{"text":"I just want to say you're all wrong this place is amazing and it's the best food of my life and that's it."}
{"text":"Fresh food and excellent customer service. First time here and won't be the last, you need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff and amazing portions. This is by far the best food I've had. Will be recommending this place to all my friends and family. Give this place a chance you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"It's my first time ordering from Chronic Tacos a little bit disappointed the beans were dry the burrito was dry over all the flavor wasn't bad but I think Taco Bell is better"}
{"text":"If you are craving luke warm food with rude employees then this is the place for you.  Having eaten at several of the South OC locations (San Clemente, and MV when it was open) they were all good.  This place-- oh yuck.  No flavor, barely warm food.  There's no way it's healthy to have food that's not hot when serving it."}
{"text":"I have been there 3 times now. I really like it. The staff is great. The food is tasty and you have to have the baja sauce. I had the carne asada tacos a couple times and today I had the beer battered fish. It is really good. Ordered 2... could only eat one. Pretty good size tacos. I saw a couple of my coworkers come in when I was sitting in there. When I got to work they were eating these HUGE tasty looking burritos. 

Yes they have other meats but I probably won't stray to far from the carne asada and fish. Might have to give in to the chicken though. 

Thanks staff. You guys are great."}
{"text":"Presentation is everything and I was not pleased with the visceral experience here. 

First steps inside and there is an awful sewage like smell.

Pretty much killed my appetite to be frank."}
{"text":"Bad prices, poor food, and crappy service. I was expecting fast food Mexican like Chipotle or Rubios, which is hard to fuck up, but this food was bad and the staff was rude. I feel like I wasted my money. I'd rather eat at Taco Bell. Save your self the time and money and go to one of the 4 other Mexican places within a quarter mile: Taco Bell, Chipotle, Filibertos, or Garcias."}
{"text":"Chronic Tacos.....is pretty delicious. I decided to go with the Chicken Taco and a Carne Asada Taco...while making it a meal. They have two options a combo with a drink and salsa with chips or a meal with chips and salsa, beans, rice and a drink. The wait time was a lil long for a \"fast food\" type of joint, but it was worth the wait. The fiancé ordered the Chicken Burrito and that thing was huge! The chicken was definitely moist and tasty, my favorite out of the two. The lime rice was awesome and the mild salsa was a tad bit spicier than what I think a mild salsa should be, but I am a wimp when it comes to spiciness. Overall, I think this might be a place to go to for some yummy tacos and I definitely will be back to try more tacos!

P.S. Someone recommended the flautas too!"}
{"text":"PSA: There will be strong language ahead.

Holy shit this place is amazing. Allow me to break it down to you. The people are awesome. One of the line cooks brought my girlfriend's to go order to the table so we didn't have to stand awkwardly and wait for the other part of our order. They were all real friendly, incredibly helpful with reccomendations for first timers. The food, oh God the food. Authentic taste, very well seasoned meats, fresh veggies, everything was so well put together. The damn burrito was the size of my forearm. And I plowed through 3/4 of that thing when I should have stopped at half of it, it was that tasty. The place is real clean, stations are kept tidy even during a dinner rush. We will for sure be return customers. They will know us by name by the end of this summer."}
{"text":"There's no good reason to get a burrito from this place, I've never had a chode burrito, practically square, all the ingredients that had been layered now all over the place so each bite was strongly flavored with the ingredient in that pocket, next bit down different again.  The tortilla was, I'm sure papyrus, or maybe the dried-skin of a truck-stop lot-lizard but it wasn't that appetizing either. I was hoping for another Brushfire like experience but the idea of driving by Rolando's to eat here again, not happening. 


Oh and it was barely warm enough to melt the cheese , the side order of the potato taco was cold , having sat the entire time the order was being made. You have to admire their commitment to running a business as if stoners called the shots though:)

Two reviews in a week?  Blame the water heater failing for this renewal of eating out:)"}
{"text":"Glad to see Chronic Taco come to the valley. Love the soda machines too."}
{"text":"This place is pretty yummy!

I came here bc my friend wantef some enchiladas. Here you get 2 for 4.99$ with any meat. I ordered a chicken burrito but it looked gross so the girl was such a sweetie and let me get something else. Instead I ordered 2 potato tacos with cheese and a kids meal with chicken taquitos for my son. After paying I heard a man ordering some carne asada fries and I was like \"hold up!\" She said its on their \"secret menu\" so I got an order of those.

My friend said his enchiladas were good. My sons taquitos were also very very good and he loved the chips and salsa. I tried my potato tacos and I was like YAY! They were super delish! The carne asada fries (7$) were also very yummy! The only thing that sucked was they dont come with guac, its 1$ extra and also you have to like yell over the glass thingy.

All in all the food was yummy and cs was awesome!"}
{"text":"review back down to 1 star after a 25 minute drive to locked doors at 7:49pm..

lets put that into perspective 25 minutes each way almost a hour travel time because some lazy employee wants to go home early. Thats one hour of my life ill never get back and $20 in fuel down the drain..As a business owner myself I don't see how a corporation can allow employees to shut down early and still be successful"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and fresh! The chipolte sauce is to die for and the staff was so friendly!"}
{"text":"I tried this to compare to my other favorite casual Mexican fare, and I think I may have just found a new favorite!

I had a salad with fajita veggies, guac, beans, and salsa and it was so fresh and flavorful. Their fajita veggies are more than onions and green peppers, they were yellow, orange, green and onion. So delish!

The staff was amazing and friendly and the price point was great!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and I must say I'm disappointed.  The first time I visited was for lunch and the line was so long, waiting over 30 minutes in line just to order, seemed a bit unorganized, but I chalked it up to being brand new.  Second time was even worse.  Waiting in line way too long again,  things go so chaotic as far as who ordered what as some things must be ordered from the kitchen, which means you are waiting longer than a person behind you....staff doesn't know who ordered what.  Utter chaos.  I probably will not be back, even though the food is really good, I can't deal with the chaos.  The food line was also really dirty yesterday, and I saw an employee take a huge scoop of something out of the salsa and throw it in the trash, and then use that same salsa to dress tacos.  No thanks."}
{"text":"I am happy that Chronic Tacos has made its way to AZ. I am used to seeing this establishment in Cali, and I am a fan simply because they get that a lot of people prefer all white meat chicken. The nearby competitor has not gotten that message. My suggestions would be to make sure that the meat is always warm and to add another person into the serving rotation. It was a bit slow for the after 1pm lunch hour. I think they give you a lot of meat even for Taco Tuesday. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I would recommend not ordering online. It clearly doesn't relay the info to the employees correctly. They made my fried burrito and cooked quesadilla with sorry cream inside. Gross!!! Nothing like boiled sour cream on your food. The potato taco was cold, so soggy it fell apart and basically inedible. Also when you order online you're required to leave a tip. I tip regularly but why is it required??
As for the inside it was dirty. The counter was covered in food and the employees didn't seem concerned about at least wiping them off. The floor was filthy. A Coke employee was literally using a cup to shovel water that was leaking from the machine. 
With this being said the flavor of the food was good. Maybe I'll try it again but not a good first experience"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised that these taste much better than chipotle! The small burrito is the perfect size. Ive already been here twice in the past few days. My 6 year old says they're bomb lol. Definitely a new favorite of ours. Welcome to the neighborhood Chronic Taco!"}
{"text":"My husband and I still love this place, I wanted to comment because the attitudes and customers service from the staff is always 'ok' but the other day I was there and the associate at the register gave me the best customer service I have ever had.
I believe his name was bobby, he was tall and working on wednesday 05/17/17.
Even as I sat down to wait for my meal I watched his interaction with other customers and It just made me smile. 
I wish everyone acted like this guy when they are on the clock. If you dont love your job let someone else work it that will!"}
{"text":"Beyond awful.

A friend and I went to the Palms to see a movie and we always go early to grab a bite.  The hot dog place went out of business so we decided to try this place.  Bad mistake.

First of all, they were out of actual hard taco shells....pretty ironic for a place with \"taco\" in their name (and this was before noon so I don't how how they would have run out).

So, I got the soft shell with pork.  The meat was the driest I've probably had in my life.  Tasted like it had been sitting there for a week.

They also asked it I wanted mild, medium or hot sauce.  I asked for the hot.  I've had ketchup that had more kick/taste than their \"hot\" sauce.  It was beyond lame.

Will never waste my money on this place again."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try Chronic Tacos since the name has come up so often in my household by my wife due to her affiliations with the owner. I was driving down Bell road when I saw them out of the corner of my eye. I had to stop.
When I walked in the menu set up reminded me of Chipolte (no insult intended) but far better. I decided to get three tacos, one carne asada, one pollo and one al pastor on corn tortillas Baja style. They were all awesome with amazing flavor. I finished them in no time. 
This particular location is fairly new and was very clean and the staff was very friendly. Unfortunately they don't have a location where I live, but anytime I am down in this area I will definitely stop by for my taco fix.
Forget Chipolte people.. Chronic Tacos put them to shame."}
{"text":"Finally, this place has opened up. I didn't realize it had opened up already so I was pleasantly surprised when I was getting some froyo and saw people inside.  Plus it was taco Tuesday so even better. Chicken and asada were good, al pastor was amazing. My son had the quesadilla which you can't really go wrong with, at least to a finicky 3 year old. My only thumbs down is th at there are no juice or milk selections for the kids menu. Have to go with fountain drink options which I'm not a fan of. HOWEVER, I will say I was way impressed when the girl managing for the guys in the back to make him some fresh pineapple juice. Amazing service for them to even think of doing that for us. I would prob also like it if you had the option to get rice and /or beans instead of chips with the kids meal. 
Bottom line is, food is delicious, quirks are expected when a place just opens up so I won't harsh ice tea machine not working. 
Can't wait to be back for some yummy fish tacos"}
{"text":"The tacos were okay. However, I ordered a beer and the cashier said nothing else about receiving the beverage. Ten minutes turned into twenty without the drink, after asking again about the drink they said they were out of that specific beer. I asked the cashier if she could return the amount for the beer and I would just buy a fountain drink. She then replied with a rude \"I can't do that\" and handed me a soda cup. I decided not to argue any further so ended up paying about 3$ extra for a soda. Won't go back again, the tacos are not worth the horrible service."}
{"text":"My family from California always want to stop by Chronic Tacos when they're in town as they're a hit back home in the seaside towns. It's always been fresh, the staff at this location are always very friendly and helpful, and they serve pick-it-yourself type meals, which are very accommodating to everyone in the group. Now, if you're looking for the deeply marinated, well-seasoned fatty authentic Mexican food you will not find it here. This is more geared towards the healthy crowd and as such, they are much more similar to Chipotle than they are any -Bertos.. As long as you know what you are going to get, I think you'll find their food to be quite good! If you're looking for something more authentic, go down the road a little bit more towards 19th and Peoria and hit up Taco Mich who sells some of the most savory, rich Mexican food I've had in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This is a solid option for a quick lunch or late night snack.  I ordered two potato tacos and an order of Chronic Fries.  You get to choose your toppings for whatever you order which is nice.  There are a decent number of options.

The tacos were good.  The flavor was good and the portion size was ok.  The fries are a huge portion.  They are best shared by several people or multiple meals for one person.  The fries are good, and they do not skimp with the toppings.

The staff was decent and I got my food fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Over priced food!  Have gone several times and have experienced long waits each time; and the assemblers of the food put lime on my food twice after I said no. I also got corn instead of flour tortillas. Too many mistakes for a four dollar taco. The allowing of writing is insulting, writing by hundreds of teenagers with bad language and inappropriate content. Go to Los Tacos on Sahara and VV. Much bigger tacos, better prices and better taste."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I loved getting fries as the base and making a burrito bowl out of it (it had rice, reads, cheese, chicken, and guac!!) only thing i wish is if they had more salsa options, it was a little dry. but non the less delicious! It was set up like a chipotle/subway choose your item and select your meats/toppings"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when I came here ...maybe this would taste like Rubios? I think the fish tacos are much better here then Rubio's but the Shrimp taco impressed me the most ! I was expecting it to be made of popcorn shrimp but they were good sized shrimps for the money you pay. My husband had the Carne Asada burrito he said it was better then Robertos....I was like, \"Are you sure\"? The reason I questioned him on that is because Roberto's is our \"go to place\"  for So Cal comfort food . He said that he liked that their burrito didn't have a lot of meat fat (he hates meat fat) and it just overall tasted better. If you don't like beans or rice in your burrito make sure you tell them you want it on the side. We also ordered the guacamole and chips which I wasn't a fan of. I don't think they give you a lot of Guacamole compared to how many chips and it wasn't spicy enough for me. I liked their drink selection which had sodas, teas and Orange Whip ... it's like an Orange Julius. I was happy with the food and I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"They are never consistent with their food. I would be sure this is directly attributed to their high turnover rate."}
{"text":"The marinated pork is really good. Everything else is kinda meh."}
{"text":"I'd heard pretty mixed things about it from people I know, but the reviews on here are positive for the most part. I went there last week and found the food to be just OK. I got the beer-battered fish taco and and a carne asada taco. The fish taco had a good-sized piece of fish on it, but it really had no flavor. It was pretty much a giant fish stick on a tortilla. I'm not even a huge fan of fish, but this seriously had no fish flavor to it at all. The carne asada seemed a bit more like big chunks of ground beef sitting in juice. The flavor was good, but not really what I've come to expect from carne asada. The tortillas were good and the toppings and sauce on the tacos had a nice taste. 

The last part I took issue with were the chips: All I could smell when they were anywhere near my face was the grease that they were fried in. I like fried foods as much as the next person, but the oil smell was so overpowering I couldn't eat more than a few chips.

The best part of this place - and what sets it apart from any other place I've ever been - is that they have Gringo Bandito hot sauce on the tables. If you don't know what that is and you like hot sauce, you really need to check it out. It's such a flavorful sauce and goes well on pretty much anything. Well done, Chronic Taco staff, for having great taste in hot sauce.

I might come back to try some more things if I'm in the area or some friends want to check it out, but I don't think I'll be making a special trip by myself."}
{"text":"Went there in March 2016; just getting around to write this review. One word: amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego, CA, so I pretty much grew up with Mexican food. Taco shops were ubiquitous in my 'hood. Taco Bell and Tex-Mex? Flour tortillas and ground beef? No thank you, sir. So Chronic Taco reminds me of those taco shops that weren't that good, but you went because you were desperate and broke. And they always left you with belly full of grease. That's what Chronic reminds me of. 

Behind the faux-cool interior decor that includes graffiti tagged walls, Chronic cannot serve decent food consistently. I work nearby, so I know what's up. I think. At times, the food is good. But the next day can be downright gross. Their chicken tacos left me nauseated. I like their vegetarian and potato taco the best. The potato taco is probably the most interesting item in my opinion, it's like a mashed potato taco that is deep fried. Blasphemy right? It's actually tasty (in moderation, of course!) . But their veggie and potato tacos aren't good enough to visit every week. Next time, I'm sticking to Los Tacos."}
{"text":"First time trying this place via Uber eats. Sadly the food was pretty cold when it got to us. I ordered a shrimp bowl and added fajita veggies, I wouldn't say the veggies were worth the additional price because they were a bit scarce. Decent chips and salsa. My husband ordered a pollo asada taco and carne asada fries. The fries actually didn't come with any meat and were like $12, which is crazy for fries. He reached our via Uber eats and received an immediate refund, which was awesome. I enjoyed my meal enough to try this place again. Would rate them a four if the fries came as ordered."}
{"text":"Love me some Chronic, but walking into the restaurant tonight at 7:14pm and seeing all the chairs stacked as if they were closed and then waiting in line to find that they were out of rice and some of the meats was a sorry excuse for a reaturant.  Nothing like getting that welcome feeling when entering a restaurant as if they wish they were already closed. The three of us walked out, and were joined by more customers behind us.  We all ended up at Sammy's Woodfired Pizza.  Nothing like wanting tacos and getting pizza.  Thank you Chronic Pizza for nothing...."}
{"text":"I had been anticipating coming since I saw it being built. Sounded good and I had never tried it. It was my 4th attempt to go there because the past few times I either showed up or called they were closed (even though it was still open time). Their reason was that it was too slow so they closed up early. 

Anyway, finally went and ordered 3 tacos  (they have 3 tacos for $8.49 otherwise they're  $4 each), a burrito (also $8.49 but it's a dollar off on Mondays), and made it a combo which added Tortilla chips and a drink for an additional $3 or so. 

First off, the tortillas were kinda cold, mushy, and flabby even after they had just warmed them. Got two carne asada and one pollo taco. The chicken and meat in the taco were also cold (who knows how long they'd been sitting) and practically had no flavor at all. The burrito was absolutely flavorless.. I couldn't make sense of it -- it had white rice, black beans, carne asada, lettuce, pico de gallo, and cheese in it. It was so disappointing and bland. The rice was mushy and we had to add lime to the burrito to taste a bit of anything. The chips were extremely boring and cheap, and guac... do I even need to say it was flavorless?  Practically, everything was. As slow as it was (no customers were coming in or ordering) the employees still left the already cold meat and chicken sitting out uncovered.

Unfortunately, the entire meal was a disappointment. I will never go back and I consider it a waste of $20. I wouldn't be surprised if they closed down."}
{"text":"Such an awesome spot! Fresh and healthy food and delicious frozen margaritas. Baja fish tacos are my favorite but the bowls are awesome value for money. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was craving for some Mexican food so I stopped here, because I heard it had just opened up. The first thing I noticed was how nice this place looked the lighting and the walls look awesome. The menu has quite a variety, I decided to go with a carne asada burrito, this place is place is kind of similar to Chipotle in that you can choose what  ingredients you want on the fly. 

Let me tell you, they hooked my burrito up! It was packed with carne asada, rice, beans, and salsa. I'd probably say it was 3 lbs! Great food great price. Would be 5 stars but the staff wasn't too chipper. Otherwise cool place. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix on business and had a hankering for some good, quick Mexican food .. Decided to give Chronic Tacos a shot and it is the absolute best Mexican food I've ever had. I had two chicken tacos and an al pastor taco with Baja sauce on all three... Baja sauce is a gift from heaven. Their chips are made fresh in the store and their salsa is on point. I will be back every time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The carnitas burrito I had was on par with some of the best I have had in various states including Cali and New York. Can't speak to the rest of the menu, but the carnitas with the Baja sauce and spicy salsa was on point."}
{"text":"A chipotle type place that the only decent thing on the menu is there easily made potato taco. A taco place should have some of its culture there but It didn't.. The food was as bland as the employees. Much better suited place is mucho macho taco which blows this place out of the water. If you eat here only get a potato taco, and try the ghost pepper hot sauce."}
{"text":"Chicken taco was good, steak taco could've been a lot better. The meat was kinda dry, cold, and rough. Normally I'm not a huge fan of chicken tacos, so I'm surprised that I liked them better than the carne asada. The coke machine squirted me. Yes, literally. I pressed the button for regular lemonade, and the machine squirted orange soda on my white shirt. That was annoying. For being called \"Chronic\" tacos, they weren't really that dope. Despite all this, I think the manager saw that the machine squirted me, and he gave me and my daughter free cinnamon twists. That was nice ! All in all, I'm not super impressed though. Would I come back? If I was forced to lol, but not of my own free will because there is a myriad of better tacos in Phoenix


***BONUS-- super nice manager saw my review and gave me a free t shirt ! Yayy."}
{"text":"This new Mexican restaurant tries to copy the same concept as Chipotle and Cafe Rio. You have a few options to select from, salad, burrito, shrimp taco, nachos, torta and bowl burrito. From there you can select your protein, chicken, carnitas, adobada, fish, shrimp or steak. You can select all of the topics you would like but they are somewhat limited. Some of the options available were pico de gallo, lettuce, cheese, veggies and guacamole for extra charge. I ordered carne asada, but they had run out of it and it was not ready by the time I ordered. It was disappointing to see they were not on top of their game. The prices were very reasonable. I also liked the fact that there is a bar available, however, it was empty when I visited the location. Overall, the food was very average. I doubt I would crave a meal here, but it was good for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place. A bit of SoCal in LV. Tacos and Burritos are awesome. My Buddy had the Flautas and said that they were some of the best he ever had. Best food court stop I can ever remember. They even have Dos Equis!"}
{"text":"I just finished eating there a few minutes ago, and I cannot say I was impressed at all with their food. I had 2 carne asada \"fatty\" tacos, and a coke...The carne asada was bland and tasteless, as were the other ingredients...Their \"hot\" sauce was a joke...2  \"fatty\" tacos and a coke set me back almost $8.50, and I still left there hungry....Sorry boys, but Roberto's beats the pants off of you...."}
{"text":"I love me some \"bowls\" whether it be at Chipolte or El Pollo or here. Can't really mess that up. beans, rice, meat, cheese and fresh ingredients. They happen to have a Baja sauce that keeps me coming back here more often than the others.

My only quibble is they have a real hard time understanding that if I ask for extra whatever, and they say it'll be more $$... I say fine load it up and charge me. They barely give me extra. Some kind of corporate costs control thing, I'm guessing."}
{"text":"Soooo stoked that they brought a chronic taco back to Vegas!!!! Its inexpensive and food is very good. I absolutely love their tacos. I usually order two al pastor tacos and they always have plenty of meat and then I do the \"make it a combo\" which comes with chips, salsa and a drink! They also have a bar that is pretty decent size. They have a special on taco Tuesday where you get $1 of each taco."}
{"text":"Omg do not eat here massively  overpriced. $7 for A burrito with 2oz of meat .rip off bad deal avoid"}
{"text":"How much salt do you need to put on the freaking carne asada?  Seriously, I hope you guys are using a recipe and not eyeballing it. The deep fried fish taco was good. Would have been netter if it was in a corn tortilla like I asked for. My server seemed a lot too confused.  I may go back at some point.  Also, I'm not thrilled about paying $13 for 3 tacos and a drink. The equivalent at Roberto's is like $9."}
{"text":"I don't write a ton of reviews, but my husband and I just had such a bad experience I had to write a review. I ordered a veggie breakfast burrito with refried beans and The site forced me to order guacamole, which I didn't want, but I got it anyhow or it wouldn't let me order the burrito. The veggie breakfast burrito is supposed to have potatoes in it, it came without potatoes. It also came made layered of guacamole, eggs, and then refried beans so that every bite I took was just one ingredient. I had to open the burrito up and mix it up so it didn't suck so bad. I was so bummed, and so annoyed. My husband ordered the carne asada nachos, and they were also a complete bummer. They had just a little cheese and meat sprinkled over the top. Nothing else. The chips underneath were completely bare and kinda stale too. Overall a complete disappointment on all accounts."}
{"text":"I have came here for a month straight and tried using my REWARD points and every time they keep saying I can't use them or next time! Don't set a damn reward system if you can't honor it! Won't be coming back here again! You can have your damn $10!!"}
{"text":"First time customers and we were not disappointed. I had the Carne Asada Chronic Fries and my Husband had the Carne Asada Burrito. Food was delicious and the service was great. Can't wait to hit up a Chronic Tacos in SoCal."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, it's near my new office. I'll try it again but this visit was kind of \"meehhh\". The staff seemed super overwhelmed, they had several people in line, online orders coming in and sounded like certain food was not ready to be served. They sell a bottle of hot sauce but don't offer any at the tables or anywhere in the restaurant- call me crazy but I like hot sauce for my Mexican food. 

Had a small burrito, it was okay. I'll come back for a bowl sometime but first impression was not a wow. Bummer"}
{"text":"Came in at 8pm on 1/18/18 and long lines and help were slow....total disappointment.  Normally during the day, they're on top of their game. May not ever come back..."}
{"text":"After reviewing the menu, my friend and I decided to share a trio of Tacos w/ Carnitas (Slow-Cooked Pork), Al Pastor (Spicy Adoba Pork), and Carne Asada (Marinated Grilled Steak). We loaded them up with onion, pico de gallo, black beans, lettuce, cilantro, and fresh limes on the side. Guacamole is included with tacos, but if you can believe it, they forgot. Fortunately, we were dining in and I remembered after we sat down, so I was given a side of guacamole to compensate. Anyway, the tacos were just okay. The flavors of all the proteins just seemed a little off and none of the options were entirely appetizing. However, we also tried the Chronic Fries w/ Pollo Asado (Marinated Grilled Chicken) and enjoyed it. This is their version of loaded fries or more familiarly, \"Carne Asada Fries\" (though for this dish, only Carne Asada is extra $). The fries held up well and the toppings were good as the chicken tasted much better than our other protein options. Though I was not impressed with the tacos and subsequently not expecting much from their other menu selections, the Chronic Fries were good enough that if I had a hankering for loaded fries, I would consider a trip back for them."}
{"text":"Love the chronic fries! The meat is so delicious here I literally have a hard time picking what I want every time I come"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I'd say this is better than chipotle, same type of food and concept. Wish they had more locations! And a little more staff so the like moves faster, but that's no biggie cause it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Had the pastor burrito and it really wasn't that great. Probably wouldn't come back. The meat was ok and the size was ok. Not the best I've had."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the carne asada most times I have been here. The problem is it's not consistent with the best taste I have had on probably on two occasions of the ten times I have been here. The service is good and kids meals could be a little bigger. The condiments are all fresh and colorful. Definitely recommend and hopefully you will get the asada when it's on point"}
{"text":"I do not suggest you go here. Today I went, wanting chicken tacos, and then being told that it would be about 20 minutes on the chicken. So I decided to go with something  easier, I got breakfast burrito. And I had to wait 15 minutes for that. Why? It's just a couple of eggs you had to make! My best friend that I had gone with, was nearly done with eating her dinner, when they just began making mine.  When I asked what took so long, I was told, \"you're getting your order cooked fresh ma'am\". 
I have had fresh cooked food and a lot faster time than this. I could've went home make eggs myself, and make the tortillas myself faster. The service was absolutely horrible, and the attitude of the workers, was not any better. Burrito, not nearly worth waiting 15 minutes for, nor paying for at all. I could've gone to any other restaurant, and gotten in my entire meal before it took them to make my burrito..I only gave this place one star, because that's the lowest you can give."}
{"text":"Positives:  Salsa (tomatoes/cilantro) is very good; extremely quick service and food was done; restaurant is clean; lots of seats and espn on t.v.

Negatives: Salty carne asada meat; dry spanish rice

I will try it again and get something different"}
{"text":"Zero stars if I could. The absolute worst. I'm surprised the people that work here haven't drowned in the shower like a turkey in the rain. Tried to order a salad with chicken got beef. They were out of rice. Remade my salad with chicken but left off the black beans. Had to repeat multiple times what you wanted and still the kid behind the counter couldn't get it right or comprehend what you're saying. After all of that the food is just ok, I can get the same thing at Chipotle for a lot less.
Oh, and if you order a salad they don't have any salad dressings, wouldn't have ordered a salad if I had known that."}
{"text":"6 people in front of me tonight to get food.  I walked in at 645 and left at 720.  Seemed really slow and really unorganized. Food was ok.  It was a taco.  May give another shot, but right now,,just another average taco joint."}
{"text":"They dont have cups for water.. What kind of restaurant serves food but doesnt give cups for water? Smh"}
{"text":"Busy Busy for lunch line moves fast workers a little disorganized but the KICKER no guacamole at 12:30 on a Friday.....unacceptable!"}
{"text":"We love the tacos but we are not in love with the prices. This was $23 worth. I think they really need to reevaluate their pricing per taco."}
{"text":"We were the only ones in line. 
Took the guy 6 minutes to stop what he's doing and start taking our order. Then waited another 7 or 8 minutes for fajita veggies to be made. Last salad was fish..so we waited maybe 9 minutes for the fish. While waiting, he had to throw away the first salad and make a new one. Lettuce was wilted. Then he says fajita veggies were out. When it was finally time to pay, that took forever too. I'm never going back again."}
{"text":"I am disappointed in this place. I had several co workers and friends talk this place up so I decided to give it a try. I ordered a small burrito and the employee making it seemed confused on how to make a burrito. By the time he was done preparing it he couldn't get it to roll into a burrito. Then when he finally got it rolled up the tortilla was cracked all over and it fell apart as I was eating it. I also ordered a side of chips and guacamole. The guac was great but for the price I didn't get very much and ran out of chips before I was close to finishing the dip. Not worth my money at all."}
{"text":"Located inside of Palms Casino food court. First bite of a carne asada burrito was salt! After the initial shock of that, the other ingredients came through; rice, cheese, refried beans, cilantro and salsa. Together this weighed at least two pounds. Similar to Chipolte.
Not bad, but my next visit will be for their namesake tacos at the Summerlin store."}
{"text":"The location is okay. It's very clean and the restaurant setup is great. The food is where they'll lose you. It's good Mexican food. If you're looking for authentic Mexican taste then this isn't the place. The portions are great, but there's just something missing with the taste."}
{"text":"Pretty average. My Al pastor pork were chewy nuggets not shredded pork. Decent chips. All around would not make a special trip to go there."}
{"text":"Tacos looked as sad as the people working there. $5 per taco and they still looked and tasted thrown together and bland. Won't visit again."}
{"text":"Went on Taco Tuesday. Had carne asada tacos. Excellent for the price and included guac. Def will be back! Friendly service, clean restaurant, and pleasant first-time experience! 

Nice location if the person you're with would rather eat something else! 

Concept is similar to Chipotle with better veggie options and smaller portion options! Check it out!

Limited seating."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Friday night - there were several people working but still took quite a long time to get through the line and get our food. Several of them didn't appear to know what was going on or were new and not properly trained. The process of ordering was also a bit weird - set up \"chipotle\" style but some food has to come from the kitchen so then your good is farther back in the line making it hard to add the \"toppings\". 

Also found the food to be mediocre and expensive - had carne asada burrito and 2 tacos - shrimp and fish - both combos with chips and a drink and was about $30. The burrito was \"fine\" but prefer chipotle - pretty much the same. Tacos were okay - tortillas were cold, shrimp sauce was really spicy (without warning) and toppings were meh (would prefer tacos at rubios to these). Overall fairly disappointing - will not return."}
{"text":"I had the chronic nachos and they where DELICIOUS! They where busy as I came in but they still greeted me awesome job on that. I did eat inside but they have the patio connected to the inside and it felt nice having the fresh air. One of my favorite place to come."}
{"text":"$8.00 for a burrito? Then I had to pay more to add guacamole. Chips and salsa more $$$?  At least when I saw how big the burrito was I thought it might be ok. Then as I start eating it I realize it's literally 50% rice. Only about 4 ounces of meat. What a rip off. 
  If it was at least good I might of thought it was acceptable. It wasn't. No flavor at all. Taco Bell would be 1/4 the price and much better. This place is way over priced and not good at all. Stay away."}
{"text":"This location needs to get their s__t together or change the name to chaos tacos. 

The nearby Chipotle must be happy to hear this kind of review."}
{"text":"I'm here now and it's freaking delicious the place is slammed but worth the wait extremely fresh..."}
{"text":"First time at this place, and most likely the last time. I was really looking forward to this place. I love mexican food. Tacos, burritos, chips and salsa, you name it ill buy it. But this was a let down. This is similar to Chiplote as picking a bowl and burrito with choice of meat and toppings. 
I ordered the small burrito with Al pastor. Now I love Al pastor, big fan. But this Al pastor tasted watery? It had a very watered down and weird after taste. It left a film coating in my mouth which I didnt like. The refried beans and spanish rice was just alright. I feel I could cook some at home that tasted better. Pico was really good. 
I also ordered the potato taco. This was the best part out of my whole meal. Just mashed potatos deep fried in a tortilla. If I came back it'd be just for those. Other than that I'd pass it up for Chiplote which I dont really care for either but I know there will be flavor there.
The service was really good. Very friendly and helpful when picking what to order. They werent busy when we had walked in, but everything seemed clean with a lot of decent space to sit and move around."}
{"text":"My son wanted to go to Chipotle, but I wanted to try the new Chronic Taco in our neighborhood. I ordered a fish taco without any chipotle sauce because my stomach can't handle spicy food or sauces. Unfortunately, I noticed there was sauce on the taco when I picked our order up from the counter. I asked politely if they could make another taco without sauce, but I was informed that the sauce isn't that hot, but they would make me a new taco if I really wanted them to.  After taking a small bite I realized the sauce was spicy just like anything that is made with chipotle usually is. I was really hungry but I didn't ask for a new taco because my 14 year old son and I were the only customers in the restaurant and I felt bad. I ended up giving my taco to my son since I knew I couldn't eat it. I wish I could say this experience hasn't affected my willingness to return, but it definitely has."}
{"text":"I was there a couple days ago. When I went in there where only 2 other people there. There where 4 employees working. I ordered and went to pay. The counter was filthy. I ask the person why and no response. I was waiting for my order and looked around the condiment counter was also filthy. There where several tables that where dirty. When my order was up they started to ask me what I wanted on it. Again saw how dirty the area where they were serving from. They could care less about the customer . I  will never go back and will tell others not to go either. There,seemed to be no manager there or if there was one they need to be fired."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Chronic Tacos before and wanted to try it out. The food was really good, and portions are hefty. The gentlemen that seemed to be of managerial status was very friendly, and provided excellent customer service. He came over to our table to see how our food was, and said \"thank you\" as we were leaving. We will be going back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I drive all the way from Tempe to eat here and have never been disappointed. The staff is fun and friendly, and the food is fresh and delicious. This stuff's way better than chipotle! Do yourself a favor and stop by and try it for yourself. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty good, friendly staff.
Kind of cool setting with a small bar area.  Only let down was the similar concept of most of the other make to order \"taco/bowl/burrito\" places; but the taste was good."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff! I highly recommend the nachos and they don't charge extra for guac! Go here before all the other restaurants in the food court."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. The employees were very short and a bit rude. The food was so cold that the cheese didn't even melt. It was a pretty pricey meal for food that was less than satisfying. I think you are bette off spending your money at Cafe Rio. The ambiance at chronic tacos was very cool but that does not make up for the lack of good tasting food."}
{"text":"OK...so I've read the reviews, complaints, and compliments given to Chronic Taco, and - based on my experience today - would have to say that hands down, Chronic Taco has its competitors beat.

Not only was the staff friendly, they were quite helpful when - as a new patron of their establishment - it came to me placing my order, answering all of my questions, and recommending particular favorites they have tried.

The portions were quite generous, and, despite previous reports to the contrary, were heated accordingly.

While similar in nature to its competitor's menu, Chronic Taco's flavor choices were right on the mark - savory, and full of favorable spices and herbs. There was enough heat in the food combination to provide excellent flavors, yet it strayed from being offensive to the pallet. 

If you're looking for something quick that will satisfy your appetite, I highly recommend trying this restaurant. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just got takeout. Great potato tacos is the good news. Bad news is that they basically have one champion in the kitchen who's running_the_place (give that kid* a raise, manager; he's the only thing keeping this place above water) and everything else is disarray and confusion and mayhem. Good kids running the place though; they're just unnecessarily frustrated, presumably at the lack of organization and leadership

*I'd love to credit him, but no one wears name tags and when I asked someone for his name she didn't know"}
{"text":"Was not impressed.  Food was a little pricey compared to restaurant fare.  Let's be honest there are a lot of Arizona taco/burrito joints.  One fish taco was 4.29 and over marinated (dripping in the sauce).  The carne asada taco was 3.79 and very gristly.  The baja sauce was good but it overpowered the flavor of the carne asada (probably not the best fit for steak).  It went better with the fish but i couldn't taste the fish anyways due to the over-done marinade.  For a fast food taco place i would say better than taco bell... but not by a lot.  Try another local AZ non-chain.  The workers rushed us with our order (busy Tuesday night so I understand but at the prices they charge service is nowhere close to being on par with it).  May be back but not likely."}
{"text":"I think thjs location is either shut down or about to shut down. Its been closed lately. If its shut down that bullsh1t... i give them 5 stars cuz taco life ese!"}
{"text":"Located inside the food court of the Palms Hotel & Casino. Chronic Tacos opened their 2nd location in Las Vegas this past Monday. Never having tried Chronic, I decided to give it a go since it's nearby.
The spot looked nice enough. Prices reasonable. I got the burrito with Al Pastor, and made it a meal. The meal included chips, salsa, rice, beans & a drink. Came out to $10 which isn't too bad. They had no trays available since I was dining in, so I had to carry 4 separate things to a table.
The burrito(pun intended) was a fatty! It was almost as wide as it was long. It's what I would imagine I'd look like if I was a burrito. The meal sides of spanish rice & pinto beans were decent tasting. The burrito alone probably would have sufficed. I only finished about half of the meal and had to take the rest home. I asked the lady at the Chronic register if I could get a plastic bag to carry my stuff home and she said they had none. Odd.
Except for no trays or plastic takeout bags it was good. I will have to go back and give a few of the other options a try. They had a good selection of meats/seafood to choose from. Steak, chicken, fish, shrimp and even veggie, to name a few."}
{"text":"Food was good... so I heard from the rest of my family... I ordered just guac and chips and I didn't get mine.  Said they would refund my credit card but didn't ask for my card number and said they would take care of it... as suspected never got the refund or my guacamole.  That's the only reason for the 3 stars..."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Especially ... I think her name was Amari. Or something like that. Maybe Mari. Anyway, she was so nice and helpful. We brought our kids in and she was so thoughtful and took a second out of her day to acknowledge them. Great asset to this company! The food was great. No disappointments.  I will definitely be coming again. I've also referred my friends here."}
{"text":"I was honestly comparing it to chipotle the whole time and decided that this place is much more bang for your buck! First off you guac is included!!! And their beer-batter shrimp tacos were absolutely no disappointment. The hot sauce is actually hot and they have some great ghost pepper sauce If you wanna throw some on top."}
{"text":"Hummmm, we took a drive from the Silverado area, to go there, because of our Groupon that we got. Well, it was OK, not worth driving over there again for. If your in the area, and don't want to spend alot of money, this might be the place for you. 
It's not like taco bell, so just something different. 
Yes we noticed it was geared towards teens and young adults. Not that that bothered me. 
I got the Enchiladas, and the fish taco, baja style, it was OK, my husband got the Carna Estada Tacos, he said it was OK. 
They said they make there own Salsa everyday, the chips actually tasted better without the salsa. 
I just say, don't go out of your way to go here, if your in the area......Then check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"The Fish Burrito is HUGE  and very good....almost TOO Big!.....warning this is fried  fish so extra gym time might be required later.  All the team who works there are very friendly and helpful.   Good spot for lunch when in Summerlin."}
{"text":"The first time I tried to go, there was a power outage and the restaurant couldn't serve. Ok, not their problem, I'll try again. The next time I went with my SO, and it was a comedy of errors. We each ordered two tacos, each ordered one fried fish taco. One taco came out grilled so we sent it back. The next time it came out, it was fried shrimp on flour (had requested corn). We each ordered a drink. We were given one cup. We reached ordered baja style on the tacos. Two came out baja, one had to be sent back down the line, one we just ate.The food itself was okay. I like that you can have a variety of presentation choices, not just a burrito or a bowl. I like that the ingredients seem fresh. The al pastor was nicely seasoned and just a hint of spicy. The line/ staff? They were overwhelmed and seemed confused. It was not particularly busy the day we were there, but you could tell there was dis-coordination. Also, maybe cut the music a bit so the workers don't have to keep asking you to repeat what you said? I will probably give it another shot but I'm quite happy at El Pollo Loco across the street... although they did forget my chipotle sauce recently, haha."}
{"text":"Surprisingly the food was great, and staff was extremely friendly despite it being a busy Friday night"}
{"text":"Located inside the Palms Hotel, this restaurant looks cool on the outside.  But, inside, the burrito's are as cold as the service you will receive. I highly recommend not eating at Chronic."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the salad bowl with carnitas. It was generous and filling. Service was slow but there was a conference that let out, so a lot of people."}
{"text":"Taste/price/no soda.. I'd pass, there's a place next door better. Chronic tacos is to chipotle but with tacos. The place just opened at 10 AM and the meat in my chicken and steak taco is cold. The flavor and price are ok but there's more exciting places right here. I'm throwing away one of my tacos and I bought a soda they were out of every kind I drink in the machine. I was given a bottle of coke and its expired, so it's flat. It was a waste of gas driving up here there is a  Taco Bell right next to my school. Lunch no Bueno today"}
{"text":"I love this new location! Chronic is like Chipotle, but a little more authentic. I've always loved Chronic Taco & while in AZ- I took my sister to get our fix. My favorite is a shrimp burrito. Everything always tastes fresh & I love the guacamole! The store is clean and the service is quick! What else could you want!?"}
{"text":"Drive by this place everyday for work and was craving tacos tonight so I gave it a try. Placed my order online and went in at my pickup time. Place is nicely decorated and clean. Larger than expected. Knew right away I made a mistake when I walked in and there was only one other person there on a Friday night at 6p. Didn't have my order ready and didn't even start it till I arrived.  Live 3 min away and when I got home the meat in the pork taco was cold. Food was very difficult to swallow and barely made it through a taco. Ordered churros too... how do you mess up a churro? Wouldn't eat here again nor would I recommend to others."}
{"text":"It is open as of 04-11-18
I was hungry and wanted something filling,  but I didn't want to hit the buffet. This was perfect!  Food, very good, fresh, made to order. Facility/staff, very clean, very helpful. It is noisy in the food court, and the staff didn't have an attitude with repeating themselves or me needing to.
I had a bowl-ritto, with chicken, pinto beans and just about everything else. It was a lot of food, and hit the spot"}
{"text":"I'm hopeful today was just a bad for the staff... they sure made it uncomfortable for all of the people that were in line with us just now. There was a real sense that we were all inconveniencing them. We started in the line with a lady that was clearly irritated with her coworkers... there was a lot of her shaking her head and rolling her eyes at the guy working the toppings next to her. The station he was working was a disaster and for good reason. Whenever he grabbed something to put on your items he was cross contaminating everything! If you wanted guac (you have to ask for it even though it comes with the tacos) you were also getting salsa, cheese and whatever else had been drug across it. The counter was disgusting!!! Even after there was nobody in line their first priority was restocking lids for to go containers and not wiping down the filthy workstation. 

This was our first impression of the place and frankly they just weren't working together. Chances are we won't be back.

**Worth noting** the food itself was pretty tasty. If the service was more together this place would be pretty hard to beat. Especially considering the Taco Tuesday deal.

It also speaks volumes that the owner reached out within five minutes of my review to let me know he took my comments to heart and will try and improve his establishment."}
{"text":"Damn good tacos that really hit the spot. The al pastor meat was perfection. All the veggie toppings and hot sauces were so fresh. Only complaint is that the flour tortilla was a bit on the dry side.

Came here on xmas eve and the staff was super friendly with their cute Santa hats."}
{"text":"Such good food and amazing service. Owner and owners father introduced us and made us feel welcomed all the time. will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was at a conference near here and needed some tacos. This place was all that I wanted and more. Cause they had beer too! Excellent choice if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Waited 3 months for this place to open so when it finally did I rushed in! How disappointing. I ordered 1 lg chips and salsa, 2 steak tacos, and 1 reg drink. How do you average almost $13.00 for that? The tacos were the size of your palm, literally. There was almost nothing on them. I guess that's why they make it with two tortillas to make up for the lack of food you pay for. The manager looked like she was intimidating the girl making my food so she was scared to put anything on it. Not worth $3.25 + tax a piece. The chips were good but mind you it was a large. They gave me a 4 oz salsa cup filled up to 2 oz. To top off the whole visit the manager had her kids there working. There was a little boy, had to be no older than 8-9, come out from the kitchen to the front. No hairnet but was wearing gloves? As a 10 1/2 year culinary chef I know that this is obviously unsanitary and illegal. I wonder if the owner is aware of what is going on over there? I've heard many people talk about this place and every one of them has said that they're not going back. I felt like I got ripped off to make up for building costs' of the place. What a joke."}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but it reminds me of Chipotle. Though this place has a better twist on their menu, best example Chronic Fries! If it's your first time, don't forget to order themm fries #drooling 

The only thing I would complain about, is that it isn't the best seating arrangement for high chairs/little ones if it's busy."}
{"text":"I was in Arizona on a business meeting and my coworker recommended I try Chronic Tacos as he frequents the place regularly for his lunch. His recommendation did not disappoint. I ordered the carne asada small burrito and was quite impressed by how flavorful the burrito was. Carne asada is a common ingredient, but few establishments accomplish the tenderness of the meat and flavor of the sauces as well as this place does. I tried a bit of my coworkers fish tacos as well, and I think that it's also a solid option! Pricing seems like a worthy deal to me, considering how hard it is for Arizona to get legitimate seafood!"}
{"text":"I can't understand why this place only has 3 stars! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Palms for Viva Las Vegas 19 and we were worried we could not find a restaurant that was vegetarian friendly. After walking around the Palms we saw Chronic Tacos and decided to give it a try. We both ordered the Vegetarian Bowl-rito and it was delicious! This place is comparable to Chipotle because they both have the same \"choose your add-ins\" style. The sauteed veggies were perfect and you get way more food than expected!! It's located in the Palms Hotel food court area where there is a lot of seating. They also offer breakfast options for those who actually wake up early during their Vegas vacation."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good spot to grab some tacos and burritos.   Great location inside the Palms casino resort.  They have nice employees that make good Mexican food.  

Also offer beer"}
{"text":"Came in on opening day, but after the rush cleared 3pm ish. The tacos were good. Tried the fish Baja style and the chicken tacos with Spanish rice and black beans. Not bad. The service was great. Gonna have to come back and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Food quality is 3.5- a bit on the saltier side
Selection-3
Customer service 1-told the guy my order three times and that it was to-go and he still made it for dine in

Overall reminds me of a chipotle concept. Nothing to go outta your way for. Maybe I'll give them another chance on a different day with different staff?"}
{"text":"It seems not too busy,and my steak burrito, was pretty dry, I guess it need a little guacamole or something , which was extra,,the burrito it self, was pricey than at a good taqueria, it was salty and just ok,,, would of better off getting tacos maybe? Service was prompt and friendly, funny they offer white rice if you did not want Spanish rice? No thx I was probably better off get a sandwich at Earl, will not be going back to chronics..."}
{"text":"I so much wanted to like this place because we live close by and have small children in the family, so finding a good place with fresh food is sometimes difficult.  Chronic has good food, but the service is very bad. With a largish family it takes about 45 minutes to get your food. Everyone's food comes out at different times, and not once did we get our whole order. After 3 visits we have given up. The temperature inside the store is also freezing. Not good for small toddlers and an infant. Had to take the kids outside to warm up during long disorganized waits."}
{"text":"So much better than Chipotle! The quality and the taste of the food is fantastic. Chipotle is so bland and doesn't even compare to this. It's about time one opened up in AZ. I'm obsessed with the Carne Asada Quesadilla. SO good!"}
{"text":"I think the 3 star rating on this one is correct. It's not that the food is bad, it's ok. But other factors like snotty crew, slow service, etc. make this joint just another taco place. You can't compare this to \"Chip..le\" that's got it beat hands down!"}
{"text":"First time here and service wasn't very friendly. It was fairly unsettling because they weren't busy either."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've been here. Its a cool name with a good atmosphere but the food is below average and I will not be back. The tortillas look they they are the cheap ones you get at Fry's for $3 for 2 dozen. The carne asada had big chewy pieces of fat. The pollo asado was salty and not fresh tasting. The staff was ok. I should have went to Yogi's Grill instead. :-("}
{"text":"I didn't think the food was anything special or above and beyond. I feel like it was a burrito in a bowl. The wait in line was around 20 minutes. Kinda long wait for an assembly line food place. On that note Ill give them the benefit of the doubt, it was 6:30 on taco Tuesday and their new location. So it was busy. The glass food guard is pretty tall. Maybe I'm just short? But it caused issues with the food prep. There was a lot of \"what?\" \"Did you want guac?\" \"Oh ok sure\" yea it's a decent place but nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"the carne asada is so good we deal with the shit show of employees stumbling over eachother to get it at least once a week. the place def needs a suggestion box, menu is confusing, again employees are just funny how all over the place they are, the manager, haha we laugh at her every time because she's always storming around not helping. good thing the food is so bomb, also careful if you're on your lunch, 2 taco stations one register never seems to pan out in our favor ."}
{"text":"Chewie meat and hard as well. The sauce was not even average...
no thanks-never again"}
{"text":"Drive all the way over here and they close at 9pm! Change your hours on YELP! So stupid to provide false info!"}
{"text":"Ok this is going to be my last update for Chronic Taco.

I really want to love this place.
I went back again yesterday before a movie, and decided to try the chicken tacos. 

Not only were they greasy, fatty, and tasteless, but I also found a chicken bone in my taco.  

If you go here, get the shrimp burrito (the deal with the free chips and salsa) or the potato taco, but I don't know how much else I'd eat here...

Very sad."}
{"text":"As others mentioned - it's like Subway or Chipotle. The food is a bit on the pricey side (maybe that's related to the new minimum wage law?) and it just didn't blow us away. It's not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to grab some of their Al Pastor - but at least they HAVE Al Pastor, while others usually just have carnitas. 

They DO have a ghost pepper hot sauce that's pretty good, and u can buy it for $5 a bottle, which is probably the best value in the joint. If you buy any \"specialty\" hot sauces - you'll know that is a decent deal! 

We'll try it again on a Tuesday when the tacos are a bit more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Gluten-free carnitas are great, much better than the \"other\" place I normally buy them. Too bad we don't have Chronic in Anthem/Carefree/Norterra!"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE chronic tacos! The food is always fresh, the salsas are flavorful, i love the Baja sauce  and the meat has so much more flavor than Chipotle! I always go with the bowl, and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"this place sucked!! we heard about it so decided to check it out. the food SUCKED!! and the service SUCKED!!  
we walked in and no one was in line and there were 5 people behind the counter and it took several minutes for anyone to ask to take our order. 
the kid was too busy in his conversation to listen to our order we had to repeat it multiple times! 
the rice was waaaaayyy over cooked it was like eating oatmeal in a burrito! the beans were disgusting! the meat was like grease soup! the tortillas were way over toasted that it was cracking and breaking. all around a horrible experience! 
some people seem to love it but theyre obviuosly high or have never tasted good food."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 3 stars - not because my food was bad (it was good) but because I feel that with all the other taco shops here in Phoenix, it just didn't stand out for me. The food was good like I said but I stood waiting for what seemed like forever for my shrimp tacos while my friend's order was put together in no time. When I asked where my order was they said they were making it fresh so I was confused. Are all orders not made fresh? Was it because I ordered shrimp? I wish they would have said something when ordered it. I didn't feel the \"wow\" factor. The friend I went with did say he had their Chronic Fries and they were phenomenal so might consider going back especially if the fries are fried in a dedicated fryer (no gluten cross contamination)."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place Saturday night and am elated that it's so close to where I live. The staff was very helpful and friendly as it was my first time going and didn't know what to get. I went with a carne asada California burrito and holy cow was is delicious!! Best one I've had in a couple years and definitely worth the $9 price tag. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place sucks everybody save your money and don't go there you would have more fun throwing your money out of the window and their attitude sucks if you want a good taco go to pepe"}
{"text":"Was very impressed with my first visit to Chrinic Taco! I loved that they offered a small burrito option, and the meat was seasoned to perfection! We also tried the chronic fries which were amazing! The atmosphere was very modern and cool, very similar to Chipotle but much better! Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was ok, I ordered from Uber eats and when I received my food it was cold. I probably won't order from them again, I make better pollo asado tacos with the help of costco"}
{"text":"Love the food. Love the veggie burrito. Staff are friendly. It's a fairly new location and they seem to be ironing out some kinks in service and procedure but nonetheless it's one of my go-to spots :). Oh and cool ambulance and a bar."}
{"text":"My first time coming to Chronic Tacos was during my lunch break. The line was to the door. It was about a 40min wait for me. I was getting a little frustrated cause I was taking a step every 10mins. I finally place an order and my burrito was alright. My carnitas that I had were dry. Was not a good experience for my first time here."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Went to this place for dinner a couple days ago. We should've known something was wrong with the chicken when the employee started inspecting it very closely. I got the Carne tacos and my husband got chicken. My tacos were good, no complaints. When the employee scooped the chicken he had inspected it very closely... as we got down the line the employee asked what my husband would like on the tacos. But then grabbed a piece of chicken off his taco, broke it open and inspected it again! This is when we probably should've walked away but we figured if something was wrong with the meat the employee wouldn't of served it to us.... well that wasn't the case.  we got served meat that was clearly bad. Needless to say my husband was up for three hours last night puking.... 

If the employee noticed the meat was bad why would he of served it to us ? We will never be back"}
{"text":"Was impressed but recently came in and how do you run out of fries?!?!? Then you have flies flying around the food under the glass landing on the food and no one who works there notices it.... I'm done and never going back..."}
{"text":"I would say if Chipotle had a Younger Rockstar brother. That would be chronic tacos. There is graffiti on the walls nothing offensive. But they are taking it down. :( The employees are friendly and personable and strike up great conversations. The menu has a little more diversity then chipotle but is set up with the assembly line. They have Tortas and Nachos and breakfast burritos. And just about everything comes with a vegetarian option not just the standard bean and cheese variety. They also have specials on Monday with Burritos and Tuesday is for the tacos. The burrito is massive filled with steak and your choice of rice and beans, cilantro, pico de gallo. When i frequent Summerlin i know where ill be."}
{"text":"Lunch for breakfast? Well hey it's Vegas!  I like Chronic Tacos, like them a lot!  We have them in South OC and I routinely go to them.  I walked into the Palms Casino food court and voila!  Chronic Tacos made it to Vegas!  Their food is expensive for what it is but that won't deter me from coming.  Service was slow on making a burrito though....but oh well."}
{"text":"**3.5 stars**

Chipotle but actually authentic-ish mexican food?

I got the giant burrito bowl with al pastor meat. YUM! Same concept at chipotle: you stand in line, choose the style you like (bowl, burrito, taco, salad, etc), choose your meat (or doubled), beans, veggies, salsas, and toppings. I had both the red and green salsas. Both were tasty, NONE were spicy which is why I gave this place a lower rating. I was a little disappointed in that because I CRAVE spicy salsa. The green one was my favorite one out of the two. 

Portions were huge and filling. I had 2 meals left over in my bowl after eating a quick (but filling) lunch. Price was good for the amount of food given.

The staff was SUPER friendly. I can't get over how helpful they were. Even in a fast paced chain, the servers still made time to explain each selection to me and make some perfect recommendations for me. They even had time to come by to my table and make sure I was doing well and to see if I was enjoying my food. 5+ stars for customer service! 

Environment: 5/5 
Food: 3/5
Price: 5/5
Service: 5/5"}
{"text":"The staff looked bored as they texted on their cell phones in between takin our order and putting the obviously-store bought tortillas on the warmer which clearly did not warm them up enough. The al pastor/carne asada were ok, the guacamole was good but overpowering. The food was ridiculously overpriced and underwhelming. The only thing going for this place is the location, though I wouldn't even spend comps to eat here again. You are MUCH better off at earl of sandwich right next to it."}
{"text":"overpriced, underseasoned 
$6.25 for a basic cheese quesadilla
steak was grissly and greasy with no seasonings 
we gave it a try but won't retun, Chipotle is just across the parking lot."}
{"text":"First time customer. I know this franchise has been around for a while but I just haven't made the time until today since I just moved into the area and am now very close to this location. I was really looking forward to some good eating. I let the tortilla warming lady know I was new. She said they are similar to chipotle. I requested some chronic fries for my kids. These are fried upon request apparently. I then asked for two tacos. She warmed them and put my meat on them. Then they sat in the air conditioned air on the cold metal plate until the cashier was done with her previous customer. Cold toppings were placed on my already cooled meat. We finally rang up my order but my fries were still cooking I guess. I asked how long it would be because I felt like there was a disconnect with my order. By the time I got the fries my tacos were totally room temp. The fries were not crispy. They were not fried at a high enough temperature. Soggy flimsy fries before toppings were placed on them is not enjoyable imo. It was a let down for me. As for flavors, everything was just ok. You can't please everyone. I get it. I don't plan to come back though sadly."}
{"text":"Truthfully, the best taco I have eaten in awhile (I focus on nutrition) therefore, label me a \"picky diner\". ALL of the ingredients tasted extremely  fresh...you basically build & \"customize\" your food; amazingly there is NO additional charge for guacamole unlike \"Chipotle\" that alone deserves five stars!
     I highly recommend this place, it is very affordable, and excellent quality  food, as well as, service."}
{"text":"I really really want to love this place, and food wise I pretty much do, but service is always off when I've been here. Everyone is friendly, don't get me wrong, but it seems like there is lack of coordination.. there has never been more than a person or two in front of me in line, and for some reason it still takes forever. Maybe the cashiers are new, I'm not quite sure. Takes a while to get rung up and people are always in and out of the back like they are searching for something. I've gotten some confused looks when I order a burrito.. maybe I mumble. Who knows. 

Enough of that: onto the important, the food. I like this place because they build your burrito in front of you but they have more options than other places (read: chipotle lol!). They have refried beans, different kinds of rice, and more topping options. The burritos I've gotten are always huge. You can add a drink and chips and salsa and make it a combo but at that point it's a little pricey and I'm too full from the burrito anyways. Decent spot to grab lunch and I do like their interior decor. It's pretty cool."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and quickly becoming my favorite place to enjoy taco Tuesday !!"}
{"text":"This place is like Chipotle but so much better. You can pick your meat, beans, rice, and toppings and put them into a taco or burrito and even a bowl! The flavors are enhanced. I couldn't stop eating even though I was full."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I had the carnitas it was moist and had the perfect amount of seasoning. I loved thier salsa and all the options for burritos and tacos. The customer service was very nice. They showed us the favorites and made sure we felt welcomed. I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Decided to visit Chronic Tacos in the charming Las Vegas suburb of Summerlin, Nevada. Glad I made the trip up from Los Angeles. The staff were super friendly, and helpful. I ordered a carnitas burrito, my two friends ordered a shrimp burrito, and a carnitas burrito, and we got two orders of flautas for the table, chicken and beef. I loved my burrito and the flautas. My friend said her carnitas was bland, a problem easily remedied with gringo bandito or some of their house salsa. The meal was overall very tasty. The wall of the restaurant features a Chronic Tacos logo over a huge skyline of the Las Vegas strip. It was cool, except people wrote stuff all over it with magic marker. The mens room was vandalized with graffiti too. This Chronic Tacos had it's own bar, and artwork painted and embossed into the floor: a giant taco, the corporate logo, the words: Chronic Tacos, among other things. A shaded dining area exists outside for al fresco dining on days the temperature drops below 100 degrees. Glad I came by Chronic Tacos in Summerlin, NV. It was a great way to spend my labor day lunch with friends."}
{"text":"Stumbled here to try it out. I've heard a few things about this place so I decided to try it out on the way to work.

Interior was nice and clean, they have bar seating and a few tvs.

Fail on the menu being on screens in the ceiling forcing you to look up to decide on what to eat.

I opted for the quesadilla with spicy pork. Asked for fresh jalapeños which they did not have only canned. (Not sure why places don't ever have fresh ingredients anymore). Food quality was alright nothing bad but also nothing good; the spicy salsa was the best part. Priced fair.

Not sure if I will return to a chronic taco in the near future. Hasn't left me with a sensation of I need to make it a point to goto this place again and again!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic find! I've driven by Chronic Tacos several times, but this was my first time in. I went with a small group (6 total) from work for lunch. Not only were we served quickly (we only have an hour lunch, including drive time to get to and from the office), but the food was delicious. I had a small chicken burrito combo and was very happy with the quality, taste and amount of food. Chronic Tacos is like a much better, nicer, hipper Chipotle."}
{"text":"First and only stop here. Prep line was slow.  Carne Asada was dry.  Charged over $6 for a chesse quesadilla.  No Coke or Dr. Pepper products in the fancy drink machine.  All indoor tables dirty, trash cans full to over flowing.  Too many other good places to get tacos in this town to put up with this."}
{"text":"Wow! Tacos made to order! (And much more) including my favorite beer! I love this place. Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"Good for la quick and fresh Mexican meal.  Highly recommend the chicken tacos with medium salsa."}
{"text":"First time. Food is alright, decent Mexican food, not authentic. Food was whatever. Digging the interior. Food at Zabas is better."}
{"text":"Of the best tacos ever. Absolutely love chronic tacos any minutes of the day. the staffs are very friendly and service is great, here at Palms place location."}
{"text":"Went to Chronic on taco Tuesday....tacos was 1.99...the meat was cold and the beans were trooooo salty....this was the second time I ate there and the food was horrible the 2ND time around....and the food is too expensive.;("}
{"text":"I took my son to eat here for lunch.  They made it hard for him to order (he is 7).  He couldn't really get any meat or melted cheese on his kids burro, so he got pinto beans and cold shredded cheese.  He would prefer Taco Bell.   i was 3rd in line and waited 20 minutes to order.   They forgot my taco and just seemed very dis-jointed.   Honestly unless something changes, Chipollte is just down the way and much more organized.   The manager was cool!  Although I asked him for salsa for my son and it never came."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I had 3 tacos - chicken, carne asada and carnitas. They were all packed with meat, it was way more than I expected. They were all delish, I wouldn't be able to choose a favorite. The service is great, I really appreciate the time that was taken to help out a first timer."}
{"text":"So....my coworker who sits directly across from me comes here all the time.  Everything he had brought back has looked good, so I decided that I needed to check it out.  I drove down today, parked, walked in and scoped out the menu for a minute.  I saw a \"California Burrito\" and it was calling my name.  I lived in the land of California Burritos (San Diego) for about 10 years, so I was hoping that Chronic Tacos version could come close to what I was used to.  

I stood there and talked with Andy for a few minutes while he was waiting for the fries to finish (freshly fried fries...good start to any CA burrito) and then we got down to business.  They stick a flour tortilla between a little press to warm it up.  The fries were layered perfectly, and then Andy started hooking up my burrito with the carne asada.  I went with a pretty traditional CA burrito (carne asada, fries, cotija and jack cheese, a little pico, sour cream and guacamole).  This burrito was fat!  Paid Andy my money (10% off with Yelp check in!) and took it back to work.  Here is how it was............

California Burrito-  The sheer size of this thing was impressive!  It was a beast!  I took it to go and I had about a 15 minute drive back to work, so I couldn't eat it immediately.  I think if I would have ate it there in the shop, it would have been a little bit better.  The fries had time to settle and weren't as crispy as they looked coming out of the fryer.  The carne asada was just a tad dry and had a little different type of seasoning on it.  It was good, but not great.  The rest of the ingredients were very good though.  Melted cheese, a ton of guacamole and sour cream.  It was a pretty solid CA burrito.  Best burrito I have had so far in AZ (that's not saying a whole lot lol!)

Overall, I thought it was pretty good.  If this was in San Diego, this would be a 3 star burrito.  Because it's in AZ, it gets a 3.5-4 star review.  Customer service was excellent.  Andy thanked me for coming in and said that he hoped to see me again soon.  He said that he loves seeing repeat customers and recognizable faces.  I appreciated that and I'm sure at some point when I am craving a burrito, I will make my way back down here.  There are other things on the menu I would like to try out."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for the first time yesterday. The decor of the place is really cool. The food was great however the portion sizes were very small for the prices we paid. Its pretty much the same as Chipotle however Chipotle is a lot more generous with their portions. Good for a one time stop but not interested in becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend in Las Vegas for lunch and was craving Mexican food.  Since I was staying at the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino, we just walked across Flamingo Blvd. to the Palms food court.  The tacos, as it implies in the name are very good and probably the best I've tasted from a chain restaurant.  I found out there are locations mostly in California, but also in Colorado, North Carolina, Washington, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Alabama.  

I ordered the carne asada tacos but avoided the hot sauce.  The were seasoned really good and the meat was super tender.  Caution: you can make a mess while eating this.  
The location makes it busy during lunch, so I would suggest going here around the lunch crowd"}
{"text":"Good food.  Had a carne asada burrito and it was delicious. Will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"Such friendly staff. Clean dining area, the food is always fresh and amazing. Arthur and the manager Jim were such a pleasure to talk to while my order was being made. I was also able to purchase a \"taco life\" T-shirt! I've wanted for ever. Love this place"}
{"text":"Only getting 3 stars because the 3 women working provided legit customer service. 

I'm a SoCal native and I've heard about chronic for years. Figured it was all hype \"which hype is over doing it for this establishment\". The food was absolute trash.. I wouldn't give it to a stray dog it was that bad. I tried to give the so called \"Asada\" some life with limes but I sweatergod that shit ain't work cuhz. I bit into my taco only to be taken to the Sahara desert. DRY. The tacos tasted like what I imagine those t shirts they shoot out of the cannons at sporting events would taste like \"given someone decided to eat one\". 

The place needs to change its name to chronic, but you'd literally have to be on that good good to ever want to eat there again."}
{"text":"First time visiting tonight, good quality. For $7 got a burrito that I could only eat half of. Very filling & good quality"}
{"text":"I work at the Guitar Center across the street from this place, and I always come here for my lunch break. Food is great and so is the service. Tacos, burritos, tostada bowls, all delicious."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get burritos It's NOT closed ! I come here often 
I'm obsessed with the shrimp and fish burrito it's always fresh and tasty and I love their sauce"}
{"text":"I love the el pastor taco and the pollo asado burrito. You can mix and match all the ingredients. It was fresh and the service was friendly, and efficient. I am going to get the big nachos with carne asada, next time. I saw these on someone else's plate and I cant wait to try them.
I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delish and friendly! My favorite part is the variations of ingredients to add to you choice of meal."}
{"text":"Every single time I drive here at 8:40 they have a sign or the doors are locked because they close at 9 but everywhere online it says 10. I stopped coming here because whenever I wanted it for dinner they were closed. HEY MANAGER JUST IN CASE YOU SEE THIS YOU SHOULD UPDATE WHAT EVERYTHING SAYS ONLINE. Complete crap"}
{"text":"Don't go!  They are seriously understaffed.  The manager didn't know how to change the syrup in the soda machine.  She said she would get right on it but kept working on orders.  By the time she got to the machine it became apparent she didn't know what she was doing and would have to call the owner.  Meanwhile, tacos got cold and soggy.  Bad enough, the carne asada had run out and I got cold remnants.  Good bye!"}
{"text":"Food was bland and old. I paid extra for old chewy steak that I spit most of it out. Salsa was very good though. The best part was the churro bites. The customer service of the girls on the line was nonexistent."}
{"text":"These tacos will not get you \"faded.\"
+ Baja style fish tacos are outstanding
- It has a very \"bro\" atmosphere
+ The service is friendly"}
{"text":"This Resturant has the worst service i have ever seen. 
I waited 3-4 minutes looking for someone to take my order. They finally came out from the back and said \"what do you want\" arms folded and major attitude. 
Proceeding with my order the female employee was yelling thru the window trying to get the cooks attention. He was still hiding in the back. When he finally came out they were laughing and making jokes. One i remember was \"did you tie the trash bags?\" With a laugh to follow. Insinuating he was working with trash in the back. 
The steak tacos were terrible ( we threw them out) the fish was ok, the shrimp was really good and the potatoes was awesome! 
I eat chronic tacos in cali when i visit. Shrimp and potato were the same as cali. The rest were not. 

They need to hire new staff and work on customer service. 
Visited the palms food court on 11/17/17 on a Friday around 1-2 pm."}
{"text":"With a name like Chronic Tacos, you'd think this place would serve some bomb tacos, they don't. They should change the name to seedy brick weed tacos. 

Nothing was fresh, tortillas were cold, tacos are way over priced and the staff was poorly trained. Management here must be non existent, no one knows what the other person is doing and there is no type of order at all. Had high expectations that were quickly let down."}
{"text":"By far some of the best customer service and some of the best Tacos and burritos in town!! Has the easy service style of chipotle with so many more options as far as meats, topping, and entrees!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"By far one of the worst places I have been to. Beans were dry and meat was bland. My daughter wouldnt eat her \"taquitos\" gross meat with tiny tirtilla.Service was limited it seemed as if none of the employees knew what to do."}
{"text":"Went here during my lunch break, the man behind the counter wouldn't stop talking to the customer in front of us, the only other customer in the store. It took a total of 19 minutes to make a burrito, which I couldn't eat until i was off because of the time it took to make. when an employee offered \"Jaret\" help, he refused it and continued taking his time to talk to the person in front of us and slowly put together a burrito. Not coming back here. The food was really good though"}
{"text":"This place had great tacos, and they were open late.  Apparently it's a chain and one of the guys from Jackass owns some?  Wee Man I think? Good tacos."}
{"text":"There is nothing chronic about this place AT ALL. You can't have the name chronic in the title of your establishment and deliver some sub-par/mediocre tacos. This place is a knock off chipotle or qudoba. Meat was fatty with no flavor, chips not authentic, shortage on ingredients, place was terrible. Definitely wouldn't go back, even if it was free. Best part of our meal was the drink machine. People were nice and the place was clean, just needs some work on the actual food. My wife and I were excited to try this place and left extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Overpriced.  The menu is confusing and they nickel and dime you. You want this add this much. You want this, add this much. 

The veggie taco... My choice of veggies was lettuce, cabbage or onions. When I pointed to the menu and said it says veggies. I was told I could get the Fajita veggies for $1.50. That would be over $4 for one taco that didn't have meat!!!! 

I also find it funny the owner posted a review as if he was only a customer."}
{"text":"Wish I could write a no star review for this restaurant.  This restaurant is a cheap rip off of chipotle, one in which they obviously try to outdo chipotle and fail miserably.  

What you have here is them covering up their lack of quality with an attempt at mexican spices which they fail at.  I'm a white guy but living in vegas I know mexican and southwestern food...and this is a laughing stock if thats what you call it.  This is food for dumb americans.  Its completely inauthentic.  And they literally call themselves mexican food...at least chipotle doesn't do that.  

They drench their food in lime and spices to cover up the fact that its got no real flavor or quality.  Its pathetic.  And somehow theyre more expensive than chipotle!  And yet they skimp on ingredients and its obvious that this place is incredibly cheap when it comes to quality.  When I ordered there and asked for peppers they gave me a tiny spoonful of what were overcooked shrivelled up pathetic looking peppers that were obviously day old.  Disguisting.  I had to ask for new ones and wait for them to make them.  

Then when I tasted the food I was astonished that all I tasted was lime juice and red pepper.  I absolutely love lime but my god theres a limit people.  

I tried going back a second time and getting something else but didnt even make it through the ordering process because when I was asking about the ingredients I was getting completely different answers than I had from the first person who served me....super sketchy...you don't even know what your eating its completely untrustworthy.  I just walked away.  And I suggest you do too and go to chipotle or better yet an authentic mexican restaurant than this bogus americanized franchise that is really just trying to rip you off and serve you complete bullshit."}

Love all their food so far. Tacos are so good. Rice and beans kill it. Carne asada, pastor...delicioso!"}
{"text":"The place and people was nice but that's not what I was looking for in s taco.  Bland on the taste and the Baka sauce taste mostly like mayo.   But on the other hand my husband enjoyed his chronic fries."}

{"text":"This was a great ending toy last Vegas trip. We were buzzed looking for some munchies and came across chronic tacos $1 potato tacos.. SCORE! So cheap and so good! I could have had a dozen to myself! 

They have this wonderful crispy shell and the potatoes are wonderfully seasoned.  I love veggies so I piled on the lettuce, pico, and whatever else I could find. I recommend the hot salsa as well, gotta have it spicy!"}
{"text":"Growing up in Orange County with many trip to San Diego and eating countless amounts of tacos... this place is fantastic!! I ordered the carnitas tacos and they were picture perfect and crazy delicious. I'm stoked I found this place. A must try. 

I'm reading a lot of bad reviews about the service being poor (not in my experience) but you can't argue about the food being great. I'm a street taco lover and these fit the bill. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Love the food here but don't bother placing online orders but when u come to pick up, it's never ready. You WILL HAVE TO WAIT."}
{"text":"Something new for me. Instantly I liked the decor of the place inside. The black t shirts the staff wear are cool too. Basically like chipotle or qboba pick your stuff have it built add ins etc. food is good a little pricier than the two places I mentioned two lines up. There is a small bar in the corner where you can order a margarita or have a beer with your food as well. The mini churros are a plus too for dessert. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Hmmmm.... I wanted these tacos to be good.   I was told not to try them because I would be disappointed and man I should have heeded that advice. 

First, they were out of quite a few items.   Now I understand if it were later at night but it was 7pm.  They should not be out of carne asada at this time.   I think that that's an item you must keep constantly stocked on a Friday at 7pm.

Also the line they kept the food in was a little disheveled and dirty looking.   I know it gets busy especially if there's any event at the pearl but cleanliness is important.   The guy tried to clean up a little but then didn't change his gloves to start touching the food again. 

The flavor of the tacos wasn't anything to write home about either.  I appreciate that you can top them however you want but that doesn't add much for me.   Especially when nothing really tastes that great anyway."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but these burritos = bomb.com. I've been there nearly 7 times over the last month, and I usually get a 1/2 chicken and 1/2 al pastor burrito - that combination can't be beat. They also have Chronic Nachos which are essentially one of their huge burritos dumped on top of a bed of chips and covered with cheese. Seriously, you need these in your life."}
{"text":"We've driven by numerous times but just never went in. We kept saying we needed to try it out. We finally did. Although it was a half hour before close, the guys were extremely accommodating and helpful. Having never been there, they walked us through the menu and gave their suggestions. That started off the experience on the right foot and a much appreciated gesture. The tacos themselves were delicious. The beer battered shrimp was probably some of the best I've had in a while. My wife and I will definitely be back! Thank you for the great experience."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this place on a whim around 2pm, and absolutely loved it here!

Food- I got the Carne Asada Quesadilla, and let me just say that the food looked fresh, and it was a great helping. I even had to take some to-go. The Quesadilla was smoky, flavorful, and cheesy. 

Atmosphere- This place definitely is modern, and I can imagine it has a great night crowd because they serve the same food, but the bar is open on the side which has a good amount on tap. There were multiple TV's going when we were there, which worked out well because I wanted to watch the Game, and my friend wanted to watch the News.

Parking- Plenty of parking around this place, it should be no problem.

Staff- Staff was very attentive, and worked very well with us, considering it was our first time, so they walked us through it, and even recommended her favorite meal to us, which was great

Definitely recommend coming here if you have the chance!"}
{"text":"The food is great! We're making this a regular go to place for tacos! The service is very good and the owner is very personable. Try it and you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"The owner, Brad, is great!! Kept making suggestions to better my experience there. Food is good too! The first time I went they were a little slow but seems as if they've picked it up and are starting get people through the line quicker. Overall, I was pleased!"}
{"text":"We love this place back in CA and we're happily surprised to find them opening here. We finally made it out there and we're disappointed; it just wasn't the same. I have been to several so this was a fluke, maybe because they haven't been open long. The nachos were like half the size of the normal with hardly any meat or beans. We love this place and will give it another try but if it is mediocre again we will save it for trips back to CA. And what kind of Mexican place has the gringo bandito and all the hot sauce behind the counter????"}
{"text":"We want to go back but it's so frustrating. Wait in line forever for like 2 people and then we get to order. We got 3 shrimp tacos and some nachos this last time. 34 min9later we got our food. Really?! By the time we got our food it was cold too. This same thing has happened before. Come on guys, this place could be awesome but you drag your feet and do the even care. Get it together please."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Had run out of pico de gallo... who runs out of pico??? Mexican/Spanish rice wasnt cooked all the way through and was al dente. Food was eh definitely did not meet the hype that was built up."}
{"text":"Fair rating because the food wasn't bad.

Was hoping for this spot to be something new, but disappointed that it was just a variant of Cafe Rio/Chipotle. Menu lacked any type of explanation which can be confusing when everything is labeled as \"chronic.\"

Impressed by the actual size of burrito and nice that they offer a smaller burrito version but overall simply wasn't impressed. Seemed rather expensive. I'll give it another shot, but there are many other places I'd visit first."}
{"text":"I LOVE that this location just opened up! Everything was super fresh and clean. There was a bit of a line but they had enough people working that the line moved really fast. 

The nachos are fantastic with lots of ingredients to choose from. The pollo asado was tender and well seasoned. I was really excited that the refried beans were vegetarian (lower fat and calories than traditional refried beans). Both their green and red salsas were tasty. 

The nachos are easily big enough to split with a friend."}
{"text":"Was interested in seeing if this place was any good. Bottom line is, just go to chipotle. I love tacos but this place was mediocre at best. The guacamole (which was extra) was bland and tasteless. The carne asada was tough. The mild, medium, and hot salsa seem to all be mild - no variation in temperature.  The ice tea was horrible and to top it off the staff seemed like they weren't sure what was going on and that they wanted to be anywhere else but at work. I understand not liking your job but at least fain liking it. The only saving grace making this a two star review v. A one start review, were the churro bites. They were delicious! All in all don't waste your time or money. If you want authentic then go to Los Tacos. If you want chipotle, then just go there. This knock off isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I was left disappointed even though my expectations were low from the beginning upon looking at the display counter.  My experience reminded me of a less healthy, less flavorful, less quality wannabe Chipotle. They should change the name to \"Chronic cold burritos\" because that is what they sold me. The canned beans, meat and rice were cold and I questioned the health standards by the looks of meat sitting in a tin uncovered and exposed. This joint was a hot mess as their store bought packages of tortillas lay all around and meat, cheese, salsa were all over the place, you would think that one of the 10 motionless employees standing back there would think to wipe up the residue and food scraps laying all over the damn place. I am beyond disappointed and want my money back for the two burritos we bought as I feel ripped off. 

The service sucks ass and is not the friendly excited crew that you would think Steve-O would have operate his joint. This staff had the personality of a Nun being presented with a dildo, it lacked enthusiasm or any sort of care in the world. Just because you have tattoos does not make you automatically cool, I have a few as well big deal so what I like to draw on myself.

Store bought tortillas heated up and stuffed with canned beans, cold meat and hard tasteless rice does not settle right on my stomach. This was our first and last visit to this joint. We will continue giving Chipotle our business, where the food is hot, fresh, tasty and clean that comes with great service. 

I have a feeling this joint will NOT be around for long."}
{"text":"Friendly service and really good food! We ordered a small burrito and a taco, both with chicken. The taco seemed a bit overpriced but the small burrito was a good value. The chicken was great - moist and flavorful, as were the salsas. The tortilla was a bit dry but otherwise we had a great experience."}
{"text":"My coworker suggested Chronic Tacos to me and the next morning I immediately thanked him.

I had a Chronic Salad and added all the usual's that I would at similar restaurants.  Everything at Chronic had such great flavor, the pollo, salsa, beans, there wasn't a bad bite!

Highly recommend trying this out, especially if you are a fan of similar places."}
{"text":"Not as good as traditional street tacos by any stretch of the imagination but sooooo much better than chipotle or cafe rio. the asada is not as flavorful but it is still good and the corn tortillas are not really corn but ok as well. the salsa is not as ~hot~ as i prefer but it wasnt bad either. it is overpriced but this is the closest taco joint i have near to my house for the moment so i deal with it. overall the tacos are quality but do not expect street tacos."}
{"text":"High prices. Taco Tuesday doesn't apply to fish tacos. Seems to be competing in same market as Chipotle."}
{"text":"The employees here seem to not want to be here. No one smiles. They just seem irritated. I came in by muself and it was slow so I'm not sure what is going on with the staff. I told the staff that I had never been here before,  expecting some guidance and they were just silent. 

Even if the food is good I wouldnt recommend this place because of the poor service."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place, so now that I drive around for work I got the chance to try in while on this side of town. Walking in, its a very clean restaurant and the employees were very nice and explained how you order and how many options they had. I went with the small burrito, because eating a huge ass burrito then going back to work outdoors doesn't mix well, im sure a big one would put me to sleep. I got \"carne asada\" and toppings. I was a bit disappointed because the menu clearly states CARNE ASADA, however as I ate I knew it wasn't. I knew it was steak, which is fine, but they shouldn't say carne asada on the menu. The Burrito was ok, to me the salsa was a fail, HOT salsa should not be mild and smoky...

My co worker got the Chronic fries. It took a while to make the fries and afterwards he had the same thing to say.... They were just \"ehhh\"... They did warn him they put you to sleep, and 30 min later he is knodding off.... LOL. He said he feels sluggish, HAHAHAHA! 

Personally, I wouldn't really go out of my way for this place. After discussing with my co worker, it seems like they are trendy and that's what is making them popular. The cost isn't really cheap either. so for the cost and what you get ill keep driving next time."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is SO SLOW! I waited in line for over 20 minutes and there were only 4 people ahead of me. After I ordered my food I waited for another 10 minutes. Don't come here for your lunch break. And they play the music so loud you can't even hear them call your order. Also, my shrimp burrito had like 6 pieces of shrimp. So it was basically crap."}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss. First visit was quick, second was painfully slow (partially due to the customer in front of us who was incredibly rude - to everyone - and kept adding things to her giant order). I love their carne asada tacos though, so I'll probably keep coming back. Just keep in mind it might take a while.

Side note, the first time we ate here the refried beans were unbearably salty. We couldn't even eat them. I haven't risked trying them again yet to know if it was a fluke or not. Chips and rice were good, green salsa is delicious!

It's a little expensive for tacos. About 9 bucks just for 2 carne asada tacos, which are a little bigger than other places like Pinche's, but still feels overpriced. Guacamole is included in the carne asada price which is annoying since I don't want that on my tacos - give me onion, cilantro, lime juice and green salsa and I'm a happy girl."}
{"text":"Meh. I've had chronic tacos in the OC and it tasted so much better than the one here.

The chips were stale.
Salsa lacked flavor.
They skimmed on the amount of meat.
since its in vegas, it's also more expensive but that wouldn't have mattered to me if the quality were the same :/

This review would have just been 1 star, but +1 for giving a lot of guacamole and sour cream"}
{"text":"This restaurant is really really good. It beats chipoltle. Everytime i come in i feel welcome, and the bathrooms are always very very clean. Teresa is very nice and pleasent, and always shows an interest in my day. She goes above and beyond the expectations of customer service. I worked at Arbys for 9 years, so i know what the food industry is like. She is very nice and professional, and really does a great job. She makes the experience at Chronic Taco that much better."}
{"text":"Love going to this place with friends or business partners always clean and always warm and fresh! I even sport their sticker on my phone"}
{"text":"A step above Chipotle. A few more menu options, better meat and salsa, a few different (not necessarily more) ingredients, etc. Great stuff. Al Pastor!"}
{"text":"This place is great! First off the staff is super chill and attentive.  Also the owner is almost always hanging out.   I get the carnitas for the most part, sometimes cane asada.  Normally I don't get carnitas but they were really good so I kept getting them. True story. 

Small burrito is a great deal and not that small in fact!"}
{"text":"Wasn't bad, but wasn't great. Order the carne asada tacos, and was left underwhelmed. Meat was chewy and not flavorful. The guacamole was the only selling point of the whole taco. My husband got the carne Asada fries and he didn't mind it, fries were good. The decor is really nice and looked like it was going to have potential but came up short. We both have heard people love the place and we both agreed we rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I had a Groupon and decided to check it out. 

I tried the chicken burrito, while my fella ordered the chicken enchiladas. My burrito was ok, a little lacking in flavor, but I did ask for the salsa on the side, so that could be my fault. Once I poured some of the green stuff on there, it was pretty good. My fella's enchiladas stole the show. They were melty and cheesy, just how I like them! They were filled to the brim with moist and meaty chicken. It was all white meat, we were quite surprised and impressed. This was my favorite thing about the meal. 

This isn't authentic Mexican food by any stretch of the imagination and I think some of their dishes lack flavor, but it was still pretty good for the price.

Not a big fan of the decor. It's obviously targeting a younger crowd, which is fine. A little too scuffed up and graffiti'd for my taste. Boy, do I sound old! Haha

Overall, pretty good experience. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but if I'm in the area or have another Groupon on my hands, I'm totally there."}
{"text":"Since Brad reached out to me I am changing my review to 3 stars. My visit was still a 2 star experience but when a business owner reaches out it has some merit. 

Been wanting to try since they opened. Finally decided too on a early Friday evening. Our first clue when walking inside how are experience was going to be was the place was empty. Absolutely no other customers. 

I have to say the 2 ladies working the line were great. Both were pleasant and likeable. A star for each of them.

Husband ordered a carne asada burrito, I ordered 2 fish tacos, kid ordered a cheese quesadilla.  The concept is exactly like the guys down the street on the corner. My fish was fried to order. 

Other half said his burrito had no flavor even with the addition of salsa. My tacos looked good but the fish had a odd taste and were extremely soggy. The tortilla had more texture. The guac that I asked for on the side was a salt bomb. I only ate about 3/4th of one taco, the other ended up in the trash. Nothing special about about the quesadilla. Chips that came with the dilla were the best part of the meal and the Coke Freestyle machines.

This place could be great if the food had lived up to par. The vibe was good and service was above average. We probably won't be back and it might explain why it was still empty when we left. If you are a beer drinker domestic bottles are only $2.50."}
{"text":"Do not eat! The pork slop called Al Pastor tasted like a slimy pile of seasoned salt covered in horse crap that was 2 weeks old. The carne asada tasted like salty dog food. The torrillas were like hard card board. I tried to cover the awful taste with over priced guacamole because I was starving, and it was alright, and the also several day old pico was almost edible. The staff who looked like they had been up for a couple days straight were pretty nice. I want to go make myself puke."}
{"text":"Ordered a Burrito, when I asked for lettuce I got cabbage. The server then proceeded to stick her hands in the burrito and pull pieces of the cabbage out. I asked to please stop and just add lettuce. I asked for no cheese and said \"no cheese I have an allergy\" however the entire time she continued to put her right hand in the cheese bowl before asking what I wanted next, as if this was her zero position.  

Then came the eats, if you want a burrito with the same flavor you can get one for a quarter of the price at Del Taco. This place is gross. Chronic Tacos failed. I think I got more grease from the bottom of the serving boat than chicken, regardless the flavor was just not good.

Don't waste your time, there is better food in this city."}
{"text":"I came here after work last night. Checked the website and they closed at 9pm. Imagine my surprise when I found parking walked up to the door and they were locked at 8:33pm. With people sitting in there eating. 

I had gone with some friends this past weekend and although my food was fine, they were out of Spanish rice. Which they told my friends it would be a couple minutes. Then the guy burnt the rice which turned into 30 minute wait. Then they were out of steak. It wasn't very busy so I don't know why they waited until customers came in to start making the rice. 

I'll give it one more try, but it's nothing like the Chronic Tacos in California."}
{"text":"This place is average at best. My chicken was all dark meat, which isn't my fave. Also lacked flavor.  Hubby had the carnitas, which he said was lacking and he left half of it (unusual for him). Service wasn't bad, but not great. It took them a while to check us out. This place is definitely competing with Chipotle and Cafe Rio. I would much rather go to either of those than come here again."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place, my daughter loves it, so we went to have lunch. I had the carne asada tostada bowl and chips with salsa.  For me it is all about the salsa,  however the salsa here is average.  I didn't think it was fresh and flavourful l like I would have expected. Everything was a little I'm the salty side. Probably not going back."}
