{"text":"Pho Xua  1768 st clair ave west.  Pleasant surprise! The food is decent and the atmosphere and service is nice. Has an upscale feel. Ideal for couples and small groups.  We ordered a variety of fried rolls and appetizers; grilled shrimp and veggies skewered on a kebab, and bunh vermicelli, all of which were excellent. The Tiger beer was a refreshing change. The only disappointment were the fried squid which would have been better with more breading/crunchier.  All in all, a fantastic local eatery and a great addition to the Corso Italia/Junction north neighborhood of Weston-Pelham park."}
{"text":"I went here today and ordered the rice with grilled chicken and steamed egg. They brought my dish without the steamed egg hoping that I wouldn't notice! ! I asked about it and the server went to the back to ask.  The cooks in the back said they ran out...and they failed to let the customer know. .so they sent it out hoping I wouldn't notice? !not acceptable.  So deceitful. Food wasn't great either.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have had a lot of Pho-rice noodles soup in my life.Yet, this restaurant actually has the best taste of Pho because of its very unique flavor that I can not find at any other Vietnamese restaurant. I was impressed with the charming interior decor and  food presentation. It's an amazing place for a family gathering, friend reunion, and date night. Excellent service, reasonable price. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"I went on here on a recommendation of a friend. I found the food was very very very bland. We had chicken wings,  pad thai, fish soup, Vietnamese salad, beef and veggies,  fried fish. We only paid $100 dollars for everything but it was kinda pricey compared to other Vietnamese restaurants. Overall the food was pretty bland and didn't have the rich Vietnamese flavours or spices that Vietnamese food should have. It honestly tasted like I was eating food was 0 seasoning and flavour. The decor is a bit overdone as well in my opinion, more sophisticated than a regular viet restaurant but way too much. But I do give them props because my baby niece knocked over a cup and they did not charge us."}
{"text":"The food was very good, the pho has a traditional northern flavour to it so it might taste different to others. The restaurant was really clean and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"This Viet-Thai restaurant opened 10 months ago. The interior is new with modern finishes. There is a Thai section at the end of the menu. The other review saying it's only Northern Viet food might've missed it. Also it says \"Viet-Thai\" right on Pho Xua's logo.  I've ordered twice so far. XL Pho with lightly fat brisket meat. Both times were decent but different. 1st time the meat tasted a little overcooked and not as flavourful. It looked like a leaner cut of meat than usual with not much fat on it. And the noodles were more al dente than usually found in Toronto Pho spots. I still finished it all. 2nd time the meat and noodles were perfect but the broth was oily. I still finished it all. /fat  The portions are awesome here too."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere and thought the food was very good. I had pad Thai and my bf had pho. I'd like to try more adventurous dishes next time."}
{"text":"This place is traditional Northern Vietnamese cuisine. It's not Thai as the other review suggested. Food is authentic; the Pho here has a Northern flavour. The decor looks good."}
{"text":"Hands down best pho ever!! My partner and I have tried many place around the city even tried pho in Barrie (don't ask) this place is so flavourful and if you ask for it a little more spicy the cook will actually accommodate it, as a pose to everywhere else they will say \"sorry, you can just add siracha sauce\" like really?!   Anyone who gave this place a 1 star has no idea about food and flavour."}
{"text":"I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS RESTAURANT! We r regulars and ordered from Just Eat. We were so starving I had a headache. It was 7pm so very late dinner and we just wanted to eat. badly! They made us wait a whole hour then cancelled the just order following a phone call saying it's too busy, we cancelled your Order!!!!! I'm beyond pist! And all they offered us was a $10 voucher! LIKE R U fuc*$#! Kidding ME!"}
{"text":"Very clean space, cute decor, nice waitress greeted and seated us quickly. Well it also wasn't busy which I'm surprised  but either way the food was great. I see that they have more take outs but the dine is I believe is just as Good! Very comfy atmosphere. Good amount of food and fresh , simple presentation , would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service the manager welcomed us and she slightly changed the typical menu according to our tastes which was really appreciated. Loved to have the warm tea pot. I tried the tonkinoise soup was ok but not the best I've tried. However the agar dessert was very yummy"}
{"text":"Good place,  enjoyed three dishes and the food came hot and ready to eat.   You know a good place when they are busy.   This is my 3ed time back.   Great for two or four couples."}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times and now just tried out their delivery service through JustEat.  Delivery time was estimated to be 1.5 hrs. (!) but it arrived in 35 mins.  Delicious Pho Xua Special and Ha Noi Wonton Egg Noodle Soup, so flavourful and generous portion size.  Would definitely order again!"}
{"text":"I live near Pho Xua and their convenient online ordering for pick-up is a huge reason why I go to this place so, damn, do I want it to do better! Avoid the bun or anything with vermicelli, really; it is consistently overcooked, soft, and gross and the meat usually blackened and overcooked. Their Thai fried rice is a go-to, but the flavouring is inconsistent; some days it is bland and then last week I am pretty sure they accidentally dumped a cup of black pepper into the dish and it was inedible. I've been making my way through the Chef's specials and they have all been solid; the crab rolls were a standout. The food here is generally good enough to keep me going back for an easy pick-up dinner but I just wish they could be more consistent."}
{"text":"NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN. Inedible.  I was ravenous when I ordered and it arrived more than an hour later.  I wasn't going to be picky.   But: My food arrived cold. And nothing is truly tasty. The tender yummy barbecued  pork I crave was tough (noooooo!) in the vermicelli dish;  the fried calamari was soggy. Soggy batter surrounding  cold rubber bands. Inedible. The yellow curry was fine.  Totally disappointed. I just threw 80% of my $40 order in the garbage."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here every other week. Best Pho spot in town. The staff are nice. Quick service. Pad Thai is delicious!"}
{"text":"Eeek Me thinks not, just explains perfectly my feelings after making the mistake of visiting this joint yesterday.  I ordered few times from them through \"Just-eat\", but it wasn't that bad. The pho wouldn't have the option of well done so they would send the meat just rare (which I would dumped to enjoy the broth with some of my veggies and their noodles; but I remember the appetizers were ok tho. However, after yesterday's culinary nightmare, they are on my black list for delivery, visiting, recommend, or even remember they exist (can't tell why).  Yesterday we arrived there and they had some tables, but the service took too long not only to come and deliver the menus, but also to take the order after several waves and keeping our eyes on the waiter... I even suggested my partner to leave, but he said we were already in there (I should've listened to my Thunder cat 6th sense).  To make the story short because they don't even deserve more words, they gave a pho made with the first boiled water they put in a pot. Did they considered us dumb?, not having taste or tongue at all? or they just don't care about their business anymore? Who cares? But I felted so offended when I tried it, that I just needed to stand up, walk to the counter where the busy waiter was enjoying a personal phone call (while ignoring again our waves), touch his shoulder and tell him I needed him at our table.  When he came we said we wouldn't pay a cent for that insulting pho. My soup wasn't bad, so I just ordered a container to go. After he screamed at the kitchen, he came back, apologized to us saying \"it did taste like shit...\" and that the cooker just missed some ingredient (yeah, 7 hours of cooking the broth).  Arggg, I will post this at just-eat too because we customers don't deserve to waist our time and money waiting for being angry, especially when you are hungry."}
{"text":"Excellent quality! There are not many North Vietnamese places in Toronto and this one is a gem. The Pho is super tasty, the house special P2 - Cha Ca La Vong is amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent pho.  I had the deluxe pho - rare steak, well done steak, flank, and meatball.  It was delicious.  They brought plenty of the fixins to go with it too - thai basil, bean sprouts, lime wedges, and peppers.  I also had imperial rolls - fired well and served with a yummy peanut sauce. Service was pretty good, and there was no corkage fee.  The employees didn't seem to mind the slightly drunken group of us either (probably because it was 2 pm and the place was empty besides us). Great choice by us..."}
{"text":"It's Monday night, I'm just myself for noodle soup Pho, with rare beef, beef fat and beef ball.  Food taste decent, peaceful atmosphere and everything look clean.  It's cold outside, and the lady brought me a nice cup of jasmine tea, so enjoyable."}
{"text":"This restaurant misses the mark. The service on a Saturday night took forever and all we ordered was pho and spring rolls. There was a child serving us who needed a lot of guidance, brought our group of three one set of chopsticks and spoon...? water refills had to be asked for. We kept ourselves busy by spotting spelling mistakes in the menu: salat, canadiun, chickken, Inport, etc.  Once the spring rolls came, they were burnt in a few places and the filling was something similar to eastern european fare - mushrooms and pork, overall too greasy. The pho was too salty and just had 1/3 of the soup. It should be fragrant but it was just just a sodium smell. That taste was enough for us to not order more."}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese restaurant in Montreal. The food is outstanding. I love their pork chop on rice. They spiced it to perfection. The owners are very nice also. I always experience great service from them. A MUST TRY VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT in Montreal."}
{"text":"Food's very authentic and delicious! Decor is a bit over the top but if it's your thing... lol. Again the food is amazing so I'd still make the trip to the restaurant even though it's a bit out of my way."}
{"text":"Looking for a big comfortable bowl of Pho, after a long day with the family, and wrapping up ballet class for my daughter at Dufferin and St. Clair. A quick Yelp pointed us to a spot next door, but we opted for this place as it was busier inside, had a fresh decor and looked more inviting. We weren't disappointed.  We had our 3 kids, who are a bit rambunctious, yet didn't seem to faze the patrons or the restauranteurs. We kept things pretty traditional, Pho, Pad Thai, crispy veg spring rolls, but with the exception of my Ban Hue, and all were fabulous. I enjoyed the spice levels, and even cranked it up with the on demand chilli oil, extra fresh chillies on the side and home made garlic and hot chilli.   The food is flavourful, broth is great, and if you like hot spice, prepare to sweat. This place will become a more regular spot for me, but I'll have to try the lol and dad place next door.   Lastly, they had as my son said \"washrooms that smell like a hotel, and very clean\". Why can't all Pho places, or restaurants for that matter take cleanliness of a washroom seriously. This alone makes me say they deserve a fifth star -- you know what, 5/5 it is."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by someone who is from Hanoi, VN. They said that this place is the closest it comes to getting bun cha Hanoi and cha ca La Vong like it's served in Hanoi. I tried it for myself and he was not wrong. Although not quite exactly as good as in Vietnam - it beats all the other restaurants Ive tried that serve these dishes.   This place is the first place where I've seen the waitresses wear the traditional vietnamese dress aka ao dai - very nice touch. We also ordered the lotus root salad aka goi ngo sen - it had good crunch, balance, but lacked spice - so we added the crushed chili paste to it to give it extra kick. Bun cha was good - but I wished there was more cha to it - as opposed to grilled pork aka thit nuong as filler. Cha Ca did not come in a sizzling hot pot like in VN - but the flavours were really good, some might say a little bit on the salty side...but you can balance that with the vermicelli and veggies/herbs.   They also make freshly squeezed juices. I had the orange, pineapple and lemon drink - tasty.  Overall, I would def recommend to anyone looking to eat their specialty dishes - bun cha ca hanoi and cha ca la vong. Fairly priced, good service, good food. Happy to have found a place to satisfy my cravings."}
{"text":"Fresh tasting food, the spring rolls are absolutely amazing , the cold rolls are great too . They also serve Thai dishes . Our go to place for Vietnamese spring rolls !!!"}
{"text":"Don't ever order from here. Dining in might be different; I'm not sure. But don't order in.  They missed an entire item, one of the broth containers was partially open (so our napkins were soaked and unusable), one of the hoisin sauce containers has literally probably about a half-teaspoon of sauce in it. The beef balls are chewy and flavourless. The broth had to be reheated, because it wasn't even hot enough to brown the meat at all.  I have had to call three times, twice because I was promised a call back and it never came. It took the third phone call (and fourth time explaining the problem) for them to ask what I wanted them to do about it -- I had to confirm that yes, I wanted them to send them out. I've been hung up on all four calls, and they just called to ask if I wanted the delivery guy to deliver the food an hour and a half ago, or if I wanted him to return the four dollars that I paid for this item instead.  NEVER order delivery from here. Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"...lie saying usa currency is the same  shitty service  forgot a item shrugs  his shoulder.."}
{"text":"Satay!  Spicy satay pizazz at its best.  Noodle meals came a bit heavy on the noodles.  Unlike other Vietnamese places, Pho Xua doesn't skimp on the meat.  Pro tip: if you're picking food up make sure you know which restaurant you've ordered from because there are at least three Vietnamese places between Old Weston and Blackthorn.  Don't do what I did, which was to go into the wrong restaurant searching for my take out order only to make the owners direct me to their competitor."}
{"text":"This restaurant so yummy and I recommend all my friends to come here. The taste is very different than others restaurant I have tried in Toronto. This is called bun dau mam tom, if u are foreigner, u should try it one more time, maybe u will fall in love with our shrimp paste lol.  Bun bo hue, Bun oc Ho Tay, Bun ca Hai Phong also very good.  Come to try!!!"}
{"text":"i give this restaurant 2.5 stars.  i usually go couple of doors down.. but since its new i wanted to try it. it empty when i went on a weekday for dinner.  prices are slightly higher.. and food tasted okay.. nothing special.  the worse part was we got charged for fish sauce..  nowhere else have i ever been charged for fish sauce for the rice... unheard of... i took a picture of the bill to show.  anyways.. i will probably not return and stick to the two viet places next door which may not look as nice but is priced and tastes better..."}
{"text":"Went here Boxing Day 2016, the only reason why we stepped foot in this place was the actual Viet restaurant we were looking for closed down. If I could give half a star I totally would...  1. Avocado milkshake= tasted like ice and condensed milk, where was the avocado 2. Pho with beef balls and sliced beef= all I could taste was oil, why you ask cuz all I could see was a layer of oil, also very cheap with the bean sprouts and mint, 3. Seafood noodle (chef special) all you could taste was garlic"}
