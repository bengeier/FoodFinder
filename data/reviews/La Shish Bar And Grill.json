{"text":"They provide cheap & good foods but it takes ages to get it.........I waited over half an hour for my order"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst sheesha place I have been to! The staff makes it seem like anything you ask them is a chore, makes you feel bad for asking.   When we ordered two sheesha, they brought them to us and only gave two tips for one and one tip for the others, although it was very evident we had 5 people with us. When we asked for more, tips, we were given the worse look, again making it seem like it was such a hassle.   Then we order 4 teas and 1 water bottle and again the waitress made us feel uncomfortable.   The sheesha is okay, not the worst, but the nargeela (the device you smoke it out of) is very cheap, the hose is very flimsy and made of plastic and kept coming out of the base.   There are much better places in the area."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Waited 10 minutes at the bar and still no service for us. If the bartender was busy I could understand but there were three people back there working and still no service. Waste of time. Waste of space. Highly suggest avoiding this dump!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a friend.   Most of the customers here were only here for the shisha, but my friend assured me that the food was great. The atmosphere is not fantastic, everyone was really casual, but the place looked like it was trying to be more upscale. Service was very good, quick and friendly.   We ordered the meat platter for 3, which comes with a chopped salad. Salad was fine, and the meat platter was good. It included a ground beef kebab, a chicken kebab, breaded chicken and chopped chicken on a bed of rice. I loved the rice! It kind of had the feel of sticky rice, but longer grain and with a nice, light flavour. The chicken was all cooked perfectly, as was the beef. It's supposed to be for three people, but the two of us killed it.   I'd come back again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"This place is a gem tucked away in a small strip plaza in North York. The food and shisha is great and inexpensive for the high quality you receive.  I would recommend anyone in the area stop by as it is a very relaxing place to spend an eveing with great good and hooka."}
{"text":"One of the oldest shisha spots in Toronto. They have their regulars and its always filled with 4-5 tables. Their prices are very cheap and their shisha and food are not bad. They have alcohol as well."}
{"text":"Horrible decor, the food took forever to get out, however the food was good, cheap and the shisha was cheap. Don't mind it but wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"This place was alright. Shisha was somewhat on par. We ended up there because the other place next doors was closed.   Service was a little slow. We ordered some tea, they forgot. So we ordered it again. It arrived right before we were about to leave. Upon the payment the person was inlcining towards charging us for two teapots. Unnecessary when you only served one to begin with.   Their greek salad was good though. Tasted good. But some olives and olive oil would have made it a bit more Greek Salad"}
{"text":"I went with a group of girlfriend 7 of us all together. We got there around 8:45 pm and were only greeted with \"that booth is reserved\" so we kindly moved to another area. At the time, there was one employee and maybe 12-17 people inside already sitting and enjoying themselves. She didn't seem to happy to be there. She didn't acknowledge or even smile.   The service is ridiculously slow!  I'm not sure if it was because the waitress found us intimidating or something else but she never came to our table. They didn't have the flavours we actually wanted so we ended up picked other. It took the waitress 30 minutes to bring the pipes. We got our own menus from the bar, wrote our food and drink orders on a pice of paper, then gave it to her. & proceeded to wait 40 minutes for the food to arrive.   By that time, a new waiter had come in to help the waitress and food and service got better. Not the best, but better. Even our waitress from earlier was nicer.   The atmosphere is pretty chill.  Lots of spaces, with plenty of seats. A big tv to keep you instead. The food is pretty good too. We'll probably go again if we have nothing better to do."}
{"text":"Ordered via just-eat and I was a very happy customer. Food was delivered fresh & hot!! I would order again!!!"}
