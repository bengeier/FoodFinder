{"text":"If you like Taiwanese food or just a fan of chicken, Koo Koo Chicken is for you.

I got the chicken bites with fries and a taro bubbletea. The food is incredibly well-seasoned and filled with flavor, the chicken is tender and not too overcooked. I love the variety of topping spices they have (seaweed, black pepper, spicy, lemon, etc) that go really well with the chicken and fries. This is a new favourite for me anytime I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Maybe it would be a better experience if I didn't come in with an expectation of tasting authentic Taiwanese food. We ordered chicken steak rice with bubble tea, steamed pork blood rice cake, and side dish appetizer.  They added too much sauce on every dish, and some sauce didn't even match the dish. The fried chicken was average. The bubble tea was way too sweet. The service was good though, and they did have plum power for the chicken which I have been craving for."}
{"text":"The KooKoo bites are the best! top it off with all the chili powder goodness, and wash it down with a cold tofu flower dessert!"}
{"text":"I come here really often but today this is by far my worst dining experience. We ordered a chicken rice combo with a warm soy milk tea and a Taiwan need noodles. For a restaurant with 3 tables, it's extremely fascinating that it took 20 minutes for the noodles, and over 40 minutes for the tea, just to serve it in ice. Extremely disappointed with the staff, clearly not the same as the usual staff. Will give it one more try, if this happens again. I would be sad to know that I have to give up on one of my goto place."}
{"text":"Mmm... 

I've been to Koo Koo's quite a few times now. I've tried the chicken steak combo, Koo Koo bites on rice, the oyster omelette, and the Taiwanese sesame oil chicken soup with vermicelli. They recently changed the menu a bit, and I noticed that they took out the pork on rice with thick soup (don't worry, it wasn't good anyway). 

My go-to is definitely the Koo Koo bites on rice! It comes with bite-sized fried chicken and a bowl of rice topped with minced pork belly, plus two little veggie dishes, and a couple slices of orange. The amount of spices in the fried chicken batter is just right. You can even add more flavour to your fried chicken, fries, rice, etc. with the seasonings available at each table. My favourite is the seaweed seasoning...on everything!

The taro slush is all right, but I am not a big fan of the other drinks. I have also tried the tofu dessert, and it was interestingly prepared in a sealed bubble tea cup. It was my first time sipping tofu out of a straw...

Koo Koo's can get a bit noisy and crowded, and it has always been a full house every time I visited. But the ordering system is quick and simple, and the tables are cleaned once guests leave. 

Expect to wait about 20 minutes for your fried chicken steaks though, but hey! It's fried to order, so it's always HOT and CRISPY when it arrives at your table. :)"}
{"text":"The customer service here is awesome! They were very patient with me while I was deciding what to order... Which seems to be a big problem with me :) 

The mango smoothie here is to die for! I think they use a combination of real mangos and the mango flavouring. The ratio they use is amazing since the real mango flavour is there and its not overwhelmed with sweetness.

The mini koo koo chicken bites are the best thing I ever had in Canada. The flavour reminds me of Taiwan's night markets but much cleaner and obviously more expensive since it's not in Asia. 

The chicken steak is almost identical to the ones in Taiwan's night markets too. 

Tl;Dr: customer service , check. Mango smoothie is awesome! Chicken steak and bites taste like authentic Taiwanese night market food!"}
{"text":"Tastes great!! Opens late.. Portions are great, 6 seasonings to make me happy, add more and I give 5 star, lol!!"}
{"text":"Kookoo chicken mini bites taste ok, not too salty and very fresh. On the other hand, the side dishes are awful!! 
Pork Sandwiches are a little bit too sweet. 
Don't recommend grass jelly in the drinks too since the texture tastes kinda strange and chemical, or maybe they just didn't make it very well. 
Also, the portion of the sausages is really small, 2 over-cooked and very short sausages cost almost $5 before tax. 
Not going back."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this review is more for the service than the food. When I went in, everyone had a poker face on. They looked like they did not wanna be there. I can understand it's a Friday afternoon and you wanna go home and hang with ur friends, but hey, who doesn't?  I ordered something to go, they didn't even bother waiting for me to pick it up, instead they put the order on the counter and walked away. Some service there! For all I know that could someone else's order. Thank goodness there was only me waiting. Would not back again."}
{"text":"HUGE disappointment. We had high hopes coming here after reading the reviews for this place most of which are four or five stars. Turns out the slams were more accurate. We ordered the chicken fried steak and mini KooKoo bites (basically popcorn chicken),which came out to about $25. Visually both lookedpretty good, but that's where the praise stops. The steaks and nuggets were utterly tasteless and uninspiring. There was no flavour, no dipping sauce, no nothing. We tried a few of the different powdery condiments which were all pretty gross variations of different salty flavours (e.g., lemon, plum). The accompanying fries were straight from the freezer, tasteless and like biting into a hollow cardboard stick. Everything was so bad we only finished about half of the food, which then sat on our stomachs like a ton of bricks for the rest of the afternoon.

The condiment stand on our table with the ketchup bottle and powder shakers was also seriously gross. The shakers were all sticky and dirty, but the ketchup bottle on our table was particularly nasty. I used a napkin to pick it up and could still feel I could still feel a sticky layer of dark gunk on the front of the bottle. Rather than buy new bottles of ketchup this place would rather saver a few bucks by continuing to fill up the same old disgusting bottle.

The bubble tea that came with each combo was decent, but that's about the only good thing I can say because we'd never be KooKoo enough to set foot in this place again."}
{"text":"Good Taiwanese food. I used to drive over to Papa Chang's from Mississauga but with Koo Koo Chicken, less so. Their menu is not as comprehensive as Papa Chang's though quality is comparable. I like their small intestine noodle soup. And their pork sandwich. Their bubble tea is good as well. They don't take credit card unlike Papa Chang's. They have more seating though."}
{"text":"Strangest place to find such an awesome Taiwanese fried chicken place. pork belly buns are a must have, fried chicken steak is also best thing ever."}
{"text":"It is dreadful... I got the chicken bites with rice and a original milk tea. First of all the milk tea tastes way too sweet and soapy. I can deal with sweet but I don't think it is supposed to taste soapy. I only had a few sips of that.

The chicken and rice came with side dishes. The side dishes are ok. The chicken bites were bland. I do not eat salty stuff regularly so for me to say it is bland, it would have been super bland. Even though it is pretty difficult to screw up rice, it wasn't served hot.

Portion was small. Had I gone to scarborough or Markham I would have gotten twice the portion for the same price. 

The only good thing was the orange."}
{"text":"I've never dine here but I love their chicken! Apart from chickens, they serve a few other selections in their menu, just don't expect anything fancy as this is just a typical Asian fast food place. Service is pretty adequate I'd say. So if you're looking for alternatives other than KFC or Mary Brown's, I recommend checking this place out although if you're looking to save a bit more, KFC offers cheaper (chicken) bucket meals and the fact they offer seasonal (online) coupons. The place is small and quite narrow but it's clean and organized. Apart from their signature chicken dish, they have bubble teas in several flavours to boot with."}
{"text":"Meh. It was okay. Not great. 

We shared the Koo Koo Chicken Bites, the Beef Noodle Soup and the Taiwanese Appetizer Plate.  

Taiwanese Appetizer Plate consisted of boiled peanuts, Pork Intestine, and Fish Cake/Sausage.  The peanuts were okay, pretty bland really, but that's boiled peanuts for you.  The Fish Cake/Sausage was not what I was expecting, as the photo on the menu, and other photos on Yelp led me to believe that it would be some sort of pork-based or blood sausage.  That was not the case. Generic, obviously not made in house, fish cake for us instead.  The Pork intestines were really horrendous - super strong porky flavour.  I guess I much prefer beef intestines, as the strong flavour really grossed me out.  Everything on the plate was blanketed in a sweet sauce.  

Beef noodle soup was okay: beef was well-braised, noodles were decent, broth a little spicy and a little sweet (I think tomato was used in the broth?), baby bok choy was overcooked.  

Chicken bites were okay - dredged in a light coating of corn starch and some seasoning and spices.  Dark meat, which is always my preference.  Not extremely flavourful, but you had the option to kick up the flavour with your choice of powders you could dust on top of the chicken.  My dining companion and myself both preferred the curry powder out of all the options, most of which we found pretty bland and uninteresting.  

Drinks were decent - I had the Lemon Honey drink with Chia Seeds and Grass Jelly, which I quite enjoyed - slimy and chewy in the most delicious way!  

Atmosphere is cafeteria-like, with the unusual choice of thick deep red wall-to-wall carpeting on floor.  You order at the counter, and they bring the food to you.  Service was barely attentive, and certainly not very friendly.  

Overall impression?  I will not return.  There are surely better options for Taiwanese cuisine out there.  Oh, and unless you like things that taste like the rear end of a pig, avoid the Taiwanese Appetizer Plate (we nicknamed the rolled and braised intestines Piggy Piggy Bunghole).  I would have like to have tried a few more of the other dishes to provide a more comprehensive review, but for now, I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Really good fried chicken. The chicken is like nothing Ive tried before. As they are chicken steaks, the meat is nice and moist. They have other hk style items on the menu, but nothing can touch the chicken."}
{"text":"I will only speak only the fried chicken, as that's all I have had. 
Hidden gem. Sandwich, chicken steak and Koo Koo bites. All good. 
And the fact that you can get a bubble tea with your combo, even better!"}
{"text":"Big crunchy juicy fried chicken,  best I've had around so far.  Prices are fair,  a little slow to cook so its best to call ahead.
Store is very dirty. 

edit: their prices have gone up and chicken it exceptionally smaller in size.  Still tastes great..."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is very good because it is made to order. It is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. All of the seasoning flavors offered at the table is awesome. The bubble tea is sweet and refreshing. Only complaint is the price a little too high for what it is."}
{"text":"Really, really good fried chicken.  Mini Koo Koo bites were better than the steak probably because it was all dark meat.  Plus I think there was a bit of curry seasoning on there.  Light and crispy, I'd rather eat these watching a movie than popcorn!  

We ordered the rice bowl with pork as well and it was super tiny.   Very tasty but very small.  On the other hand the chicken steak was very large!  So sharing between the two was about right.   

Nix the strawberry shake....next time we'll do milk tea. 

The rice dish took no time but the fried goodies took about 15-20 mins.  Next time we'll call ahead for takeout."}
{"text":"We always order the chicken skin, Taiwanese lemonade and the tofu pudding. The prices are reasonable and the portions are very very very generous."}
{"text":"Expensive but pretty good if you're craving fried chicken. Their seasoning is different from any other bubble tea place for chicken"}
{"text":"price is relatively high, overall is fine"}
{"text":"Friendly attentive staff. THE MOST DELICIOUS CHICKEN IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE! The restaurant itself is a little basic and sterile and blah looking (clean though) but really who gives a single care when the chicken is this good??? My 4 year old talks about it all the time. He also contends it is the best CHICKEN IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE."}
{"text":"Had their chicken thigh and leg combo today for $10.25. Where do I begin? First off, the chicken looked like it was in mutant form...definitely not ontario grade quality. The batter was very bland and had no flavour whatsoever. Judging from the positive yelp reviews, I thought I was in for a treat - not a science experiment taste test. One yelper said the chicken was on par with popeyes or kfc....dude - you are definitely as kookoo as the chicken and the same goes for the rest of you. May the flavour gods be with your taste buds.

This was pure highway robbery - definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews and fiending for Taiwanese fried chicken, I dragged my boyfriend here on a Monday night and I'm very happy to say that we both left completely satiated and impressed! 

The place was really clean (although, the decor was quite quirky - visit and you'll see what I mean lol!) and the service was friendly and accommodating. 

We ordered two chicken steak meals that came with a huge portion of beautifully fresh fried chicken steak, fries & a bubble tea. We also got the pork buns which were amazing! 

The buns were the perfect texture and the filling was so flavourful and delicious. The chicken steak felt incredibly fresh, the meat was white meat, the batter was crispy and flavourful, and it wasn't dry at all! They offer little shakers filled with different kinds of flavour seasonings at every table. We used spicy and curry - it was fantastic! 

My boyfriend ADORED the bubble tea and he normally isn't even a fan of it. We got the original tea and he drank all of his and proceeded to drink half of mine! 

All in all, we had no complaints and have already started planning our next visit! Great experience and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Interesting concept, I really liked having the different powdered flavourings on the table to season my food. (Try \"seaweed\" on your fries!) I had gotten the chicken fried steak and it was a basket of maybe about 4 pieces of chicken. It was alright, the portions were huge but the flavour was just OK and actually was a bit dry. I didn't feel like it an amazing flavour but rather, it was just normal fried chicken. Kind of defeats the purpose of going to a place that specializes in deep fried chicken if my meal wasn't the highlight. Since I had ordered the combo, I got the milk tea with tapioca and Chia seeds. Probably a bad idea since the Chia seeds were not mixed properly and were all goopy, stuck together and tasteless as if they've been soaking all day. I think out of the entire meal, the French fries were by far the best part of my meal. All in all, not sure that I'd return. There are other places that I'd much rather eat fried chicken at."}
{"text":"Service is bad. Normally, Taiwanese service is pretty good, but the Chinaman (i.e. not Taiwanese) behind the counter was mildly rude. He even told us what table to sit at - whaaat?!?! I thought it was self-serve.

Ordered pork sandwiches, chicken bits and bubble tea. Pork sandwiches were decent, although I've had better. Chicken bits were okay, but again, have had better. The bubble tea was downright gross; the tea flavor was hardly present and the milkiness tasted more artificial than anything else. But hey, the tapioca was done exactly right!

Come here if you're craving Taiwanese food, but don't care that it's just okay."}
{"text":"My favorite Taiwanese place in Mississauga! Delicious Taiwanese popcorn chicken and other small eats. Good quantity for reasonable prices. I liked their mini koo koo chicken bites $4.40, Taiwanese pork sandwiches $6.50 for 2,  soy ginger chicken with basil on rice $7.95, which came with some sides. Very tasty and filling. Casual environment, which is great since no tip and quick for eating. 

Bubble tea was a bit disappointing however. Better off having it at Chatime or Bubble Republic. This is the place to go for Taiwanese and will definitely leave impressed."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 star

Okay so finally tried KOOKOO chicken. 
It was pretty delish! My favourite dish was the signature koo koo chicken and Taiwanese beef noodles. The KOOKOO chicken was lightly battered and well fried. I liked that the chicken pieces were real meat. The Taiwanese beef noodle had great flavour and I liked the noodle they used. It was fresh and had that chewy consistency I love for noodles. 

My fiancé ordered the chicken steak, it had a different taste from the other fried chicken. 
I liked that they had powdered flavours like curry, lemon, chicken spice for you to put on your chicken to flavour it. Otherwise it would be quite bland. 

The portions were giant, I could barely eat what I ordered. Especially considering its fried chicken. 

The price was decent. And comparable the kfc. But some items were kind of overpriced and under delivering. The tofu pudding for example was 5.00 for a bowl. And when it came to the table it was all piecey. Traditional tofu pudding dessert should be served in giant chunks. 

The service I found was good too. Considering you order first and then sit. Everyone was patient and nice. 

Will I come back again? Not right away but down the road? Sure!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews on Yelp, I had to check this place out. They are still relatively new, opened about 10 months ago. When me and my friends arrived, we were politely seated and given take-out menus since it was our first time here. 

This place is known for their chicken so I had to try it. I ordered combo 1 which is the chicken steak combo that comes with fries and a bubble tea for $9.95, awesome! The chicken is good! It was on par with KFC and Popeyes, maybe even better! The seasoning was different in a good way, I'm assuming it was because of special Taiwanese spices. The fries were pretty good and the bubble tea was not powder so that's a plus. If you don't like eating plain, there are a variety of condiments available for you to add to your meal. 

Overall, this place is pretty good! The staff are friendly and I'm surprised about how good the chicken is. NOTE: this place is pretty small so I don't recommend coming in large groups; I believe it's more of a take-out place. Also, they take DEBIT/CASH only."}
{"text":"I am Taiwanese and I LOVE Taiwanese style fried chicken.  I went there after reading the reviews here.  I was not disappointed.  Let's just say my expectation was quite low when I arrived because the decor is VERY cheap and old.  Their sign doesn't show \"Taiwanese Fried Chicken\" in either Mandarin or English.  Nobody knows what \"Koo Koo\" means.  If I didn't read the review here, I would not have gone in just by passing by the store.   

Ok.  That's the BAD part.  

The GOOD part.  I like the menu.  I've always wanted a Taiwanese version of KFC.  Their fried chicken fillet is very good.  Juicy and pretty big portion if you get Combo 1.  I LOVE the drink selection.  It's not the typical pop drinks or the simple green/black tea.  They have \"Frog Egg\" drink which sounds gross but it's not.  It's some kind of jelly.  It reminds me of Taiwan!  

My brother ordered their Steamed Chicken rice which is surprisingly tender but a bit under cooked.  lol   

I would definitely go back again if it's closer to me.  I live in Toronto.  Next time I want to try their Chicken Bites/Ball rice.  Honestly, if this place spends more time on decor and improves their bubble tea menu, they can easily attract more teenagers to hang out there.

PS:  Another place to get good Taiwanese style Fried Chicken Ball is Zen Q on Yonge street.  Another great cheap place to eat and you get a bubble tea drink too for $9.95."}
{"text":"One the worse experience I've ever had ordering food from a restaurant.
Oyster omelet was cold, hard, sandy and had a very bad odor to it. At first glance It almost looked like a pile of scrambled eggs.
Taiwanese vermicelli was very bland and had chunks of some sort of gelatin. As if they reheated left over food from the day before.
Fried chicken skin was dry and stale.
Overall i wouldn't recommend anyone trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"It costs me exactly twenty-five Canadian dollars in gas money to travel from my house in Toronto to this this Mississauga neighbourhood. So far, I've done this twice, which equates to roughly one hundred dollars just to eat fried chicken. 

Koo Koo Chicken. This is what a fried chicken restaurant is supposed to be. Contemporary Chinese cuisine, and when I say 'contemporary', I mean bubble tea with Eastern renditions of Western food. This is food from the Taiwan region, and it makes me want to visit Taiwan ever more. 

My friends Kathy and Alex live just around the block, and although I like the say that I use this restaurant to see them, the truth is more like I use them as an excuse to eat at this restaurant. I make it a point to arrive before the usual meal hours, as patrons pour into here like a torrential rain, just like how it rains in Taiwan. 
The staff are so friendly, and they will bring the food to your table when you chose to dine in. The menu is perfect portioned with options to satisfy most chicken cravings, and the prices are just around the margin where my cheapness still decides to tip generously. The clean ambiance resonates throughout the floor, to the kitchen, and the spacious washrooms. No effort effort went into the ambiance, and that's just as well because with food this good, who honestly cares? It's fried chicken for God Sakes.

The chicken steaks are large stripes of white meat fried lightly, served on top of a serving of crispy fries, and comes with a medium sized drink, as all combos do. There is a noodle bowl, pork belly with rice, and if you really want to indulge; a unapologetic basket of fried chicken skins. Try explaining that one to your doctor. 
For me, the crowning dish are the gigantic, Jurassic sized chicken thighs, in a light, but flavourful batter which I have time and time again failed to duplicate at home. Two glorious pieces of bird that had me picking through as if I was at home, alone, not wearing pants. I think one can come here dressed just as mentioned, and nobody would give a damn. Everybody here is entrenched in their dish of deep fried, heavily spiced dish of guilt, that quite frankly; the cute women who frequent here have all escape my attention. It's not the type of chicks I'm interested in when I am here, and I don't think anyone else could argue.

It takes some time for the food to arrive, and despite knowing that my food the prepared fresh, this is one aspect where I find annoying, and should be improved upon. When it gets busy, you'd think that they're in the back, waiting for the egg to hatch or something. The fact that is place hasn't franchised into Toronto is a frustration which keeps me turning in my bed at night, and keep my kitchen splattered in the oils of failure and contempt. 

I am certainly koo koo for chicken, but unless my psychiatrist can prescribe batter, she shall never know this."}
{"text":"The fried chicken here is amazing!! I love the little spice packets you get with the chicken. Its practically the Asian version of KFC and it is amazing. The chicken is very tender and definitely not as greasy as KFC. Also, the bubble tea here is probably the best I've ever had. Their Taro Bubble Tea surpasses the one a TenRen and is cheaper too!

edited: ive come in here multiple times since my first review (originally 5 stars) lately the service is very slow and the food is sometimes slightly undercooked"}
{"text":"This is like infusing KFC with Papa Chang lol .. fried chicken so good but also with bubble tea and Taiwanese specialties like ??? ($4.99 side, $8.99 w/ rice) and??? oyster omelette ($10.50)! 

Well done food with side spices for you to customize. I had #7 ??? mini koo koo bite combo $8.50, grass jelly milk tea (medium $.75), ???? taiwanese vermicelli $6.80 and a side of Kala chicken thigh $3.50. Pretty satisfied! The vermicelli was surprisingly soft but the intestines aren't as strong of a flavor as it should. 

Order at the cash and just seat yourself. Definitely give them a try if you're in town and craving for some crunch :)

{"text":"Just ate here. Walked in and it was very busy. Read yelp reviews and was dying to check it out. I was alone so decided to order it to go.

Ordered the pork belly buns, KooKoo chicken bites and the fries.



Chicken bites: perfectly crispy, juicy, and real dark meat. Very tasty..I put some of the chicken seasoning on the chicken..it tasted like the flavour packets you get in ramen noodles..heavy on the white pepper so it has a distinct taste, also a hint of curry..I'll be honest..I wasn't crazy about the seasoning personally, but I could see others enjoying it very much.

Pork belly bao buns: ehh..pork belly was kinda dry, personally thought there were tooo many crushed peanuts on it so it masked the taste of everything else..the bao buns got stuck to the paper they serve it to you on..the pickles veggies were completely lost ..

Fries: the best part. Crispy, light, perfectly seasoned. I doused them in sriracha/ hot sauce 

Over all I found my meal to be slightly dry, but this is all personal taste..I would love if they had more sauces to dip all the chicken in..although they may not traditionally do this in Taiwan so it's all subjective..the food was a great effort, it was extremely fresh, and yes I would encourage anyone to try it out at least once ..

Would definitely come back again and try the fried chicken, and some of the more traditional Taiwanese dishes."}
{"text":"I came here a year ago and the chicken was very good a recently went back on an off peak day and the chicken didn't taste as fresh. The bbt and chicken combination is a unique twist and add in your own powdery condiments such as lemon, plum and seaweed does in fact help enhance the flavor of the fried chicken. I love fried chicken and this place was good but I may have gone on an off day where the chicken tasted a bit old and plausibly refried."}
{"text":"At first glance, it looks much like your typical Asian bubble tea locale with the ikea furniture and oddly coloured paint job. It is actually more of a pop eyes/KFC chicken type place once you get in and see the menu.  I found this place via an insauga article about fried chicken places, and decided to try it out.  I had combo #1, the chicken steak (chicken breast) with fries and a drink. The various spices on the table me the chicken quite taste! The fried chicken was quite good, and did not mess with my stomach as KFC, etc usually does. The fries were also well done. I drank a Fanta, but a buddy of mine got the bubble tea in place of a pop and commented that same was quite good. While the food was good and cheap, what set this place apart from most bubble tea places, etc was that it was actually clean!  Usually these places are dingy and dirty, but this place was not.  The bathrooms were clean, and had sufficient soap and paper towels, which is important when you need to wash your hands after eating fried chicken. Will be going back for more chicken."}
{"text":"Love the chicken here. Chicken steak, chicken burger, chicken bites. All are great and their bubble tea is worth a try, nice simple taiwanese black milk tea. Menu is really small but to me that's always welcome as a sign of great execution of the food. 

Do not let the bland interior of this place food you, you'd definitely be missing out."}
{"text":"If you've ever sat at a KFC and thought that a bubble tea would work, then this is the restaurant for you. Chicken is crispy and flavourful. Koo Koo even sells chicken skins, the part that your mother tells you not to eat because it's too fatty. They aren't going to win any healthy restaurant awards, but you're not expecting them to. 

The tea is good too, acting as a nice refreshment after you've devoured a huge amount of grease. Prices aren't bad either."}
{"text":"Wow!  my fellow Yelpers really like this place? I am very surprised, I walked in when they had just opened and ordered their fried chicken by itself , they sprinkle some house salt  and black pepper on the chicken..it was too salty and not much flavor...

after I finished my food, the guy at counter asked \"how it was:\"? i was being polite so  I said it was good but little too salty for my taste, the guy kind of chuckled like i had no clue what i was talking about

I will never go back..

thanks for reading"}
{"text":"Only Taiwanese chicken place in Mississauga. Had a variety of different flavoring shakes and got a chance to try them all! Chicken was not as flavourful as I would like. Would go back again if I was craving some Taiwanese chicken :)"}

Very disappointed with the food and will not be coming back."}

The food takes a bit longer compared to other fastfood restaurant but it's really fresh and I've been a regular customer since they opened!"}
{"text":"This may be the best Taiwanese chicken that I've had. The \"steak\" consists of juicy pieces of breast with a great batter. 

Got the family combo which comes with 4 chicken steaks, 2 fries and 2 drinks for just over $30. It's a lot of food! Fries were average but as mentioned the chicken was great and I liked my taro drink too. It was good that they have several different seasonings for the fries (eg curry, lemon, seaweed, etc). 

Some of the dishes did seem expensive though. For example, the beef noodle soup is over $10. This is a couple of bucks higher than I've seen it at all other places.

Accepts debit or cash. Large parking lot available (same plaza as No Frills)"}
{"text":"Driving all the way to Mississauga for fried chicken?  Some would say this was a pretty dumb idea.  But let me tell you, it sure beats a flight to Taiwan.

They've got different types of fried chicken:  large legs and thighs, flattened cutlets, and popcorn-style.  Combos come with fries and a specialty drink.  They offer noodle and rice dishes too.  Very tasty food.  

This is an authentic Taiwan-styled fried chicken joint.  We enjoyed our meal a lot.  Maybe it would be a better idea to make it a day trip instead of a one meal trip."}
{"text":"Koo Koo Chicken is a very random little Taiwanese chicken joint in a dead plaza located at the outskirts of Mississauga.  

But that doesn't mean their chicken isn't downright delicious. 

I'm not sure where to place Koo Koo chicken in the spectrum of restaurants. They're not quite fast food because their menu doesn't cater to high volume party purchases like KFC or Popeyes. Yet they aren't quite a typical restaurant either, as they don't actually provide servers for water, napkins or utensils. If you've ever been to Asia, Koo Koo Chicken's model is very similar to their Cafe de Coral's franchise. Expect a very casual eating environment, so I don't recommend bringing a first date here or something. (Unless you're below the age of 17, then go for it buddy!) 

Koo Koo Chicken's menu comprises of three main combo offerings:

1) Chicken steak
2) Chicken leg and thigh 
3) Popcorn chicken (koo koo chicken bites)

(Note: They also offer pork sandwiches, chicken sandwiches, chicken with rice and non-combo options)

I ordered the chicken leg and thigh combo. All combos comes with fries and a drink. The fries were very average, but each table at Koo Koo Chicken provides a selection of seasoning (curry, lemon, pepper, seaweed, spicy, plum) at the table that provides a nice and fun way to add flavour to your fries. I also got their Taiwanese lemonade drink, which was pretty good and helps with the saltiness of the fries and chicken. 

Now about the chicken: It's friggen delicious. Fried chicken is BEST when it is freshly fried. The pieces I had were fresh from the deep fryer, and so it was very crispy and very juicy. Maybe it was just my luck that day, but I found that my drumstick piece was enormous. The flavour is very tasty and is much better than your typical Popeyes or KFC. 

As a tip and warning, I also tried their popcorn chicken and it was a disappointment. Many bubble tea places offer popcorn chicken, and I expected a real fried chicken establishment to exceed popcorn chicken from a bubble tea place but it didn't. I do not recommend the popcorn chicken. 

The price of Koo Koo is very reasonable. You're looking at $10-11 for a combo, and there's no tips expected by the establishment. 
 
Come here for a tasty, inexpensive, non-formal meal between friends."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong?  Fried chicken and bubble tea in the same place!  I went today and there was a 2 for 1 special on the bubble tea.  I got a chicken combo that included 5 chicken fried steaks, 1 leg, 1 thigh and fries.  The chicken legs and thighs come in spicy or regular.  The chicken steak is literally as big as your face.  It is meaty, juicy and crispy.  There is also a bunch of flavours of seasoning shakers and spicy sauce to try on your chicken steak .  I think the fried chicken is very good and a good alternative to Popeyes or KFC.  Bubble tea is done well and pearls are fresh.  Would feel less guilty if they had a nice veg side choice to come with a combo.  Good casual concept with nice eating area and such great value.  Staff are super friendly."}
{"text":"Om nom nom. This place is so good for when you want to indulge in your greasy chicken urges and don't feel like KFC. I can't quite put my finger on it, but Taiwanese fried chicken has a different taste and crunch that makes my mouth water just thinking about.

This place is magic, and they know it. They don't open until 4pm, and there's already a slew of people coming in at that time grabbing take out for dinner or an afternoon snack. I came in looking to try their wares, and was overwhelmed by the options. It's not intuitive how the combos work, so take some time to study the menus before making your way up to the front.

Note that for their combos, you can get bubble tea as your drink. I mean seriously, bubble tea. As a drink option. This place is amazing.

The chicken is fantastic, as is the chicken popcorn. The portion is so generous, I could barely touch the fries. Which is okay, since the fries didn't seem anything special to me. 

I would most definitely come back here again for more take out. The food is so good, and the combo is totally worth it. If you're looking for an alternative to your fried chicken options, this is it!"}
{"text":"terrible experience. food is way too salty. service is terrible. I waited 30 mins for my drink and expected a NO sugar drink since I orderedd so, when I saw the server serbing multiple same.drinks to different tables I knew she was gonna mess it up. So I double checked with her and she insist its no sugar. Guess what, when I tried it, its like has more sugar than coke."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place from a few friends who have all enjoyed it. The thought of bubble tea and fried chicken is an odd yet new idea, so i had to see what the hype was about.

As soon as we entered, the place seemed clean and surprisingly did not strongly smell after fried chicken (I mean it in a good way). Not to my surprise, they were playing some slow Asian music, and randomly My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion...which felt weird. I feel like they need to play more upbeat songs instead of romantic/slow songs. They also had the music pretty loud - I believe music in any restaurant should be noise in the background that fills up silence, not almost drown out the people you try to talk to.

As for the food, it was about a 10-15 minute wait for us before having our full meal (we both ordered the two piece combo). First came out our drinks; I had the Taiwanese Lemonade with Aiyu Jelly after heard good things about it from a friend. I found this drink very freshening and delightful - would definitely have this again if i come back. We then had our fries delivered. There was ketchup, hot sauce, and some powder toppings from curry, spice, black pepper and seaweed to add on top to add flavor. I like how they provide a variety of toppings you can add yourself to your food (bonus points there). The fries tasted fresh and were delivered quickly which was good because it kept us busy till the main course arrived. We both had a leg and a thigh. The chicken was just like KFC/Popeyes, but was more tender which my girlfriend liked. I didn't feel as bad eating it through compared to other fried chicken joints, which was a good thing - maybe it's another reason to come back. ;)

Overall Koo Koo Chicken was delightful. If I ever end up craving fried chicken, I'd likely choose here instead of KFC or Popeyes. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss with service, and quality. It's worth a try since this style of fried chicken is unique in the area -- a lot of different shakers of spices to season to your liking."}
{"text":"I have been Koo Koo Chicken twice. It is located at a plaza with plenty of parking space, so no problem there. The place is like a self serve fast food restaurant. Place your order at the counter, and wait for your food at the table. The chicken meals are nothing special. However, I love their pork belly buns. The pork belly is tender and taste just right. With sour cabbage and crushed peanuts, it is really yummy. It makes a good lunch meal in my option."}
{"text":"The decor is pretty tacky but who cares!  Their food is amazing!  Finally some good Taiwanese food in Mississauga!  Their chicken is always made fresh, if you order fried chicken, you are told to wait 20 mins.  Their rice dish and baos are also very delicious!  This place is gonna become a regular for me."}
{"text":"Mango BBT and Beef Noodle Soup: Authentic, cheap, and perfect for the crazy minus weather. Chicken bites were good, definitely not as oily as Popeyes, and a great kick if you add the spicy seasoning to it. I took my parents here, and they were so impressed by the beef noodles so that's gotta say something. BBT is another guilty pleasure of mines, If the tapioca's aren't soft I wont ever order again. The mango bbt was perfection, fresh and not too sweet, with soft tapoica's that melt in your mouth. Downside is that they only open 6 hrs Mon-Thurs (4-10)."}
{"text":"My experience with Asian-style western food has been mixed, from: the bad (attempt at Italian food), the okay (Malaysian snack burgers), to delicious (bakery). For purely anthropological purposes of exploration and understanding, I had to try the Taiwanese take on southern fried chicken.

Inside is nice, open, and colourful. Another reviewer mentioned that aspects of it are kitschy with non-nonsensical sayings on the wall. It kind've adds to the experience however.

I was doing takeout, and the overhead menu only shows a few items - though there were clearly other more Taiwanese dishes on the tables. The combos are around $10-11, which puts it a couple bucks more than their spiritual father - the Colonel. However, it comes with a choice of around a dozen bubble teas. Moreover, the quality of the chicken - as I was about to find out, was superior.

As others have said, they're made to order; so expect to wait at least 15 minutes. However, I asked and a sever confirmed that one can call ahead. Duly noted for the future. Nice service too, I should add.

The order arrived and by the heat of the bag, it was apparent that this had been in the fryer only 30 Mississippi's earlier. They said they don't have a spicy variety, but they do provide two containers upon request. One is a salt/pepper mix, and the other is a chilli power. I threw some in the bag, and *shake shake shake*, I have spicy chicken.

I ordered the chicken 'steak', which is a nice sized breast (get your mind out of the gutter) diced into a few pieces. The colour of the battered skin is noticeably different from typical fried chicken. It's almost a greyish-white and you can see the seasoning. It's different, but it's not off-putting either. Chicken was cooked to a perfect level and still juicy. The oil was at the right temperature since the grease wasn't sponged in. There was a unique taste and seasoning that emerged. It's killing me that I can't identify it, but I'm sure you'll taste it if you try it. Fries were fairly average.

Tasty chicken, and will certainly come back (and call ahead) when in the area."}
{"text":"Today was my third time coming here. The chicken steak portions are huge! Make sure to use the flavour powders when you're eating this. The chicken itself is flavourful and crispy. Their fries aren't anything special. It's reminiscent of McCain fries. Their black milk tea is pretty good and they have really soft tapioca.

I tried the Chicken Steak on rice today and it was delicious - it's basically chicken breast deep fried with sweet chilli sauce. It came with white rice, a side of cabbage, one piece of deep fried tofu, and two slices of oranges.

Like the poster below me said, I agree that Koo Koo should consider adding a salad option to their menu. I'll be back to try the new pork sandwiches."}
{"text":"First time to come here as I got curious with its review in Yelp.
Staff is very nice. Place is small but well maintain and clean. We tried the chicken steak which is moist, big and you know its newly cooked. There are spices if you want to spike up the taste. Oyster omellette is huge! Its like pancake with bean sprout and other vegetables. Good for sharing. Their chicken soup taste like \"tinola\" of Philippines. Their milk tea is very good too."}
{"text":"This is a real gem in a very bland plaza. The signage isn't going to draw you in it might be hard to see from the road. But if you come here, I can guarantee you some good fried chicken.

I'm sure you've all tried fried chicken in one from or another. This is fried chicken with a Taiwanese twist. It's delicious and reasonably priced. And I really like drinking bubble tea with fried chicken. It somewhat negates that greasy feeling you get from eating fried chicken.

As a comparison, Koo Koo's chicken is made fresh. I presume this means they season and batter it in house. They have a sign that they take up to 20 mins to prepare, which in my opinion is well worth the wait. Whereas most franchises out there probably do it assembly line style. You can really taste the tenderness of the chicken. Best part of all is that it's relatively less greasy than KFC or Popeyes. 

Their batter isn't just batter. It's not quite as crispy as Popeyes but it's more savory. And the tables have various spices like lemon powder, curry, and even plum that you can add to your chicken/fries. 

The menu choices are excellent. They know many of the more \"traditional\" people don't like fried chicken so they have many Taiwanese dishes like 3 cups chicken and beef noodles. But of course, you want to come here for the chicken as that's what they specialize in. You can get individual pieces or get a combo which includes fries + bubble tea. 

Portion wise, the chicken steak is perfect. The #4 combo is worth it as it comes with 3 baskets of chicken steaks! It can possibly feed 3. They call it \"steak\" but actually a few pieces will have bones which is not a big deal for me. Just letting you know. 

I'd totally come again. In fact, I need to make an excuse to come here again. I've never had such fresh tasting fried chicken."}
{"text":"THE BUBBLE TEA WAS THE BOMBBBBBBB!

I had the taiwainese popcorn chicken it was okay, it could maybe use a little more time in the frier or double fry or use a lighter flour for crispier results, and a little more salt after being fried.

The prices are cheap great, the decor is okay could use some work on it. The place is clean and theres friendly staff. 

The only thing i dislike is the delivery is not working right now a JUSTeat, and the hours are hard to catch cause during weekdays theyre only open after 4pm and I get cravings before that time :c

Would come back again... For the bubble tea ofc."}
{"text":"Took a bit of time, but was worth the wait, real classic fried chicken, with fun Chinese sides and takes on signature dishes!"}
{"text":"I was intrigued about going to eat at Koo Koo because well... it's fried chicken.  The place is really different and if you're expecting a typical fast food place no this is not that kind of chain restaurant that you're probably used to.

While I take that into account I have to just take the food for what it is, unhealthy and delicious deep fried food. You have to get in line and order and then they bring it to your table.  

We had gone with the chicken skins (5 bucks) as well as 2 extra combos of a double chicken steak combo (for 2) and a single leg and thigh combo for one.  Combos are basically about 10 or 11 bucks per person which include the chicken, fries and drink.  I'm not a fan of bubble tea so I just went with a soy tea and a honey lemon with chia for the other.  We all had our teas without tapioca (bubbles).

We were 3 people dining so we shared the skins on a stick and each had our combos.  The chicken skin was really what it is but the crunch and taste does have an Asian twist to it.  The skin is bubbly looking almost like chicharone (pork rinds).  

The chicken steaks are basically white meat portions cut up into smaller pieces, batterered and fried.  Because the pieces are smaller say like a breast cut up there's more surface and thus more crispiness to it.  The oil must be very hot to get the chicken this crispy with the coating but there is a layer of grease that gathers at the bottom of the cardboard dish.  

This is definitely not the healthiest dining option but it's not supposed to be.  The food is good but I can't say I'm too convinced to want to come back.  It's sort of out of the way from where I live and while the food is good I can't say it's spectacular.  I'll give it a solid 3* though."}
{"text":"The chicken here is completely uncalled for.  I completely was not expecting this level of tasteyness.  They have shakers with certain flavored stuff for the chicken.  The drinks are pretty good too!

Food 5/5
Price 4/5
Convenience 5/5
Service 4/5"}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I have tried something so disappointing. We ordered the chicken steak with rice combo, Taiwanese appetizer, the oyster omelette, and a milk tea with herbal jelly. Most things were just okay... nothing special. 

First, let's talk about the worse part of the meal. The worse part is the Taiwanese appetizer. It is super super super sad. Firstly, we asked what comes in the appetizer. They told us: egg, sausage, and vermicelli. What came to the table instead is intestine, egg, and sausage. The intestine was super fat, not tasty, and smells. There was no way we could keep the dish. They changed the intestine to fish cake. However, that fish cake was super super oily. Furthermore, the egg looked very old and the sausage too.

After talking about the bad let's talk about the good. Very surprisingly, the milk tea with herbal jelly was yummy. The tea base was made really well and it wasn't too sweet without asking. As well, my friend ordered the honey lemon with chia seed which was really good. So I believe the best part of the restaurant are their drinks. 

Overall, I'm not sure how they got such a high rating. After trying this place once, sadly, I don't think I'll ever be back..."}
{"text":"Great chicken choice! Price and quality that are superb for the unwealthy :P...delicious solid pick....the chicken is only enhanced by the interesting choices of sprinkled on, table side seasonings. Everything to love and nothing to hate about the place except for the calories and lack of late night hours."}
{"text":"The best! The oyster omlette is a must try (beats every night market one), and the chicken is so good with the many spices available. Hope this place stays in Creditview for a very long time."}
{"text":"Smaller portion than I thought.And the herb is not real xiancao. Little bit disappointed. Fried chicken is good."}
{"text":"both the chicken bites and the chicken steak are wayyyy too bland. Pretty sure the thing is called \" salty chicken bites\" in Chinese for a reason, it's suppose to be savoury and I had to ask for salt from the kitchen to make adjustments... 

bubble tea is mediocre... won't be back"}
{"text":"Asian food + bubble tea + fried chicken = guility pleasure.  

I saw this place after having some pho at Pho Dau Bo on Creditview and Bristol and it was quite the surprise.  The first time I had their winter melon black tea with tapioca and it tasted like, get this, tea with wintermelon and tapioca.  It was a far cry from other bubble tea places which just tastes like sugar + water + powder.  They loaded it up tapioca and it was nice and chewy.  

I was so impressed by the bubble tea, I came here the next day to try out their fried chicken steak.  I got the combo which included 5-6 pcs of chicken steak, fries and bubble tea for $9.95.  This is a steal if you consider that bubble tea costs around $4.00, so you are paying less than $5 for the food.  The chicken is different from Popeye's and KFC, but it's just as crispy as Popeye's. It's nicely seasoned, crunchy, moist on the inside but with a semi sweet outer coating.  It was delicious.  The fries were okay, not great, but not bad either.  What I really liked was the extra seasoning they offer on the table, which includes seaweed spice, spicy seasoning, curry, black pepper and lemon seasoning.  

Verdict: Come here for a quick and cheap guility pleasure meal but also feel satisfied with your choices.  Food here is much better than other bubble tea places.

PS don't come here expecting fruit flavoured bubble tea. It's soy milk, winter melon, and original."}
{"text":"Bomb diggity fried chicken! Crispy and flavourful. Small cafe like joint in a run down plaza. Bubble tea was terrible. Wouldn't recommend the popcorn chicken unless you want to be mistaken for having halitosis."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been here a few times now and it has never let me down. It really has solidified itself as my go-to place for fried chicken that's relatively close to home.

I usually go for the leg/thigh combo which comes with a drink and fries. The milk tea is really sweet and I could do without it but I've had worse from establishments that actually specialize in bubble tea. They give a lot of fries considering that it's meant to be an individual portion and the chicken pieces are huge. What I'm trying to say is, the meal will fill you up! 

Chicken is fantastic. It seems like the steak and the leg/thighs are fried using a different batter. Both great and I highly recommend the mini koo koo bites if you prefer to keep your hands clean. Solid choices all around.

Don't be disappointed to see your food come out plain and unseasoned. You can get creative with the spices provided on the table such as curry, spicy, seaweed, plum powder, lemon and black pepper. 

I consider it to be a cheap eats but for those who don't, it's not overpriced and very much worth it!"}
{"text":"Very tender meat. Good bread on chicken. Not too salty.  Very good Taiwanese place and would recommend to my Taiwanese friends :) I had the popcorn chicken (dark meat) and chicken steak (white meat) - dark meat is better :) Also you get a variety of spices and seasoning that you can put on the chicken to flavour up your chicken :)"}
{"text":"WARNING.....RANT

I can't believe we just lost one of the best fried chicken joints in sauga. Maybe my post is a little bias but I did mean to write a good review on kookoo 2 yrs ago. From what I remembered the chicken was so good and the restaurant was operating smoothly.

I went on a sat night and it was a nightmare.

Let's start with ordering, it took a while to order food because there was a communication barrier with the cashier...and the rest of the staff. I think the menu is super confusing because there's no number for the combos on the big menu but if you look down on the ONE place mat at the cashier there are numbers for the menu combos. Just make NEW menus! 

Food: ordered 4 chicken wings and one 2-piece chicken combo, 2 lemonade with ayu jelly $30.The lemonade was super sweet from the last time I had it. I asked if they could make me a new one with half sweet. They put the blame on me for not ordering half sweet but they never asked me how I liked it! So they literally poked a hole in my drink and poured it into a larger cup and topped it off with more tea. Like it doesn't cost much to make a new one. 
When the wait was finally over, the fried chicken arrived! I was ecstatic! The chicken wings were huge but it just started to scare me a little. As we were on our first wing, my friend's chicken was pink in the middle (regret not taking a pic before they took it away). I asked the server if it was safe to eat and she's like I'm not sure and took the basket to the back....why she take it to the back instead of calling the manager? She comes back 5min later and said yeah you can eat it....or I can make a new one. Ofc I told her to make a new one, wasn't going to risk getting sick on a sat night and it was cold by then! As I was half way into my second wing it was bloody. We just couldn't carry on and decided to leave.

Verdict: buy smaller wings so it'll cook through and it'll take less time to cook. 

Service: 2 or 3 chefs, 3 servers. Way too overstaffed and they were all chatting up a storm instead of servicing customers. I feel like they were never trained properly.

Hygiene: why the siracha and condiments look dirty af? I never seen the siracha and ketchup so dark in my life.

This completely ruined my night. I won't  recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Perhaps a little over hyped, the experience was good nonetheless. 

Classic Taiwanese fried chicken flavour. 

Wings were good 4/5
Chicken steak was huge 4/5
Chicken bites were pretty good but not the best Ive had 3/5
Pork sandwich 4/5 very tasty
Chicken breast piece was good just huge, lol 4/5

I would give it a 4/5 but I do not want to mislead anyone since I will never be returning to this location despite the tasty food. 

If you are in the area or live in Mississauga try it out."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and two other friends after a tennis session in Mississauga and decided to come here for lunch. This place was a nice little local place. There is seating for dine-in and the service style was kind of like a cross between fast food and a restaurant. So you would order the food and pay for it at the counter first and then get seated. The servers would then bring your food to your table. This place I find is good for a quick meal. In terms of the food quality, I thought it was average compared to other Taiwanese food I had from other place (but not in Mississauga area). I would come back to try other items on their menu next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon. There were a few people when we came. Was impressed by the carpeted floors, nice clean layout for a small place.

We got the Mini Koo Koo bites with rice and drink. Without the drink it's $8.99. With the drink it's $11.50. I was impressed by the serving size. The chicken was very tasty and crunchy. Was very happy with it.

We also tried their Kala Kala chicken leg for $3.50. We had to wait 15 minutes before this food arrived and man the chicken was hot (temperature hot) and tasty!  Another plus!

If I would pick between the 2 (chicken leg or chicken  bites), I would pick the chicken leg. But trust me both options are great!

To drink I got their original milk tea. This is the part that I kind of was dissapointed to, as I expected the drink to have more flavor or to be a little bit more sweet, but rather the milk tea was bland for my taste.

Over-all I would come back for sure! This place is cheap, got a great selection, and the food tastes really good!"}
{"text":"$3.50 for a piece of chicken isn't exactly great value for a resto in the Mississauga suburbs, but food's made to order and does taste great.

The chicken bites ($4.99) have a distinct sweet flavour to them and work great with a dusting of chilli powder (available at each table). The fried chicken pieces are more traditional in taste and have good crisp and are juicy inside.

The restaurant itself is decent sized with a fairly contemporary deco, and has a very casual atmosphere. 

To the owners: Would be nice to see a fried chicken only special for those of us who only want chicken. I'd pick Koo Koo Chicken over one of the fried chicken franchises any day if you offered better value."}
{"text":"Unless you come here for the chicken steak combo or their bbt, don't bother ordering anything else on their menu as they are sub-par or below. 

Koo Koo burger: The chicken lacks flavour. Too much bun.
Braised pork belly on rice: Rice is unevenly cooked; mostly mushy with some undercooked areas. Meat was not tender/melt-in-your-mouth. The picture on their menu is not realistic, there is no sauce on their rice so dish is quite dry. Egg was dry. Best part of the dish was the pickled veggies.
Koo Koo chicken bites: Lacks flavour - where is the five spice, the most essential part of Taiwanese popcorn chicken?
TW pork bao: Meat is not tender, felt greasy. Also lacked flavour.
Beef noodle soup: Nothing special, tasted like regular beef soup. Wasn't as sweet compared to other Taiwanese beef noodle soups. 

They have good service, but overall, this is not an authentic Taiwanese restaurant in terms of food."}
{"text":"I'd say 3.5 stars especially since they do taiwanese pretty well and not much other choice in the GTA. 

That being said,  their wait time is extremely long for what is coined as a night market food in Taiwan and is normally ready within a few seconds of ordering. 

Their basil seed drink was chunky and flavorless. 

Their fried intestines were good. Sizes are great,  can never finish out of fear of a heart attack lol

Service is good,  a plus for the free flavor shakers ^_^ chicken is crunchy and fatty and not dry. The batter is delicious without the shakers as well. 

Will go back to try out their other taiwanese dishes."}
{"text":"YER boi comes back with another ASIAN food review. 

So much like Chatimes idea of Asian Starbucks, some genius Taiwanese guy/girl goes: OH YO! WHAT IF THERE WAS ASIAN KFC? and the guy beside him goes: BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHHH thats the good one.

so pretty much this is Asian KFC. Literally, all dishes are chicken based, so if youre vegetarian you don't really have many options here, wouldn't recommend you guys hanging out here. STILL doe. you get choices between rice with chicken, noodles or just go with the western style chicken. ALL SERVED WITH BUBBLE TEA. that's like fusing asian starbucks and asian kfc together making the heaven of chicken. 

there's also these like spice cup thingies u can put on ur chicken and stuff. it's pretty much dabomb.com. 

so if you're gweilo or not come to koo koo chicken for some good fried chicken.

HCNY yelpsters. 

P.S some manz said that they can't give you the wifi, which im pretty sure is BS but wifi doesn't define the beauty of the food."}
{"text":"Koo Koo Chicken is a small restaurant in a strip mall at Creditview and Eglinton. They specialize in Taiwanese style fried chicken. Taking pride in the freshness of their dishes, they give you notice that the wait time for your food can be as long as 20 minutes in order to prepare the chicken in the freshest way possible. 

They have a variety of combos centred around their signature fried chicken, and they also tackle many other aspects of Taiwanese cuisine. For my first visit, I ordered combo #1, which includes fried chicken steak (literally a basketful), a basket of fries, and a medium drink. No, not the boring old can of pop or bottle of water, but traditional Taiwanese style drinks. I went with the original milk tea with tapioca. For $9.95, a basketful of chicken and fries and a milk tea? Great value. 

On to the quality of the food - the drinks came first, after about 5 minutes. The milk tea here is absolutely superb. I haven't had anything like it since I went to Asia earlier this year. Next came the fries - they were thinly cut, similar to McDonalds' but more firm and less salty. Also great. After another 5 minutes, the chicken came. The quantity was overwhelming, but in a good way. The quality, as we soon found out, was just as remarkable. It was a unique blend of spices and seasonings that keeps you interested throughout the meal. 

One thing I liked about the tables was that each one had a set of 6 types of seasonings, along with the typical sauces (ketchup, etc.). Seaweed flakes, curry chicken seasoning, lemon chicken seasoning, black pepper, plum seasoning, and a shaker simply marked \"spicy\" - Koo Koo has something for everybody. Of course, I had to try every single one. I'd have to go with the seaweed as my favourite, while plum definitely gets the award for most interesting. 

I gotta admit, while I loved the experience, the while look of the restaurant was a little off-putting. It was very clean, but the decor just didn't make sense to me. Between the patterned carpet, yellow walls, and the corny, totally irrelevant stickers on the walls, the design of the restaurant left a little more to be desired. One of the walls read, I kid you not, \"I miss you because I never miss you.\" You can't make this up!

Overall, I'm so glad to have Koo Koo Chicken in Mississauga. There are few Taiwanese restaurant options in the city, which is vastly disproportionate to the quality of their food. I look forward to trying the other Taiwanese dishes at Koo Koo in my future visits."}
{"text":"????koo koo ,??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????koo koo ,???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I don't get the obsession.  Way to expensive for mediocre fried chicken.  Seriously, fast food chicken 6 pieces of leg and thighs for $30?  That's almost comparable pricing to gourmet sit down restaurants in Toronto!  And honestly, Popeyes is better!  To top it off,  terrible fries!  They are clearly frozen and not handcut.   I am always willing to pay god money for good food.   This s the 2nd time I've ordered take out from here.  I tried the boneless chicken the last time and it was a sweet batter.  It was terrible.  2nd experience trying something different did not change my mind."}
{"text":"This is indeed a Chinese restaurant, Taiwanese wannabe. Mini koo koo bites are tasteless. Nothing like Taiwanese popcorn chicken what so ever. Fried chicken was okay. But overall it was just bad."}
{"text":"Been hearing many good things about this place from my friends in Mississauga.  So on a weekday, after a meeting at the Mississauga site, I decided to pick up my friend and come here for a afternoon tea meal!

This place was empty on a Thursday at around 4pm, but it worked to my advantage as I can actually take some time to scan their confusing menus (too many to choose from!).  They have a set of combos similar to KFC or you can order separately via their menu.  I went with the Leg/Thigh combo which comes with one Leg and one Thigh or two of either Leg or Thigh, fries and a drink.  When I was asked by the cashier if I wanted a bbtea (standard drink) as a drink, I immediately finalized my order and paid. (FYI, they don't accept credit cards, so bring some cash with you!)

Once I paid, they gave me a number and I found one of the many tables in the restaurant and waited patiently.  The first thing I noticed on the table is the amount of seasonings they have for you do use and DIY (Do It Yourself) the flavour of the chicken to your liking!!  As they only fry the chicken after you order, it did take a bit of time before my meal arrived.

Since the chickens are fried fresh, the chickens are definitely better than KFC!  Lots of meat and fried to perfection!  Chicken with fries and a bbtea drink for just 8.99$ plus tax, who wants to go to KFC still if you are in the area?!! 

I was very pleased with the food and the concept of DIYing the chicken flavour by utilizing the variety of seasonings they offer!  I heard they also serve Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken, so next time if I am in Mississauga again for meetings or just for leisure I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Taiwanese fried chicken, and it will be the last time having it...The batter is on the sweet side. I guess it is supposed to be sweet based on good reviews?   Although they have so many different seasonings on the table so that you can spice up your fries and chickens, I still was not able to get over with the sweetness in the batter. 

I have to mention good things about this place too: huge portions, fast service, and reasonable price. Everything else except for food was great. That's why I can only give three stars because it all comes down to food in the end. Maybe I am just not used to having sweet exterior for fried chickens."}
{"text":"The restaurant is tucked away in a small plaza in Mississauga and wasn't much to look at, but oh my god, the chicken is delicious!

I only got a chance to try the koo koo bites (their version of popcorn chicken), which were perfectly crispy and juicy on the inside. I ordered it as a combo with rice. It also came with some garlic green beans, tofu and orange wedges as sides, which were all pretty tasty. It did not look like a lot of food, but I was completely stuffed at the end. I would definitely recommend splurging the extra dollar to get the rice combo instead of fries. You get more bang for your buck. I also really enjoyed the assortment of spices provided on every table, so you could customize how seasoned you want your chicken to be.

The combo also comes with a regular sized drink. I ordered the milk tea with chia seeds and grass jelly. The first few sips were delicious, but towards the end, the chia seeds got really overwhelming and made the drink taste bland. I will stick with tapioca in the future.

I would dock half a star for service. We were seated at a dirty table and had to remind the wait staff to clean it up after waiting a while. The food did arrive pretty fast, but were thrown at our table without telling us what they were. It was probably due to being understaffed. We did show up at prime dinner hour and the entire restaurant was packed full.

The next time I'm in the neighbourhood, I would definitely come back again and try some other menu items!"}
{"text":"Drove half an hour to try them out. It was relatively quiet when we came in and we ordered two items from the menu. I had the mini kookoo bites with rice and my husband had the chicken leg/thigh combo. Man, where do I start.. well, the side dish on my plate was questionable..the corn tasted funny as if it sat on the plate for awhile.. and the pickled \"salad\" thing looked unappetizing I just didn't even bother. However, I did like the chicken and sprinkled with the spicy powder they had on the table saved it..oh, and the original bubble tea that I chose with my meal was too bland for me. On another note, my husband liked his order overall, including his drink, so all isn't so bad I guess.

Honestly, its an okay type of chicken place. If your familiar with the taste of taiwanese chicken then you will sort of like this place depending on your taste buds. I personally wasn't blown away, but it isn't bad either. If I lived around the area I would order take out from them from time to time than go to a kfc since its cooked fresh and not over salted by some generated factory.

Overall, its an okay place for me.. not sure if its worth the drive in the future since other similar places are more accessible for me ..but see if you like it!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the better fried chicken places in Mississauga. Tucked away on Creditview Rd where no one expected there to be a Taiwanese fried chicken joint. 

The restaurant is hidden and may take some effort to find since it's located in a seemingly unnoticed plaza. The restaurant is small and looks like it seats around 25 people at a time. Since it's small it does get pack pretty quickly and gets quite loud. When the orders start coming in, you'll be standing in line for a while before they can take your order. 

I got the chicken steak and fries combo. The chicken itself was juicy but stringy at the same time. It has some sweetness to the flavor which depending on your flavor profile is a hit or miss for you. The nice thing about the place was the types of try spices you get with put on the chicken when it comes to you. Ranging from fruit powders like lemon and plum to curry chicken and spicy (this is hotter than you think). The fries were disappointing dry and over baked they didn't have that satisfying crunch factor.

All in all, Koo Koo chicken does a good version of the taiwanese fried chicken but  if you're willing to driving downtown I would make the extra trip time down."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE KooKoo Chicken! I often crave it! The koo koo bites, chicken steak, Taiwanese pork sandwiches, mango smoothie and chicken skins are my go to's.  They're great for take out as well. They even pack a variety of their seasonings for you."}
{"text":"Not on the affordable side for a casual Taiwanese/Chinese food restaurant. Chicken steak was very tender and tasty but contains quite a few bones. The chicken came covered in a sweet and hot sauce but it was too sweet IMO."}
{"text":"The quality has been day and night. The chicken filet used to be huge and the quality of the meat was amazing. After the original owner left, I have tried 3 times and it's been very disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't know if I'm just spoiled from the east part of GTA or if this place just wasn't good, but I don't get how it has 4 stars. 
Went to eat with 8 other colleagues after work- I understand that they just opened so service would've been a bit slow, but my friends who ordered the \"koo koo chicken combo\" got their fried chicken 5-10 minutes before their fries. 
I had ordered the chicken steak on rice, oyster omelette, and the Taiwanese appetizer to share. 
The chicken steak had quite a few bones to it- it was a chicken breast with the rib bones, which I had not expected because when I think steak, I would think a boneless filet or a t-bone type. 
The Taiwanese appetizer was the biggest disappointment- I asked what was included and she told me that it was egg, sausage, and vermicelli. When the dish finally came (it was the last to come), I noticed that it wasn't vermicelli. It smelled really bad and we concluded that it was intestines. We brought it back to the girl who took our order and said that it wasn't what she told us, and turns out she thought that vermicelli is the same as intestines!  
She offered to change for something of the same value, which we chose the fried fish cakes and balls. They returned with the same dish (the rest of our egg and sausage pieces) swapped with fish cakes instead of intestines. Usually when something gets \"changed\", I expect a brand new dish instead of something modified with contents of the old dish. 
The oyster pancake was mediocre as well. I don't see why I would ever come back- I'm probably more likely to go to the KFC next door."}
{"text":"Taiwanese vermicelli was pretty good, they add some minced/paste garlic on top which is quite strong but I really like. 

Their appetizer platter is so not worth it - half of it is peanuts!

Both the koo koo chicken bites and crispy chicken skin are pretty oily...could not finish them. 

They have a tray of spices/powders that are truly Taiwanese and reminds me of night market street foods. I think some of them menu items are good and other not so great. Might have to try to find out, but overall it's decent. Would come back to try other food items only if I'm nearby."}
{"text":"Taiwanese chicken has to sound appetizing, right? I came here with 3 friends, and ordered the Koo Koo chicken bites and the large basket (6 thighs/legs, fries, milk tea).

Koo Koo bites are amazing, and I would definitely recommend them. Good value and unique taste. The basket was a bad idea - The chicken was juicy, but the taste wasn't there. I also think I had mild food poisoning the night of. The other saving grace was the seasoning for the fries, which included \"Plum\", \" Seaweed\", \"Curry\", and more!

If it wasn't for the bites, this review would have been much worse, but if you're in the area, you might as well give it a try."}
{"text":"The mini chicken bites are very tasty, crispy , good price, milk tea is good. Service is ok. It's a small place but seems like students like to have a small gathering maybe because it's close to U of T Mississauga?"}
{"text":"Yes, the chicken tastes as good as it looks in the pictures. Super crispy, juicy and pipping hot; this is fried chicken done right. It takes a few minutes for your chicken to be prepared but I assure you it's worth the wait!

This place is like Popeyes with an asian flare. The chicken has subtle spices and lightly marinated so that you can flavour is yourself. They have various spices on the tables so that you can custom create your own flavours; curry, black pepper, plum...etc.

This place is slightly on the pricier side and I would not order their Taiwanese popcorn chicken (tough call but I've had better). It's a self serve joint so don't come expecting that they will roll out the red carpet for you.

There's something about Sauga and food. It's places like Koo Koo that always seem to surprise me out of the blue."}
{"text":"Love the food here, but is kinda expensive for fast food"}
{"text":"I love their stuff! Some pretty authentic Taiwanese food. Not \"hot off the night markets of Taiwan,\" but a solid taiwanese experience for the average Canadian! I come here for an oyster omelette all the time, and will drive half an hour just to get one. They're filling and so tasty and fun to eat. It's always better to eat in here, but I almost always take them home nowadays and the food is still delicious to go. The atmosphere here is warm and I don't mind eating in, but it's not exactly cozy. If you would like water, they have a self serve station at the back.

I also like their kookoo bites, which is essentially popcorn chicken with a Taiwanese twist. They offer many powders/spices to sprinkle on your bites, I highly recommend the paprika and white pepper. Delicious!

Everything is tasty, but I wouldn't eat here every day. It's something I crave once in awhile, but I've had better Taiwanese food. Granted, for a Canadian location it's great, and absolutely deserves 4 stars. I also haven't tried the bubble tea yet!"}
{"text":"What happens when you type chicken into yelp while in Mississauga? You get a plethora of options that can be a tad overwhelming, luckily, thanks to a few pictures I knew I needed to give KooKoo Chicken a shot and I couldn't be happier with the result! This is a pretty basic looking place from the outside, but a magical wonderland of delicious fried chicken on the inside. The menu here is mostly Korean fried chicken though they do have chicken fried steak, fries, and a few other dishes for you if you aren't looking to kill that fried chicken urge. I ended up ordering the thigh/leg combo which came with a side order of French fries and and a can of ginger ale on the side. The food only took about 10 minutes to come out and it did not disappoint my mouth or my stomach. My only knowledge of Korean fried chicken comes from eating Hot Star in Toronto and the taste mirrors that, and for me that is some phenomenal chicken. It was juicy, tender, tasty, and even though I was very full, i probably could of kept going. The fries were pretty good and had a unique seasoning that I really enjoyed as well. Overall, I highly recommend this place to absolutely anyone who likes to eat food (and isn't vegan). Try the chicken and indulge!"}
{"text":"Quality fried chicken.  Good food and drinks all around.  It's a bit funny that there is such an authentic Taiwanese restaurant in this strip mall.  There's a Pho Dau Bo just a few doors away if you can't decide whether you want taiwanese or vietnamese food.

I like that they tell you up front that it's 20 minutes for the fried chicken.  For me, it took a bit less, about 15 minutes, even with the restaurant nearly full.  The chicken was very crispy and tender.  I thought it was a bit expensive at $3.25 a piece, but you get the quality that you pay for.  Bubble tea tasted clean and refreshing.

It is a bit odd in that they orient the restaurant in a fast food style where you order and pay first, and then you go to assigned seating while you wait for them to bring out the food.  Interesting business concept."}
{"text":"If I were to rate this restaurant when it had first opened in late 2013, it would have been 5 stars. However, as with any new restaurant, I started to notice the deteroriation in quality and quantity.

I am a big fan of the porkbelly that is sandwiched between white buns and of course the fried chicken. I can attest to the fact that the size of the porkbelly sandwiches used to much bigger and have recently not only become smaller, but more expensive. Yes, I am quite bitter about that.

The fried chicken is quite delicious and continues to be generous in size. There are also spices available in the restaurant to give the chicken that extra kick of flavour if desired.

However, let me just warn you, the service is very slow. You will need to be prepared to wait on average 10-15 minutes before any food arrives at the table."}
{"text":"Was good... Not the cheapest of places but really yummy Taiwanese style chicken... I do appreciate the seaweed and lemon sprinkles. Not gonna lie, the chicken fried streak was yummy but I'll probably pass on the bao next time.
The kookoo bites was melt in your mouth good and I'd have three servings if not for the fact it is deep fried chicken skin lol"}
{"text":"What I ordered: The bites
Plus: It came with flavouring salts and pepper to adjust seasoning to taste. 
Minus: CARTILAGE ALERT. Boneless, sure, but flexible-connective-tissue free? NO.

EDIT: also... the overwhelming smell of oil was intolerable for a lot of my friends. And no, not just for the girls haha"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced as they do add a nice amount of their chicken.  I grabbed the mini kookoo combo and it comes with veggies (broccoli in mine) a little tofu and rice plus a drink.  
Their chicken is delicious and I also love their lemonade!
I would like to see the price go down just a little bit.  
A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"The staff were pleasant and hospitable. 
Food was great! I ordered the 2 chicken with fries and btea, fried chicken skin was very crispy and tasty!! ( I recommend it), and my boyfriend ordered the chicken steak combo with btea. It was delicious but they smothered the chicken steak with a lot of sauce. I would order it next time but ask for the sauce on the side. Overall I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Its just small and not that many tables. The food is outstanding! Anything fried here takes amazing. Price is great value. I would come here again and again! Thank you Koo Koo! Come to Brampton."}
{"text":"KooKoo chicken has definitely improved the last time I visited (which was about 3 years back of so) around their opening time. It used to be really oily chicken and you could taste the grease but they've definitely worked on the quality and I love it!

As one of the few places offering Taiwanese food, the KooKoo bites are really good! Kinda like popcorn chicken (or is it?) it's very delicious and not too heavy if you are not feeling devouring an entire deep fried steak. The prices have gone up over the years so it's not a place to grab food to eat from on a constant basis. 

Overall would return for sure for another experience!"}
{"text":"Solid 4/5. I have to say that I was so excited to try this place after seeing all the yelp reviews. I ordered takeout: mini koo koo bites meal on rice with sweet potato wedges on the side and a mango bubble tea smoothie. I was not a fan of the fatty pork on top of my rice...the sweet potato wedges were alright. It came with a seasoning and that added a nice touch. The mini koo koo bites were fresh, yummy and not too greasy. I was comparing the bites to bubble republics Taiwanese fried chicken bites and I have to say BR is 5/5 and koo koo is a 4/5. The chicken was good and the mayo dip was nice but I just feel it was lacking in that authentic flavour.... Perhaps I should try something else on their menu like the chicken steak... Anyways, I'm glad I finally got to try this place... PS the mango smoothie was the highlight of my meal... Not too sweet and just ohh so yummy with LOTS of tapioca. PPS. Their hours of operation are a bit bummy. I feel if they were open for lunch they'd get lots of business because of the highschool across the street."}
{"text":"If I was to just reviewed the fried chicken and their koo koo bites I would give them a 5 star review.. Their chicken was crispy, juicy and fresh. They offered different seasonings to sprinkle on top of your chicken for extra flavour but I feel like the chicken was tasty enough without the seasonings. The fries were crispy and tasted delicious with the seaweed seasoning.

I also ordered the braised pork belly rice and it was just ok... It wasn't bad but wasn't anything special..

They also serve bubble tea and it wasn't bad. We ordered the milk tea with grass jelly. It wasn't watered down and the it was milky with a good tea flavour.. Not sure if that makes sense. It also wasn't too sweet. 

I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for some good fried chicken. We ordered combo 5 which came with 5 pieces of fried chicken (choice of legs or thighs), koo koo bites and fries for around $16.."}
{"text":"This restaurant has gone through several ownership changes (assumption). The quality of the food is not like it used to be. I ordered KooKoo chicken Rice combo and the food took a lot longer. 
When the food finally arrived the Chicken was its usual quality, but the veggies and rice were COLD and NOT FRESH. It seemed the rice was from the night before or just taken out of the fridge and nuked.  When going out to eat you expect to consume Fresh food, unfortunately this restaurant no longer provides that Value anymore."}
{"text":"Went there with my kid, and we all got sick the next day. This place is not maintain. And the kitchen looks disgusting."}
{"text":"This is the go-to spot for Taiwanese fried chicken. I usually order the fried chicken steak with fries but sometimes I like to order the combo with rice. My suggestion is to ask for the sauce on the side unless you want your chicken steak slathered in sweet and sour sauce. The portions here are massive and you will likely have some left overs for take out. 

My gf usually orders the chicken wings and I suggest based on portion size to order 2 or 3 pieces as that should suffice. We made the mistake of ordering 8pcs of wings and did not even finish half of it. 

We also ordered the deep fried chicken skin which is hit or miss. On prior visits the skin was nice and crispy, while most recently the skin was quite chewy and lacked the crunch it usually has. 

Also, the Taiwanese pork sandwiches are good as an appetizer but I suggest sharing one between two people as it can get quite filling."}
{"text":"I come here as a vegan - Best deep fried king oyster mushrooms!! They are sold out every few days, they definitely need to stock more..
I used to travel to north York for other mushrooms but now I can get them here in sauga! I (over)load up on spice and whatever else I like, at my discretion.
I try to go less now so the workers don't know remember me as easy..."}
{"text":"Really good chicken! The prices are fair and the service is quick. Just don't come on a Friday night and expect to dine in."}
{"text":"After reading the raving reviews by other Yelpers my boyfriend and I decided that we should check it out. We came on a Wednesday evening (6 pm) so it wasn't quite busy until after we left. The cashier was friendly and pleasantly answered questions I had. She didn't mention that there was a 20 minute wait but there was a sign taped to the front of the cash register. We both ordered the combo that came with 2 chicken pieces (leg and thigh), fries, and drink. It came out to $20 and change after taxes. I thought it was expensive compared to other places like Popeyes.

It's an interesting concept that we would order at the front and directed to which table to sit at. About five minutes in we were served our drink and fries. I had the grass jelly milk tea and he had the lemonade with ai-yu jelly. Both drinks tasted yummy but I didn't like the grass jelly that much. The fries were average in our opinion. About 10-15 minutes later our chicken arrived. It was super hot so we knew that they were freshly fried. We liked how it was quite moist and crispy. It looked exactly like the chicken at Popeyes but larger in size. 

I felt very unhealthy eating at Koo Koo Chicken lol. I think I'll occasionally go here if I want fried chicken and bubble tea at the same time. However, I find the prices a bit steep for fried chicken."}
{"text":"I was so glad to discover this Tawainese style chicken restaurant! The whole place reminds me so much of chicken joints in Asia: smiling chicken logo, wall decals that, although adorable, don't necessarily make sense, quick service, and a no frills dining area. The combos are such a good deal; can't go wrong with a basket of thin, crispy fries, deliciously seasoned and perfectly fried chicken bites, and your choice of bubble tea for $8.50. There's a good variety of bubble tea to choose from (honey lemon, milk teas, slushies/smoothies). As one review stated below, there really is a seasoning for everyone. I am a huge fan of the curry seasoning! This will be my new stop for fried chicken now. A great gem in Sauga!"}
{"text":"Ordered their Koo Koo Chicken Burger Combo and Honey Lemon Juice.

The concept is unique, but it's not my cup of tea.

Chicken is not marinated in anything, it's so bland it's hard to get through. The powders on the table did not help the flavour. Again, like the concept, but I still think that the chicken could use some sort of marination for their powders to adhere to.
Fries were lukewarm when we got them, and just tasted like pepper.

My drink was good, I didn't mind the first few sips, after that it was just too sweet.

My fiance ordered their Koo Koo Chicken Steak and it was dripping in grease. It literally left a pool of oil in his tray. He did say that the powders did make a difference in his dish, but really not by much. We tried all the powders and felt that the \"Spicy\" one was the best to add any kind of flavour.

I've heard great things about this place and I'm left disappointed that it did not stand up to its rave reviews. 

Will not return."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for 3 times but they either closed too early (10pm) or still on renovation. Lol Finally tried it after coming the 4th time. And become a regular customer here.
Popcorn chicken is good. Remember to add their flavour powder. 
Love their chicken steak too but is a bit too sweet for me. 
Overall it is my fav Taiwanese food spot in Mississauga."}
{"text":"If I was just reviewing the food, I'd give KooKoo a full 5 stars without hesitation. Their chicken is perfectly crisp, incredibly fresh, and never very oily. The 20 minute waiting time isn't a problem, especially when you're getting such great chicken. The restaurant has even placed 6 shaker bottles on each table (Seaweed, Chili, etc.), which I think is quite cute, but I prefer the chicken as it is. The KooKoo bites are my personal favourite! 

Also, the taro smoothie is hands-down the best  I've ever had (like, in my life). I'd drink it more often, but too bad it only comes in a large size I can never seem to finish alone.  

The only reason I'm stripping KooKoo of their full s5 tars is because the food is a tad more pricey than other food of its sort. But it's totally worth it once in a while. 

The completely arbitrary and random wall-decor always makes me laugh. (I miss you because I never miss you). 

KooKoo's a great place that you should definitely try if you're a fried chicken connaisseur :)"}
{"text":"Ordered  a few times. The quality of the fried chicken is very average. I would not go back. The flavours are 'ok'. Not many variety of bubble teas and drink. Could improve the quality and taste of the fried chicken. Service is good."}
{"text":"KFC/Popeye's made-to-order AND with an ethnic twist!

I was in the area, had this place on bookmark, and PMS'g, so I thought that I'd drop by.  I wanted to order the Taiwanese Pork Sandwiches - which I think they serve at Momofuku for like $5/pc or something ridiculous - but skipped it as it did not come in a combo.

So instead, I ordered the Koo Koo Burger (think:  fresher, larger McChicken) Combo - $7.95, came with fries + drink.  The guy behind the counter suggested the Lemonade, so I got that as opposed to a Milky BBT.  I probably waited 10mins for my order.  Both items were piping hot!

Since it was an in-between time, ~4pm, I saved the food for later and drank the Lemonade.  Drink was not particularly my fav with a fakey lemon taste which reminded me of dish soap, but it was not overly sugary which was good.  There were some clear jellies at the bottom and it was quite refreshing.  Personally, I don't like fakey citrusy drinks, so I probably wouldn't order this one again.

Ate the burger a coupla hours later and it was still GOOD.  Despite being fried, the chicken itself is still moist which is contrary to those chain-fried chicken places.

Anyway, if you're in the mood for fried chicken, I'd definitely opt for this place before I even think of KFC/Popeye's.  Again, since everything is made-to-order, it does take time to prepare, so don't expect McSpeed. 

Maybe it's a good thing that it's not in my 'hood??"}
{"text":"Great prices for their combos and great flavors. As soon as you walk in, you can smell the fried chicken! From what my Taiwanese friends say, it's pretty solid for sauga and definitely worth a try at least once. Their logo makes me laugh every time. My only gripe is the atmosphere and colors of the dining area aren't quite the best, and the tables can sometimes be a little dirty.

UPDATE: Sad to say after coming back recently, this place has definitely gone down hill. Service is extremely slow, and it seems the chicken is now lacking in flavor. None of the food that came to my table seemed hot and was only luke-warm/borderline cold. They give you smaller portions of sides and chicken and much more rice (old, dry rice mind you). I love this place and all, but they've definitely lost their standards. I hope they're able to get themselves back on their feet."}
{"text":"I found this place by fluke, literally because I go to Pho Dau Bo which is in the same plaza and I'm so glad that I found this place and I've actually been at KooKoo Chicken multiple times and been wanting to write up a review for these guys.

I love this place, and as a Taiwanese person, it brings memories of me going to night market and being able to experience near identical flavours to what I've had at the bustling night markets in Taiwan.  It's a small, and from the outside looks like a rather unimpressive place to dine at, but it's not a place to turn your back on, it's a place that offers up authentic Taiwanese food.  Just note that you go up to the cashier to order your food (and pay it) and then have yourself seated and they'll serve it to you. 

Things that I would definitely recommend, their fried chicken steak (SO good, and that breading, well, that's what makes TW chicken steam so unique, has a certain sweetness/aromatic taste that blows KFC out of the water).  Also, popcorn chicken is really good, try it in a gwa bao or have the meal which isn't too expensive (you typically won't spend more than $10, unless you get their chicken steak which CAN get pricy).

Definitely recommend anyone the in the Sauga area to give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of weeks ago for dinner on a whim for takeout to try and satisfy my popcorn chicken craving. I should've called in to place my order though :\ 

Got to the restaurant around 845pm, and there were 3-4 tables seated and a couple of them were waiting for food, which should've been a sign that I'd have to wait a bit for my order. Got myself the Koo Koo bites combo with rice, veggies and two small pieces of tofu, as well as a winter melon milk tea altogether for roughly $13 - about what I expected. Waited about 20min for everything to be finished which is a little longer than I would've liked though. 

Food was decent, not amazing but also not terrible - a nice option to have if you're craving Taiwanese fried chicken in the area. The bubble tea was decent as well, but again not really memorable."}
{"text":"This place is different from your regular KFC or Popeyes. 
They have Taiwanese style chicken. The chicken is only fried when ordered so there is usually a 5-10 minute wait. But the chicken is always fresh. 

It is located inside a plaza so there is plenty of parking.  
This place offers dine in or take out. It feels more like a cafeteria type of thing rather than a restaurant. Cash and debit only. 

My usual order is chicken bites, chicken steak, fried squid ball and fish cake platter and the braised pork on rice. All are reasonably priced. 

The chicken bites and chicken steaks are really tasty. They are crispy and flavourful. They are usually not overcooked so it's really juicy inside. The chicken bites are easier to eat whereas the chicken steak is more difficult. The chicken steak is a huge piece of chicken similar in taste to the chicken bites but there is bone in it. They offer flavoured powder to enhance the flavour of the chicken. They have seaweed, spicy, lemon, curry, plum and pepper. 

The squid ball and fish cake platter is also pretty delicious. But this dish can be found anywhere. Sometimes it is too oily.

I like the braised pork on rice here. The flavour seems to be stronger and the sauce is better. 

As for the wintermelon tea is really refreshing and not too sweet."}
{"text":"Deep fried goodness. In all honesty I would of enjoyed this more if I wasn't on a diet. Only had the chicken and yes it was tasty but not spectacular. I did enjoy my taro bubble tea one of the best around."}
{"text":"The fact that you can order bubble tea and fried chicken together is the best part of this resto. Both are sooooo goooood!! My bf loves all the spices you can choose from. Its really oily chicken but its so worth it. Service is okay though."}
{"text":"Hidden gem of Mississauga. Love the Oyster fry, Taiwanese fry chicken and lemonade there!"}
{"text":"they took away my peach black tea half sweet w/ tapioca...... pls bring back thanks.


chicken is still awesome but your getting 2 stars from me until my peach black tea comes back


best tapioca in town."}
{"text":"Today I came here with Amelia and Braden! We were the first ones in and the place quickly filled up at noon! We order a pork rice, a 6-piece chicken combo and a pearl milk tea. The rice was perfectly displayed with an egg, pork and sour cabbage, very tasty indeed! We wait 15 mins for the fresh fried chicken, well worth it! Tender juicy thighs which were perfectly seasoned! There were also extra spices you can add yourself! The pearl milk tea was savory as well! The place was very clean and service was excellent! We will be back to try their larger than your face chicken steak and popcorn chicken! Until next time!"}
{"text":"Tried this based on yelp reviews and my fellow yelpers got this right! The fried chicken is fresh and cooked on order so it takes about 15-20 minutes. We got the combo with six pieces and two orders of fries which is way too much for two people. The chicken was hot and crispy, and juicy. Also ordered the yam fries and fish cakes to snack on while we waited for the chicken. Typical Taiwanese snack foods but delicious nonetheless. Unfortunately can't substitute sweet potato fries in the combos even for an additional cost which was why we had to order it separately. They have drinks which are included in the combos. Winter melon drink was delicious but the milk tea with chia seeds and grass jelly was just too much milk and not enough tea flavour. Lots of different shakers on the tables so you can dust your chicken and fries to your liking. Not the healthiest meal but wasn't as greasy as other fast food chicken joints."}
{"text":"Small but nice fried chicken restaurant! I love the fried chicken and Taiwanese style pulled pork on a bun. The bubble tea's also good! Lucy, thank you for bringing me here lol"}
{"text":"Great little place, I highly suggest stopping here for chicken. I got chicken bites and French fries. The seasonings on both were delicious. I really enjoyed my food.
You walk in and there's a sign that says please wait to be seated in front of a counter. You don't actually wait to be seated, you have to walk to the counter, order your food, then find a table. There's quite a few fried chicken options but also other food available. They brought the food out as it was made. Everything was hot and yummy. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is my first review on Yelp so bear with me! =P

This place is a bit far for us but I finally convinced my friends to go there and boy we did not regret!

Among the 3 of us, we ordered
- 2 fried chicken steaks
- Taiwanese appetizer platter (intestine/sausage/peanuts)
- mini Koo Koo bites on rice (came with a bit of veggies)
- oyster omelette
- pork buns for 2
- a winter melon black tea with tapioca. 

When we saw the bill we thought it was kinda expensive ($50 ish) for a fast food joint, but when the food came we realized we had ordered way too much! The portions were pretty big and they did not lie - the chicken steak is as big as your face! Every thing was done really well. It was so good that we almost finished everything we ordered while packing the rest home. My friend prefers the Koo Koo bites to the chicken steaks cause the former is dark meat, but the white meat was also moist and flavourful. 

Now that we have found this place, we don't have to wait for the annual night markets to get good taiwanese food anymore!"}
{"text":"We got the chicken steak breast w/ fries and also the popcorn chicken with rice. I much preferred the popcorn chicken with rice compared to the chicken breast. The chicken breast was too dry for my liking, and the fries were pretty basic. I thought the popcorn chicken was amazing with the mayo and curry powder. I also liked the veggies that the rice combo comes with. Portion size was very generous too, and the drink was great - lemonade with some kind of jelly."}
{"text":"A small Taiwanese chicken joint with classic Taiwanese specials and very good fried chicken.  

The KooKoo chicken bites are crispy and light with very tender meat inside.  They go well with the 5 varieties of dry spices on the table: plum, lemon, chicken curry, seaweed, spicy and black pepper.

The atmosphere is a little bland, but generally clean and the more traditional rice and meat dishes are a little uninspiring.  Water is in a communal jug at the back, not to be confused with the bottle of Windex beside.  Service is prompt and professional."}
{"text":"Everything is great.

Just small place and long wait times.

ATMOSPHERE: Really casual. Typical fast food joint vibe.

SERVICE: Cashiers are always very helpful with the menu and efficient in taking orders. The wait for food to actually arrive does take some time. So service may seem slow, but worth the wait! (The fried chicken leg and thigh takes 20 min to cook. They do warn you about the wait when you order.)

PRICE: Reasonable. Especially the (delicious) pork buns - two buns for $5! Some may find the fried chicken combos a bit expensive compared to other fast food chains that serve fried chicken, but the quality of the chicken is much better here. So I think it's worth the price.

FOOD: So good. I've only tried a few things so far: the fried chicken (steaks, thigh and leg), pork buns, fries, Taiwanese appetizer platter, and bubble tea - and everything has been very tasty. When dining in, there are a slew of spices to choose from with which you can add further flavour to your fried chicken and/or fries. I love the chicken as is - especially the spicy thigh/legs are flavourful enough.


Every time I have a hankering for fried chicken now - Koo Koo is my go-to place. It's dangerous because it's SO close to home!

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about the legitimacy of this place because of its location and decor, but was very pleasantly surprised! My mom spent years living in Taiwan and was also pleased that the dishes were fairly authentic and yummy. The staff are very pleasant and the food comes out freshly made and piping hot (cold food is a deal breaker for me).

We ordered the combo 1, chicken steak w fries and a milk tea w chia and grass jelly and the 2 pork sandwiches. The chicken steak was delicious and huge and fresh! The tables also have a number is seasoning powders for you to add to the food which is pretty fun (the \"Black Pepper\" is actually the Asian \"wah-yeem\"... seasoning salt which is perfect on the chicken, the Lemon and Spicy seasonings were also good!). The fries were nothing special but really, who can say no to freshly fried potatoes? They had a seaweed shaker that we used on the fries that I quite liked. The bubble tea was great! It was NOT overly sweet and the chia and grass jelly were lovely in it. 

The Pork bao's were the fatty port belly cut but very legit Asian style pork belly. Filling and heavy so I will likely not order again but quite yummy.

The restaurant itself is quite tacky and feels more like a fast food joint/food court, but as long as you don't mind the casual style eating the food is worth it! Great job, guys!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken and bubble tea? DONE
(but they take about 20 minutes to make a drink.)

- Chicken steaks are deeeeelicious. GIGANTIC.
- Chicken legs are soooo yummy as well. A lot of batter on the loose skin!! But underneath is moist, hot chicken meat. mmmmmm
- Chicken and fries are seasoned with their special mix of pepper and spices. It's actually very flavourful without too much pepper power. Really yummy! 

They also serve other Taiwanese dishes such as chicken stew (vermicelli + $$ on the side). The chicken in this stew wasn't plain -it created the stew without losing its flavour! Nicely done.

Their menu is small (phew!) and you can pick whatever you want... combo (with chicken, fries, drink), just the chicken, JUST the fries, JUST the drinks... and other noodle dishes! Whatever you choose, the prices are reasonable!

TAKE-OUT IS DONE LIKE THIS:
- Minimum order of $35, plus $5 which includes gas and tips
- You may need to be patient with the girl taking the orders :p

Overall, the meals worked out to be $10 (+/- dollars) per person. I especially love that drinks are bubble tea!! (no more stale fountain drinks!!!!)
- bubble tea
- milk tea
- smoothies

Their bubble tea is also quite good surprisingly! I hate tapioca that are mushy. Here, their drinks are made with bouncy, chewy tapioca's! WILL HAPPILY RETURN :)

{"text":"Bubble tea, deep fried chicken and BR food.

This establishment sits quietly in the neighborhood of Creditview and Bristol. I wouldn't have noticed it passing by the plaza. None the less the storefront displays a bright yellow sign and the interior is pleasantly yellow as well.

Each chicken combo is accompanied with fries and bubble tea. Other than chicken, they do serve up some BR-like food.

I opted for the chicken burger combo which was accompanied with wedges (fries) and a choice of bubble tea. They also offer real fruit smoothies; as I recall them: Banana, Strawberry, Avocado, Mango and the mix of any of these combinations. I'm pretty sure I would of had to pay more for substituting a fruit smoothie for bubble tea but today the manager was nice and changed it for me without extra charge.

You just sit down and they would bring your order to your table. My other friends ordered the fried chicken and it takes about 15 minutes. My burger came out within 5 minutes. They used real chicken and it's nicely deep fried topped with loads of onions, lettuce and tomatoes. It was a really good burger. At each table they offer a variety of different spices that you can use to season your fries or chicken. My favourite is the plum seasoning.

I really hope in the future that they start serving more healthy options like substituting a salad for fries. Looking at the menu and having some much deep fried varieties is a little too much for me, I need some balance in my meals.

Be sure to try two things: Avocado shake and the plum seasoning."}
