I called and complained about my meal and the woman i spoke to had nothing to say but sorry! wa wa...never again"}
{"text":"I know this feeling.  After the 8th or 9th toilet bowl Olympics in the last 2 hours (It's now 4:49 AM) I recognize an old enemy.  Food poisoning.  Just peachy.  So here I am, bed-ridden when I should be standing naked on the sidewalk to distract the drivers.  The food wasn't even good.  I need to hire a person to pour me scotch in situations like this."}
{"text":"Stopped by this Chinese restaurant on Macleod Trail SW.  It's in a strip mall, right across from Seoul Korean Restaurant.  They have a small lunch buffet plus pop for only $6.95 + tax.  What a deal!  I didn't have the buffet though and opted to order from the menu: -  Pan fried dumplings - piping hot dumplings - tasted really good with the red wine vinegar - Won ton soup - hot broth with 12 wontons - Brocolli and Sugar Peas in Garlic Sauce - really impressed with this dish - very well done! - Shanghai Noodles with Pork - cooked with a dark soya sauce, cabbage, noodles and pork - Beef Chow Fun - light soya sauce, beef and bean sprouts  Reasonable prices and pleasant quick and attentive service."}
