{"text":"Pire expérience à vie! Ne faite jamais de réservation de groupe. On était 4 tables une vingtaine de personnes, une serveuse et demi pour le groupe. 1h15 d'attente pour recevoir notre plat! Aucune table n'a manger en même temps! Aucun service, rien ne nous a été offert pour s'excuser de l'attente. Quand on a osée demander du pain car on avait vraiment faim la serveuse nous a donné de l'attitude. Bref un gros 0 pour tout! On a mentionné notre mécontentement et on nous a dit que c'était normal d'attendre aussi longtemps pour un groupe!"}
{"text":"Nouveau restaurant depuis l'été 2012 dans le vieux Ste-Rose. Batisse champêtre et mignon petit restaurant à déjeurner. Bon service et la bouffe est bien. J'y retournerai car il est à quelques minutes de marche de la maison mais ce n'est pas mon meilleur restaurant pour déjeuner."}
{"text":"Located in Old St-Rose, this place was recommended by a \"friend\" and I couldn't help myself but to make a small family trip (of 3!) that same week to try it out for the first... and sadly what ended up being my most likely last time.  The place is located in a rustic old home that has clearly seen better days. Esthetically it's cute, with an emphasis on wood... EVERYWHERE. Overpriced paintings are offered (without frames of course) to patrons willing to pay for the art pieces show-cased by the resto by local artists.  The place seemed cleaned enough... well the part that is well-traveled anyways. I did found cobwebs in a few corners while admiring all the wood, the floors didn't seem polished for a shop that just opened up and one huge problem for us was this disgustingly dirty high chair provided for our child that had many old food stains engraved into it. I'm not one of those over-protective parents but let's be honest with ourselves.... if countless stains are found on a high chair, odds are, they aren't cleaned anywhere as well as they should have.  The place was relatively quiet at first but more patrons showed up as we were leaving and the place was almost quarter full by 10 AM on a Saturday. Take that as you'd like.  Moving on to the food, I went with the generic full breakfast plate named \"Le Sans Compromis\" (No Compromises) which consisted of eggs, bread, bacon, ham, 'cretons', beans, crepe or french toast. I felt like the crepe today . The food took about 10 minutes which was pretty fast.   The eggs were good, the sausages were good, the cretons were amazing.... and it stops there. The bread was burnt, the beans were \"mildly cold?\" (confused), the bacon felt off somehow (how? it's bacon!) and the crepe was this tiny thing that should be fine for a 2 year old to eat, nevermind a grown man for a meal called \"NO COMPROMISES\".   The coffee was the standard not impressive filter kind that stays in the pot until a client asks for it. Opt for a latte, you'd be better off.  All in all, we weren't impressed by our breakfast selections and it was a visit to forget. I also got a case of indigestion less than 8 hours later... related perhaps? Needless to state, cheer on the cheer on the cake for this visit.  The price-tag didn't merit what we got and once again, places like L'Oeufrier and Allo Mon Coco rule supreme. I'd like to find other choices but it's getting harder and harder fellow Yelpers....  The service was prompt and very courteous thus why they get a 2 star."}
