{"text":"The food was very average, we would have left feeling neutral but they added a cover charge to our bill of 2.50 per person that we were not made aware."}
{"text":"Worst food my husband and I have had in Italy!  The lasagna and cannolinni were frozen meal quality and the chicken cutlets were dry and tasteless.  Beware, on Lago di Como, in the town of bellagio, everything is overpriced and you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"They were very nice. The decor was different but we loved the modern look. The prices were fair. Two meals and a bottle of wine for under 50 Euros you can't beat that in Bellagio. They were off the beaten path but is a gem no doubt.  If we are ever back in Bellagio we will go back there. The wait staff looked like they enjoyed being there. They had no problem with us only speaking English. I had the Spicy Pizza and my wife had the lasagna. It was great."}
{"text":"Meandering through the streets of Lake Como, I came upon my least favorite place during my visit. It was not bad by any means, but it was mediocre. We ordered Artichoke Ravioli and a pizza I can't remember any more. Again, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't outstanding in any sort of way. With so many yummy tasting places, it just wasn't worth it to eat mediocre food. Our service was good and prompt. The restroom didn't lock by the way. Considering this place is located in Lake Como, I probably wouldn't eat there again as I'd rather be outside enjoying the view than be bombarded by MTV of Italy."}
{"text":"Good food and very modern interior.  We ordered pizza and special of the day menu with the house wine.  Everything was really good.  The pizza is not by slice: ) get ready to finish all pizza by yourself."}
{"text":"Ok..so this place is great granted and it probably isn't somewhere I would go again but it's not bad. The pizza was tasty and filling. Not the best pizza I have had but not too bad. The décor doesn't really match the areas vibe but nonetheless it was chic and clean. The staff was friendly. The price wasn't too bad considering how pricey restaraunts can be."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice lunch here while in Lake Como (Bellagio to be exact). Pizza was a nice size and very fresh tasty ingredients. My wife enjoyed the gnocchi's and we both thought the service was great.   This restaurant had air conditioning!! Which during hot summer days is a super welcome thing. It was soupy hot when we visited Como and cooling off with a local beer and nice lunch was great.   Food, drinks, bread, pleasant service and a clean restroom!! Pretty much all travelers will enjoy that combination.   Happy Eating and Travels Peoples!!"}
{"text":"Indeed, a solid two star kind of place. I was walking to another restaurant that was rated higher on yelp. Then I noticed the daily special for 18.5 on their blackboard outside. One of the staff members were standing outside. I thought to check out the restaurant. Since it seemed quiet, I decided to stay and eat. I ordered the brown pasta and veal. The pasta was very mediocre. The veal was a little dry and tough. It was served with an acidic mushroom sauce. Both dishes were somewhat dissatisfying.   There was a cover charge of 2.5. It was written on the menu (I had to look up the word). Anyhow, the service was nice enough but like other reviews said, it's not really a place you would want to eat again with all the other options present."}
{"text":"The food was passable except for the Lardon, which was raw fatty bacon smothered in honey. It attracted flies that embedded in the honey. A disgusting start. I asked them to take it away and not bring another one, but they brought it anyway and wouldn't remove it. So it sat uneaten but on the bill. The Champagne with a Kir Royale was undrinkable, which they replaced with a white wine but then insisted on charging for both. The servers were acceptable but one had no English and had no idea what to do. The total experience was uncomfortable from start to finish. If all you want is pizza and salad, it's an attractive place well located. But there are many better places in Bellagio for a meal, and there is very little to recommend here.  Except there is a large TV in the dining room that some would appreciate but most do not."}
