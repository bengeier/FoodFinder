{"text":"Food is good and portions are large, however, they've raised their prices significantly over the last few months and they have a very limited wine selection (VERY limited).  It's usually almost empty with only a few tables the few times I've been there.  Given the lack of dining options in Airdrie it would be nice if it was a more affordable option like it was when we first moved here 9 months ago."}
{"text":"I ordered from paros for delivery, paid $30 including tip for one beef skewer a bunch of gross rice and lettuce in the greek salad. Not too impressed about that. They didnt even supply a fork or a napkin in the bag. I had to go looking for one afterward. The delivery guy was nice enough to go to a gas station and get me one."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely incredible.  The staff was helpful in making decisions for what to eat.  I have only been here a few times but will definitely be going back.  The decor definitely leaves a bit to be desired but has a cozy feel.  The reason for the 4/5 is that the food service is a little slow so i wouldn't recommend Paros if you have other places to be unless you get there plenty early.  Once the food arrives however be ready to stretch your stomach muscles as you will get more than enough food.  I highly recommend the Mixed Grill for a first time visitor, and the Kalamari (fried squid) and Saganaki (Flaming Cheese) are both amazing appetizers.  All in all a great place if you have time to sit down and have a great meal with family or friends."}
{"text":"Paros is a great Greek restaurant in Airdrie. My husband and I have gone there many times since moving to Airdrie almost 6 years ago. The food is consistently good and sometimes amazingly good. I'll knock it down a star because the decor is looking tired and needs a facelift. If you are looking for great Greek food and don't care so much about the decor, I highly recommend Paros."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Everything you expect from a non chain place. Went there for lunch and found a quite place with all the locals enjoying lunch (a sign something is great). The food was good and ample letting me walk out full. I had the salmon steak with only one compliant...it was a little dry. But that was not a deal breaker. This is what I love about small non chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Food made with love and passion.  My favourite and now YOUR favourite Greek restaurant in and around this city.   Be prepared for real home style Greek cuisine complete with romantic Mediterranean decor. When you are here, you are family! As mentioned from Alan G. (I'm his better half ;) ) each plate is carefully inspected by Mama herself. If it's not up to her high standards, it's not making it to your table! So you can rest assure that the taste and quality are consistently high.   Paros service is simply amazing. Be prepared to be treated like family and wowed because this is what they enjoy doing!   What I recommend - Saganaki (OPA!), Spanakopita, Horiatiki Salad (you will go no where else for traditional Greek salad), Prawns & Scallop Souvlaki, Kalamari, Roast lemon potatoes AND... Baklava!!!!!  Date night, family event, Birthday party or whatever!   Eat, drink and be Greek!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was good, prices in range of quality.  The decorations are quite outdated. I looks like a cheap movie set for Greese from the 50's. I half expected a bad 70's adult film to start."}
{"text":"Decor looks a bit old, but the food is delicious. I always order the Greek chicken, it comes with two full breasts, salad and your choice of rice or potatoes. (Always get the potatoes.) You can also ask for both at no charge. I always get a side of tzatziki because I adore it with my potatoes.   I never have room for dessert or anything else because I always leave full and sometimes over stuffed! Great place, especially during lunch time when most entrees are about half the price for the same amount of food.  Make reservations well in advance for holidays! :)"}
{"text":"Well I have to say my experience today was just not great, ordered flaming cheese for my appetizer and what arrived was a significantly smaller portion than previously experienced, yet the price was still the same. Ordered calamari with potatoes and rice, onlu to recieve sorta warm  calamari with mushy potatoes and overcooked/dry rice with less than 2 tblspoons of tzatziki sauce.  Waitress was less then friendly and you can tell the place is struggling, what used to be a packed place is now less than 4 tables filled with patrons.  the place needs a menu and decor makeover."}
{"text":"Very good food and atmosphere for a great evening with family and friends. Except the waiting time goes on for a very long time. Even for an appetizer it takes nearly 50 minutes"}
{"text":"I go there for the steak. I really love that steak. People are friendly and I for sure will go there again. But I've done a lot of deliveries for them and every time I walk into their kitchen to pick up a delivery, I see at least 2 people smoking and cooking. Kitchen isn't the cleanest either. But I just try not to think about that when I eat. Just can't help cause i love their steak"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and I feel this is going to be the last. Last time I was there with a group of friends and our kids and nothing was AMAZING as Sherry A said. It was not the best Greek food I have ever had as I saw another reviewer posted. I had far more enjoyable meals from Opa then Paros. Our table was recommended their \"famous potatoes\" and they were gross all you could taste was the lemon.I don't know why these are \"famous\". No one at our table enjoyed them. Our Table left hunger and talking with some of them after they had to stop and grab some fast food on their way home. And the service was lacking. Waitress almost never came around even when out glasses were empty and we needed a top off. And that day they could only take cash. Made a reservation drove all the way from Calgary and they couldn't have been bothered to let us know before coming up....? Poor service.  Had to us the bathrooms that were renovated. And there the only place for the toilet paper was the sitting on the back of the toilet. Being 7 months pregnant not the easiest for me to get at when I needed."}
{"text":"I had lunch here last week and it was the best overall dining experience I have had while visiting Airdrie in terms of accommodating, friendly service, good quality, freshness and taste, portion size and pricing. It was so good, I returned for dinner. Prices are higher at dinner for what seems to be the same portion. Service was not as attentive and friendly as it had been at lunch, but everything else was great. Great tasting, fresh food, reasonably priced. I'll definitely return. I wish they would bring the salads put prior to the entree."}
{"text":"Foods ok,   Worked in Greece restaurant for years in Victoria, not as good.  Not a change table in either washroom.  Quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Since moving to Calgary we had yet to try finding a decent greek restaurant.  After Kisamos in Steveston and Five Columns in Bellingham our expectations were high.  One night, we stopped outside Paros on Main to try them out as our first greek in Alberta.  While decent, unfortunately I think our search will continue.  The meal itself was okay, but there were elements that were not up to our expectations for the price we paid.  Firstly, we were forewarned when we arrived that they were out of their supposedly 'famous' potatoes.  If they are in such high demand and the restaurant has been around long enough, why are they unable to make sufficient quantities for their expected patronage?  Secondly, every single greek restaurant we have ever been to, even the terrible ones, start with some fresh fluffy warm pita bread even without appetizers, but not at Paros on Main.  We ordered a Kleftiko dinner each and at every other restaurant we've been to they are large juicy fall-off-the-bone roasts with beautiful flavours and are usually a good sized shank, which comes with salad, rice, potatoes, and tzatziki.  What we got for meat was more like roast beef - a dry steak of lamb meat which was tough to chew and sadly a waste of the delicious crust on the outside.  I ordered the caesar salad and rice (as there were no potatoes and you actually had to choose between rice or potato???).  The caesar came with dressing, cheese and a lemon wedge but no croutons or bacon bits so it tasted plain.  The lettuce was fresh but that only does so much.  The rice I had to send back because they put vegetables in it including mushrooms. I am allergic to mushrooms and since when does greek rice come with mushrooms?  I've only ever seen that at restaurants who don't know how to flavour their rice. D was able to eat his rice and said I was right in that it was dry and flavourless.  For the price we paid and the flavour/texture of the food, I'm surprised this restaurant is so popular and we will keep searching for something closer to the juicy, beautiful greek lamb we're used to and love."}
{"text":"Very good and portions are big!! The server was super friendly and fast! We had the appetizer platter and mix meat and veggies platter! Shared between 4 people and have tons of left overs!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this Greek restaurant in Airdrie - wanted something a little different and I remember enjoying Paros Souvla in Calgary so we decided to give this a try.  Atmosphere:  3/5  We were seated quickly, but it was starting to get busy by the time we arrived.  There was adequate parking on the front or side street.  The restaurant was a little too dark for me though and our table was also quite small, but other than that, it was a good atmosphere.  Food: 4/5  I had the Moussaka - eggplant and meat casserole which was delicious - perfect portion size.  It also came with Paros salad which was ok, and the roast lemon potatoes which were flavourful and tasty.    Service: 2.5/5  The restaurant seemed quite busy.  It took a little long to order and an even longer time for our food then bill to arrive.    Price: 3.5/5  Food was reasonably priced for the amount and quality.  Overall: 3/5  I enjoyed my meal here and would probably come back to try some of the other platters.  The only thing was that it seemed to have taken a very long time that night to order and then for food / bill to arrive."}
{"text":"We live in NW Calgary and this has quickly become our favourite Greek restaurant in Calgary and area.   We have been here a dozen times, and every dish we have seen come out of the kitchen is meticulously plated. My understanding is that the owner inspects every plate before it leaves the kitchen, and it shows. A new waiter told us he almost brought out a plate before inspection and was swiftly reprimanded with a cuff to the back of the head! The food always arrives fresh and piping hot, even with parties of 10+.  The service is friendly and attentive and very knowledgable of the menu. The restaurant decor is fresh and romantic, with a Mediterranean flare.   While all the dishes are fantastic, some of our favourites are the saganaki (flaming cheese! Opa!), calamari (best in Calgary), horiatiki salad, spanakopita and lamb kebabs.   Whether you are looking for a place for a first date, family celebration or are simply craving Greek cuisine, do not pass up Paros!"}
{"text":"Takeout was poor. Spanakopita was burned, as were the Souvlaki. Rice was an overcooked pile of mush, and the shrimp were mush.   Most of it did not get eaten and ended up in the trash.   If this place is under new management, I miss the old..."}
{"text":"Went here for a work luncheon. Food was great especially the potatoes. Had a wrap type meal and it was good, sauce was great. Ended up with food on my lap multiple times.  Wasnt very busy and food seemed to be slow, but how good it was made up for the wait."}
{"text":"Probably the best restaurant in Airdrie, and one of the best Greek restaurants I've ever been to. It's almost always quiet at night, and the servers are very good. Meals are very well priced, and with large portions. Entrees all come with Greek or Caesar salad and rice or potatoes. I'd easily recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Paros on main is the best Greek food I've had. Ever. Their roasted potatoes have some kind of drug in them I'm sure. They are to die for. They have a fantastic menu and on certain days of the week they have belly dancers which is SUPER fun. If you go, you have to try the saganaki. Flaming cheese is where it is at, For sure. I love their Greek salad too it's so fresh and their dressing is dilly and light. If you manage to save to, try a Greek coffee, a slice of baklava, and a shot of ouzo."}
{"text":"Airdrie started out as a little town just outside of Calgary but it has certainly grown to a small city. I have to confess that I've been to Airdrie many times to visit friends but have never frequented any of their restaurants. One thing is for sure, you won't leave hungry. Paros on Main is a Greek restaurant. The deco is simple with the usual blue and Grecian ware found all over Greece. We didn't have to wait for a table but I have to warn you not to go there hungry or else order appetizers right away. We had arrived from an open house that served nibbles and only ordered entrees but these took over half an hour to arrive. I found Paros by searching for nearby restaurants via the Yelp app on my phone. There were $$ attached to the restaurant but really when you look at the portions this is a place for cheap eats. I had the kleftiko ($25) and my companion the grilled chicken ($21). The chicken entrée consisted of 2 HUGE chicken breasts, salad and potatoes. The lamb was 2 slices with salad and potatoes. You have a choice of Greek or Caesar Salad and either rice or potatoes. We both took home leftovers for a separate meal. The chicken was tender and moist and delicious according to my companion. The kleftiko I had was average. It lacked flavour. The potatoes were cooked through and well-seasoned with salt and lemon juice. The Greek salad was also average. I couldn't detect any oregano but it had a good proportion of kalamata olives and feta.  A favourite of regulars is the saganiki or flaming cheese. We didn't try it but it was certainly very popular with the other patrons. The servers at Paros certainly know how to present it with a flourish, they yell \"Opa!\" as they ignite the brandy and it's a good show of flames. The food is ok but not worth a drive to Airdrie for Greek food but certainly if you are in the area and craving Greek it would be a good place to stop. My companion made use of the facilities and reported that the ladies washroom was spotless. Our server was friendly and kept our drinks topped up. There is a great server to patron ratio, it looked as if there was a server per every two tables. Paros on Main is as its name suggests, right on Main Street, so there is street parking and we didn't have any problems finding a spot. The only caveat to the street parking is that it is only 1 hour parking till 9 p.m. at certain spots. I'm not sure how strictly enforced this is."}
{"text":"This was one of our best meals ever in Alberta. We started with the amazing Flaming Cheese. Our group shared the mixed grill and added a chicken souvlaki meal as well to share. For meat, my favourite was the pork souvlaki but the hubbies did love the lamb. The lemon potatoes are to die for and I loved the Greek salad. My son took the server's suggestion to have chicken souvlaki, rice and pita. It was perfect for him! Service was slow but we weren't in a rush and we found out later it was because someone called in sick that day. The Food is all prepared fresh for each table and was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was excellent.  Portions are huge and the Belly Dancers are a lot of fun."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in my hometown. Whenever I am back in town visiting family I always try to visit Paros. Small restaurant with great service. I always make sure that I get an order of the Saganaki in addition to the main course. Definitely on par with the more well known Greek restaurants in Calgary but located in Airdrie.  If you are ever in Airdrie and looking for some great Greek food, definitely head to Paros on Main."}
{"text":"Stopped here one late afternoon for some Greek food.  The food was quite tasty and large portion.  I had the souvlaki chicken and my husband had the beef one and we enjoyed our dinner.   We also had a starter of calamari and it was tender and very tasty ! The restaurant was quite busy and we lucked out and did not have to wait long to get seated."}
{"text":"My all time favorite greek place. The saganaki is great. The service is always with a smile! Cant give this place enough credit. I wish yelp had 6 stars, because this place is the real deal. Will be returning for sure"}
{"text":"I've been here close to a dozen times now and I'm still in love   The food it just amazing! The portions are humongous, the service is top notch, everything is always cooked perfectly. The tzatziki sauce is killer, the pitas are soft & warm... I could rant on and on.  Everyone I bring here is thrilled. It's the kind of meal that you wake up the next morning and think \"damn dinner last night was good\"! Worth every penny."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a recommendation from a friend.  Parking is convenient (at least at 7 pm on a Monday) and free, and the service was fairly quick.  I don't know if I can agree with Paul's review -- the portion sizes were some of the largest I've had at a Greek restaurant.  Tzatziki came by the tub, rather than by the teaspoon like most places.  The \"side order\" of rice was a heaping 12\" plateful, and each meal came with five roasted potato halves (most places are one or two).  Speaking of huge portions: the belly dancer came out while we were there.  It would have been somewhat less uncomfortable with her two portions near my face had my wife not been there with me, but at least my son got to enjoy the view.  I wouldn't call this the best Greek restaurant I've tried in the Calgary area, but it is certainly one I would frequent again.  P.S. - The tzatziki is about as garlicky as it gets.  You've been warned."}
