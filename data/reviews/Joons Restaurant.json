{"text":"One of my favorite Korean restaurants in Toronto. Great food and not expensive either. I always get the most popular dish (whose name i never remember), with rice cake, noodles, and cheese. The feelig after the meal is great!! Strongly recommend! Service is not the best, but for this price it's a lot better than other Korean town restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is great!  For me this is the best Tteokbokki I have had so far in the city! I would definitely add rice cakes and noodles. I normally get it quite spicy and avoid cheese because I find it reduces the spiciness that I like. :D  Definitely worth the trip to Koreatown!!"}
{"text":"Since moving to the Yonge & Shepperd area, I have become a big fan of Korean food, frequently eating at Owl of Minerva and Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu. A lot of people, however, have talked about Joon's Dak Gal Bee and mentioned to me that they enjoy eating here, so I decided to finally check it out with a few friends.  First impression of the menu: cheap prices relative to its competitors. What I quickly learned though, is that in the case of Joons, \"You get what you pay for.\"  The portions for everything were definitely smaller than average. The Dak Gal Bee, which has to be ordered in portions of 2, could definitely be consumed by one person. We had to order a Gam Ja Tang because we were still so hungry, and furthermore, it was the saddest Gam Ja Tang I've ever seen, with only 2/3 of the bowl filled up (compared to the overflowing bowl you get at Owl), two small pieces of pork bone, and no potatoes or soup fillers. Moreover, the sides you typically get at Korean restaurants (kim chi, radish, etc.) were also so small and not nearly as good.  Bottom line? I won't be returning to Joons ever again, and I feel sheepish for having strayed away from Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu (which I give 5 stars across the board) and Owl of Minerva, both down the street and much more worthwhile."}
{"text":"Joon's Special is the Dak Gal Bee (a table-top burner with a large wok that cooks raw ingredients together) The cool thing about it is that unlike western restaurants, the food was cooked right at our table by our waitress instead of being served already cooked. As my partner and I talked, the waitress prepared our food in less than fifteen minute! The basic Joon Special comes with only spicy chicken and veggies. Extra add-ons include rice cakes, sweet potato, and mozzarella cheese (a must get!). We got all the add-ons including noodles. It was fast, fresh and delicious! Home cooking at it's finest without all the prep time and clean up. Everything worked really well together! Complimentary side dishes were also given and are always refillable. we were offered mashed potatoes (yum!), kimichi, bean sprouts, and broccoli.  This restaurant is must try! i loved loved it!"}
{"text":"A great place to go after a cheap haircut in Korean town!  Always loved the spicy chicken pot - with rice cake, instant noodle and cheese on top, it's a Korean cheese fondue prepared right before one's eyes.  The side dishes are tasty as well - my favorite has always been the mashed potato. Every time I come I always had to order a second serving.  Great place for a small gathering with friends. Definitely a place I'd take out-of-town guests to try."}
{"text":"Went to this place about a year ago with my friend. We had the spicy chicken dak galbi with noodles and mozarella as my friend suggested it and said it was their signature dish. We shared it and both really loved it! The service was quite friendly as well from what I remember and it is nice, small cozy place! Will try their other location in North York around my area very soon as well. Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so overrated by my friends and I'm so disappointed with joons. My friends told me their chicken dish with cheese is amazing. So i went to order that on the \"table cooking\" page from their menu. We have to order at least two portions in order to have table cooking, so it costs $10.25 x2 = $20.50. And cheese needs to add extra $2.  The portion was so SMALL even we ordered 2.  The pan was big but there's not much food in it for $20!  And its not even table cooking, the waitress was cooking on one of the dining table (not in front of us) as if there's no space in the kitchen. The soon tofu was average but overall I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"Average food..poor service!!!  I ordered pork bone soup and 10 mins later I was told they ran out of rice and no substitute allowed. So if you run out of rice and can't offer me a substitute why am I here to eat food. The Manager said wait 20mins and the rice will be ready...I am not sitting here waiting for rice to cook, I can do that at home....if you run out of something then give me something else...I asked for noodles or potatoes and they said no....like WTF! I sat while my two friends finished their meals and left with no tip and never to return to this poor establishment."}
{"text":"Like the rest of the reviewers, the Dak Gal Bee is the thing to get here. My partner and I have had the non-spicy chicken with rice cakes, veggies and occasionally cheese probably about 10 times. We order that with 2 portions of rice and it's very delicious. Staff are attentive when it's cooking but sometimes it isn't clear how you should pay and you are sitting around for a while waiting for your bill."}
{"text":"Nope, nope, and nope. Worst meals I've had were at this restaurant. Tastes are bland. Ordered a hotpot of rice cakes that were supposed to be spicy and it tasted really awful. Just no."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and I LOVE this place (we love both locations equally lol). honestly I get cravings for their spicy chicken an hour after leaving the place. we've been here twice and the Sheppard location twice within the past month.. and we can't get enough!  From reading the other posts, I understand it make not be authentic but honestly, I don't really mind because it's that good. Maybe one day i'll go to Korea and get the real deal lol  So far we've only tried the spicy chicken with rice cakes, yam, noodles, and cheese. I'm not too sure if I will ever get around to trying the other  things because i cannot get enough of the spicy chicken!  Come and give this place a try! It's def, worth the money =)  BTW it's CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Used to eat at Joons years ago. Went by today at lunch to take a stroll down memory lane. BIG MISTAKE !   When we arrived at the restaurant it was only about 15% full. We ordered simple lunch meals. Then we waited... and waited... and waited. 30 minutes go by and no food came. Not even the side dishes. We stopped a server and asked him how much longer for our meals, and he said 5 to .. maybe 10 more minutes. That was it. We asked to cancel our order and left. No apologies from the server, just a weird look when we left.  If you can't put out food in 30 minutes, do not open for lunch. Lunch crowd be warned. STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"Always got the Dak gal bee. Nice to have it once in a while.  My friend used to come here all the time but he said it's getting more expensive these days...."}
{"text":"The place is great for a group of friends to enjoy a communal meal. They have these stove top meals that (they) cook in front of you. The place is nice and comfy and has very friendly service.   Make sure that when you order the specialty to load it up with goodies. I recommend topping it up with cheese, veggies, yam, noodles and rice cake."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of tabletop cooking. The Chim Chae Soup( Kimchi Soup) is the best. I love their sour kimchi and when they make the soup its delicious. only downside is  there isn't that much veggie nor protein with it. granted it's only $6.50 but I wish they had options to add more pork/veggies"}
{"text":"Yay! A Korean restaurant that specializes in dak galbi. (VERY hard to find in North America.) You got my hopes up but your chicken sucked. Boo! And now I'm pissed.  Dak galbi is juicy pieces of dark meat chicken marinated in a mildly spicy sauce that you cook on the table top while knocking back beers and shooting the sh*t with friends. I have fond memories of eating it around Seoul and I've even had it in Chuncheon where the dish originated. So, yeah, my standards are high but not impossible.  I realize that Toronto is not Chuncheon or even Seoul, but the problems I have with Joons dak galbi have little to do with location or scarcity of ingredients.  So in the off chance that the management is reading my review, THIS IS WHY YOUR DAK GALBI BLOWS:  1. Wrong pan - Dak galbi is supposed to be cooked on a cast iron griddle so that you get a good sear on the meat. You use a stainless steel skillet which pools the marinade, and in effect, steams the chicken. Last time I checked, Canada has cast iron griddles.  2. Skinless chicken - Did you forget that fat = flavor? No skin = no fat = no flavor. Chicken comes with skin in Canada.   3. Skimped on veggies - Your dak galbi only comes with chopped cabbage. Where are the slices of sweet potato? Carrots? The onions and scallions?  Canada grows these vegetables. And they're pretty cheap.  4. No tteok - You charge extra for tteok (chewy rice cakes). This is not an add-in ingredient. Dak galbi comes pre-loaded with tteok. All of Korea and Wikipedia say so.  5. Bland fried rice - See, when you take away the aromatic vegetables, and the skin on the chicken, the resulting fried rice you make with the skillet drippings is going to lack flavor. (See #2.)  Most of your clientele is not-Korean. They've probably never had the real version so they don't know what they're missing. If that's how you want to make your mark on the culinary world (\"We make Korean food for people who don't know any better\"), that's your call. But remember that non-Koreans eat Korean food only once in a while. Don't forget who butters your bread every day.  Oh, and you're welcome."}
{"text":"I went there last weekend with my girlfriend, who is a big fan of korean food.  I'm not a fan, personally, but I was happy that she got to eat what she was craving.  The food was, to my understanding, quite good.  Food isn't the only thing needed, however.  Service has a lot to do with a restaurant experience.  Here is where this place fell short:  -once our food was served, we tried and tried to get a server's attention, as my girlfriend needed extra sauce.  We were unable to get their attention, and we tried.  The food was still good, but lacked the extra \"kick\" she was hoping to get.  One of the servers bumped into me quite hard, and never even apologized. I was loud enough to be heard, I was visibly ticked off.   Even if the food was good, the lack of customer care and empathy will make sure we'll never return.  Plenty of other options in Korea-town!"}
{"text":"i used to go to the one in downtown and this time i thought i will give their yonge location a try!!  ordered the chicken dakgalbee with their original joons sauce. and always its a must to add on cheese, ramen and ricecake!!! (MY FAVVVV!!!)   it was a little different as the dakgalbee was now cooked by a staff and brought to you instead of it being cooked right in front of you!! (there was a little area on one side of the restaurant where a staff is cooking all the dakgalbee orders). i didnt like that as i enjoyed taking part in the cooking process and watching it cooked right in front of me!!  the portions did seem smaller and the ramen ended up being overcooked. everything else was ok. maybe its just me but i find the downtown location tasted better!"}
{"text":"Been here numerous times since it's close to my work place, delicious as always. The taste and texture is very Korean authentic.   Came here with the wife today and ordered the chicken and seafood along with rice cake, noodle and mozzarella. Both of us were very full and satisfied with the dishes. Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Come for the table top set, left happy.  The table top set that we got was just chicken (there are different varieties) and you get to customize what goes in it (we got rice cake and mozzarella cheese).  The food was good, although it wasn't quick since they cook it in front of you (well, not really, there seemed to be a dining table that was dedicated to cooking it in the dining area).  The side dishes here are lacking compared to Nak Won, here you get broccoli, mashed potato, kim chi and radish.  None of which are memorable.  Cost was $27ish after taxes for two people.  I'd come back for the table top set again although the portion is not really that large, so you may want to add some more things."}
{"text":"A very average Korean casual restaurant. The service was quick and friendly. The food was adequate, but in the North York area there are many superior places. The prices are also about average for the area.  A very neutral experience."}
{"text":"Came here after work out. I a the first guest. The woman in service is really nice, kind of pushy though. She helped me with the pot and stopped me when I want to put cheese in it. There is a way of doing things. I ordered the chicken+noodle+cheese+cabbage. Kind of spicy, but taste good. It is not healthy, but people need junk food at some point.  The place is really cold, they say it is because they located in an old building.  The side dishes are fair. Nothing surprising.  I had to order 2 portions. It was huge, but I still finished it."}
{"text":"Dak Gal Bee is something everyone needs to try.  Its a mish mash of all things Korean and some pleasant surprises.  We got ours with chicken, rice cakes, instant noodles, and CHEESE!"}
{"text":"Food was good but not special. I saw images and I was excited to try it out from all the food reviews but it really just tasted like I had imagined."}
{"text":"This place destroyed my fondness for Korean food."}
{"text":"Had the Spicy Chicken (Dak Gal Bi) with noodles and sliced rice cakes.   The total came out to be about $11 per person before tax and tip.  Here is why i rated this restaurant very low:  1. The dish is called Spicy Chicken (Dak Gal Bi), but you barely get any. I think I counted about 7 small pieces per person. Maybe they should rename the dish... to Spicy Noodles with Chicken. Also the chicken was bland. I'm pretty sure it was not marinated, but rather raw chicken cooked first, then sauce added on top.  2. There were barely any other ingredients - not much cabbage, green onions, etc. The dish is predominantly Instant Noodles and rice cakes. This is fine and dandy, but for $11, it is not worth it at all. I mind as well make my own instant noodles for $1, and order KFC. You'll get alot more food.  3. Service was bad - I had to call for the waitress multiple times. I went on a Saturday night (9 PM), and the restaurant was only 33% full.  4. Before anyone judges my review as too critical, I'm Korean and I cook/order Dak Gal Bi frequently. Also normally you get alot more chicken and vegetables, with noodle as a side and not the main. If the instant noodles is the main, then $11 is a rip off."}
{"text":"The dak gal bee is quite good.  Not a place to go for fancy decor or attentive service, but good if you want to grab a quick bite of authentic Korean food (if you've been to Korea:  it's like any of the millions of low-end diners around, which isn't a bad thing)."}
{"text":"We went to Joons for lunch. We shared pork wonton and I got pork bone with clear broth soup and rice. It was good. They gave us free sides: kimchi, broccoli, mashed potatoes and carrots with turnips slices. Those were cold but good. 3/5 I would go back but I would also go to dozens of other restaurant too. I don't know any Korean anyway."}
{"text":"This place is the only place that makes the table cooking chicken good. Add cheese and noodle with is the best with the hot sauce. Must try. This place is not the cleanest place though but the good food makes up for it."}
{"text":"most important tip: GET ALL THE TOPPINGS OR SIDE OR WHATEVER THEY'RE CALLED...  when i came the first time, we only got noodle and rice cake and we were not full at all!!! so the second time, we got everything except for the rice and it was way more filling and way more worth the money. p.s don't expect good appetizers/side dish thingies, most korean restaurants give you like 5 or 6 appetizers side dishes but this one only gave 3 and they weren't that good, it didn't taste fresh, so i'd skip on those"}
{"text":"visited on tuesday night around 7pm for dinner. the place was packed and noisy. there were only 2 servers + owner lady? so the service was very slow (especially they have to cook the food for u at the table) . they were so busy and my order was confused but she apologized politely right away so we just ate our meal w/out complain. but i still prefer the downtown location. their food & service is better. and its really hot in the inner part of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Behind the black letters of \"Joons\" a neon orange background captures your attention to the Korean restaurant partially hidden beneath a flight of stairs.  Joons exemplifies good street advertising.    However, that's the extent of what their role modeling represents.  My afternoon lunch of Spicy Seafood Ramen ($6-7) and the house special Pork Short-Ribs (Galbi) on Rice ($12) totaled $20 including tip.  Side dishes barely achieved plurality consisting of a scoop of potato salad, some slices of precooked grounded fish, and kimchi.  The main courses were similarly below average; a big shrimp, a small shrimp, and a quarter of an octopus leg swam in my bowl unhindered by the listless noodles; over on the other side, there was galbi and there was rice.    Cheapest not necessarily the bestest.  However, Joons qualifies neither.  An average walk away in between both Bathurst and Christie station, the English menu and name of the restaurant somewhat helps the ostracized anglophones looking for quality Korean food.  It helps as much as the remedy the cash-only restaurant gives its customers, \"Help yourself... to our ATM.\""}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a group of friends as an alternative to Korean BBQ. Of our group of 6, one ordered Bibimbap, 3 of us shared the Dak Gal Bee and 2 shared Bulgogi. I wouldn't recommend coming with a group larger than 8, as even with 6 of us it was a bit awkward.  The table-top cooking experience was interesting, but the staff are very unobtrusive when they come by to give the ingredients a quick stir and make sure everything is cooking along as it should. We just kept on with our conversation and soon everything was ready to be eaten!  4 of us (including me!) are self proclaimed wusses when it comes to spicy food, and the Joon's original sauce was ok for the 3 having the Dak Gal Bee, but too much for one of my friends having the Bulgogi. I think it has to do with how much sauce they add at the beginning because as it cooks and reduces the sauce gets spicier. I found the spiciness enjoyable because it added a kick but wasn't uncomfortable. If my taste buds needed a break I would take a bite of the mashed potato side dish (yummy!).   After our Dak Gal Bee (chicken, veggies, with extras of rice sticks, sweet potato and seafood) was mostly done, our waitress added white rice and made a delicious fried rice dish on the wok using the remaining sauce. I think it was the best part of the meal!  Bibimbap tip: if you are not sure how spicy you like this dish, scoop out some of the hot sauce first. The put a lot in the dish and you are supposed to stir it all up before you eat, but my sister did that her first time and nearly died from spicy heat! It's much easier to add more than try to eat something that's burning your mouth.   My friends who have been down to Joon's on Bloor St. said that the menu here is smaller, however this was a fun restaurant with friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere. I'm personally not the biggest fan of spicy food, but if you like spicy Korean food this is definitely a spot to check out.  They only accept Debit, no credit cards. Washroom is located downstairs. There is limited parking behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"This has got to be flat-out one of the tastiest Korean places in Toronto.  Can get more than a bit crowded at times. The Dak gal bi is amazing and easily one of the most popular choices of this place. Pricing couldn't be better. 2 people can easily have a massive meal for approx. $24."}
{"text":"The dak galbi here is AMAZING.  Dak galbi is a dish of chicken and cabbage in a gochujang (Korean chili paste) based sauce. It's simmered on a tabletop burner until it's cooked and then your choice of toppings are added: we went for instant noodles, vegetables, rice cake and mozzarella cheese.  This isn't fancy or high-class food, it is Korean beer food at its finest... Salty, sweet, chewy, a little spicy (you can order more spicy or less spicy versions as you want, we ordered 'original'). The combination of cheese and spice was particularly delicious...for those who haven't tried it before I'd compare it to the savoriness of spaghetti bolognese with cheese on top. It was a really nice thing to eat on a winter night.  Joons serves plenty of other dishes (we also had the kimchi pancake, which was decent), but the dak galbi is the star. The environment isn't fancy at all, but it's pleasant and comfortable.  We were a group of 7 and paid $15 each including tip."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday and ordered the spicy chicken rice dish, kimchi fried rice, and pork bone soup to share for two. Food was tasty - new favourite is the spicy chicken they only serve during lunch.  I thought the customer service could have been a lot better though. All in all, a good place if you're craving Korean food!"}
{"text":"This is the best Korean dish I ever had. Never thought instant noodle and rice cakes would be that great pairing with spicy chicken. Recommend three portion of the chicken for party of two. Downside is that they don't take cards; had to run to the bank to get cash."}
{"text":"OMG. The food is bomb !!!! We ordered Ramen with chicken and cheese. I just can't get over the fact that Melted cheese was so good on the ramen and chicken. We also order Tofu Soup. If you did not try Tofu soup, you have to try it. It's a little spicy but just a kick to wake you up from all the cheese you are consuming. Customer service was amazing. We went there for dinner but it was not that busy. It took a little while to get your food but we were chatting so we didn't even notice how time pass. In general, I would give 5 star because the food was nice, the service was relatively good, the place is clean and there is a pay parking at the back of the store which makes it a little easier commute."}
{"text":"I went to Joon's after reading the rave reviews. It's the only place I've found so far that also serves Dak Gal Bee in similar fashion to the way it's prepared in Korea.  The food was fantastic, the service could have been better. We had to ask for water more than once, and the waitress had trouble understanding our order because English wasn't her first language. Then again, I guess you can't expect it ALL at an authentic Korean restaurant in Koreatown.  My only disappointment was that they wouldn't mix the rice in with the chicken, the way it's supposed to be! It could also be because the waitress couldn't understand me."}
{"text":"Joon's is well known for their dakgalbi, spicy chicken that is cooked right in front of you with rice cakes and veggies. The only downside to Joon's is that they only take cash so make sure you bring cash with you if you're going! You can add ramen to add with your chicken as well which I would recommend because just the chicken alone won't be filling enough. You can also ask for rice when you are done with the chicken and they will mix it with sesame oil and the leftover sauce. My favourite end to the meal."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Joons Cuisine: Korean Location: North York Address: 4852 Yonge St Price Range: $10~15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4 Service: 3 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  * Many items for 2 people minimum * 2 locations (North York & Christie) * Vegetarian option Avail   I love table-top cooked dishes, they are the best because you share same thing with everyone...which means no crying over who ordered a better dish. But really, it's fun with table-top cooked dishes because you can add things depending on what you order and they make you fried rice at the end.  Table-top cooked dishes are quite common in Korea, they are usually very cheap and easy to find in small neighbourhoods and people usually enjoy them as a meal or to eat with soju. Last time I was in Korea, I had Dak-Gal-Bee in MyungDong and it was so delicious...I can still dream about it. It's pretty damn spicy and yes, you smell like you showered in the sauce after- but you just have to deal with it if you want to experience good Korean food!  Ordered: Dak-Gal-Bee (JS-1) 4/5  * Chicken (boneless dark meat) and assorted vegetables (cabbage, sweet potato and greeon onion)  * Choose your spiciness (we went with B. The Joons Original Spicy Sauce) * $9.25 per portion (2 portions minimum), we ordered 3 portions for 3 people * Extra Add On: rice cake, mozzarella cheese, instant noodle, vegetables and fried rice * Extra add ons are all $2 except the fried rice * Everything is thrown together and comes to your table uncooked * Because it's chicken, they take a while to fully cook and it drives you crazy * Servers will come around and cook them for you so don't worry about the process * If you order mozarella cheese, they come midway and add it on near the end * For 3 portion order, I found there weren't much chicken * Original spicy sauce is not spicy at all!! If I say it's not spicy...it's really not spicy * I didn't like the mozarella cheese, it had weird texture and it took away the spiciness of the dish * Instant noodles were good after it soaked up all the sauce * When you are 80% done, ask for your rice to be cooked and they will do it for you * I love the crispy bottom part of the rice   Summary: I would go back to Joons, but would order things differently. I would get the Suicidal spicy sauce (although it sounds scary, Original spicy is not spicy at all) and would skip the mozarella cheese. Also, keep in mind that once you start adding extra things, your bill will end up higher than you expect...but again, since when was Korean food cheap in Canada? Overall I enjoyed the food here and the service is decent. Would def go back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the beef and seafood table stirring. It wasn't bad. Service was a bit slow, and could've given us a bit more than what we got. Taste was ok, pretty good restaurant for a quick and easy meal."}
{"text":"This is a secret favourite place.  When there is seating available and the stove top tables are free, it's like winning the lottery.  The service is friendly, quick, and they refill your little sides.    My staple to get is the chicken dakgalbi, with vegetables, and RICE CAKES! I always get two servings of cheese.  There is just the perfect amount of ingredients versus the sauce.  At the other location, I just feel there isn't enough sauce.    My only wish is that they would accept Interac but I don't know if that's changed."}
{"text":"Very nice and affordable meal for two people! I went with a friend and we ordered two portions of the chicken dish with the teriyaki sauce. Additional ramen, cheese and rice cakes were added! Very delicious and it also came with the typical side dishes that most Korean restaurants provide!"}
{"text":"The good reviews brought me to this place but I didn't get it. The table top experience was interesting, they place a pile of raw food in a pan on a cooker and come by occasionally to stir it for you. Why not just cook it in the kitchen?   The taste of the food was at least 3 stars, it loses a star because of the small portions (no one should leave a restaurant hungry), and because I literally had to wash all my clothes the next day to get rid of the heavy onion smell (likely from all the cooking around you)."}
{"text":"First question that pops into my head upon entering Joons is: Why in the world is it so dark and depressing in here?  In addition to the lack of lighting in this North York location, the servers here aren't too friendly either.  We ordered the only thing at Joons that they're famous for - Dak Gal Bee - and this dish is served in a large pan with the ingredients cooked at the table, so be prepared to wait awhile to eat, which is tortuous for incredibly hungry patrons.   The Dak Gal Bee was delicious just like their downtown location. You have to pay $2.00 extra for each topping you want added (ie. rice cake, mozzarella cheese, rice, noodles). There are also three levels of spiciness to choose from. Having tried all three, I have to say the \"Original Spicy\" is the way to go!   We ordered three servings for the chicken Dak Gal Bee. Though there was a generous portion of chicken in the pot, our added-on rice cake and noodles were minimal, not enough for all three people to share.   I will definitely return, but only to their downtown location."}
{"text":"Note: this review is only based on seafood items on their menu.  So, my SO and I ended up at Joon's last night in an attempt to try somewhere new in good ol' Koreatown.  Walking in, we were greeted and could smell the delicious korea cuisine in the air.  Service was slow, we were only approached a few times after we ordered and had to get the attention of our server.    As for food, we ordered the following: a) Veggie japche - it tasted like japche, but it was under seasoned and the vegetables were oddly (large sliver of onion) b) Seafood pancake - it was bland and there was no yummy korean red sauce provided c) Shrimp bimimbap - it looked a bimimbap but did not taste like one, it was underwhelming   Overall, we were very unimpressed with service and quality of food.  To top off the experience,  payment was cash or debit card only.  Feel to check out Joon's for the meat options on their menu.  Unfortunately, I likely will be not be back as there are better eats in the Koreatown area."}
{"text":"Dak galbi (marinated chicken stir-fry on hot plate - traditionally dark meat chicken is used, but I don't know what kind they use here) is their specialty but a la carte menu is offered too.  banchan has the usual napa cabbage kimchi, beansprouts, but the one i especially like is their simple but good steamed broccoli with a dash of gochujang. personally i like gochujang with everything, but it may not be fore everyone. they also have a mashed potato banchan which i did not try.  if your order the dak galbi, i recommend extra orders of tteok (rice cake sticks), sweet potato and pumpkin. cheese (looks and tastes like mozzarella) is offered too, giving it a fusion/modern twist. ramen is also on the menu.   service is attentive, friendly and pleasant.   quite a roomy restaurant, which is surprising if you merely look from the outside. unlike many other korean restaurants in toronto, you can actually linger here for a while, given enough seating for everyone.  will DEFINITELY come again."}
{"text":"Good little Korean place at Yonge and Sheppard. We went as a group of 7 and ordered 5 portions of the cheesey chicken with add ons of rice cake, more cheese and ramen.   I love the flavor cause it's spicy enough without me having to drink water after every bite. One thing is.... Lots of cabbage in the dish. I don't mind cause I love cabbage but my friend was picking then out and he had a bowl full of them lol   Service was a bit slow even though it wasn't that busy. We asked for a refill on side dishes which took a long time to arrive and we had to ask 3 times. It also takes a while for the dishes to arrive so this wouldn't be a good place to go if you're in a rush.   Prices are okay and the food is okay good. Nothing really wowed me but I would go back for some cheesey chicken and noodles if I was in the area."}
{"text":"i wasn't too thrilled that when i found out my cousins ordered the chicken with the cheese on top, but it turned out to be pretty good. the best part is, when you think you're full, you order rice so you can mix it with the leftovers. it's definitely not the healthiest thing you can eat, but good for when you want to see your thighs get bigger."}
{"text":"Joons is a great option for Korean dak galbi.  Staff are friendly, prices are reasonable and the food is tasty and fresh.  Dak galbi is a chicken dish cooked in a shallow pan at your table.  The staff takes care of all the cooking - you just order and wait for it to complete.  You buy the chicken dish and then buy additional add-ons (veggies, sweet potato, rice, rice cake, ramen and cheese).  For two people, the meal with all add-ons it costs around $25.  The resulting dish is a nice stew of meat, veggies and rice in a thick Korean pepper based sauce.  The last step is to sprinkle the cheese on and enjoy the tasty goodness.  Our experience at Joons was great - will definitely go back and try other menu items.  Their hot pot also looks good."}
{"text":"Disappointment !! After hearing so many people hyping about this restaurant, I decided to try it out.  1.) no parking 2.) the chicken in our noodle tasted like they cooked last week and reheated (awful) 3.) overpriced, you have to add many toppings because the one pan doesn't come with anything. Each topping costs double because it's for 2 people and we didn't even get that much food. 4.) the restaurant is pretty dead, when me and my husband walked inside, there was zero customers inside on a weekend night during dinner time !! 5.) their washrooms are in the basement with very very very steep stairs. Hope you fix that before a lawsuit comes one day."}
{"text":"First of all, the service was slow to the extreme! It took us about 10 mins to finally get the server's attention that we're ready to order. We ordered DakGalBee hot pot as our base and we also ordered cheese, noodles, etc with it by adding a few dollars.  The taste of the food is just okay, nothing special that makes me wanna return to the restaurant. But if you walk further up North, there are even more better taste Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"I first chose to go to this place because it had pretty good reviews on Yelp. But after going I am not impressed at all by any aspect of the store. I am disappointed. That one sentence along summarizes how i feel about Joon.  First off, the restaurant is small, crowded and as a result very hard to get seats. This isn't a big problem, since most korean restaurants aren't that big. However, what i was shocked about was we received only 3 appetizer dishes. And they were tiny too, this is my first time receiving so little appetizer dishes. I usually get at least 5 dishes minimal between me and one other person. But that night when i went to Joon's i was with 2 other people, and still we had to share 3 little dishes. That is just cheap. Thirdly, the food wasn't even that good. Me and my two other friends didn't even really like our food. I always order the pork bone soup and most restaurants allow me to adjust the spice level.  I didn't get to choose the spice level at Joon's, so it was very spicey. Not only that, it didn't even taste that good, i definitely had better. I've been to several korean restaurants in Chinatown and Korean town, i've noticed a pattern, not only are the restaurants in Chinatown better in customer service, there's more room and the prices are either the same or lower."}
{"text":"I usually do not review much or complain much for that matter. But I feel I need to say something.   I entered this restaurant and was directed to sit down. No hello No good evening. I should have taken the welcome or lack of one as a sign.   When the menu was placed in front of me I was given 30 seconds to order. I felt rushed and pressured.   So I ordered my dish then before I can continue my beverage and app order she took a step away as if she's in a rush and I'm slowing her down.   Long story short she got my order wrong. I knew she got my order wrong because she gave me no time of day to listen to me and to allow me to properly order.   When I proceeded to tell her my order was wrong she said I don't need to pay for it if I don't like it.   All this while the owner just stood there cooking her lunch on a portable grill.   I am not expecting the world when it comes to food and service In a Asian quick service restaurant but this was ridiculous.   Joons is great for a hearty well priced quick meal. But not if you wish to be treated like crap.   I ended up paying for my meal and leaving a tip while the owner and waitress swore and complain about me.   That's very noble and nice Joons. Great way to treat your customers."}
{"text":"I like the food there, come here on many occasions but last occasion I lost my appetite from seeing 2 bugs climbing on the wall so close to my face.   Cleanliness not very good."}
{"text":"During university, I used to go to the Joons location in Koreatown at least once a month. Having moved to the North York area, I loved being closer to this location.  Atmosphere: Very casual, good for large groups as well as quick dinners.  Service: Usually adequate, they can rush you if it's busy. On my last visit, they didn't rush us out of our table, but it did feel like they needed the serving ware (large pan to used for the Dak Gal Bi) back. They do accepts credit cards.  Food: My order is usually the same, Dak Gal Bi with ramen, sweet potato, rice cake and cheese. The orders aren't cooked at your table anymore and instead the server uses a nearby empty table. The large pan is served already cooked and ready to eat. Side dishes are standard of kimchi, bean sprouts, turnip and mashed potato. I do like the mashed potato a lot as it's sweet.  For the Dak Gal Bi, the chicken, cabbage and base are very flavourful. I wish they were more generous with the toppings as it seems like I could always eat more of the ramen or rice cake. Maybe I'm just too slow and my fellow diners have already scooped them up.  The Dak Gal Bi has a minimum of 2 orders/pan. I find if you're not ordering anything else, 1 order/person is just right."}
{"text":"We're starting explore the restaurants at yonge and sheppard now that my finance works there and thought i'd give this place a try. The food was not bad, tasty but I would probably not go back if I had a choice. Here is why:  At a glance Price: $$ Rating: 3  Details:  Atmosphere/ Décor: 2 Meh... Nothing special, the place is not decorated at all, minimum effort. Reminds me of an old fast food restaurant.  Service: 2.5 Service was very mediocre.  There were 2-3 girls working in the front and approximately 3-5 more tables of 2-4 people during our time there and food still took FOREVER to get to us. Water was quick, but everything else including side dishes took forever. Considering that it was not a very busy night and it still took a while, i can't imagine the service when it is busy.   Food:  3.5 The taste was alright. We ordered two orders of DakGalbee. Their min. was 2 orders which i found kind of stupid because i definitely wanted to try other things as well but didn't want too much food. When the food came, my finance's first reaction was is that one order or two? (I'm sure you can imagine the portion now) For the price of $12.50 for one order it was definitely not worth it. It only includes chicken and cabbage. We had added ramen and cheese($2 each) and even with those added, the dish was tiny. The side dishes was very mediocre- We had kimchi, potato (very good and creamy), radish and broccoli.   Overall: The food was okay, not worth it though for the price we paid. We paid over $30 including tips and for what we had- it was not worth it. We haven't tried DakGalBee in Toronto yet but we ate quite a bit of it when we were in Korea and can't compare."}
{"text":"I went here because it was close by and based on some of the reviews, I thought it would be worth a shot.  The Dak Gal Bee was okay at best and really not that satisfying.  The place is very casual and the service is okay.  All in all it wasn't very memorable and it doesn't really make me want to go back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night after encountering long lineups at at nearby restaurants, came here and the restaurant wasn't busy at all, in hindsight probably should have clued in at that time.  We ordered two orders of spicy chicken & seafood with cheese and rice cake add on, and with their signature joons spicy sauce, as well as an order of soon do boo.   It took a while for the food to come out, and the small side dishes were of super tiny portions and lacked variety. They also did not come before the meal like most other Korean restaurants and came with the main...we were already starving ! Weird backwards Korean cuisine imo  The spicy chicken and seafood was disappointing, the dish came out luke warm, and cooled down really quickly. The ingredients also only constituted a very thin layer in the pan.. literally covered only 2cm of it. There was no heating element underneath to keep it warm, the chicken taste was mediocre at best and not very tender and I cant really tell the difference between the regular spicy sauce and their signature join spicy sauce.   Soon tofu was also average, in taste.    Bottom line: definitely made a mistake coming here, will not come back again"}
{"text":"Coréen authentique vu la clientèle essentiellement composée d'asiatiques et coréens bien sûr. VOus pourrez commander le célèbre bibimbap mais ici le plat à commander est le special chicken, sorte de grande poêle à chauffer au centre de la table accompagnée de légumes.  Authentic korean restaurant judging by the number of asian customers and korean for sure. You can order the famous bibimbap but the must order dish here is the special chicken, sort of huge plate with vegetables that you will heat in the center of the table."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while now since my best friend loves the mixed food in a big pot concept (galbee?) here. My mom and I had to walk out because we found it very pricey for two people, so this time we enlisted one more person to go with us.  For starters, the minimum order is 2 and each option (chicken, chicken and seafood, pork and baby octopus or beef and baby octopus) ranges from $13.50-14.50ish. We got the beef with baby octopus which is the most expensive one, with the original joons spicy sauce. I should also mention that you can't mix and match which is a big let down. Each add on (e.g. we got ramen noodles, cheese, rice cakes) is 2.25 Each, more or less depending on what you get.   Presentation is cool but honestly the taste was very underwhelming. The flavour was just very monotone, everything tasted the same and had a very strong old cabbage bitter flavour.  At the end with tax and tip I paid about $45.  You're paying a lot for very simple and cheap ingredients with your hard earned money. What I am trying to say is, you can make something similar for way cheaper and taste wayyy better.  I won't be coming back here again if I had the choice. Sorry Joons.  Food - 1.5/5 Atmosphere - 4/5 Service - 3/5"}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent portions! I honestly don't remember much else because the cheese was divine and I slipped into a slight euphoric state of being. How did I not know such a dish existed? A combination of my toboki, cheese, kimchi served in a giant dish - yes please!!!!  Service was to be expected from an establishment such as this.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is good but you need to add to order the additional toppings to make it really good. Portions aren't large so people can think that it's expensive. I find the chicken moist and tender so I like that.   There's parking in the back but very very limited amounts. Be prepared to pay for street parking."}
{"text":"This one's a meh. This one's a nah. Really not up to snuff. And still, something to sneeze at."}
{"text":"been going there since it opened on yonge.  love their Dak Gal Bee ( table cooking of spicy chicken with veggies) don't forget to add rice cake, yam n double cheese!! Hearty comfort food for me! n the mash potato side dish is so yummy too!  towards the end when u only have a bit of chicken n pieces of veggies left in ur pan, you can ask them to make fried rice with it. they will bring over rice, hot sauce/sesame oil mixture n mix it all up for u. the owner lady even formed the rice into a heart shape for me n my boyfriend one time. it was too cute~!  the Dak Gal Bee is so good there, every time we go that's all we get. so i don't know how the other items on the menu taste.  oh and the minimum order for Dak Gal Bee is 2 people portions.  service is fine, waitresses are pleasant, but sometimes don't speak much English, but who cares, food's good!"}
{"text":"original chicken dak galbi with sticky rice cake and cheese next time we should double the cheese and ricecake!! very spicy delicious for chili days"}
{"text":"I love this place, but it's only good to go during winter time. Summer is too hot in there. Food is great!"}
{"text":"This isn't the first time I ate at Joons, but it would definitely be my last. The only reason I still eat there despite its horrible service and selection of appetizer is because of their table cooking. I'll admit, I like their table cooking selections (I personally go for the chicken one) and along with that I always add a few side dishes to add to it. My typical selection is cheese, noodles x2 since we have two people and sweet potato. As usual, I ordered this except this time the waiter told me in half-understandable English that I can only order one noodle, even if I want to pay extra for it. Okay? So you don't want my money? And what kind of policy is it to not let customer order what they like? Fine, I got over that since it's not such a big deal. As usual, the appetizers did not come until nearly 20 minutes later. And no, asking them for it would not make it any faster. Infact, they had it on the counter all along but still didn't want to give it to you. I can confidently say this is their way of doing things because all four times I went, things never improved. The appetizers consist of: two pieces of broccoli, half a scoop of potato, some kimchi and a few beans. Every time I see it it just makes me not want to go back. Onto the horrendous main course that used to be good: Table Cooking. We decided to try something new today: Tofu Table Cooking. Everything seemed normal until we took a bite at the tofu, it was incredibly sour, not what a NON-EXPIRED tofu should taste like. YUCK! There is a saying that restaurants that are afraid of letting customers eat would not stay open for long, as they oppose the fundamentals of even opening a restaurant. DEFINITELY not recommended!"}
{"text":"I just love this place.  I take everyone I know here and we always try the Dak gal bi.  I tried to make my own at home - but it's just the same. Please try it! (with noodles, cheese and rice noodles)  Service is fast, good - cash only. Easy to locate, get off at Bathurst station and walk for a couple minutes.  It's a \"no frills\" place so don't expect fancy decor.  Prices are reasonable (wish the Dak gal bi didn't charge $2 for noodles though....but I'll pay it cuz it's that good).  Gyozas are good too!"}
{"text":"Let me just spare you the details and time and just tell you I got food poisoning after eating here."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time today and it was meh. My first major complaint would be the heat as the place lacks adequate air conditioning. Other than the two ceiling fans and the one small air conditioner near the entrance, I found it to be very humid and this ruined the experience for me. The menu also seems to have changed since the last time I was there (a couple of months ago). The dakgalbi dishes now require you to place a minimum of 2 orders per dish, which can be quite pricey, considering the popular add ons - rice cakes, noodles and cheese, are an additional ~$2 each. Portions are also slightly on the smaller size for the price you pay.  The servers were pleasant but service in general was a little slow. We didn't get our appetizers until we asked them (30 minutes after we ordered) and it took about 40 minutes for us to get our food... the place wasn't even packed!  Overall, I'd say, if you haven't tried this place before, then it might be worth checking out. However, the service could be better and the restaurant itself could be a lot cooler!"}
{"text":"The JS-2 Dak Gal Bee (chicken & seafood) was what I ordered in this visit.  I think ordering Ramen noodles will definitely spice up your experience for this restaurant, because I can't imagine any other way eating this without noodles.  The environment is cozy and tight, and by tight I mean I have difficulty getting in and out of the booths.. and I am not even a fat guy.  I believe any order you place, they'll give you free sides, which are: potatoes, reddish, kim chi, & broccoli. The Dak Gal Bee in general tasted decent and fresh!   I recommend you to order the top 3 add-ons for an additional $2.00 each; they are: rice cakes, cheddar, & Ramen noodles.  Overall, this is a cute cozy little restaurant with decent tasting food to eat at on a cold winter night!"}
{"text":"Where should I begin..  I came here for their famous ramen dish. The restaurant is tight-spaced and pact however, the wait in line was decent and took about 10 - 15 mins. Let's get to the point now. The food. It was great. I guess it depends on what toppings you add on but I find that cheese can make most things taste that much better. to be honest,  I am not a ramen or any kind of instant noodle fan. I try to avoid them as much as possible but the images my friends sent me of this place kind of sparked my curiosity. You basically get a pan of ramen which can be shared between 2-3 people depending how many other toppings you add. I feel that once you add them up, it can cost quite a bit. I got the cheese, rice cake, fish cake, veggies and extra ramen for this ramen dish and it was shared among two people. Definitely filled both of us. I think if many of my friends like ramen, I'll come back with them. Only downside is that the ramen was a tad dry. I wish they had more sauce. Other than that, I probably will not come here myself. But definitely had a good experience with an average friendly service."}
{"text":"We came.  We ate Dak Gai Bee.  We were stuffed and satisfied.  That orange glow, goopy cheese and instant noodle can't be all that good for you, but man, we ate well!  We came with Korean friends who ordered everything and they did not lead us wrong.  It took a while to cook but I guess that just led to some interesting conversation while we were waiting.  Free parking in the back on specific spots if there is any left.  You can enter from the back door as well from the parking lot.  Otherwise, park at the Green P which is right behind the free restaurant spots."}
{"text":"We ordered two orders of the chicken plus extra mozzarella cheese, ramen and rice cake. One beef soup. The portion is good for three girls and we also pack the leftover home.  Very Korean and spicy flavour. I like the ramen and cabbage very much! Right, potato salad is awesome."}
{"text":"I find Korean food a bit hit and miss with my tastes. There are certain things I absolutely love and can't get enough of, then there are things I try once and never want to have again.  I tried the Korean army stew thing, that has ramen, luncheon meat and other stuff in it. I wasn't a huge fan of this. It basically just tasted like the same thing I make at home. My friend went crazy for it.  Service was friendly and the atmosphere was quite nice. I'd like to return and try some of my favourite dishes.  There's a couple of parking spots at the back for free, and a paid lot at the back as well."}
{"text":"Used to love going to this place. Went so often that one of the staff recognized my kids. unfortunately, this time wasn't a good experience. I usually order the daegalbee with noodles, cheese, and rice cakes. Its a dish that everyone loves. This time around, it was a different experience. The service was ok, but the food wasn't good at all. The cabbage was undercooked, so was the rice cakes. Over all, had a lot better experience before. I'm not sure if I will be going back.   Pro  Unlimited side dishes (the mashed potatoes are awesome)  Con  Some of the food was undercooked or extremely hard. We had a hard time with the cabbage and I assume the carrots."}
{"text":"This is the closest Korean restaurant to my place so I frequent here quite a bit due to convenience. I like their pork bone soup and typically get take out. The wait can be awhile so I usually call ahead of time for takeout. They recently raised the prices a bit but still reasonable for the soups. I know that they are known for their sticky noodles. I personally think that the noodles are a bit overrated and quite overpriced when you consider the add-ons. All the add-ons are not expensive ingredients, but the price can definitely add up per person. If you don't do the add ons, then you don't really have much of a dish. If it's not out of convenience for me, I would prefer venturing down to Yonge and Finch for better Korean food options (at a tad better price points)."}
{"text":"The first time I had Joons was on Bloor a couple of years ago with one of my best friends. I remember it being one of the best experiences I've ever had with food because we came in on a cold winter day and the food was piping hot and smelled delicious.  I've been to this location of Joon's before and I've had similar experiences, however, this time around, I think I have to reconsider what I think of Joon's.  I always order the Dak Gal Bee (JS1 or JS2, $12.50 and $13.25 per order) and there's a minimum order of 2. I always choose the Joon's original spicy sauce (decently spicy) and add rice cakes, cheese and ramen noodles. If I'm feeling especially hungry, I'll throw in a fried rice. All of these come at an add on price, ranging from $2.00 -$2.75.  For two people, we spent $38 after tips and taxes. For that price I think we could have had a much better meal in the area. I'm quite disappointed at how much I paid for... for a pack of ramen noodles and cheese with sauce.  I don't think I'll be returning soon...."}
{"text":"If you come here, you need to get their dak gal bi which is table cooking chicken. But if you like other korean stuff like pork bone soup or whatever, they have those too. This place gets packed pretty quickly on a busy day so be prepared to wait.   dak gal bi is $9.25 per portion but you need to order a minimum of 2 portions. Table cooking isn't really meant for an individual. It's for 2 or more people. The $9.25 is the basic which includes the chicken, sauce, and some veggies. You'll probably need to top it off with some extras like rice cake, ramen, or rice. Some of these extras are cooked within the pot.   Like other reviewers said, I find their portions smaller than I expected. But it's not a major thing as it's only slightly smaller than expected. With 2 people you should get some extras if you don't want to be hungry afterwards.   i like how you can specify the spiciness. If you don't ask, they will give you default which is not very spicy at all.   Overall it's a solid place for the dak gal bi. I haven't tried other things of the few times I've been here."}
{"text":"We've ordered Chicken and seafood dakagalbi with extra cheese and ramen. The sauces they made for the dish was really good. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday and there were still seats available. Had 3 portions of the seafood dakgalbee with Joons sauce (B) and mozzarella cheese and ramen. If you like even more spice you can add it for +$0.50.  Servers are really friendly, they used to let you cook your own dakgalbee at the table, but not anymore. I think this diminishes the appeal of the dish a little bit, but if you've never had it you should try it. If you have had it, you might be a little disappointed.   For the three of us, it came close to $18/person, so not really the best value."}
{"text":"Came here because of all the hype for their dak galbi and was extremely disappointed. We ordered the original dak galbi and it was digustingly sweet. All we could taste was the sugar, it was so overpowering and nasty. I don't get how this place get good reviews? Maybe the other location is better but I don't want to go back after that experience. The sided dishes werent much better either. Everything was just overly sweet it felt like I was eating dessert instead of dinner. GROSS."}
{"text":"As of lately joons has become the top Korean restaurant that I wanted to try because of the delicious photos of the dak-galbis that have been circling the internet! After having tried the dak-galbi for the first time I can now honestly say that it is very much worth all the hype that I've been told about!! I love the combination of noodles with rice cake and the stringy goodness of the melted mozarella cheese!!!! I don't know how anyone could ever turn down a dish like this."}
{"text":"I'm quite new to Korean cuisine so excuse me if I sound a little dumb or something. So apparently it's very typical for guests who come to this restaurant to order the Dak Galbi (according to le server).   I found it a little stupid that you are required to buy two servings when you order any of their Dak Galbi... Why don't they just list the double serving price instead of a single serving price so not to confuse anyone...   Other than that little odd revelation, food was delicious, vibes were relaxed, and customer service was pleasing! I wouldn't say it's ridiculous pricing but I do think it was a little more expensive than, say, a chinese restaurant. Again... a complete Korean cusine Newbie who knows nothing of average pricing on these things.   Overall, great place if you're really hungry and looking for a large quantity of tasty, quality food. I was stuffed by the end. OH and the food is cooked on a small gas stove placed right in front of you so it cooks while you grab at the pot.  FYI if you enjoy those types of things!"}
{"text":"Damn the cold noodles here are the bomb.  Came here for lunch. Got the korean cold noodles. It was the best ever. They cut the noodles right in front of you after they put the bowl on the table The soup was super tasty, with a lot of ice still in it--talk about Cold :) The boiled egg looked spotless. The marinated pear had a lot of flavor even when fold. And the noodles were chewy yes yes!  The inside of the place is pretty normal. Cozy atmosphere, kept clean, with wooden tables. The waiter is a old lady that looked like a mom with an apron. Kind of felt like going to a friend's house and their mom cooks for you.  Overall, definitely go here more often!"}
{"text":"Came back again tonight for dinner. Still a good staple place for dakgalbi, with cheese, ramen, and rice cakes being necessary add ons to make it an awesome meal. Delicious and foresee to be a regular for a long time.  Service is always good here. No problems paying by credit card and cash split. Free gum pieces for afterwards is a nice touch.  Total was just under $19 per person after everything. Wish it was slightly less expensive. Especially since visiting Seoul this summer where you can get this for dirt cheap, miss it but this is the best in Toronto for me."}
{"text":"I got the Original Spicy Dakgalbee and added noodles, rice cake and mozzarella. It was sooo goood. It's required that you order two portions and you can't mix and match (ex: 1 order of chicken 1 order of beef), but it's ok!! It's still pretty cheap and it's good enough to share. Came in super hungry and thought we didn't order enough food and was thinking of getting a side of kimchi rice but good thing we didn't because the 2 orders of spicy dakgalbee was enough! Definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"We order he big dish and it was pretty good. The pork bone soup wasn't good because it wasn't hot enough. The kimchi fried rice was pretty good. The side dish was too small since we have 11 people. The funny thing is they want us to finish all the seed weed before they could give us a knew one. That was disappointing because one of the seed weed wasn't finish because it was on other table with us. It just a normal restaurant where nothing really special to me."}
{"text":"Ate here with some coworkers who were craving Korean food while we were in Toronto for business. I couldn't remember ever eating at a Korean restaurant, and I'm having trouble remembering exactly what he had, but I remember it being tasty and I tried some of everyone's food. I had a fried rice dish with beef and vegetables that was a little spicy but good. My coworker had some kind of dish served in a round kettle where everything was separated :rice, meat, vegetables, etc but then you are supposed to mix it all together. It was quite good. My other two coworkers had the meal for 2 that is cooked right at your table (hot plate is IN the table) and their dish was dark meat chicken and vegetables. I tried a bite and it was tasty. Service was really nice and for 4 of us the bill came to about $45 CAD. I was pretty satisfied w/ the place and would recommend it for lunch."}
{"text":"Caveat: I haven't ordered any of the two-person dishes, like the dak galbi. Those could very well be amazing.  Other than that, this place is solid but not notable in any way. The location is very convenient, the banchan are pretty good (love the radish and potato salad here), and the food is served hot and quickly. Everything is good, but it's pretty standard and I wouldn't say anything warrants more than a 3-star review. I think there are better places in the area (Huh Ga Ne, Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu) but this is not a bad option at all.  Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Make sure u come in on a weekday to get not so rushed service though"}
{"text":"be prepared to smell like korean bbq or some kinda oily meat smell when you come out of the place, all your clothes, hair and everything will smell. Horrible ventilation in here.  I always get the table top cooking (now they cook it away from you at another table all together and than bring it over) before it used to be cooked on our table. I like all the options! especially tons of CHEESE with instant noodles? YUM! bad part is that the veggies is no really good or much variety. and you can only order one order of instant noodles, even if you want more and want to add money? no way. Of course after we are still hungry, so usually we turn whatever is left over into fried rice. The lady will bring the rice and sauce and cook it in front of us. Than we will be fully stuffed up to our necks :)   the side dishes are not bad either."}
{"text":"It's smart they didn't bring BOWLS out to us first.  If they did I'm pretty sure my Friend would have started grabbing at the Dak Gal Bee prior to safe edibility while the Staff comes over to check on the doneness or replace the Gas Canister on our Portable Stove.  Yeah, some of my Friends are willing to risk Salmonella they're that hungry and rushed.  JS2 [Chicken & Seafood(Shrimp, Mussel, Squid) Dak Gal Bee]   Add-on: Rice Cake($2.00) + Steam Rice($1.75?)  First, due to the Pan that the Dak Gal Bee($10+/portion) is cooked on.  It was difficult to see if our Pan had 2-portions or 3-portions(chosen).  I looked across to the Pan of a couple young Men(2-portions) and looked approximately the same as ours.  I'm thinking that on average we can blow through 1.5 - 2.0 portions per person.  That's probably why the young Men next to us ordered Soon Tofu as well.  If you are eating solely Dak Gal Bee only:  1 Hungry Patron    =  2-portions 2 Hungry Patrons  =  3-portions  Another option is add ALL the add-ons(Rice Cake, Noodle, etc...) which would total about the same price as an individual Dak Gal Bee portion.  So the question to the Hungry, do you want more MEAT or more Noodle/Rice?  As for the Dak Gal Bee itself, considering this as a homestyle Korean meal that includes Chicken(Meat), Cabbage/Scallions(Vegetable), Gochujang, it satisfies the basic needs of the average growing Teen.  The Dish itself is 1-dimension in terms of Flavour(Gochujang) but I guess that's the idea behind this Easy-to-Prepare Meal.  We chose the Joon's Original Spicy which was perfect median level spice.  The thing I like about the Dish is the Squid Tentacles, Dark Meat Chicken, chewy Rice Cake while I was a bit disappointed that each of us only received a single Mussel as well as Shrimp.  Depending on how much you love Gochujang, you might enjoy the leftover Gochujan Concoction.  I see why they say MINIMUM 2 portion because that's probably my standard portion size when I visit next time."}
{"text":"Favourite Korean joint! I love the dakgakbi(joons special) chicken version. It's basically chicken veggies and their famous sauce in one pan. You have to order a minimum of 2 orders. You can also add sides, I recommend adding the ramen, cheese and rice cakes. Perfect for 2 people. If you come with a party of 4 I would recommend ordering separate orders as I find the portion not as much. The joons special is awesome and full of flavour. They also give a few side dishes( kimchi, beans, mash (super creamy and sweet- always get seconds) I have also tried their pork bone soup and kimchi fried rice- not a big fan I think it lacks flavour. Overall, I would recommend this place and to order the special!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I went to the one downtown and realized there was one closer to me *YESSSS!.   It's pretty decent on price and the chicken/seafood option is pretty good actually, so I wouldn't just stick with the chicken all the time.  This option had chicken, mussels, cabbage, squid and shrimp mixed in. We added noodles, cheese and rice cakes and it was yummy :) The spice is perfect, enough to clear your sinuses, but not sweat profusely from the heat :p  The downside I can think of is that service is a bit slow and the add ons (rice cakes, noodles, cheese, rice etc) are extra."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourite Korean restaurants to go to in the area. I absolutely love the Joons Special - Dak Gal Bee!! This is also what Joons is pretty much known for, so if you're there, you've got to try it!  I recommend getting the Seafood Dakgalbee, which comes with chicken (boneless dark meat), assorted seafood (baby octopus, shrimp, mussels), and cabbage. Tastes so so SO good!!! A downside to the Dakgalbee order is that you have to order at least 2 portions, so you can't really get an individual sized meal for this. You also have to pay $2.00 for each add-on, with options such as: rice cakes, mozzarella cheese, and ramen noodles, which are all MUST HAVES in my opinion. Brings the bill up a bit, but still a decent price for the portion you're given. I usually go with one other friend, and we're able to finish the whole dish feeling very full and satisfied!   The service is kind of slow, but everyone is really nice. They have a few neat kiddish paintings and quotes on the walls as well, which makes the place look all cutesy! Definitely a go-to for me if I'm looking for a nice, filling meal with lots of variety."}
{"text":"Good restaurant if you have the craving for the Korean cheese, ramen, spicy sauce and rice cake!!! They don't have a lot of choices on the menu...Food always tastes the same here (consistent) and you will always walk out of the restaurant smelling like Korean food... but the food is always good. Just remember to keep adding on the extras because the regular portion is small. Overall, it's a restaurant to go to every couple of months. Not all the time."}
{"text":"We have been here several times always for chicken dak galbi, which. Is a cut up chicken with cabbage rice cakes, carrots and sweet potatoes. Its cooked at your tabke in a sauce.  The portions are ok, but the sauce does nit have great flavor.  The only adjustment they could make is hotter, but i have had dg   With more intensive flavir in queens and korea.  But its the best in toronto which is not great fir krean food. The best dak galbi that is. I dont know of any other dg places.  The prices  are ok, and i will go back, but only because i love dg and there is nowhee else to go."}
{"text":"Seen a lot of my friends post pictures of this place (very excitedly) on Facebook. Also been recommended to come, so I came with my parents.  I'm going to start with the upsides. The two main servers speak fluent English. Major plus. They have two free parking spaces in the back (which they let more than two cars park in...). Also a plus. Biggest plus of the night is that they did not spill stuff on my jacket (see my review on Oh Geul Boh Geul, which I would rather go to than here still...)!  The meh's: The food was pretty decent, but nothing to write home about. We ordered two portions of the dak gal bee with seafood ($11.75 or so per portion). Seafood is mussels, baby octopus and something else I can't remember. We then added noodles (ramen - $2) and at the end, fried rice ($2.50). I had heard that the portions here were small, but I was hoping for the best. I hoped that with the side dishes, there would be enough for the three of us. Turns out I was woefully mistaken. Should have figured that one out by the number of (not) doggy bags the other customers had. The portions were not tiny, but they were definitely not generous portions. There were only four side dishes (kimchi, sweet potato mash, seaweed salad, pickled carrots and radish), and each came in tiny portions. Most ice cream scoops I've had are bigger than that scoop of sweet potato mash. Thankfully, they did allow us a refill. I was super excited for the fried rice, because the menu says that at the end, they put the rice in for you, add sesame oil and seaweed, then mix it up with the remaining sauce and stuff at the bottom of your pan. As soon as I saw the pan (before they put the rice in), I knew this was going to be sad. There was very little sauce to begin with. I mean, it coated what was in the pan, but unless they added more sauce (which they probably did), there would not be enough for the rice. The rice was NOT worth it. Buy a bowl of steamed rice ($1.50) and mix it in yourself. It's cheaper and pretty much the same. I detected a hint of sesame, but I couldn't find any seaweed. The fried rice aside, for two portions of seafood dak gal bee, there was only 1 mussel. Does this mean that each portion only gets 1/2 a mussel? The logic there makes me sad.  The downsides: Menu is quite limited. I prefer restaurants where I can order a zillion different things to eat. Already mentioned the portions above. Will reiterate. At a lot of Korean restaurants where you do your own table top cooking, or share an entree, especially those that say they're for two people, there's usually a lot of food (like enough to feed 3 hungry people or 4 average/small eaters). This was enough for two. We were going to order a bibimbap, but when we placed the order, the server came back to us immediately and apologized that they were out of cooked rice for which to make our bibimbap. This was at 7:15pm. This has never happened to me before. An Asian restaurant running out of cooked rice... wow. They were making more, but we did not want to wait for it. My parents were satisfied (as in no longer hungry), but I was about 55-60% full.   Total damage for the night: $30 and a bit after tax but before tip.  Will I come again? Probably not voluntarily."}
{"text":"I've been to joons many times before but i'm finally writing them a review. I usually always get the Dak Gal Bee, JS1. The JS1 is just normal dak gal bee with chicken and vegetable where you can add on the rice cakes, cheese, noodles, sweet potato, vegetable, steamed rice and fried rice for $1 - $2 each. You can also choose a sauce which is either non spicy, original spicy or very spicy. The JS2 I would say isnt worth the extra bit of money. It comes everything that JS1 has also with frozen octopus, frozen shrimp the very tiny ones, and i got 2 small shrimps with shell, frozen squid which was also minimal and lastly 3 pieces of musselsl. The frozen shrimps were like ------- this big hahaha. None of the seafood in it was actually fresh. They cook it in a big pan on a gas canister on the protable stoves.   I also tried their dumpling soup before i don't know if it was over cooked or just poorly made it was pretty broken when i got it which wasnt how its suppose to be like. PLus the soup is just very bland broth.   The service there sometimes very good and sometimes its very bad. Some waitress will give you refills on appetizers and some will be putting you off like they don't want to give you any. Some people like to stir their own dak gal bee but haha i usually just wait a few tmes.. the girl never came back for us. it was ridiculous.   Parking there is kind of weird they only have 4 spots to park behind joons and you'll have to move whenever someone is leaving like they'll tell  you \"SILVER ACCORD???\" and you'll go move for that person. Personally I rather pay for parking which is 1.50 for half and hour instead of moving the car all the time.   All in all i'll definitely keep going when i'm in the area but i'll stick to JS1"}
{"text":"I love Joons, they always give you lots of little sides (Korean potato salad, bean sprouts, and fish cakes and Kimchi). Their KIMCHI has the right spice and have amazing seafood dishes. My mouth is watering just thinking of it. If you go...go hungry. Gigantic portions  The service is always great and they give good suggestions for those New to Korean."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on Saturday night. I ordered the pork bone soup and my friend ordered kimchi soup. I swear my pork bone soup went bad already. The moment the server put the soup on my table i already smelled the non-freshness. It smelled terrible! I tried a sip and it tasted really wrong! i told the server that the soup tasted weird. The server told me that's because they made the soup in the morning and kept it boiling for a whole day. I'm like OK, but this just taste wrong. Then he told me his boss tasted the soup and it tasted perfectly fine, and just left. Well I don't know what the owner eat every day that he thinks the soup that went wrong already taste fine, but i have a normal person's taste so I'm not OK with this shit. My friend's kimchi soup also tasted weird. The tofu in the soup definitely expired.   Anyway I will never come to this place again and will not recommend it to anyone i know."}
{"text":"I went there the first time today to try their Dak Gal Bee that everyone's been raving about. My friend who I went with does not eat spicy so we ordered it with a non-spicy sauce. It was great that they have a non-spicy option, otherwise I wouldn't get to try this dish since you have to order at least two portions. We had the one with no seafood and added sweet potato and noodles. We didn't order rice cake, but it came with it too, not sure if there's any to start off with. Although I think the dish will taste a lot more delicious with some spicy sauce, but without it it still taste awesome! The sauce they used was just addicting...kind of like a thick Teriyaki sauce. I also loved the chicken and chewy rice cake.   I love how they cook it in front of you, which just gives a warm feel of great service. The waitresses there are also very polite and considerate. For appetizers, they have mashed potatoes served like a scoop of ice cream and green seaweed seasoned with black pepper. Neither of the two appetizers are similar to the other ones I've tried in other Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice is a warm spicy smell in the air, and the second is that everyone here is eating dak galbi. The dak galbi is a mixture of ramen, chicken, napa cabbage, and rice sticks all covered with a sweet spicy sauce and mozarella cheese. A neat korean take on spaghetti. Be prepared to sweat a bit as you eat though! The dish is large enough for 2 and comes out to ~$30."}
{"text":"Joon's is a great place to get a big plate of Korean chicken with all the goodies along with it. Always a great place with company."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for Joons Dak Gal Bee. I always order JS1 with chicken, adding ramen, cheese and dubokki (rice cakes). Everything soaks up and incorporates with each other - flavour in every bite! The spiciness is not too overpowering and is infinitely better than the sweet teriyaki sauce (ie. non-spicy) option. At around $15-16 a person after tax (divving the costs between 2) is a decent price for a full meal.  The side dishes are always plenty and can always be refilled. They have a side dish of a scoop of mashed potatoes (something you don't often see at korean restaurants)."}
{"text":"KOREAN HOT POT IS THE BEST. I don't know anywhere else that does it, therefore this place gets five freaking stars and unless you know of another place that has korean hot pot, with cheese, you can shut your face.   The servers are so awesome. The first time I went, it was with a pro, so I didn't worry about anything. I decided to come with some other friends another time, but we were all new at it. We were a bit worried, because we weren't sure if there would be language communication barrier issues, but omg, they are all super friendly. They told us to order rice, and they come around and tell you when the food is ready so you don't kill yourself eating raw food."}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday, and it was pretty good.  I was also pretty hungry.  I ordered the bulgogi lunch, and it was pretty tasty the portion size was perfect for one person.  The portion of the appetizer side dishes was also perfect for one person.  And I was in and out of there quickly.  A good experience for what it was...but this isn't exactly a fine dining kind of place.  I'd drop in again, they were nice, and the food was good, and cheap. Can't ask for anything more at lunch time when you're starving."}
{"text":"I dropped by for lunch last week and I was not very impressed with the selection of appetizers. I only got 2 dishes!  My dumpling soup was good though, but nothing you can't find at other Korean restaurants in the area.  Maybe I need to come back to try the table cooking. I saw bigger groups ordering various styles of table cooking."}
{"text":"... Maybe i should have gotten cheese? I've rad raving reviews and been told by friends that the dak galbi is the thing to get at joons. They cook the huge pan of food in front of you and it's delicious. Well... Unfortunately I didn't experience either of that. I was surprised that they took reserevations but at 6 pm on a Saturday, the place was pretty empty. The waitress was super cheerful and friendly as she patiently waited for us to decide we wanted. I urged by BFF not to get more than one bowl of rice with the meal because we were not going to finish it and we had already added on rice cakes and instant noodles based on the waitress' recommendation. I opted not to get the cheese... Just didn't feel up for it.  She told us that they were going to cook the dish in the back because our table was too small and it would be too hot, while she was not willing to move us to a four top although the restaurant had plenty of available seats. Our Korean applies did not come out until the main dish was practically ready. A small selection consisting of kimchi, radish, broccoli with hot sauce drizzle and ice cream scooped potato salad that tasted pretty artificial. I really only fancied the pickled radish but Ate a bit of everything else.  Our giant pan came out....instant noodles, rice cake, dark meat chicken, sweet potato which I believe was actually carrots, and cabbage with a large dosage of joons original spicy sauce. The meat was mediocre quality, some pieces better than others, while the spicy sauce had a bit of a kick, but I wasn't willing to try the suicidal. The cabbage was cooked just enough while other pieces had wilted. I really would have wanted the dish cooked in front of me for the full experience and the pan would have stayed warm throughout the whole meal. Being so saucy, once the temperature drops, it is not quite the same.  I guess I had higher expectations for this place.. Still love Korean food but don't keep dak galbi anytime soon. Dolor bibibmap is where it's at!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best Korean restaurants in Toronto! The Dak Galbi is great and huge portions."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see the place fill up for a Wednesday night  We ordered the chicken with original sauce and added on with cheese, ramen, and rice cakes. Originally we ordered 2 portions for 3 people but the waiter said it wouldn't be enough so we changed it to 3 orders.   I was very very hungry and it took them a while to cook but it was SO YUMMY. Loved the sauce too! It was a bit spicy for me but a good spicy. Their side dish was limited and small. The kimchi was more sour than spicy and the scoop of potato was different from what I normally had.  Didn't get much service from here but they did refill our water a few times without being asked.  Definitely need to come back again!"}
{"text":"Interesting and yummy. :) but I don't know how authentic it is to mix instant noodles with chicken or another protein and then top it with mozzarella cheese. It was like a Korean pizza. Tastes really good and very comfort food like.  Their pork bone soup was very peppery and otherwise seemed a little bland. Perhaps it was just that day. It seems very busy there and many people looked like regulars EDIT: I think it was by the day because the next time I tried it again and it was delicious!  The service there is pretty good too! Nice folks and very cheerful."}
{"text":"Love the chicken and seafood rice cakes with added cheese and ramen. Portions are generous as well."}
{"text":"I have been to Joons many times in the past though not recently these days, but after my last experience (yesterday, a Friday night around 8pm inside an empty restaurant) will never visit again. The three of us ordered dakgalbee two portions with $6 of add-ons (btw, the signature ingredient rice cake of dakgalbee is not included and comes at an additional price of $2) and 3 bowls of rice at $2 each. The waiter told us that two portions will not be enough for the three of us to eat but we decided that we were not that hungry so stuck with our order.   As we waited for our food, the server came back to inform us that we were no longer allowed to order three bowls of rice with two orders, but only one bowl per order of dakgalbee. My friend was upset as she felt it was not fair since we were paying for the rice. This \"policy\" was not written in their menu and clearly our server was not aware of it before as he accepted our order in the first place. In an alternative scenario, it wouldn't be very nice if a couple who had ordered 2 servings of dakgalbee and 2 orders of rice but gobbled down the rice too fast and wanted a third or even fourth bowl to accompany the dish and were denied that option (with what will they wipe away that last drop of sesame oil and charred gochujang?). Would they be expected to make a third or fourth order of dakgalbee just so they could order one or two more $2 bowl of rice? It's not like we are getting a great deal on a scarcely available ingredient. It is honestly the first time I have heard of such a policy. I suppose the policy is in place in the case where 20 people were to order one serving of dakgalbee and 20 bowls of rice and ruin their business having successfully filled their stomachs for only $2.50 per person.  So I have concluded that Joons' real policy is You Can't Be Cheap and Full Too. They might also practice morning mantras chanting \"Not Letting Scheming Customers Getting Away with Paying Less Than Premium for Mediocre Commodity\"  While on the topic of exercising vocal cords, another reason why I will not be returning to Joons is because the manager continuously interrupted our server in Korean, from across the room in an angry manner. We thought perhaps she had a complicated passionate point she did not know how to express to us, but of course we found out she was only an ill mannered individual when it was confirmed that she indeed spoke English fluently after she without prompt came directly to our table to address us personally albeit impatiently and rudely. As we decided to leave, with her blessing, she immediately resumed complaining loudly in Korean while returning to her seat at a four person dining table, perhaps to communicate to us departing customers how (i)mad(/i) she is about customers trying to order an extra bowl of $2 rice, or how unfair it is that other restaurants are packed while theirs stood empty on a Friday night."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken plus cheese is.. No words can describe that tasty satisfaction. We also tried the pork bone stew but was less than impressed. There wasn't a lot of meat on the bone and the meat was not very tasty - probably wanted stewed for long enough."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now, myself and with friends and I like it. The proportions here are not obnoxious that it gives you itis. The waitstaff speak English which is key, so my non-Korean friends don't feel like an outcast.  It's a great place for group eating outs - they have a great selection of jun-gol and \"instant\" food, which implements the very popular instant cooking method of meat and other stuff like seafood, instant noodles, rice cakes ,tempura and so on. Its a popular style of eating for groups and this restaurant does it well. I think it's the only one with such variety for instant cooking dishes.  It's especially good that when you order these things which require cooking, the waitstaff come around to check on the food and make sure it's made ready the way it is supposed to be - which is helpful for those who are venturing out to foreign grounds - i can't even tell you how many times I've seen people eat the vegetable off the bibibop separately from the rice and had to tell them that you're supposed to mix it all together and be thanked for letting them know...it's embarrassing for the both of us really.  The various foods I've tried here had been all well prepared with appropriate seasoning that I would recommend the entire menu to be a safe choice - it even has full English translation, which is rare in these parts. If you're not particularly inclined to spicy food? that's okay, they will make it mild for you. All in all a good venue to drag your non-Korean food-exposed friend to."}
{"text":"This restaurant is such an old favourite that I had to come by it after being absent for 8? years. I grew up on this food during late night outings in the area. Parking is free everywhere after 9PM so make this joint a late night snack! I usually order the SJ1 + Joons classic sauce + cheese + ramen + rice cake to the Dak Gal Bee for 2 people. Comes out to $27.70 after tax. It's worth a visit for those who haven't tried!"}
{"text":"I come here for one dish: their chicken ramen with double cheese is so amazing.  They definitely don't cheap out on the chicken, and it tastes sooooo good.  Everything else is okay, but if you come to joons, you must have to get the chicken."}
{"text":"Visited around 6pm on a Thursday evening, and it was pretty empty when we first walked in, progressively getting busier as the night went on. I was a bit worried I wouldn't be able to tolerate the spice of the famous dakgalbee dish, but it wasn't too bad. We were a party of four, so we got two portions of the seafood and chicken versions, topped with their original sauce, mozzarella cheese, and rice cakes. I think the cheese helped tone down the spiciness, so it's a good addition if you have low spice tolerance like me.   The servers were very nice, and didn't seem to mind that we lingered for an hour after our meal, chatting away. Joons is a simple restaurant that I would definitely recommend trying at least once if you are in the North York area."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night as a few of my friends were craving \"Korean fast food\" and it was not so crowded.    The atmosphere is great if you just want to hang out with your friends and talk for a bit. We ordered the Dak Gal Bee with chicken to share, and thought there was limited chicken and noodles and a lot more vegetables. They definitely could've given us more of it. The flavouring was great to satisfy cravings.   Dumplings tasted good. It was a bit plain, but the side dishes made up for it, mainly the sweet mash! :)"}
{"text":"Came by here Friday evening around 6:30ish. The place wasn't full yet but there was a crowd, either way, we got a table. The waiters will ask if you need a burner table or a non-burner table. If you're ordering any of Joon's specialty foods (JS1-JS7 on the menu), I recommend the burner table. So my group ordered the JS4 Dak Galbi with noodles, rice cakes and cheese as additional add-ons, also got 3 rice separately. Each add-on is $2. Banchan consists of Kimchi, bean sprouts, pickled sliced daikon and mashed potato. Didn't get a chance to try the kimchi cuz my friend devoured it, said it was really good. Nothing to say for the bean sprouts or daikon but the mashed potato was interesting, I'm assuming they used the Korean sweet potato to make since there was a hint of sweetness, it was good either way. Now, this establishment lost a star due to the attentiveness of our waiter, our food (mainly the rice cake) was actually getting stuck to the bottom of the pan so what ended up happening was we ended up tending it until he noticed us...tbh...there was literally no one in the restaurant at the point. Final verdict: dak galbi...really, really good. Service was slightly lacking but w/e. Total for the dinner for 3: $42.88 Will come back again."}
{"text":"Compared with other Korean restaurant, this one is just ok because the dishes before the meal are not so good. But the chicken and rice cakes there tastes really soft and chewing."}
{"text":"Joons is a short walk from the Christie subway stop. The Koreatown area gives a nice atmosphere and there are plenty of stores to check out before and after your dinner, giving a whole \"fleshed out\" feeling to the entire trip.  Despite the area's brevity, one can easily spend a few hours here.   Upon entering the restaurant we were quickly greeted by the host/cook and the worker behind the counter. We were asked whether we wanted a regular table or one with one of the burners on it. Going in, I knew I wanted to order the Dak Galbi. If you know you want this dish and are not asked which table you would like, I advise you to ask for one of the tables with the burners on it. We were seated and brought a pitcher of water and cups and were promptly brought refills the first time we went. The second time I had to go to the counter and ask, but seeing as the place was far busier than the first time we came, with a heavy amount of dinner patrons AND a large party there for a birthday, this was easily forgivable.   You initially order two servings of Dak Galbi (only chicken and cabbage) and then add on what you wish to add onto it. Because of this, your final price for the Dak Galbi can range from about 18 dollars to 32 or so. The first time I ordered sweet potato, extra vegetables, two sides of rice, and mozzarella cheese. The second time I decided to add the rice cakes in, which I will never do without again. You can also have the option of adding noodles (ramen-type) into the mix. They bring out a pan with the vegetables and chicken and continue adding things throughout the cooking process. At the end, they bring out the cheese to sprinkle on top until it melts. At this point, they serve you your rice and banchan.  One thing that was to become one of my favorite parts of Korean dining is the ample amount of free side dishes, known as banchan, given to you alongside your meal. There are a wide variety depending on the restaurant you go to, but the two times I went to Joons I received kimchi (spicy fermented cabbage), Korean potato salad, bean sprouts, and fish cakes.This was my first banchan experience and I had been wanting to try kimchi for quite some time. I tried the kimchi at two other places and Joons was by far my favorite. The beansprouts were the standard cold dish fare and what one would expect (delicious). The Korean potato salad is quite the treat. Essentially, it is mashed potatoes made with apples, mayonnaise, and various vegetables.  and served cold. The fish cakes were quite strong of fish flavor, but had a pleasant overall taste. You can get refills of these dishes as you please.  I couldn't help but salivate while I watched and waited for the Dak Galbi to finish cooking while catching whiffs of aroma from the gochujang-based sauce. After having eaten it, I can't imagine going to Joons and ordering anything else. If I were to live in Toronto, I would make a weekly pilgrimage to Joons for this dish. The layers of flavor within the dish, supplemented by the wonderful banchan and moist white rice, keep your taste buds working overtime and discovering something new with every bite. The amount of food and the balanced nature of the ingredients left me feeling satisfied and full both times. Take the advice of many reviewers and please do not skip out on the rice cakes, sweet potato, and mozzarella. These ingredients are essential in making the dish the bountiful, stomach stuffing, stratum of flavor experience that this dish is. I would advise the extra vegetables as well to soak up  the wonderful, full-flavored, slightly sweet and mildly spicy sauce.  I've yet to find another place that serves Dak Galbi in this full, fleshed-out manner. I can't speak for the rest of the menu and probably never will be able to, but I do know that Joons is a unique food treasure which offers a mostly overlooked dish here in North America and they do it very, very well. Joons has helped open a new world of culinary adventure for me. It also gave me a great reason to visit Toronto again in the future."}
{"text":"Simple and delicious.  Essentially you're here for the dak galbi. They mix chicken/seafood, cabbage, and some sort of kimchi / chili sauce on a hot plate. It's a good idea to add rice cakes, noodles and cheese.  I have no idea how this measures up in terms of authenticity, but it tastes good, and makes for an interesting experience.  Servers are friendly, but have a ton of people to look after when it's busy. Be ready to vigorously flag them down."}
{"text":"I've said this before,  I'm a snot when it comes to Korean food so I'm sort of hard pressed to give any Korean restaurant in Toronto 5 stars 'cause I'm one of those annoying assholes who thinks she knows better.  Anyway, if I could wipe the memory of the first time I had dak kalbi in this style in Seoul I would give this place 5 stars.  In there defense, this is a relatively modern recipe so I don't know that there's a truly traditional way of preparing it and I believe it's a specialty of a certain area in Korea so I'm sure the version I had in Seoul was just a version of the original as well. For the price the food is real good and the novelty of having a Korean place dedicated to this style of dak kalbi in Toronto is really worthy of more stars but the reason why I haven't is that  I wish that when they added the rice at the end they would really let it get crispy and carmellized like they do in a dolsot bimbimbap before they mixed it up again.  That's really the key thing I remember about the first time I had dak kalbi in Seoul which I find missing in Joon's version. The 4th star is really for the really good service I've consistantly received here and the beer is always icy cold which is integral to this eating.  I have a friend who is a die hard fan of Joon's and actually eats here at least once a week despite the fact that it makes her clothing smell like dead bear.  It's so bad that she's relegated to bringing a garbage bag to seal her jacket in before she enters the restaurant to shield it from the ensuing reek.  It's a lot of pungent garlic and meat smoke imbedding into your clothing so do what I do and get an outfit that you can dedicate to wearing while dining at Joon's and forget about dancing at the disco after....'cause baby, you gonna be dancin' alone."}
{"text":"I really wanted to adore this place since I had been eyeing it for a while and a friend had hyped it up, so I stopped by on my birthday. First of all, the seating is extremely cramped. The entry way itself, you have to push past lines of people to get out which, after trying the food, I couldn't really fathom why. We really wanted to try the dakgalbi, their speciality, but we were told we couldn't get that unless we ordered TWO of those. Ridiculous! After waiting in line so long and to be forced in to trying to get two huge portions simply for two people is crazy. Maybe the line up was because they try to enforce this rule and so people come in big groups which I think is absolutely silly. We were already here and waited so long that we didn't want to leave. Seeing what little options we had other than the dakgalbi should have been our next clue to leave.   In the end, we opted for a ramen and a soup - both of which were doused in spice, and extremely watered down. Don't get me wrong, I'm South Asian so you know for a fact I'm not afraid of spices whatsoever but it was so much that all you could taste was the spice and nothing else. You literally could not taste anything else, no kimchi, none of the vegetables, not even salt. The ramen was a seafood ramen, but I got a total of one piece of (frozen, still cold) shrimp and two minuscule pieces of mussel. And that was just my ramen! My friend's soup was watered down, and again, all you could taste was tomato and the spiciness. Not even the rice it came with could make it better.   The cheapness of the dishes should have been a reflection of the food and we should have stayed away, however it was because it was all so cheaply priced that we didn't feel that ripped off walking out of. The side dishes were also disappointing, specifically the sweet potato mash although it was nice to try a texture different than water. The cleaniless is also another topic on it's own. Flies were flying around and everytime I opened my mouth, I was afraid I would accidentally swallow one so I was consciously minding each bite which is a red flag of it's own. We didn't even finish, paid and simply left. All around disappointment. Stay far, far away especially in such an abundant place like North York where Korean places are a dime a dozen."}
{"text":"The food is always good here, my fave is the table cooking, i like their original spicy Joon sauce. However, they can't provide a glass of ice for their drinks. Find that weird to not have ice available, especially in the summer time."}
{"text":"Best place for Korean confort food! Have not been in years but food and service is still great! The Chicken Dakgalbi with cheese and ramen was the best combination!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend decided to introduce me to Dakgalbi! Or however you would spell it... Anyways, it was a life changing experience because now that's all I crave, haha. I definitely need to try more but Houston doesn't have too many variety of Korean foods. I'm trying not to fly back just to eat there without my boyfriend knowing.. I'm kidding.  Let's skip to the important things like dakgalbi. One order was perfect for two people. You get to choose what you put into your dakgalbi so we added one serving of Ramen which clearly wasn't enough. That's all I was picking at! I added rice cakes, chicken, and cheese! We only added cheese to half of the order and it was definitely enough for that whole pan. It was a bit too cheesy but my boyfriend loves it like that so I wasn't mad. The taste was not anything crazy but I'm a pretty plain person so I don't expect anything blasting with flavor. I don't even dip my chicken nuggets most of the time so that tells you a lot about my poor taste buds. A++ for that amazing dish. I can't stop thinking about it. I think I need some serious help.   The service was great! The lady that helped us was super nice! The place gave me a nice and warm feeling to be at on a super cold day. I was desperate to go back for my last meal in Toronto but I really didn't want to drag my luggage everywhere on the subway and what not. Now I regret not doing that...   You must try it if you've never had it! I'll be on the lookout for more Dakgalbi..."}
{"text":"I love their appetizers... so yummy. Especially their mashed potatoes; what do they put in it... cocaine?!   Pros:  - very nice waitresses - they have booths with grills designed in the table (uber cool)  - novelty idea: the waitresses cook right at your table (if you're sitting in a booth)!  - GET IT WITH CHEESE! :D - I'm always full, if not completely stuffed, after a meal at Joon's!   Cons:  - if you're seated on tables, you don't get to see the waitresses cook in front of you. They tend to cook at one table and bring the pan to you later...not cool  :(  - if you're getting the entrees which they cook in front of you, you have to order 2 of the same dish which generally leads to less choice/variety  - they only accept debit or cash   I actually didn't realize this until lately, but what they cook in front of you can be easily replicated at home. Nonetheless, it is pretty good food."}
{"text":"This review actually should sit a bit closer to 3.5 stars as I feel this place has changed a bit for the worse.  When I worked in the area, my co workers and I used to frequent this place as our go to for lunch and sometimes dinner.  No complaints on service, speed of food, and quantity. They seem to be also very consistent with all of the above after multiple times back.  Food is decently priced, good variety, pork bone soup was consistently tasty. The one thing that I always enjoyed was their Dakalbi. Whenever I have a craving for this dish I always go back here.  I can't seem to find another place that makes this dish quite so well  I recently had a craving and went back but was slightly disappointed.  They used to bring a hot burner to your table, put the ingredients in a large metal pan partially cooked and let you finish off the cooking. This let you get the food to the level of \"crispiness\" you desire.  They no longer bring the hot burner out but instead bring the dish fully cooked for you.  The dish is still tasty, but its missing the bit of burnt crispiness when you overcook it slightly.   If you get rice with the dish, don't eat everything right away. Leave some chicken. When your nearly done, they will take your dish back and mix in the chicken with rice and fry it up together.  It's still a good filling tasty meal, but I have to knock off a star because I had it from them before they started bringing it out fully cooked.  I understand it's faster and more efficient for them, but there is room for a bit of improvement"}
{"text":"Susan C. lays it down hard, but where else are you going to find dak galbi in Toronto?  Definitely a different dinner option, dak galbi is a popular dish found in taverns/pubs in Korea, and is well-consumed with beer in hand.   Dak galbi is spicy marinated chicken cooked at the table, with a variety of veggies tossed in. You can add extra veg/meat, ddok (rice cake) or ramen to customize as you see fit, but the cherry on top is the shredded cheese that gets added near the end. How many other Korean dishes use cheese? Sounds unorthodox at first, but it works surprisingly well.  Note: if you know you're going for this dish (or others necessitating a burner), grab a table with a built-in hot plate. Also, if you're hard-core, you can fry off some rice in the pan to use up the remnants of the sauce and bits. I'm usually stuffed at this point in the meal, though, and don't bother.  Grievance: this place doesn't take debit or credit, and I never trust those third-party ATMs. Come prepared with cash.   Oh, this place was going to get four-stars, but I remembered something damn annoying. They don't bring out the ban chan (you know, the small appetizers) until your food is ready to eat. I understand that this prevents people from gorging on the free offerings while waiting for the food to cook, but fuck that shit."}
{"text":"Had lunch on a Wednesday.  It was pretty much dead.  Ordered the hot stone bowl with seafood, tofu and spicy broth.  It was decent as I think the broth was lacking flavour.  I'll come back and give it a second chance before I write the place off.  Lots of good reviews so it deserves another look."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and a friend who had never tried Korean food before, and this restaurant made her a big fan.  The dakgalbi is what you want, and the spicy chicken option with cheese is mind blowingly good. Seriously some of the most delicious food I've ever had. If you order this, you need to sit at one of the special tables with the heating element in the center so they can cook it before your very eyes (smelling delicious under your very noses). The only downside is you must order a portion for at least 2, so you need to get another member of your group on board with your order, which can be tough with picky eaters in the group. In my group of 3, 2 of us ordered this while my wife ordered shrimp fried rice, but after tasting some of our dish she immediately wished she had joined in on our order instead (though she still enjoyed her dish)  Pricing was all very reasonable, it wasn't too busy, service was fast and friendly, and there's all sorts of other interesting Korean dishes you can try too. Check it out for sure!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for a ramen and cheese fix!   Pros:  - I always get the pan dish and add ramen, octopus and pork! Extra additions that are great include rice cakes, ramen, and cheese!  - Also recommend getting the Kimchi Fried Rice! It's not to spicy and full of that kimchi flavour.  - Quick service. The servers are so nice and always come and greet you right away which I really appreciate.  - Appetizers: The sweet mashed potatoes are so good and the kimchi is not to spicy. Wish they sold it on the side so I can buy some to take home.   Cons: - Although I love the dish, sometimes I feel like it is a little pricey for the amount that you get - There is never any free parking and if you choose to pay for parking, the lot behind charges about $2-3/ per half an hour.  - Unfortunately, they don't take all methods of payment. Only cash or debit. No credit cards which is odd for an establishment that's been around for so long   Overall, will definitely be coming back! Totally recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"People gave high  reviews prob have never been to the willowdale location. Compare to uptown location, this one really sucks. Portion is smaller and spicy chicken is not spicy at all. What a disappointment. Definitely will never go back. I highly recommend the uptown location."}
{"text":"Other than their spicy chicken, you must try their cold noodle in the summer. Unfortunately, they only serve it for a short period of time, imo its the best buckwheat cold noodle in town."}
{"text":"Came here with a group on Friday night, and it was packed! Make sure you wear layers, because the place is hot + the food is hot. My friend and I shared the chicken and seafood dak gal bee with the Joon's original sauce and cheese. It was okay (I forgot to add in the rice cakes!). There's a minimum of two orders for that dish. Just a warning though: the prices do stack up because of the add-ons to the dak gal bee. But without some toppings, the plate can get bland. Other than that, all was good. Service was prompt. The restaurant has wooden tables, chairs, and booths. Noise level was very energetic."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Korean restaurants.   I especially love the Dak Gal Bee- you have to order a minimum of 2 portions it's perfect for 2-3 people. You have the option to add other items to your dish- it comes with chicken and veggies. Whenever I go I add the cheese, rice cakes and noodles. It tastes amazing. I go with the original spicy and although I can take a fair amount of spice this is perfect.   I have tried their dumplings, dolsot bibimbap, soon tofu stew as well. I enjoy all of the items I have tried, never once been disappointed.  In terms of service, the staff are very friendly overall unless it is really busy and hectic they are less attentive. Price wise I am satisfied with for the quality of food. Would recommend to my friends and continue to go."}
{"text":"We ordered Dak Gal Bee as per everyone's suggestion and added cheese & rice cake as well as chicken.  Also, we had noodles added as well with a moderate amount of spice.  If you come super hungry, you'll find that it's pretty awesome initially.  The rice cakes, however, make you feel disgustingly full (+ the noodles) and midway through, I felt myself getting quite bloated and sick from it.    Definitely a small restaurant and definitely worth giving it another try.  Come hungry though if you're getting that Dak Gal Bee."}
{"text":"Went with some friends to Joon's on a recommendation by a friend and what I saw Yelp. We shared three portions of DakGalBee with noodles, chicken, cheese and kimchi between 4 people. The amount of food just right and the taste of the food was amazing. I wish they would have given us a spoon to scoop the food out into our bowl. Also if they had given us some bread to scoop the sauce out at the end I would have given this place a 5 star.   The restaurant is a little small but as a big guy I was still able to get around the seat comfortably."}
{"text":"I'm not a Korean expert, but I don't know about this whole \"mixing chicken with cheese and noodles\", whether it is of authentic Korean cuisine. With that aside...I came here on a Tuesday night at around 8:45pm, and it was relatively full, mostly filled with young adults. My dad was probably the oldest person in the restaurant!  We pondered over JS2 and JS3, but looking at the reviews (they have free wifi!) and how the chicken was so popular, we went with JS2. The chicken came fast, but it took a really long time for the cheese and noodles to arrive. The waitresses helped mix the chicken with the cheese and noodles, however she had to bring the cooking table away from us as our table was too small.  The chicken was nothing special, though the cheese did help the 2-portion meal be a bit more filling. Otherwise, I agree the portions were quite small, basically \"you get what you paid for\" kind of style. We also got the seafood soontofu. We asked for non-spicy, although what we got was literally white...which really wasn't what I expected; I should've asked for less spicy.  Service lacked quite a bit as it was quite understaffed, with only two waitresses taking care of the full house restaurant on a Tuesday night. In a way I understand, but everything did take a while to arrive, and we didn't start eating until over half an hour into sitting."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. There isn't a huge selection but it was sufficient. We got soups and fried rice for my son. Their fried rice was actually really good!! They use their Korean rice so it makes it sweet and quite tasty! The soups were quite good too. I wouldn't mind going back to try their BBQ at dinner time!"}
{"text":"I tried their dak galbi it was really goood!! Second time being here an I can truly say that it's by far one of the best korean restaurants in Toronto. I will for sure come here again. :)"}
{"text":"Who wouldn't come here for a cheesy instant noodles craving?  I always order the JS2 Dak Gal Bee with chicken and seafood.  I've always ordered it with the Joons special sauce, but I think next time I go I will try the spicy sauce for once.  I'm actually not the biggest fan of the rice cakes there as I find them a bit plain - the noodles with mozzarella cheese have much more chewiness to them as well as flavour.  There's definitely a good amount of meat that comes with the combo, sufficient for two hungry souls on a cold winter day.    Their sweet mash as sides is great too.  I just fear for the servers' safety when they cook the noodles since the equipment they use to cook the dishes look a bit archaic."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, portions were smaller than usually, u have to add cheese, ramen and rice cake, don't bother getting the rice add ones  We waited 30mins for our food to come and they wouldn't give us our side dishes until our meal came......"}
{"text":"I come for the Bipimbop, and I leave happy.  Nothing like the joys of making sure your fingers don't touch the outside of the stone bowl, which has been heated beyond that of the fires of Hades.  The flavours all work in a beautiful tandem, delivering nothing but pure joy and ecstasy to my belly.  And the sides - the unlimited, wonderful, sides - the kimchi, the strange cold potatoes, the tofu...  Everything is wonderful.    Sadly, they're not open Sundays.  I learned that through a soul crushing experience - because when I want Joon's, nothing else will do."}
{"text":"You can enter the restaurant through the parking area in the back as well as from their street entrance. Im always at this place for their chicken ramen with original sauce, rice cakes and cheese.. Worth every bite. The portion for this is good for 2-3 people. I've only ever had the ramen and the dumplings which are also pretty good. Their service is what you'd expect it to be."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourite places to eat. Unfortunately it just doesn't taste the same anymore. Starting off with the noodles. Why can't I add extra noodles? They are able to accomodate extra of everything else but not noodles? Sounds like they want us to order a second dish. They add only ONE bag of instant ramen per dish, doesn't matter how many \"portions\" you pay for. The \"portions\" you pay for are only for the meat you choose. So if you're doing 6 portions for 6 people in one dish with noodles, that's 6 portion of meat and still only 1 bag of instant ramen. Also the taste has gotten really watered down. We felt that all the flavour wasn't there anymore. Luckily at han ba tang, if you order their Mac and cheese spicy with cheesy chicken plate, it has the taste of the previous delicious joons. Won't be returning anymore. Sadly. It's unfortunate that their food has gone downhill. There used to be a line up on Friday's and weekends, and sometimes even weekdays. Now you're able to get a table on friday/Saturday at the peak of dinner time without any wait, and the entire restaurant is almost empty too. That says a lot. Especially in ktown and the area they are in. A lot of the restaurants are busy during dinner. But not joons, at least not anymore. The amount of customers they have left pretty much shows you this place has gone downhill."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've only had their hotpot, which is amazing. Bring friends, sit down and enjoy. Probably my favorite location for hotpot in town."}
{"text":"I love this place.   I've never tried anything else on the menu besides the Dakgalbi (because it's THAT good).   I always get it with the regular level spicy (+ rice cakes, noodles and mozzarella cheese)   I would recommend asking them to put less vegetables (they always put a lot and less chicken). Otherwise... it tastes amazing! Always a fave, never disappoints."}
{"text":"Decently good food. Sometimes hard to find parking in that area. Though there are about four designated free parking spots behind the store. More unique Korean food - mainly bring the big sizzling plate - which tastes great especially with cheese and noodle add on, but isn't very good value for money, as it is minimum two portions. So, for a sizzling plate, it is at least$20 and probably$25 after the add ons. This won't get two people full so you need to add another dish of some sort, bring the total up to well over $35 for what is supposed to be a cheap casual restaurant. Oh, and I didn't even include any drinks!"}
{"text":"Came in with coworkers on a Friday night. Place is packed! Good thing we called a few days before for a reservation. We ordered 2 orders of Teriyaki beef and octopus with mozzarella and ramen and 2 orders of spicy chicken and seafood with mozzarella and ramen. Both are ok. I just find too many cabbage on the serving. I love the rice cake in it. They also serve appetizers which we enjoyed especially the pickled radish and mash potato.  Service is good. Price not too expensive. Staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I used to come to this restaurant often when they were relatively new. Over the years I feel that quality has gone down the drain.   We ate there last night.  Got their dak galbi, bul go gi, and cold noodle soup.   They were all horrible.   What bother me the most was that dak gal bi, their signature dish ingredients,  well there is nothing there.  Only cabbage and chicken,  that's it. I remember they used to include some green onions, carrots and even some rice cakes.  Now everything is paid toppings.  Its on our banned list now."}
{"text":"Oh Joon's, how I love thee.  Korean hot pot with cheese?  Bizarre combination, kind of like hot dogs and seaweed (see Japadog in Vancouver) but creates an amazing taste sensation in your mouth.    The ordering rules were kind of confusing.  Supposedly we had to order a minimum of two orders per entree, but this was communicated poorly on the menu - definitely an area of opportunity.  On Bloor, it is tough to find this place.  It is on the semi-basement level and has the feel of a 'hole in the wall' which is great if you're like me and sometimes want to take your date out to \"a special local place that's hard to find\".   Service was excellent - our server was vibrant, fun and very attentive.    Korean hot pot with cheese?  Go for it.  See you there.   Have some soju with that as well (Korean vodka)"}
{"text":"The food was only so-so for me. The prices were not worth the meal. It was also much too crowded.  I feel sorry for the busy waiters  For individuals with a smaller appetite,  this might be a nice place to warm up.  I don't  recommend it."}
{"text":"I remember Joons tasting much better back in the day. But now I have to write a review to let others know that their quality has gone downhill. We ordered the typical dak gal bee. You have the option for chicken or chicken seafood nssve yourself the $ and get the chicken.  The seafood is pathetic, some small mussels and squids and shrimps. The noodles are good and so is the sauce. However they limit how many noodles you can get (it's 1 noodle pack per pan).   Can't write anything to take home about. If you're here to eat you know what you want."}
{"text":"I came to Joon's again and ordered the DakGalBee for dinner with rice cakes, mozzarella cheese, and noodles, but this time with the original Joon's spicy sauce. As someone who cannot eat a lot of spicy food, I found the sauce spicy but at a tolerable level, unlike what other Yelpers have mentioned. However, it really complemented the dish better than the teriyaki sauce that I had last time. My friend who generally can eat spicy food didn't find the sauce spicy though, so I guess it's just a matter of preference."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Joons for years and not once did it ever fail to satisfy me. The chicken dakgalbi is the best with noodles, rice cakes, and mozzarella. The side dishes are great, especially the sweet potato."}
{"text":"YUM!! Ordered the chaechap mein and the daegalbee and it was delicious :) spicy and yummy!! It's comparable to Korea, but not AS good. Although I'm incredibly spoiled because south Korea just tastes better... It's amazing though, gotta try it.  The waiter was very nice, and I went out with three others and we had the mein for app and then 3 portions of the daegalbee which was enough! We ordered it with cheese and ramen and rice cakes soooooo good"}
{"text":"I usually come here for the dakgalbi but we decided to try the stews this time, and it was surprisingly very tasty since Joons is known primarily for its dakgalbi. We got the bulnak jungol, tteokbokki, and kimchi fried rice. Everything was excellent. I would most likely come back in the future for the stews rather than the dakgalbi from now on."}
{"text":"We went to Joons restaurant for lunch. Joons restaurant is a plainly decorated restaurant similar to other restaurants in the area. The restaurant was not very busy and the service was brisk.  We ordered the beef dumplings and Jjeesong bulgoli. The dumplings were okay, but not flavor to them. The bulgoli was difficult to eat because we did not know how to eat it. We did not know we have to cook it for 10 minutes on the gas stove on the table before eating it. Afterward it was pretty good.  Would we go back? Maybe if we were in the area."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a meeting this morning and met up with friends who worked nearby after to grab lunch. A bit of spicy Korean was definitely in order given the -10° weather. Even though Joons is known for their dakgalbee, an awesome carb-y combo of rice cake, cheese, and rice and/or ramen, we opted against it this time around so they wouldn't have to go back into the office smelling like spicy cheese. Instead, we ordered the vegetable soft tofu soup, bulgogi noodles, and the spicy chicken rice. My friend originally wanted to warm up with some pork bone soup, but they didn't have it ready yet when we got in shortly after 11:30. We were told the wait would be about an hour for it, which I guess is a mixed blessing as any soup that takes an hour plus to prepare must be relatively authentic. The food was pretty good, but the conversation was better. My favourite was the spicy chicken rice and Joons' mashed potato side dish. Prices are great, lunch for under $15 with tax and tip, but they don't accept credit here, only debit and cash. The meal was fine while we were eating, but settled heavily and a bit uncomfortably a couple hours later, just something to keep in mind - and I have a pretty cast-iron stomach!"}
{"text":"This place was quite the disappointment. I don't remember it being this bad 4 years ago. Or maybe I just forgot.   Anyways, came here for dinner with a friend. She got bulgogi and I got the tofu stew. The bulgogi was quite tasteless with no spice at all. My tofu stew was a depressing site. You know those seafood medleys that come frozen at the grocery store? I think mine was made of that. There was one calamari ring, three mussels and one dried up shrimp. LOTS AND LOTS OF ONIONS.   Oh and the side dishes?!? What on earth is happening. I've never seen side dishes so garbage before. Not to poop on a place but kimchi, radish, mashed potatoes and broccoli with hot sauce on top doesn't sound right. Where's the seaweed, beans and sprouts.  I don't see myself returning here."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Tuesday evening and the restaurant was not busy - 4 other tables occupied. It took 10  minutes to get a menu, another 10 minutes to finally get a hold of someone to take our order and another 20 minutes to get our food.   What you need to know:  -Do NOT order the dumplings - they tasted of freezer burn and were plated on stale cabbage. Pretty sure they have been sitting in the freezer for months. -The restaurant was dirty. There were so many flies & fruitflies landing in our food.  -If you do decide to try this place out, sit near the back of the restaurant where you will receive more attention from the staff and can avoid all the bugs flying into the restaurant (they leave the front door open).   I will definitely not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I used to really love coming here because I love noodles and rice cakes and spicy things which is all here in one dish.  But honestly each time I come I feel unsatisfied since it's really not worth the price.....it's really just some cheap instant noodles and rice cakes..mixed with some vegetables and a few pieces of chicken in some mediocre sauce on a big pan..priced at over $30 bucks."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!! I just had their uhh shoot I forgot what it's called but the pot with the chicken and the spicy deliciousness.  I added vegies, rice cake, noodles, and CHEEESSEEE if you havent had it with cheese you have to its soo good!   They took a little long, so i had some (3 bottles) of soju...man was that DELICIOUS! Soju and coke...haha not sure if im reviewing the restaurant or the soju....  Haha but this place is good I love it and its actually one of my fav korean restaurants.  YUMMY"}
{"text":"I'd call this a 3.5!  We enjoyed our dinner here! We went for the ever popular spicy chicken Dakgalbi and added rice cakes, extra vegetables, cheese and ramen noodles (add-ons are $2.25 each).   You have to order at least two portions of the dakgalbi which starts at around $11.00 each x 2. We thought the add-ons are multiplied by order but surprisingly they were not. Our meal for two came to around $40 including tax and tip.   The flavour was great, if you love spicy food, I definitely recommend the spicy original sauce, they have an even spicier version but I found the original to be spicy enough. I'm glad we also had the banchan which were above average, especially the potato salad and pickled radish which were welcoming additions to the spicy chicken. The portion is good for two, we managed to finish almost all of it, with some cabbage and pieces of chicken left over. The rice cakes were my favourite, they were chewy and delicious in the spicy sauce, I'd say it's a must-add! We did find that it gets a bit boring after a while that's the only downfall with this type of 'two orders minimum' style of dining. I would understand if they were serving in one of those hot plates on a burner but it was just a large dish that could have easily been split into two individual portions. I saw some pictures of the burners but I guess they've phased that out, maybe it's time for a menu update as well!   The service was really good, the food took a bit of time to come out but it wasn't unreasonable. Water refills and banchan refills were offered regularly which was great because the food was spicy! The waitress was sweet and attentive. They seemed genuine and appreciative of our business which is always nice.   The restaurant isn't much to look at, very simply decorated, could maybe use some updates but it's not all that important! We got a table quickly which was nice.   Would likely come back if I'm in the mood for something spicy and hearty!"}
{"text":"Friends and I stopped by, sat for 2 mins, looked at the menu, and simply took off. There was nothing appealing and the items were most basic Korean dishes."}
{"text":"Very overpriced. The owner there is trying to cut down food cost so much that the quality of meat and vegetables that are used here is horrible. Do not go here. I would go to Galleria supermarket instead. Galleria has much more authentic korean food and the price is less then half of Joon's. DO NOT GO."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I really love this place! I go with a different group every time and everyone always enjoy their meal. Of course I always order the dakgalbi which is what Joons is known for! I've ordered either the chicken or beef option and both were delicious. I always add in cheese, rice cake and ramen noodles. The portion may seem small at first but towards the end me and my friends/family always struggle with finishing it. I've tried the steam dumplings a few times and it was amazing too. My mouth is watering just remembering my last meal at Joons!  I find it kind of odd that you have to order at least 2 portions of the dakgalbi but in the menu they give the price for just 1 portion. I recommended Joons to a friend and she told me she didn't realize she had to order 2 so she was super confused when she got her bill! I must imagine they get quite a bit of confused customers at the check-out.   Service is alright, nothing beyond my expectations really. 3 stars because the fruit flies ...super annoying - especially during the summer :( But overall I would recommend this place if you are down to try something new ...and want to consume a loooooot of carbs haha."}
{"text":"Joons specialty is their table top cooking. Most tables come with a built-in stove in the middle of the table where the cooking is done.   Waitstaff will bring out the raw veggies and meat and get things cooking for you, then they come back frequently to stir the food and advise you when it's ready to eat.  I usually get the Dal Gal Bee chicken dish that comes in a very spicy sauce. It's tasty but I get annoyed that I have to pay more money ($2) to get extra veggies added (otherwise you get very little) plus pay extra for rice on the side ($1)  After adding all the \"extras\" it ends up costing $12-$13 plus tax, which is obviously pretty cheap, yet somehow annoys me because every other imaginable meal in Korea Town usually costs $6-$7.   What else can I say, this place is decent but it's nothing special."}
{"text":"One of my go to spots whenever I crave dakgalbi! Came here for dinner and was happy with the food and service. Our server was really nice and the food came out super quick, which we appreciated cause we were extremelyyyyy hungry.   We decided to try the seafood and chicken dakgalbi and it was delicious! They could add a bit more seafood but we added in noodles so that filled us up. We also got the rice cakes- they were SPICY, soft yet chewy at the same time. One of the best rice cakes I've ever tasted.   Just a note: you can order rice and they will make fried rice for you with whatever is left over- but you HAVE to have some leftover sauce and stuff in order to do it! What's nice is that they do it for you- excellent service!  Would definitely recommend Joons if you're in the area or craving some delicious dakgalbi."}
{"text":"Ordered the DakGalbee with cheese and ramen. i thought it was really good. and would definitely like to have more of it. the portions we got were pretty much just for sampling as we were restaurant hopping. it wasn't spicy like i expected it to be. there was a slight kick but nothing that was making me sweat, tear up, or nose run. we also ordered the beef one with just cheese. aside from the meat. they pretty much taste the same."}
{"text":"Utterly unimpressed. Although the price is cheap (6.75 for an entree), the content and quantity is abysmally small. I got the Spicy Pork stir fry with rice, and I ate all of it in 5 minutes and was dying for more food.  My friends' bibimbop and tofu pot had no beef, which was kinda ridiculous since the beef is supposed to be there. Perhaps if we had gotten the tabletop cooking the experience would have been different?  They are also stingy with their appetizer side dishes. Refuses to serve them until you get your meal and are reluctant to give you seconds.  Taste-wise they are definitely authentically Korean, just like the owners, who are super polite.   I probably won't be back, since there are so many places around the area that are so much better."}
{"text":"We tried Joon's tonight hoping for something that would keep up with some of the other great korean cheap-eats in Toronto.  Overall, I would give this place another try, but I wouldn't order a Joon special dish again because of the mounting costs in order to get a decent portion.  The Food:  The portions were a little small. We had a double order of the Joon special original spicy chicken along with rice. The food was tasty. The kimchi was very nice. The mashed potatoes were not very good. They don't put out as many side dishes as other places.  The service:  Our server was friendly. The side dishes came out late.  The Price:  There were a lot of hidden costs. You have to pay 2$ for each portion of steamed rice, and if you want a decent portion for the meal we ordered you should add on vegetables, noodles, etc, for 2$ each also.  Like a lot of korean places, if you order a \"cooking\" dish like the one we got, you have to order two portions of the same dish. Unlike other places, you can't mix and match, so they really should just double the prices on that section of the menu and recommend it as a sharing dish since you can;t order a single portion anyway."}
{"text":"First time here on a Sunday, and I called in advanced to see if they would take reservations. The person on the phone said \"no, not on weekends\". And then I continued to ask if it's usually really busy on Sunday's at a certain time and she tells me yes but today she doesn't know...-_- .? What is that suppose to mean. Lol anyways, when I got there it was moderately busy they had a few tables left that filled up shortly. Pretty friendly service. You can get refills of the side dishes they offer. We ordered the dak galbi with ramen, cheese and rice cakes. I personally expected more I guess after all the hype I've heard about this dish. I thought it was pretty good- didn't \"wow\" me though. Definitely a dish I've never tried at any other Korean restaurants and definitely worth a try. I will probably go back once in a while."}
{"text":"I got to try dakgalbi for the first time ever, here. My friend and I ordered 2 servings of this dish, along with cheese and noodles (which costed extra). It was really good, I liked the amount of cabbage they out in. When it first arrived to the table, I was a bit disappointed because I expected there to be more. I was wrong, we almost couldn't finish the dish at the end. I found it interesting that the ladies there prepped the dish somewhere else (add the ingredients and thoroughly mix them) then sent it to the customer's table.   By the way, their side dishes are really good, especially the sweet mashed potatoes!!"}
{"text":"I loved their schmorgashboard of ramen,  cheese,  chicken,  rice sticks and sweet potato in one dish!  It's the popular item to order and it's just delicious when hitting it up late night."}
{"text":"My friend suggested this place and I decided to search it up on yelp.  Most reviews were positive and I was convinced. So I decided to have dinner here with two of my friends today. The food was decent until the end... It was definitely not a sanitary place to eat.   I ordered a bibimbap with beef and assorted veges.  The presentation was neat and colourful.  The portion was bigger than other bibimbaps I've had in other korean restaurants. I was very pleased until I reached the end.  As I was digging towards the bottom of my meal I saw something that looked like a bug. I closely examined it and it was certainly a bug. I dug through my rice and found another tiny bug. I just lost my appetite right there. This meal also came with a small bowl of soup which was very peppery. Initially, I thought the black dots were grounded pepper but, when I took a closer look it was a tiny fruit fly playing camouflage. I felt disgusted and wondered how many bugs I had aten tonight...   I told one of the staff members about the bugs in my food. She told me it just flew in after I finished eating since it was summer, it was hot out and their doors were opened. However, I told her that this wasn't the case. I found the bugs at the bottom of my bowl that were stuck to the rice. I didn't make a big commotion out of it since I just wanted her to be aware of the sanitary level that's in their restaurant. In the end she apologized.   My friends ordered one of Joon's special. It was a platter of seafood, chicken and chewy noodles topped with cheese and a non-spicy sauce. It was cooked by a gas stove. The noodles tasted great however, the sauce was too sweet and salty to our liking. The baby octopus was a bit over cooked. Overall, we concluded that it was mediocre.   After this experience, I won't be visiting this location again. Perhaps another Joon's..."}
{"text":"What is Joon's known for?! DakGalbee!!!   My friends and I usually order the Seafood DakGalbee with cheese, rice cakes and Joon's special sauce. There's an extra cost for the cheese and rice cakes however, it's all worth it!! The first time I had it, it was wayyyyy to sweet. The second time was just right! (I guess, the taste varies at each location...)  We ordered 3 portions for 4 people and boy, we were full by the end. It was a good amount split between 4 people. We were struggling to finish it! It was not overly spicy however, it was a bit salty. Overall, it was a tasty and satisfying meal! Very affordable - about 10 bucks per person. Prior to our Seafood DakGalbee, side dishes were served. We had the mashed potato, kimchi, seaweed and sweet-sour radish. Honestly, the side dishes were not the best compared to the ones I've had at other Korean restaurants.  One thing that was pretty disappointing was the wait time for our food. It took forever for our food to arrive. We waited for at least 30mins and all we had on our table was water... However, they do give you a new bottle of water without you having to ask for it every time when its empty.  Overall, I'd come here again just because DakGalbee is so BOMB!!"}
{"text":"Came here twice and ordered the Dak Gal Bee both times. Although it was good, it's a bit expensive especially for the portion you're getting since you still would have to add on more toppings to make it worth it. The Kimchi Fried Rice was good though. It's accessible because it's right outside of Sheppard-Yonge station and there's a lot if parking (that you would have to pay for) around, however the restaurant is really small. But you get seated fast because it's rarely full.  Overall it was pretty average."}
{"text":"The one thing I order is the table top cooking with chicken and seafood. From my experience, the portions are not properly measured. If you order 2 portions, they cook in one frying pan. If you order 3 portions, they use the same size frying pan.   The appetizer selection isn't very wide. The sweet mashed potatoes are my favourite. As I approach the 3rd plate of mashed potato, the waitress cut me off... There were 4 of us, so 3 plates of mashed potato seems fair to be shared between 3 people.  We ordered the original spicy since not everyone on the table can handle the heat, but a friend of mine loves the burn so we asked the waitress to bring us a side of the special joon's spicy sauce. The server canme back with a Siracha in her hand  and apologized stating the manager refused to give us the spicy sauce.... poor customer service in Asian restaurants are expected.   I know I've been complaining about their service but still gave them a 3-star anyway, but I solely rate based on food quality since I believe a restaurant shouldn't suffer from getting crappy reviews because of the sloppy service from their workers. If  you've never been here, I would highly recommend the \"exotic\" table-top cooking experience that's not offered elsewhere. I wouldn't eat this all the time though, since the flavour of the sauce is bold and become very repetitive.  As for value, the basic is about $10/portion, but you have the option to add extra ingredients for a little extra $. I am a cheese fanatic so I would always get double cheese along with noodle as a carb. This adds up to about $15-20 pp, which is pretty pricey considering it's korean food.  You can easily make this at home for under $5."}
{"text":"Nice choice for cheese-pot lover. Good for dinner with 3-6 people"}
{"text":"Dak Gal Bee is the only thing you should order at Joons Restaurant doesn't matter when or who you come with. Oh of course if you are like me, here as a single diner... you would have stuck with one of their entrees...  The photos in front of the restaurant does looks so much better than the   Jjambbong ($6.75) was sad. I can barely found any seafood there and the instant ramen is just as good as what my Yelp friend have been making for me.  While I finished my noodle soup in record speed and down all the banchen. I couldn't stop admiring the other table at the corner that was enjoying their Dak Gal Bee!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Joons as well as to their other location in Koreatown on Bloor St. several times. I always get the Dak Gal Bee (either JS1 with chicken or JS2 which has addtional seafood) and enjoy both. I see many others complaining about the size of the portions, but I find them to be enough. Two portions for two people for lunch was more than sufficient, and even two portions for three people for dinner plus a side of dumplings was fine too. The best way to enjoy this dish: make sure you add on rice cakes, cheese and instant noodles. The rice cakes are deliciously chewy, and the instant noodles help soak up all the extra sauce (made the mistake of not getting noodles the first time, and it was just way too saucy and salty.) Plus you just can't go wrong with extra cheese. :D While some traditionalists might argue that this isn't the most authentic way to enjoy Dak Gal Bee, I still say the add ons are what make the dish good here!  As a side note, they have this mashed potato side dish which is sooo good, oddly sweet but so delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent, moderately priced Korean restaurant. Service is fast, food is tasty, and the location is great.   Both times I've been there I've had the bulgogi. The meat is always juicy, tender and flavourful. My big problem with Joons is their white rice. They pre-cook it and then put it in a big container for god knows how long. When the rice gets to your table, it is cold and not very fresh. I'll still eat it because I'm a sucker for rice, but I'd prefer if they made it when you ordered it. Everyone knows it doesn't take very long to make white rice.At least warm it up before putting it on the plate, Joons!   Joons is known for their table-top cooking, but because I haven't had it, I can't comment on it. It seems to be fairly popular (and it looks delicious from a distance) so I recommend trying the table top special instead of the bulgogi. Just avoid ordering anything that has white rice, and you'll be okay.  Be advised: they only take cash. There's an ATM inside, but it seldom works."}
{"text":"They have a quick service and good food for a relatively good price. It is too bad that they are closing their downtown location."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and got the beef & glass noodles, which came with a bowl of rice ($8.95). Taste was alright and it was reasonably priced.   Taste:  3/5 Service: 3/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Value for Money: 3/5 Would I come again: Yes, to try their dak gal bee."}
{"text":"Good Korean food - the dak gal bee was good and the rice cakes with noodles made it delicious.  I'm a big eater so it's enough for one and a half persons. On average it should serve two people.  You can get it non spicey which was good for people who didn't like their food hot.   My friend got a bimbimbap and you can never go wrong with that.   Service could be a bit quicker as we waited a good 20 minutes for our food to come."}
{"text":"Decided to try Joons after reading some reviews on their DaK Gal Bee (JS-1). Service was very friendly and quick, I especially like how they leave a bottle of water at your table so you don't have to constantly ask for a refill. The JapChae glass noodles came out quickly but were a bit too sticky for my liking. It made it hard to swallow. The Dak Gal Bee came shortly after and despite all the other reviews it was a good portion size for two people, an overall heavy dish. The ramen noodles were a staple piece, so I definitely recommend getting those as a side. The flavour for both dishes were very sweet so half way through it got too much to finish. In general an alright Korean comfort food restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review on my toilet that I almost destroyed in the last 7 hours. Let me put it this way, my stomach is made of steel and if your food can give me diarrhea, it means I'd never come again and tell all my friends not to go.    I've been to Joons couple times 4 years ago and I'm finally back in the hood so hey let's try out! My boyfriend and I went there yesterday on our anniversary and ordered the table cooking thing with beef and octopus. It's $13.95 per portion and we added cheese and noodles. Service was slow. Requested to refill the side dishes and took them 15 mins to get the side dishes to my table. And the table cooking dish.. Overpriced. Portion was soooo little and whatever you add on you pay extra. Cabbage was undercooked. The flavour was great. What I did not expect is my stomach started acting up at 3am. So was my boyfriend's. Hence 1 star, will never go again. Don't even know if we could go on our road trip today just because of this meal."}
{"text":"Terrible. I ate there once 5 years ago and didnt like it. But then I decided to give it another chance. I had the stir fry pork dish and I felt sick and had to run to washroom shortly after that. I don`t know what they used to cook the pork dish. If you dont want to get sick, avoid that place and go to the other korean restaurant right beside it."}
{"text":"Usually come here to get the dakgalbi as it's their staple but my recent visit was a bit underwhelming.  Seems like portions have decreased a bit (is it not sweet potato season guys????) and very sadly, our rice cakes were undercooked. If you're here for the first time, I'd recommend the chicken dakgalbi, and you must add the cheese and ramen!! Skip the seafood option as we only got like what, 5 tiny pieces of baby octopus.  This is usually the only place I'll come to for dakgalbi so it'll still do but on the hunt for a better place."}
{"text":"We ordered kimchi jjigae( kimchi soup) ,  toboki and Kamja tang( pork bone soup)  Toboki is sweeter here not that spicy but still pretty good  The portion here are smaller,and they only provide four side dishes.   Wouldn't recommend this place in north York finch area, there are many other better restaurants with larger portion and cheaper price here."}
{"text":"Joons unfortunately does not taste as good as it used to. Came here on a Friday night and it wasn't busy at all. However, they still seemed understaffed and took a while to even start us with water. We ordered the dakgalbi with teriyaki chicken, and came with watered down teriyaki sauce. I mean, you can barely even taste the sauce. Another downside is they limit only one noodle selection per pan. I was really looking forward to eating here that night but unfortunately due to this experience, we won't be returning again."}
{"text":"So excited I was able to check this place out while I was in Toronto this past weekend. I have been craving duk galbi for about 8 months now and they have it - Bingo! Having said that, I had really high expectations for this place. I did my research because I knew coming to Koreatown, I knew what I wanted and I knew how I wanted it to taste... like it does back in Korea. But it was just \"meh\"...  My friend (who I met while living overseas) and I went for dinner... we ordered two orders with gogoma (sweet potato), tteok, ramien, vegetables, bap (rice) and a beer each. First off, I understand it's going to be more expensive than what we were used to back in Korea but when the bill came to $60, I was truly taken aback. Also, when we tried to use our Korean like old times, they looked at us funny and judgy even though both of us are well-versed in Korean food ordering. When I go to Korean restaurants in Halifax and order in Korean they're overjoyed - so I was a bit disappointed with that.  The duk galbi overall was good and the service was decent but it wasn't as authentic as I had anticipated. So meh... AND WARNING - Cash only."}
{"text":"Decent food (especially since there are no other dak galbi places in Toronto) but service is TERRIBLE and portions are tiny!!!  I've been here with just one other person, and another time with a large group and both times we weren't served enough food.  Miraculously, a pan of dak galbi with 2 portions is exactly the same size as one with 3 portions (with the same kind of meat and exact same add-ons).  Why???  WHY would I pay 50% more to get the same amount of food?!  Note that 2 portions is *barely* enough food for 2 adults.  The kicker is that because we discovered when the food arrived that it wasn't enough, we asked for the menu so that we could order more food and we were told that we weren't allowed to!  What restaurant only allows people to order just once?  Especially when their portions are miniscule!  And WHY didn't they tell us so at the beginning or state it somehwere on their menu?!  I make my own dak galbi at home now.  It's easy to make, it tastes way better, the portions are appropriate, it's cheaper, and I can put whatever in it I want.  I don't understand why veggies cost extra for dak galbi at Joons.  That's totally unreasonable to me too.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm just a-OK with dak galbi, but my boyfriend loves it, so we come here pretty often. It's a filling dish, so we always order only 1 bowl of rice and split it. We always go for the original dak galbi (#JS3) and add rice cakes, noodles, and cheese into the mixture. We used to order seafood dakgalbi (#JS4) but we stopped because the seafood (squid and shrimp?) didn't cook properly and we got this \"artificial\" taste from them. So screw that, lets just stick with the chicken :) If you order what I order, your tab will come to just under $30. A little expensive, imo :(  But kuddos to the servers. They're very energetic and attentive! :)"}
