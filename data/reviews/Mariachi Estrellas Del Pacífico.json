{"text":"We hired Mariachi Del Pacifico to provide musical entertainment for a pre-wedding meet and greet in San Diego.   The music was wonderful.  Traditional mariachi  played by talented musicians and wonderful vocal arrangements.   We and our guests danced and were entertained!  The band and their music made a wonderful start to our son's wedding weekend.  Everyone loved the band!  Thank you, Mariachi Del Pacifico!"}

{"text":"Disappointing ....have left several messages for this business to contact me, as I am looking to hire a mariachi for our wedding.  NOTHING...no return on my phone calls or my emails requesting their availability.  Guess they're not interested in growing their business........"}
