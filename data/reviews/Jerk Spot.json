{"text":"The Jerk Spot single handedly defines \"hit and miss\" each time I visit. The menu is meticulously categorized into curries, sandwiches, roti's, snacks and thus its fair that this review be the same.  Category 1: Taste  Let it be noted that Jerk Spot has tried to OD me on salt many times. One such time, I went all experimental and tried adding milk to salvage a $10 meal and douse out the sodium fire running through my bloodstream. Let's just say that mixing milk and jerk spices wasnt one of my more brilliant moments.  Category 2: Structure  Instance 1: Jerk chicken roti. Ok I will admit it, the jerk chicken here is really good. The spices are just right and if you can overlook the salt content, you get a more than edible jerk chicken. However, if you intend to eat this in roti form, you can forget about it unless you want to be covered in bright orange oily goo inside and out.  Instance 2: After my jerk chicken roti experience, I decided to stick with the tried and true curry chicken roti. What I ended up with was curry chicken goo that made a clean and clear escape from the roti shell in 2 seconds flat. Bizarre.  Category 3: Outlook  One thing Jerk spot has that no one else does: Open on sundays till 3am. The caribbean food situation in downtown toronto is tragic on the weekends so the Jerk Spot is a keeper as long as you stick to the dinners with rice and meat and dont mind risking high blood pressure in the process."}
{"text":"Food was not up good at all.  The boneless jerk chicken sandwich for $5 was full of bones.  Taste was not that  great either.  I went back to show them that there was bones and they said that's how it comes.  Customer service was horrible.  Was not willing to remake the sandwich or even compensate.  Will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Beat jerk chicken sandwich in the city hands down. Great staff, good atmosphere. When I'm in the Neighbourhood I take whoever is with me"}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed with this place now and won't be going back. I feel cheated. So, I tried Jerk Spot a few years ago and enjoyed their curry roti so I made a point of travelling from cabbagetown for a repeat meal tonight. I ordered their chicken curry roti (breast meat) which was about $8.49. I noticed that she was working fast punching it in so I wouldn't see that she actually charged me $8.99. I figured that price already included the tax so I didn't think anything of it at the time but nope just overcharged. So I get my meal home only to realize they gave me the jerk pork (or chicken - hard to tell) roti special which was only $4.99. It was way too spicy for what I was expecting to eat that day so I couldn't even get through half. My husband had to give me part of his dinner. I feel like they were working me for extra money because I was the only customer ordering at the time and there is no way \"chicken curry roti breast meat\" could be mistaken for \"jerk pork special.\" Like other reviewers have said there were only two potatoes in the roti and with that spice I was dying for some potatoes to kill the heat.   Overall, if you could get over the heat the flavour was decent just don't expect potatoes, watch what you are being charged and check your meal before you leave."}
{"text":"Do not eat at the jerk spot... If u enjoy eating week old food that's not stored properly go a head , more times the food is stale as shit people complain are getting sick, who serves plantains black as far n a week old never mind the fact the food isn't even cooked at the Baldwin location it's cooked else where n brought to this location the staff isn't respected or taken care of hence y no one cares to take pride in their work ..."}
{"text":"10 out of 10 times this place is a MISS! I continuously warn my co-workers about eating here as I do not wish to introduce people to Jamaican food from this place...and of course they don't listen and then complain to me after they buy it!  Service is -0...yes it is possible for service to be this bad.   The \"slaw\" is pureed carrots and cabbage...wtf?? sorry NO ONE in Jamaica or any Jamaican restaurants make slaw this way, EVER! The \"jerk\" chicken is more like a overly spicy stew chicken. The jerk pork is very dry and over cooked. The rice, it's like they take the grains of the rice and cut them in half, I have never seen rice like this before. The curry chicken is incredibly vexing...I was extremely pissed off the first, and last time I had it...how could you mess up curry chicken? boneless my ass!! And by the way, one tiny chicken breast?? I dont think so! I kept giving this place a chance because I have never been to a Jamaican restaurant, run by Jamaicans, that served bad food like this.   I miss The Ackee Tree badly, 10 out of 10, my lunches were perfection and until we finally get a proper fridge in my office so that I can bring real food, this is the only Caribbean restaurant in walking distance (from what I know anyway).  I would love to give this place a higher ranking, but sorry, not gonna happen. If you want proper Jamaican food for lunch that is somewhat int he area, then go to Ritz."}
{"text":"Get a chicken plate and make sure it is spicy.  A large plate is massive and the menu is pretty large.  Lunch has some good deals.  My only complaint is that there are not many places to eat inside, but overall one of my favorite places to eat for a quick cheap meal."}
{"text":"Really salty and overpriced for the extra small jerk chicken. The sauce was much too salty and the peas did. It look appeasing. Advertise as 5.99 but the total ended up being $7.76."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you, this is NOT a massage parlor, but you will have an explosive experience if you go inside. The best Jerk plate I have had... Ive had many. You will see all the foolish people at burrito boys downstairs as you enter giving you a funny look while you go upstairs to the Spot. Don't let it deter you, Jerk Spot is better than a poor mans Chipotle any day. Order a coconut water to complete the island experience."}
{"text":"Yuck  The worst roti I'd ever had. It was huge though.  the shredded curry chicken tasted like the meat straight from a Campbell soup can. It was very salty and inedible.  We shared one thankfully .. ate just the roti shell and threw out the rest making a big thud in the garbage when we left."}
{"text":"I have been to this place 3 times and I want to keep going back! I had the jerk chicken dinner and it's amazing. Don't let the look of the place fool you!"}
{"text":"I wish I could love this place. I was going to give it 2-3 stars. I had the curry chicken roti. The shell was pretty decent though overcooked in place. The chicken filling tasted entirely like salt. But the reason I gave one star is that halfway through my roti, I discovered something that I'm almost certain is a mouse poop underneath the roti.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Greasiest roti ever. Tasty, but a pool of clear yellow oil awaits you if you order this lipid laden lunch."}
{"text":"I only go in for the spicy beef patty, I think it's the best in the city and I never ever leave Kensington without having one. I will grab one even if we just came out of a restaurant. Staff is friendly, but then again my routine never takes us past; \"Hey may I please have a spicy\", \"$1.50 (or how much ever it is)\", \"Thank you\"."}
{"text":"I went in on a Saturday and had their special; jerk chicken roti. For 6.99, this was one of the best meals I've ever had. And definitely the best chicken roti I've ever had. I don't understand why there isn't a lineup out the door for this place. What a deal. I'm a 40 minute walk from this place but I'll definitely be back.  Seriously, this place is the place for jerk chicken. So damn good."}
{"text":"Having grown up in the Caribbean, I'd like to think that I know good West Indian curry when I taste it. I came by the Jerk Spot today while on my way to pick up some Mother's Day flowers. I always pass by and I decided to go in today. I thought they had doubles for some reason, but they don't. I ordered a chicken roti which was meh... I've had better. The chicken was shredded, not much curry flavor, and it was very salty with a few potatoes in it. It was served in a styrofoam container - rather than the traditional wax paper you would get if you were to order this in the Caribbean. The roti skin was also very dry.  I would definitely come by to try the lunch/dinner dishes - I'd think that they'd be better with the more traditional Jamaican dishes?   Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Left feeling I got scammed. Go ahead and try it if after drowning kittens, but for people who aren't assholes I would not recommend this place at all.   It's so bad, if this was being served in a prison for child molesters I would start a fund to give them some proper food.  It's so bad, I would rather take a meal from this place anally instead of orally. And I'm terrified of anal suppositories.   It's so bad, if I had to choose between patronizing this place and eating my parents, I would consider eating my parents for more than 10 seconds before buying a meal from this place. I love my parents. But this place is pretty terrible.  Here is my story:   I ordered a chicken sandwich for 5.65 including tax. I got something the size of my bad (about 5 inches long, 3 inches wide, in a taco shape) with 2 milimeters of chicken shreds from a chicken leg back. Chicken was moist, but there was also sauce, but that's all I'm gonna give it.   Picture of chicken sandwich had veggies, an entire chicken leg, and coleslaw as a side. I paid for that. Instead I got some elementary school girl's lunch. No veggies, no coleslaw, NOThiNG but a shitty little piece of bread (not even two pieces of bread! it's like one of those bread-taco things) with more bread than chicken.   Well fuck. I was pretty fucking angry. I came on here and made this post, thinking that I may be a tad bit unfair. But honestly, I got lied to. I had a set budget for lunch and I wasted it on this shitcrap fuck of a jerk chicken shop. Fuck the shitty service (no smile, minimal words, which is alright if you don't scam me). Fuck the mediocre bread and minimal taste chicken. Fuck this place."}
{"text":"I ordered small jerk chicken breast with rice and peas (kidney beans). Husband ordered curry chicken roti. We were a little confused on pricing but it was just over 20. Big portions! I ended up getting it to go and feasted on and off for 5 hours. It had A LOT of little bones in it and I was scared for my life eating it but it was really good. I'm not dying to go back but I'd recommend the place. The people working and dining there were very pleasant!"}
{"text":"So I saw this place while dropping my friend off after a night out, and I promised myself I would check it out, so I pulled up around 3am and placed an order for a large jerk chicken and took it home with me to eat.    The smells wafting from the food parcel during the drive home were making me go insane; it was a struggle for me not to dig into the food during the red lights.  In any case, I got home and tore into the food.  I was so hungry that I didn't care that the chicken was truly jerk chicken (made me think back to the two Jamaican guys who warned me as I entered the place, that it wasn't good food) and kept eating.  I told myself that given how late it was, and how large the portions were, that I should only eat half.  However, even if the food wasn't authentic Jamaican, it still went down pretty good and I couldn't stop myself from devouring pretty much the entire portion.  While I wouldn't rush back there if I were craving Jerk chicken, if I were in the Entertainment district after clubs close and I had a food craving, there's a pretty good chance I would go back. :)"}
{"text":"I dunno about this place - it really is a HIT and Miss.You will either have a great experience or not so great experience. I have had jerk chicken /goat here a few times now, and sometimes I just want to cry and worry about the trip I'm going to have to make to the toilet once I'm done, and some times, I wonder if it is jerked at all.  I'm not entirely sure if the staff realize not only do they look like they want to just shoot themselves that I am in there to order when you walk in, but stare at you like I'm just not ordering quick enough. Mumbling under your breath doesn't help either."}
{"text":"Ox tail was great. Little hole in the wall place in Augusta.   Definitely worth the traffic and lack of parking."}
{"text":"I stole a few bites from my bf's jerk chicken roti. Full of spicy goodness! I'm going to get a plate of my own when I visit again."}
{"text":"It's not easy to find a Jamaican restaurant that will deliver and even harder to find one that delivers and has awesome authentic food. The Jerk Spot is both of these things.  The delievery fee of $5 may be a little steep, but I would say it's worth it if you're ordering for a group. The jerk chicken isn't overly spicy but still has a good kick and the rice and beans it's served with is done well. The goat roti was PHENOMENAL, had some awesome spice factor going on and was massive (I got a good 3 meals out of it). I also got side orders of fried plantain and coleslaw which were both delicious.  I found the prices to be incredibly reasonable for the portions and the food very satisfying. Delivery was ontime and the driver was great.  They are definitely my go-to for Jamaican from now on."}
{"text":"There are so many places to eat nearby Jerk Spot is easily overlooked.  This place is an understated gem.  The prices are reasonable.  The service was kind.  The seating is plentiful.  And the food was great-- authentic jerk seasoning, generous rice and peas, lots of plantains.  Next time you working up an appetite shopping in #KensingtonMarket pass by all the places that make you stand outside eating on the sidewalk.  The #JerkSpot has food, service and seats for you.  #foodtourism #chifoodie"}
{"text":"been searching for the perfect roti for a while now in the market so I had high hopes when I tried this place. I order the chicken curry roti and I believe the total was somewhere near 10 or 11 bucks . the roti itself was very good but unfortunately the filling was super dry and very salty. so dry in fact  that  I decided not to eat it then  and to save it for later when I got home so I could salvage it by adding some sauce.  don't think I'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this place off and on for about 4 years now and I agree with the other reviews that call this place the definition of hit or miss. Over the last 2 years the quality and consistency has definitely dropped. Some times the jerk chicken tastes good and sometimes its just too salty and dry. Although the goat curry is consistently over salted (and smells like raw turmeric) , so I have stopped ordering it.  The only consistent thing in all the other items they sell is the generous amounts of salt that they use.   The patties here are pretty good , but I doubt they make it in house.  At 3 am , when not much else is open this might be the only option, in that case only get the patties and tiger malt and run out of there.  But I can no longer justify going here sober."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple times, but both times I left with more food that I should have eaten in one sitting...  Well, more like 2 sittings!  But that didn't stop me from cramming it down.  It's not fancy, it's not expensive, it's simple, tasty and delicious.  I've had a few varieties of meats with the dirty rice n' beans.  Yum!  I think I'll go here for lunch today!"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall in Kensington. The first time I came across this spot, it was because I wanted to introduce some friends to jerk, but Rasta Pasta was closed. However, wasn't disappointed, although I like the jerk close to home better (Pam's Caribbean).  The most recent time, we got jerk chicken and oxtail. I love oxtail, and the best part is sucking on the bones! In the roti, however, there was only 1 tiny measly bone :(  I was also looking forward to Caribbean coleslaw, with its hint of sweetness, made with coconut milk. However, we only got a (very tiny) container, and I think it was normal slaw, made with mayo.  One redeeming quality about the time we visited last was the young man at the counter (James). Pretty sure he's only there for the late night shifts, but he was very friendly and I'd love to see him again."}
{"text":"The food is decent. I got the jerk chicken with rice that came with a small cup of cabbage. The jerk chicken could have more flavor. Besides that it is a good spot to for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Pretty good Caribbean in Kensington. I find their portions to be more than generous and the food is always fresh and tasty. The jerk chicken at this place isn't a style that is my favourite, but is more of a roasted chicken than the flame-charred style I've always preferred. That being said, the fried chicken is delicious and their curry is tender, flavourful and satisfying. The curry is definitely the standout for me. Worth a shot."}
{"text":"I had the goat curry dinner. The goat was very tender and the sauce was lovely with the rice and peas. They even threw in some free veggies for me! Staff was very friendly but I think the food was a bit overpriced. I went on a very hot day in the summer and they didn't have AC so I had to take my meal home."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  I ordered Curry Goat with white rice and coleslaw.  The goat was great, the flavour was there but I have had better.  The flavour seemed like was some substitutes, the sauce was not as creamy.  The rice was hard and not fluffy.  For the price of $8 extra small size it wasn't really worth it.  The coleslaw was very good.  My friend the roti with curry chicken.  The flavour was there, but there was a lot bones which is not traditionally roti.  That was disappointing.    Overall it is an ok place, just need to work on the little things.  One thing is true, from one Yelper in other reviews to myself they need to take out the bones.  Only would return for lunch special."}
{"text":"So came here for a quick lunch as I was heading to.... club monaco, lol don't hate. =P  I got their Jerk Chicken lunch special which was $5-6 after tax.  The Jerk Chicken itself wasn't too bad in flavour but found it really really dry.  They do put a ton of gravy on it.  And is it me or does the gravy taste a little... tangy.  The gravy was kinda orange and oily which didn't help in the appearance category.  The lunch special will fill you, but I would recommend visiting other places if you're looking for jerk chicken.  I haven't tried the other menu items, so who knows maybe they're better?  It's unfortunate cause the people were nice and all, but the food was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Many reviews say this place is hit or miss.  I guess I caught it during a \"miss\".   I'm *so* disappointed -- I wanted to love this place.  The other Jamaican place nearby, The Ackee Tree, has good food and crappy service.   This place has good service and mediocre food.  Jerk Pork: C+ Nicely spiced by dry, dry, dry.  I my mouth felt parched eating the jerk pork.  I couldn't finish my meal.  I threw half of it away because the meat was just so dry!  Oxtail: B+ So sad.  The oxtail at any Jamaican place should be the tour de force.  Meaty, fatty, tasty, spicy, deliciousy.  This one?  It was good.  But it didn't blow me away like oxtail normally does.  I was *so* disappointed.  Oxtail is my favorite dish in Jamaican places, and I was expecting much better.  Boo hoo!   :-(  I probably won't be coming back.  I probably won't be coming back to The Ackee Tree either.  So much for Jamaican food in Toronto."}
