{"text":"I tempered my expectations based on some reviews/complaints, but found the ramen to be very good. I had the Santouka Ramen and thought the broth was tasty and had a pretty good kick. I saw some people mention that the noodles weren't what they were expecting, but I thought the Soba noodles were good and comparable to most of the better ramen I've had in NYC. $14 is steep IMO, but I'll be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice but the food isn't that great. We ordered 2 things, the  eel donburi and the sushi platter. The Eel donburi looked great but was tooooooooo sweet. It tasted as though they poured too much sauce. After mixing everything, the rice was totally dark brown covered in sweet sauce. We couldn't continue eating due to the sweetness so we asked for more rice to mask the sweetness. It just ended up tasting like 90%rice and 10%eel. Very little eel included. I would NOT RECOMMEND this dish but the sushi platter seemed fine."}
{"text":"I love this little joint!. The staff is always very inviting and kind. Over the top nice. The food has been great both times I have eaten there. And the price is right. Finally, a good place to get lunch in Shadyside!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place minus 5 stars I would!!! Very rude and unprofessional service. They need a class in manners. Will not recommend and never return!"}
{"text":"Great sushi selection along with interesting fish specials. The food was great as well as the environment. Drinks looked good as well. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Just had the sashimi teishoku for lunch.  I am a sushi snob because I am often in Japan and eat it at the tsukiji fish market, so I usually avoid sushi in the u.s. altogether.  But I happened to be walking past, so I gave it a try.  I was very impressed.  The owner and chef are from Taiwan, where sushi is done very well, and the chef studied for 12 years in Japan.  It shows.  No warm stale micro thin sashimi here and the presentation was a real surprise for the price."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant after hearing about.  We sat at the bar and was surprised by the presentation, knowledge of cuisine and the friendliness of the bar tender Stern.  This is truly a great experience and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been struggling to find good quality sushi in the burgh, and I think this place may be my new go to! I ordered the sashimi donburi and hot and sour soup - the meal comes with choice of soup, love that.   Food takeaways: Their fish is very fresh and their house soy sauce is good enough to drink. Seriously, I definitely consumed more of that sensational soy than would be recommended by a physician. The soup was very tasty and the sashimi was obviously high quality. My only complaint with the food was that the single slice of \"salmon\" in my dish was clearly the last fatty end hunk that should have been trimmed off before they even turned that fish into sushi. It was pretty heavily laced with white fat and the back of the cut was all white and tough. Bummer, since I'm a salmon lover. Would have preferred if they just replaced the salmon with something else if they were out or running low. That being said, I would order it again and am definitely coming back for some of the other mouth watering dishes being whisked by to other tables.    Service takeaways: Meh? It is a very small establishment, yet I waited a good five minutes before even seeing a server or bartender to be seated...from signs in the window, looks like they're hiring so maybe they're just under staffed right now. Also, my server wouldn't seat me at one of the three available bar high tops insisting they wanted to save those for a party larger than one. I get it, I was dining alone. However, it was a pretty steady but not crazy busy Sunday night and there were plenty of available seats in the bar and dining room for bigger parties. I simply would have been more comfortable at one of the high tops. Also CASH ONLY which is a slight inconvenience to this card carrying millennial.   All in all, quite good! I'm willing to put up with weird service and a trip to the ATM for sushi this good. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Ginger Salad, Korean Kimchi, Beef Ramen and The Bare Alaskan Roll. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly. Some of the best ramen in the city. The service was polite and attentive. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"LOVE the food and service here! My boyfriend and I always come here and get their ramen bowls, which come with pork belly, an egg, tofu skin, corn, fish cakes, and a piece of seaweed, and you don't have to pay for any of those as an add-on! We've also tried their sushi and drinks, which don't disappoint either. We've always been served our food within minutes of ordering and the staff is very kind. I recommend this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"I've eaten sushi all over North America and am a bit of a snob. My tests focus on the scallops, uni, and rice. At this place they are perfect. This is beautifully presented melt in your mouth sushi- and reasonably priced. Yeah it's cash only, but that doesn't mean the food isn't outstanding. Go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and service! Ramen was outstanding, broth was tasty, noodles had amazing texture. Nice atmosphere for drinking and socializing"}
{"text":"Interestingly...I sat there for 15 mins, and nobody serves me. It is a new restaurant. Food tastes good, but their RAMEN is not good as others. I mean it is not real ramen, but the soup is good. Waiters still need to be trained. They donot accept credit card anymore. bring cash with you."}
{"text":"The quail and bacon yakitori was great along with our ramen and pork meals! They have a huge saki list along with unique Japanese drinks like yuzu and ume. The service was awesome and people very friendly. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to Pittsburgh and am so glad I got to try it on opening day! Given it was the first day, service/kitchen was a bit slow. Our server was really nice though and offered good suggestions. They have a nice selection of sake.   The yakatoris were all really good! We really enjoyed the quail egg wrapped bacon, lamb, pork, chicken, and chicken gizzard.  We got the miso ramen. I really like the toppings they add in it and the broth was really good. I didn't really like the noodles though. They were a bit soft and over cooked for my taste.  The sashimi teishoku was good! It came with vinegary rice, which is delicious with the sashimi. The egg custard side, miso soup, and salad were all really good too!   Overall, it was a great experience and I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"What a great experience. Just opened and expected some hitches in the service and speed from the sushi bar and kitchen but everything went like clockwork. The entire staff was so attentive, helpful, and above all knowledgeable from the waiter explaining the food selections, the saki expert explaining all of the saki choices; nothing comes even close in Pittsburgh!,  and finally the sushi chef dropping by to check on us. I regret getting the usual ginger salad and miso soup because, although it was good, I will not get it again so that I have room to try an additional dish-----or two. there is so much I have never seen on a Pittsburgh mene before. My sashimi platter was a work of art in addition to being fresh and tender. The oohs and ahas as the various dishes were brought through the restaurant was entertaining. The most outstanding and unique dish was the Seared Ahi Tuna Pichtashio. I will undoubtedly get it every time I return, which will be very soon!"}
{"text":"Food is really great. Los Angeles Ramen . But no credit cards? This is 2017 and this is also Walnut St, not some back alley establishment."}
{"text":"This is the first time I am here and I will definitely return! I read all the reviews before I came so I did not order any ramen. And I really love the omurice and the osake!  The service is good, not fantastic, but not bad either.  We ordered the Choyu Umei sake. It is a light and sweet sake, with a gentle taste of plum and the color of gold. It's very good and elegant. If you are a fan of Japanese osake, try this! Then we ordered some Japanese beer. You can't go wrong with the Asahi black. If you like bitter stout or strong, dry Belgium black beer, this might not be your favorite. But if you fancy a yummy, wheaty beer that's tender in texture, you will love the Asahi black. However, I don't like the Jap-Hi grapefruit beer my friend ordered. It tastes nothing different from Sprite.  For appetizer, we had the Japanese fried chicken, referred in their menu as Japanese basil chicken. I'm a huge fan of good Jap fried chicken or Karaage. Their chicken however is not traditional karaage. Instead, it's more Taiwanese than Japanese. But it is very tasty. I highly recommend that you ask for a side of mayonnaise to go with the chicken!  We also ordered the red snapper sashimi, yellowtail sashimi, tuna sashimi, shrimp sushi and Japanese scallop sushi. All good. Actually they are the best sashimi I've had in Pittsburgh, better than Chaya, Kiku, sushi too, Oishii and Fuku. I'm not a fan of tuna sashimi but I loooove their tuna. I really like the red snapper, the yellowtail and the scallop sushi as well! Soooo fresh!   We tried some skewers,too! They are better than the ones from Unami which are more expensive. We ordered the King oyster mushrooms, the needle mushrooms, the chicken w green onions, the pork w green onions, the beef and asparagus and the famous bacon and shrimp. Although everyone has been boosting the bacon and shrimp, I'd say it's just normally good. The surprise is really the green onion series, especially the pork one! A thin piece of pork with soft green onions wrapped inside, yaki to the best texture! I really love it. The mushrooms are not as good as I expected though, probably because they are already half cold when they are brought to us.  Me and my friend shared a rice with omelette, or the omurice. I have missed omurice soooo much since I moved to Pittsburgh 4 yrs ago. It is unbelievable that there was not even a single restaurant that sells omurice in Pittburgh! Tan's omurice is good with yummy chicken fried rice wrapped in tasty pan fried eggs with the ketchup and mayo on top, reminding me of the ones I had in China and Japan. If you have never had an omurice in your life, try this one because it's really quite authentic. It's served with a side soup.   All in all, this is a great place to go after work with your friends or colleagues, a runaway from your everyday peer pressure and stress from work! They have a wide selection of Japanese alcohol. Seriously, I can spend hours here just drinking their gentle Umei Sake. I did not try the ramen. But the food I ordered is all great and worthy of the price! I will definitely return. In fact I'll probably come again tomorrow."}
{"text":"In town visiting. It's a cozy little place, which is something I like in a sushi place. They have a full bar with a selection of specials and a flight of sake for happy hour. Menu is pretty typical sushi fare, with some items you don't normally see, such as ramen. It was a little warm out, so I got two sushi rolls. Fish tasted pretty fresh.  Selection of special rolls could have been a little more diverse, but I may be spoiled by my standby in my hometown.   Staff is super friendly.   Only pet peeve is that sushi is prepared in the kitchen. Most of the places I go to, it's prepared in front of you. But, they have a full bar, so maybe there isn't enough room for booze and fish.  I'd go back next time I'm back in town. Maybe even before I leave this week."}
{"text":"The food wasn't exactly the best thing I've ever had but it also wasn't terrible. Most memorable part of my visit here was the incredibly awkward service.   Our waiter was excruciatingly awkward, stopping over every second to see if we were ready to order. The attentiveness was appreciated but he must have came over 5 times within a 3 minute period and that's a bit much. Any questions we had on the menu weren't really answered either. Just plain awkward.   Now, the food is supposed to be small bites and I expected that coming in. I also expected every bite to be delicious and that sadly was not the case. We ordered some yakitori, a sushi roll, a rice bowl, and a teishoku. The flavors were not very memorable - just average.   Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. I'm just not sure if the food is really worth it."}
{"text":"One of the best Japanese restaurants in Pittsburgh, Try its tuna salad and banana row"}
{"text":"Extremely authentic japanese food at an affordable price! We had the LA udon, sashimi don, bacon on asparagus yakitori. They were delicious. I wish they took credit card though..."}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews before stopping in. At 1:00 on a weekday the place was empty. Really. Just me. Part of that can be attributed to a cash only policy in this day of credit cards. Dumb. The decor was nice and the restaurant was clean. Nice staff.  But the food was mediocre. Hot and sour soup was just okay, no noodles as accompaniment.  The pork belly bao buns were a major disappointment. The pork belly was WAY over cooked and tough. The buns were cold and dry with very little sauce, and a spicy mayo sauce at that. The lettuce, hoisin and cucumber promised were not there. I asked for a little more sauce (and added some soy sauce too) to make the buns swallow-able--they got stuck. If the buns had been good (and warm) I would have made this a regular lunch spot. As it is, I won't be back."}
{"text":"There are only around 5 restaurants in Pittsburgh selling Japanese ramen, and the ramen here is the most decent of them.  That being said, this place is way overpriced for the food quality, even in comparison with NYC.  I had the Tan Shoyu ramen ($12), the soup (it would be a disgrace to call it broth) tasted like seawater and there was only one piece of pork that was at most 4in^2 in area.  I've had way better ramen in NYC for less than this price.  The only saving grace is that the noodles didn't stink as much as Noodle Uchi's on Craig St."}
{"text":"I have been here last Wednesday. I order sashimi plate. It was so fresh. The sever was very friendly. Love to go back again."}
{"text":"Came here for sushi and left happy. The food was fresh and had a nice presentation. Full bar and friendly waitstaff, but almost a little too attentive. Would go back!"}
{"text":"I like to try places more than once before I review them, but I won't be going back to Tan Izakaya. I was interested in trying it out after I heard it was owned by the same people who own Everyday Noodles (I'm not even sure this is true because Everyday Noodles is AMAZING).   Okay, so first part of my underwhelming experience is the service. Our server stopped by maybe 10-15 times in the hour we were at the restaurant. Although she was *very* nice and polite, she was also somewhat awkward and a little annoying.   My friend ordered an old fashioned cocktail made with tea and told me it was very watery. I tried a sip and it tasted like a glass of ice water with half a shot of whiskey in it. The bartender at the bar must have noticed our conversation and came over with a new drink that was made with the correct tea mix. It was also kind of a weird interaction and although she was nice and the drink tasted good, we were both left dissatisfied with the experience.   The food was also just okay. I was not especially happy, but nothing tasted bad or left me feeling sick. Overall, I don't think I'm going to try Tan Izakaya again."}
{"text":"Despite all of the attention lavished on the Pittsburgh food scene recently, we still can't get a decent bowl of ramen in this town. In the case of Tan Izakaya, the situation is worse because they don't even seem to know what proper ramen is.  If you want ramen, don't eat here. We were served lukewarm spaghetti in a tasteless broth and were treated like idiots when we asked why they didn't use real ramen noodles. Soba and Udon are not used in any version of ramen. Period. Full stop. Their insistence that they're serving authentic ramen is as confusing as it is sad.   In addition to the fact that it wasn't actually what anyone would consider ramen, it wasn't even a very good version of noodle soup. Bland broth with no depth of flavor served over slimy pasta. The pork seemed ok, but there was so little of it that if it had been bad, I'm not sure I would have been able to tell.   I would--without hesitation--rather eat top ramen than what we were served. It was gross and hurt my feelings."}
{"text":"Best feature: Japanese beers on draft Worst feature: The food...  1. Ramen not made with ramen noodles. You get soba or udon.  The soba noodles were too soft and didn't have much texture. I like my ramen with fresh chewy noodles.   2. Wagyu is served with gold... Why? Wagyu IS gold in meat form! Also not great, don't believe it was fresh or perhaps it wasn't Japanese wagyu or a lower grade, I dunno.  3. Chicken heart and gizzards tasted like it was boiled only and not grilled. Texture was tough and the meat itself did not taste flavorful.  Would recommend for drinks but maybe not food."}
{"text":"I stopped into Tan Izakaya for lunch and was heartened to hear a proper \"irrashaimase!\" from the owner Mike Chen.    Great location and ambiance and I sat at the bar to order and to enjoy lunch.    Overall, it was a good experience but it was uneven to be sure.  I found it is newly opened so there are bound to be kinks to work out.  I ordered the miso soup, omurice and a selection of yakitori as well as kikusui saké.   The omurice was good - the filling was perfect but the topping of ketchup (which is normal) and mayonnaise and aonori (which is not) was interesting.  I prefer my omurice with ketchup only and the addition of mayonnaise and aonori was not bad but I didn't care for the combo.  The yakitori I had was the quail egg and bacon, the beef and asparagus, the shishito peppers and pork and green onion.  The meat (beef, pork) was cooked well except the bacon which was soggy and a bit greasy.  The shishito peppers were charred but had no salt or seasoning of any kind and so were flavorless.  The tare or glaze/sauce for the meat was shiny and pretty but also lacking in flavor.  I am half-Japanese and go to Japan yearly and cook a lot of Japanese food so I am very familiar with yakitori etc., the tare or sauce for yakitori is paramount and Tan Izakaya's tare is not up to par.  The good:    Service was good, nice variety of sakés and the menu looks good with a variety of items.  The bad:  Staff loudly discussing customer issues in earshot of diners - no customer wants to hear disparaging talk about ignorant customers regardless of the validity of the issues.  I agreed with what the staff were saying about ignorant customers but to hear it through 75% of my meal was not pleasant.    For a place that is newly opened, service and ambiance as well as the taste of the food is important - workplace politics should be kept behind kitchen doors.  I am sure that it will find it's stride and get better!"}
{"text":"Delicious new ramen place, and a lot of intriguing Japanese dishes on the menu, so I'll definitely be back to try more. Service is also quick and great. The only thing that sucks is that it's cash only. There is an ATM inside, but be prepared with cash if you want to avoid the surcharge. There's a PNC ATM on Walnut just around the corner so that might be a better option if you want to stop by and need cash!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Friday evening with my wife for dinner.  We were looking for a ramen place nearby whenever Tan Izakaya came up on Yelp.  It's located on S. Aiken street in Shadyside right near Walnut and I have to have been past it quite a few times before without noticing it. The inside of the restaurant is long and skinny with a bar dining area near the front, followed by a bar and then a dining room.  The restaurant walls are decorated with large bottles of sake and the doorways are covered with cloths of Japanese origin.  After perusing their expansive menu my wife and I decided to split the spicy tuna pizza and I followed that up by ordering the Los Angeles ramen for my entree while my wife went with the seafood ramen.  Shortly after ordering our appetizer pizza came to the table.  Since there wasn't any description on the menu for it we weren't really sure what to expect but it came out as a smallish pizza (think 6\" or so) and was cut into 8 pieces.  As for the taste, well it was really good.  It actually tasted like a spicy tuna roll on a pizza which was sort of weird but absolutely delicious.  Just as we were finishing it up our entrees came to the table.  According to the menu my Los Angeles ramen consisted of seaweed, tofu skin, coddled eggs, fish cake, corn, green onion, tempura fried basil chicken all in a miso wine broth.  My first bite of it left me rather disappointed as the whole thing was bland.  Hoping that was a mistake I took a few more bites and yep, it was super bland.  As a matter of a fact, the only parts that I did really enjoy were the coddled egg and tempura fried basil chicken.  Both of those were tasty and added something to the dish with the yolk from the egg adding some creaminess while the chicken had great flavor.  After finishing off my meal I then tried some of my wife's broth.  Wow, what a difference as it had layers of flavors and some spice to it.  So either I ordered the most boring broth ever or something wasn't right with it the night we visited.  The bottom line for me is that I might stop back here again in the future.  Based upon my ramen alone I probably would not but the combination of the pizza and the flavor of my wife's broth gives me hope that it could be a lot better."}
{"text":"As sad as I was to see Village Pizza go, I couldn't imagine that what would replace it would be 100 times better than drunken slices of Cheese & Pepperoni at 2am. Now, truth be told, no Pizza is bad Pizza at 2am, but what an awesome an necessary addition to the Shadyside neighborhood Tan Izakaya is!  Tan Izakaya is a small, but attractive Sushi/Ramen/Japanese fare restaurant, and the newest creation from Pittsburgh restauranteur Michael Chen. Chen is the same culinary genius that has brought to us the China Palace empire, as well as the now-defunct Tamari, and the popular Everyday Noodles in Squirrel Hill. When I heard Chen was behind the new endeavor, I knew that it wouldn't disappoint. Chen has a knack for producing a great product, with the right portion sizes for the right price.   Tan Izakaya offers everything from your standard sushi offerings, creative rolls, and the like. Anyone who remembers Tamari knows how great their sushi was, and the best way I can describe this place is that whoever was making the rolls at Tamari, is probably the exact guy making them here, because not only is the presentation excellent, but the quality is unmatched. And since the ownership is the same, I would have to assume there was some employee crossover after Tamari closed.   In paying homage to Tamari, and what really stood out to me from the menu were the Yakatori. If you are unfamiliar with Yakatori, but as I figured out quickly, think of the Robata skewers from Tamari. These are skewers in which you get 3-5 pieces of Meat/Vegatable/Seafood, grilled to perfection on a wooden stick. For 2 dollars each, what an easy way to try many different offerings. I recommend the Beef and Asparagus, the Lamb was phenomenal, and my favorite from Tamari were the bacon-wrapped Quail eggs. All come presented with a tereyaki (spelling?) glaze and are a great way to begin a meal.  In summary, if you liked and miss Tamari, have no fear. Chen took the best parts of that restaurant, shortened the menu, hired the same high-quality chefs, and opened its doors for you in Shadyside.  Full Bar with excellent beers on tap. Multiple HD tv's with good sight-lines for watching whatever event may be on. Has a sliding garage-style door that opens to the street for outdoor-esque seating."}
{"text":"Really good service which warrants the star...however, I had the sashimi platter and wound up with the worst...uhhhh...let's say that I was happy to be in a hotel with a toilet close by."}
{"text":"Solid, basic ramen. Egg cooked nicely. Takeout container very sturdy, broth also separated from noodles and other ingredients so they don't get soggy. Only thing I would change is: I wish they had mushrooms in the ramen. Will be back again to try the sushi, which looks great. (FYI I'm pretty sure PNC refunded my ATM fee there, so that's great!)"}
{"text":"The food was great, the sake was fantastic, and the service was wonderful. Our server really knew their stuff, had great suggestions on food, and could really describe the difference between the sakes. All around, this was a great dining experience and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and was highly disappointed. The service was subpar, and the dish that I ordered was probably one of my least favorite things that I have ever ordered in a restaurant. After asking our server for recommendations, I decided to try the \"popular\" omelette with rice. It was listed under rice bowls on the menu. There was no further description other than \"omelette with rice.\" I thought it was going to be a take on fried rice, but with the rice in the omelette. I was also expecting Japanese flavors... the omelette came out and it was covered in ketchup! I immediately sent it back since I loathe ketchup. I asked the server if the menu listed ketchup as an ingredient, and he said yes. He then offered to have it remade without the ketchup on top, and I agreed. I looked at the menu again, and there was no mention of ketchup. After about fifteen minutes, I received the new omelette, and the first bite wasn't bad. But, once I had a bite of the rice inside, I could taste ketchup! I had my boyfriend try it to make sure, and he agreed with me. I then asked the waiter if there was ketchup inside the omelette and he said yes! Now, I would think he would have told me, after the first omelette that there was also ketchup inside of the omelette! Needless to say, I didn't eat the second omelette either. He said that he could ask to take it off the bill, but seemed hesitant. I told him not to worry about it.  Our server seemed distracted during the whole experience. He brought me the wrong soup to begin with, and then called me sir when he brought out the second omelette. I'm not sure why he was so distracted because the restaurant was not busy. There was only one other table seated. My boyfriend had ramen and thought it was decent.  Though, we will not be returning. Unless one is in the mood for a ketchup omelette at a Japanese restaurant, I would definitely not recommend the dish that I ordered!"}
{"text":"Excellent find in Shadyside. The Sushi was terrific and so was the service. The sake menu is plentiful too."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was even in Shadyside, but glad to have discovered it today. The sushi and sashimi were so fresh and presented beautifully.  Our service was also excellent and great atmosphere. Next time I want to try the Raman."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Pittsburgh to get a decent ramen bar, so I was pleased to see this place open.   I'm still waiting.   I actually have no clue if the food is any good. It's quite possible they have the best ramen in the world outside of Japan. I wouldn't know because the hostess, or manager or whatever she was who greeted us was so rude we just turned around and left.   I was so frosted by the experience I won't be giving them a second chance. It actually makes me question whether or not I want to visit any of Mike Chen's restaurants - Everyday Noodles in Squirrel Hill and Sushi Too. I haven't tried every day noodles, but the last time I was in Sushi Too it was pedestrian and meh.   Mike - when you hire people like that, it really brings your judgement into question.   Maybe we can talk Eric Bruner-Yang of DC's Toki Underground into opening something here."}
{"text":"I was there for ramen, it has all the tools correct, but the noodle itself is not ramen or soba. though it's still good consider there is no place in pittsburgh serving real ramen"}
{"text":"I went with a party of 6 for lunch and we were seated immediately. We got the pork buns on the special menu for appetizer and they were good. But the waitress told us that it would be 4 buns for $8 when it was actually 2 buns, which I think is rather expensive. I got the Alaskan roll which was very tasty and a good portion. My friends got the santouka ramen and the LA ramen both of which my friends enjoyed. My friends who got the LA ramen asked if they could make it spicy, and the waitress told us that they could get the santouka sauce on the side. However, she did not tell us that extra sauces (including extra wasabi and ginger) would cost us two dollars each. The waitress and the manager were very friendly and removed that cost from our check.   Overall I thought that the food was tasty and the service was very nice. The atmosphere was chill although it was pretty dark inside. I would recommend this place for both ramen and sushi, although you should expect to pay a good amount of money (in cash only)!!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre food. Chirachi was cheep, only $13, but you get what you pay for. The fish was very sadly thinly sliced. Their uni (only 4 pieces on the $20 donburi with salmon roe, which was one of the highest priced dishes on the menu) had bitter aftertaste, so I do not recommend it. Salmon roe was unusually salty, to the point that I had to finish all the rice in the bowl to balance out the saltiness.   I do not recommend this place, unless someone wants cheap and low quality sushi."}
{"text":"Could've been 4-star but cash only. They do not use the proper noodle for Japanese ramen but you cut them a little slack because this is Pittsburgh. Then the soup isn't that amazing either. I'll give them another try and order something other than ramen though."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open for months. My mom and I are big fans of Everyday Noodles and we were super excited when we found out that the owners were opening up a Japanese style restaurant in Shadyside.   Upon entering, you will notice some high top tables to your left and the bar before walking to the dining room in the back of the restaurant. I would like to note that it is on the smaller side, but it's a very beautiful restaurant. They have sake bottles within the wall that are beautifully showcased.   We both ordered Shrimp and bacon Yakitori and Lamb Yakitori. It was so delicious that we decided to order seconds. The lamb was so flavorful and juicy, I highly recommend getting this if you come here. My mom was a huge fan of the bacon and shrimp. The bacon has a nice smokey taste to it, yum!! You get about 3 pieces on the skewer.   My mom ordered the shrimp tempura donburi and I ordered the chicken donburi. The bowls are extremely filling (there's so much rice at the bottom of the bowl)! The chicken has mushroom, onion, cabbage and an egg sauce drizzled on top! The shrimp tempura had eggplant and other veggies that mom mom added instead of the peppers. We got miso soup on the side which came with our dinners.   The service was very accommodating and friendly:) I love this little addition in Shadyside and will be sure to return with my friends!"}
{"text":"Yes!  Yum!  Go here!  First I loved their sake options and recommend the panda sake.  Our waitress was super friendly and helpful.   We had the bacon wrapped quail egg & it was delicious.  The octopus salad was very creamy and good.  We had the volcano, scallop, and spicy tuna rolls & loved them all.  This was some of the best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh and I really suggest you try this place"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went for lunch here on a weekday and it was pretty empty. I ordered a bowl of miso ramen and it was pretty decent. Maybe not the best I've ever had but definitely above the average in Pittsburgh. My favorite part was the texture of the half cooked egg in the ramen. We asked for some chili sauce too (not sriracha but the one with chopped peppers in it), which brought out more flavors in the ramen. I was also happy with the spicy tuna sushi we ordered here. Last but not least, I was very satisfied with the service here. Also my boyfriend accidentally left his card behind when we left and the waiter literally ran a block to catch us. Will definitely come back to this place at some point."}
{"text":"Best quality Japanese food in Pittsburgh! The prices are great given the quality and quantity. I got the grilled eel bowl which tasted authentic, was quite filling, and came with miso soup for just $12. It is cash only but there is an ATM inside. I will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"There is a lack of both authentic izakaya as well as ramen joints in Pittsburgh, and Tan Izakaya attempts to remedy both. It seems that they're doing a surprisingly decent job despite splitting their efforts into two, although I feel that if they concentrated on either one of the two they'd do a better job. Their uniqueness is further diminished by the fact that they also serve sushi, an item that doesn't really fit in with the whole bar/pub draw of an izakaya. They do have some nice apps and grilled skewers that may be hard to find elsewhere, like quail egg or chicken gizzard.  In any case, we came here to try the ramen. At $12-14, they're hitting the borderline of fancy NYC ramen prices, although the quality is not quite there yet. That said, the taste and composition are definitely better than any other ramen I've had in Pittsburgh (and this is after I said that Love Yogurt had the best customizable ramen, though maybe about 25% cheaper). The broth was savory and just a bit spicy, the pork belly was tender, the fried tofu was a sweet addition, and the egg was bordering between solid and runny. As far as I could tell, we got legit ramen noodles and weren't forced to choose between udon and soba. The noodles were just a tad soft, but otherwise it was all pretty good. A fair comparison to make would probably be with G&G Noodle Bar in downtown, and after I get a chance to try that I'll probably write an update."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and good food in general. Can't compare to LA ones but definitely good enough."}
{"text":"A favorite in Pittsburgh.  Truly lovely waitstaff and food is consistently delicious. The sashimi plate is great, teppanyaki are well-prepared, and ramen options are good (but not great). Love the atmosphere and decor. Very glad they're no longer cash only...."}
{"text":"Great japanese in the neighborhood. Service is great and sashimi is of high quality. The beer is cold (restaurants, this is how it os served) plus the decor is high end asian style. The price is right on the edge maybe a bit pricey but is worth combining quality, decor and service!"}
{"text":"I am so excited that I searched on Yelp for a Sunday night sushi restaurant with a full bar. Located right in Shadyside, with ample parking for Sunday evening. I'm sure parking isn't that easy during the day or on a busy Friday and Saturday night.   The restaurant was super creative with their Sushi presentation. The ingredients were really fresh and the wasabi was actually good. Not fresh but decent. They had great Yakitori and my favorite was the bacon-wrapped quail egg.  They had a great assortment of Sakes available and a creative cocktail list.  It's a very small restaurant so try and go when it's not super busy and maybe even call ahead. We ended up sitting at the bar which was perfect because the bartender was awesome and very friendly and helpful with the menu."}
{"text":"Today was my first time here and let me just say, EVERYTHING We ordered was delicious!! The hot and sour soup--- delicious!! My first time trying Kimchee----- delicious!! Order the Red Dragon Roll for sure!"}
{"text":"finally tried their sashimi with rice ($24?). It has more pieces than the other one ($15). Really, the price/piece were the same, it just depends on how many u can eat.    The menu changed a bit, the price was $1+ from last time i visited. The numbering system was also gone.  But the same dishes are still here (my #80 and #81 from previous review).  There is a beef starter on iron plate that looked really good, should try that next time.  Another welcoming change is that the sashimi donburi now has an upgrade option. you can add uni / scallops / ikura for +$7. see photo."}
{"text":"I've definitely had better ramen in Pittsburgh for much less. I was surprised to see that the options for ramen noodles were either Udon or Soba. I don't believe that either of those options are meant for ramen honestly. I got Soba because it felt weird to get Udon since I specifically ordered Ramen...?   I thought it was really weird that none of the people who greeted me in Japanese were even asian. There was only one asian waitress there. Seemed like management was totally run by American people. I think I also saw Chinese on the menu even though it was supposed to be a Japanese restaurant. Lastly, it made me a little uncomfortable that there was no sushi bar at the front and the sushi platters were simply brought out from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Now that this place has changed names and owners from Tan Izakaya, the food is much better.  At the moment, Fujiya is probably the best ramen in Pittsburgh.  In addition to the typical tonkotsu you'll find at most good ramen places in the US, they also have a seafood ramen in a light broth with clams and shrimp that is pretty fantastic.  The noodles are chewy and the broth is fragrant."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to coming here for a while. And I will preface this by saying my standards for Japanese izakaya style experiences are probably unreasonably high. But since when has that stopped anyone from spouting off?!  I'll just get the negatives out of the way first:  1) Very poor service, had zero training, not his fault, but very poor. He took down the wrong sushi order (scallop vs live scallop, for example), forgot an app, and didn't know the answer to any menu questions. Although he was honest and said he hadn't even seen the dishes. So I blame management and the training, sorry, not sorry.   2) False advertising on the menus! The chuhai (shochu, soda and juice) were claiming to be fresh pressed juices. We got grapefruit and it tasted decidedly unfresh pressed. When I asked they admitted that only their lemon is fresh pressed. But that one had a bunch of sugar in it, so I don't know. That was very uncool. Don't lie on the menu. Just. Don't.   3) Some dishes were pretty poorly thought out, terribly executed and just not good, at all (pork belly). Others were just poorly executed (ramen, certain yakitori). Let me focus on the pork belly. Imagine a steamed limp tasteless set of pork belly slices interlaced with partially dried out limp slices of cucumber draped over a chopstick teepee. It was bizarre and terrible. Wow, worst dish of the year for sure.   I will move on to the high points. There were two of them:  1) The bacon wrapped quail egg was executed perfectly. In fact it was the best version of that I've had and I get it anytime I see it. The quail eggs were perfectly soft and creamy inside. Not runny, not even close to overcooked. Perfect.   The other yakitori were lack luster but the presentation was novel and semi-functional in that it had a burning piece of sterno(?) in the middle. This kept them warm while eating!  2) The live scallop was excellent. We also had the scallop nigiri (which they brought out accidentally but made us pay for anyway). The live scallop was decidedly fresher and better tasting. But I have to admit, after the chuhai lie, I wasn't even sure if the scallop was live at all!  Anyway, I'm sad this turned out to be so disappointing but unless this starts getting rave reviews, I won't be back. Unless I absolutely have to have some quail egg yakitori!"}
{"text":"I only had the salmon futomaki and some yakitori, which were pretty good for a Japanese restaurant in the U.S.  Our waiter was a bit strange and I could only understand half the things he said.  He kept making unsolicited recommendations even though we already ordered.  I liked the food and atmosphere, although a tiny bit loud.  I want to try the Ramen next time."}
{"text":"If I could, I would have given this place a 0/5 rating. My waitress was absolutely incompetent. I have dined here a handful of times before, but this experience was horrible enough to convince me to never go back again. Our dining party had 7 people, each with separate orders, yet our waitress brought each appetizer out on the same plate. Our waitress then lied to us about the types of noodles we were getting in our ramen, and blamed our incorrect food orders on the kitchen staff (we ordered Soba noodles and got udon noodles). When we asked for our checks, she brought out one check despite requesting separate checks. We tried to make it easy by sectioning off the check and writing our credit card numbers and cash amounts next to each order, yet she still charged over half of our orders to the wrong cards, and the orders that were charged contained the incorrect individual items. She failed to bring change back for anyone who paid with cash, and then gave us attitude when we asked for change. We spoke to a manager, who tried to lie to us and tell us that it was written on the menu that parties over 6 people would not have split checks. We checked the menu, and the only fine print said that parties with over 6 people would have 18% gratuity included on their checks. Wrong food, horrible service, managers with sour attitudes ... this place is sub par at best."}
{"text":"My trip here with some friends was very spontaneous so I didn't expect much going in. I think the place is more 3.5 than 4 but based on food I'd do a 4 (I'm not very well versed on this style  food). I got ramen and my friends got 2 sushi rolls and we all kinda tried everything. We also had some edamame and yakitori. The yakitori is small but it's cool that it's $2 and you can try a bunch.    Now for the fact that they have an open garage door window and it was Shadyside on a Saturday I was slightly surprised they weren't busier. I have no complaints about the food and I really enjoyed he freshness of the rolls. We had the Crazy Tuna roll and the Taipei roll.   Here's my issue. We sat at a high top table near the front window and when I sat down I knew there wasn't enough space on the table. I figured maybe if everything came out when it was supposed to it would be fine. But everything came out within 3 minutes of each other. The yakitori came out with the edamame, and then just as we had situated all the plates and soy cups, all of the sushi and ramen came out. At this point we should have asked to move but we were too committed at this point. Plates everywhere and we just kept trying to make everything fit. But we persevered. I feel like our waitress came over way too many times also. I get being attentive and that's great, but it was a bit overboard. She was very very nice though.   Anywho, I would absolutely go back and try it again. I enjoyed the food and that's most important. Oh and did I mention wine is $5 a glass?! :)"}
{"text":"This place is NOT good at all. The sushi is expensive and tastless. Not worth your time or money really !!!"}
{"text":"Tan Izakaya has the presentation that makes you feel welcome and excited to eat Japanese food. All the employees are dressed up in Japanese gear, and the wooden decor gives you the vibes that you're in for a treat.  The menu here is superb. They have sushi, yakitori and ramen. For the sushi, I was really impressed by the presentation. They like to put small things like palm trees and flowers on their dishes, which makes the already well-decorated sushi look even more appetizing. However, I do have to admit that despite the nice presentation, the salmon I was served wasn't that great. The meat looked darker than it should be, and tasted mushy like it was old or had been sitting out too long. The avocado was also dark, which indicates that it probably had been sitting out for a while. As for the eel sashimi I got, I was really impressed. It was sauced perfectly, and the meat was really tender. Thumbs up for that.  I ordered two yakitori---lamb and chicken wings. I enjoyed both, and was really surprised when they brought up a plate with a flaming torch on the side. I'm telling you, the presentation here is really amazing. Finally, the ramen I had was really good. The soup was top notch, and there were not any unnecessary condiments or vegetables in the bowl, so you could eat everything. To finish off my great meal, I ordered an ice cream mochi. Wow, was I impressed by that. The chewy mochi mixed perfectly with the soft, tasty green tea ice cream inside.   Tan Izakaya really impressed me with their incredible performance of maintaining a colorful and appetizing image for all their food that really got me into the mood to love and want to eat the food. Although my salmon roll wasn't as fresh as I would've liked, everything else came beautifully and really had me leaving happy. Good job."}
{"text":"Got the sashimi teishoku, was great! Fresh fish, perfect temperature, and generous serving. I also got the quail eggs wrapped in bacon and chicken gizzards and heart, needle mushrooms, and hot and sour soup. Quail eggs were like small breakfast sandwiches, and hot and sour soup had spicy bite with a hearty consistency. Got Hot sake and miyozakura sake, which complimented food well. Had a TV to watch world series. This was a good experience."}
{"text":"I ordered a ramen bowl. First off, the broth was just warm and not at serving temperature for ramen condition. Secondly, the ramen was over cooked, which made the noodle a bit starchy and lost the sensation of chewing texture (should feel a bit elastic). The Kakuni was lean, but flavor was adaquate. Ajitamago was cooked perfectly and flavored well. We also ordered yakitori beef and lamb were a bit over cooked, not particularly excited with the taste as well. The atmosphere was cozy and relaxing. The glass for the beer was not iced for serving. Overall, I gave 2 stars..."}
{"text":"Idk if I got a bad batch of mochi or what, but that was NOT good Green Tea Mochi. The mochi dough was tough and leathery. Like, MAYBE it just had a bad case of freezer burn, but it was definitely not good. I sent it back it was so unappetizing. (And before you judge, I've had far more mochi than just Trader Joe's - and fresh made mochi ice cream at that).  However, the service here was wonderful. When we sent back the mochi, the manager came over to ask about what they could improve and also took it and our drinks off of the check.   I gotta admit that I was hoping that this would be a 4 star review, but overall, it was just good - not great.   Decor is great and there are plenty of options, but just go expecting that it won't be the most authentic experience, but it will be enjoyable.  Do note if you want the ramen to order with the soba noodles. I LOVE udon, but that's not ramen."}
{"text":"This review comes with the caveat that we will almost certainly be back, despite the low rating. The other caveat is that we just got back from Japan, so our standards may have been a little too high, but my quibble is not with the food!  We came here on a Wednesday night around 7pm, during the first week of opening. The 7pm timing was fortunate as we were the last group that did not have to wait for a table. We were seated at a high-top across near the TV and bar. Our server came over and dropped off menus, then returned maybe a minute later to ask if we were ready. We asked for water and a few more minutes (the menu is pretty extensive).  More than ten minutes later, still no server. We flag down another table's server and ask him to send her out--we're pretty hungry by this time. She shows up a few minutes later and we order some ramen, some yakitori, and a maki roll.  Another twenty minutes pass. Our server stops by and comments with surprise that we don't have our food yet, and tells us she'll rush it. The ramen and maki come out together, which was a little frustrating as we like to share and both should be eaten pretty much immediately upon receipt. A minute later the yakitori come out in a pretty cool presentation--there are flaming sugar cubes alongside the skewers.   We dig into the maki (Alaska Fresh Roll)--quite good by Pittsburgh standards (obviously it didn't match the freshness of Japan)--and the Santouka ramen. The ramen came with two choices of noodles...neither of which were ramen noodles! Odd. We opted for udon over soba, and the perfectly cooked egg and pretty gluten \"chip\" were certainly reminiscent of ramen, but the broth lacked the depth of the ramen we had had in Japan (also lacked much spice, despite supposedly having chili oil in there). Still, it beats the pants off of Umami's over-salted bowl (but not as good as Ramen Bar).   Another server/hostess comes by and tells us there is a large party coming in by the window, so could we please move to different chairs at our table to accommodate them. As weird as it was to have a TV in an izakaya, I was enjoying watching the tennis match, so this was pretty annoying. Now our chairs back right up to the bar chairs, and we repeatedly are bumped by other patrons (and servers trying to squeeze by).  We start on the yakitori, and notice that one skewer is of mushroom, which we hadn't ordered, and we're missing the chicken and green onion skewer that we had. I flag down our server, and she takes the mushroom skewer away. She comes back to apologize, tells us the new skewer will be right out, and offers to comp us some salads/soup/drinks. We had ordered the amount of food we wanted, so we decline. The chicken skewer comes eventually and it is AWESOME. We had a bunch of these in Japan and this totally rivals them. The shishito pepper skewer was also brilliantly seasoned, and the bacon quail egg was good (albeit hard to screw up). This place does yakitori well, as any izakaya should!  We ask for the check, and we were charged for every item. I know we declined the comped salads/drinks, but it seemed odd to offer to comp a $5 drink and not comp one measly $2 skewer. The food was excellent, but we were not treated well as patrons and this was extremely frustrating...we left the restaurant feeling very glum. It appears Tan does takeout, so if the next visit isn't a vast improvement, I'll stick to feeding my cravings that way. Bottom line: definitely get the yakitori, but don't expect to be valued. The \"meh\" tagline on the 2-star rating sums it up pretty well...food was outstanding, but the experience was downright draining."}
{"text":"I've passed Tan Izakaya a few times without stopping by just because I never had the chance. I regret not doing so before because Tan Iz provides a pretty unique experience. Firstly, the drink menu is riddled with Japanese beers ON TAP. It's not every day you can get Sapporo on tap, not to mention they have a nice variety. The drinks don't stop there, they even have Sake flights for any of you rice-wine aficionados who didn't know a Sake flight was a thing.   So let's say you want a few drinks and a few nibblers. Yakitori is Japanese for delicious little nibblers. Quail egg wrapped in bacon, shrimp and bacon, lamb, mushroom, whatever- on a stick for $2 each; Quaint and delightful. That's just an appe-teaser. The sushi is , quite simply put, great. It is acceptable pricing for the quality and it is presented beautifully for those who hold aesthetics in high regard.   My buddy got the Ramen and again the aroma and aesthetics taste as good as presented.   In addition to the bang-up job they did with the food,  the service was overflowing with enthusiasm and were insanely helpful answering all my questions. I have a blood disorder that doesn't allow for much (if any) soy intake...So why the hell would I go to a JAPANESE restaurant?!?! Well because I love sushi and all food. This staff and chef were greatly accommodating to make sure I had no soy, without sacrificing the integrity of taste and presentation. Not to mention the Chef has his own homemade soy sauce for you to try(heartbreaking that I couldn't, trust me).   I really think this place is getting lower ratings because these people are finding it expensive...It's in Shadyside...off of Walnut St... I mean, there's a Williams and Sonoma around the corner, the price hike is expected. Expensive location + Specialized Food = $$$  The drinks are pretty cheap anyway. This place is great if you are fine with spending a wee bit more.   I'll be back...to binge drink, most likely."}
{"text":"Our first experience with ramen bowls! It is pretty small so they require reservations for parties of 6 or more. We went at about 7:30 on a Sunday, it was still rather busy but our party of 3 was sat with no wait. The atmosphere and decor were great and we liked looking around. Although we did not make it for happy hour, they do offer some decent drink specials. Our group had the Tan Boa app, the steamed buns were absolutely perfect and the pork, so tasty! For entrees we had 2 different ramen bowls and sushi and were more than satisfied."}
{"text":"It's been one of my favorite places since it opened. The only drawback is cash only. Well their homemade wasabi is also not good, the regular wasabi comes with the sushi is better"}
{"text":"Nice and inexpensive Japanese restaurant. I tried the Pork Cordon Bleu Donburi. It tastes good, but not quite authentic. They also have delivery services. I used to order their Grilled Eel Teishoku a lot."}
{"text":"Best sushi and miso soup I've had so far around here! Nice atmosphere and friendly attentive service. Beautiful presentation as well. Will definitely be back and send my friends here."}
{"text":"Last friday I ordered the Tan Miso Ramen and a spicy tuna roll for delivery.   The Good:   1 order of ramen with a sushi appetizer was enough to feed 2 people a satisfying meal. Also, the delivery was VERY fast, especially for a friday night around the dinner rush. That being said, my apartment is less than a 5 minute drive from the restaurant. The sushi roll was pretty good and so was the tofu in the ramen.  The Bad:  We were very disappointed with the amount of pork belly in our meal. Each of us got literally 1 bite. It was a good bite! Just not enough. I wasn't expecting a ton, but I would rather not pay $13 dollars for two bites of pork belly. The miso was also under seasoned and we had to add salt.  Overall not bad, but I doubt we'll be ordering again with another ramen place opening in Lawrenceville soon."}
{"text":"I was actually slightly more impressed than I should have been. The room was nice and open and they have a garage door in the front so we got some sun and a bit of weather.bit was really nice to feel the breeze. They have high top tables as well as bar and regular seating. We got there and the server was very welcoming and warm. He offered good suggestions and was around when we needed but was not hoovering. I appreciated that.  Appetizers: Quail Egg and Bacon: These were great. They came with three wrapped eggs and were done really well. I dipped them in a bit of their homemade soy sauce. YUM. I wish there were four on the stick so we didn't have to pick who got the last one. But it was a really great appy.  King Oyster Mushroom: Not as good as the quail eggs but still ok. I won't say that I would get it again, but it was pretty good. These come with more pieces so we both got to try more of them. I liked the smoky flavor and dipping in the soy sauce really made them even better. A good vegetarian option for an appy.  Main Dish: Beef Ramen: Spicy mustard greens, basil, onions, bean sprouts,miso broth, jalapenos. This is spicier than I thought it would be. I ended up having to blow my nose because it got things moving! I loved the broth and entire bowl was a really good mixture of flavor. I would get this again. The bowl had two different types if beef and was just good.  Santouka Ramen: Yes. I would get this again. This bowl had seaweed, tofu skin, coddled eggs, fish cake, corn, green onions, pork belly, minced pork hot sauce, and miso. Really you cannot go wrong with this dish. Also a bit hotter than expected. Cleaned out my post nasal drip! The only thing is that the corn was a bit weird for me. I didn't know how to feel about it. But overall it mixed well and was a great dish.  I had a great time here. I would come back for the service, atmosphere and the amazing food!"}
{"text":"First off, the service was very good.  We were not in a hurry and the server understood and came by every once in a while to check on us with very good timing.  We split a few items.  Started with the Hot & Sour soup that was very good.  Had a Spicy tuna roll that was just OK and a California roll that was good.  The Tempura Donburi was very good, but only one large shrimp.  One of our group had the Sashimi Donburi and was very happy.  Others had some other sushi and were very pleased.  All in all we had a good meal and a good time.  CASH ONLY!  Be prepared!!!!"}
{"text":"I've walked past Tan Izakaya many times before finally stepping in to have a meal a couple months ago. This place can get pretty crowded during peak dinner hours.   My boyfriend and I shared the seafood ramen, spicy tuna roll, Taipei roll, and pure Alaska roll. The seafood ramen had a lot of flavor and portion was large enough. I was a fan of all three of the rolls and liked that they didn't have too much rice like some rolls do. The food turned out to be better than we thought and my boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised. We are very likely to return.  Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 4 Service | 3.5 OVERALL | 4"}
{"text":"Pricy compared to the quality of their food. I came to here once and won't consider coming back"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: reviews of the place somehow carried over from Tan Izakaya so the reviews aren't accurate.  Fujiya has real tonkotsu ramen and the place is easily better than its competitors of Pittsburgh. The place is also much better than the previous Tan Izakaya. It's not as godlike like the stuff in NYC or LA but it's still hits the baseline \"this is good ramen worth the money\" which is a first in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I can't decide between four and five stars, so whatever. The basil chicken is awesome, and I had an LA ramen with that. The ramen was pretty great, though the soup base was just a little too salty for my taste. If you don't plan on drinking all the soup though, the ramen is great. :)"}
{"text":"Finally another ramen/sushi establishment in Pittsburgh/Shadyside!  For Pittsburgh, this place is great, but be warned, they serve udon or soba noodles with your ramen - not traditional alkaline noodles you find out in California/Japan. To be fair, I don't think there are any legit ramen restaurants in Pittsburgh.    We walked in and were greeted and seated right away. The restaurant was pretty empty since we came before the lunch rush. Super nice decor and they also have a full bar. Nice!    Food: We ordered an Eel Donburi  and the Shoyu Ramen. Both were flavorful, hearty, and delicious.  We also ordered a Spider Roll, which was like any other we've had before. My boyfriend loved the eel and said the donburi bowl is a good size.  For dessert, we  ordered the green tea mochi and some coconut gelatin dessert. The mochi was okay, but the coconut gelatin was awesome! Super refreshing and light. We paid about $40 and tip, which is average for Shadyside. They have other dishes on the menu, such as yakitori, sashimi, sushi rolls, etc. We'll definitely be back to try more.  Service: five stars. Attentive servers - our water cups were always full and they regularly checked on us. The owner even came by to say hi and asked how the food taste.   In a food wasteland like Pittsburgh, this establishment is a nice and necessary addition. Check it out."}
{"text":"Tan Izakaya has changed to being cash only! A bummer IMO"}
{"text":"We have continued to enjoy Tan. They have added a lot of new items to their menu. Among some of my new favorites are the Brussel sprouts, both the hot and sour and miso soups, the Napoleon roll, the Lobster roll, the ramen, and the seared ahi tuna appetizer. Everything tastes so fresh. Also happy to say that they now take credit cards again. I know a lot of people were not happy when it was cash only so the owners listened and changed the policy.  Even if you do not care for sushi, there are so many new options on the menu that you might enjoy  including vegetarian and chicken and beef dishes."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to have Japanese food, but as a Japanese food lover, I would say the food is not what I expected, but it's a little bit more than average. One thing I don't like about this restaurant is that it only accepts cash."}
{"text":"After hearing great things about this place from my friend, I stopped here for a quick lunch today. We were seated immediately by the window, which was opened up to the street so we could enjoy the nice weather. We ordered a few yakitori to start: shrimp and bacon, beef and asparagus, and king oyster mushroom. I liked the beef and asparagus a lot, but thought the mushroom and shrimp and bacon ones were missing some flavor.   We also ordered the sashimi platter and santuoka ramen to share. Their presentation was beautiful, particularly for the sashimi platter. The salmon was very fresh, but I felt like the yellowtail tasted like it had just been frozen. Not sure if it was worth the price for the amount of fish we got (considering the quality of some was lacking). I enjoyed the santuoka ramen and would definitely come back for that. The noodles had a nice texture and the broth was well seasoned and had a little bit of spice to it. The portion was also pretty large for a good price.   While I'm not in a huge rush to come back for their sushi - I think there are better options around Pittsburgh - I would definitely stop in to try their other hot dishes!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to satisfy your craving for ramen or sushi (I liked the fuji yama rolls quite a bit). The pork donburi is also pretty good. And the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"What a great experience we had! I have been so anxious to try this place since they put up the sign, and I can finally said I did. Me and my boyfriend came here on a Friday night around 7 and it was pretty busy. However, we were greeted right away we didn't have to wait :-) I sometime get grumpy if I do.  I ordered three yakitori: quail egg and bacon, King oyster mushrooms, and beef and asparagus. It was cool how they presented these. The yakitori were all poked into a cucumber and the plate have sugar and alcohol around it. They lit the alcohol and sugar so there's this cool flame for a little while. All of them are so tasty, price is very reasonable as well. For entree, I got chicken rice omelet and my boyfriend got the seafood deluxe bowl. They both have are so yummy! I would definitely recommend them. Both entree came with miso soup. Miso soup was also very good! I wanted to try the ramen but didn't get a chance, I will come back for ramen next time. The food didn't take long at all, we were in and out of the restaurant in no time. It was overall a great experience. The chefs and many waitress seem to be Taiwanese, which I am Taiwanese myself, so I can see myself coming here a lot now :-) this place is a great addition to Shadyside!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's wrong with the uni they served. It just tastes bitter and awful. I have tried their uni for about 4 times and every time it was the same terrible taste. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My friend and I found this newly opened restaurant, looked at the menu and decided to check it out. The place isn't big but the ambiance is nice.   I have been craving takitori for the longest time and I wasn't disappointed. I ordered the lamb and the king oyster mushroom. The lamb takitori was amazing, mushroom less so. My friend ordered the chicken with green onion and the Pork with green onion. And she was happy with both.  My friend got the fried pork donburi. It was really good. The portion was very generous that she decided to save half of it for lunch the next day. I've got the roasted eel with rice. It was also very well done. The eel comes with a salad, miso soup, and chawanmushi. The chawanmushi is surprisingly good even though it looked modest at first glance. The eel is fresh, not too dry and not with too much sauce. I liked it a lot.  It was pouring rain but they were really nice and let us stayed to wait for the rain to stop. We ordered a green tea mochi ice cream for desert. That was also good, better than the ones from Trader Joe's.   In general it was good food and good service. It's a nice addition to pittsburgh's new food scene."}
