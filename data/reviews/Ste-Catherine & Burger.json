{"text":"Oh what a perfect ending to my weekend in Montreal. Came to this place with a group, all of us had a different burger and all of us thoroughly enjoyed it. Wish I could remember the one I had, but they were all good.   Only downside was that this put us in a food coma and we couldn't continue on."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating at Ste-Catherine & Burger Saturday evening after Heavy Montreal.  Had a delicious grilled cheese sandwich with a side salad that was excellent!  So was the ice cold Heinkens.  Great menu and excellent service.  Sarah is absolutely lovely and an excellent server.  I look forward to my next visit to Ste-Catherine & Burger when I visit Montreal the next time."}
{"text":"We seated ourselves at the bar because the place was packed. Once we were FINALLY acknowledged by the only waitress in the whole place, we gave her our entire order for fear she'd never be back. After waiting ten more minutes for a diet because apparently cocktails are only available when they're not busy?? and a beer on tap, our food took another 45 minutes. The poutine we ordered for an app came out with our entrees , defeating the purpose of an appetizer. The food was mediocre and it seemed ridiculous that a burger, which can't even be cooked to order, would cost $15-$20. Our waitress was apologetic once she realized my dissatisfaction and paid for our drinks, however you should never go here expecting anything but terrible service and overpriced , well done burgers."}
{"text":"Ordered the mac and cheese poutine, and was very dissapointed.  Just mac n cheese on french fries, no cheese curds or gravy? When I told the waitress she took it to the kitchen and put gravy n cheese on it and it was pretty damn good.  Cheers to this lil joint for making their customers happy and being super friendly even though I was kinda a dick lol I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Just visiting Montreal and happened to stop here for lunch  The French fries were great and they take their burgers seriously however the highlight was the poutine  The poutine was great and we are not sure about the gravy but they add something that makes it go from good to great. Well worth checking out"}
{"text":"i kind of love this place, tho it locates at the central of downtown where many thieves.  I watched UFC, they played wonderful music. girls in this place are helpful with natural smiles. I feel the harmonious atmosphere. you can sit outside also. everything goes well. of course they have great burgers."}
{"text":"The service was really bad; slow and inattentive. They messed one out of five orders up, a second one was a cold Poutine (who would ever want to eat a cold Poutine straight of the kitchen...). My burger was slightly above room temp... the meat was delicious though. Just wish I didn't have to wait for 5 waitresses to walk by before I could get ones attention to bring us more water. Asked for ketchup twice and never got any till the people sitting next to us finally just shared theirs!"}
{"text":"I retract a previous statement that I made a few months ago about the avocado chuck burger I ate at the Hard Rock Cafe on Hollywood Boulevard. The mac & cheese burger at this little gem is my new all time davourite. The waiter was awesome. And the place has graffiti covered walls throughout. I had a nice pint of some local French beer that I can't pronounce and it was d-lish. 5 star brews, 5 star burgers, 5 star staff"}
{"text":"My girlfriend & I went to this spot for a quick lunch on our visit to Montréal. Upon entry we were instantly greeted and to choose any seat of our choosing. Very friendly staff and menus are available in both French & English. After ordering, our food came in very fast time. The mac & cheese burger I ordered was delicious, and the chicken burger my girlfriend ordered was amazing too. I also had a very delicious and generous serving of poutine as a side for only a few extra dollars. I would totally recommend anyone who loves burgers or hot dogs to check out this spot."}
{"text":"I downloaded the app just for this resto. I know, only mad people right reviews. So let's start off with my buddy getting a chicken burger instead of chicken Wings...ok no big deal, miscommunication. Then I get a hair wrapped around a fry, I send it back. She changes the fries. My girlfriend gets a hair in her fry. No apology. Ok, lacks a little soft skills. Left us sitting there with empty plates for 30 minutes, never checked in. When the bills came, I asked if they were changing full price because of the hairs in our plate. She replied \"it happens\".  Mediocre over priced burger, with God awful service. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Restaurant correct et prix très raisonnables. Service impeccable et savoureux burgers. L'endroit n'était pas achalandé un samedi soir. Important à savoir parce que ce genre d'endroit peut être facilement bondé de clients."}
