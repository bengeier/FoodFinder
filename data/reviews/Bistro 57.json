{"text":"The food is flavored very good. They have an all you can eat marinara or alfredo pasta for $10. Calamari was tender and there was a lot on the plate. Prices rival Olive Garden. The atmosphere was upscale and clean. The music was at a nice level, not too loud. All of the staff was very professional and attentative. Not much bad to say about Bistro 57 besides its location and the fact that Aliante Casino has the tightest machines outside of the strip which keeps the casino kinda empty. In Summerlin, this place would be packed on the weekend. The place looks too fancy for the area and I figure most people walk past it heading to the buffet, Friday's, or the food court."}
{"text":"Sometimes you take a chance on a dish and it turns out to be one of the better meals you've had in a while. Was craving carbonara and it's not on the menu but the chef was nice enough to make it for me. They did not skimp on the pancetta and this dish has a little kick to it..This dish satisfied my cravings.. It's a must try.."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place.  A beautiful, tasteful place we were actually proud to bring family and friends too.  Imagine not having to leave North Las Vegas to find something classy.  It felt like we had a secret because it was so good and so uncrowded at the same time.  And the food was really good!  But we went last week and no more Bruschetta (best I've ever had, drool worthy), no more roasted beet salad, no more fish and chips for my sons, just no more can we go there now, even though it's a beautiful venue.  Change is inevitable, I guess. So sad. Guess we'll have to move from NLV."}
{"text":"I am going to give it 5 stars because its come so far from what it was when Station owned it the wine selection is very good but the food is better.  Its so good its a destination by itself.  The chef seems to be around most of the time and watches everything. The ingredients are first class but the prices are low Worth the trip to North Las Vegas"}
{"text":"With respect to Mary P., our experience with this place was quite the opposite.  We went on a Friday night with a craving for Fish and Chips.  The table was clean, good location, no cigarette smell, but we sat, and waited...and waited...and waited.  It was not crowded by any means, busy perhaps, but not crowded.  Finally, our waiter arrived, took our drink order, then we waited...and waited...and, you guessed it, waited.   My martini came a bit warm, and my wife's cosmo tasted as if it had little liquor in it.  I had specified Stoly, and could not be sure it was.  Our waiter was accompanied by a floor manager who asked how everything was...couldn't tell him musch because we had nothing as yet.  When our Fish and Chips finally arrived (shortly after our appetizer-can't recommend the calamari either), I ordered another and asked the waiter to make certain the bartender used Stoly.  A bit of a shorter wait later, our drinks came and lo and behold, the martini was crisp and cold, and the Cosmo tasted like a cocktail.  Draw your own conclusions.  The chips in the Fish and Chips are very thin, and somewhat tasteless.  They quickly become cold and inedible.  The fish was ok, not too much breading, but again, lacking flavor.   The Alliante is clost to our home, but from now on, we'll stick with The Market."}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was better than average for money! Large portions!!!  Will go back again!!!"}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday and did not not it was Half price Pasta until 8 pm and a word of warning if you order anything other than pasta be prepared to wait We order soup which as wonderful but  it took one hour for our order of fish and chips to arrive  We went back the following day and order a pizza and Shepard pie. The Shepard pie as good but the pizza was super salty  We notified the waitress and called the chef to our table. They offered to re make the pizza.  Since were in a rush we declined. They took the pizza off the bill and gave us a card for a free on another day  Will give it one more chance and see what happens, fingers crossed"}
{"text":"This place is great! We have been here numerous times and never had a bad meal. The prices are also very reasonable. My only complaint is that I wish they had a more exciting dessert menu. But don't let that deter you elsewhere.  I recommend trying the bruschetta, the French onion soup and the goat cheese appetizer. Be advised the goat cheese app is quite large!  The eggplant meal is enough for three servings and comes with pasta. Delish!  Service here is always top notch as well as the decor inviting. We will continue to return again and again.  Don't miss out on this North Las Vegas gem!"}
{"text":"After a movie at the Aliante, we ate at Bistro 57.  We got lucky and got there right at 4pm when half price pizza and pasta start  until 6 pm (Weds and Thurs only).  However, we chose lasagne which wasn't on the half price list.  It was good enough and I have no complaint about service.  Was disappointed that no bread or dinner salad was served before the main course.  We had a plate of lasagne and that's all.  Maybe I'm just used to going to 'cheaper' restaurants where the bread and dinner salad just come with the meal.  It's worth a try and I may even go back for on a Weds or Thurs for half price pizza or pasta (which looked mostly like spaghetti)."}
{"text":"Ok let me say the 3 stars are only because the food is delicious and the chef was so kind.I ordered the antipasto which was very good . For my entree the lasagna which is where the problem began. The lasagna looked as if it was sitting in the window for a while probably while I ate my salad. I bit into it and it was cold in the center. My server took it back and exactly 13 minutes later she brought out a piece that was so hot the sauce was bubbling. It was the same piece I had bit into which is fine because I hate to waste food . The taste was great. As I was eating the chef personally came out and apologized which I thought was a nice touch. Especially since the guy in the suit who should have came over to apologize did absolutely nothing! He never even visited the table. As I concluded the meal the server brought out a slice of some delicious cheesecake which was so good I couldn't believe it was house made. This was the chefs way of apologizing to me for the lasagna . Honestly him coming to the table and owning it was enough but who's going to turn down free cheesecake! I would recommend this place if you wanted good tasting food but it's lacking in service. Maybe the chef could teach the young lady who waited on me and the manager a thing or two about how to treat paying customers!"}
{"text":"The first time my husband and I went he had the shepherd's pie and it was AMAZING. We went back tonight and ordered the shepherd's pie again and was very disappointed. It was still tasty but not as good as the first time we had it. The service was great."}
{"text":"Go here quite often, always great food and service. Price is usually right on target too. Like the HH and the live music !!"}
{"text":"Located inside the heart of Aliante Casino Resort. Don't worry about it being inside a casino, as once you're inside the restaurant it has the feel and looks of a top-notch restaurant.  Our server was a nice guy, Randy, who was knowledgeable on the menu. Him and the help were accessible. No issues at all with the service. For appetizer, we order the baked goat cheese. Oh my, glutinous. It was so delicious on top of a toasted slice of french bread and drizzled with marinara sauce. For dinner, I ordered the mushroom pasta with filet mignon. Great portion, great taste. It was a generous portion that I had to take half home for lunch the following day.   This was a nice place. If we're back at Aliante, I'm sure this is a place I'd frequent again."}
{"text":"bistro 57 provides EXCELLENT SERVICE, decent food but a poor Happy Hour.  The drinks are slightly reduced bit their new bar food pricing is all wrong. They advertise $5 appetizers bit provide less than half the normal portion.  In other words,  an $8 meatball appetizer which for$8 has two meatballs and fries,  for$5 it is ONE MEATBALL and fries!  All the menu appetizers are more expensive at happy hour,  based on portion,  than regular price.   We really like the place but figured we won't be eating there during happy hour until they make it HAPPY AGAIN.  BTW this all happened due to Boyd gaming taking over the casino."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places! The food is awesome and the staff is amazing. I have been here numerous times. The music on weekends is great, the wine choices are vast, mixed drinks are good as well. No matter what was ordered (steak, pasta, seafood, vegetables, chicken, etc) it's all been wonderful."}
{"text":"We ate breakfast here and my toast was cold, my potatoes were cold, and my hot tea water was barely warm. The only choice of jelly they had was grape and I don't like grape. We are locals and we will not try this place again! I am sure it will probably be out of business soon anyway."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!  We had 6pm reservations. After being seated around 6:15, we had to flag our waiter down to put in an order for an appetizer because we were being ignored. 6:45...we grab the manager because or dinner order had never been taken. 7:30-we still did not have food and left because when the manager checked on our order, the kitchen had not even started it and we had tickets to a show.  We will NEVER go back to this restaurant again. Wish I could give it ZERO stars!"}
{"text":"Is this place is awful! Wow. Haven't had that bad of a meal....ever. Calamari was the worst I've ever had. I managed to choke down my Greek salad but how can you mess that up."}
{"text":"Hedy and Mitch S. We celebrated our anniversary here and highly recommend this restaurant in the Aliante Hotel and Casino. It has an upscale atmosphere in the dining room and a casual lounge area if desired. We live in Las Vegas and have the pick of the finest restaurants. But the menu at Bistro 57 has an excellent selection done to perfection including the presentation of the food. The service is well above average. The waiter, Randy, had the timing between courses timed perfectly. We have dined here frequently, and considered going to a fine Las Vegas \"strip\" restaurant because it was our anniversary and a special occasion. We have gone to some fine restaurants in five star Las Vegas hotels and although excellent were not any more in first class than our experience at Bistro 57."}
{"text":"Dinner before movie on a friday night. Fish & Chips just sounds fabulous."}
{"text":"Terrible from top to bottom! Let me first say that we are not demanding customers, and rarely do we complain. We had much to complain about our dining experience this evening. The best way to contextualize it is amateur hour. The waiter was nowhere to be found, we got our appetizer 45 minutes after we were seated, and after an hour and fifteen minutes, the manager informed us that the kitchen was backed up and had not yet fired our entrees. We got up and left. The restaurant was fairly full, but far from slammed. A number of other customers also became upset, and got up and left. I have been to restaurants where the service was terrible, but this one topped them all. The Aliante should close the restaurant and bring in professionals to train the management, waitstaff, and kitchen. We will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"Service was top notch. Breakfast was great and to the detail wife had steak and eggs and I had scrambled eggs with toast coffee was very good. Will be back very friendly and comfortable dinning area"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!  Their happy hour is pretty generous as well.  Great atmosphere for a date or family gathering."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Bistro 57 before and we've always been happy. Tonight was one of the best meals we've ever had there. My wife and her friend had pan fried sole - cooked to perfection. Both said it was very good. I had the Chicken Milanese - the portion was huge (I brought home almost half of the chicken). The chicken was beautifully sauted. It's pretty easy to over cook a chicken fillet but this was perfect; tender and moist. My wife and I had the pomme frittes and they are a treat (our friend ordered the grilled asparagus so we shared the pomme frittes).  I started with French Onion soup just because I like it. It seems easy to make bad French Onion soup - I've had some that's too salty, some that's too bland - so I have to think there's a secret to getting it just right. Bistro 57 knows the secret.  The killer, the end to a perfect meal, was the cannoli. Sometime in my long life I must have had a great cannoli because I keep trying them wherever I can find them and I am always disappointed. Not this time. Without a doubt these were the best cannolis ever - crisp shell and the filling was just right.  Chef Francesco visited our table a couple of times to make sure we were happy. A very personable man. We were all very impressed with Bistro 57. Chef, who is from Southern Italy, says he's going to try new things. We can hardly wait."}
{"text":"The staff at Bistro 57 were kind and efficient. We sat in the bar for dinner and received ample attention--receiving our meals quickly and had our drinks refilled frequently.  My husband's meal, the veal, was beautifully delivered to our table and he thoroughly enjoyed it. I ordered the shrimp scampi and was not as impressed. The shrimp were small and the noodles seemed a bit overcooked with a sauce that tasted heavy. The food seemed more comfort food than bistro nouveaux.   The sangria was nice."}
{"text":"Friday night and only 7 tables full. Maybe because what is on the menu is not what they serve. We ordered the appetizer 'Artinasal cheeses with apples, grapes, and assorted crackers' for$12 - received water crackers (no assorted), 4 kinds of cheese (gouda, brie, pepperjack, a soft spreadable cheese), 2 strawberries, raisins, and honey. I could have gone to my local grocery store for this. Rest of the food was average. Not surprised this location has had so many different restaurants."}
{"text":"What a dump! Food was dreadful. They did not even offer a replacement for the pile of mush they described as seafood risotto The seafood was grilled separately to a rubber weapon consistency and wrapped around the edge The Manager was worthless  Stay away!"}
{"text":"Enjoying happy hour at Bistro 57 and it is... Oh. My. God. This goat cheese appetizer is so creative and soooo delicious. My $5 Merlot is very good, as well."}
{"text":"First of all: this is my second time here, and I wasn't impressed the first time.  This time, we went for heavy appetizers and drinks before seeing the new Star Wars movie.  Now, I'm a fan.  They streamlined down the menu and upscaled the liquor selection.  The bartender knew how to make a proper wet martini (and she was bloody gorgeous, which doesn't hurt, either).  The antipasti plate was full to the brim and delicious, the mussels were cooked perfectly, and there was a guy with a guitar playing in the bar who was great accompaniment to the meal.  I opened Aliante as a dealer back in 2008, and it has a special place in my heart.  I try to go there as often as I can, and now I have a favorite watering hole there in which to drink and munch.  If you're going to the movies and want a great little place for a drink and food before and/or after, this is a good place for you."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place is a disaster. The food quality is horrific, and they have increased the prices. It's like a bad joke that keeps getting worse. Service was okay, but it should be in an empty restaurant.   If you disrespect your clientele this much, the only option is to shut it down and reopen something else. When you raise the price of a dish by 8 dollars, and then use seafood that wouldn't be fit for a garbage buffet, it is beyond repair. We get it! You don't give a"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service and food at an extremely reasonable price.  First time here but will not be my last.  Had the second best Eggplant Parmesan I've ever had (second best because let's face it, you cannot beat a Sicilian restaurant in Boston) and it comes with a side of Fettuccine Alfredo which was the best I've eaten.  Our waitress Christine was awesome (and extremely easy on the eyes)! Again, great food, great service.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I feel bad that I'm finally reviewing this place after going for so long.  It used to be my favorite dinner place up North.  Apparently they changed Chefs and the place seems to have some transition issues.  They are out of half the menu items and don't have the dishes as listed on the menu.  We used to always had excellent service and we went on a Weekday recently when only the bar is open.  It was sooo bad. The servers seemed almost lost.  No refills, they didn't tell us that half our dishes were missing stuff bc they were out.  We ordered dessert and it took so long we finally cancelled it.  No apology, just okay.  One thing I don't understand, they were out of mayo.  Seriously?  Mayo?  They serve hamburgers.  Actually they used to have my absolute favorite burger but apparently it's being taken off the menu so no mayo either?  The manager here needs to get with his/her people and find a way to work this out.  Our last 3 visits were filled with lots of problems culminating with the last really bad dinner. It might be time to move on I guess. I hope this isn't an example of what happens when Boyd gaming takes over a property. I'm a little worried now."}
{"text":"Started with the escargot and it was quite good. I am picky on presentation and for sure this was a great dish. The mushrooms and diced tomatoes were a great compliment. Then had the baked penne pasta with sausage and it was also good. It was quite a full dish and I was unable to finish it due to thr portion size. All in all a good meal. Would say yes to try a meal here."}
{"text":"Service was as expected. Price was very reasonable. Atmosphere was comfortable and tasteful. That said, the coffee was bitter, the breakfast croissant was very, very greasy and the cheese that was used seemed like processed cheese.  The egg on the croissant had a crusty edge , but yet egg was cooked over medium as requested (pan was too hot). The potato wedges that were served on the side were just as greasy and had almost no seasoning. The french toast w/fruit topping was better, but over cooked for most people. I happen to like it a little on the crunchy side, but few would as the egg starts to scorch and taste bad."}
{"text":"Really a great restaurant - we are regulars. Chef Franco always comes up with amazing specials and it's always a great experience all around.  ....  Well that was before. Not the same restaurant after the chef left... Very limited menu , it's ok but nothing special"}
{"text":"Didnt even know this place existed :) what a nice little find. i think the place is stunning. very very nice decor... everything felt clean. fresh. trendy. very nice place to walk into with a date. Menu had a little bit of everything. we were happy with the choice. pricing also was excellent for such a nice place.  we got the hummus... potato leak soup. chicken and pizza. food was solid. not the best i have ever had - but everything was good. the whole bill was $42. it felt like a bargain for a nice dining experience. :) we will def be back. i recommend. nice find :)"}
{"text":"The food here wasn't really that good I had the veil with risotto and while I was eating I bit into a fish bone don't know where it came from if I was eating veil the bone stab the top of my mouth and it started to hurt so I ask the waiter if she knew where the bone came from and she asked the manager the manager came and ask a lot of question like if I placed it there he told me if I would like security will never come back here really bad service"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time before a show. We started out in the bar area for Happy Hour (HH). We ordered all 3 appetizers offered at HH prices (Calamari,  Hummus and Meatball Sliders) plus some drinks.  The food was excellent.  When our table was ready we were seated. Our server was excellent and so was the food. Huge portions too. I don't think I would make a special trip out there to eat but next time I'm at Aliante I'll probably stop by again."}
{"text":"Choose Bistro 57 due to its menu, it's atmosphere, and who doesn't like being greeted by the head chef at the hostess table!  Instant vibe upon walking in, live Spanish guitar player, cool bar, high ceilings, lots of ivory, blues and brown colors!  Very good happy hour specials with bar bites, but this is about my main dish.  Veal Parmesan with fettuccine olio, infused with the right amount of garlic!  Veal was perfect, crispy with a sweet marinara smothered in melted mozzarella, yum.  Portions were just a tad bigger than a European one, which was fine by me, I ate the whole thing.  Service was very good that would have been excellent if they offered cracked black pepper upon serving.  The food runner should have brought that with the fresh grated Parmesan cheese, a minor criticism.  So Bistro was a solid very good, I would dine there again!"}
{"text":"Very good! Everything is really good! Service: food : but have a special on the wine for Happy hr:( please!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Alliante Hotel and decided to try this place for breakfast. Diamond was our greeter both mornings we were there. What a pleasant and efficient gal!  Our meal was excellent on both occasions. Hey locals, check this place out if y ou love bagels and lox and all the fixings. $5  Yep, $5 for the whole deal. Are you kidding me?? This has to be the best deal going!  Check it out, I know you will like it!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible, the food was adequate and we won't be back. There were only a few tables seated but the servers were absent most of the time. It was a horrible experience."}
{"text":"I was reluctant to eat here because the place was empty, but it's actually a great place away from the strip.   The waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes and the chef even game out to talk to a neighbor during our dinner. I also loved how honest the waiter was about the dishes. I my mother was going to pick one dish and he flat out said that he didn't like it as much as a different dish and we absolutely agreed. I ordered the Florentine Pizza and she ended up having the Pasta Fra Diavolo. The pasta was delicious. I loved it, but what really impressed me was the pizza. It was simply incredible."}
{"text":"Yum! Came here for lunch. I got the Sarano Ham sandwich, my husband got the shepherd's pie. While both entrees were delicious, the shepherd's pie was to die for!!! I will be back to try out the breakfast. :-)"}
{"text":"Went in and sat at the bar. There was nobody serving behind the bar! Waited a while. Still no one came, although there were 3 people who were hosting? It was a Saturday night and opening hours are 4 to 10 pm. Very poor customer service, won't be returning! Aliante casino really needs to step up!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered drinks and a calamari while we looked over the menu. The server seemed frazzled but worked out the drink order easily enough. While waiting for the food, the chef could be heard yelling at the line cooks. This was the first indication something was wrong. As the manager approached the table next to us, he apologized for the delay in service and promised to comp their desert. This was the second indication things weren't running smoothly. After finishing some cocktails, we ordered a couple glasses of wine, still without our calamari and 15 minutes in. Relaxing became very difficult as the chef continued yelling at the cooks getting louder with each passing minute. About 20 minutes later we see our calamari come out of the kitchen but get delivered to the table next to us. When asking the waiter about the kitchen being slow, he confirmed that our order was delivered to the wrong table. Meanwhile, the table next to us was busy flagging down the manager to get the desert they were promised as he seemed to forget about their comp. After 45 minutes and an empty stomach full of wine, we asked for the check. It was hard to listen to the bumbling idiot of a chef yell orders at people while never actually getting behind the line to help. Also, even after acknowledging the error on the calamari, 15 minutes prior, they still didn't have a new one. Too bad stations doesn't own this place anymore, seems these owners are clueless on how to satisfy a customer.   By the way, we also tried to send an email to the Aliante but there is no place to find an email address or spot to let them know on their website."}
{"text":"I am not a big breakfast eater, but Bistro 57 might just change that.  Today I had the BEST breakfast I have had in years.   The Steak and egg breakfast was sublime. The steak;though thin was cooked to perfection and nicely seasoned. The over easy eggs also perfect and the hash browns where a delightful combination of onions, black pepper and a hearty potatoes.   Breakfast was also served with toast... ahh the toast.  I am not sure what kind of bread it was but it downright delicious.  The texture was crisp yet chewy with a delightful flavor and consistency. The toast was  perfect for dipping in my over easy eggs and even better with just a smear of jam.  I rarely give 5 star ratings, but the food service and atmosphere of Bistro 57 deserve it."}
{"text":"My wife an I stopped in Saturday evening.  We had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  This wasn't an issue s8nce mg wife hit a royal while we waited.  After being seated the manager came to our readers table to apologize for the wait.  The staff was amazing.  Very polite an quick.  Since we were flush with cash we decide to get the Calamari,  Escargot and Caprese salad.  The escargot was top notch.  Some of the best I ever had.  The caprese salad was delicious and the calamari was really good too. For drinks I ordered the Cucumber Cooler which was amazing,  the waiter suggested it and I was glad I tried it.   For the main meal I had the  Chicken Milanese which was great and my wife at the New York Strip which was one of the best steaks I've ever had.   Can't wait to go back.."}
{"text":"This is a lovely value-priced restaurant within the Aliante Casino resort.  First, the Chef is the best.  He often comes out to speak with you and see what you think.  You can ask for things to be custom made and he will do it for you.  The bruschetta is the best and definitely indulge in that.  I don't usually like that kind of thing, but here it is overflowing with tomatoes and just great.  The pasta (you choose sauce, pasta and so on) is also excellent.  I do wish they had a few more things on the entree menu as most are not good for a diet.  The wines are very reasonably priced and good.  Their specialty cocktails are also wonderful especially the cucumber martini.  Comfortable yet elegant."}
{"text":"We came to Vegas for a little mini \"honeymoon\" after our wedding because we are saving for a big trip next year. We stayed at the Aliante hotel and overall were pleasantly surprised. We wanted to have one \"nice\" dinner out and actually had reservations at \"Giada\" down on the strip. However, after our car getting broken into at the hotel and the majority of our wedding gifts stolen, we decided to opt for something cheaper for our nice dinner. We ended up at Bistro 57 which was very inexpensive and we didn't have to leave the hotel. We were seated immediately and greeted by a very friendly and professional server (I wish I remembered her name because she was PHENOMENAL). We started with the Bruschetta. Simple but perfect. My husband and I both dislike overly toasted bruschetta bread and this was just wonderful! Perfect way to start the meal. Then, we shared the beet and goat cheese salad. I would return to Vegas just for that! So nicely balanced and a beautiful presentation. For our main course, we both got the Lasagna  because we were in dire need of comfort food. We were a little skeptical because restaurant lasagna can go down hill real fast. No. This was delicious. Perfect ratio of cheese, meat, pasta, and sauce. For dessert we shared gelato but by that point, we were both just about too full. Everything was amazing and the whole evening was exactly what we needed after a stressful few days."}
{"text":"Very quick service. Glass was never half empty. Friendly people. Ate the angle hair with basil and added chicken. Needed a little salt but could definitely taste the basil. Plentiful. They also offer a large wine menu. Great ambiance."}
{"text":"Food was spectacular. Mom had the french onion soup and the caprese. Tomatoes were fresh, as was the mozzarella, and it was a good, rich balsamic. I had the caesar saad, whuch was tasty and creamy, and the lasagna, which was creamy and yummy. Service was fast and friendly. Chef came by to make sure everyone was happy. Small but decent wine list. For you locals, this is one casino restaurant you need check out."}
{"text":"The bare minimum of customer service could have altered this review and our future patronage but alas none was forthcoming. The first two times we ate here we had excellent fish & chips and went in last night looking to repeat the experience. The menu has been pared down to mainly \"Italian\" choices. Appetisers were slow to come - we were told there was a large party in the back after we asked, otherwise no explanation would have been proffered. When they arrived they were cold so we sent them back and said we'd wait for our mains. And wait we did. When they finally arrived they were fine, nothing to rave about and were delivered without any apology for the wait. Friends of ours who ate here last week had almost the exact experience. A few insincere words of acknowledgment that all wasn't as it should have been would have gone a long way. When we asked for our bill the server said \"I took the mushrooms off\" and plonked it down. I would have stiffed her if I'd had exact change."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars. A French restaurant in our end of town? Hmmmmm We ate here for breakfast. The prices had obviously went up on the buffet since it's not a stations casino anymore. So we ventured into this place next door. Wow was this ever a pleasant surprise. The eggs Benedict were done to perfection. The croissant was I am sure, baked in house and the potatoes had unique but great flavor. I had tea so I didn't try the coffee .... All this for the price of less than the buffet. This meal was great and a very nice surprise!"}
{"text":"The wife and I attended the soft opening today. The restaurant bills itself as French Inspired, but I noticed traditional Italian, Greek, as well as American fare. We started with a delicious Greek salad, full of olives, sweet yellow/red cherry tomato's, and feta. We tried the calamari, tender and succulent. The wife raved about her Seafood Risotto, served with shrimp, mussels, and diver's scallops. I had the osso buco over risotto. Delicious. The meat was tender, moist, and very flavorful. We ended up sharing a slice of ricotta cheesecake. Light and airy. I prefer a dense cheesecake, but all cheesecake is good. Unfortunately the wife and I rarely drink, but our waiter did mention 57 wines being available for service. We hope to return in about a week or so to see if the menu has changed. And we shall see if I can award Bistro 57 a fifth star once we have tried a few more dishes."}
{"text":"Food is really good and the price is unbelievably cheap for the quality.  Try the seafood risotto!  18 bucks for a saffron seafood risotto with scallops/shrimp/mussels.  You'd pay 46 bucks on the strip easy. The antipasto is good. Best restaurant around Aliante period."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying their breakfast and just the same as their lunch/dinner, I loved everything!  I still can't get over the quality of food at such great prices. We had lox and bagel and it was just outstanding. The lox was good and plentiful but the best part about it was it came with heirloom tomatoes! You shoulda seen how big my eyes got when the server put down the plate. Oh, that yellow tomato tasted as good as it looked. It was so fresh, sweet and delicious--what a pleasant surprise to have heirloom tomatoes with my breakfast! The quiche Lorraine was really good with a perfect, flakey crust. It came with a side of field greens in a simple citrusy dressing.  I can't say enough good things about this place. It's the best thing that's happened to NLV. I hope they continue to be able to put out high quality food at these incredible prices for long as they possibly can. I will be back. A lot."}
{"text":"Great service by all.  The manager greeted us at our table, and was pleasant when suggesting wine options and his choices. Casual yet classy enough to dress up or down.  Nice size appetizers."}
{"text":"In an attempt to broaden our culinary horizons beyond Aliante Casino and Hotel's buffet and food court, my boyfriend and I visited Bistro 57 to try their happy hour specials. Except, their happy hour is from 4-6pm, which sucks if you work across town and can't zoom here in time. No matter, we ordered from their regular menu instead.  Speaking of the menu, it needs to be more descriptive than it currently is.   Appetizer - Calamari: The menu describes the calamari as \"tossed with spicy peppers. However, our server said it was the marinara sauce that was spicy, and that it could be made it without peppers . The calamari was good, but what was terrible about it was how the excess oil wasn't drained.   Gourmet Premium Burger: I went bun-less with this and chose brie as my cheese of choice. The patty, which I requested to be cooked at medium-rare, was too thick for my preference. I'm glad that I ordered this protein-style because I had to knife and fork the patty. This also came with a side of soggy potato slices or some sad version of potato chips. Whatever those were, they're not mentioned in the description.  Service: Unlike other Yelpers, we didn't experience slow service, and our server was attentive to our table.   Overall: I won't be returning. The greasy, mediocre food was unsatisfying."}
{"text":"If you must, and you're at the casino, and you're hungry, then I guess you can eat here. I wouldn't recommend making this a destination though... Nothing is unique or exceptional... I would normally give it a 2 star, but the crew was trying and were friendly.   Given the fact that Vegas has lots of options to eat, this didn't make the bar... Perhaps they're trying to be a gourmet destination, I am not sure, but the menu is not special, the food was not either.  Bread was stale, and the warmth said microwave all the way. Salad was not fresh. The burger was interesting and I would recommend it, or perhaps an Italian dish, 'cause my friends loved theirs.  It's A-Ok."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with my family. our server was Brian. On a couple of occasions, he would forget our request or the bread basket. However, he was extremely hospitable and friendly. It is waiters like Brian that make eating out an enjoyable experience. The chef and general manager asked our table how everything was. We tried out the antipasta plate. it was very authentic and delicious. I also ordered the sangria! it was very refreshing and tasty. Our dinners were somewhat mediocre. However, I am giving this review solely based on the service. if you dine in, definitely request Brian!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice interior design, but I think their menu isn't that great. It is very limited, pricey, and the food quality doesn't live up to the price you pay for your meal. We came in as soon as it opened, and the service was very sluggish. I was always running low on water, and I had to battle for the watress' attention to get a refill (when we were practically the only people there).   I ordered their crispy calamari tossed for $8.00. It was mixed with black peppers. It was good, and the gave it a different flavor to the typical calamari appetizer. I also ordered the chicken milanese with arugula salad and asparagus for $14.00. That was ok. The breading on the milanese was indifferent and I only had 4 pieces of asparagus (and I love asparagus).   I think my experience was just a one time only deal. I just feel like the service didn't make up for the quality in their food. The hostess seemed confused , on top of being on her phone upon checking in. The manager was nice enough to offer us free dessert, and I thought that was a very nice gesture of him."}
{"text":"Had some clients in town. Booked them at the casino because it was close to our appointment today. They were starved so we went to the Bistro for the first time. The server Jamie was awesome.   4 of us. The soups were good. The salad had quality greens. We had the mushroom app.  One guest had the lasagna which he really liked. Another guest had the salmon which looked good and was good despite being a little over. Another guest had the eggplant which he liked.  I had the seafood risotto and I had issues. The risotto itself was good but the seafood was plain and dry. It was served around the sides of the risotto. The shrimp had no flavor. The clams were dry and the meat was small. The muscles were ok but two of them had broken bits of the shell in it. They should saute the seafood in maybe butter and garlic, drain and then place on the plate.  Server 5 stars Lasagna 5 stars Salmon 4 stars Eggplant 4 stars Risotto 2 stars"}
{"text":"This was the first time I ate here and I really enjoyed it. My wife received a coupon in the mail and that drew us in. We sat at a table in the bar area and the bartender gave us great service. She was great at keeping our drinks full.  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I had the veal and it was wonderful. The serving was huge, so I had the rest for lunch the next day. My wife had some seafood, but didn't enjoy her meal as much.  Dinner was a great experience and I look forward to going again."}
{"text":"The waitress was sweet. The beet and goat cheese salad was great. Loved the French Onion soup. My husband had the special, Osso Bucco. He said it was good. My pasta was fairly forgettable. The bread pudding was fabulous!"}
{"text":"A new restaurant with some of the rough edges showing. I'll give them another shot."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of problems. First, they call themselves an Italian restaurant but they don't even make their own pasta or gnocchi! Most of their wine is from California! On top of all this the service is slow and the staff is not very helpful when you have questions about the menu. The potential is there since the space and decor is great. When I read the chef was from northern Italy I was really excited to taste some authentic Italian but was sorely disappointed. I was there with a large party and not one person was happy with their meal. If a person likes this place, they probably love Olive Garden but the prices are better at Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I love the happy hour here! Great variety of cocktails that are delicious. Great food as well. Friendly service. Good prices! What more do you need? Cheers!"}
{"text":"Back in the day, like 2012 or early 2013, I used to come here a lot.  I would come here just to chill, have a drink, and people watch.  It wasn't until recently, that I finally had a meal here.  We dined here because we wanted to try something different.  Plus, it's so close to our home.  Service from start to finish was exceptional.  The chef even came out to check on us.  I was craving steak, but our waiter recommended the seafood special for the evening, which was two filets of Swai cooked in butter.  Swai is very difficult to prepare correctly.  The fish breaks down so easily and it's very tough to cook without drying it out.  Our waiter convinced me to try it.  He stated that I won't regret it.  So, I went for it.  I also got a side of their meatballs just in case the fish wasn't big enough. I got my meal and was actually shocked that I got over 10 oz. of fish for less than $20 in a restaurant.  I have to admit that it was one of the best prepared Swai's that I have ever had.  It was flaky and very buttery.  Taste reminded me of Black Link Cod or Butter Fish.  I guess I didn't need the extra side of meatballs anyway.  I still ate them.  I instantly became a fan of Bistro 57 after having just one dish, the Swai.  My girlfriend had their lasagna.  I'm sure it was good because she ate most of it.   Will I be back? Bistro 57 is close to our home, the food is good, and the service is excellent. I'm sure that I will be back.    2017 Yelp Review #47"}
{"text":"Came to Aliante over the weekend, stopped in for dinner, all other restaurants were full needing reservations, so we just ordered appetizers, we ordered the fried calamari, stuffed mushrooms. Mushrooms were a bit salty and the calamari was just ok at best. We started off with a Caesar salad that was just completely WILTED, horrible!!!! Won't be back....."}
{"text":"We did the drop in, as we now are back in Las Vegas and have not been to this place in over 2 years. My husband and I were blown away at the amazing menu that was presented to us. As soon as I saw the Seafood Risotto I knew I had to try it. My husband chose the Grilled New York Strip- both were amazing! We hardly took a breath! We started the meal with the cheese assortment, delish! Although I think I will opt for the escargot on our next visit. Next came the delicious main course and finally we tried the creme brulee and mascarpone cheesecake - both excellent. Service was great, drinks were on point and the bill was incredibly reasonable for the quality of food we had. Please don't pass up this great dining experience- I actually liked it better than MRKT!"}
{"text":"Went Bistro 57 with a friend from out of town on a Saturday night and I knew it was going to be a bad experience when it took 20 minutes and 3 requests to get sweetener for my iced tea.  So, by this time I'm irritated and the service doesn't improve.  The food we ordered was OK, but not great.  I live near Aliante Casino and go there for dining an movies periodically.  Bistro 57 has changed names and management several times since Aliante Casino opened about 9 years ago.  I've visited this restaurant each time it's changed hands and the place seems to be cursed.  Either the food isn't good or the service is bad or both, but they just can't seem to get it together.  It's a shame because the restaurant itself is in a good location in the casino, is a good size and has nice furnishings and ambiance, but the service and/or food never seem to get lined up.  Won't waste time or money going back."}
{"text":"This place is very good! The service is great and atmosphere is very relaxed. The staff is very prompt with refills and very nice. I highly recommend this restaurant, if you are looking for a quiet place to enjoy dinner."}
{"text":"Average now that Chef Franco isn't employed by the restaurant.  We started with  bruscheta, very good. Followed by roasted beat salad, good. Asked for bread at the table, every other table had a basket.  Asked for bread again, appetizer and salad finished. Requested carabonari, which Chef Franco would make for us, waiter said they couldn't do special orders, they were short on help. There were no dinner specials either. So, we got the veal scalopini and seafood risotto.  Veal was tough, seafood good.  Half way finished with dinner, finally got some bread. Waiter said short on staff. So, things have changed since Boyd gaming took over, not for the better. Bistro use to be a hidden gem up North."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place twice now, once at breakfast and once at lunch. Breakfast is 7am-11am, FYI.  The breakfast menu isn't large by any means but it has everything you could want. I got the bagel with cream cheese and lox (smoked salmon). The bagel isn't a large one but it's just right. The lox is amazing. It's the best lox I've had on this side of the country and the best I've had since I went to a mom-and-pop bagel shop in NYC. The lox slices are large enough to cover the entirety of the bagel and then some. They also gave a more than ample amount of cream cheese. They also have a scrambled eggs and lox with caramelized onions and toast. It looked and smelled very tasty but I didn't get to have any.  For lunch I had the fish and chips. The chips were magnificent and the fish was perfectly cooked in a light breading. The chips had a crispy outside and a potato-y center and cooked just right. I don't know what kind of fish they use but it's probably cod or tilapia.  With both breakfast and lunch I had their caramel macchiato. Way better than Starbucks or Coffee Bean! Had just the right mix of flavor between coffee and caramel.  The serving sizes aren't small but they're not overly large, either. You'll get a decent full but not too full off the serving sizes.  The servers and management are very friendly and provide great service. The prices are some of the best for this style and calibre of restaurant in town. I couldn't recommend giving this place a try at least once!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by the appearance.  Although we should have been forewarned that on a Sat at 11:30 place was empty!  Food was very avg salty tuna Croissant sandwich OJ was a bit tart Coffee was like water Croissant sandwich was fine. Fruit on the side was sour.  Service VERY SLOW Had to ask for breakfast menu"}
{"text":"I have to be fair. Our server Rob was really nice and helpful and the manager Vanessa too.  But the food is terrible.  I can make a better pasta alfredo !!!!!!  I won't go back there.  I prefer to drive a little bit more for a decent meal."}
{"text":"I used to come here often, when it was Pasta Cucina.  I ordered fish and chips via take out.  It's a full meal, you won't be hungry afterward.  Tartar seems homemade and is good.   The potato chips are also homemade but a bit soggy.   This is nit picky, but they should cut slits in the take out container when packing fried foods to let the steam escape.  If I try different dishes in the future and they are as good, then I'll increase the rating."}
{"text":"We came by to check this place out for our weekly date night. We had high hopes for it as it's very close to our house and seems nice inside. We sat in the bar; which was fine except for the service was very poor and the food left much to be desired. While the staff was friendly, they lacked professionalism or a sense of awareness when it came to things going on in the restaurant. While this may be understandable when a restaurant is packed, it is unacceptable when there are 6 people eating.  The menu was limited and not what we saw online. The food that we did order was bland and oily.  Needless to say, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is ok! There's nothing that screams out about it.... Nothing too special. The environment is nice and so was the service, but it was missing something and I can't put my finger on it!"}
{"text":"We love this place ! Seems like we come here quite often, because of great food, friendly stuff, reasonable price, and plus military discount !!!"}
{"text":"Everything was great until the end. Desert and final check took forever. I think they forgot about us after we told them everything was great. Service needs to be always to the end."}
{"text":"So I looked up reviews before coming here but I would of ended up here regardless because we were invited out to eat.. the location and price point were right for our group of three adults and three kids. It's Aliante and I wasnt expecting anything awesome but I was super excited to try the french onion soup that is splattered in the photo section.. I was happy I tried it out because  it was really really YUMMY... However DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU ARE ON A TIME CRUNCH. The service is SUPER SUPER SLOW. The waitress was great about getting the kids food out and to us but the main entrees and refills of beverages..not so much..we literally had to flag down a bus boy to get her to come take our dessert order...My boyfriend who usually is the calm one was even getting upset because his water glass was empty.. Overall I would of preferred going to T.G.I.F Fridays if given the choice and probably wont be back here but the food tasted good and the desserts are yummy we got the mascapone cheesecake and the smores cheesecake and both were delicious..as I stated earlier the soup was yummy and the salad tasty but everything else was just MEH and not even worth a mention...."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is amazing! Place drew my eye every time we walked by so I definitely wanted to try it. Food was ok; nothing earth scattering but good. Pistachio gelato was phenomenal though. Rob, our server, was very nice which I always appreciate! :)"}
{"text":"I can't give enough praise to Theresa and her team here! My little sister got married at The Grove at 3:30 Memorial Day and couldn't afford a reception there so we looked around for cheaper options.     Theresa was willing to work with our small budget. They set up the private room with a sweetheart table and let us bring some of our own decor! They even set up a table for the guest book. We had a fantastic Happy Hour!! Everything was set up family style.   We had Meat and cheese platters, Every single one of the flatbreads, chicken parmesan sliders and meatball sliders. Everything was delicious. This restaurant is beautiful and honestly looked like we spent way more than we did! The happy hour drinks were very reasonably priced! Our server was Christine and she was such a doll! Very attentive and willing to accommodate!   I even ruined the cake transporting it to the restaurant and the cook was amazing and fixed it for me so the bride never knew!! Overall everyone has an amazing time! I highly recommend them for excellent service and good food! They went above and beyond! I'm very impressed! Thank you so much for making the evening so special for my sister! xoxo"}
{"text":"I haven't had time to write reviews since I moved here a month ago, but I will also say the service my friends and I have been receiving hasn't been the best... until tonight! We stumbled upon Bistro 57 after watching TMNT (great movie btw) and decided to have some drinks and snacks. I was pleased to find out they made their own Caesar dressing and they had a great selection of cured meats and cheese to make your own cheese board! My friends got dessert, which were also pretty good! This place was pretty average but got extra points for service. Laura was probably the best server we've had in Vegas. She was friendly and definitely kept us entertained. We always had drinks filled and she seemed to enjoy making sure we were having a good time. Definitely suggest Bistro 57 as a place to relax and hang out with your friends"}
{"text":"Bistro 57! A French style restaurant hiding inside Aliante Casino.  From reading other reviews, I wasn't expecting too much truthfully...but I had a deal on this place, and decided to check it out!  Started off with Escargot:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bistro-57-north-las-vegas?select=snQzDf6YM1lZxRzNbk7NeA#snQzDf6YM1lZxRzNbk7NeA  It's simple with Garlic Butter with Crostini and wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. A little chewier than I've had in the past, and the flavors didn't really pop. Can't really recommend the escargot here.  I went with the Osso Buco with Porcini Risotto :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bistro-57-north-las-vegas?select=CSdJmC931Bhq9-chmTcw4A#CSdJmC931Bhq9-chmTcw4A  The Veal is cooked perfectly, and is super tender...just pulled apart with a fork! But the risotto was very heavy...like a mushroom gravy, and was not amazing in my book. It's the first time I've had this dish, so I can't compare...but I thought it was just \"ok\"  Also tried the Grilled New York Steak with Pommes Frites & Arugula Salad :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bistro-57-north-las-vegas?select=ZPAcyYVosejoM01vawZzdQ#ZPAcyYVosejoM01vawZzdQ  First steak came out well done instead of medium rare...second came out perfect. It was a decent steak, but hard to compare to all the great steakhouses in Vegas!  And to finish, Creme Brulee of course!   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bistro-57-north-las-vegas?select=z0wvnIk0VK4I_oo0yIo9cw#z0wvnIk0VK4I_oo0yIo9cw  The management comped the dessert since the steak was overcooked, and this was a large portion, plenty big for two to share. Yummy!  Overall, this place was good but not great. I felt like it was a little spendy for what it is, but since I had the deal here, it was still worth the money. Just can't say I will be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"We've been to all the Aliante Casino and Hotel restaurants including the food court.  We decided to try Bistro 57 since it was the least crowded restaurant on the property on a Friday night.  We were seated immediately and sat in the booth we wanted which was great.  Afterwards, the lack of service forced us to leave.  After being seated for 10 minutes, our waitress never came by.  The restaurant was not crowded and there were ample waitresses around.  As someone who takes his family out frequently for good meals and service in the local area, the lack of attention signified to us much about how the management operated their establishment.  As we walked out, our waitress finally showed up...too late.  I gave this restaurant 2 stars for cleanness and our host who gave us immediate attention.  Everything else was disappointing by far.  I won't be back here with my family."}
{"text":"Great meal!  After being out of town for four+ months, we returned to Bistro 57 for Wed/Thur Happy Hour (1/2 price pizza and pasta). We were surprised with the best meal we have ever had there. In a word - SAUCES!  Rich, thick, and flavorful. This chef (Francesco De Furia) knows his sauces!  My wife had the Spaghetti Alla Bolognese ($13) which was covered with a rich, meaty, and expertly seasoned sauce. I enjoyed the Pasta Al Forno ($14) which was bursting with flavor - and again a rich, flavorful sauce, served with toasted garlic bread slices. (Great for sopping up the sauce!). We live across the street in Sun City Aliante and have been visiting this restaurant since its opening nearly 7 years ago (through various incarnations, managers, and chefs). This chef is a keeper!  For dessert, Jamie, our server, recommend the delicious (rich) in-house made (and not on the menu) caramel cheesecake which topped off a great evening.  If I seem to be raving about the food, it is because this is the best we have seen since Aliante (formerly Station) Casino opened in 2008. We will spread the word - and return often. (Now, if Rosemary's will ever reopen downtown)."}
{"text":"We came here for a Free ice coffee and Caramel Macchiato for $1 on a Friday morning.   - Avoid the resort fee and get your free Wi-Fi here.  - Nice seating. Good place to take a break from it all.  - No real complaints about the coffee since it was free. Staying at the hotel, they give you free vouchers for coffee and $2 off specialty coffee drinks.  - Starbucks taste better. Needs to be stronger."}
{"text":"We were planning to have a movie and dinner night.  I was also craving for some escargot so we ended up in Aliante.  I was excited to have a French restaurant close to home.    So we ordered escargot and got osso buco.  I was torn between croque monsieur and steak frites because those were some of my favorites when I went to Paris.  The escargot was all sorts of weird.  Escargot only has a few components: snails, garlic, clear butter and sometimes parsley.  Their version had all sorts of garbage: tomatoes, pancetta, creamy butter, mushrooms and yeah, snails.  I was extremely disappointed but I was hoping my entree would be better.  Knowing this was at a former Station casino, I decided on getting steak frites because that would be hard to mess up.  Boy, was I wrong!  I like my steak medium rare.  They served me a dry well-done piece of carcass.  I was going to suck it up and eat it anyway but the friend insisted I get the right steak the way I ordered it.  The osso buco with risotto was sad-looking.  It was a brown lump of blah with a petrified rosemary twig.  It wasn't as tender as it should be.  We were already done eating by the time I got my second steak.  This time, my beef wasn't extra dead.   The steak frites was edible but not good.  I've never had steak I didn't finish or take home until last night.  The service was great.  Our server, Kris, was polite and helpful.  The manager came to our table to apologize for the steak mishap and comped our creme brulee.  If this review was just based on food alone, I'd give them 1 star but they get a bump because of the service.  This place used to be an Italian restaurant and should've stayed that way.  Bistro 57 calls itself \"European-inspired\" but the food was absolutely uninspired.  I wish I could say the food was forgettable because believe me, I'd rather forget I ate here."}
{"text":"Hold your nose! Better yet, stay home. Nothing about the place is remarkable except the Faust wine and raspberry cheesecake. The baked pasta was mushy and the sauce horrible. The hummus tasted sour. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. First started eating at this establishment when they initially opened in the Aliante many years ago.   They have changed names and hands approximately 4 times since opening. Reluctantly decided to give them another try and the disappointment still continues to plague this restaurant. Very sad"}
{"text":"We are going back to Bistro 57 tonight.   We had a delicious meal 2weeks ago.....pan fried sole which I will order again, with a tasty arugula salad on the side.   We ate in the bar and the service was excellent.  We were especially pleased to meet the chef as he came to our table to check on all of us.  We were excited to hear about some of the new dishes he will be introducing.  We also enjoyed the light dinner music.  We definitely feel that the manager is on top of things and making sure customers are having a a good experience at Bistro.  Keep up the good work Bistro....we enjoy dining with you.  But wish you were open on Tuesday evenings....all the seniors coming out of the movie show could then come dine at Bistro."}
{"text":"BLUF: It's perfectly fine. Not great, not bad, but fine. If you want some Italian and are staying at the Aliante, this fits the bill.  Service was decent. Everyone was very friendly, just took a bit longer than expected.  Food is where I'm singing them a bit. I got the chicken parm. Good serving of chicken, small serving of noodles. I asked to get fettuccini instead of spaghetti noodles, which they were happy to do, but the entire serving of noodles was hidden under the chicken when I got it. I moved them out for the attached picture. This led to about three bites of chicken per bit of noodle, which was a little unfortunate. The tomato sauce was kind of bland. It didn't taste bad by any means just wasn't special at all.   The cost seemed about average for places at the hotel and casino.   If I wanted Italian and didn't feel like leaving the hotel, I'd go back. If I was ok with a little drive though I'd most likely try somewhere else."}
{"text":"The Osso Buco with Risotto was to die for! Sad that the French Onion Soup and Bruschetta are no longer on the menu though!"}
{"text":"I'd say 3.5 stars.  Had eggplant Parmesan and was good, tasty but should be bit more eggplant, less pasta.  Pizza was bland.  Need more seasoning for sure.  Crust was thin as it should be.  Service was very good.  Had to eat in bar cause we walked in."}
{"text":"Wow, great attitude from everyone here. Awesome beer options and the bartender Knows how to make her Manhattan.... Will definitely come back again. Too bad they close too early."}
{"text":"Not sure why my seafood rositto didn't look like the pics on here. There was no scallops. The seafood was shrimps, clams, 1 mussel, and squids. Rositto is basically cheesy rice.  The waitress was nice & friendly. The atmosphere & interior were great!  The only suggestion to management is order paper bags with Bistro 57 printed on them. That way customers wouldn't have to carry around leftovers in a cheap \"Thank You\" plastic bag. Lol!"}
{"text":"Family and I enjoyed the appetizers, salad and variety of pizzas.  Server Ben was attentive, personable, and fun."}
{"text":"Salad had dish soap in it opening weekend. Give them a few months to work out the kinks."}
{"text":"My daughter gave me a gift certificate for Bistro 57  she won as part of a basket she bid on at a charity auction, and I finally took my boyfriend and went on 9/4.  I have to tell you, one look at the menu and 1. I wasn't sure we'd be able to spend the entire $100 with the average price of an entree under $20; and 2. Normally prices like that would mean mediocre food at best.  We were both extremely surprised when the first thing we ordered, the goat cheese, became one of my favorite appetizers ever....and I've eaten some of the best Las Vegas has to offer.  The rest of the meal followed the same trend in that it was all extremely flavorful, generous portions, and some of the best food in this city.  And we DO have some great food in Vegas.  We asked the waiter, who was new but did an awesome job taking care of us and impressing us with his knowledge of the menu, who the chef was, and he stated the chef had only been there a couple weeks but was determined to shake things up a bit.  I'd say he has succeeded!  I live way down in the southwest part of the Valley, and I will most definitely be driving up to Aliante to visit the Bistro again.  And again.  Kudos to some yummy food in a nice atmosphere at extremely reasonable prices! next time I will meet the chef!"}
{"text":"We were SO impressed with bistro 57!   We came here for my birthday dinner, wanting something a little nicer than the buffet for a change. Wasn't sure how it would rate, a lot of places in North Vegas LOOK great but can't back it up with their food. That was NOT the case here! We were seated at a very elegant booth and a great waiter (Brandon?) took really excellent care of us.   We ordered two glasses of Merlot, the goat cheese-marinara garlic bread appetizer and some bruschetta to start. Heavenly. BIG portion appetizers, fresh ingredients and beautifully presented. Wow! We followed it up with a lasagna dinner entree. So fresh and flavorful, one of the best lasagnas out there.   Our waiter was perfect: not over bearing, not ignoring us....just the perfect level of attentiveness and that made for a perfect dining experience. That's experience for you, it shows. Especially loved that the chef came out into the dining room and greeted each table asking about the food. Nice guy, very genuine!   I am coming back often. The food is superb and the service was outstanding. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I am getting sick and tired of restaurants in this economy that don't know how to treat a customer.  It is not like they are over flowing with customers at best 1/4 filled.  I ordered the Croque Madam  when it came out the egg yolk was ice cold.  I asked the waiter if he could replace the egg.  Rather than just bring out a new sandwich the waiter came out and essentially blamed me and said the cook said that the egg was not cold.  Now I am irritated and ask to speak to the manager, a few minutes later, the so called executive chef comes out and continues to insult me.  Don't waste your time with this restaurant, food is sub par the executive chef is clueless and the service is even worse.  They should just close the entire Aliante Casino.  It is one of the worst Casinos to eat at or gamble at."}
{"text":"This was a nice find!  From an eclectic menu, I opted first for Escargot with Garlic Butter & Crostini, which was an unusual-looking, yet very tasty indented tray of cooked snails with tomatoes, mushrooms, and Garlic Wine Sauce, along with excellent Garlic Bread.  Calamari Fritti was tasty, as well.  And, complimentary doughy bread was very well received.  Next up was an excellent cheesy crock of French Onion Soup, followed by a very good large Caesar Salad with creamy Italian Dressing, Romaine Lettuce leaves, cheese, and hard croutons.  Pan Roasted White Fish was moist, delicate, and delicious, served with a small amount of warm Arugula Salad and very tasty Italian Roasted Potatoes.  So were the Fried Potatoes that served as Chips for the Battered Fish & Chips that I also got to sample.  Service was quite accommodating and helpful.  Our waiter even offered to make Decaf Iced Tea from scratch for me, and did so.  Live music could be heard from the next room, and booth seating was quite comfortable.  The only discordant note was a real slow kitchen.  A huge break between starters and delivery of entrees almost caused my party of four to miss the start of the movie we came to see at Regal Aliante Stadium 16 located in the same building.  A solid 4 stars overall!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place has to have a five star Italian Chef.  The food is suberp and Italian is my specialty.  If you know the difference, you will notice right away the flavors and quality of the food.  This place is a hidden gem.  I hope this place never closes and I hope it gets recognized for its Outstanding Food.  Price is great too which is a surprise."}
{"text":"They have a delicious happy hour menu it's my wife's and mine go to date night spot when you're pretty good food affordable price. The gentleman that served us forgot his name but he was very attentive super friendly and kept the door open for us.my great grandmother my uncle and wife all enjoyed there delicious meal."}
