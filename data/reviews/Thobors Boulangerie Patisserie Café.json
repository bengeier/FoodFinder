{"text":"Since this location opened, I've bought their baguette several times (very good), and tried a number of their pastries and tarts. These may not be on bar with what one gets in France (sometimes I wonder if there's something wrong with the water in T.O.), but they're better than most in this city. The neighbourhood is definitely better off with the addition of Thobor's."}
{"text":"Just served one of their flourless chocolate cakes for a large dinner gathering in my home, and everyone raved over it - looked delicious and melted in one's mouth. What a hit!!

Customer Service, vast Selection, and Cozy in-store Cafe are also Great too."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special at all. Their beignets had no flavour and had massive air pockets in the middle, their croissants were quite dry and their macaroons were heavy and lacked flavour. They are not a typical french patisserie/boulangerie at all. There are many, many better options in the city."}
{"text":"Only popped in for a coffee, just before they closed. Nice addition to this neck of the woods.  
Will come back to try the food 
And desserts to see if it tastes as good as it looks."}
{"text":"Quite pricey for what I received. 1 pretty avergage sandwich and a coffee for $11. Nothing bad but nothing praiseworthy. Will not be returning here any time soon."}
{"text":"A nice addition to the neighbourhood.  Warm cozy and  spacious feeling cafe. 
They offer a variety of delicious French pastries. They also have a good selection of savoury dishes such as quiches and sandwiches as well. They do not make a good americano, its a bit weak for my tastes.

February 2017 Update: The coffee situation has improved. Still not the best americano in the city but it's much better than before!"}
{"text":"This new location of Thobors is a very welcome addition to the neighborhood: their commitment to French indulgence is much appreciated. Located close to a massive dig site near Eglinton West station the storefront stands out because of its signature citrus orange. It is seemingly a hit with the community because each time I have been to the cafe, it seems to be doing brisk business.

Thobors claims to serve the best baguette in the city, and while I can't attest to that claim I am a big fan: they are slender with tapered ends, light to the touch and chewy.

The selection of confitures while not extensive packs a punch. I picked up a small jar of the 'Christmas Jam' just before the holidays and it's a decadent mix of apricots, walnuts, prunes, figs and spices. 

The mini quiches are very good with a nice subtlety (depending on the additional ingredients) to the creamy and eggy insides. Understandably they were quite cold. Even though my order was to go, the otherwise very friendly and accommodating staff could've offered to heat the quiches up, which they didn't.

I picked up an apple pie to serve as desert for Christmas dinner and it was delicious: not too sweet or tart, generously appley and nutty. However, the crust was a bit soggy at the bottom and stuck to the packaging.

I look forward to enjoying the fruits of Thobors' labor and bringing my homesick Parisian friends to this location for a slice of their homeland."}
