{"text":"It's great! Inexpensive Tex-mex food, cheap beer, and good music. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"Please, please add quesadillas to the \"late night menu.\" C'mon, it can't be that hard, yo!"}
{"text":"So me and a couple of friends came here for a celebration dinner. My friend picked it out since I'm a big taco/burrito lover. We were the only people in the place at dinner time except the few people at the bar. The atmosphere and music was pretty chill. I liked it. All the different tables/chairs were unique. The menu is small. I mean small. No variety. A taco was 2.50 but if you wanted meat in it, it was 1.50 more. The whole menu was like that. 6.50 for a burrito with no meat. So after adding chicken to it, ONE taco was 4 and a burrito 8. Also they don't come with sides!  No chips or anything. So I paid like 8 something for a chicken quesadilla and nothing else. I wanted black beans in it. Got charged for the black beans but they didn't put them in there. The food was bland. Got that from all people present at the table. Had been eying this place a while coming up and down monroe but I think that will be my last time."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is amazing and so is the staff.  It's seriously the best salsa and quesadillas ever!  Highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"LOVED the atmosphere of the restaurant. very eclectic and vibrant. however, I cannot say the same about the food or drinks. we ordered a pitcher of margaritas and I kid you not, almost spit it out when I tried the first sip. our waiter said they make their own bitters and mix in house but no one in my party was able to drink the pitcher. the food was average, nothing special. my friends taco meat was well plus (burnt). I wouldn't give up on it completely (after all, we were there at 2PM on a Sunday) but it's definitely not top on my list to go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, some of the best black velvet pictures you'll fine and vintage Decore. The staff was friendly.. The food was equally as awesome we never been before so ordered 4 different menu items all was good but the quesadilla and the  Southwest eggrolls was king of hill... full bar which is a bonus... go on a date or with a group of friends you will enjoy it.. jukebox was playing some kicking vintage tunes as well"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Similar vibe to their Thirsty Beaver bar, but they have yummy TexMex food and better parking. I hear the owners have plans for outside events too. Like them on Facebook to stay up to date.  You should definitely check this out. It's now one of my fave spots."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous, the ambiance was more like a bar. 

Chimichanga - really good - rice, cheese, corn, onions - next time I'll ask for no cheese on top. 

My friend really liked her meal too."}
{"text":"Some good food!! I had the sizzler platter with chicken, my husband had the burrito, my friend had the chimichanga and another one had the taco salad all of it A++ You cant beat the prices either, I think every menu item was priced under 10."}
{"text":"For me, this place was just okay. It's a dive bar, weird decorations, old music and a pretty simple menu. 

I went for dinner and ordered a margarita and chimichanga. I agree with Peter I pretty much ordered it just because I like saying chimichanga...

Honestly, the it was pretty standard, nothing special but not bad. I did add queso but on the side. I like my chimichanga when it keeps a bit of the crispy goodness with every bite. 

 The margarita was pretty tasty - if I come back I'd grab drinks only. I'm not a fan of paying for chips and salsa - mostly because I have zero self control when they are in front of me. Luckily, our waitress was nice enough to refill them for us, not sure if that's standard or not but it was a very nice gesture. 

Overall, it's an A-OK for me."}
{"text":"Great just-as--you-are-type neighborhood bar. Parking is great especially in comparison to Big Sister Thirsty Beaver. Indoor and outdoor seating and full bar with some hot, hot spicy dishes and laid back atmosphere. Super place for having a cold one outdoors on a warm,sunny day with your best furry friend!"}
{"text":"So this place barely got 3 stars, and only because food was decent. I went with two friends last night before a show at Ovens, so we were kind of on a restricted time frame. We sat ourselves, and the waitress took a few minutes to come say hello, which was more of a \"I'll be with you in a minute\" in passing. Eventually she took our drink orders. I was considering getting a beer after my initial water but she was not interested in speaking to us after we finally got our chips and queso. We then ordered and waited about 30-40 min for a quesadilla and 2 burritos. Problem: trivia night and only had one (visible) person making food. My quesadilla was pretty good, I got steak and avocado added in, but had to ask twice for sour cream (which was already on the menu so not sure why I didn't get any to begin with). Waitress did apologize for the wait, and ended up giving my friend a 3rd free beer before leaving, but whether or not she actually cared is debatable. 

The scene was interesting. I get the theme- it feels like a random saloon in a desert decorated with random old stuff and bright colored lights. 

Over all, if I am in this area again, and have more time to enjoy a restaurant without a time restriction, I may come back to give it a second chance. The trivia really helped my overall feelings towards this place because it gave us something to talk about other than how slow/limited our service was. Unfortunately not many options in the area, which is why we ended up here, but if you want to try a Tex-mex place, I'd just suggest somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's ok.  Low key food.  They're not so good at requests like no cheese.  But it's cheap and casual.  And a little too loud."}
{"text":"The decor is really cool and the chimichangas are so good. The liquor selection is pretty, but when I asked the bartender what she would recommend she just kind of shrugged and said they didn't have much for specialty drinks. Overall it offers good food and atmosphere at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Super impressed with everything! Had low expectations going in as I hadn't heard of it & it looked kinda blah from outside but man was I glad my gf talked me into it! Best quesadilla I've ever had...for real! Chimichanga was unbelievable! Service was awesome. I found out it was the same owners as The Thirsty Beaver & it all made sense  Go here for sure for lunch this weekend if you want to try something new & pretty cheap too"}
{"text":"The Tipsy Burro reminds me of a foot stompin' dive hung over from a night of raunchy blues bands.  You know the type:  unmatched furniture, stuff hanging on the walls and a ceiling that's really cool when you're wasted, with that lingering smell of last night's tobacco and beer.  I've never visited past the lunch hour to know for myself; but, it seems like it to me.  Are they stepping up to become Charlotte's next Double Door Inn?  Damn, wouldn't that be nice.

So my impression is also supported by a limited menu, food served on an aluminum plate with an added layer of aluminum foil (just in case aliens are near), and good--but not great--grub.  I ordered a chimichanga mostly because I like the way it rolls of my tongue when I say it.  Adding the queso to the outside amped up the flavor and helped keep it moist.  It was filling, flavorful, and reasonably priced.  However, like almost everyone has Yelped, why are we paying for chips and salsa??  Dumb.

I say give 'em a whirl and make your own judgment.  I do hope they crank up the amps at night.  Then the menu makes more sense to me except the pay by the plate chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I can't begin to describe my love for this dive bar with fabulous and simple Mexican fare. Jukebox is free, but please play something awesome like Waylon or Johnny. 70's game shows on the bar tv's and everyone is a regular. I always get the nachos so really can't critique the entire menu. Just go. Enjoy. Become a little tipsy."}
{"text":"Chicken burrito had no flavor. We were so excited to see a restaurant in this location but food was a disappointment.  I hope they make some changes."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 2 stars because of the quality and bang for your buck! Most Mexican restaurants when you order an entree you get beans and rice with it. You also normally are given chips and salsa when you arrive! This place comes with NONE of that! My date and I order chips and salsa because it felt wrong not to enjoy them at a Mexican place and what we received was a joke! Smallest little ramekin of salsa I have ever seen, I mean seriously couldn't believe how small it was. Now my burrito was tasty. I like that you can put queso on your burrito for a dollar but the fact that it doesn't come with a side is a deal breaker for me! If I remember correctly the sides were $3 each. The decor is interesting, the service line is an old truck front. Mix match chairs and a garage feel. The best thing about this place was the friendly service. They are very new and maybe they will make adjustments but I was overall quite disappointed with the new restaurant."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and just go somewhere else. I paid almost $9 for two hard tacos that a 10 year old could have made better, black beans that clearly had just been poured out of a can, and the blandest Mexican rice. Atmosphere is cool, it's just your regular dive bar, service was good and friendly, but food is trash. Plus you have to pay for chips and salsa??? We paid like $5 for queso that was actually disgusting. Husband got the southwest burrito that another Yelper had recommended and it was pure sogginess. Everything is bland with zero seasoning... just go to Sabor if you want decent Tex-mex"}
{"text":"Fantastic sister business to the incomparable Thirsty Beaver!
This new venture offers food along with the usual dive bar drink menu. Choose from burritos, nachos, chimichangas and other low-key noshes while you sip your tall-boy Tecate.
Indoor and outdoor seating and they'll let you bring your pooch, too.
Come support this local gem!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. The wait staff is great. I have only tried the taco salad in a fresh tortilla shell. The salad was very fresh and tasty. The avocado ranch dressing was tummy. I like the funky decor of this place.  They have a very nice full bar as well. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Was really hoping this place was going to become a cool walkable neighborhood hangout, but unfortunately it hasn't. After going 4 times now, neither the food nor service has gotten much better. Have tried the margaritas, chicken nachos, quesadilla and tacos, and they are all just \"ok.\" The atmosphere is fun (free jukebox!), but the place could use a pool table or some additional games - I can't imagine the restaurant is full of folks eating very often. 

Most recently, we walked down to check out their 1-year anniversary they had been advertising on FB for a while. The mood was festive and they had some live music outside. Unfortunately, one bartender had a sour attitude that really spoiled the event for us. She was snippy with all guests she interacted with. 

Also, evidently to enjoy the music about 50 feet from the building you'd have to pay $25. This was really a joke since you could hear the music just as well from the back patio and decently nearly 1/2 mile back to the house. 

If you want better nachos/food at similar prices, I'd recommend Sabor or Lupies, and for similar games and drink selection, Elizabeth Billiards."}
{"text":"Upon my first visit on their opening night, I was immediately in love. One year later, the Burro is my favorite bar in Charlotte. Great food, cheap whiskey, cheaper beer, phenomenal bartenders and wait staff- this place is perfect. And the perfect amount of weird to boot. A true, one of a kind spot. This place even has a free juke box. Get the nachos."}
{"text":"DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER!!

FOOD- I had the Southwestern burrito! And it was AMAZING!!! Inside filled with potatoes, corn, black beans and more. You can add ( for a small fee) Chicken, Beef or Soy crumbles (WHICH IS GREAT NEWS FOR ALL MY VEGETARIAN FAMILY). I add a avocado in mine. The burrito was cut in half, at first I thought I was not gonna get full BUT I DID!! 

INSIDE- it's really nice inside from what you may expect. I like the bar set up. They have a outside eating area. By the bar there are 2 TV's. 

PARKING- lot is pretty big and much room."}
{"text":"Holy crap! This place.... So awesome! I had no idea what to expect after reading mixed reviews but I drive by it every day and had been wanting to try it. 

Upon first arriving - and trying to decide where to sit - the owner approached us and asked if we were ok. We wanted to sit outside but all tables were full so he quickly pulled up two chairs for us and sent a waitress out way. The waitstaff was amazing! So so friendly!

We had the margs of course, the did not disappoint. We also got The Tipsy Sizzler for food. And oh. My. God. It was so good! So fresh. And so flavorful! 

The vibe here is just perfect. It is a dive bar with an array of characters and I love that!

When we were leaving - walking across the parking lot - the owner ran out behind us to tell us goodbye. Seriously?! Killer service! 

I left saying I can't wait to go back! I will definitely make this a go to spot!"}
{"text":"Decided to test out the Tipsy Burrito with some friends after a pool day this past weekend. Definitely did not disappoint. Great drink selection and very moderately priced. We got a shredded chicken burrito, a ground beef burrito, and a beef chimichanga. I got the shredded chicken burrito and had a tough time polishing it off because it was so large and well packed. We also split the chips and queso, because you can never have enough cheese.

Service was average, nothing out-of-this-world, but no complaints. Very cool decor going with a more divey motif. Glad to have a good local spot in the neighborhood and will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Interesting interior design and theme,  true Tex-Mex. Food is below average with below average portions for the price. Also, Margaritas are too sweet for my liking.

With so many other Mexican food options around, it is hard for me to justify choosing this restaurant over others."}
{"text":"I like getting tipsy... and I like burros.  This place has it all.

Come here for the Mexican, stay for the food.  (see what I did there?)

But seriously though..."}
{"text":"Wasn't a huge fan. Overpriced ($17 for three tacos and a small ramekin of Guacamole), and pretty average food. People were very nice, so an extra star for that. Otherwise, less than stellar experience overall."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch for the first time on Saturday, 8-26-17, and OMG. We shared the nachos, asked for steak since it's not listed as an option on the menu, but the server was very accommodating. For our lunches, my husband ordered an assortment of tacos, he enjoyed all of them, but especially the pork and steak. I ordered the salad with steak and avocado ranch. SO good! Honestly, I could have gotten the salad sans dressing and instead used the salsa, but the avocado ranch definitely enhances the flavor of the salad. The steak was cooked perfectly, was tender, and had a lot of flavor. We came back tonight (Wednesday 8-30-17) and brought my Mom. She absolutely loved her chimichanga and she can't wait to enjoy the leftovers tomorrow for lunch! This place is definitely a hidden gem with the coolest interior decorations! Love the Tipsy Burro!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Had the fajitas and corn on the cob. It was Amazing!! Tons of flavor and such a awesome atmosphere. Wife is Vegetarian and im a carnivore so the menu was perfect for both of us. The service was amazing and accommodating to our large last minute group. We will defiantly be eating here again when in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, decor, and music but food not so much. Even the ice cream was stale with the churros! Other food kinda bland. Also way overpriced."}
{"text":"Meh. Below average TexMex: Flavors were bland, rice was dry and old, portions were decent. Inattentive service. Definitely a Very no frills kinda place."}
{"text":"From the people that brought you the Thirsty Beaver, the Tipsy Burro is a 2.0 version. The food is pretty good and they have good specials. Their signature margaritas are a little too sweet for my taste but I'm not going to complain too much. 

It's an upscale divey bar. One thing I found super off was the toilet seat in the men's bathroom without a door. Yikes!

The service was good and the atmosphere on a weekend lunch is relaxed and casual. I think it will be a completely different experience in the evenings. 

Nice joint."}
{"text":"From the creators of Thirsty Beaver comes a brand new foray into the dining scene here in Charlotte!

The original name was going to be The Even Thirstier Beaver Plus Tacos, Fajitas and Nachos but signage ordinances in Charlotte prevent such large signs - and thusly, The Tipsy Burro was birthed - I kid- I kid! 

The staff here is pretty much Rock and Roll. The waitresses are bad ass (in a good hot way) that could have come straight from a music video.

The décor is the same era as the Thirsty Beaver with a pretty freakin' amazing collection of retro beer lights above the bar (Billy Dee, Billy Dee). Lots of cool, kitschy details everywhere you look. The Cheryl Tiegs poster gave me a flashback to not only my childhood bedroom but the naughty poster section in Spencer's - you know the one. The piece de resistance is the truck cutout that serves as the window into the kitchen, definitely very boss. Or maybe it's the life size rabbit head - you decide.

The menu is straight forward - pick your dish - pick your protein - add whatever you feel like.

The Nachos with Chicken were decent. The Queso Dip was tasty. Probably the best thing on the menu is the steak sizzler. Plenty of food for two people. We were actually guided away from the tacos and to the Sizzler. 

I appreciate a Pabst Tall Boy or a Dos Equiis now and then but still like to see some local stuff (happy to see Sierra Nevada but not really local), but I guess it wouldn't be as divey with craft beer.

I am a fan to be sure - but our bill for two adults and two kids was a bit high - just felt like there should have been a little more value. Looks like they do have food and drink specials!

Only one entrance to the parking lot, so keep your eyes peeled or you'll shoot past it in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Ok I dropped in during the grand opening party for a quick bite- maybe not the best planning on my part? Still, I got a margarita and a chimichanga and you don't hear me complaining. I love the no-frills, casual atmosphere that you are familiar with if you ever go to Thirsty Beaver, and I'm happy to see it carried over here. And did I mention it was walking distance? Perfection. I will definitely be back on a less crowded night."}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is great. Mostly I love the food. I had a vegetarian chimichanga and was not disappointed. It was so amazing. They've done a great job!!!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure the owners are going for a \"dive bar\" atmosphere and boy have they achieved it! In a good way, of course. ;) 

The interior is fun, with lots of kitschy decorations, including a velvet Elvis or two. I loved how every table and chair was different. We opted to sit at the big wagon table at the back, in front of the big windows that overlooked Monroe Road/Lupie's Cafe. It's still on wheels and rolls back and forth a little bit. Yay for interactive seating options! 

The beer selection didn't live up to my admittedly high standards. I get the need to carry inexpensive PBR, Bud, etc. in a place like this but I would love to see even just one or two local sections. So many Charlotte breweries are canning now, why not add a Birdsong or NoDa option? Thankfully, the margaritas are awesome!!

The food was solid. We ordered a few stars including my special creation -- TNT fries with chili, queso and guac. Ultimate bar food and so good! The chips and salsa/queso/guac were all wonderful. The tacos were unimpressive compared to what you can get at other spots around town. Friends got burritos and they looked good. I loved all the fresh avocado! 

Last but not least, we loved all the servers. Justin, in particular, was tons of fun!"}
{"text":"Second visit just as satisfying as the first, The Tipsy Sizzler is fab and the Birdsong Jalapeño Ale is the icing on the cake! Could very well be our new go to place"}
{"text":"Huge fan of the Thirsty Beaver so was anxious to give it a try. Unfortunately I can't rave about any aspect in particular. Major issues that would probably cause me to not come back:
1) You have to pay for your chips and salsa. When it did arrive the salsa was in a small plastic ramekin enough for 4-5 scoops. There were 4 of us eating so it went quick.
2) Paid $9.00 ea for a patron margarita. It came in a small clear plastic cup maybe 10oz. Add a bunch of ice and I was done with my drink in 4 sips. If you're going to be a dive bar, then have dive bar  prices. For $9.00 a piece I would enjoy a nice sized margarita glass.

Again maybe just wrong expectation. Folks were nice, food was average and food for 4 was $60+ for lunch. With so many great choices I will opt for something different. I'll come back for a cold beer."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is just really WEIRD.   It's weird to have a biker bar feel to a Tex-Mex restaurant.   It's weird to have rocker chicks serving you Tex-Mex.   The decor is weird and cheaply done.   It's weird that they charge you for Chips and Salsa.....not to mention a small ass cup of maybe 4 scoops.  I thought it weird, also, that there are hardly ever any cars in the lot.....but now I know why.   It's just WEIRD.

From the moment we walked in...it felt uncomfortable.  There were 2 waitresses working the entire empty restaurant on a Saturday night.   Service was slow....orders were not placed correctly....food was sent back and remade.....yada yada.

The menu was EXTREMELY LIMITED...and a la carte.    No beans or rice come with your entree.   If You order a burrito....you get a burrito.....if you order a taco....you get a taco.  IF YOU ARE GONNA HAVE A LIMITED MENU.....the items on the menu better be dang good.   We had a taco and a burrito.   Both were somewhat flavorless and disappointing.  

Perhaps the best part of the entire experience was the diet coke and watching the other diners trying to figure out the weird place too.

I hate to say it....but I dont think this joint is gonna make it.   There are too many great mexican/taco/tex-mex places that give this one a run for its money.  

Nothing about it feels right."}
{"text":"This was a great find! Service was super friendly and fast, Margarita was well made and the options on the menu could please anyone! I'm a vegetarian and always get a bit weary when it comes to soy/tofu at restaurants. I had the. Southwestern salad with soy crumbles and it was cooked perfectly! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! So glad to have this place so close to home! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's not surprising that the crew behind the Thirsty Beaver would put together this gem. It's a bigger, cleaner, nicer version of the Beaver with food. The Beaver is great, but I like the Burro better. The food is no-frills and the drinks are as advertised. The eclectic mix of patrons really ties it all together. Just a great place to go and take a load off, drink some reasonably-priced booze, and shoot the shit in a very unlike Charlotte atmosphere."}
{"text":"I give the food 3 stars but the place itself I give a solid 4 1/2!!! Came here for Cinco De Mayo and it wasn't crawling with people which was awesome! So chill.  So easy to have a conversation without feeling like you have to shout.  Everyone was extremely nice and it's always great to see that amongst workers! 

My tacos, though, were not the best...but it's a bar so I get that! 

Great place to hang with friends, sit on the patio and have a drink or two (or 5) Hee hee!!"}
{"text":"Pretty low end \"TexMex\" food, limited beer selection but cheap. It's a inexpensive dive bar and you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I gave an extra star because the waitress was so nice, so accommodating, and extra helpful. She gave suggestions and was honest about her opinion of the menu. 

The restaurant has old decor, like from a different era. It was eccentric and bright, kind of cool.  There were tables and high tops and bar seating. 

You have to pay extra for chips and salsa, which I'm never a fan of. The chips came out hot and the salsa was ok. I ordered the Frito pie, which comes with chili. I got it on the side, which I'm glad of, because I did not like the flavor at all. I would suggest getting ground beef instead. The other food (tacos) were just ok. They came with beans when I asked for none, and just sort of underwhelming. 

The prices were great, I just feel like it wasn't as good as I had hoped. Maybe next time. I would order the Frito pie again with beef and avocado!!"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, delicious food, cold drinks and wonderful service. Had the pork nachos with queso. Split them with the hubs and we were both full. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I think I came on a bad night because my ground beef was a little burned. It was a little later in the evening so I would assume I received the bottom of the barrel meat. I ordered the taco plate. Rice and refried beans were delicious! It's a divey cool little place. Nothing is served on glassware so I wouldn't suggest a first date here. Vibes are cool. Definitely will be coming back. Very cheap !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Same owners as the Thirsty Beaver. Same cozy atmosphere as the Beave with a very hipster vibe. Food is great. Staff is great. Atmosphere is great. Try it out."}
{"text":"So, sorry for a two star review but I was truly disappointed with my experience at Tipsy.

First, Tipsy is not what I expected at all. I assumed, which I should not have, was that it was like Phat Burrito, however, it is so different.
Tipsy is a full service restaurant with a bar, specials, etc. I happened to go on Trivia Night and the place was packed.

Drinks were strong, but the food left nothing to be desired for. However, I did love the chips and salsa.
If you like Chili, avoid it. No flavor at all.

I am glad I checked it out, may be inclined to stop in for a Margarita, Chips & Salsa, but probably would pass on food again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. First time at the joint. The atmosphere is great, however, the food and timing of the food not so great. I ordered a burrito with pork + avocado. It took approx. 35-40 min to get our food (two in our party). The burrito filling consistency and texture was mush except for the tough chewy cubes of pork. There was a teaspoon portion of puréed avocado on one end. I would rank this burrito worst in town compared other restaurants in this category. The salsa lacked of flavor. Overall really disappointed. Will prob not return."}
{"text":"The food tastes good... but you don't get a lot of food for the price. Our party of r each got a burrito... but we're still hungry, so had to order nachos as well. None of us are full even after that.  It was $2.50 each for sodas!!! $60 for 4 people, and we aren't full....  we can go elsewhere, pay less, and leave full."}
