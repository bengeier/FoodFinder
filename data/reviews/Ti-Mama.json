{"text":"Ive only tried the veal and vegetable plate here and enjoyed it. Seems to be made with eggplant veal , carrots and spinach and other vegetables. Prices are great too. Problem is the owner doesnt seem to really know how to run a restaurant. He's a little slow.. Also on the menu it clearly says \"comes with plantain and salad\" and every time he seems surprised when I ask him to include the plantains as if its not supposed to be included. Overall great value for very decent food."}
{"text":"When a shop has steamy windows you can pretty much be assured something's cooking. You would also hope that it's good and not just steam from the dishwasher or a greenhouse. In this case it's not either. It's just a place where there is always friendly chatter at the counter and a simple Haitian menu being served. When I went they were so new they didn't even have Roti available and the chef had left for the day by chance. Regardless of this there were some hits and misses (again probably due to them starting up and the chef's admitted replacement).  I'll admit I am no expert in this cuisine, but know a thing about good bites, so here goes...  The veal stew, with its small cubes veal and slightly spicy sauce had a nice flavour. The chicken pieces in a Haitian style reddish brown sauce were tasty and cooked through. The chicken leg was enormous, but not cooked to a safe doneness (was not the normal chef on duty). The fried plantains where smashed into an odd shape but tasted all right nonetheless. The rice and beans were excellent, fragrant with visible sprigs of thyme and a staple for the plated dishes, as well as a bright as can be macaroni salad with finely chopped bell peppers. The salad with no dressing (not sure if that was on purpose) was plain but refreshing, and finally their pikliz (spicy Creole style coleslaw) was good on the side with just about everything.  The meals are well priced and they take plastic. Colourful menus have arrived since the black and white photocopied sheets they started with and what I used as a 'then' selection device.  Note: I would have had to give a 3 for the under cooked chicken or even less, but the reason was apologetically explained. I hope to try this cheerful place again with the menu in full swing."}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery from this place and the food came fast. The prices are ok. Now...if you like rice, well you'll get plenty of it. But i find the chicken pieces on the small side. It came with macaroni smothered in mayonnaise. I  would of liked a small green salad though... The sauce \"chienne\" was very oily. The riz collé had maybe five-eight red beans in it at most! The food was bland and needed much seasoning. Nothing like the creole food that I'm used to eat. The paté lacked filling and was on the small side as well. Would I order again? Most probably not."}
