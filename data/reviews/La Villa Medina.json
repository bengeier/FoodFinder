{"text":"I went to a small function that was catered by La Villa Medina.  The food was fresh, smelled delish, and there was a good, plentiful variety.  We had a variety of tasty salads, shwarma, falalfel, potatoes, rice, pitas, sauces,sweet deserts! This place is located in Cross Iron Mills Mall but if you are looking for someone to cater, they did an excellent job.  And so so many left overs.... had to sneak a couple plates home :)"}
{"text":"WORST falafel ever. The pita was ripped into small pieces and only held together by the patchwork like with the paper wrapping...meaning it falls apart as you pull the wrapper down to eat it. Most of the pita bits stuck to the wrapper so nothing holds the filling together. The falafel balls was the worst I've ever had. They we're literally soggy & mushy!  Never had mushy falafel ball before...makes me think it wasn't cooked. Usually a good one is crunchy on the outside. Awful garlic sauce too. Pickles & turnips were spears so they were too big vs usual julienne style. Could not finish eating the mess. It was quite gross. Stick with Jimmy's' or our fav Desert pita instead."}
{"text":"Worst shawarma I have ever eaten.  Small portion, cold, rubber pita.  This girl lace would benefit from loading on the veggies instead of leaving the wrap almost barren. Also heating up the pita would likely help the stale old thing that I got.  Cannot recommend, much better places in the city. My fault for ordering shawarma in the mall."}
{"text":"The best shawarma I have ever had!  The owner has great attitude. Food is fresh and ready. Staff is happy and willing. Just fantastic place!  The chicken and beef shwarma come with choice of sides all at a great price.   Just great experience"}
{"text":"The other day I was on a shopping rampage at Cross Iron Mills mall and it was time for a fuel pit-stop. I had seen pretty much all the places inside the food court before, except for La Villa Medina. It was a little place serving Lebanese fare, and of course, I was intrigued.   When it comes to their menu options, only one words sums this place up: WOW. They've got everything you could imagine when it comes to Middle Eastern fare. I'm talkin' falafels, grape leaves, pickled veggies, roasted potatoes, and the list goes on and on. And the prices are FANTASTIC!   A falafel (which is GIGANTIC) only costs $3.99. You can throw in some roasted potatoes, tzatziki sauce and a drink and you're at $6.99!   And let me just tell you: THE best falafel I have EVER had!!!   Great food, great prices, great feeling."}
{"text":"\"Let's go to La Villa Medina.\" Sounded like a fancy, exotic restaurant. Color me confused when we pulled up to the parking lot at Cross Iron Mills.   I'm glad to say that the food was worth the trick to get me to go to a giant mall. Fluffy soft pitas and roasted potatoes that I could eat for days, dolmades that weren't too sour and delicious falafel balls that were good even when reheated in a microwave. The tabouleh was also delicious and the Greek salad was loaded with fresh vegetables and a miniscule amount of Romaine lettuce. Unlike most food court Greek salads where it's one Kalamata olive, a giant tomato slice, a sea of red onions and a mountain of Romaine lettuce. The only downside was the couscous, which had a little too much acid in it and had to be mixed with the other food before it was palatable.  I was ready for a long siesta after this place. No dice; my companions wanted shoe shopping and bargain hunting. Still, I would risk a covert trip to the mall again for La Villa Medina's food. Great food, friendly staff, food court prices. And I'm always down for shoe shopping."}
{"text":"Mediterainian food served by chinese.   The food has more chinese flavour than mediterranian."}
{"text":"This little gem is tucked away in the food court at Cross Iron Mills; which may be a good thing because if it was closer to the city centre I may just eat there everyday.  I had a beef and lamb shwarma with potatoes smothered in a delicious garlic sauce and a coke for $7.99 .  The potatoe garlic sauce I wish was bottled and I could buy by the gallon.  It is one of the most delicious addons I have ever tasted.    The shwarma is huge , it is like a small baby , in napkins and wax paper ... and you are so thankful for this swaddling because you really want the reassurance that nothing will fall and go uneaten.  Staff is friendly and the vegetables that are added to your entree choice are always and ever so fresh.   There is also baklava at a dollar and  vegetarian options.    Something for everyone... the only thing it lacks...is that it is so far!"}
