{"text":"I am an avid sushi lover, so I was excited to try this restaurant.  I would definitely recommend making a reservation before coming as the restaurant has limited seating - it was already filled at 6 pm and bar seats (if you enjoy watching the chef) are in hot demand.  The ambiance of the restaurant really contributed to the entire experience - it's the small things like lighting (was just right, and not too dim) and noise level (I was able to talk comfortably throughout the night over the music and a full restaurant) which can make or break an experience.  It's definitely a great place to bring a date. 

Now, onto the food. I had the $50(!) omakase menu, which had 9 courses, and added the sushi special of the day, bonito. Our server presented each course to us and instructed us on how to eat each piece. My favourites of the night were definitely the bonito, madai (both from Japan!), and maguro. Each course was beautifully prepared with the utmost care; the chef and servers both ensured a seamless experience for guests. Needless to say, I'm excited to come back for another omakase menu!

The only reason why this didn't earn 5 stars for me is that parking is difficult to find near the restaurant.  I spent a good 10-15 minutes driving around the neighbourhood as most parking spots required a permit."}
{"text":"Very friendly place with amazing Sushi, and with a variety you would not find in any other places.  Sit by the bar and watch the chef preparing the food.  You will leave satisfied with both your tummy and eyes."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on a Saturday afternoon and was lucky enough to get a reservation the same day. Glad I did. Sat right at the bar so i can see all the prep being done. From first course to last this meal was satisfying. Seasonal menu so depending on when you go it will change. But all worth it. And the pace the food comes out is perfect. Staff is very passionate about the ingredients and it shows. Really enjoy the concept and the mood is relaxing and enjoyable. Will gladly and happily revisit this establishment anytime."}
{"text":"I tried skippa last night with my girlfriend who is Japanese and takes sushi seriously. In short we were definitely not disappointed. Skippa adheres to the fundamentals of a traditional sushi restaurant and serves phenomenal fish with minimal accompaniment, but also nails their less traditional side dishes with a combination on tastes that will truly impress. Their simmered squash might be the best vegetable dish I've eaten this year. Get the omakase for $45 for a full cross section of their menu and add a couple sides person for another 10$ or so. It's not a cheap meal, but when compared to other top quality sushi joints is quite reasonable.  I would recommend a reservation because it was busy when I was there on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"4.5 stars 

Chef Robinson was great! Sushi was fresh, authentic with a small touch of western flavour i.e. olive oil. We sat a the live-edge wooden table. (I can't tell you how much I adore that table, it's beautiful!) We ordered the omakase and 2 extra pcs of sushi - Wagyu and Uni. The Wagyu and Uni was delicious - you can't go wrong with them. Omakase is small (just 7 pcs) compared to other Jap Restaurants... so be sure to order the appetizers if you're going in with a empty stomach. Food is 4.0 as I find that the seaweed for the sushi roll didn't give me a \"crisp\" feel. I added the 0.5 for the ambience and service. I'd go back for the changing menu!"}
{"text":"My family eats sushi & sashimi regularly and we're always eager to try a new place.  We learned about Skippa from glowing newspaper reviews and immediately booked a table.  Being able to make a reservation is already a big plus over many sushi restaurants.  Skippa lived up to the reviews.  Everything we ordered was spectacular.  The oysters were among the best I have ever had.  The day's specials were Wagyu beef sushi and tuna belly.  Both were terrific.  We each chose a few items that appealed to us.  Nothing disappointed.  Items are priced for individual portions.  In other words, when you order a shrimp or tuna or oyster, you get a single piece.  Yet the prices of the individual pieces are more expensive than the 2 or 3 pieces you typically get at a sushi \"joint\".   I would suggest trying the tasting menu which, at $50, is VERY reasonably priced.  Bottom line - it's pricey compared to the uusual sushi \"joint\".   It was almost $200 for 4 not including alcohol, taxes or tip.  That's because this is high-end sushi and ashimi at its best.  Definitely worth every penny.  Unlike typical sushi \"joints\" Skippa has real style and a very comfortable atmosphere.  They have several booths that seat 4.  If you want privacy make sure to request a booth.  The remaining seating is either at a communal table for 8 or at a counter which works for couples but make conversation difficult if you are more than 2."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi for the price. Definitely would come here again. 

It's delightful to try sushi with a twist vs traditional sushi restaurants such as Yasu, Kaji, Zen, etc."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Maybe the best sushi Toronto has. Everything is so fresh and just awesome. If you're lucky enough to get a reso - jump on it !!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolute magic from start to finish. I've haven't enjoyed a meal this much in a long time. Skippa mixed loud, hectic ambiance, with incredible food and warmth from the staff and chef. Well done!"}
{"text":"Came here for their omakase. Price is decent for what you're getting. The quality of the fish and the way its prepared is very good. The chef is incredibly nice and friendly. Explained the difference between sushi found in north and south Japan. Everything was delicious, would recommend to anyone looking for a good omakase experience."}
{"text":"West coast sushi in TO?

Disclaimer: Never been to the west coast (seen plenty episodes of Bourdain). But this place sure looks like one in terms of gorgeous deco, chilled out yet prompt and friendly service, and perhaps price ?:) it has charming quirks -never been encouraged to eat sushi by hand or wasabi already rolled into it- perhaps attributable to its unpretentious attempt to do things a little different/authentic?

Does it work? Food is tasty and fresh, wow factor is mostly visual and prices are steep (Thank you Isshin Ramen for filling our bellies!). 

Repeat: Not immediately

Pro-tip: Great date spot"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. From the moment I walked through the doors I fell in love. The ambiance is upscale without an upscale menu price and the food is like something I've never experienced before.  

My husband and I sat up at the bar which was the place to be. We were able to watch the chef prep all of the meals, in addition to watching him scale and fillet a large fish right in front of our eyes. You can't get much fresher than that!

The meal was so perfectly executed, we started with a Amuse-bouche of some type of pickled Japanese radish that exploded with intense yet delicate flavours. Next up we had an oyster dish  that was topped with a lemon sorbet of sort...which was by far the best oyster I've ever had, and that says a lot considering I lived on the East Coast of Canada for 3 years. 

Following this, we had several pieces of fresh sushi --- all sourced directly from Japan. 

We finished up the dinner portion with Wagyu beef and Uni . Shall I say more?

For dessert we had one dish of coconut milk sorbet and an oat ice-cream topped with local blueberries... words cannot describe how great this was. The ice cream is even made in house. 

One really awesome thing about this place is that you are told to eat the sushi with your hands? Apparently Sushi was developed in Japan as finger food and is traditionally eaten with your hands. Also, all of the items that aren't shipped directly from Japan are locally sourced, + organic. 

If you haven't already been here... you must go."}
{"text":"4.5 stars! 

Skippa is a new Japanese restaurant with a focus on fresh, local produce and Ocean-Wise seafood. Chef Robinson trained under Kaji-san of the esteemed Sushi Kaji. Skippa isn't like Kaji, Shoushin, Zen, etc. But it's not trying to be!

Chef Robinson's skills shine through in the simple but important things -- great sushi rice, painstaking effort to source awesome ingredients, and an personable, approachable attitude to omakase. For $38-$50, you get a selection of the fish of the day, some of the best edamame you will ever eat, and a handroll. 

The Okunumatsu sake goes great with the sushi here by the way! 

They're currently only at 4.5 stars because they've recently opened and they are still hammering out some details of the service, but I'm sure when I visit again they will continue to improve!"}
{"text":"Nice intimate out of the way place. 

I haven't been to Japan yet but i imagine this is what places there are like. 

Most of the seating is at the bar. An amazing live edge table in the center and some booths off to the side.   Low lighting, cool music. Great ambience 

I went with the Omakase menu which was one of everything except the wagyu beef, which i ordered separately. 

Also had Nest Lager to drink. A great beer. Will definitely see if i can get some for home. 

Everything was amazing although portion size to cost was a little high. My favourite was the golden eye  sea bream from New Zealand. 

Sushi was prepared slightly different than what i am used to. I think it is the rice they use? 

One issue was my wife did not order the omakase and did not get what she ordered until close to the end, after I had already eaten most if my food. Not nice."}
{"text":"Really good. Authentic without being boring. Carefully executed dishes. Quality selected local ingredients. The chef tells me he visits the farms for his ingredients. Really creative japanese food. If you are looking for cheap sushi big quantity this is not the place. You come to skippa for fresh creative japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"Arrived at a half empty restaurant (it remained like that for the 3 hours dinner lasted)  and made the mistake of ordering their version of the Omakase - the waiter suggested we add some sides to (which we thought was odd).  Unlike a traditional Omakase where there is a lot of interaction with the chef and the courses get progressively heavier we never saw the chef once and dishes arrived in no particular order with LONGGGG ( at times over half an hour) between courses.  8 courses took almost 3 hours to serve - when we made the booking we were reminded of a 2 hour seating limit on multiple occasions. 

The food overall was well executed but definitely not worth the wait, at no point during the meal were we not hungry . Some courses didnt come out at the same time, leaving people staring at one serving, hoping their food arrived soon.  

When the waitress finally arrived with the last course (mediocre tamago) we immediately asked her for the bill and asked her if 3 hrs was normal for the Omakase.  She seemed surprised that we had been there that long and sent over another member of the wait staff who identified herself as the manager.  We voiced our dissatisfaction at the long wait and she said she would talk to the owner / chef before bringing us our bill.  I guess the owner didnt think our experience was an issue that needed to be addresses as no concession was made on the bill (an offer to stay EVEN longer to have dessert was suggested, which we declined) . The manager suggested we return another time and she would ensure we had a better experience, I mentioned comping part of our bill would have been a start and she seemed surprised and responded with \"is that something you would expect\" . I pointed out that when someone claims to talk escalate an issue to the owner some sort of compensation is expected, which was received with a blank stare."}
{"text":"Dang was i surprised at their omakase. Their fish was so fresh and tasty. Loved the overall ambiance of this restaurant. For 50 dollars omakase- pretty good deal id say. Loved every bite. The oyster was so delicious as well! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place so give this place a try and glad I did - yummy. :)

Reservation is recommended and  you need to do this via email and I believe it's the only way. I am ok with it since I have to use email everyday anyway. If you have any allergy or food restriction, just let them know also. The service are very friendly in my opinion.

We reserved seating at the Sushi Bar (6 seats) and I also recommend Sushi Bar seatings as well if you are planning to eat sushi - you also get to see the chef make your sushi in front of you. Based on my understanding, there are 3 timeslots for Sushi bar seating: 5:30, 7:30, and 9:30 with 2 hours each. So if this is your first time trying this restaurant like me, get the Sushi bar for the best experience and you also get to chat with the chef at the same time and ask him questions directly about the food!

We ordered the Omakase menu for $45, and I think it's what you should go for because you don't need to think about what to order. I didn't keep count, I think I get about about 6 pieces of sushi, one handroll, a sashimi dish (2 pieces), and an appetitzer. The fish are very fresh and tasty(yummy), and looks like using real wasabi. At least for the sashimi, I see the chef grated something that looks like wasabi root. As for the Sushi, not sure what wasabi is used but each sushi piece are tasty. The most memorable item for me is the handroll, the nori seaweed used is very crunchy and with very strong seaweed aroma/tastes, very like the one I tried in Zen or Shoushin. :) You gotta eat this immediately (I didn't even bother taking any pic for this handroll because I want it as crunchy as possible). And when you lightly (very lightly) dipped the end of the handroll into their homemade soy sauce before taking each byte, it's very yummy! My friend and I cannot resist and ordered another one at the end... lol!

I don't think think the Omakase portion would fill my tummy so I also ordered two more appetizers to share with my wife: Taro root with Wagyu tallow, and Maitake Salada. Both are good, For the Taro one, I really loved the sauce and the tallow, it's a really good combination and goes very well with the Taro. As for the Maitake Salada, the mushroom are organic and it is roasted so it has a very strong mushroom flavor. I find this dish is abit on the salty side but it is still very good! If I go again next time, I probably will get the Taro again - cheaper and yummier. :)

And we also tried the Wagyu beef sushi, this I would have to say it's the weakest item I have tried. It's not bad overall but for $10/piece, I would use that budget to repeat the handroll a third time (it's just me.. lol). :)

Overall, the experience is a pleasant one, good sushi, friendly service. But too bad it's  located in downtown, it is quite a long travel for me... But if I am in the area again, I will go back for sure ! Thank you chef for the yummy dinner!"}
{"text":"Sampled most of the sushi pieces on our visit.
Decor and service are great. Immediately intrigued by the above average selection of nigiri on hand. I would describe Skippa as a place that aims to respect tradition while moving forward at the same time. The flavour combination are clearly thought out and a reflection of the chef's passion and innovation. 

That being said the sushi itself was under whelming. The slices are quite thin making each piece feel a bit rice heavy and overall the balance was not to my liking. The condiments such as the tomato and basil on the salmon I found interesting though somewhat overwhelming primarily because the fish is thin but also because it's lacks the depth of flavour that great sushi has. The fish was never at the fore ground I would notice the uniqueness of the condiment and then mostly be tasting the rice. The grade of seafood seemed to be a slight miss. I've had sweeter more flavourful scallops at other places in the city, same goes for the salmon and I had similar thoughts for most of the pieces. The oyster was delicious.  

I found the rice not quite sweet enough and seafood just a bit too thin. Slightly heavy handed on the wasabi and the quantity of wasabi which did not seem to properly vary depending on the type of nigiri. 

I hope this this new restaurant will do well and the chef's effort is evident, however I will give it sometime before returning."}
{"text":"Easily the best omakase experience in the City!   Ian is a world class talent and has an unwavering pursuit of the best quality."}
{"text":"Date night with my SO.... after an amazing experience at JaBistro I was hoping that Skippa would compare, it's a local sushi bar with a small focused menu and really fresh sushi. We really liked the progression of bites and the whole \"no soy for this piece / yes, you soy for this one\" I don't know anything about Sake beyond that i like it cold vs hot. I always ask the server to choose and she chose a delicious one (wish I'd snapped a shot so that I might be able to recall it) the non-sushi items were tasty but it's the sushi that we would come back for. Solid spot but for the $$$ I would hit JaBistro again first."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday dinner and the food was amazing! The fish was all high quality and beautifully presented, reminding me why the cheap sushi we sometimes get at other places is cheap. You definitely get what you pay for.

We had the Omikaze which was the perfect amount for me, but my partner needed to order a few extra pieces to be satisfied. I did have a couple of the oysters though, which were fantastic. I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Nice unique urban restaurant experience. Chef is into his food and details. If you sit st the bar near him, he'll tell you lots about the food. It's a well run machine where the staff are into this venture. Love these smaller businesses. 

The food is carefully prepared. The fish is super fresh. In fact, the make their own soya sauce and their wasabi is fresh! It makes such a difference. Of course, one has to pay for these extras in the price but it's well worth it. Apps were also great: very creative with the veggies.

Cool space, not over the top like Bay Street though"}
{"text":"Service was good. It's expensive but worth a try. The omakase was ok for the price. The sushi was fresh. Sea bream was excellent"}
{"text":"The reviews for this restaurant are crazy high. It's an alright place and I'm glad I came to check it out (my bf and I went to the restaurant where the owner used to work), though I came with a party of 4 and I think we all agreed that this was going to be the one and only time we'd eat here. 

I like the concept of the restaurant; that it's almost like an introductory way for non-omakase eaters to enjoy nigiri and sashimi without being overwhelmed by other more traditional and high-end spots. The ambience is a lot more relaxed, everyone looks like they're having a good time and chatting like how they normally would, which in a regular omakase restaurant I might feel a bit awkward to do due to the silence and seriousness of it all. Also a thumbs up to the waiters and waitresses, they were cool and attentive.

Downside of this place is that I don't feel the food itself is that outstanding for the price it's being sold at. I loved the shishito peppers (of all things), and everything else was unfortunately a bit lack lustre (we essentially ordered the entire menu). I was most disappointed by the wagyu beef - I think the sauce on it reminded me of chinese beef ribs my mom would cook at home growing up..."}
{"text":"Beautiful, perfect, amazing... and I'm just getting started. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Far and away best sushi I have had in Toronto, this was the best meal I have had since early 2016 (thanks Yelp for helping me keep specific records of such things). Truly remarkable, memorable food and experience. The space is modern and warm, with Japanese accents and an organic feeling thanks to the rambling polished wood table. This is a great date spot, energetic without being overly loud - we were easily able hear each other, and the lighting is good. We came to celebrate a special occasion, and sat at the bar in front of Chef Ian Robinson. Ian is mesmerizing to watch, deft and exacting in his preparation of sushi. He guided us through the menu - we ordered almost everything on it - and advised us as to which pieces of sushi required soy sauce, and which did not. Every bite was clean, rich, perfect. The sushi rice is incredible - light, sweet, perfect temperature and texture.The fish is fresh as can be, and painstakingly prepared.The menu changes daily, but I strongly recommend the oysters, the shishito peppers, the kabocha, hotate (scallop), and the wagyu. Beyond simple recommendations, I firmly demand that you order the madai (seabream), I had seconds of that one - wonderful texture, a little sweet, a little salty, ocean-y clean, delicious. Thanks to an order mixup, I also got a chance to try off menu Hokkaido uni, such a special treat! I was initially bummed that they don't offer cocktails, but sake and green tea were both lovely with the meal. We wrapped up with local peach sorbet, and scotch from a bottle signed by Ian's old boss, Chef Kaji. It does not get any better than this. Insanely good. A little pricey, but we will be back for sure. Love!!!"}
{"text":"An interesting experience for me as I've never been to a restaurant that does omakase. At 50 dollars I was worried it would be too much food so I opted for a couple of choices from the individual items on the menu. My husband went for the omakase and it turned out to be small portions of food after all. Although he said he really enjoyed his, it came one piece at a time. I watched him eat each one and waited for mine to come. The waiter thought I only ordered one roll which arrived at the end of the omakase. By then I was starving lol. Thank goodness for the complimentary tea! We ordered a couple more things after that because we both were still kinda hungry. But by then it was getting late. 
The atmosphere was really nice, though. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Located on Harbord, east of Ossington. The place has a great ambiance and attentive service. I couldn't get over how cute the chopstick holders were. 

Came here without a reservation, and the server had to check in to see if we could be seated at the communal table. Tip #1: make a reservation. However, as we were seated, it was never busy per se, and there were lots of empty seats.

We both ordered an omakase set each ($38), shared a smoked mackerel, and splurged on a piece uni each ($18). The sushi was fresh and delicious. The quality was exceptional! It was legitimately a melt in your mouth experience.

Following our meal we asked for our bill and it was more expensive than we had anticipated. Considering that in Toronto Life (where I first found this resto recommendation) listed it as $$. Tip #2: trust Yelp's dollar sign listing on each establishment as opposed to Toronto Life. 

We left satisfied, however my boyfriend left hungry. We were comparing it to our experience at Yasu, and came to the conclusion that the quality at Yasu was just as amazing, but for the price of the Omakase you would get more pieces and left full."}
{"text":"Have known the owner, Ian, since grade 3 and was so excited to check out his restaurant!  Fantastic experience, cozy atmosphere, very friendly staff!  Incredible food and beautifully executed.
Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here over the holidays. Enjoyed the ambiance and food and will probably go back! 

Pros:
-Nice ambiance, especially cozy in the booths. (Also, a small restaurant - make a reservation.)
-Amazing food and flavours! We had the omakase plus the kabocha and tai ochazuke. Some really unique dishes. For example, the kabocha dish was a lightly-fried ball of mashed squash in a delicious broth. The daily appetizer included fish, leeks, and pomegranate seeds. Overall, fish seemed to be of high quality.
-Good drink options, including beers, wines by the glass, and sake.

Cons:
-Seemed to be a lot of mackerel and sea bream on the menu. I understand the menu is likely based on what's fresh but since most of the fish probably came from outside of the city anyway, why not include another type of tuna, or some salmon? 
-Some dishes were quite pricey for portion size. 
-One of the nigiri pieces had a super-chewy bit on the end which wasn't very nice (and shouldn't be the case at this price point.)
-We had different servers throughout the evening, bringing out the omakase courses. Not a big deal but annoying when we wanted to order another drink etc. (it wasn't clear if we should try to flag down our original server, or order from someone else).

Other
-We ordered omakase and 2 side dishes which was just right - server recommended ordering omakase plus an additional 3 or 4, so I'd suggest ordering a couple and seeing how you feel. 
-Be aware there doesn't seem to be much of a cost-savings for choosing the omakase. If I went back I'd order it again, since it's nice to try many different things, but it isn't really a 'deal'."}
{"text":"Three of us sat at the bar, which was a very fun experience because we got to interact with the chefs and see what other people ordered so we could get the same if it looked good.  The menu changes daily so I won't list what we had. We tried pretty much everything on the menu and shared the vegetables.  The sushi was really good and very fresh.  The rice didn't feel heavy like some sushi places.  Wagyu was really good!  I thought it was a bit expensive...about $100 per person with one glass of wine each and no dessert.  I would go back, but more for special occasions."}
{"text":"Decided to check Skippa out because I heard about the affordable $45 omakase deal on BlogTO. 

For some reason,? I thought the omakase would be enough food but I was definitely left hungry after the experience. For two people you would need to order 2-3 side dishes along with the omakase. That being said, the bill came out to be more expensive than I had prepared to pay that night. 

The food was very standard. The ingredients they used were fresh but none of the dishes stood out flavor-wise?. 

Overall, not super impressed with Skippa. Personally, I would rather drop $110/pp at Yasu and get a ?better quality omakase that can fill me up."}
{"text":"Great ambiance very hip, food is ok. 
The fish is fresh for the omakase, i wish we werent rush because the sushi kept on coming even though we didnt finish the first one yet since he ordered apps too. Noticed they paired us up with a 3 top that ordered the same omakase. 


Omakase $45 today was 1 1x1eggplant( dont get fooled about the word appetizer, more like an amuse bouche) 1 bowl of soup, 6nigiri, 1 handroll, tamago
- people go for this its worth trying once but thats it wont really worth coming back for nothing stood out. 

Fish that was served 2 kinds of seabream, manguro, amberjack, mackerel, bonito. 

Maitaki salad could be skipped roasted mushrooms with red cabbage, and miso. Mediocre $13.5

Had the special seabream collar which was good, not your typical kama, this was soft and succulent almost like a steamed fish. $7

Damage for 2 with tip, $150. Very expensive not really full too. Wish the appetizer they serve are more filling. Even though they recommended 3-4 apps, they wont really fill you up. Pickles, edamame,oysters,squash....."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for our 1 year anniversary and while the wait staff were friendly, we were kept waiting so long between each dish that we actually left feeling really frustrated. Each nigiri piece would take around 15 mins to come out. The food wasn't anything spectacular or special either. Mediocre with an expensive price tag and we left still feeling hungry after a $240 bill. If you want good omakase, I would recommend yasu or Kaji instead."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! It is a very cozy restaurant with a great selection of both food and drinks. The only thing that you need to be cautious about is that even though the menu items appear cheap, the bill adds up really quickly! Make sure to make a reservation to get the bar view of chef Robinson making the sushi. Will definitely be coming back!

Full Omakase (4.5/5)
Wagyu sushi (5/5)
Shishito peppers (4/5)
Mushroom Salad (5/5)"}
{"text":"I brought my girlfriend here for a birthday dinner after reading Blog TO's review. We both asked for the omakase menu, and ordered a few appetizers to start: six oysters, the eggplant appetizer, and a wagyu dish that resembled a croquette. 

All of this, together with a bottle of wine was $240. 

While the food was fresh and some of the dishes were exceptional in flavour, others were quite muted and didn't really have very much flavour at all. As well, the courses were single pieces of nigiri, and there were approximately six courses. So in literal terms, you're getting six pieces of nigiri/sushi for dinner. 

I found that a bottle of wine split between two was way too much for the amount of food; we had to either order significantly more food, or go elsewhere. We opted for the latter and finished the night at Bar Isabel. 

Overall, the experience was nice but for the price, i'd much prefer Ja Bistro or Miku."}
{"text":"My 1st time at Skippa & we sat at the sushi Bar. The seating is tight with bar stools & no back rest...probably the only negative for me but it was worth it to watch all the preparation & to be able to converse with the chef/owner Ian. Great guy! 

We had the Trust Skippa. Definitely enough to eat. Everything was amazing with the exception of Grilled black maitako mushrooms which were too salty. Also the pickled carrots, zucchini were just ok...complimentary so can't complain. Loved the caraquette oysters with yuzu from NB! All the sushi was just melt in your mouth delicious! The 2 desserts were yummy as well! 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Probably my and my girlfriend's first true omakase experience. Chef Ian Robinson and team took very good care of us and we had a great experience on our 1 year anniversary. Loved the firefly squid, the horse mackerel, the ice cream, the drinks, and all the delicious bites in between. All courses were beautifully composed and explained to us. Seafood tasted fresh and thoughtfully incorporated where used. We had nest beer and various sake---we only regret not having tried the matcha umeshu (which we found out we really like, at another restaurant). The dining space itself is beautiful, clean, and stylish with an L shaped bar and a live edge table as well. Though overall probably one of my more expensive meals, I wouldn't hesitate to come back for a special occasion. A flawless and memorable experience for us."}
{"text":"Wasn't overly impressed with this place.

After having incredible omakase at places like Zen and Yasu, I had quite high expectations. 

The restaurant itself and the service were great, but the food left a lot to be desired. Nothing was bad, but also did not make me say wow as past omakase's have. I feel like this was just like going to an average sushi place and getting a sushi boat. Because each piece lacked in flavour it was hard to justify the bill. For example, you woud add a piece of uni on for $15, yet the taste was bland and not rich as I would expect at such a price point. For the same price you can eat far superior omakase - I highly recommend Yasu. We left Yasu full and it was such an incredible meal, and only costs slightly more.

Skippa was a bit of a disappointment to say the least. For such a high priced meal the quality of the food could not justify the bills, thus I would sadly pass on Skippa go elsewhere."}
{"text":"...\"Perched at the L-shaped bar, I observed Chef Ian  Robinson closely as I perused the small menu. He was hypnotizing to watch--deft in his movement and precise in his technique. You'd never know he had no formal culinary training (he apprenticed at Sushi Kaji).

The menu (complete with an old-school library date stamp) presented a selection of locally-sourced vegetable sides, sushi and sashimi. All items were offered à la carte (ranging in price from $4 to $10) or as omakase (chef's choice). For the night I was there, the omakase was priced at $45 and included onozi, Japanese new year soup, and eight pieces of sushi.

Let me tell you...the Japanese new year soup was not an impressive way to steer the ship out of the harbour. Limp vegetables floated in a bland miso broth. C'etait dégoutant....\""}
