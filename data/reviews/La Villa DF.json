{"text":"Saw a service  worker dipping in a bag of tortilla chip she didn't  wash her hands and didn't  wear gloves. For a 6 oz cup two dollars  plus tax."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic cheap tacos. Had 1 chicken, 1 beef head, and one steak taco. All only $1.50 (all tasted great but I wouldn't get the chicken one again cause it was a bit bland and mushy) the real treat ended up being the horchata. (Best horchata I've had in a long time) and they only charge $1 for a refill on a large (well worth the extra buck for another delicious horchata) I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars! The real deal. Pastor, buche, cabeza, the list goes on. Great tacos. If I wasn't so full, I'd order a lengua torta to take home!"}
{"text":"I expected a regular Mexican food place and was pleasantly surprised. I had to order something I've never had but it was very good!! I wouldn't know if its authentic but it seems like it!"}
{"text":"Their tacos de tripa are to die for! I've been to other places and the tripa is either hard or crunchy, but not here! Their quesadillas are pretty bomb too! The employees have great customer service. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent prices and quality, authentic food. A lot of flavor in both their red and green sauces (also a nice kick of heat). 
Tacos are simple, inexpensive and really good. Pastor stands out for me. 
Their quesadillas are huge! Loaded with cheese, it's super gooey and filling. 
People are nice too. Solid family restaurant. Give it a try."}
{"text":"The quesadillas here are amazing! Authentic mexican food. Reminds me of the mexican dishes I used to find in a mexican area in New York City. No other mexican spot in Arizona makes dishes like they do here. I recommend this place for sure. Great food that's reasonably priced. The tostadas are pretty good as well but if you come here you have to try a quesadilla. I want to try a platano maduro here one day. I seen it on the menu and it's not usually something you'd see on a mexican menu. I'm Dominican so I was glad to see it. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Tasty, filling, and cheap! What more could you ask for from this authentic style Mexican place in a strip mall off the highway. 

The beverages were very large indeed and the horchata was delicious. We chased our lunches with the fried plantain dessert which was satisfyingly delicious. 

While I wouldn't rate this place on atmosphere, the staff was friendly and efficient and the bathrooms were clean. When you're looking for good tacos, do you really need more than that?"}
{"text":"This place is a nice place to get a quick bite. It's ok the newer side, so it's very clean and the service is good. The staff is friendly and the food comes out fairly quickly. I had the steak quesadilla, which I've never experienced one like this before. It was on large crispy corn tortilla filled with cheese, meat, sour cream and lettuce. The salsas/hot sauce were very spicy and flavorful! Hubby had one of the tortas and it was packed with flavor and meat served with classic crispy crinkle cut fries.  I had a side of rice, but was whatever about it. I ordered a steak taco and was impressed with the simplicity and taste. Goes perfectly with the spicy hot sauce! I will be back soon."}
{"text":"So glad that they finally opened their new location! For months I've been enjoying the terrific huaraches, tacos, alambres, and other Distrito Federal (DF) style fare that they've been serving at their old location and this new place is more easily accessible and has better parking. And the service is just as friendly and the food just as tasty and inexpensive as in their older location. Looking forward to many, many repeat visits here. (Note: for now they accept cash only; eventually the option to pay by card will be available as well.)"}
{"text":"The Huarache was so beautiful I wanted to wear it. Vegetarian with mushrooms. Good salsa. Good chips. what more do yo need in this life?"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem of a restaurant. We enjoyed a great lunch here. Authentic Mexican cuisine, friendly service, and come everyday prices. We are visiting Phoenix and will seek out this place again. No alcohol served here, which keeps the place family friendly and prices low."}
{"text":"The only review you need to pay attention to is from a born and raised Mexico City girl! This place brings back so many good memories from my dear Mexico. Of course nothing is going to be close to the real thing but this place comes very close to it. The staff is super friendly, the portions are good and so it's the price. Every time I come here I don't get disappointed."}
{"text":"My and my husbands family are from Mexico City. So we grew up with the same foods that is offered here. I am happy to have this AUTHENTIC MEXICAN food restaurant nearby! Even more ecstatic that the food truly represents the taste and feel of Mexico City. Prices are good and the portion sizes are huge! AND the variety of food is enjoyable. I am definitely a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Delicious Authentic Mexican food! The service was great- staff was super friendly and attentive.I had the Pambazo and Fried Platano Dessert was yummy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is still fairly new, and offers an extensive list of dishes from Mexico City. We came to grab an early dinner due to the positive Yelp reviews, and the experience was mixed but enough to bring me back for future visits. Upon entering, the sizable interior encompassed a long vertical open kitchen to accompany a red on brown colored décor. There were also several TVs and rows of tables casually arranged. 
 
The Cabeza and Chicharrón Tacos ($1.50 each) came with minced beef head and pork rinds served on double-decked corn tortillas that held up nicely. Both tacos were nicely seasoned to accompany the sweetness of the corn tortillas, onions, cilantros, and picked red onions. In particular, the fatty Cabeza was delicious, nicely seasoned and great meaty flavor stemming from the fat. On the other hand, the Chicharrón was partially burnt, with flavors and textures undistinguishable. Not sure what I was eating, but definitely avoid the Chicharrón.

The Mexicana Torta ($9.99) was made with large strips of tender marinated chicken, jalapeños, and refried beans sandwiched in-between soft sturdy telera. I loved the soft sweet telera roll and the marinated chicken. Unfortunately, the sandwich was missing grilled onions, tomato, and avocado, causing Santi to return it for another one. Fortunately, they were able to fix the problem quickly, but I wished they could have remake the entire sandwich instead of given us the one that was partially eaten. The Torta tasted a lot better once the missing ingredients were added. For the price, I wished the meat and fillings were more stacked.

The Lengua Huarache ($7.50) was the best dish of the meal. It came with a thick masa layered with refried beans, cubed beef tongue, lettuce, Mexican white cheese, and sour cream. I wished the grilled masa could come with some crispy edges to add texture, but it was soft, flavorful, and easy to cut into. The beans nicely corroborated with the substantive lengua and corn masa, and the rest of the toppings added a hint of sweet, sour, and bright flavors. The lengua was tender, chunky, plentiful, but could be cut into bigger pieces. It was delicious, not greasy, and the biggest Harache I have seen to date.

They were out of several dessert items, so we ordered the Churro de Canela ($2.50) to complete our meal. Arrived piping hot fresh, the two long strips of Churro were coated with cinnamon and sugar. Albeit a few inconsistencies in the fried dough, the Churros were tasty, not greasy, and coupled nicely with the side of strawberry jam. Not as good as the ones from Mr. Churro, but the mix of crunch soft sugary bites provided a nice finishing touch.

The atmosphere was modest, welcoming, and family and group friendly. Interested diners should expect friendly, knowledgeable, and down to earth service. I was somewhat disappointed in the lack of heat in these dishes, but the red and green sauces were able to make up for the missing flavors. Using Guisado as a case in point, I thought the food could be so much better if they could just put a little more into these dishes to distinguish the cuisine from all others. For example, the complimentary chips should be served warm and lightly salted, and the meat could be served in bigger pieces to go along with more striking flavors of Mexico City. 2.5 stars for the overall dining experience. I find their food to be promising, and would be interested in returning to try their Sopes, Alambre, Pancita, Pork Leg Torta, Fried Plantains, and Chocoflan."}
{"text":"On a quest for the best torta in Phoenix, I came here looking for it but left enjoying another dish instead.

I came during non-peak hours and noticed a number of families enjoying their meals. I thought this was a good sign and hope this would be \"the place.\" 

My eyes directed me to the Tortas on the menu. With twelve different types, I knew this was another good sign. I picked the \"Mexicana\" with Chicken Fajita $9.99 (beef or chicken fajita, cooked with tomato, onion, jalapeños, melted chicken, avocado and refried buns on the top bun) minus the melted cheese and mayo. The choice of chips, french fries or salad came with my torta. My excitement grew as I waited patiently for my food to arrive. Within ten minutes, I had my freshly made torta with a side salad. From past negative experiences, I made sure to peel back my bun to make sure all the ingredients were in place. Unfortunately, they forgot my avocado and cooked tomatoes and onions. Whomp whomp whomp. The well seasoned strips of chicken was cut into generous pieces yet didn't have any vegetables to balance the torta. I added the pickled onions to give it a punch of flavor. The telera (bun) was soft which I prefer compared to the crusty bolillo. I also thought this was a little bit over priced for a torta. Maybe it's just me??

The bright spot came when I tried the Huaraches with Lengua (Beef Tongue) $7.50. The Huaraches (translated as \"sandal\" in Spanish) was made with masa and beans and deep fried/pan fried in a shape of a sandal and topped off with meat, veggies and cheese. Their lengua was cut into cube sized pieces and spread throughout the dough. I added the red sauce to each bite for the extra spice factor. Great choice and highly recommended!

To polish off the meal, I ordered the Churro de Canela $2.50 (fried dough rolled in sugar and cinnamon) with a side of strawberry jam. The two churros were piping hot and crispy but were inconsistent in the middle. It wasn't a grease sponge but rather light and crunchy. 

They served a complimentary side of picked red onions, chips and two salsas. Warning: red is waaaay hotter than the green.

The interior had no frills and it was nice to watch the cooks behind the glass window preparing our meals. The staff was kind and knowledgable of the extensive menu. They also offer Taco Tuesday $1.25 each (compared to $1.50 regularly). 

This business opened it's doors ten months ago and the one thing I really appreciated was the staff's EFFORT to make us feel at home. IMO, effort is trying and comes from the heart and not an afterthought. 

Overall, not the best and the search continues."}
{"text":"Like many authentic Taqueria places in Houston, this excellent establishment in a Phoenix strip mall clearly conveys you'll have a tasty meal as soon as you walk through the front doors and spy the all-Spanish signs.

Today I came here for a work lunch and I was fortunate to have my co-worker buddy with me who speaks good Spanish. Therefore, I was the only person in the entire restaurant that didn't speak fluently.

We both ordered the tacos. I got two Pastor and one Longaniza (Mexican dry sausage) which had nice depth of flavor. The real knockout was their salsa roja and salsa verde, each of which brought a nice high burn heat but good flavor too. They also have the authentic pickled onions with Habanero which presents hot, sour and fruity.

The tacos are small so I added on a side of rice and refried beans. The rice was just OK - more of an afterthought but the refried beans were lighter and more wet and the sprinkling of Cotija cheese is a nice touch. The service is prompt and it wasn't too busy today. This is a place worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"Was very excited to find this place as the food seemed pretty authentic.The pastor seemed more like a chile colorado than authentic pastor and the carne asada didn't taste like real asada but rather the kind you get at most chains out here in Arizona. In general the food was under seasoned - it also took a very long time to get our order even though we were the only ones there at the time. Our waitress was very nice, though - hopefully they tweak a couple of things and are successful. :)"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexico City food! Good quality ingredients, great recipes. We loved the quesadilla de chicharrón and the wide variety of tacos, including cabeza and other delicacies."}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable, made to order tacos. $4.99 for 4 tacos or in my case, $4.99 for two tacos, rice, and beans. WHOOP WHOOP I WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"$1.50 tacos :) 

I was expecting this place to be one of the order to go type places but its actually a pretty nice place to sit and eat. Once you sit, they give you a menu with chips, salsa, and some pickled spicy onions. We were hungry and craving some \"weird\" food so we ordered an array of food. Tacos (Pastor, Beef Head, and Beef Tongue), pig hooves torta, and posole soup. The tacos were small, but tasty. I actually was pretty content with 3 tacos. My favorite was the pastor. Ive never had pig feet torta but it actually wasn't too bad. It kind of tasted like beef tendon. Lastly, the posole soup was not bad. 

Overall, if you looking for out of the ordinary menu items, come here. I'd def recommend the tacos.
