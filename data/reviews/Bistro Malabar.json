{"text":"Nowhere close to Malabar food. Biryani has no flavor, Curry is watered down, over priced. What  waste of money!! :("}
{"text":"So, a group of us, 5 to be exact, went to eat here. The place is quite plain, some might call it nonchalant, whatever. 2/5 for that.  There was no place to seat 5, not that it was busy, the tables are set up to seat only 4 max. So we went up and asked if two tables could be joined. We were told to wait. One table had just finished eating so they were leaving. We were asked to sit on the table next to that so that they could clean and join them. Fine. Our poor friend # 5 Sat on a chair on one side of the table. We were in the restaurant for a total of 1 hour 15mins, the table besides us never got cleaned of the dirty plates.   Well, we were hungry. We placed the order, after having to ask for a menu and also for some water after 15mins of sitting down. The girl was chirpy taking the order. Appreciated.  After that, came the LONGEST WAIT OF OUR LIVES. We kept talking and drinking water while 2-3 take outs happened. NONE of the restaurant employees acknowledged our presence after our order was taken. The chef/some guy in the kitchen and the reception girl kept going in and out of the kitchen a 100 times looking for an order. ALL THIS WHILE, we are sitting waiting for our order, hungry as hell. Mind you, this is on a Wednesday evening so all of us have to go to work the next day.  We waited for 45 MINS AFTER OUR ORDER WAS TAKEN to be informed that they have run out of an ingredient so we would need to order something else. The girl had apparently FORGOTTEN to place our order, or at least that's the excuse she gave us. INFURIATED AND STILL HUNGRY we left the place to OBVIOUSLY never return.  Too bad because you just lost 5 valuable customers and also everyone we can tell about this horrible experience where. We didn't eat but are so pissed off with the.lack of respect and customer service that we will NEVER return or eat from here."}
{"text":"First time trying this fairly new place.  Wanted to give it a shot.  WHAT A MISTAKE.  Simply put, they make shite food.  Sauces lack the fragrance and flavour of true Indian food. No fresh herbs, no inviting smells, just zero sense of care or love to it.  I've had better out of a jar.  In Mississauga they don't stand a chance... there is good Indian food all over the place.  They couldn't even make Naan for goodness sake.  Came to me burnt and disgustingly chewy.  And of course they forgot our Samosas which I didn't get to taste... which was probably a gift in disguise considering the horrible food.  Do yourself a favour.  Order anywhere else.  Do yourself A favour Bistro Malabar... hire a chef who cares or shut down and stop selling garbage."}
{"text":"We tried the vegetable Pulao, tamarind shrimp and parota. The food was delicious. Portion sizes were good. The service was great! This is a south Indian style restaurant with north Indian options as well.  The washrooms are clean too.  I would advise hitting the treadmill a few hours after, this is true after eating Indian food at home or this good restaurant!!"}
{"text":"In place of Pita Pit, we noticed this new restaurant recently opened. Looks like a family run restaurant from Kerala (India). The menu looks good, the dishes look kind of strong and spicy but appetizing. The service was fast and very friendly.  We tried the masala dosa, it was nice, a bit different from the usual dosa places that I have been to. It was a bit thicker and the sauces were different too, but nice and very tasty. It not too pricey around $ 8 to $12 a plate, and the serving are big too.  I will definitely be returning with the rest of my family.  Tip: please take wet serviette as fingers get messy."}
{"text":"Fairly new, friendly service,   We tried the dosa. Will go back to try the fish, wasn't overly impressed by the food we selected but the service was great."}
{"text":"Such horrible malabar food, i have never had in my life. These people dont know the meaning of salt or any sort of spice. Please stay away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered from bistro Malabar through skip the dishes. We are huge fans of all curry and Indian food. However this place did not taste authentic. The curry was missing something and the chicken tikka masala was not what we expected considering it is our favorite Indian dish. Ordered the mutton biriyani which was missing all the flavor that biriyani has. Sorry but this wasn't a great Indian food experience."}
