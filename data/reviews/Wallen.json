{"text":"Worst nightclub I've ever encountered.
Joined some friends who were waiting in line to get in when they informed us that they probably wouldn't be able to let us in because we didn't do bottle service.
We proceeded to tell then that we were willing to do a booth and continued to wait in line while they continually let other females who had just arrived in. They then literally brought a bouncer over to let us in, asking for proof of ID (which I showed) when the two employees working the door (an Asian girl and a Caucasian man with a beard) informed us that they would not let us in anymore. When I asked them (word for word) \"what is your gripe with our group, why can't we come in anymore\" the male employee looked me straight in the eye and said \"she just swore at me\" and accused me of being drunk. The bouncer then proceeded to show our group out of the line. Even after clarifying my statement, the employee continuously blamed me and stated that I was drunk and I was being abrasive to the staff.
I have never encountered such blatant racism and discrimination in a setting in which our group was more than compliant and respectful of the establishment's guidelines. The worst moment is when the male employee looked me in the eye and blatantly lied. This club is nothing more than a superficial bar located in a popular strip of queen street  looking for a generic crowd and profit that they approve of. I am usually not a person to leave at yelp reviews (you can check and see this is my first) but the treatment at this bar was so disgusting and disrespectful, I needed to say this."}
{"text":"A group of friends came here to celebrate two birthdays, got booth, got bottles, etc.

When it was time for arrival, only a select handful of the group got in while others were forced to pay for cover..? Even though, it should have been free entrance. The booth alone was $700, ordered bottles which came close to 1K, totalling up to almost 2K plus tips. Been told, the cover was part of the cost.

The question now is, why did the establishment forced cover on some and not others, with the amount of money being dropped on the night?

The music was shit, the venue was hot, poor ventilation. Staff has poor mannerism.

Rebel for the win."}
{"text":"Music was good. It got packed around midnight though. Overall, the experience was alright."}
{"text":"Literally the worst club I've ever been to in all of the GTA. My experience happened last night, after realizing my friends and I weren't gonna make it into apartment 200 cause of how long the line was. So we went into Wallen to get some drinks and try to have fun but honestly that didn't happen at all.

We got to the front, manager all of a sudden popped up out of nowhere and offered us a deal for $15 each instead of $20 for entry. Then I asked how it was downstairs and he said \"It's happening.\" Nah.

We get down there, it's a small venue with a lot of potential but Apartment 200 probably outshines it heavily. The furniture and decor was beautiful.

The crowd was.... an interesting mix. I wouldn't dress too nice here cause everyone dresses REALLY basic at this club. Easy to stand out if you rock really nice clothing. 

So now to the part that ruined everything. Let me start this off by saying I'm the type of person that goes to one specific bartender the whole night and then tips before I'm leaving. Always. No matter how drunk, I could NEVER forget to tip. 

I ordered 3 shots of tequila and 3 cranberry vodkas for myself and friends which came up to $48 and I handed over $50. Didn't get my change until I asked and the bartender, named Josh, said, \"A townie?!\" And I was just shocked and his belittling tone. So I just assumed it was probably a bad night for him and moved on to a next bartender this time it was a girl with Brown to Blonde ombr√© hair. I ordered 2 cranberry vodkas, came up to $16 and I gave a 20. She walked away with it and started fixing her hair in the mirror. Wtf?! So I yelled and asked for my change back again and she handed it to me and said \"I'm sorry I forgot\" and I said \"Okay well I just want to let you know you're the second bartender to do that to me.\"

Do YALL WANNA KNOW WHAT THIS B*!CH DID?!

SHE FLIPPED HER F^%KING HAIR AND WALKED AWAY. 

WHAT THE HELL LMAOOOOO

So whatever I realized this place probably sucks every night they're open that nobody tips them so they need to start stealing money from customers.

I brought it up to the manager and he said \"You were upstairs, we don't do that here\" pointing fingers at Apartment 200. I said, \"no I came HERE because I couldn't get in THERE. I'm not drunk, I know where I've been all night.\" And then he asked, \"which bartenders did that?\" I said, \"the bartender with a hat and flowy hair and the girl with brown/blonde hair.\" And he said, \"We don't have bartenders that wear hats\" Pause.  There were TWO bartenders wearing hats. And I said \"Yeah you do. One guy with flowy hair and a black hat with a 6 on it and another bartender with a buzz cut and a pink hat.\" And he said \"oh the first one was probably josh.\" Okay so he DID know they were wearing hats  

Anyways conversation ended and he realized I wasn't talking crap cause he followed me into the club and both bartenders were standing in front of the bar with hats on. And went over there to talk to both bartenders I spoke about and were all looking at me. 

I don't care about this establishment, I'd never go here, I would never recommend and quite honestly I'm gonna put this review EVERYWHERE.
You don't deserve business here.
Not at all. Close down. Apartment 200 owns that corner"}
{"text":"Throw the whole club away...

If I could give this establishment lower than one star I would. Booked a booth and bottle service for my 20th birthday well in advance at the beginning of the month. Given the fact that I am out of Toronto for most of the year, my repertoire for Toronto clubs was slim, so after researching a bit, we settled on this one. 

I got in touch with the bottle service person over text, and to be fair he did allow my party to purchase only two bottles instead of the three bottle minimum and was prompt with answering all of my questions, so I thought maybe the shit reviews they were getting made them step up their customer service game....lol

Arrived before 12, and was escorted in by an employee. Everything was going fantastic, bottle service girls were great, the party was starting, everyone was enjoying themselves.

I have obviously heard horror stories about how rude Toronto clubs are, so my expectations were low to start with... but they managed to surpass that. YAY! 

Not to say that we weren't intoxicated to a certain degree, no one (yes, not even me the birthday girl) was to the point of passing out or puking. You run an establishment that relies on selling people alcohol, so people are going to drink, especially on their birthday. However, under no circumstances is that a legitimate reason for the bouncers to proceed to slowly siphon my entire party out of the building under different excuses they pulled out of their ass, alternating between, \"I was going to pass out\", I was going to turn into a liability, or we finished our bottles and had to leave. It should also be noted that I somehow was able to enter my credit card pin myself and pay my bill without any help while supposedly being \"too intoxicated\". We were also precisely asked to leave 10 minutes after paying the bill. ODD!

Upon my friends trying to understand exactly why I needed to leave, another employee had suggested that I and one of my friends go out to get some fresh air, not knowing we were literally not going to be able to get back into the club. In hindsight, that was just a way to get us out so they could re-sell the booth to another group. Upon this realization, I tried to get back in because some of my personal belongings were still at the club, and I was not going to leave without them. The bouncers did not let me re-enter the establishment and physically put their hands on me. I should point out, for the third time, I was fully able to comprehend instructions, not falling over or getting sick, and am not a violent person. (I am also 5'6 and the weakest person ever so there was no justifiable reason for that). I was kicked out for no legitimate reason 10 minutes after paying the bill, with my friends left inside desperately scrambling to rectify the situation. 

After reasoning and fighting with the manager and owners, my friends, all pretty lucid at this point, were forced to leave the club. The owner threw us some free drink tickets thinking that we would ever come back. At one point, two of my friends who were the last to leave the booth were kicked out by a group of obnoxious guys who said the club had \"re-sold\" the booth. 

But the worst part was the bouncers. You can tell the bouncers really savor the 4 hours of each Saturday night they get to stand outside the doors and feel important. I have literally never encountered worse treatment, and the bouncers who are employed by this place are disgusting. They are misogynistic, verbally abusive and disgusting ogres who should be fired for treating people the way they do, but the saddest thing is that they will probably be just fine. They do the dirty work for the teenagers inside who run the place and make a living off kicking people out once they've made their money. My one friend who took me out for air, justifiably upset for being kicked out, was insulted and called derogatory and misogynistic slurs by the bouncers. Word for word, \"go sell yourself on the corner\". That is intolerable behavior from an establishment that is patronized by people who have just paid money for a service. You cannot just discard people and not expect them to call you the fuck out. 

Moral of the story, if you want to go to a mediocre \"club\" managed by young hype beasts who have no idea how the fuck to run an establishment and might kick you out if they feel like it, this place fits the bill!"}
{"text":"that winding down at 2:00...
I went here on a Friday night. It was better than I expected, ladies got in free before 11. It was a nice lounge with tasteful decor..with chandeliers on the ceiling, and sofas for booths, and a bathroom with character, and this red long table in the centre..great for when i need to lean on something.
The music was all good hiphop rnb rap and like 10 dancehall songs..
The room got comfortably crowded. Then at 2:00 people started leaving, and it wrapped up at 2:30."}
