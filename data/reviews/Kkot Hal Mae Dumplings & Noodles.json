{"text":"the dumplings are big and tasty but they have a lot of ingredients in it I don't really know exactly what it was beside chive and pork. This is a popular hangout or Korean ahjussis in the area. They often sit and drink while eating noodles or dumplings. Best ahjussi hang out in the area IMO"}
{"text":"It looks like Man Doo Hyang has a new owner and the menu has been downsized. Fortunately they still have the dumpling hotpots and the noodle dishes. 

Prices have gone up by $1 compared to Man Doo Hyang. The dumpling hot pot is still reasonable but now that a bowl of noodle costs $7.99, it doesn't feel that good anymore. (Yeah I'm cheap huh?) We ordered the seafood kal guk su (knife cut noodles) and a dumpling hot pot for 2. The seafood noodle was very lacking in seafood. Broth was good though. Not worth it. However, the hot pot more than made up for it. I swear they put 3 portions of stuff when we only asked for 2. 

The dumplings are filled with leek and some other veggies. Man Doo Hyang used to give you the option of kimchi or pork. I like leek so it's ok. 

I absolutely love the noodles here. The texture is a little chewy and the taste is mild just to my liking. Broth is orangey-red but it's not that spicy. For the health conscious, this place is much better. As far as I can tell, they don't use any MSG. All their dishes contain vegetables and no grease. For banchan you get kimchi, raddish (similar to Song Cook), and some vinegar cabbage. 

It's a very Korean place with a mom and pop feeling. The hot pot feels like a must have in the winter."}
{"text":"Try the mukenji kimchi chigae.  Thought I'd try it as the baechu kimchi here is always of a good quality - figured the chigae would be good and I am glad I did.  WOW, one of the best I have had outside of Korea.  The Adjumoni who runs this restaurant ensures prompt customer service and checks up to ensure you're enjoying your meal.  Not a big variety of panchan but what they have (three types of kimch) are primo.  Love this place.  KKot Hal Mae has become one of our go-to places.  Tae dan hi kamsah hamnidah kkot Hal Mae!"}
