{"text":"Just came across this taco gem in Gilbert. I ordered the taco pizza, from their secret menu, and let me tell you...it was DELICIOUS!!!  This concoction was the perfect blend of melted cheese, carne asada, pico de gallo, and salsa on a warm fluffy pita bread, not a tortilla like I mentioned in the video..sorry !  This was worth the 45 minute drive from Phoenix!"}

{"text":"Having grown up on the border, I'm quite the taco critic - but Midnight Taco has some of the best in The Valley. I loved the Carne Asada Burrito and the Chicken Taco. Really high quality food and the salsas are amazing!"}
{"text":"Welp, this place was a bust! No salt, no flavor, no bueno! But the atmosphere on a Friday is nice  it's for sure NOT a street taco's"}
{"text":"The best damn real street tacos that you can find out here in Gilbert. The owners are really cool and nice people. Became a regular here just for it being a pop up taco stand. You gotta try this place out!"}
{"text":"As someone from the LA area, I can honestly say getting genuinely authentic tacos is difficult in Arizona. Last night my fianc√© and I drove around in Downtown Gilbert looking for somewhere to eat, but didn't want to wait for any of the busy restaurants in town. We saw a taco stand and decided to try it.   These were THE best tacos we have ever had in the state of Arizona and the people running the taco stand were super accommodating and friendly. The flour tortillas were thin and delicious and the carne and chicken were bother perfectly seasoned. We look forward to going back for these authentic gems."}
{"text":"Hospitality,authenticity, and a great drunk taco experience. I'm second generation Mexican and have eaten great Mexican food my entire life and this taco stand meets and exceeds expectations. Wonderful experience here."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and burritos came here with my girlfriends and it's a great for a nice midnight bite after the bars!"}
{"text":"There is so many things wrong with this. First and foremost a wedo is cooking the food. The meat was chewey and had this odd taste. Street tacos are suppose to be on corn toasted tortilla. Not flour. Another gentleman was already disappointed with no horchata and no cilantro in the tacos. Its a very sad thing. Dont get me wrong though. The people  were very nice. But the food was just really disappointing."}
{"text":"This place sucks! They forgot to put guac and pico on everything and I ordered 8 tacos and got 5. This place can not handle big orders"}
{"text":"Wonderful!! Best I've had in a long time. Perfect time to sit outside too. Delicious fresh flavors. We tried the chicken and steak tacos, both are awesome!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had since living in Arizona.  Service was fast and the tacos were amazing.  Will make it a routine on the weekends to grab some food here!"}
{"text":"Best street tacos I've had. So fresh and delicious. It's a new food cart in downtown Gilbert and the owners are super nice."}
