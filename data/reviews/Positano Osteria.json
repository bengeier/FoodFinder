{"text":"A bit hit and miss.

The pasta was very good. The pizza was not very good at all. 

Good customer care. We got the pizza for free because the menu said it had grilled vegetables when it did not. They did not have a grill any more apparently. We even got a free desert.

I'd go there again and have the pasta. If you are after pizza, maybe try Brixx Pizza next door."}
{"text":"We went to Positano for my husband's birthday dinner last weekend, we can't wait to go back! The pasta dishes were clearly house-made and reminded me of the authentic pastas we had on our trip to Italy, the seabass was perfectly cooked, and my husband loved his Ossobuco.   The service was attentive, personal, and engaging from the hostess greeting at the door, the service staff and the manager and owner who were speaking with all of the guests in the dining room on a busy Friday night"}
{"text":"We finally found an occasion to try Positano's after read good reviews.  The food was fair, the service was fair, atmosphere was good.  We had 5 in our party, and the person who ordered the lasagna thought it was very good.  One person ordered the beef shortribs with gnocchi, and found the gnocchi to be a bit gummy in texture, but the shortribs were very good.  I had the chicken marsala, and while the sauce and mashed potatoes were very good, the chicken was overcooked and very chewy.  Another member of our party had the chicken with prosciutto and liked it very much.  The final order was for NY strip steak, which it was not.  Also, since the waitress failed to ask how he wanted it prepared, it was slightly overcooked, although the steak presented was tasty enough.  The waitress was friendly, but gone for l-o-n-g periods at a time.  The restaurant was at about 25% of capacity, so being busy was not the issue.  Overall, we enjoyed the restaurant, but I was disappointed after all the great reviews I have read."}
{"text":"Great service, food and Italian wines. Unfortunately, Positano is now closed. We will miss the family feel of the place."}
{"text":"I review based on my own 5 star scale in 4 primary areas. Food (quality in relation to price), Service, Presentation, and Ambiance. 
So my journey there was during restaurant week. They weren't packed so I assumed (remember the adage to never do this Dear Readers) service and food would be neck and neck. Not so... :-( The sad tale continues. App comes out 14 minutes after the order. Server coming and going and doesn't stop to check in or explain. Hmmm. Was I malodorous? No.. The hostess stops to check-in which was great since the server wouldn't. Ordered another glass of wine. Finally the app arrives. Whoosh - I'm invisible again. 15 minutes of insubstantiality later the manager stops by to offer more wine. Please. Second course arrives and the server is off again. Wait - he looks up from a distant table!!! He looks right at me AND goes right by. Maybe the chef was on fire... I checked, he wasn't. After the next course came I dealt with the manager and tipped him and the hostess. I let the manager know how Turkish Prison awful the service was.. Food quality 3. Presentation 5, Ambiance 3.5, Service Goose-egg (was a negative number initially but brought up by the non-server manager and hostess)."}
{"text":"Positano is one of my fav restaurants in Birkdale.  It's especially nice during warm weather to sit outside with a glass of wine.  Nice ambiance and nightly specials.  The only thing I don't like is their lunch \"buffet\".  It's pretty skimpy and the food isn't great."}
{"text":"Tucked away inside Birkdale Village, this restaurant is a real jewel and well worth a trip.  

I've made several trips to Positano Osteria and have had nothing short of excellent service.  After my first meal, I've been greeted by multiple people each time I've returned, all of them genuinely glad to see me again.

The meals themselves have been among the best Italian food I have eaten in Charlotte.  The appetizers are flavorful and classic -- I highly recommend the beautifully-prepared carpaccio.  The pasta dishes are fresh and well-made, with a delight of balanced flavors such as the Ricotta-stuffed ravioli in a sauce of butter, sage, and Parmesan.  The desserts are sinful...I've rediscovered the joy of canoli after having had too many dry ones elsewhere."}
{"text":"So after a terrible first visit + a nice note from the manager....I decided to sneak in for a drink only....I'll retest the service another day, so they gain a star.  

I can say the bartender was the same short haired girl...but her service was better...though the place was slower than the last time I was there....they gain a star this time...let's hope this is a trend with them."}
{"text":"Positano is one of the nicest--and most reasonably priced--restaurants in Birkdale.  The outdoor dining area is smaller and not as nicely laid out as Dressler's, but the service is always outstanding.  David (the manager) and Andrea and Michael (both servers) always make us feel welcomed.  Positano recently added a brick oven and they now serve authentic New York style pizza at very reasonable prices (under $10).  While my husband loves the pizzas, I always get the pasta, and neither of us is ever disappointed.  Drinks are also really good.  They have a nice selection of wine, beer, and martinis (their Positano Punch is my absolute favorite martini).  Try the wine dinners - they are offered once a month.  You'll get to try several different wines, and you will certainly get your fill.  You are also given an option after the dinner to buy the wine at reduced prices - we bought a dozen bottles on our last visit, it was so good!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food and service, really like the oil that comes with the bread too. My wife and I are definitely going back!"}
