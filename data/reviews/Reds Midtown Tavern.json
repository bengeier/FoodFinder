{"text":"This place wins on ambiance and drink selection, especially if you are obsessed with Gin like I am. Their Gin list is extensive. The place has high ceilings, industrial decor and dim lighting.   The food is a hit or miss. We ordered the Ahi Tuna Tostados ($14) to start and they were really really good. However, our entree, Chipotle Sirloin ($25) was just mediocre. It came with a sprinkling of salad (which had no dressing), unseasoned asparagus, and mashed potatoes. The steak was at least cooked medium rare like I asked,   Overall, I don't think I would choose to go here for dinner but if I am grabbing a drink and some apps this is a good place to to do it. Although, their cocktails aren't exactly cheap but that's expected downtown."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks. Price was really expensive but I guess u are paying for the trendy location. Service was not bad. No parking but that's like most places downtown. I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I love the chicken tacos here and the seared tuna. Both are delicious. Good central location right in the middle of downtown. Long street patio nicely set up with flower boxes. Comfy cushion banquettes or chairs. Your choice. Fancy slick interior design. I like the place"}
{"text":"I went here for summerlicios and ordered the sole crisp salad, the steak and parfait for dessert. The food was cold, under seasoned, the meat was tough, fatty and barely edible.  The food came out so fast you know the food wasn't made to order. It's too bad, summerlicious is supposed to allow you to try your menu and potentially gain new patronage. If I hadn't been here before then I would recommend not to go but maybe skip the prix fixe menu as it's underwhelming."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday evening, without a reservation. We were seated promptly, but our hostess tried to put us at a table right by the kitchen. We asked to move and she obliged.  Be forewarned - despite its Keg-like decor (lots of wood and glass), this place is pretty loud. The music is pumping non stop, making conversation difficult. It's definitely geared to a younger crowd.  The service was quite slow. We had to wait a bit just to get menus, and then another considerable wait for our drinks.  We both ordered entrees (no apps), as well as a bottle of wine. As we waited for our meal, we got hungry, so we decided to order an appetizer. Then, suddenly, our entrees appeared. I'd assumed our waitress would have put a hold on our entrees after we ordered the appetizer, but no.  We then asked our waitress to cancel our appetizer, since our entrees had arrived. She looked at me like I was crazy, and clearly wasn't happy about doing that, but she obliged. When she opened our wine bottle, it looked like the first time she was doing it.  My wife's pickerel was not good at all...not cooked properly and lukewarm. My seafood pasta was okay, but nothing great. We didn't bother staying for dessert. I'll not be returning, and would not recommend this place.  Also, make note: this place is pricey, too pricey for what you get in my opinion. We had two drinks, two entrees and a bottle of wine and our bill was $140. Way too much for this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great atmosphere and top-notch draft selection.  I found the food to be quite good, but somewhat limited.  My entree was the lamb sirloin salad.  The meat was prepared perfectly - exactly the way I like lamb.  However, the salad mostly was comprised of grain, with very limited greenery. This was a huge disappointment, as I was looking forward to some greens complementing the lamb.  That said, the preparation of the grains and salad on whole was very good."}
{"text":"It was my first time dining at Reds on Friday night -- casual upscale dining.  The location is great and the decor is very interesting. Take a look at the ceiling and you'll see some of their light fixtures made of wine glasses and beer bottles. The servers were friendly, but as it became busier throughout the night, their presence was a bit lacking.   I started with a Pear Bellini and it tasted all right, but I thought it was overpriced (as with many other items on the menu).  With appetizers to start, we tried the Calamari, Butcher Board, Lobster Guacamole, and best of all, the Crispy Potato Flatbread. The Crispy Potato Flatbread is a must-try. All the ingredients blend together so nicely, and the extra crispiness to the flatbread is like the cherry on top. I have to mention the tortillas that came with the Lobster Guacamole were greasy, but they were really nice and crispy, like they were straight-out-of-the-oven fresh.  For my main, I ordered the Chicken Carbonara. The egg was perfectly poached, and the pasta was perfectly al dente. This cream-less approach made this dish look like a low-fat carbonara (as one of my coworkers called it) and it tasted like so, except all the rigatoni at the bottom of my plate were completely soaked in oil.   All in all, I would return just to have their Crispy Potato Flatbread again, despite the slow service when it gets busy."}
{"text":"Terrible service. They wouldn't seat me and my friend because there were only two of us (at a four seater table), but seated four people who came after. Then when we asked the host about it, they had lied and said the table was reserved for them, even though the four people came from the same full-capacity bars we had just been to, looking for a table. It's all about money for this establishment. Never coming back and wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The decor is nice, outside patio is nice, service is nice, but the food is OK. First of all, expect to open your wallet when you walk into this place. We went after work around 5:30pm on a Monday evening. The place was teeming with people and since it was still daylight, we asked to be seated outside. Shortly after being seated we were handed our menus & wine list, and some water soon after. The salads come in two sizes and so do some of the appetizers. I ended up ordering a Kale salad while my friend went with the roasted chicken. We got our food perhaps about 20 - 25 mins after placing the order so that was great. My salad was healthy, fresh and had enough quinoa for me to have some intermittent flavour between the fibrous leaves. My friend enjoyed his chicken but complained about the lack of a proper side. As he put it \"A significantly better version of chicken than Swiss Chalet\". Not that we have anything against SC.   Overall, this place is decent but I wouldn't go out of my way for the food. Though for drinks and a casual lunch, I would definitely head here again."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the food here. I ordered the chicken and it was extremely dry and the carrot cake desert was nothing to brag about either.  I think it's a bit over priced for what it is.."}
{"text":"I dine weekly at any of the restaurants by Sir Crop, the management company that owns Red's. I spend over $800 a month at their restaurants and have always received good to excellent service. So I was very much looking forward to a Friday night out with a bottle of wine at Red's. What an absolute disappointment. We ordered our favorite, a Kermit Lynch Cote-du Rhone that was selling at an extremely good price ($42) as we typically pay over $60 for this bottle in Yorkville. It was disappointing to learn, 10 minutes later, that this wine was out of stock. Our waiter then mentioned they were out of 3 additional bottles, and after he pointed out which ones, we proceeded to order a different bottle of wine from Italy as well as some food. Imagine our surprise when he came back another 10 minutes later to tell us, that this bottle too, was out of stock. After asking him to check his cellar and come back, something he refused to do and insisted that they had all the other wines, we finally ordered a 3rd bottle. Few minutes pass and he comes back with a bottle. We take a look at it, and realize he has brought the wrong wine from a totally different Region (we ordered a European wine and he bought us one from Argentina). We point this out to him, and please note, it has now been 30 minutes and we have no food or wine. He goes to the bar and then comes back saying that this 3rd bottle is also sold out so they just substituted it to a different bottle! Rightfully so, I got angry and asked to speak to their manager. Their manager, whom I will not name, came over to us with a smirk on his face. I assume he thought we were students looking for a hand out. He leaned over our table, put his chin on his hands, and asked us what he could do for us. I re-iterated the story and the entire time he was just smirking away and not really caring about what we said. Not once did he apologize, he just made excuses and told us to give him 7-10 minutes to see what he had in his cellar. Within a munute he comes back with our original Cote-Du-Rhone! At this point, we wer done and asked to leave. Rather then apologizing, he just said 'Are you sure you want to leave? I will comp this bottle which should make you happy'. That was just adding insult to the injury here and we walked out. I received a survey asking me to rate my experience and I gave it a 0. I e-mailed back and forth with their Regional manager who apologized and made excuses and finally offered me a free dinner with a bottle of wine as well as a personal apology on the day we go there. I finally agreed to this as I thought he was trying. So when I gave him a date, imagine how I felt when he said he will e-mail a $50 gift card to the restaurant of my choice  They do not value customers. If they did, they would genuinely try to apologize, and if management is saying I will be there personally to greet you and dinner with wine is on me, why are you sending in a gift card and then capping dinner? The restaurant we chose - minimum we have ever spent there is $160!!  We declined his offer, as again, we wanted to bring attention to the service issues and get a proper apology, not a freebie. I will be thinking twice before I ever go into any of Sir Corp restaurants again will make sure I tell everyone of my experience.  http://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d5058760-r282140005-Reds_Midtown_Tavern-Toronto_Ontario.html#"}
{"text":"During our Toronto visit, we came across Reds Midtown Tavern and it was a gem of a find.  We enjoyed the baby kale quinoa salad, the potato flatbread, as well as the chowder and mushroom soups.  Each item was fresh, tasty and served in a timely manner.  The quality of service was just as superb as the food. Erin, our server made us out of towners feel right at home. Thanks Reds for a memorable dining experience!"}
{"text":"Second time here. First time they informed me late that the one i ordered is out of stock so they had me ordered again and gave it for me. But all my friends are done and just about to eat. Now, i ordered a medium well steak and my friend ordered a medium rare steak. They interchanged it, so i have mine be cooked again, when they gave it to me. It was burned (see pic)"}
{"text":"Amazing place for drinks and food in the downtown core. The decor is very welcoming and makes for a great place to bring friends for a night out."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner for the first time - I'd seen a deal thru work perks and wanted to try. The food was awful. Oversalted and dry. A mistake with the order took 10 mins to fix. Had to deal with an arrogant manager who refused a valid coupon. We left as soon as we could and won't be back.  Nice inside and clean. Not overly busy. The server was good."}
{"text":"Came late night for after dinner drinks. Friendly and accommodating service. Good beer list, with well versed staff. Large tvs and stylish surroundings make for a nice place to relax and watch the game while chatting with friends."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - 5/5 love the decor Service - 4/5 very friendly  and professional, not pushy  or robotic at all Value -3/5 a bit pricey for the portions but on par with other restos Food  - 3.5/5  SHRIMP & SCALLOP CEVICHE -fresh avocado and tomato, lime juice, serrano chile and cilantro on crisp tortillas  This dish was amazing 5/5, very refreshing and tasty.   STICKY RIBS -Caramelized in a spicy hoisin/siracha glaze with crispy wonton chips  This dish was 1.5/5, very dry, hard not fall off bone and WAYYY TOO SALTY. I had to stop eating, too overwhelming. Too much hoisin sauce. bleh   My friends had a daily special, a fish i cant remember the name of with a spash of butternut squash. It was really amazing. I wish i knew what it was called.   Overall, I love the vibe and rustic atmosphere of this resto. I would enjoy hanging out inside or outside on a nice sunny day here with my coworkers while gossiping . Ill probably be back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"For the price we paid for dinner for too I expected so much more then what we had got.. Atmosphere is awesome but food not so much. Server wasn't very friendly and at one point rolled her eyes at us.. We both had ordered Oscar steak.. When the server brought them to us he had given us wrong steaks I was eating my partners steak who was cooked differently and vice versa (person who brought out food was different then server) we had switched but after we had both had eaten some of each other's food which isn't a huge biggy.. Potato as the side was very cold and the steak was fatty and not the best.. We had told our server and she simply said \"oh\" would never be visiting here again and for $150 bill I expected way more... Disappointed"}
{"text":"Great decor and wait staff were great.  Thought the menu was hit or miss, and was disappointed by the lack of daily specials and just 3 dessert options.  Calamari were great, the hummus/side dip was delicious. Flatbread was well received too.  Mains: PEI Mussels: Good portion, nice presentation. Cioppino: Very disappointing.  It tasted like pasta sauce mixed with some canned tomatoes and hot sauce, not a broth at all.  Lamb Shank: Not bad.  Overall fair prices and decent wine list.  A bit more menu variety is definitely needed.  3+ , would return."}
{"text":"We had the chicken carbonara dish that was terrible with average service. The carrot cake lacked icing on it for some reason which I have not seen before. The pasta dish had no flavour and watery sauce which was terrible. I was very disappointed and not worth the cost."}
{"text":"Popped in for a beer and sonething to eat. I would advise change to the menu for the mushroom soup, advising it has chicken stock."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. I came here today with my girlfriend and we were seated at a larger table in a private corner. Ambience was great. Furniture and interior decorations were classic and upscale. Perfect for a romantic date-night. The service was amazing! We had a blonde lady, we suspect it was the manager by the way she was so professional and hospitable. She was great! Steak was cooked perfectly and smelled fragrant and delicious. My girlfriend had the filet mignon salad and raved about the tomato jam that came along with it. We had the Pinot Grigio which was probably not the best choice - will definitely opt for a red wine next time. Over all it was a good experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I salute the team that designed the space and setup. Trendy with a good sports straight up bar vibe. Definitely a place you could feel comfortable bringing a boss, coworker, just the friends or if you are a solo adventurist, it works.  The bartender did make a good old fashioned with a bit too large of a block of ice.  The bar was loud, and by that, when the server can't hear your order, I mean loud.  The menu has some great ethnic blends with traditional bar burger and steak options. I ventured for the curry crisp cauliflower and the lettuce wraps and also had a friend try the butter chicken entree. While the concept was good the flavors fell shy. The cauliflower was a little undercooked and not enough sauce to blend the flavors causing the curry spice to be overpowering. The lettuce wraps lacked all flavor and just weren't good.  In addition while I love the attention, having multiple servers is confusing.  Overall not a place I'd eat at again although a drink could draw me in"}
{"text":"Loved it. Best burger I've had in a long time. My son had a steak and he said it was great. Great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Their gin and tonic nights are amazing and come in the proper big fish-bowl like glasses served with garnishing appropriate for the type of gin you order.   The patio sits right amongst a relatively high traffic area which can be distracting but great if you want to be seen."}
{"text":"Overcooked CIOPPINO was terrible - returned that. Ordered the mushroom soup - bland bland bland. Disappointed in the food. Drinks and service were good but not sure if I will ever go back for food"}
{"text":"I come here usually once every two weeks, the food is great and always fresh, got to make some friends here and I know I'm paying what I'm getting, the fish is always fresh and high quality, make sure you order the sea food dishes when you at here!"}
{"text":"The service here is consistently bad. I live and work nearby but will never go back.. The food is ok but the staff really are inattentive and terrible at their jobs. Wrong orders, long waits, being ignored... I actually had to ask for the bill multiple times to several people for about 45min! I'm not sure they would have noticed if I just walked out. I Have tried to \"give it a chance\" a few times, I've been there for lunch and dinner, weekdays and weekends... I have regretted it every time. I have heard the same problems from my friends and coworkers."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!!! Food is over priced and wasn't even good small portions and was served cold !   I had the server bring all of our food at once after we told her we wanted the salads to start. She also forgot about our drinks for about half an hour ! Overall terrible experience and I probably won't go back !"}
{"text":"Shitty, disaffected servers pushing warm beer and small portions. We arrived as a group and were told we were subject to an 18% surcharge. On dead afternoon we ordered food which took forever, lacked the sides and was banal. Our waitress explained that she was busy \"hopping around\" and that someone else would look after us....and we waited..."}
{"text":"Reds Midtown at yonge & gerrard has a great location, tasty cocktails and delicious shareable food.  It'll be a good place to head to after work for a drink, date night or even a get together.  It's a huge space with lots of room for groups it seemed.  Favourite dish was the crispy potato flatbread, which was a savoury beavertail like dish... just amazing and couldn't get enough of it.  The steak frites was amazing as well! Didn't expect them to have such delicious steak but it was one of the best I've tasted in the city so far.  Chowder was great and their baby kale salad was delicious too... I really don't have anything negative to say as I fell in love with the spot and have suggested it to many friends already!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my champagne birthday with reds on Saturday evening. We were a large group and we received excellent service. Our waitress, was attentive and lovely and the food and drinks were delicious! Would definitely return again. The night was filled with extra special touches such as a birthday card from the staff and a specialized treat. Thank you to the team at Reds for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and easy walking distance from the eaton Center. The appetizer and shareable menus are ideal for late snack or after work gathering. Entree offering are limited and you might find something you like. The bar is well stock with wine, liquor and craft beer.  The hostess on shift tonight did not really ask us where to sit. She kept putting us in the back or in a corner that didn't work for us. At the end, we asked if we can sit where we wanted."}
{"text":"I've been to Reds a few times now - local for work lunches and I've never been overawed, just kinda 'meh'. This time around the food was decent enough - tandoori chicken salad - it is overpriced, but I guess that's downtown. Service was mediocre and not very flexible. As a beer drinker, the biggest problem I have with Reds is their ridiculous 14 oz 'pints' at premium price. Just offensive and smacks of an establishment that prioritizes squeezing every cent out of the customer over giving a quality drinking and dining experience."}
{"text":"That was seriously amazing!!!!!!!!  I mean 6/5!!! Service was good.   The calamari were cooked just the right way. Absolutely delicious.   The ceviche was awesome and fresh.  The only thing that it missed was a little bit more variety of fish or shrimp.  There was only one sort of fish in it. But seriously good.   The food,  I had the lamb shank.  Tender!!!  Tender!!!  Oh let me repeat it T E N D E R.  The olive relish was exquisite.  The polenta was just perfect. I'd take it again.   The Flourless chocolate cake... I never take desert since I'm not a fan but hey it blew my mind.  It tasted the banana.  The dark chocolate was tender. And the salt on the mousse just was awesome.   I had the sticky toffee pudding.  12/10!! I loved it.  Just the right size.  It was so good.  Not to sweet. Just perfect.   We also had the beefeater Gin with the zest and everything.  If you like Gin TRY IT!!   Bacon bourbon was OK.  Not exciting."}
{"text":"REDS is close to my place of work, so naturally a lunch or two will happen here. I like the interior and the ambiance of the restaurant. The drinks are very good, albeit pricey. I recommend a glass of the red sangria to make the rest of the afternoon more fun. They have a lunch special where you can chose a starter and a main or a main and a dessert for $20.00. Pretty good for a downtown location. I had their Caesar salad and the fish and chips main. The salad was light and perfectly dressed. I quite enjoyed it and the portion size was good for the price. The fish was very well done, but the fries were cold, unseasoned and tasted like despair. Perhaps a new person manning the fryer? I'll be back soon, Reds. Please step up your fry game, okay?"}
{"text":"We visited Toronto for a baseball game in the summer of 2016. A friend recommended Reds to us and we were so pleased. The food was fantastic- I had the roasted pork tenderloin. I never eat pork when I'm out because it is often too dry. This pork loin was prepared perfectly! Our server was wonderful. We plan on returning on our next trip to Toronto!"}
{"text":"I have been to Reds on several occasions and would go again. It is not perfect and a little on the overpriced side, but they do everything well.  Their turkey-peameal bacon sandwich is very nice, with a healthy portion of both. The wine selection is decent, and their Caesars are exactly what you want without anything super fancy.  The service is well-paced and friendly.  In fact there is not much to fault Reds for. It is a terrific neighbourhood bar/restaurant. Great for a date, a drink with colleagues after work, or to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Cam here with 16 other friends during Nuit Blanche because scaddabush next door was full. I like that it's easy to get a last minute seating for that many people. It seems to be a very loud sports bar. One of those places that you go and have a drink before going to clubs. Ordered the clam chowder as an appetizer. I was expecting it to be thick and creamy, but it seems to have more water than cream. So, that was disappointing. Then, I got the lamb for my main course. It was just a standard slow cooked lamb. Boring and unoriginal. Taste is ok, but it feels expensive paying $50 or so for dinner when served something that boring. I doubt that I will be coming back unless I'm eating with a big group."}
{"text":"1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3.5 Service: 3.5 Ambiance: 4 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  * Wine Bar * Takes reservations * Private Parties * Party room * Open for lunch and dinner  Where do you go for dinner when you have to stick around Dundas square? We don't get that many options unless we are willing to walk couple blocks away from the busy intersection. All we are left with is franchise restaurants (not that there is anything wrong with them, my favorite is Joeys) like Joeys, Jack Astors, Milestones, Pickle Barrel and etc.  So when I heard Reds Tavern was opening a second location at Gerrald and Yonge, I was more than happy to check it out- especially since I had pretty good dining experience at the one located on Adelaide in Financial District.  This location is much more 'hip and young' compared to the other location, filled with younger crowd from Ryerson and Eaton's Centre.  Reds Midtown Tavern is led by Executive Chef Matt Robertson, who has created an impressive menu of reimagined classics with a unique selection of social sharing plates.  Ordered: Calamari Fritti Di Amalfi 5/5  Oven roasted tomato aioli, fresh lime and fried rosemary and lemon for $11.25. I loved this calamari, first of all I was surprised by how big the portion was- it was enough to share between 4 people. It was done perfectly, seasoned just right and crispy outside. Very often I find aioli served at restaurants to be too watery, but the oven roasted tomato aioli that was served with calamari was bursting with flavor. I will def get this dish again when I go back.  Ordered: Maine Lobster Guacamole 3/5  Guajillo chili dressed lobster, hand mashed avocado, fresh lime juice, serrano pepper and warm, crisp tortillas for $17.95. This was an appetizer that I was very excited about but didn't really live up to my expectation. Crispy chips and guacamole was standard but the lobster on top didn't do much for me. Lobster pieces were big and fresh but it just didn't go together with the guacamole nor did it have much flavor.  Ordered: Cheeseburger Sliders 4/5  Classic mini burgers served with tangy American cheese, everything sauce and pickle for $14.50. 3 of these were served for us to share and they were surprisingly delicious. Patties were tender and juicy between Ace bakery mini slider buns and would be good even as a main dish.  Ordered: North Atlantic Seafood Chowder 2.5/5  Traditional New England chowder with cold water white fish, tender surf clams and a hint of smoked bacon, cup for $6 or bowl for $9. I ordered a cup to try and was satisfied with what it was. Creamy and filled with lots of seafood but it's not something I will remember to order again.  Ordered: Wild Mushroom Soup 2/5  Herb scented roasted chicken broth with woodland mushrooms, truffled enoki salad and crisp parmesan croutons, cup for $6 or bowl for $9. This is not your ordinary creamy mushroom soup! Some people might like this but I didn't really enjoy it.  Ordered: Avocado & Lobster Cobb  East Coast lobster with crisp pork belly, 63-degree egg, fresh croutons, cherry tomato and a poached shallot dressing for $26.95. This was another dish I was disappointed with. There weren't much lobster on this Lobster Cobb Salad and even minus the lobster, it wasn't a good Cobb salad. I def didn't think this was worth $26.95  Ordered: Bake Kale & Quinoa Salad 3/5  Tossed with sweet spiced pecans, dried cranberries, caramelized sweet potatoes, smoked Manchego cheese and a citrus vinaigrette for $9.50 (Starter size). This dish was ordered and shared as an appetizer and it was a nice light salad on the side.  Ordered: Cioppino 5/5  Light tomato and white wine seafood stew with PEI mussels, calamari, shrimp and scallops served with crusty garlic rubbed baguette for $19.25. Another solid dish I was excited to find during this dinner. Tomato stew was nice and hearty, def a winter food that makes you all warm inside. I will def get this again when I go back.  Summary: Thank goodness Reds Midtown Tavern opened on Gerrald street where it is much more laid back without that stiff financial crowd. It is a nicer walk from where I live and love the wide wine selection. I've been back couple more times after my first visit and I've always had an awesome time here. Def check it out when you are in the area and make sure to try the Grasshopper Parfait for dessert if you have room, it is so awesome!"}
{"text":"Portions small, overpriced, service was slow even though it was a Wednesday and restaurant was not very busy. Thanks but will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here on a Wednesday with a downtown friend and sat at the sidewalk tables so this is not an extensive review. The seating and service were quick and courteous. The lunch menu has the right number of choices and we both ordered burgers. The presentation was excellent and the burgers themselves were done to perfection and tasty with goodly portions of sides. Unfortunately, I couldn't partake in the adult beverages but would certainly return in the future to remedy that problem and try the indoor portion of venue which was pretty attractive at a quick glance."}
{"text":"I go out for dinner a lot and I've been to both Reds locations downtown Toronto and they both suck. Drinks are overpriced and the food is terrible. In fact, I have never paid for a meal because I end up sending the food back. I mean like common who can f%$# a hamburger? I would not eat there again even if it was for free. Whats really mind boggling is how people can give this place good reviews."}
{"text":"Service here always seems to be kinda slow. I've been here a few times and it's the same thing each time. No major complaints about the food or drink though."}
{"text":"Delicious mushroom soup, beef tenderloin is so soft and cooked perfectly. Delicious side of fries. WAnt more au jus. Atmosphere is beautiful, and love the seating. Great beer choice."}
{"text":"We came here for Winterlicious lunch and it was a huge let down, as you would expect from a chain resto. First of all, we were automatically seated in the bar area, not even giving the option of eating in the dining area. We had reservations and it was dead. The service was very good. The water was never empty and we had several servers attend to us.   The food was very basic and bland. I had beet salad, spicy shrimp & rice, and rocky road dessert. Beet salad was good and interesting, but the shrimp was something you could make at home, and the rocky road dessert was not good at all.   The Good:  1. Service. As I mentioned, I have no complaints about service and how fast our food came out of the kitchen. 2. Decor. Quite nice decor for a chain resto, I enjoyed all the Edison bulbs.  The Bad:  1. Food. Very bland and not worth the price of admission. 2. Selection. Was not a fan of the menu selection at this place.  Recommendation: skip this place, you're not missing much!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner again. Service is friendly and very competent. I had ribs for a change. I have been eating many salads lately, so I went for a half rack.  Ribs are usually hit or miss. They were a hit. The Apple pie with a double espresso was a treat. The sharables are inventive and worth trying. Comfortable restaurant and you don't feel crammed in. Sit in the dining room. Chairs are comfortable and the noise level allows for a conversation without yelling."}
{"text":"Came here for NYEs dinner and left again impressed with the food, service and drinks at Reds.   They offered a $49 3 course prix fixe dinner which was a great deal. Portions were large and food was quite tasty. I enjoyed my Ahi tuna chip appetizer and my steak & shrimp main very much.   I was also surprised at their Gin & Tonic offerings. You can actually customize your own or order one of their specialty Gin & Tonics. I ordered their Lemon Thyme version and it was amazing, one of the best Gin & Tonics I've ever had.   The service was also on point. The food and drinks came out in a timely manner. Our party of 9 had separate checks and our waiter handled it without a hiccup.  Overall I'm a fan of Reds."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great staff and great beer selection! Love the food 2! Defiantly a great addition to the neighbourhood and will def be a constant stop in the city, great bar staff and even greater management staff!  Try the flat bread and the sliders."}
{"text":"After the pretty ballerina had to bail out last minute due to not feeling well, it was a solo lupper for yours truly. This plae was chosen because OpenTable indicated they were taking ares at 15:30 or 3:30 pm! I was a fan of the old Reds Bistro, and when they announced the revamping and rebranding of the restaurant on Adelaide, as well as the opening of this location, I was fearing a Moxification or worse, a JackAstorization. Even though the decor is more rustic and rich in hardwood, living up to the tavern \"moniker\", and the establishment has shied away from all the haute cuisine trappings (tuxes on waiters, sommelier at your table, etc) the kitchen did not lose its lustre. Initially disappointed that the oysters of the day had run out, I ordered the Mediterranean braised lamb shank($22.95), described on the menu as \"8-hour slow-cooked lamb with creamy polenta, green beans, orange gremolata and black olive relish\" it is true to the description, falloff the bone and delicious. Polenta made this way is a revelation for me, and with this type of preparation is more enjoyable than rice or potato. Today, no green beans but al dente snap peas.To drink I had 9oz (18.00) and then 6 oz (12.00) of a superb red Bordeaux, Chateau Christoly, a great pairing with the shank as well as with what followed it. The dessert menu is uninspiring(carrot cake? flourless chocolate cake? mint and chocolate parfait? meh...)and would benefit from more creativity. Instead, I opted for the excellent cheeseplate (6.00 per oz so 18.00 in this case):  Picobello, a sheep milk cheese from  Spain,  Chevrechon, a goat from Quebec, and Celtic blue from Ontario. With garnishes of in-house candied walnuts, edible flowers, honey and raisin compote, this platter marries salty and sweet superbly.  So if you are looking for a decent meal near the Eaton centre and are neither hankering for Salad KIng nor for The Senator, but for something more refined, this is an excellent choice an affordable.  The only minus to me though is the seating. While comfortable, there are mostlyhigh chairs/stools available for a more tavernish/barish atmosphere. While this all fun and esthetically pleasing, I know many a patron who would prefer a normal chair.  Service was friendly and professional. Shasa and Jake were awesome.  So,yes,recommended."}
{"text":"First impressions were not that great. I happened to arrive with a group and the main hostess completely ignored me while taking the groups coats. Not sure what made me look like an outcast (perhaps it was the plant I was carrying from work as a goodbye gift) but still - at least have the courtesy to say \"I will be right with you\" or something... Then I had to wait awkwardly as the hostess took that group to their table and to wait for another hostess to take me to mine. Of course, it would have to be right underneath the stereo blasting loud music. Our waiter informed our table that it would be \"louder than normal\" as a group of lawyers bought out half the restaurant. In other words, SOL for us.  Our waiter recommended a couple of dishes to try, but OUTSTANDING were the wings. He mentioned that it was one of the best wings he had ever tasted, and our table agreed. I would come back here just for that. Two of my friends had the Lamb and, while it was great, it was nothing outstanding. Another friend had the Salmon, which was, salmon.  Total bill including tip, a bottle of wine and a glass of another wine came out to be just shy of $300. I wouldn't come here again for dinner as I don't think the price is worth the food. However, I can say a couple of things though:  1. It's a great place for groups and corporate events. Right by the entrance, there was a nice little private nook that could seat up 10 people I think. So, if you're looking to book for a private, smallish-group party, ask for that space. 2. I wouldn't come here for a dinner, but a great drinks place and wings (THOSE WINGS WERE FABULOUS!) There is a LARGE bar area in the centre of the room  Our waiter was great. I read a Toronto Life article once about all the \"idiotic questions\" NOT to ask a waiter including what is the best item on the menu and what do you recommend, but one of my friends asked these same questions to him and he answered it obligingly without an eye roll.   Really glad I tried this Reds, and tonight, it's off to try Scaddabush!"}
{"text":"Got a really good first impression by the friendly hostess and ambience of the place but once i sat at the bar everything went downhill from there. Waited over 5 minutes to even get acknowledged by the bartender. No hi how are you or friendly small talk or even a crack of a smile. I ordered the chicken tandoori salad. I was told it was a good choice but it was quite opposite. The chicken was too charred so all i good taste was burnt charred chicken. I was also told the chicken was a 5-6oz portion...negative...it was only about 3oz. They were chinsy on the cashews (only got two in my salad) and crispy cauliflower (only a few little pieces). The bartender never once asked me how my food was. I would have asked for a new chicken and more topping had i been given the opportunity but didn't feel like complaining. After the subpar meal the server handed me the bill. I paid and still tipped her 20% and thanked her. There was no reciprocation whatsoever...she didnt seem in the slightest grateful for a 20% tip that she certainly didn't deserve as there was thank you...no you're welcome...no have a nice evening. Just left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm not sure how that bartender even has a job there. The quality of service and a friendly, outgoing personality is what matters most during a dining experience and i know this because i worked in the hospitality and service industry for over 15 years. Pretty straightforward concept. Perhaps she was having an off day but everyone knows that in that industry in particular you gotta leave the excess baggage at the door. I would not go back based on the price tag and the impersonal experience."}
{"text":"I used to quite like Reds despite it's corporate connections but I've noticed from my most recent visit that their new menu appears to have scaled back portions yet maintaining the same prices as before. The ahi tuna beet salad that I've ordered at the Adelaide location twice before was an amazing dish - plentiful helpings of beets (both raw and roasted), crisp greens and a nice portion of seared sesame crusted tuna with this supreb dressing. Now it's a sad little salad they've tried to pass off as an entree when it was barely filling enough for a main meal... Thank goodness I was going to another party after that cause I was starving!! The salad used have so many beets (which were deliciously prepared) but this time I could barely find 4 pieces on my plate... wtf beets aren't even that expensive?!?! I'm pretty sure the departure of their previous corporate chef Michael Hunter has something to do with the now mediocre, clearly scaled back portions to maximize profit food.   Sorry guys I can't recommend Reds anymore even for that beet salad. Come here strictly for drinks and maybe apps - the atmosphere is nice but the food is so-so unfortunately."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we came here for the summerlicious lunch.  1st time - service was fast and food was great! 2nd time - service was slow and food was okay...  There were 8 of us and we made reservations ahead of time.  Despite coming here on a friday, this place appeared pretty quiet and the service was quite slow.  Appetizers: I got the Shrimp Gazpacho Salad - there were slivers of shrimp in a cocktail glass.  It was okay... nothing to write home about.  There was a lot of thousand island dressing on it  Main: Pan Seared Trout - portions were decent but i thought the fish was kinda fishy... It also needed some lemon but there were none provided on the plate.  Dessert: Chili Chocolate Pot de Creme - the chili was overpowering... everybody made a face on the first bite.  I didn't end up finishing mine as it was just a bit too strong.  Ambiance - nice, dark and has a rustic feel.  They also have a patio area if you don't mind sitting on the sidewalk....   Overall: I like Reds midtown - it's less pretentious than the one in the financial district, but I like the food better at the other location."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during Winterlicious on a quiet Saturday afternoon.  The good: We we're impressed by the decor. There were Edison bulbs, and brick walls which gave the restaurant a nice vibe. The service was also a highlight of our visit. Staff were friendly and attentive during our entire meal. There is a gigantic and beautiful bar area for those looking for a few drinks as well.  The not as good: The food was okay but nothing to rave about. Not sure if it was because of Winterlicious but the food felt very basic.  Overall, Reds will offer a comfortable and relaxing venue to go on a date and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"I went here with a few friends with high expectations. The decor is just awesome and makes for a great atmosphere inside. Of the three mains we had at the table, none of them were exciting or anything I would recommend.  I'd be more likely to come back here for drinks and appetizers than for a sit down meal."}
{"text":"Great ambience, friendly staff (even if it a bit too stretched as we only saw our waitress every half hour or so). Food was pretty good for a franchise restaurant (similar to moxies quality)."}
{"text":"2.5 stars rounded up to 3 thanks to a decent craft beer menu. My overall experience was mixed - I doubt I will return.  Service was mixed. It took about 15 minutes before someone took our 1st drink order. Our server was polite and friendly but hard to find throughout the night. At one point I asked a different server for a beer and he said he can't help, he's not my waiter. WTF?... we were a group of 15 with a bill +$1,000 and another server can't help out?Later in the evening the hostess helped out a little.   The beer selection was much better than I expected for a wine bar. About 10 craft beers on tap from Ontario. Served in 16 oz glass instead of a traditional pint size. Diversified wine menu but I'm no expert in this regard.  For dinner I had the turkey sandwich and fries. The sandwich was ok but the Turkey meat was cold cut style and a little salty. The fries were excellent. I also tried the oysters, calamari and sliders - the sliders were the clear winner.   Great atmosphere with high bar top tables - perfect for larger groups of people. Music was 90's hip hop on a Friday night - not my thing. Bathrooms downstairs were always occupied so you had to run upstairs instead, a little annoying.   Reds just didn't wow me on my visit. Every positive experience was immediately followed by a negative one... 50/50 doesn't cut it.  BK"}
{"text":"I can't believe this is at Yonge and Gerrard! What a change!  This is quite an upscale pub for the area. The Elephant and Castle and Pogue Mahones have been the only choices nearby for years, but this pub really takes it up a notch.  This is a huge restaurant with a wonderful atmosphere and a couple of partial second floors, meaning most of the space has huge ceilings. Lots of brick and interesting light features.  The beer and cocktail list is extensive, as you would expect from a more upscale pub. The prices were actually pretty reasonable though, which I wasn't expecting.  The menu was also interesting. I went with the tandoori-spiced chicken salad, and it was very flavourful with a decent portion size.  The service was great and well organized. I arrived before my wife and they took her name so that they could direct her to my table. Again, this place is very big.  I definitely plan to return to explore the rest of the menu. There will also be an outdoor patio at the corner near Yonge, which I think will be fantastic for the area."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come to Reds for sometime. Well reviewed and recommended in circles around the office. Often used by colleagues for lunch time office celebrations...birthdays, seasonal celebrations etc.   I was a bit nervous because I'm more of a slow, intimate, quite kind of a diner. Less of a steakhouse, loud music kind of a guy. Some of that might be because I'm a vegetarian.   The setting was intimate, gentle lighting. Music a touch loud for my delicate constitution but hey, 80's music is always a winner.   The food was above, way above expected. Garden salad, truffle fries to start and there was the flash back to Tuscany.   My partner had the salmon dish, fingerling potatoes with heirloom carrots and snow peas. 11 out of 10.   I had the vegetarian, vegetable fricasee. Delicious, perfectly cooked and bursting in flavour if not a little too busy with the aforementioned flavours. 9.5/10  Apple pie with cheddar, outstanding. Espresso delicious. Staff professional, friendly and attentive. What else can be said? Shout out to Felix the waitstaff for making the visit memorable."}
{"text":"Good selection from the Winterlicious menu - we found the portions to be quite large and food was tasty.  This would be a great place for drinks at Happy Hour but for lunch time, the service was very slow.    I would return for some beer and wine, but not a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Giant goblets of gin and tonic.  $8 on Friday nights.  This was a recipe for success!    I organized a social event for a large group and we sat at a table in the shape of a U.  I hate going out for dinner and sitting in a long line.  This unique set-up allowed for conversation across and between everyone.  I liked it.    The servers, Fab and Jonathan, were excellent.  Extremely attentive, friendly, and entertaining!  I couldn't have asked for more.  Thanks guys!  The food was quite good and everyone was able to find something they liked.  We tried a couple of starters too, the potato flatbread and the lobster guacamole with chips.  Both were yummy.  I had the seared ahi tuna Niçoise salad.  I thought the dressing to be a bit heavy but the fish was perfection.  I wished the portion were a tad larger though.  Upon making the reservation, I did ask for separate bills.  This wasn't a problem.  They even split the appetizer amongst ten people!  Impressive.    With a large party, the auto-grat was 18%. Very fair given the lovely and lively evening we had!  Thank you for making my night!"}
{"text":"So, last night I was invited out to a concert by my girlfriend at the last minute when a friend bailed. She had paid for the tickets so I thought I would take her out for an early dinner in the area before the show.  Seeing as Reds Midtown is in the area and that I like the original I figured we could give their new \"midtown\" location a try.   This was probably a mistake.  I've been to the original Reds on a few occasions and have always found it to be a good afterwork location in the financial district. However, their new location has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. This bad taste is a lot like a big warm glass of pure butter (more on this in a bit).  We arrive at dinner just before 7 and were greeted by a friendly hostess who gladly took us to our table. The restaurant was half full but we were \"lucky\" enough to be seated at a half lit table right by the entrance of the kitchen. This table is great for people who really want to see the inner workings of the restaurant world because after last night I now have a full understanding as to how waiters punch in orders and the bickering between staff that goes on at the entrance to a kitchen. (Incase you didn't realize I'm being sarcastic and I found this table to be a personal attack on me as a human being)  After strategically picking seats so that we were both in lit portions of the table we decided to peruse the menu. The first thing that became clear was that this is a far smaller menu than the original Reds with more of a focus on the casual items from Reds. After an elongated wait I ordered The Stockton St Club, my girlfriend got The Southern Thai Slaw and to start we split the Yukatan Ceviche.  (NOTE ABOUT THE MENU: There is no \"Stockton St\" in Toronto. Though after a lengthy investigation there appears to be a Stockton Rd at The Allen and 401. Sooooooo, typo perhaps?)  Let's start at the beginning, shall we?  The ceviche left a lot to be desired. Delivered in an old fashioned glass it was pretty much impossible to get to the ceviche with the supplied tortillas once we were halfway done. Beyond this glaring failure in dish engineering the ceviche just stunk. The fish lacked firmness to the point where it was essentially mush. The dish was mixed poorly with not nearly enough acid at the top and far too much at the bottom. As if that wasn't enough the kicker was the fact that they didn't even give us plates. But hey! When you're at a table like this what more do you want?!  Onto the mains, the club sandwich had some sort of green paste mixture that I'm pretty sure in the freshest guacamole that Subway has to offer. This sandwich is also great if you've ever wanted to taste what a piece of rye bread dipped into a vat of butter tastes like. The sandwich was falling apart before I even took my first bite as the soggy butter bread just could not take it anymore! Needless to say I don't know what club I'm in after having this disaster but I want out.  I don't know if there's anything I can say about The Sourthern Thai Slaw Salad that my girlfriend didn't say when I asked her how it was. She frowned and said, \"This sucks\".  There you have it! Don't go to Reds Midtown because it is just the worst.  Honestly, I'd dump me too if I took me to a place like this."}
{"text":"For those who haven't been to Red's it would be comparable to Milestones, Jack Astors, etc. The \"midtown\" location is situated at Yonge/Gerrard in a newly built condo building. The restaurant itself is pretty nice. Large space, open with decent amount of seating.  The waitstaff are friendly and eager to please their customers however the waitress we had wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu items.  The restaurant has a nice craft beer, drink and wine selection to choose from. The food was disappointing. Selection was not great; the menu is a one-sided large sheet. Our table shared the potato flatbread and calamari  which was very greasy. I also had the chicken carbonara which was boring. My friends ordered the lamb shank which they enjoyed. For dessert we shared the carrot cake- it too seemed oily.  I wouldn't go back to Red's unless they change up the menu. If you're looking for a young and lively setting with great food and drinks I would recommend Earls instead."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming one of my favourite places to go.  Went on Valentine's Day, with my \"anti-date\" (just a friend).  It was late when we go there, already past 10 pm.  We sat ourselves at the bar.  Right away, the bartender came over to give us cocktail menus; we asked if we could still get food, he said the kitchen goes to midnight.  I had just been there a few days prior, but the menu was all different, with some new great sounding additions.  Turned out we were seated at the bar next to all the staff who were getting off for the night, as they got cut, they joined the party.  This could have been a really exclusive, annoying situation, but they still acted like a respectful customers and as food kept coming out, I saw them eating some steak frites and knew that's what I had to have.  Steak was done exactly as I'd requested, really good.  Because it was Valentine's Day, the bartender made us some shots on the house -- how sweet is that??  They were really good, too!  They had a \"DJ\" spinning some dance music, but it was all stuff I actually liked, and I had a great time as always.  Such a great addition to the neighbourhood.  Yay!"}
{"text":"The Positives This restaurant should have just started off as a bar/lounge. Their appetizers are top notch and when I mean good, I mean excellent. We ordered the chicken wings which were actually a bit spicy but they were amazing. I love the sauce because it's heavy and creamy, I was licking my fingers going yum yum. The other dish we ordered was the maine lobster guacamole which had the best testing crisp tortillas. These tortillas were big and I swear my friends took all the guacamole before I could grab more.  The Negatives The only problem with the apps? They were skyrocket expensive lol. And now we move onto the entrees. The grilled cheese sandwich priced at roughly $13-14 was warm and tasty but the portions = too small. I've had a grilled cheese sandwich at Joey's and they were better. But you know what it wasn't bad...and then the umami burger came and holy crap, what were we eating? The portion for this burger was adequate but everything tasted so dry. The burger had a very bland taste and I gave up eating that thing half way through. I think I might be mistaken here but this restaurant does not offer beer in pitchers or half pints, perhaps because this is fine dining? I am not too familiar with that and our group felt disappointed - only half of us ordered pints afterwards.  The verdict The restaurant looks extremely nice but is a hassle to locate - even for those who are good at google. I found it weird that the washrooms were located on the second floor - very atypical for a fine dining restaurant like this - not deducting points, just an observation. I found the servers extremely helpful and really think they deserve an \"A\". The biggest disappointment is in the food: for the price we were paying this restaurant doesn't justify a second visit. This restaurant can do so much better and I really wish it can."}
{"text":"We came here with a food promo from work.  In their defense, we came a tad late. Around 1030.  We were offered the shareables menu, and made our choices from there. We tried the fried calamari, the charcuterie, and the mussels.  Calamari was delectable, nice and and crisp. The batter was one with the squid, which is a big deal for me.  The mussels were excellent. Served with grilled bread and not on the cheapy side. A healthy serving that more or less made or experience.  The charcuterie was less then impressive, mostly prosciutto and the sides were whatever. Definitely would not order again.  The bartender knew how to make a martini, which is nice. He wasn't too impressed with the promo coupon for the food though.  Fair enough, I'm a bartender and coupons give me grief!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I live nearby and was pretty excited that a wine bar had opened up since there's nothing really like it in the area. I dropped in on a Friday night with a gal pal for a bottle of wine. The wine list was pretty good, although for a wine bar I would have expected a lot more on the list. The decor is sophisticated with funky modern (dimly lit) chandeliers, hardwood and luxe leather chairs stools. There's a semi-private area upstairs which has more of a vintage feel that would be great to hire out for a party or work function. I love bathrooms that have moisturiser etc. so an extra point for that! I wish we were hungry so we could have tried out the menu. My flatmate was somewhere else in the bar that night and told me that they have a beer sommeliar and he got a few free tastes of beer. He's been raving about the place ever since, so I think this is likely to become our local neighbourhood hang out!"}
{"text":"I came back to Toronto to try Reds Wine Tavern which I love but found Reds Midtown Tavern instead. Glad I did. I am a gin drinker and I found the best Gin and Tonics I have ever tasted and seen. Reinvented.  Love the staff as well.."}
{"text":"Cute place for drinks and apps. We stopped in here for the lobster guacamole, mussels and some wine. They have a large bar and played really good music.  Fun little place. Good pricing."}
{"text":"This place was such a disappointment!! I went with my cousin for their Happy Hour service. We got there at 2:34 PM! The host in the front sat us immediately. I personally requested to sit in the back of the restaurant because the stools she was trying to give us were too high and I'm 5'2 (not a good combination when you've been walking all day and your feet and legs hurt). The restaurant was super chic, well decorated, and snobby like. Our waitress didn't come to greet us until 16 minutes of us sitting down. When she finally comes over she left the menus and walked away. To get her attention to come take our orders we had to wait another 8 minutes. (FYI-- the restaurant was EMPTY!!) There were exactly 3 more tables aside from me! She comes over and takes our starter order. We received the food pretty quick! The quinoa salad, ravioli and the mushroom soup were pretty amazing! She then takes another 23 minutes to come to our table after I've been bobbing and raising my hands like I'm going down a roller coaster. She never asked \"is everything okay?\" \"How is your food\" \"Do you need anything else\"- just completely ignored us! I was so upset by then that the food I wanted to order was a NO! I asked for my check and took myself to another bar to eat my dinner. It was a true disappointment! I honestly felt like she was avoiding us on purpose! We were the only caramel colored girls in there! Everyone was white. It sucks bc I did want to order more ravioli! And that's the only reason they got 1 star from me!!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot to grab a drink or cocktail, open until 1:00am during the week when a lot of other spots are closed. Nice big open space and they do have a couple of tv's at the bar. If you want a simple snack grab the nachos and guacamole. The washroom has a push to lock button. Make sure you remember to push it. LoL Cheers!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu. It's a little bit of everything in an almost exotic far away land kind of way. Indian inspired, Thai inspired, seafood inspired dishes. I'll be honest it's not my foodie palette first choice but I'm happy I tried them out anyway.   I really enjoyed my experience there overall. I interacted with 5 staff throughout my lunch and they were all very lovely to speak and engage with; from the hostess, to server, to serving staff to the manager.   I had the seafood chowder which was delicious, the smoky bacon added a nice touch to the seafood. I had their Cheeseburger which I added the smoked bacon, combined with their horseradish secret sauce it was an unbelievably amazingly juicy delicious burger. I couldn't finish my salad that came with it. Plus a soda. $29 + $4 for tip.   I consider their prices slightly above average but considering the quality of food and quantity and overall experience it was worth it. The atmosphere is elegant. The exposed brick, leather back chairs and wooden chairs combined with the industrial lighting and drapes was perfectly balanced. The music was not too loud. Bathrooms are upstairs.  So I was checking out all three restaurants; Red's, Scaddabush and Duke's (all owned by the same company) to decide on my vote for a Christmas lunch with my colleagues. I had a not so good experience at Scaddabush (see that review) the hostess at Red's asked me to come back to let her know my decision after trying all three. I want to include my experience to let you know how awesome Red's is...  I popped in to let her know and she was disappointed by my story (about Scaddabush) and let me know the general manager was there. I spoke with the general manager and relayed my story. She quickly apologized and offered me lunch since I didn't get one. I kindly thanked her for that but stated I had to get back to the office as the service next door was also slow. I asked that she relay to all the staff at Red's that what they are doing there is great and to keep up the great work. They will be my number 1 choice. Christmas lunch or no Christmas lunch."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly. However, it is extremely loud in here, and the seating was cramped on these high-chairs which made everything quite tight.  Sometimes when you're not really comfortable in a restaurant, it just doesn't make the night very enjoyable, regardless of how good the food is. Having said that, the food was inventive, but very bland.  Regardless of what you were eating, app, main or dessert, everything tasted the same.  Also, the waitress kept taking things away before we were finished, including the bread (which was not free), which is a definite no-no.  I would never come back here, nor would I recommend it."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 8 women. All of us loved our meals. What impressed me even more was the service. Although our food took longer than the server would have liked, she was great with keeping us informed that the kitchen was slammed. We could see that it was, so she wasn't exaggerating in the least. On top of that, I didn't particularly enjoy my mojito. I found it a little too citrusy and the server apologized, offered to get me something and removed the drink from my bill! How's that for service! Highly recommend checking out for dinner. Especially if you're a steak and wine lover."}
{"text":"It was OK, I should really give it another chance.  I got the sweet potato flatbread because of all the great reviews on yelp, but it was just okay, not super fabulous or anything.  I also had the Lobster Guacamole which was okay as well.   Usually the apps are better than the mains, but these apps were just regular, nothing mind blowing.  I felt like this was just like every other chain bar/restaurant.  We were a large group and we were seated at this weird table that had a cut out in the center, I guess it's so the staff can serve each person without squeezing by, but it made it more uncomfortable for us because we couldn't yell across the tables and the gap to talk, so we would get up and walk around and cluster around the table, thus cramping the space of the poor people that were sitting at a table close to us.  I'm sure they got hit many times by both the staff and our party."}
{"text":"With so many upscale fast casual options in Toronto, Reds was pretty disappointing.   I came with a group of 8 friends for a summer reunion -- we'd made a reservation ahead of time and were promptly seated. However, the seating is a bit awkward for large groups (the tables are huge and it's hard to hear anyone besides the people sitting directly in front or beside you).   I ordered the cobb salad adding ahi tuna (~$22), my friend ordered the kale & quinoa salad adding chicken (~$21), and everyone else ordered the popular chicken carbonara. We were all sorely disappointed with what we got. There was nothing special about my salad and barely any pieces of tuna. The carbonara was lackluster and lacked any depth of flavour. I tried a bit of my friend's salad and it was the most expensive boring entrée I've had in my life.   For the price and buzz this place usually gets, the food was definitely worth it.  The only redeeming factor was its capacity to host large parties and, although I haven't tried any, probably their wine. Otherwise, I can't see why any would go back with all the other options in the city."}
{"text":"The steak dinner was awesome! We got a chipotle steak that was part of $32 prix fixe menu.The place was busy even during the week on a rainy day, so better make reservations. Ambiance and service were both great, wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"Walked in when looking for a drink special on a VERY cold Wednesday night. The bartender was so friendly and took pity on a Florida girl experiencing -2 temperatures. I didn't get anything to eat, but loved the $5 (Canadian money) beer.   The real treat here is the \"make your own gin and tonic\". OMG. I chose my gin, a nice light tonic and was able to put my own accoutrements in (juniper berries, orange peels, etc). TOTALLY worth the $11.   The bathrooms were impeccably clean and very pretty (strange for a bar). The decor in general, was great. Loved the friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Argh. This is sort of a bummer because I previously came to Reds for an event, really liked it (and its affiliates next door), and had put it on the office party shortlist. In the meantime, I brought someone for birthday drinks/snacks...which as you know inexplicably and inevitably causes whatever place you choose to let you down in an epic manner, causing embarrassment to all.  My friend's medium-rare steak ($20) came completely overcooked (literally 100% of the outside was charred). We patiently waited for probably 20 minutes for someone to come our direction. Several servers floated by but never made eye contact or approached us before leaving again. Then they just disappeared. I finally managed to get our server's attention as she was about to walk away again. The replacement was done properly but it mystifies me why they served the burnt one in the first place.  Oysters ($18) were tasty of course, but it beats me how 6 (3 of them tiny) constitute a \"shareable\".  Over 2 hours, no one refilled our water. We waited for a long while (notice a pattern?) with empty glasses, then I eventually walked to the bar, grabbed a pitcher, and did it myself. Allllll night. There was no one to flag down. Ever.  I would have ordered some drinks (I'd asked for water to start while we were perusing the menu), but...there was no one to flag down.  The DJ was fine and this is not supposed to be a quiet venue, but the music was deafening, which made it difficult for my friend and I to converse while trying to pass the time between filling our own water glasses.  It was pretty dead after the happy hour crowd left, yet service was nonexistent. By the time someone checked in with us after 9, it was time to leave, so we just got the bill.  I owe my friend a make-up birthday outing. Any recommendations?"}
{"text":"Simply Amazing! First the service; food and ambience is perfect. We took our aunt for her Bday and she loved it too. First time to Toronto and they def made our experience great! Cheers to Nicole for being a great waiter, Mike did great too he was training with her. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Nice looking place with plenty of craft beers, and the folks that work there were great. The food was a bit of a mess, the $20 charcuterie board was an embarrassment - that being said, the frites were proper. I'd go back for a beer, but not as a spot to eat. Basically this is a Jack Astor's for the 19 - 25 hipster crowd."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary. He lives in the same building and I always pass by the restaurant. We thought to give it a try. The decor is absolutely amazing.   Why do I give it two stars? We had to wait a ridiculous time for our meal and drinks. When the food came, it was just alright. I had the Cioppino. The food was a little cold when it came and my bread was burnt. On the other had, their calamari was absolutely delicious. For dessert, we share the flourless chocolate cake. Again, it took forever to come out and I did not like it one bit. It was way too sweet.   I left the restaurant with mixed feelings and am not sure I'd return due to the incredibly slow service. Also, the food was just alright.   I guess it also doesn't help that I had gotten food poisoning that night..."}
{"text":"Went here last mothers day.  The decor is unique and beautiful.  The waitstaff were really fun.  The fire alarm in Aura above provided hilarious entertainment and the 'moms' were mondo-entertained by the firemen who arrived.  The food was good, and we had a great time!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Service: excellent. Everyone from coatcheck  girl to server had amazing smile. Super friendly staff.   Decor: beautiful. I have a soft spot for exposed brick walls and this place features exposed brick wall throughout, very inviting. There are communal tables for groups in one section of the restaurant.   Plus: TV by the bar for hockey fans. If you are bored for some reason, use the note pad and pencils on your table to entertain yourself.   Food: shared chicken carbonara and smoked turkey/peameal sandwich with fries. Chicken carbonara came with a poached egg so had to try it.  It was creamy , salty and tasty. The sandwich was good but nothing out of ordinary. The blanco roll was soft and they don't skimp on the meat. Fries were delicious with the right amount of salt. A bit disappointing that they don't have sweet potato fries. Oh, they have the same menu for lunch and dinner so portion was big for lunch.   In summary, absolutely loved dining here. Will return soon!"}
{"text":"I've been to the other Reds, and when I found out they were opening another location by my apartment, I was ecstatic!  I've been here multiple times since their opening, so this review isn't specific to any one time. The common trend when dining here with friends are the Shareables.  Absolute Musts: - Tavern Butcher Board: rotating selection of charcuterie, with addicting mustard seeds (and I don't even like mustard!) - Baby Kale & Quinoa Salad: maybe it's the dressing, or the sweet potatoes, but I find myself ordering this every time - Crispy Potato Flatbread: the server recommended this to me, and is probably the best Shareable  Hits - Lobster Guacamole: the chips alone are good enough to snack on - Cheeseburger Sliders: overly cheesy, and the 'everything sauce' resembles the sauce in a Big Mac - PEI Mussels: order extra bread for the white wine sauce! - Oysters: load up with the accompanying horseradish, mignonette and cocktail sauce - Seafood Chowder: generous portion and ratio of seafood to potatoes  Misses: - Chicken Wings: nothing special and pretty meh - Desserts: time to change up the dessert menu  While both locations have the same menu, I find this location has a better vibe and better service. I look forward to my next dinner :)  Random note: they give you matches instead of mints or toothpicks when you get your bill"}
{"text":"I was bedazzled by the very upscale and classy decor in this restaurant. The vintage-classic leather upholstery and seating stood out to me.  A must try is the Roast Beef Grilled Cheese Sandwich. (aged cheddar & provolone, caramelized onion, horseradish crema, red wine jus).   Wow, that horseradish crema dip is sooooo delicous. It tastes sorta like whipped cream cheese with horseradish. The perfect accompany to this cheesy sandwich with it's sweet carmelized onions.   The tomatoes in my garden salad reminded me of the ones we grow in the backyard during the summer.   The waitstaff service was exceptional."}
{"text":"First of all the food and The service is very good. All our portions seemed generous except for the soup. For some reason the cup $9 and bowl $11 seemed to both be very stingy... We really enjoyed the decor and the atmosphere at Reds most of the food we had was very good.  We loved their soups, the noodle bowl was fantastic, the kale salad lacked flavour and dressing- and the charred salmon was a bit too 'fishy' to me, but my hubby enjoyed it- we also enjoyed the ahi tuna with guacamole, except we both felt it was lacking a little something... either a drizzle of sauce of something- was a tad bland. Our server did a great job, got everything right, was served at a very reasonable time- although our server was also the bar tender he seemed to get very busy closer to the end of our dinner and didn't come around much by the end, no water refills, and we had to search for another server and he basically completed our order, however our original server did come around at the end, to say thank you and bye.. our bill was very reasonable! Considering we had alcoholic drinks, apps and mains! As well as we took some soup to go for the next day.. overall a great place, the food is either amazing or ok... we know now what to stick to, the service was good, and yeh we will be back- but hopefully an $11 cream soup could be a bit of a more generous portion? It was literally half a small container- not cool..."}
{"text":"Passed by this place many times.  Decided tonight was the night.  The place is very nicely set up - open concept very large TV screens and great decor.   Music was good also, not too loud just enough to not hear the people next to you.  Good beer selection (ok that's important to me!). I started with the Crab Chowder - it was delicious!  Followed that up with that butter chicken bowl- it was good - had some kick.  Overall nice place and good food and beer/drink selection in a nice setting"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, full but not overly crowded. Great drinks menu and courtesy matchbook comes with bill. Staff mostly friendly, borderline eager. But also finding their bearings. If you are a fan of O&B, Baton Rouge, etc. You will enjoy highly!!!"}
{"text":"Living in the area, I would consistently walk by this place on a daily basis, and would always admire their patio :p So, for my birthday, I decided to dine here. Ps- i give it a 4.5!  Got a nice, cushioned patio seat, with a huge umbrella to protect from any rain/sun, and a barrier of flowers and plants to provide some privacy from people walking by on the street.    Decided to opt out of getting an app, solely because I wanted to enjoy my main, and I knew I'd be getting dessert on the house, which obviously I wanted to save room for    First we got our drinks, I ordered a maple bacon bourbon; a lot stronger than I anticipated!  Cost $12. For mains, I ordered the pork tenderloin with gnocchi, and my boyfriend chose a peppercorn steak with a side of mashed potatoes.  We also split a tiny side of fries. We waited a reasonable amount of time for our food to come, nothing below or above average.   The quantity of food for me was perfect. Just enough so I could finish it all and not be left overly full! I should warn tou though, I do not have the worlds biggest appetite,  so if you think of yourself as being a big eater, consider ordering an app on top of your meal.  In terms of taste, I really didn't have anything to complain about! The pork was cooked perfectly: nice and tender, not dried out AT ALL! The gnocchi were a little al dente, but I don't mind my pasta being on the harder side. The pasta could've used a liiitttllee more sauce, but no biggy.  The flourless cake went above my expectations!  It came with cashews, a banana and chocolate mousse, and they even wrote \"happy birthday \" in chocolate sauce on the plate they served it to me on!  It was enough for us to share after the meals we just consumed!  Through getting the dessert for free, ended up spending about $60 for both of us before tip. Not too shaby considering we went out with the intention of having a classier/pricier meal.   If you're looking for a place to go out to celebrate a bit more of a special occasion,  I would recommend giving Red's a shot. The ambiance of the place is quite nice (makes you feel like a fancy person for dining there haha), and their menu offers quite a variety of choices,  so you can't really go wrong! :)"}
{"text":"????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"We went twice during our short trip to Toronto and had a great meal both times - unique, creative dishes, but not too avant-garde, sort of innovative approaches to the classics.  Both my son and I were totally pleased with everything we got, from drinks to dessert."}
{"text":"Noticed this place was new and checked it out tonight. Fun place with nice decor and good food!  I had the calamari (excellent) and the pasta carbonara which was quite unique. The food was great and my server Jacqueline was excellent!  (she also has a dazzling smile and cheerful attitude that really made the entire experience exceptional)"}
{"text":"Overall a good time, but I won't be in a hurry to go back.  The restaurant is beautiful and the food quality is excellent.  On the flip side, the prices are on the higher side for food and drinks. The portion sizes of the plates are on the smaller side. The server was friendly but would disappear for periods of time and he didn't know much about drinks (ie bourbon vs scotch). Many beers were out of stock (never seen such a thing).  And then this happened ..  Sadly, the server needed to make 3 trips to correct our 2 bills for a table of 4 and in the end we settled to work it out between us (still wrong). His first try included duplicates of items, essentially double charging.  Our experience certainly fell short of our expectations and this was a 2nd try and 2nd disappointment for a guest in our party."}
{"text":"For an out of Towner this was a very appealing place looked warm and kind and meals were ok on the menu. After sitting down alone and having a short conversation with the person on the next table, I was taken back when invited to join them as we had some common ground as I was from Australia. The wine and food were spot on with no complaints, however the service we both received from the bar/drinks gentleman was perfect he also had common ground from living in Australia for a period of time. It was a very nice night with local people that made me feel very included.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Came today for lunch for the first time. I honestly was very surprised by how delicious my food was. I ordered the wild mushroom soup and when I sipped my first spoonful my eyes widened.  The dish was the best clear broth mushroom soup I have ever had and  67 years old. My grilled cheese was excellent.y 3 friends also had great reviews of their food. I will be back"}
{"text":"Summerlicious dinner $28 + tax Roast Beef yorkies Bbq pork tenderloin Homestyle brownies  The food tastes fine but the pork tenderloin dish was really small not to mention bland. Not worth it. Brownies were pure sugar. Did not like.  A few of my friends ordered sirloin steak and one of them ordered medium well done while the others ordered medium. The server who delivered the dish did not give the correct dish to the person who ordered medium well.  Service was really poor. The restaurant was not packed, yet, it took a really long time to get each course. Our server would basically disappear for a long duration and when and we did see her, she was bussing/serving other tables. We eventually were able to ask for our bill, waited half an hour, she gave it to us then disappeared for another half an hour. We also got an extra bill we did not order. Another table was able to get their bill (after we got ours) and paid ahead of us. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Reds in the financial district and last night, I found myself at the midtown location for the first time.  The service was lovely and attentive, no complaints there.  I ended up ordering off of the summerlicious menu b/c some of the offerings looked delicious.  I started with the quinoa salad with apples and aged cheddar.  This was fantastic - completely exceeded my expectations.  For my main, I ordered a fried chicken dish with beet/cauliflower  salad and this spicy chili sauce.  It was SO spicy, which I enjoyed, but I can imagine it being way too hot for the average person.  The chicken was incredible.  The other 7 people at my table opted for the steak or fish, and many were jealous of my pick.  For dessert, the chocolate pot de creme with chili was a bit of a let down.  Could not taste the chili at all.  I think Reds is simply a good option, anytime.  It's a great place to go if you want food that is a bit more inventive without being too out there.  I love the decor - the glass, leather and wood.  It's really pretty, but not dainty."}
{"text":"Three of us went to Reds due to previous good experiences and good reviews on yelp. It was a Thursday night so Stella's were on for $5. We were seated close to the entrance, but wasn't a big deal for us. Out waiter was great! Really OCD so kept everything in check for us and was checking in at the right times to make sure we were ok with drinks and our food.   We started with the flatbread and calamari. Both were excellent and I would highly recommend. The flat bread had a little bit of a sweet, tangy twist which was a pleasant surprise. At the table, there was crispy chicken, chicken carbonara and I personally had the salmon which was pretty good. Portions were also well sized if you feel like doing a 3-course meal. None of the regular menu dessert items appealed to us, so we asked if we could order some of the winterlicious desserts. Bread pudding was great and had a nice toasted marshmallow topping. The carrot cake had a good spice to it.  Overall, the atmosphere, customer service and DJ provided a great experience and the food was excellent. Highly recommend Reds."}
{"text":"OK. I ordered the steak, it was over cooked, but still tasted good.  My potato had black spots in it, so the server brought me the truffle fries.... YUM.  Overall Ok."}
{"text":"Techno Music Disaster, I think they play the music loud so you can not hear each other complain about the over poor food and average service.  There are much better places to eat in this area.  We will not be back!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! I had the steak and shrimp both of which were very tasty. Service was quick and excellent. Drinks were delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. A little pricey."}
{"text":"Went last night with a table of 14 for a birthday party. Service was decent and we enjoyed the atmosphere. We also sat at their U shaped table which was pretty cool, we could walk to the middle and talk to each other without being in the way of other customers or servers. The food on the other hand, not so great. I ordered the three course meal for $32 and picked the mushroom soup w/truffle oil, 7 Oz sirloin with the apple pie for dessert. Those of us that got the soup all agreed that it was bland. I was trying to play it safe by asking for my steak to be cooked rare but my steak came out medium. The apple pie crust was delicious but I found the apples in the pie a bit sour for my liking. My girlfriend had the Caesar salad, salmon for main and brownie for dessert. The salmon  was surprisingly moist and the skin was nice and crispy, definitely a good choice. Although she loves chocolate... she couldn't finish her brownie cuz it was too sweet. I wouldn't recommend eating there but nice place to just grab drinks and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"The private menu for handmade Gin cocktails is potent and amazing!! The Kale salad is alright but not overwhelming in flavours. The carbonara chicken was amazing! Staff took good care to look after our table and they were even able to dim the lights for us by request. Generally a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Here is what you get with this restaurant, glitzy decor, a nice ambiance and nice hostesses. I'd say it's a place you come to have a drink, share some food to hold you over until dinner and then go somewhere else for dinner.  For a downtown place, the standard for food is set so high now that I expect more. I came with a big group for dinner. We ordered several dishes but really I think the only thing that stood out was the Prince Edward Island mussels. It was a huge portion of mussels in a great white wine broth. I do like the bowl it came in with a rack to push the mussels to one side so I can get to the broth at the bottom when I start. Other than that, nothing else seemed that great here.  The service wasn't that great. He was helpful at beginning but then seemed to disappear at times. Once when an item of food came, another server brought it, then hesitated, took it away saying \"sorry, this is not for you. is it?\" awkward. And the appetizers came like five minutes apart. awkward.  I did like the light fixtures, so at least the millions of dollars spent on decor was well spent. I'd say this is the type of place you might want to head to for drinks and some snacks after work. Perhaps if work is paying. They got some nice shareable foods and lots of drinks. The prices are overpriced but if someone else is paying it ain't so bad. It's a big place so it's relaxing."}
{"text":"We were walking by and your $5 Gin and Tonic ad got our attention so we decided to try it. Great decision.  The food was very good. My wife had Marsala butter chicken and I got the 1/2 rack of ribs. The service was also excellent. Our waiter Greg was very good and ably assisted by Jake.  The manager Dennis also stopped by for a quick chat. All were very friendly, attentive to our needs and always smiling.  They made the evening enjoyable, more than just a meal, a great experience.  Oh ya, the gin and tonic was good too."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and had wine and entrees. I wish they have nicer sitting areas that are more comfortable. However, the wine, fish and steak were all nice. The salmon was one of the best I've had. It had a really nice crispy crust that is similar to pork rinds. My only complaint is that one of the servers kept walking by giving me dirty looks. Doesn't she get treated out? Sucks to be her. My server was also the bartender. He was professional and prompt 88% of the time."}
{"text":"Cool place a lot of choices on drinks besides being close to our hotel. Menu is well done on choices to grab some or eat well...not pricy either and staff very friendly and of course my favorite \"clean\""}
{"text":"Great food excellent service.  Had chicken carbonara dish with pasta and poached  egg in middle.  Music was good,  and place was Comfortable.  Thanks and props to my waitress   Jacqueline.  Oh and beers..  Yum"}
{"text":"Started with the calamari fritti and was pleasantly surprised with the battered and fried lemon slices. The slices explode with flavour and go well the calamari.  The pork tenderloin was flavourful and portion size was perfect. The gnocchi accompanying the tenderloin almost stole the show. The gnocchi was pleasantly spicy and the pan fry gave them a nice texture.  The bacon cheeseburger is a little pricey but I would order it again in a heartbeat. The bun is fresh baked and the burger almost melts in your mouth. The menu advertised a knife and fork Caesar salad however I received a standard boring Caesar. The salad was much too small and lacked flavour.  Cocktails! Margarita was terrific, I would have ordered another one however I wanted to try the maple bacon bourbon Manhattan. The Maple did not disappoint however I would have liked a bigger piece of bacon on the stir stick. The Caesar (cocktail) was delicious and the olive and kielbasa were a great accompaniment.  Service was only ok. We came early in the evening and the place was almost empty. It took a long time to get drinks and longer for refills. Empty plates and glasses were not cleared as quick as I would have liked. Our server explained that he didn't like the look of the cheeseburger so the kitchen did it again. Appreciated that bc the burger was excellent.  Overall it was great experience, decor was nice and I enjoyed the comfy chairs."}
{"text":"I had to try out Reds for Summerlicious! It was a 3 course lunch for $18. This was a very large restaurant with abundant seating, no reservation needed at the time. We were delightfully seated outside on the courtyard patio.  For appetizers, we had the tuna tostadas and crunchy Asian slaw. Both were very good. Great portion on the salad!  I ordered the Curry and it came with some fresh veggies, naan, and rice. This dish was ok, not flavourful enough. It was unpleasant to find some pieces of crunchy rice. I wouldn't order it again.   The dessert was a strawberry cheesecake in a mason jar. This was excellent, I enjoyed the simplicity of the dish: a layer of strawberry topping, cheesecake-like filling and graham cracker crust at the bottom. It tasted delicious.  The servers constantly refilled our glasses of water and they were friendly. We waited a bit longer than usual for our food to arrive.  By the end of the meal, we were stuffed. It was nice to try, dessert was definitely my favourite part."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for drinks and appetizers in the bar area.  The location is large, yet feels intimate.  The decor has a very rustic feeling.    I've tried the burgers which were very juicy.  The potato bread was good, but a bit too much balsamic for me.  The edamame was good, but it's pretty hard to screw that up.  And the Yucatan crevice was excellent.  The lobster guacamole was only okay, not work the price in my opinion.    Good atmosphere.  Good wine selection.  Friendly and attentive service. Would come back."}
{"text":"Nice vibe.  Faux worn batten board graces a snake-like centre bar.  Dining tables at the back and upstairs.  The front looks out on the corner of Yonge and Gerrard in what used to be a parking lot, now home to one of the largest high-rise condo developments in Canada.  Large flat screens adorn the bar area, making it serviceable though not ideal for watching the game.  Can't speak to food, though I hear it was good. My only attestation can come from the candied pecans homemade and served around the bar.  Cocktails come with the trendy giant ice block instead of cubes.  A decent bourbon list, though I confess I am more of a Scotch guy.  Beers on tap are of the macro-micro variety: Spearhead Breweries Hawaiian Pale Ale amongst my personal favourites.  A good place to go for the after work crowd; not sure about it as a dining destination."}
{"text":"Great experience at Red's! I went on a Sunday night with my girlfriend. We got seated right away and the service was great. The food was also excellent - we ordered the wings appetizer, which came in a buffalo butter sauce. I ordered the Chicken Carbonara, and my girlfriend ordered the Stockton St. Club Sandwich. We were both very impressed with the food - very tasty. Aside from that, the place was absolutely beautiful inside. Classy, unique and designed very well. The name definitely doesn't fit the vibe, it is not what you would picture when you hear \"Red's Tavern\" (at least, I didn't). I'd definitely come back my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Five stars for this place might be a bit excessive,  but here are my excuses....  I came during Summerlicious at lunch with a large group (please let all those words sink in for a moment) and....  1. Not only did the food not seem like a scant, bland version of some better menu, it was delicious and generous. The quinoa salad was superb, but better than that was the fried chicken, which unlike all fried chicken in Toronto, was not too salty, greasy, and overdone. Everyone at my table thoroughly enjoyed their lunch, which is damn hard to do with a big group. 2. The service was excellent. Sure, a big restaurant that has large tables should know how to serve groups, maybe. Here, they actually do. The climactic moment of all group service- bringing and splitting the bill- went off without a hitch. The servers acted as if it were perfectly normal and easy to split a cheque. Imagine that!  Hats off to Reds for a great lunch."}
{"text":"Attended a winterlicious lunch. $18 for 3 courses. I ordered, and enjoyed:  Tuna Tostadas Steak Bibimbap. (steak slices are pretty obvious. the bibimbap component was ok. Could have used more sauce. This handily beat my expectations of mediocrity) Toffee Cake w Vanilla ice cream  (Shrimp Ravioli was good too. It comes with a piece of shrimp on top of each of the 4-5 pieces of ravioli)  Simple and good. The prices were quite reasonable.  I probably wouldn't rush back outside of winterlicious, because I prefer ethnic restaurants.  However, I would return for happy hour, considering it was pretty great during the yelp event which was hosted here a couple of years ago"}
{"text":"I went to Reds for dinner once. The restaurant is huge and I saw a large group of office people celebrating a birthday and there were also some families having dinner. It has a nice vibe and the location is excellent.    The food was alright but the food took long to get to the table. I had the chicken carbonara and it was pretty big but not that delicious, so I decided to try a dessert. I had the mint and chocolate mousse, but I couldn't finish it because it was too thick and filling. I went there with 2 friends and none of them finished their desserts either. Don't get me wrong, the taste was good but the consistency was just too thick. It would have been a better idea to share the dessert.   I think it looks like a good spot for drinks after work and for that, I'd go back. Also because they have a nice long patio."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails and wine list to pair with delicious food especially the Carbonara ! Kamilla working at the bar is an absolute delight. She makes your experience special every time."}
{"text":"Reds is a stable of college park area, catering to many events and dinner parties. Having been there multiple times and sampling most of the menu, here is what I think of it after all these visits.  The good: The interior! Reds interior is both beautiful and inviting. It's trendy look is definitely on par with high end dining spaces such as Joey's and Cactus club. It features both a nicely lit interior and also a patio area right outside on Yonge street. The gin & tonic selection is also something to rave about, offering creative options that are both delicious and out of the ordinary. Appetizers are also great sharables with great flavour, offering bold flavour that is a great start to a meal. My favourites are the sticky ribs and the lettuce cups.  The bad: Quite recently, the best appetizers on the menu are nowhere to be found. Instead, the newly offered appetizers is just a small set (and quite frankly typical) of appetizers that is offered at any restaurant. Furthermore, Reds used to be a prime location for quality steaks at a good price point. Unfortunately, they've increased the price slightly, putting it in the range of every other wine bars. For what it's worth, the steaks are cooked well.  The ugly: On my last visit, either our order was backlogged, or it was simply forgotten. It took an extremely long time to receive the main course. While the waitress was attentive to our order, there should be no reason that it takes over 40 minute plus for our order, despite semi filled restaurant.  Here's the thing about reds...it is respectable chain restaurant that serve fantastic appetizers and drinks while focuses on offering a great experience. But it simply does not exceed beyond all the other restaurants of this calibre. While they were something special at one point, they've simply conformed to the status quo."}
{"text":"Can you feel that? The immensity of all those souls resting above you? 78 storeys of young urbanites, with all their hopes and dreams and turmoil...  Well, rest easy! The beer selection down here on the ground floor of the Aura tower is top drawer!  Minus one star as the service was a bit absent.  Will update once I actually eat something here."}
{"text":"The problem with bar/restaurant hybrids downtown has always been the scale of extremes. Its either comfortably on one side of the scale, in the cheap student / sports bar / terrible food / so loud you have to yell or its on the completely opposite side, the uncomfortably full of Bay St. suits / expensive amazing food / good luck getting service if you're there for dinner side. Reds Midtown Tavern sits perfectly in the middle of this scale and it glorious.  Made a reservation for an annual get together of old friends, never having gone before I was depending completely on a friends' recommendation and he was not wrong (he never is), the place is fantastic. We sat in the area to the left of the bar (which I think is the lounge but I may be wrong) with the nice comfortable leather high-back chairs, had food and drinks for about five hours and it is now my new favourite place. The location is good, close to subway and the downtown in general. The staff is super friendly and more than happy to recommend dishes which where right on point. Reds Midtown is comfortable without being a pub yet has food as good if not better than some of the higher end Bay St. restaurants, its like a Unicorn and you should definitely take a ride.   The only downside is that I could see how it could be noisy on busier days. We went on a Tuesday night and it was pretty noisy at 7:00pm but started to get quieter around 9pm. Other than that the ambiance is very warm and welcoming, it is a neutral meeting point for 9-5'ers, suits and creatives alike."}
{"text":"This place looks and seems like a pretty cool bar, but for meals... this place blows. We got seated and got menus, but after 15 minutes had to wave down a bartender walking by just to get waters. Then we had to get up and ask someone if we had a waiter to take our meal order.. When the food finally got to us, it was boring and basic blah food.. and we were STARVING.  I feel like this is the type of place that if I told someone from Toronto I ate there, they would say \"What? they serve food there?  I thought it was a bar/lounge\""}
{"text":"I love this place.   There is something on the menu for everyone.  Staff are professional, friendly and happy to be there.  This place consistently refreshes their menu, upgrades the dining room and improves service."}
{"text":"I stop in here at least once every trip to t-dot.  reliable quality and nice ambiance.  a little pricey"}
{"text":"Great food, tried the oyster and halibut. The drinks are very delicious as well. Great ambience , good for groups and for dates ."}
{"text":"I went there to try their summerlicious lunch. It was $18 for the 3-course dinner which included appetizer, main course and dessert. I selected candied salmon, trout, and apple pie with vanilla ice cream as my three courses. The candied salmon tasted like smoke salmon but a bit sweeter, and it was a bit dry. The trout was so juicy and the skin was crispy. But the fish portion was not big. And I don't like the vegetables and potato salad on side. The potato salad tasted sour. I don't know whether they used vinegar or something else as the sauce. I really like the apple pie with vanilla ice cream! Cold  and hot at the same time! I can't complain anything on the dessert.   Each portion was small, but I still will recommend this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in such a beautiful space. I love the light fixtures! We had a reservation for 10, which was acknowledged upon arrival. Our server (who looked like Katy Perry) was informative of both the food and drink menu. Extensive beer selection and standard wine list. There are unique large gin based drinks, reasonably priced ($10-$13). I had the ceviche as a starter and oscar sirloin with fully loaded potato. The ceviche was alright and the portion was small--6-7 chips topped with ceviche for $13 was steep. I had hoped there was more toppings, as my potato was bare after 3 bites. The highlight of my meal was undoubtedly the steak; cooked perfectly rare and of quality. The other girls at my table also commented on how great their steaks were, and how we would come back for it. The sticky toffee dessert ($7) was small but really good. Do NOT order the flourless chocolate cake; the texture and taste resembles canned icing with a caramelized banana on top. All in all, a beautiful atmosphere with reasonably priced drinks, good food (depending on what you order), and nice service."}
{"text":"I ordered the Goat Cheese & Beet Salad to start ($16.45). Our server was kind enough to inform us the salad is mostly arugula in the middle and the goat cheese and beets are around the edge, it's not all tossed together. The salad was still tasty but a little pricey for what it was.  I ordered the Brixton Burger with truffle fries for my entree ($18.10). This burger was really good, and the fries were good too.  My boyfriend ordered the half rack BBQ Pork Ribs with truffle fries ($22.60). He said the ribs were tender and flavourful.  Our server was nice enough to bring a Lemon Brûlée Cheesecake with \"Happy Birthday\" written on the plate for my bf and I for dessert. This dessert is DELICIOUS. I highly recommend this dessert!   Last night was the first time I'd been here, my boyfriend and I came for part 2 of his birthday celebration. I called to make a reservation a month ago and requested a booth in the dining room. I called earlier this week to confirm the reservation. I called yesterday morning and confirmed AGAIN, and made sure we were able to get a booth in the dining room. When we got there, the host ended up sitting us in the bar. I told her I called multiple times to request to sit in the dining room, and she was nice enough to accommodate. We had to wait 40 minutes but at least we finally ended up sitting in the dining room.   Other than that inconvenient start to the night, this place is really nice. The inside of this restaurant is classy and has a good vibe.  Our server (didn't catch her name) was great, super attentive and honest while recommending dishes. Our server made our time here enjoyable and made up for that inconvenient start  Overall this place is nice, the food is good, and the staff are friendly. I recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Super busy, lively restaurant bar. The food is decent given the price. Seating is not the most comfortable. My biggest issue is just with how insanely loud it is inside--it makes trying to have a conversation very difficult without having to raise your voice. Service is ok."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the mediocre reviews for Reds. But based on my many visits here, I would definitely give it a 3.5.   The last time I was here, my server was great. We had a party of 8 and he and others constantly topped up our waters, checked on our drinks and had our food come out in a timely manner even though throughout the night we were snacking on apps. I had their $38 three course meal. The mushroom soup - delicious, but I thought the portion was a bit small. I had the steak for the main and I thought this was okay. It was done a bit rare but I asked for medium. Finally the dessert came. I ordered apple pie with the vanilla ice cream but I didn't like the pie. It tasted like a store bought piece of pie, and wasn't warm. I was a bit disappointed. The only good item was the ice cream.  I'd have to say I do like coming to Reds for drinks. They have a bunch of drink specials after 5 but they need to step up their food game."}
{"text":"I love the decor.... Great service and fantastic food... Next time I'll be in Toronto I'll definitely come back... Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"YUM! I stopped into Reds Midtown Tavern with a friend while I was staying in Toronto. It was a Friday night at about 6:30pm and we were surprised to see that we could be seated right away. I started my meal with a Sangria and I ordered the Turkey Club which was soooooo good! My friend ordered a burger and we both paid three dollars extra to upgrade our side to sweet potato fries. The fries came with a horseradish mustard dipping sauce which I didn't love but the fries themselves were great.   The reason I couldn't give Reds 5 stars was because of the service. Our server brought our food and then we never saw him again until we flagged him down for some ketchup. After that, he was gone again until we asked someone to find him so we could pay the bill. I would definitely return for the food, but hopefully we have a different server next time."}
{"text":"I just love this place. When I'm in Toronto a visit is a must. Naturally the music is too loud to have a good conversation - but the place is just 'full of life'. I like the barkeeper brining out the ordered beer personally - and also the Somalier if you order wine. The food is really good - I like the shareables very much. Today I  just had mussels with some fries (as a side) - just delicious."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior and dining area but that's about it. What bothered me during my dinner here was how appalling the service was. The server took forever to come to our table to place our orders. Our order took forever to get to our table too. And finally it took about half an hour after we asked for the bill for them to finally bring it to us. And we had to ask twice. The portion of food to the price is also very bad. I really cannot believe this place charges so much for mediocre food and non existent service."}
{"text":"The first time I started dining here was due to summerlicious. My friends and I all loved their summerlicious menu. Everything they serve was absolutely delicious. The flavours were just right and the steaks were perfectly cooked. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside yet juicy on the inside. The pan seared trout was nicely seasoned and not overcooked. As for dessert it was alright. Service was excellent.   Visited this place a few times after that and even held my birthday party here. Food was alright but not as good as my summerlicious experience. We had a semi private table closer to the back of the restaurant. Service was still good. My friends brought a cake to cut there and there was a cake cutting fee. Forgot how much though.   During my other visits, some of the things that stood out the most is the butter chicken. The butter chicken (16.95) is one of the best I've tried. It tasted rich and flavourful. I seemed very authentic. It was so good that my brown friend even thought it was really authentic for a restaurant that doesn't specialize in this type of cuisine. Portion size of it was pretty small though.   The chicken carbonara ($19.99) was not that good. It wasn't as flavourful as expected. Seemed like something was missing.   Lobster sirloin - I think it was a 7oz sirloin with lobster bits, mash potatoes and veggies. Not worth it. Felt like it was overprice. It was topped with really little lobster bits for an extra i think $8. You're better off going with a regular sirloin for cheaper.   Peppercorn steak ($34.95) - 11oz New York steak. This one was okay but nothing special. A little overcooked. The sauce was good though.  The decor is pretty simple and the lighting is pretty dim. It's pretty good for a romantic date.   Washrooms are located upstairs. The washrooms nice and clean.   Overall, okay place. Something's are reasonably priced but others are a little overpriced for the portion they give."}
{"text":"And suddenly, this new Red's location came up....  Overall, still the same chain vibe going on.  No matter how they try to disguise it, it's a Sircorp restaurant afterall - so you know your sauces dressing etc are coming out of efficient little bags and food pre prepped and shipped to the tim horton par bake level.   However, location wise, this place is great - atmosphere wise - it's an update to what's currently out there. Compared to Moxies, Keg, Milestones - Red's is definitely the winner.  Just don't expect gourmet food here."}
{"text":"We take our clients here for drinks as they've just opened a patio here a few weeks ago. Good wine list by the glass and great wine list by the bottle. Interesting decor and a corporate vibe. One of my favorite healthy dishes is the cabbage chicken rolls. It comes with a peanut sauce and red chili pepper paste. Ive also had a quinoa salad and added chicken - again great dish and good portion sizes."}
{"text":"This place is large and has a classy feel.   Great for a glass of wine or cocktail.  Terrible if you are a vegetarian. No vegetarian main option. A few appetizers are vegetarian (maybe two or three). I do not recommend this place for dinner if there is a vegetarian in your group."}
{"text":"Just arrived in to Toronto this evening for one night. Not sure what to eat so I took a walk since i was sitting down for the last 8 hours. Using my Yelp app I came across Reds. Lots of choices in the area. Can only say I made the right choice. Great decor, lighting, music in the background and great staff. See below. As a self proclaimed Margarita snob it's not often I have a Margarita worth recommending. Kudos to Adaina for a great drink. I went for a light meal, the Lobstah Guacamole appetizer with a double on the Guac!  Make time to visit Reds when in Toronto.  Adaina Bar Manager  Greg Bartender"}
{"text":"Went here because I really wanted the two bite butter tarts. I had them at the square one location and figured since I was down in the city I would fulfill the craving. I was extremely disappointed when the waitress informed me that they had no longer carried them.   None the less my family and I decided to stay and eat. We ordered a few small plates to share since we were just trying to have a light lunch.   Wild Mushroom Soup - This was delicious and the highlight of my meal. The truffles did not over take the taste and smell of the soup itself. The consistency of the soup remained the same throughout, which is something I appreciate. Sometimes you can get the feeling of the different types of mushrooms in which they put into the soup because they are all cute differently. This however did not have that feeling.  Calamari Fritti - It kind of looked like they just threw the calamari haphazardly onto the plate. The dish itself was not anything special to be honest. The batter was not evenly on the calamari, perhaps got lost in the cooking process...  Truffle Fries - They were good, can not really complain because truffle fries are pretty much the same everywhere.  Angus Beef Sliders - These were yummy bite size burgers. One order comes with three so we ordered another single just to make it a complete four set. Small pickle, cooked nicely and the bun was not soggy.   Ravioli and Garlic Shrimp -This was good however one MAJOR downfall was the tail on the shrimp was still on... That threw me completely off when I cut into my ravioli with the shrimp and took a bite. That was a no beuno..  Overall nothing was really outstanding for me to come back. I would probably go to the square one location so I can get my butter tarts while I am there."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. We got seated but no menu, no server, no drinks and no service. Nearby tables weren't being served either. Eventually we left without seeing a menu. Really odd. Reds in First Canadian Place is really good but the midtown place doesn't seem to be trying."}
{"text":"I'm at different restaurants daily with my job. Reds has a great atmosphere and amazing staff"}
{"text":"Came here on a college visit. Staff was really friendly and told us about some places to check out in the city. Food came out in decent time. My brother got the butter chicken which was so so good. I tried some and sort of wished I got it myself. I got the chicken carbonara. Egg was poached well and the dish tasted really well overall. Felt more like a pasta dish though.  Overall, we had a great experience!"}
{"text":"I'm really happy I stumbled upon Reds!  We were walking up Yonge assuming that one again we would end up at Elephant and Castle when... REDS APPEARED!  Apparently they've been there since October, so I must have been overlooking them for the last few months, but finally the stars aligned and I popped in for a drink.  I do like the decor, although it is the typical \"trendy\" look, with Edison bulbs, recycled wood and concrete elements. It is a very LARGE space, including two private dining spaces, so I can see that it will be a great spot for stopping by after a movie for a drink, since I can't really imagine it filling up.  NOW - to the four star element - the service was prompt and polite, but the cocktails were kind of MEH.   I understand that it's a wine bar, so I probably should have gone with wine, but they had a delicious and long cocktail list (that was reasonably priced!) so I couldn't resist. I tried the Ginger Rogers (never again!) and their Negroni, which was decent but a little unbalanced.   I will definitely be back for food and will update accordingly!"}
{"text":"Who is the chef, really? I had an excellent dish of Butter Chicken Bowl. It comes with naan bread and basmati rice. My fiancé loved his Chicken Tacos and baked potato side, as well. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable with nice decor. There is a large variety of food and drink options, ranging from salads, sandwiches, chicken, steak and fish. The prices seem reasonable. The wait staff are professional. It seems like a great place to meet up with friends for food or drinks; or watch some games on TV or hang out with your special someone. Awesome vibe, I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"For a place that looks pretty fancy I was disappointed by the service and decor here. I came here with my hubby on a Monday afternoon for lunch. I had ordered the sliders and asked for there to be no sauce, or toppings of any kind due to my allergies. But when my order came it came with cheese. So I had to send it back. When the food came back the sliders tasted decent. They weren't the most delicious or the worst I'd had, just in the middle. The sliders also came with a little tiny side of fries. It was really only about 5 pieces of french fries. I had to laugh as it looked a bit ridiculous. Hubby had the mini yorkies and thai nachos. He said his food tasted good but the mini yorkies deflated. He said the nachos were messy. But I think nachos are messy by nature anyway as you eat them with your hands. So I'm not sure what hubby means by that. LOL.  Anyway service was kind of mediocre too. The waitress serving us was very quiet and it could be hard to hear her over the music. The other wait staff who brought our food was okay. I'm not sure I would eat here again. Most of the good reviews seem to be for dinner time meals. We probably would have been better off at Elephant & Castle across the street."}
{"text":"As a young barrister  I often visited Red's older, fancier sibling further downtown. Now a seasoned public servant I prefer things a bit more casual, a bit less expensive, and a lot less pretentious.   While Yonge and Gerrard is hardly \"midtown\" in my book, this Reds outpost has managed to downscale somewhat while keeping food quality high and prices at the upper end of affordable.   The room itself is huge; taking up a quadrant of the Aura condo behemoth. Decor is standard vague industrial; poured concrete and reclaimed wood and exposed metal. Nothing we haven't seen before, but done to reasonable effect here. There are a few odd design flourishes: a (non-working) retro cigarette vending machine at the front, and back-lit curios throughout filled with tchatchkes like sunglasses and lighters and keychains.   I'm deducting half a star for inconveniently-located washrooms. Unless you nab the accessible unisex guy on the main floor (in plain view of everyone-HEY MA!!! LOOK!!! I'M GONNA PEE!!!) you're running up a few flights of stairs and through a busy alcove.   I'll take another quarter-star for the mix of seating. Dining with a small party, we get comfy chairs on tables. As part of an office party, we are directed to a horseshoe of high stools around an elbow-level counter. Let me be clear: I hate the whole high-stool thing. I hate not being able to comfortably slide my chair into dining position under the table. I dislike feeling like I'm teetering during my meal, and while I'm hardly short, I resent feeling like I need a boost to sit in my high chair. This particular seating arrangement also puts one far enough away from the diner directly across from you that you can't make out a goddamn word.   The last half-star I deduct is for wait times. Reds proudly proclaims it's a scratch kitchen, which is admirable. At lunch hour, it's a liability. I've never been during a work emergency, but if I did I'd be back on my horse to the office before I even received my menu. I imagine Reds is designed with local office workers in mind...so a few quicker options would be helpful.  It's hard to find fault with the food itself. A luncheon steak frites arrives hot and done to a perfect char outside with a bleeding medium.rare heart. The potatoes are a cooked  few shades beyond amber, and shatteringly crisp. I could do without the gratuitous bitter raw greens, which I suspect are meant as garnish...I just usually eat everything on my plate (see: mint leaves at dessert).   A return visit yields tender butter chicken, a bit spicier than expected (I usually expect the Indian equivalent of Big Mac Sauce) sided with rice and naan. I'd gladly trade one of the starches for a second veggie curry-saag paneer or chana masala or even roald daal. As it is, the only veg in the house is a fair bit of coarsley chopped onion. There are also appetizers; fries and dips, and beet hummus (which tastes better than it sounds, but is unremarkable).   A warm, custom-baked apple pie with ice cream is the highlight.   Coffee is strong and refilled frequently.   Sometimes, a little bit downscale is just right."}
{"text":"I always come by this place on my fist night visiting Toronto.   Their lamb shrank is very delicious and it is well paired with the housemate mash grits   I also high recommend the carrot cake ... It is so so so delicious :-)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, mainly for some late night drinks and snacks. Both times were seated inside. They have a street patio, but it is pretty close to a lot of construction and traffic. The service is pretty friendly and approachable. Friday nights are arguably the best nights to go, especially if you're a gin & tonic fan. They have $8 crafted G&Ts, which normally go for $11+. They are doubles served in an impressively sized, snow-globe of a glass. If you decide to craft your own G&T, they have a DIY menu where you can pick your own gin, tonic, and garnish.   The place is gorgeous and spacious, and atmosphere is calm and inviting. Great place to have drinks and apps with your friends."}
{"text":"Just a summerlicious review. I tried:  Candied salmon: pretty dish, flavours are good, I think I can recommend this starter. I enjoyed it.  Roast beef grilled cheese: So greasy but actually kinda got sick of eating it. I think it needed something other than the horseradish aioli to cut thru the grease.  Lavender creme brulee: for some reason I tasted no lavender, and there wasnt a hard, carmelized layer on top to break through it was just brown and soft on top. Not sure about this execution. Don't recommend this.  One of the great things about Red's is the service and the restaurant itself is a nice environment to chill in and eat. But I would stick to the regular menu."}
{"text":"I came on an evening business trip and it was a great place to seat and eat at the bar while watching a baseball game. The steak I had was excellent. Friendly service also."}
{"text":"I had a chance to eat here for lunch and was very impressed. I have been to Reds in First Canadian Place several times and the Midtown location is consistent with that quality. The look is hip, trendy and relaxing. More importantly, the food was so delicious that I had to consciously remind myself not to scarf it all down quickly as it was a business luncheon.   100% recommend and great to have something of quality in the immediate area."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in the food and serivice.  I came here for a birthday dinner last Friday with a group of about 15.  My boyfriend and I walked into the restaurant greeted by an unwelcoming, bored looking hostess - would it kill you to at least say hello?  We saw our friends immediately, so we seated ourselves.  It took the waitress 10 minutes to acknowledge that we came, and another 10 minutes to get my water and my boyfriend's pint of Canadian.  As someone who has had years of experience in the service industry, I would understand if the restaurant was busy, but it was already past 8PM - the dinner rush was over and the restaurant was quiet.  As for the food - I had the mini sliders (meat was dry, portion was ridiculously small even for sliders, overall, BLAND) and my boyfriend had the turkey club which was extremely soggy.  The cherry on top to the disgusting food and lack of service was the 18% gratuity that was charged to our table - my BIGGEST pet peeve is when servers give their tables shitty service just because of the auto gratuity they charge groups.  My boyfriend ended up paying over $50 for crappy mini sliders, a soggy turkey club and a pint of Canadian.  Save your money - GO SOMEWHERE ELSE."}
{"text":"Good Spicy Caesars but a bit too much vodka and it's a bit more expensive than other bars (Frog and Firkin has awesome Spicy Caesars for less than $6. It was around $9 here). Patio is nice in the summer."}
{"text":"We decided to have dinner in the outside dining area of Reds Midtown Tavern because it was a lovely Toronto night. But I have to mention how very beautiful the inside remodel was from the ceilings to the bar. It's classy, with a lot of ambiance, but also exudes the energy and fun of a great Tavern!  The Food! Was excellent! My Salmon was FRESH with truly crispy skin and other guests marveled over the half chicken which they said was delicious and truly a half chicken. Portions were generous and appreciated!  Their Manhattan was mixed to perfection as were the other drinks ordered during dinner. They missed the 5th star only because they had new wait staff that made a few amateur mistakes. But I have to mention how great looking the entire staff was. Really! But what made it really good was they had the personalities that made for a great experience.   Our favorite of the staff was the \"queen\" of them all and also shared great suggestions for entertainment to follow dinner! Good times! Great Food! Great Place!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice for an affordable restaurant. The chicken tacos dish was smaller than you would think (it was cheap though), but it was decently filling with the loaded baked potato and was pretty tasty. Service was efficient and not intrusive either. This is actually a pretty great chain restaurant in terms of the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was on Friday August 1st for our date night and we had a great time.  The service was great and very attentive.  The G&T's are good but a little pricey for my liking - although it didn't stop me from ordering two!  The food was delicious: we started with the crispy potato flat bread and ceviche; and the cioppino for my main.  All were very flavorful I would recommend.  My only compliant would be that there isn't a lot to choose from on the menu for dinner.  Definitely a good spot for drinks and apps!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad service. I think every course had a mistake. Friendly staff, just poorly trained. I'd return but with very low expectations."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom for a light afternoon snack & some chitchat. The vibe in this place is everything you would want it to be - dim, not too loud, classy. They also have so many interesting interior design elements going on!  The service was very very friendly as well!  We ordered one AAA Beef Sirloin salad & a Thai Slaw salad to share. It was more than enough for both of us to share! Out of the two, I enjoyed the beef sirloin salad more (probably because of my medium rare steak), plus the sauce was interesting :)  Will definitely return again for some kind of function! :)  P.S. Please expand your dessert menu ;)"}
{"text":"It was pretty good. I ordered the steak salad,  was a good dish, but not surprisingly good. Also if the salad was mixed already with the sauce before it comes up, it will be better. The pasta was actually great, and the small cheeseburgers were cute and delicious. Service were good, and patient. Overall nice, might return, but will order something else next time!"}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere, good service, mediocre food. I was here with some co-workers for lunch today, and the cool rustic decor (check out the chandelier made out of wine bottles and glasses!) and friendly hostess/servers gave me high hopes that the food would be just as great. Sadly, that was not the case.   The five of us shared the steamed edamame and tavern butcher board. Both appetizers were good, but nothing too memorable. I ordered the Oscar Sirloin for my entree because it sounded amazing (steak topped with lobster, crab & shrimp, sauteed in tabasco butter, hollandaise sauce and chives), but it was pretty underwhelming. I had asked for it medium rare, and it was more on the medium well side, and a little too charred for my liking. The seafood that came with it wasn't very fresh and tasted inconsistent (some bites were really salty and fishy, others weren't). The side of mash potatoes were decent and tasted pretty good with the hollandaise. The tabasco butter gave everything a bit of a spicy kick.   Definitely won't be rushing back for their food, but it seems like a fun place to catch up with friends over drinks and apps!"}
{"text":"Calm environment but long wait for our food, by the time my food got to the table I found a small strand of hair in my chicken so the kitchen had to obviously remake it for me (which didn't end up taking that long).   One thing that stood out to me was that the restaurant hired a magician and his tricks kept my friends and I busy and our attention away from how long the dinner wait time was."}
{"text":"Such a great spot.  Service is almost always exceptional, except when there is a crowd and even then it's very good.    Food is reasonably priced and very good.  Drinks are excellent, sit at the bar and enjoy a well made beverage, really hard to have a bad experience."}
{"text":"Headed to Red's Tavern for a Wednesday post-work lady date. I arrived before my friend, and instead of making me wait, the hostess sat me at a table and took my name, so my friend wouldn't have any trouble finding me - nice touch!  As for the food, apparently I'm really into Calamari these days, and Red's was on par. Not amazing, HAVE to order it next time I go, but solid. The crispy potato flatbread, on the other hand, was delicious and substantially more decadent than I expected - the dough kinda reminded me of a savory funnel cake. Would definitely order again!  Ordered two $5 beer specials (I think it was Creemore on a Wednesday - my memory is terrible), 2 glasses of wine, and two appys. Our bill came to about $30 each, including tip. Not bad for a nice Wednesday girl's night."}
{"text":"Delicious food - horrible service. Waitress looked like she was new or maybe just started but that's not an excuse for not listening to anything we tried to ask her or correct what she got wrong."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff. Decor is out of this world. Went there for drinks, no food. Stayed for a few hours. Really enjoyable."}
{"text":"I came here for an evening meal the other day, and it was pretty good!  From the bar, I started off with a Pimm's & Lemonade, which was very flavorful. The bartender definitely knew their stuff. The drink selection is great, if you're into gin and tonic. They have a ton of make-your-own options and I bet one could spend hours there mixing and matching flavors. They also provided great descriptions of the flavors in their drinks, which was nice as I am a newbie when it comes to bars.  To eat I had a classic Fish and Chips meal with cole slaw. The slaw was a bit of a twist from the regular slaw I am used to, and that's a good thing! It had a bit of a spicy taste. The chips were good and well-seasoned. Not overpoweringly salty. The batter-dipped fried cod was served crispy and piping hot with classic tartar sauce. I was a bit let down by the flavor of the fish itself. It was unfortunately pretty bland, and I had to dip the pieces of fish with tartar sauce and the slaw.  The decor was lovely inside, with a really neat set of beer bottle light fixtures and cozy -yet a bit cumbersome- leather arm chairs. However, the music was extremely loud and distracting. I had trouble hearing my waitress over the booming speakers.  I would probably go back and order a burger or one of their nice looking salads. Additionally, I would try to get outdoor seating to avoid the clatter inside."}
