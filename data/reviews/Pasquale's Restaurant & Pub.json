{"text":"Finally found a great Italian restaurant near home. Kori was a great server & the Garbage Spaghetti & mozzarella cheese sticks will bring us back. Great beer selection!"}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing!  Ambience is great. Second time there, Nikki remembered our drink orders... felt like \"Norm\" on CHEERS =)"}
{"text":"Loved it. Service was awesome...we had the garbage spaghetti & lasagna. Both were delicious & large portions. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in on a whim tonight, and very glad we did. The wings were perfectly cooked in the house sauce and the spaghetti with meat sauce was amazing and enough for two. Service was very friendly and attentive. Great family atmosphere! We can't wait to come back and try the other yummy looking menu items ."}
{"text":"Awesome service and knowledgeable servers. Pizza was delish. They serve by the slice as well, which makes it very affordable. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service. Waiter recommended the \"poutine\" for an appetizer, and it was addicting! Pizza was average, but overall everything else was impressive so will definitely be back to try pasta and for more poutine. Also, good craft beer selection."}
{"text":"The fried pickles were great! The garlic knot and chicken for the chicken parmesan were rubbery, tasted like they had been reheated in the microwave. Will not be back"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The garlic knots were so delicious. The were soft and tasted like they were freshly made. I ordered the 12\" supreme pizza. It was delicious. Just the right amount of toppings and the sauce was flavorful. The crust was cooked to perfection. My wife had the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the Alfredo was creamy and flavorful. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had good reviews so me and the kids went after games today. We had salads, pizza, and a sausage sub. All of it was good. Sub had plentiful peppers and onions. Plenty of beer choices and the prices are about average. The staff was as friendly and efficient as everyone says. We live a long way from here but we'll be back if in the area again."}
{"text":"Huge hot subs, crispy fries or sweet potato fries are delicious.  Tried the pretzel appetizer and it was good too.  Nice area to sit outside, nice bar to watch tv.   Food was good, the grilled chicken hot sub is tender served on a awesome fresh bread.   Really good food and service."}
{"text":"The wings are excellent because they are crispy with not too much sauce. They are served in a dish with sauce on the bottom so you can get them as set as you want. My wife and I like the salads because the veggies are fresh and meats are excellent. The atmosphere is very friendly and the volume of people talking makes it feel like a happening place, without having to raise your voice to talk. I think the friendly atmosphere starts with the wait and host staff as soon as you walk in the door until  I you leave. There are plenty of TVs, beers on tap and bottled, and other excellent dishes."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you hear a kid yelling across the restaurant to his mother bartender. Lots of tv's yes but exposed clutter wires. Good specials listed out side but never offered by staff. Over priced chicken parmigiana. Was swimming in sauce and the noodles were not drained properly. Employees hanging out drinking at the bar what seemed like on the clock as you see them in and out of the kitchen.  AC kicked on like it was 100* degree outside"}
{"text":"Been here twice. First time rocked, second time the food wasnt as impressive. Salad was great, garlic knots good, but was disappointed with the lasagna, this is somewhat of a bellweather of an italian place. It seemed to only have two layers of pasta, one on top and one on the bottom. I ordered sausage in the lasagna, it appeared to be chopped pieces of an italian sausage link (like bratwurst slices). I will try one more time since i really enjoyed the first time but was disappointed the second time."}
{"text":"We choose here for our Friday night out dinner with the family. Super family friendly, thank goodness. We had the garlic knots to start, yum. They were pretty good, a little more dense then I prefer but all together good. My mom and I shared baked ziti, there was enough for three of us. It was pretty good as well, sauce was on the sweeter side. My husband got a burger, a little over cooked but good. There was nothing spectacular with the food but we would absolutely go back. We sat at the bar and had a beer, bartender was super nice and the beer choices were good. I can see us hanging at the bar for apps and drinks. It's our kind of place.  Best part about this cute place was the staff, because of them I upped the stars. They were AWESOME. So nice, attentive, talked to our kids and just made it feel really cozy."}
{"text":"Best Wings in town!  Great eatery and local bar in Fort Mill,  which is a welcome addition to a much needed place to hang out with a truly great staff and fantastic menu."}
{"text":"Love the room, atmosphere and draft beer selection. Food was just OK, as I expected at a super casual place like this. I had spaghetti with meat sauce. The portion was huge but the flavor was a bit lacking. The spaghetti was slightly overcooked, which they do a lot in the south. Service was awesome."}
{"text":"This is our go to Italian, pizza and wing place. They have amazing NY style pizza, crispy wings with many sauces to choose from, and a delicious meat sauce with garlic knots.  It is a family friendly restaurant that offers many TV's to watch the game and the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Consistently awesome. Solid food and atmosphere"}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday to watch the games. Food is excellent. Our son enjoyed playing with the life size connect 4 game and others in the back yard. We've had both pizza and wings. Both are fabulous. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Normally my experience would be a four star review but given this was only their 5th day open they will get a five star review. This place is super close to my home and the name of the restaurant is my last name so I had to give it a try. The second we walked in the door we were greeted by multiple different employees and were seated right away. The place was super busy which was a good sign. I ordered a vodka drink and my husband ordered a margarita and both were very good. My daughter ordered a milk, which they were out of but an employee ran to the grocery store next door and took care of that situation promptly which was awesome. We ordered the cheese sticks and garlic cheese bread as an appetizer. Both items came out quickly and were not disappointing. We both order a slice of the supreme pizza which was on the menu for 3.50 a slice plus wings. After 20 minutes of waiting for our food our waitress came out to tell us the buffalo pizza could not be ordered by the slice. Now with two kids, I would have appreciated knowing that faster than learning of this mix up 20 minutes after we ordered. I ended up just getting a slice of pepperoni which took another 20 minutes for a slice?? The pizza was like a 4 out of 10. My husband got a slice of cheese and said the same, really not impressed! The wings though were great. Like really great! So we will be back and we feel the little kinks that we had were just due to only being open for a few days! Kudos for doing such a great job with such loud crowds your first week. Can't wait to come back and try some pasta!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pub food in the area. The sauce is not bad... and the chicken sandwich rocks! It also had a sports bar feel on one side which makes watching a game an option. Family friendly as well."}
{"text":"Great service, great food!!!!  Dishes are amazing and you will definitely have leftovers"}
{"text":"We visited for the first time tonight. We were sat right away and our server was so nice and checked on us often. All of us (2 kids, 2 adults) enjoyed every last bite. My husband raved about the calzone and my steak and cheese was amazing. Tons of food so we have lunch tomorrow! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Regular ol' bar food... Nothing to write home about.  Some of the stuff too greasy.  Staff is friendly, avarage beer selection.  It is close to home and if bar food is what you want you could do worse.  Hope this helps."}
{"text":"My family dined at Pasquale's last night for the first time.  They were recommended by several friends.  We were still hesitant as the last restaurant that was at this location served us frozen food that had to be sent back 3 times.  Pasquale's was far better and my husband has declared it's our new favorite place.  Our waitress was fantastic and so was the food, thank you!"}
{"text":"Food was fairly good, not great. Our server was nice, but I asked for a glass of water twice and never got it. Two other servers were in obviously horrible moods and cursed right by our table on 3 occasions. All in all, we'll probably go back, but they need to get the staff trained up and under control."}
{"text":"We came on football Sunday with our friends, who are friends of the owners, and this place is great! The buffalo wings and pizza hit the spot! We got to try our friend's Pasquale's chicken pizza, and MAN it was good! We totally should have gotten a whole pie of that to take home! They make their own special secret sauce, which I described as a mix between BBQ sauce and buffalo sauce, because it was sweet with heat! Service is the best, from people greeting you on the way in, all throughout your meal and wishing you a good day on the way out.  We were just visiting on our travels around the US, but we would be back if we find ourselves in the area again!"}
{"text":"Now our new favorite! Pizza is excellent. Wings huge and spicy! Wednesday is s great day for wings .75a wingbeers are always ice cold. Waitstaff is great as is the owner. Lots of Big screen TVs for viewing! Pricing is very reasonable. Get in here."}
{"text":"Great friendly place with good food.  The Alfredo with all the goodies was amazing.  Pizza was a hit too - plus super nice service and good prices.  Met the owners - they are cool guys.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Yelp recommended this place while we traveled from Charlotte to Charleston and was pleasantly surprised. We were sat immediately and football was on :) we ordered the Poutine which is a HUGE portion! We ordered the 12 inch Supreme pizza and it was plenty big for us 2. Nichole was great and friendly and was on top of her game. I hope to stop by again one day. We really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Awesome new restaurant in Fort Mill/Tega Cay. Entire staff was extremely helpful and friendly!  The Buffalo Bites I had were excellent, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent.. for just opening they were on top of service and the food was crazy food.. excellent pretzel, crispy great wings, and my wife loved her salad of course;) will be back"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars  Pasquale's makes me really happy!!  Why?  Because Pasquale's is an Italian American restaurant with New York style pizza, calzones, pasta, burgers, wings....  I miss New York City!!  A little bit of New York style Italian American food but in Fort Mill, SC (near Charlotte, NC).    I've been here previously with my manager for a few beers.  For this visit, our whole team at work stopped by for lunch.  Lots of variety to choose from including salads, wraps, subs, burgers, pasta, pizza, and wings.  Portions are really large, so a colleague and I shared a Chicken Parm with Pasta.  I would have taken the whole plate of pasta, but I was traveling on business, so leftovers end up going to waste.  Even though it was a half portion, it felt like a full portion!!  YUM!!    ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience!  Decided to give this place a try since it changed owners and we were delighted with the upgrades in ambience and food quality.  Lots of variety on the menu and the portions are large.  Great to know there is quality Italian food in Fort Mill with homemade items."}
{"text":"We showed up at Pasquale's a week or so after they opened and have returned over and over again. (Check our Check-in's). This joint is a gem.  Not only are management and staff beyond friendly, we love their menu and craft beer selection.  We typically love to get pizza and various sides, but lately I've been blown away by their pastas.  The Cheese Ravioli Marinara is to die for and the baked Ziti is 2nd to none.  Perfecto!  Now their lunch special til 4PM is $4.99 for 2 pieces of pizza and a drink.  That's an awesome deal.  The slices are YUGE!  Love it and much better than $5 for a burger and fries nearby.  Seriously!   As a lover of Craft Beer, this place is also top tier.  They have 10 out of 14 drafts on tap that are Carolina Craft Beers. 10! That's better than almost any Italian restaurant I've been to in the Charlotte area.  Love it.  I'm not a wine and liquor person, but their selection looks great too.   All in all, Pasquale's is awesome.  I have met Jamie, one of the owners, and he's great; Always looking to improve.  And Nikki Frost behind the bar as well as Brie...cant find better folks anywhere. Great place and I look forward to stopping in whenever I'm in the mood for beer of pasta!  Kudos!"}
{"text":"Quick stop for lunch. I sat at the bar with ample TV's visible. Restaurant was clean and bartender Amanda was helpful and friendly. She suggested I try the pizza 2-slice lunch special, I added meatballs and mushrooms (see my checkin pic). Both slices were served timely, hot, and as I ordered. Quick and tasty lunch, will see you guys again!"}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and figured we would try it out, it wasn't bad. Had a meatball hero, nachos, eggplant hero, would definitely go back again. Nice service as well, very friendly."}
{"text":"Love it,great pizzas and eggplant parm, great people and close to home.. we love Brie she rocks!"}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out since we live right down the road! The first time we went, I got the Parmesan chicken hot sub and fries. I was expecting a 6 inch sub. It actually came with a foot long sub cut in half, which I love because I usually eat one there and save the other one for lunch the next day! All of their portions are huge and the prices are decent. My only two complaints would be their garlic knots are super dry and the service can be slow depending on who your server is!"}
{"text":"if you want a good pizza stay away from Danny's and come here. it is relatively tucked away so doesn't get as much attention as it deserves. probably the best pizza in Fort Mill at the moment that I'm aware of. very nice."}
{"text":"We put an order in to go and take it home.  I'd never been inside or had their food before.  We were in a hurry, didn't have time to make dinner and decided to roll the dice.    My husband got the Stromboli and I got the Garbage Spaghetti.  I feel like I owe somebody's Mama a Thank You note!  First of all - pasta is perfect, Al dente.  There's onions, spinach, peppers, sausage and these ginormous meat balls!  But honestly the sauce is what makes it.  The salad was kinda special too with all the veggies and pepperonis and olives.  Got the Italian dressing which tastes home made.  I'm guessing it's all from scratch there.  Really the only thing not spectacular was the garlic knots.  They weren't bad they were just garlic knots.    Anyways, the portion is huge and I'm pretty sure it's gunna last me two more meals!  At first when we ordered I thought wow a bit pricey but honestly whoever's Italian Mama made this can just take my money."}
{"text":"Mom & Dad had pasta dishes, they looked good but had zero flavor. Meatballs are not homemade, nasty & frozen. Wings were undercooked,  the sauce had a terrible flavor & was watery. My calzone was the only thing that was good. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"The chicken Alfredo is great. The rolls are good. Not very busy the few times I've been. The food is good, people are nice, and my drink always stays full. Great place for families."}
{"text":"Well decorated Pub/Sports Bar that sells good Italian food. Full house on a Friday night, but great service. My wife ordered chicken parm sandwich and as previous posts addressed it lacked chicken. My sausage onion and peppers was delicious and fries were good and hot.  Son's cheese pizza was good, not 'NY style', but I had a slice and it was good. Sauce had great flavor.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I always leave wondering why I went back. It's local but the quality of the food just doesn't do it for me.   In my opinion, the Italian dishes are devoid of any flavor other than oregano; which is overwhelming in the extremely underwhelming sauce. Its the kind of sauce that stays with you LONG after you eat it.   I was with three other people tonight and everyone agreed that the food is below average. Too bad, because it's a decent price point and a nice location."}
{"text":"I just left here! I came in to order take out and the food was wonderful. The hostesses were all very kind and welcoming. Lindsey and I talked while I waited for my food and she told me a bit about the restaurant and her favorite things. I've been here to dine in before too with my mom, and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food. We had the eggplant parmesan and the Alfredo pasta with added chicken and broccoli. It was so Good! Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The last thing Fort Mill needs is another pizza place. And this one does nothing to stand out from the others."}
{"text":"Crazy to learn this has been hiding around the corner from me all along. When my Parents come into to town they always look to visit non-chain restaurants and new to us/them restaurants. Pasquale's was the choice on their first night.  We were seated right away. It took a little time before we were waited on, but they busy.   They have a decent on tap craft beer selection. We ordered some cheese sticks as an app, boy those were tasty! I had pizza for lunch so I opted just for a basic wrap - Greek chicken wrap to be exact. Also ordered was an entree salad and chicken parm entree.  We were all happy with our selections and cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"I was getting an oil change at Express Oil Change (which I HIGHLY recommend) across the street. I knew a restaurant had opened there recently. Took my life in my own hands crossing GHR. As soon as I saw the name my brain said, \"Meatball Sub\".  I was NOT disappointed. I told Kyle my two criteria for an excellent MS was that is had great flavor and it had to be messy. It met the challenge. Nice to meet both Kyle and David, a customer. I will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious lasagna and friendly service.  I will come back again for happy hour.  Looks like a place where everyone knows your name."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. My friend and I chose this place because it was centrally located in the middle between us and was a pretty equal drive.  When I arrived early it was not very busy.   It was so hot in waited inside and was immediately seated and had a soda right away.  As soon as my friend arrived the hostess had taken her drink order and she too had a soda.  The hostess was friendly, made good eye contact, and walked confidentially,  not with the\" it's Saturday and I have to work\" attitude a lot of kids have.    The menu has a nice variety of Italian food or burgers and other public grub.  Plenty to choose from. Our waitress    I wish I could remember her name, was wonderful.  She gave us plenty of time to say hi and ask about traffic as I think she could tell we don't see each other much.  We did order.  My friend ordered slices of the specialty pizza   mighty meat.  It had ham, bacon,sausage, and I think pepperoni.   The slices were very large.   Husband and I went back a second time....not a good experience. Would change to 3 star."}
{"text":"Great homey place.  Owner stops by and makes everyone feel comfortable.  Good specials, great food.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"First I have to mention one thing that turned me off immediately: THE GARLIC KNOTS ARE RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED and I love my knots: $5.50 for 6 tiny knots. Danny's down the block are 6 for $2.95 and 13 for $4.50 and Brooklynn Pizza Parlor in South Park offers a dozen knots (my opinion best in town) for only $4.50. Guys it is bread most Italian restaurants give bread for free....  Okay now that we got that off my chest: The staff are very friendly, service was excellent and they do offer some good specials. Especially lunchtime. The pizza was good, the crust was not as good as I would expect for NY Style pizza, it seemed undercooked. The knots were good, not great, fresh, but not enough garlic, sauce was delicious.  Overall putting aside the cost of knots I would rate it a B. I will give it another try.   My son who is the most fastidious eater I know especially when comes to pizza (he does not like Danny's down the street), liked it, but so much the knots very picky.   One last note: the curb when entering from McDonald's is hidden and I almost got my car stuck on it, who knows the damage caused to my undercarriage. You need to put a bush or something so people can see it!! PLEASE!"}
{"text":"The few times we have been they have been short staffed. The Italian food has no flavor, but my husband likes their wings."}
{"text":"We ordered based on great reviews.  The food is horrible. I've had jar sauce much better.  Save your money and cook at home.  #horrible"}
{"text":"Very average. The Italian food I had there was average to below. The wait staff was excellent. The ambiance was that of an Applebee's. Definitely worth skipping but you won't be disappointed if you go as long as you expect an average restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the waitress was so sweet. Wine and beer, garlic knots were great...shrimp Alfredo...too much pasta with NO seasoning not enough shrimp. I would go back for a drink though."}
{"text":"A great NY style Italian restaurant. Really good pizza and huge pasta dishes. Multiple tv's with sports. They also gave a small patio and gave many local draft beers."}
{"text":"First time at this new restaurant in Fort Mill, SC.  I ordered my food to go.  I walked in, placed the order and it was ready in about 20 minutes, pretty good.  It was on a Monday around 7pm, so not that busy at the time.  I ordered the Michigan hot dogs with added cheese and the fried pickles.  The wife had the alfredo, no adds.  The hot dogs were great!  Definitely order again, the buns are grilled (nice touch).  Fried pickles little thicker slices and a little soggy but breading stuck and the dipping sauce (chipotle mayo) is very good.  Wife said the alfredo was a 3 out of 5 for flavor but they give you a LOT of it, enough for two!  The garlic knots were awesome she said.  She said she will definitely order it again.  All in all, we liked it.  The menu is pretty decent and just about everyone should be able to find something they like.  I will be trying more!"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant when we lived in tiny Peru, NY was Pasquale's. While driving in my new home town of Fort Mill, SC today, I saw a sign with a sign of the same name. Brought my wife for dinner and the menu looked similar; even referenced a Montreal special. Asked for the manager and low and behold, it is the same owner!  So excited!!!  Their food is great!  Tasted here just like it did there. Give this place a try. This is the kind of family owned establishment you want to support. You will be happy and will return."}
{"text":"The food here was very mediocre. Purchased the garbage spaghetti dinner. Garbage spaghetti ? Yes that's the same reaction i had when i heard the name of it. Had peppers,sausage,and mushrooms.Came with a side salad,two small garlic knots, and a side salad. We took our food to go. Nothing really to brag about i would probably go back to try something different, i will give them another chance."}
