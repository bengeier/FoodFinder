{"text":"I've ordered through justeats 3 xs and eah experiene was worst than the last. I'll never again, if if its free.  I ordered from them on boxing day and it took over 2 hours before my meals was delivered. The driver called to tell me he was running late and to meet him outside. I wanted to go outside to order food, i wouldn't be using justeats. I get my food and it was the wrong order. after I called the driver back and went downstairs again to meet him, i gt my right order but my desert was missing.  I alled stori to complain about and the first thing th guy says is to call justeats. No apologies or owning to their own shitty service.  I alled justeats and they only offered to refund my desert."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience ever!! Don't go there for brunch at least!! We went there for a Sunday brunch, the place is nice great location and cute decoration but the service is really bad and terrible food, when we arrived, there were a total of 6 people in the whole restaurant, the waitress was running like a chicken with the head cut off, but accomplishing nothing, not to be mean but I had stand up and ask for everything starting for menus, witch they didn't have menus, we never got what we asked for, and they basically brought a \"sample\" of everything they had, including frozen eggos sold as \"waffles\" so long story short, it's not a buffet brunch, it's a we'll bring you whatever we have left over in the kitchen bunch..."}
{"text":"If i could give this place 0 stars I would. I went here with my best friend last night and I will NEVER be back. They charge a $20 cover on a monday night and the staff are extremely rude and act like theyre better than everyone. If you are white dont bother coming here because they will treat you worse than the dirt on the ground. We werent allowed to hold our jackets, they made us pay for coat check. We didnt even get to dance to one single song because everyone kept yelling at us for no reason. telling us where we could and couldnt stand. hell if you even so much as breathe they have an issue. we tried to dance to a song we liked and the staff gave us an eye like we were doing something wrong and then the one bouncer shakes his head at us. right after that some prick tells me to get a grip on my friend... what shes having too much fun for you bro? all she was doing was dancing and not harming anyone. Then some girls boyfriend yelled at us because i guess we were dancing too close to him (his girlfriend was giving us the cut eye all night) it was so ridiculous! everyone there acts like an entitled prick. the bartenders didnt even want to serve us they just lean against the wall and stare at you. We were the as long as we could stand it (about 20min) we tried to make the best of it because between the both of us we dropped $60 just to be there. We left and asked for our money back and they wouldnt give it to us.. of course. The WORST \"club\" ive ever been to in my life, ive never gone anywhere and been treated so poorly. I dont recommend anyone go here EVER!"}
{"text":"This place has dishonorable people running the show. They delivered my food an hour and fifteen minutes late (total time 2h15m after ordering) and after calling back and forth five times, I was told that I would get a refund for the cold and late food and received an apology. I ordered it through Just-eat.ca. I called Just-eat back 2 business days later (placed the order Saturday 12am) on Wednesday afternoon and the just-eat rep patched me through to the restaurant.  The guy representing Stori was rude, obnoxious and lacked a basic understanding of customer service. He refused to provide a refund, his justification was that I was calling back on Wednesday despite ordering on a Saturday and that because I didn't have the name of the restaurant rep who promised the refund, he wasn't going to issue it. Besides losing his temper and telling me how the restaurant business is run (clearly he had no idea as seen from his ape like mannerisms) he cut the phone on me. The just-eat rep who was on the line for the entire call was just as stunned at the brutish character displayed. She kindly offered to cover the refund and Just-eat had to bear the brunt of the broken promise provided by the restaurant.  Also the food was a solid 5/10 and I only bought it because it was 50% off. I would not recommend patronizing this restaurant as there are more deserving restaurants out there with people who actually know how to engage in civil dialogue."}
{"text":"This place is downright awful. We had a reservation at 830 and they made us wait half an hour for our table - we did get a complimentary drink which was nice though.  Once we did get seated we got a rude waitress that looked like she just rolled out of bed and was not dressed the part. And from 8:30 - 11PM all we got served was our appetizer !! Not acceptable. And of course during that time they were turning the place into a \"club\" and cranking up the music so we couldn't even hear eachother. Plus the place is so dark so if you have poor vision you're out of luck. We said we just wanted to leave and to forget about our entree but she said it would be ready within 10 minutes. 30 minutes later we had it and it was cold and not very good at all. And the poor couple beside us was there for their 2 year wedding anniversary and they were just told to leave because they were converting the place to a club! Bottom line don't waste your time - this place will be closed down within no time."}
{"text":"This place isn't really sure if it's a bar or a lounge. Dark and loud. Portions are huge but overall the food isn't worth going back for."}
{"text":"Apparently they are no longer open for dinner. Haven't updated website. Don't answer the phone. Don't advise you they're not open, even if you make a reservation.  Circling the drain, if they're not already completely closed down."}
{"text":"You get what you paid for, and in this case even less.  Ordered from Just-eat, Stori was offering half price on their menu items.  I was intrigued to try the place because it just such a deal.  What a complete disappointment the entire night became.    The order was delivered timely, however incorrect.  They send 2 pizzas when I had ordered 1 pizza and 1 salad.  Okay that happens, I get it.  We quickly called the restaurant and the lady addressed us saying they would make the salad and send the driver to deliver it in a few minutes.  Also she said, don't eat the pizza, the driver will take it back.  Okay, sure that works for me, though you delivered something wrong and tell me not to eat it, what you plan to do with a cold pizza that someone possibly touched, I have no idea.  We waited and an hour  passes, nothing. We call 3 times over the next half hour and they're intentionally not picking up.  We finally call just-eat which calls Stori and they tell us the restaurant will make our salad and deliver it right away.  We wait another hour and never hear  back.  I don't get it, if you don't want to deliver the salad because it's one item or you don't want to send the driver then don't tell us you will! Just issue a partial refund, tell us to keep the pizza and be done with it.  But to tell us twice over a two hour period that you'll deliver the salad and have us wait all night for the delivery is just so wrong.    Also on a food note, the pizzas were skimpy, lacking toppings and flavour, not even worth the half price. Don't waste your time or money here, money talks, but apparently just not here."}
{"text":"Not even worth a star...Even with 50% off the food was not worth more than a dollar. Are you intentionally trying to make bad food? I ordered your pasta and it came raw. The actual pasta was completely raw, almost like you left in like warm water and gave up. The pizza or sloppy toppings on a pita bread was 20$.. delisso pizza looks gourmet next to this cold garbage you served me. Stop serving food, read your reviews and realize you need to either close or change ur \"cook\". Brutal."}
{"text":"Very small. Rude staff. Not busy. Off the path location.   We went on a Saturday night and were held in the line up past the time of free cover so the photographer could take photos to make the place look busy although nobody was inside and we had guest list.  Would not recommend and definitely will not return."}
{"text":"this place lacks integrity.  not only is it sly but i would never come back.  lef me paint a picture... my group of friends come and they say its 15 dollars at the door but they only take cash so we hoto the bank and came back 5mins latrr they say its 30$  so we zaid forget it..then they change theif mind again and say its 15.  i give the girl 20 and she doesnt even give me change back and i ask hed its 15 wheres my change and she snickers.  what the hell kind of bullshit con scheme is this?   then we go in and no ones in the damn place its already 1230.  no wonder they try and charge extta trying to treat us like fools.  you get inside i order a run and coke and vodka soda.  so watered down i do t even taste any alcohol.  guess how much..18$ not including tip.  two shots 20$ are u fucking kidding me.  evedyghing ab this place is aweful. i give zero stars.  no integrity"}
{"text":"We ordered food from this place for our department team lunch. This place has the worst customer service ever and pissed off our entire department. Never will we recommend it to other people or order again."}
{"text":"Place was dead....sat night and noone was in there.  Maybe 15 ppl?! Music was live until ppl showed up, then the dj strted playing sleepy r&b music. Drinks are $9 each. Extremely overpriced!   Would never go again!"}
{"text":"We had a travelzoo voucher. The server did not show up until 6PM so the cook was trying his best to take our order. The restaurants was dark and full of flies, including one that ended up in my wine. The food wasn't great. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I am writing this review on both the Stori page and the Pizza Rustica page because Pizza Rustica apparently took over Stori last week.   This was the worst dining experience I have ever had, bar none. It was so bad that we went to McDonalds after to settle our stomachs. Below is a summary of the quality of service and food so that people are aware.  (1) Service We attended this place on Saturday April 7, 2018 for the birthday of one of our friends. Our friend made a reservation for 20 people, given the size of the restaurant you would think they would have prepared accordingly. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The restaurant had apparently lost my friend's reservation and overbooked. To make amends they offered to set an impromptu \"prix fix\" menu for the group at $20/person. That seemed like a great deal, and so we sat down for what would become the most unusual dinning experience I have had.  The first thing we did when we sat down was go to the bar and order drinks. The restaurant was empty, and it took us 5-6 minutes to get someone to take our drink order. My friend ordered his girlfriend a Moscow Mule. What he got was not that, it was most likely a vodka soda but who knows. I ordered my wife a gin and tonic. My wife's response to that drink was: this tastes like nail polish removal.   Subsequently, the restaurant apparently ran out of wine. So that's fun.  (2) The Food  What to say here? Well, the food was abhorrent at best. The restaurant was either not equipped to serve the food it was making or was making food on the fly without having any knowledge as to how to properly prepare that food.   Appetizers: fried calamari, salmon tartar, salad.  The fried calamari was anemic or anorexic. I'm not sure what the appropriate term would be. Where you normally expect a calamari ring that is roughly at least half a centimeter in width, these were strings of calmari rings that were overly fried and delivered without a dipping sauce to speak of.  The salmon tartar. What is salmon tartar? Well, by the standards of this restaurant that would be raw salmon with a ton of salt sprinkled on it on a bed consisting of nothing more than a thin slice of tomato. This was less tartar than a quick way to raise a person's blood pressure and give them food poisoning. I had one bite and had a full glass of tepid water to clean out the taste of salt and stale fish.  Main: Pizza, Risotto and Lasagna   The pizza was either burnt, overly topped with blue cheese, or was a margarita pizza covered with barbecue sauce.   When the waitress brought out the \"lasagna\" it was what could best be described as a plate of schlop masquerading as a lasagna. In fact, when asked what it was the waitress said, \"It's lasagna...I think\". That is a strong vote of confidence from your own staff. To paint a better picture: it was basically a bunch of lasagna pasta in bolognese sauce with mozzarella cheese on it. It had no shape at all and it was insufficiently salted.   The Risotto was...well it looked like vomit, I refused to try it for the sake of my own health.  Dessert: This was the only saving grace (I gave it a star for this alone). I think it was red velvet cake from a store or the Metro down the street. Whatever it was, it didn't suck.  Coffee? We asked, the waitress said they ran out of coffee... I guess the espresso machine was just for show.  Will we ever return? Certainly not."}
