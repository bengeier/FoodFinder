{"text":"Love this place! We came here almost every day when our kitchen was being renovated. The owner is extremely nice and always gave our toddler extra fruit and snacks. The food is delicious and there are always new specials to choose from."}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to give 4.5 stars, because this place is basically five star material but I came away feeling like I didn't get enough food for my money.

The servers working were pleasant and smiling, you get an overwhelming sense that they have a lot of regulars and with good reason. My guess is that once you're there 2-3 times they'll recognize you, remember your name and what your order was. This just feels like that kind of place. 

I got a Salmon sandwich on a bagel and it was fantastic. I paid $5.95 for it and for that price I was hoping for 30% more food but that is the only slight I could possibly give this place. 

Otherwise this is everything a quaint local eatery should be."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and burritoes. Also has the advantage of being across the street from Medex, which has great medical marijuana. Great prices, too."}
{"text":"Para ser un Lugar anunciado en Univision en realidad no es el Lugar Que dibujan en la television pedimos un cafe tres leches y duraron 1 hora para entregarlo y el desayuno se volvio Cena llegamos mi familia y yo a las 10:00  salimos de ahi casi 3 horas despues Nunca Regresaremos!!!"}
{"text":"I was ignored for the first 10 minutes while kids ran around unsupervised. Place looked dirty and I felt unsafe eating there. Didn't try the food."}
{"text":"I've been remiss in failing to update my review subsequent to my initial visit and review.  In the ensuing 20 months I have visited multiple times and am more of a fan than I was initially.
Somehow I failed to note in my initial review that the burritos are $2.50!  In addition to the bistec ranchero, the mole and asado burritos are excellent.
They have excellent latin-flavored burgers - the loco and the Chihuahuan  are especially good.
I ended my initial review with a mention of the nieve de elote (corn ice cream) and asked \"What's not to like?\"  Unfortunately, what's not to like is the fact that it is not a regular menu item and is rarely available.  Likewise with the outrageously delicious pozole that I had once and haven't seen again.
They have recently taken over the adjacent store approximately quadrupling their seating capacity.  Last time I was there the overflow dining room was full."}
{"text":"Really good service.  Nice and simple breakfast and fair prices.  Good to bring your family your significant other and even your friends. I'll be defiantly  coming back."}
{"text":"Chef onsite has great flavors! The Argentinian Burger with Chimichurri Sauce was amazing! Add fresh handcut fries and its a homerun for under $10!

Staff was attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"I really like this little spot.  Food is good and great specials!  Plus I like the espresso bar with tres orchestra. :)"}
{"text":"Lovely service, incredible eggs and amazing sandwich melts! A favourite in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of hype about Lunch Box. I live nearby and everytime I walk past this restaurant, it's always packed! The menu isn't that big - typical breakfast plates, pancakes, fried egg sandwiches, deli sandwiches, etc.  I had the whole wheat blueberry pancakes. They were okay but kind of bland. I would definitely recommend getting one of the combo meals with the pancakes + fruit/granola or pancakes + eggs, because 3 whole wheat pancakes gets quite boring after 1. They aren't the fun pancakes with the messy blueberry sauce - they're just the kind with blueberries baked inside + maple syrup. The service was friendly but also very slow. It was around 2 pm on a Sunday and it took almost an hour to make two plates of breakfast food."}
{"text":"A very small and simple place to grab lunch.  There is nothing all that special about this place but if you don't mind not having a fancy seating area or just in the mood for someplace that is a dive I would recommend checking The Lunch Box out."}
{"text":"Found the owner to be rude with her own staff. I used to go every day for a fresh squeezed OJ. After awhile I decided Im not supporting the owner. Last federal election they had a Liberal sign in the window. I don't care what party anyone in this country supports, but small businesses should never show political support one way or another. 

Food is ok, over priced though."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a while. I get the breakfast combos most of the time. The French toast being my favorite so far. The pancakes are not the best but not the worst. Combo comes with choice of eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, and surprisingly some fresh fruit on the side. The horchata and jamaica waters are not so great. It's not that expensive as well with less that 20 bucks you can eat good for two. I hate the fact that the place is really small and busy every Sunday!"}
{"text":"A consistently good, friendly and fast restaurant.  Family friendly and inexpensive.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Um. I can't believe this urine-soaked heck-hole hasn't been shut down by the health board. I used to work here and oh man, I could make you never want to eat out again with the stories from Lunch Box. The owner, a bitter Korean woman, smoked while she cooked. I caught 7 rats in the kitchen and she gave them to her 4 yr old as pets - in the apartment above the restaurant. Her great dane was locked in the tiny backyard and the sweet thing took massive horse-sized ahems everywhere. I know the food is decent but its super pricy to pay for the owners bad habits. Oh, and I have nightmares about her rubbing her grody feet and then going to cook. Barrrf."}
{"text":"The stuffs are really slow and they dont know what they are doing and what they have to do...they just missing orders a lot."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would! The new owners are so oblivious on how their time management is. Not only do you get dirty looks as soon as you walk in from a chick with a noise piercing but you get three people helping you so you don't know who your server really is. They do not offer a kids menu or kid sizes drinks, we waited over 40 minutes for our food and the place wasn't even busy and when we got our food it was cold and burnt. This place was amazing before loved it great vibe but the new owners have made this hole in the wall gone down hill I would never come back for the crappy service and cold food just ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Went to eat here yesterday. The food was not as good as it used to be. The drinks are ok. But I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered the small breakfast of bacon, 2 eggs, home fries and toast - it was good, but nothing special; almost your textbook diner-style food and almost exactly the same as you'd get at the Sunset Grill up the road.  It was fast and hot.

If you want to visit for weekday lunch, get there early, as the place fills up with retirees by 12:30pm every day."}
{"text":"A cozy little brunch spot located at the corner of Parkside and Bloor. I ordered the blueberry pancakes with yogurt, granola and fresh fruit. I think the cost was in the neighbourhood of $11 with a tea. Not terribly expensive but not cheap either.

The pancakes (2) were small and not terribly good. They were a bit bland and lukewarm. They are not close to the best in the city, but not the worst either. The yogurt/granola was good and it served as a nice contrast to the pancakes and syrup.

The crowd is a mix of young hipsters and old locals. It is cafeteria style eating where you order at the counter and pay at the till when you are done. Overall a decent option if you are in the area but far better brunch spots are just a km or two in every direction!"}
{"text":"Great burritos & burgers
Try the carnitas or red pork chili"}
{"text":"This place has a pretty good value proposition. Lots of homemade food for a low price point. The only caveat was it took way too long for our food. 

Pancakes 1 are 1/2 wholewheat and can come with blueberries for an extra buck ($6.95)

Pancakes 2 are 1/2 wholewheat and come with a side (breakfast meats+hashbrowns), 2 eggs and toast ($8.95).

Coffee not included. 

Staff friendly. Good neighborhood spot.

Lots of treats like bread pudding, pie, and gluten free snacks.


They accept credit and debit."}
{"text":"The Lunch Box is a place where you can get a super hearty meal that will leave you feeling nourished because it is made fresh, in-house by great people.  Their soups, sandwiches and salads are so fantastic. I am so grateful to have such a great place right next door."}
{"text":"Food was average, service was not good.  Might be good for burrito take out,  haven't tried that yet,  but won't go back for dine in.  We ordered coffee and one water......Coffee is serve yourself.  Water never arrived. Coffee was empty.   Told the cook and  the waitress the coffee was empty but they did nothing about it, just said ok.  so before we finished I told the waitress that she could bring us water instead of coffee since there was none.  That did it,  she said it would take 3 min.  I saw her run in the back and start making it... Right next to the young man I told 15-20 minutes earlier!   Hmm coffee was done when we stood up to pay.   Too late!   Also the odd thing about my toast.  :-).  I ordered rye toast with my breakfast, I could tell there were two slices as both halves matched!  Now the odd part was,  it was two top halves of toast...... Where was the bottom?  Oh yeah,  the toast was dry,  no butter.
Yup,  our last trip there but we'll give the take out burros one shot.  On a positive note:  they did apologize for getting us nothing to drink..and removed the coffee from our bill."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The food is mediocre and overpriced. I had their cream of zucchini soup and one of there sandwiches....WOW, what a joke! It honestly reminded me of hospital food. The orange juice tasted like the awful kind with the foil covering that you pierce with a straw. The sandwich was poorly put together-- toasted wonder bread that fell apart, cheap toppings. No one should ever eat here. Go to Tim Hortons or Subway, which are 5 star restaurants compared to this dump. Oh and guess what else? The restaurant is dirty."}
{"text":"One of my go-to breakfast places in the area, Lunch Box has never failed to deliver yummy and inexpensive food with friendly service.  The staff is cheerful and laid-back.  A pitcher of water is always available at the front, so you will never go thirsty.  The simple 2-egg breakfast comes with very tasty hashbrowns, and their marble rye is quite good.  Great place for a quick, casual breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"3.75 stars

This place doesn't really qualify as a greasy spoon or a diner, but it's breakfast special is called \"The Greasy Spoon\", so it counts!

Actually, the \"Greasy Spoon Jr.\", at 5.95, contains 2 XL eggs, choice of side, home fries and toast\". The \"Greasy Spoon Sr.\" contains the same as the Jr....only bigger. Makes sense.

The meat options (bacon, sausage etc.) qualifies as the \"side\", as does a home made fruit salad, which I had. Nice!

Order at the counter, take a seat and the friendly staff will deliver your food. Coffee is self serve, but bottomless!

Definitely more of a cafe than a diner vibe, but the breakfast fits the bill!"}
{"text":"This place was a bust! Either someone in Univision is related to the owner or Univision owns the joint!!! The food was gross and the service was horrible! The \"aguas frescas\" were gross, the place is beyond dirty and the waiter/ waitress need an attitude check!! Save your money and avoid this place!!! Never going back"}
{"text":"I'm sure the food is good, but seriously management should do something about their costumer service. Walked in today at 11am the older part of the restaurant was full to they told us to have a table in the other side of the restaurant (the newer) we got a table waited 20mins no one approach us at all for drinks or our order. So we walked out a went to Denny's instead."}
{"text":"This is a friendly little coffee shop on Bloor a few steps from Kipling station. The coffee is decent and the sandwiches are great. I tried the egg and peameal bacon which was nice but quite small. Next time I tried the roast beef which was delicious with the crunchy red onion and horseradish on whole grain bread. The soup looks good and probably worth a try. If you're in the area it is a solid place to visit for a coffee and snack."}
{"text":"we ate there because it is advertise on tv alot, food was not great, wait time about 40 minutes, service was awful.  we won't go back again, and several of our friends tried also and didn't like it. food is cheap but not worth it."}
{"text":"Ok ! I don't know how to start !!!! , this is the second attempt , yes is the second time we came here for brunch , the first time was like3 weeks ago , and food was just ok , I was honestly so disappointed, the first time I ordered  chilaquiles ( they were good , but so simple ) the eggs were so bad over cooked , for the food I will give them maybe 3 start , it is sad that they have the opportunity to create a better options of dishes or a least not over cooked , the horchata it was so watery , and I ask the waitress if they have  a fresh squeezed oj she said yes ! And what she brought me was not what I expected, it seems they put an orange on the blender with waters so that was my oj !!! That is not acceptable, I am a master of juices and this was disgusting, but the worts part is the CUSTOMER SERVICE !!! If the owner really read this please try a least to train your waitress , most of them are so rude, take for ever to take a order and forever to serve the food !! I'm Mexican and I was expecting better quality and better experience !!! I don't think we gonna give them a third try , we should went to the kiss the cook ,,, and here still waiting for my check that I request 15 min ago :/,, REALLY BAD EXPERIANCE"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and waited almost and hour for my food. Got the menudo which was burnt and cold. Also my scramble eggs were raw and the waiter had a bitchy attitude. After waiting another 20 minutes for my scramble eggs they never came. My family and I got up and left and the waiter still wanted to charge us for the meals we never ate!! She was rude and disrespectful and will never go there again!!! Worst service everrrrr!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled veggie and hummus sandwich. The sandwich was good, but nothing spectacular. It was what you would expect from a grilled veggie and hummus sandwich. 

It was quite small, though, and came to over $7. The servers and people were nice. But after paying more than $7 for a tiny sandwich, and trying to fight off the flies and the wasp, I kind of regretted I regretted not going to the Subway nearby. 

I don't think I'll come again."}
{"text":"I hate having to give bad reviews, HATE IT. But, I almost felt like I was at the DMV just for an order of okay chilaquiles with a side of burnt hash browns and a teaspoon of beans. Just like everyone else, I waited 30 mins for my food. The owner was there and instead of being more concerned of its customer service he was more concerned with a birthday table serving tequila shots. Does a liquor license even exist there? It makes me upset that he focused only on a specific table. I don't care if they are your family or not I'm a paying customer and expected better service. Fix the occurring issues and MAYBE you can be a 3+ star restaurant."}
{"text":"LBC never fails me! I've bright various family members here and they'll travel from far and wide to eat here now! 

Off the menu you've got to try the La Loca burger.. or any burger because they are all fantastic in their own way. 

The specials change all the time and Chilo the owner/chef never ceases to amaze me. I've tried food here I never thought I'd want to. Escargot?? Check!! Filet mignon with horseradish mash potatoes! How can you go wrong??

Today was ribs with mash potatoes! Fantastic!!"}
{"text":"A strong 3.5/5 for lunch here.

I went with a friend for lunch and our meals, with drinks (1 bottle water, 1 can of Diet Coke), came to $23. I'll note that I didn't tip.

We both got sandwiches and the accompanying soup option; they had about 5 options of soups, and we both got carrot ginger. The soup was clearly homemade and flavourful. I chose the brie & avocado sandwich which was very delicious, whereas my friend had the grilled cheese with bacon added. We were asked for our choice of bread which was nice. Both sandwiches were substantial and filled with toppings.

The service was nice and efficient."}
{"text":"I've been here twice (not a great part of town ) I met friend here the first time that was working in the area second time just had to go back!!! 
I've only had the burgers, they have about 20, they are great fries are awesome wish there would have been more service was ok 
I think the place is a diamond in the rough"}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a bad review only because I've been here before and they have been friendly in the past, but today I experienced the worst customer service. The lady that took my order was rude and short with a attitude, she also changed out all of the trash bags and counted her tip money where the food goes, change out the salsa and then had the audacity to touch all of silverware with her dirty hands and then bring me my food, take other peoples orders and serve them like that too. 

Like do they not believe in washing their hands and following the health codes... besides this my food wasn't very good. This place has lost it and has become lazy. 

I won't refer anyone here ever again or visit this place."}
{"text":"What happened!!

Change of ownership I think, new sign new paint job inside..
The staples of the food have also changed....

Use to eat there all the time.. Have been out of town the last 6months and when I came back, I sat down and was surprised by the make over which was a welcome change. However I noticed the staff was different as well and asked about that as they use to always remember my usual order even when i called in. The new staff was nice. Which made the eating experience better as the food seemed off? 

The home fries which were my favorite as I do love my late day breakfasts lacked any taste and were bland as can be.. the toast was ok, and the turkey sausages seemed larger but also lacked taste... I think the previous owners did not fully explain their recipes to the new owners. 

The cream of Mushroom soup also tasted like it was out of a can with extra mushrooms thrown into the batch... lacked authenticity. 

This made me so sad :(  as this was one of the staples in my life for the last number of years and could always count on a satisfying meal....

Will give it another try in a little while and see if things have changed....
but the last meal was a bit off putting.... 

hopefully it is just a small hiccup as the new owners get their bearings on the establishment...

Sherry ;)"}
{"text":"I Cant believe i had not written a review. Been here plenty of times. Always consistent flavor and service.   Don't expect anything fancy. This is a diner like what you would find in Mexico; home cooked style food. I usually like to get their guisados and burros. They are $2.50 by the way(meaning you could try 2) and they are not your filibertos size, so be warned. My favorite is the Chile Pasado(such a savory flavor) and trust me its not spicy. Also i like to go for the Barbacoa and Asado. I have had their breakfast as well and doesn't disappoint.  Prices are very fair and wont break the bank. They are no longer limited to the small dining area, they have now opened more seating so no more waiting around waiting for a table! Yay!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the new ownership (or management, not sure) has effectively killed what used to be a great local diner. Frowny face. I predict this place will close within the year unless a saviour swoops in."}
{"text":"A sweet little place by High Park. Did not spend too much time here but the little time that I did spend was very pleasant. Ordered two sandwiches, and waited in a atmosphere with both friendly employees and patrons. Was also offered a free piece of delicious banana cake. Will come here again."}
{"text":"I came in here for a quick sandwich after seeing it across the street from the Petro Canada I was at. I went for their grilled veggie and hummus sandwich on brown toast and it was love at first bite. 

It's missing half a star because it could do with just a bit more add on options, a slightly more exciting menu (most of the menu items seem very standard even though I would assume they are all as tasty as mine was).

There is free wifi (I didn't try it out as I didn't want to spend too much time there and risk my vehicle getting towed being parked at the gas station), very friendly service, enough seating space and an overall cute-sy feel to this place for it to be a place I would recommend for anyone looking for a light meal in the area."}
{"text":"I had the green enchiladas. Amazing. Just a bit spicy, lots of cheese and amazing green sauce. The service was great as well and the food arrived within 10 minutes of ordering. This place is amazing and I can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices When you order food here, make sure you're hungry! The burgers and sandwiches are huge and priced considerably well. For not much more than fast food (about 6 bucks for a burger/fries) you'll get more food than you can eat at once! 

They also have really good horchata rice milk, that they make from scratch. Sometimes it's really sweet and filled with lots of cinnamon, sometimes it's a little watery. The espresso is also decent, some of their recipes are from their own creation (tres leches is really good). Almost all of their specials are recipes from the owner. The burgers, sandwiches and burritos are delicious. 

If you do order burritos though, make sure you order at least two, as these are the only things I've ordered on the menu that are relatively small in portion. Definitely worth checking this place out! It's on the corner of Bethany Home and the 17 (just west of the 17) on the south side of the street. Also...very kid friendly!

MAKE SURE YOU BRING CASH! They don't have a credit/debit reader."}
{"text":"Well it was beautiful afternoon thought a nice sandwich would good at the lunch box ....
But my 10 minute sandwich turned into 40 minutes later.
Most disorganized group of ladies ... literally chickens with there heads cut off trying to make a simple sandwich .
No sandwich is worth this....

Ladies organized ourselves!!!"}
{"text":"When I'm away on weekends from Toronto it's their hollandaise I crave.  Their sauce, like so many things at the Lunch Box, is whipped up from scratch and turned into yummy wholesome perfection.  So many great things to get, either to stay or on-the-go...salads, homemade soups, sandwiches, fresh-baked banana bread...I could go on.  This great neighborhood place fills up fast on weekends.  Everyone from tiny tots to your granny-next-door loves it, so why shouldn't you?  

Since breakfast is served up all day my suggestion is you grab some java (Reunion Island) and a breakfast sandwich then cross the street to High Park and find a nice sunny bench where you can savour the goodness and the sunshine."}
{"text":"I've come here on a few occasions for lunch because I work very close by. The quality is mediocre and the food is generally overpriced for its value. I recall once coming here asking for a lobster melt and being served something completely different. I let this slide and ate whatever I was served. 

Today I went there for lunch and ordered a chicken pot pie and soup. Two people who ordered after me got served this exact special before me. Then I was told \"Sorry, we're sold out.\" I said \"Are you kidding me? I ordered before both of the customers.\" I simply asked for my money back. The owner offered a free chili (the soup I ordered along with the pot pie). I really didn't want this but accepted anyway.

I'm eating the chili now which was served with 2 very stale pieces of bread. The chili tastes very bland... like tomato sauce and ground beef. I would have preferred Tim Hortons across the street.

I have to say... time and time again I am disappointed by Lunch Box. I will officially never return again."}
{"text":"A favourite place for me to take the kids on a weekend! It can get very busy for breakfast so I'd recommend coming early or planning for a brunch arrival. The staff are super friendly and make the experiencing that much more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Great little place located off of Bethany just west of I 17.  It's on the south side of the street and if you don't look for it you will miss it.  Little family type place where they have a good Chef that is popular with the Spanish TV channel.  Great food, they open at 6am and you can order anything from breakfast to Pizza and Burritos (yes even that early).  The place is small and is usually packed on the weekends.  They only accept cash so don't bring plastic.  Their Burritos are only $2.50 and are fresh."}
{"text":"You must try the chihuahua burger, it's so delicious with the mix of ingredients they put on it. The service was excellent, our waiter was so friendly and very attentive. She made our first experience there very pleasant. This will definitely not be our last time there. The atmosphere was so welcome I can't rave about it enough. Don't hesitate to give this place a try. My boyfriend loved it as well.I'm telling you if you're reading this, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here. They don't have good service at all. Menudo was super duper spicy!! They had attitude about it because I told them that it was too hot & and then charged me for it. I only had 2 tablespoons of it. FAT ZERO THE SIZE OF JUPITER!!! No wonder why they only have three stars here"}
{"text":"The Lunch Box is an affordable, solid restaurant option wedged between High Park Village and Roncie. This location is great, especially if you just want a bite to eat during a day spent in High Park.

The staff are friendly and fast and the food is reasonably priced for its quality, however the seating arrangement in the restaurant gets very tight when it starts filling up. Our brunch at The Lunch Box was spent wedged beside a couple who were fuming over some bad decisions made the previous night. In other words, its not a great restaurant for big groups. 

Due to the limited seating, I recommend grabbing your lunch to go, as the sandwiches are well worth the price, especially in that location!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite occasional vices is to treat myself to a good breakfast out when I'm off from work.  There's nothing quite like starting an entire day to oneself with a homecooked, sumptuous, solid meal.

Which is exactly what you'll get out of the Lunch Box.  A bright, cheerful eatery on the edge of the park, Lunch Box offers all-day breakfast with special entrees (such as eggs benedict or florentine) on weekends.  Their muffins are packed with fruity goodness and served straight from the baking tin.  Your tea or coffee is served in real crockery, and the photo of the dog at the fixings table reminds you that soy milk is available.  Their fresh pies, cookies, and \"the best banana bread in High Park\" will taunt you into submission.  

Add to the diverse and excellent menu a relaxed and soothing vibe.  Works from local artists adorn the bright, cheerful walls and smooth jazz sifts from the Sirius radio receiver.  The stack of newspapers includes local dailies, NOW, and the New York Times.  Neighbourhood locals are bound to crowd the charming wooden tables during peak mealtimes, so arrive early and be willing to enjoy a little elbow-rubbing from trendy strangers and their families.  

Yeah, ok, sometimes the portions could be larger.  But if you're someone who prefers quality over quantity, especially if it's made in-house and by free spirited folk, you've come to the right place.  

Bring your lover for that sublime morning-after breakfast, enjoy the sun in the park, and return later for a slice of pumpkin pie and hot tea.  Do it."}
{"text":"Love it!  On my visit from California, this was the only place I went twice!  Had lunch one day and breakfast the next and both hit the spot with tasty goodness.  Their bread selection is good and I'm told that bread can be hit or miss in Toronto, so I don't know where they get it, but highly recommended.  

The service is super friendly and accommodating, not to mention cute;)  It's small inside, but I didn't have a problem getting a table.  Food comes quick and like I said, very tasty.  I will definitely go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch!
Great variety, great staff, excellent fresh food.
I LOVE their Asian Noodle Bowl! Yumm!
Soups & sandwiches are always fresh & delicious.
Great all-day greasy spoon breakfasts too!"}
{"text":"My most favorite go to spot for breakfast and the freshest orange juice ever! The place has a cozy feel to it too with plenty of seating room."}
{"text":"We've only been to the Lunch Box for breakfast but our experiences have all been good. I like their menudo and Jenny gets any of their breakfast items. For that, it's pretty much a can't-go-wrong affair. The staff is nice and (great on a weekend when everywhere else seems to have a 45 min wait) we've yet to encounter a wait to get a table."}
{"text":"Walked in to a full house so I wasn't expecting super quick service. I noticed the waitress on our side was all by herself, but it took 15 minutes for her to take our drink order. And then she told us we could get the drinks ourselves, that it would be quicker. She came back 10 minutes later to take our order and I ordered biscuits and gravy and my wife ordered tortillas and eggs. 45 minutes later she came back to our table and told us they were out of biscuits and gravy but the rest of the breakfast was about to be started. 45 minutes was too long so we left."}
{"text":"I wouldn't usually come to this area to eat but was in a hurry and wanted something other than taco bell. The menu online is completely different than when you walk in but so was everything else. Service was friendly and food came out relatively quickly but this place just gave me the creeps. There were flies flying around, place was almost dead during the lunch hour and just wasn't clean. I also didn't feel like I should have been in there...like a fish out of water. I ate my ham torta and undercooked fries quickly, just so I can get out of there. I will say the bread that the torta was on was really amazing! If I could just get that to go, I would come back. For everything else, no thank you."}
{"text":"Well, I've always said that I'll try just about anything once....but after eating here that's gonna start to change. Dirty, small & crowded, bad service, misleading menu, and the food is average at best. Needless to say I'll never go back!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly. 

I was hoping for a fresh, healthy lunch but food I ordered- a soup and a salad- was very very mediocre."}
{"text":"I love this place come here twice a week being a single bachelor And business owner
I either get the chilaquialas I think that's how you spell it there like an enchilada with eggs TO DIE FOR 
ALSO HAVE FRESH SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE  
AWESOME MEXICAN BREAKFAST SPOT!"}
{"text":"Pastrami good, new york steak was ok. Cheesecake is the bomb. Good fruit bowl."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. I ordered a hot breakfast of eggs, home fries, and bacon which was okay but nothing special. I also ordered a latte which was not good at all. I got a medium or large, and it just came in a fairly small mug. It was nothing fancy but cost a lot (4 dollars ish?) For a place that you stand in line to order, the price is high and the food is below average. I would go here again in a pinch and try their milkshake maybe."}
{"text":"I moseyed on into this place for the first time yesterday, because the window signs told me there would be some healthy options available inside. I was immediately greeted and assisted by the super friendly staff, who helped navigate me through the menu options. I settled on the Avocado Brie Tomato Sandwich ($5.95), which was put together on the spot with lots of care and attention. So yummy. I also appreciated the super homey feel inside... I'd love to come back for a brunch sometime, or for their all-day breakfast. I'm a fan, Lunch Box!"}
{"text":"Lunch box. I know the origin of the name.  Where you spit your lunch in a box. Weird tasting eggs, soggy greasy French fries. Ummm....no thanks !"}
{"text":"This was my very first Canadian stop when I arrived in Toronto one month ago. I asked for a \"Traditional Canadian Breakfast  Food with maple syrup\" and they got me some french toasts. They were lovely and I became a fan of this awesome place. 

Now and then I go there just to eat some different delicious food. May it be just an omelette or a brownie, always having fresh coffee as a companion - they offer soymilk on the fridge if you like it. 

I'm waiting for a weekend bruch opportunity so I can try the famous eggs benny. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna like them, I'm yet to find something bad at the Lunchbox. 

They are not cheap, but they serve you very well and they offer hooray free wi-fi, so you can eat, drink, check your emails and facebook. They also have a twitter account, but I totally forgot to take note of it. It's supposed to have their daily promotions!"}
{"text":"Had a filet mignon and eggs this morning !!! Awesome fricken awesome !!! Great service and the cappuccino was very good!! This guy can make anything you want !!!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased to find the Lunch box within 2 miles of my house! The food was great, service was friendly and quick at a great price. We had the juevos rancheros and the chorizo burger. Loved them both. We will definitely make this our local breakfast/lunch hangout! 

Definitely try their cappuccino as well."}
{"text":"Stopped here one morning cause it's on my way to work.  I always see a lot of police cars there, and figure if the cops are eating there religiously then it's gotta be worth a shot.

Meh.   Honestly, after seeing them make my iced mocha with hershy's syrup I became distraught, but when I tasted it I was pleasantly suprised.  Probably the best \"hershy mocha\" I've ever had.   

The fried egg sandwich with bacon was a cluster.  FRIED implies..  well fried, NOT SCRAMBLED.  Sorry for the caps usuage but  I was just terribly dissapointed.  My scramble stack of blandness on bread was a catastrophy. 

I might come back so I can try something else and boost the rating.  They only take cash too... a bummer cause I only carry my card (so I don't spend all my cash).

The restaurant in convieniently located next to the I-17 and Bethany Home Rd, and is pretty cool little place on the inside.  The owner was very nice and the prices are low.  

Meh."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. Omelets and coffee were decent, large portion sizes, but no free refills on the coffee, as in similar priced places offering similar menus!  The hash browns (home-fries) were excellent according to my friend!  

The service of the staff was very friendly and accommodating, but the service of what seemed to be the owner/boss was pretty rude. (as other reviewers have commented).

 She was very abrupt and glared at me, which made me feel very uncomfortable. Other reviewers remarked on this, and it's easy to see what they mean. WHen we paid the bill seemed to be trying to be friendly though, so maybe for a tip.. or maybe it's just the way she is... I'll be going to Sunset next time though!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch about half an hour ago due to the great reviews. 

Ordered a calypso, small cupcake and a veggie and cheese sandwich, came to $14.00. The machine asked for a tip, so I felt obligated to leave a 15% tip. 

Cupcake was stale, drink was fine. (pre packaged so I wouldn't doubt it.) when I got the sandwich the bread was rock hard, and they forgot the cheddar. The description said lettuce, tomato, mayo, cheddar and cucumber. When I got it it also had carrots, onion and bean sprout which I was not fond of. I sent it back asking for it not toasted and only what the description said. They made it again with still carrots and onion on it. 

I asked for a refund because at this point my whole lunch was wasted on this overpriced sandwich. She gave me back $7.50 which is what the sandwich costed, but kept the tip. 

So I paid $10.00 for a stale cupcake, a calypso and a waste of my time. Not happy. Usually yelpers steer me in the right direction but this time you guys failed me!! :("}
{"text":"I use to love this place, and I came back after moving out of state thinking it would be as good as the last time I was there and was so disappointed! The burritos are gross and the beans are nasty! My husband got a burrito de rajas and it had the gross beans (before, it was just rajas) my son ordered the french toast and couldn't eat it because it was like rubber (his words)"}
{"text":"Ordered:  Pancake Breakfast II which includes a fruit parfait and 2 pancakes(upgraded to blueberry pancakes for an extra $1)
Atmosphere:  Cozy little cafeteria-style diner place with friendly staff. You order upfront and take a seat and they'll bring you the food. Had a nice window seat gazing outside the 

Concern:  a piece of the honeydew tasted weird... and there were only 2 pancakes. I mean, for the price you pay, $11.25, I think there should be a minimum of 3 pancakes. I mean, for me the two pancakes were just right, meaning not too full, but not left feeling for another craving. Still, I'm sure for most people 2 pancakes would not be enoug especially if I were a male with a bigger appetite or something.

Verdict:  Lots of blueberries in your pancakes. Texture was nice and fluffy with blueberries in every. single. bite. which I loved! And I absolutely -LOVE-
maple syrup so I had to drown that shit in that cholestrol-cloggin' goodness. By its' side was a big bowl of fruit parfait, bigger than I expected. It had grapefruit, granny smith apples, oranges, honeydew melon, dried cranberries, granola and of course, yogurt. It was very delicious. Felt less guilty eating that after consuming so much maple syrup. A bit pricey, but the food was delicious. I'd definately go back.

{"text":"Someone needs to be more aware of the wait time they place on customers, 40 minute wait for breakfast is ridiculous, when the restaurant wasn't that full to begin with."}
{"text":"I was biking past High Park and saw Lunch Box... I KNEW it had been recently reviewed on Yelp but couldn't remember the verdict.  Undaunted, I ventured in to find a cheerful and bustling breakfast and lunch establishment.

The good:
- Blueberry pancakes with fruit parfait - really good quality... fresh plentiful blueberries in the pancakes... interesting variety of fresh fruit in the parfait, along with some yogurt and nut-ful granola
- Service was genuinely cheerful... someone dropped and broke a maple syrup bottle - it was cleaned up with grace.
- Other available baked goods looked delicious
- Moderate pricing

The less-good:
- To me, a \"stack\" of pancakes means 3 bare minimum... I was served 2 medium sized ones in this particular stack
- Agree with Cailen that I expected more food for the price, though I'll admit it was enough to satisfy most reasonable appetites.
- Ran out of water glasses (I'll give them a break on this - but they probably could have used one more staff person - they were all slightly run off their feet.

Not a destination, but definitely I place I would drop into when going by or make regular if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"I love the burritos at the right price taste delicious remind me of Mom's homemade food"}
{"text":"This is a pretty typical casual restaurant. There's nothing really unique on the menu but that's okay because  the food is decent.  The sandwiches are decently large. Some of them seem a bit expensive for what you get though.  Service seemed kind of confused at times but they were friendly.  The place is a tight fit though so don't think of bringing a large group here. This is a take out and go sort of place."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, and the food is good. But when I heard he had recently added the \"chicos tacos\" from El Paso. I was so happy because I'm originally from El Paso and we grow up eating chicos tacos they are the best!! But when I came to have them I was super disappointed  I have to say he falsely advertised the chicos tacos. It was \"NOTHING\" like the original chicos tacos not one bit. These were flautas with a no good red sauce. Sorry I normally don't ever review but since I was super happy about eating chicos tacos I have to give this disappointing review!! I do not recommend the bad imitation of chicos tacos. The rest of the food is delicious so stick with the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat, it truly reminds me of our food back home, and the burritos are super yummy, I love love this place. Check it out"}
{"text":"It was a wonderful lunch! I am SUPER particular about my Mexican food having learned  to cook from a Mexican mother from central Mexico. The chilaquiles green chili was very flavorful, the roasted salsa served warm was amazingly spicy, the service was very sweet and patient with our large group, and the cake was beautiful and fabulous. The rest of my group had the same wonderful reviews for their plates. I think my only let-down was a fish soup that had too much cumin (but I am particularly sensitive to it and can't stand it in any amount), otherwise we were extremely pleased and I TOTALLY wanted to take the owner home and integrate him into our crazy Mexican family. He TRULY made my Mom's Birthday lunch and amazing afternoon! Thanks to the sweet servers and adorable owner!!!!! Worth driving from Far East Mesa for us!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought a restaurant with a name like the lunch box would have such awesome authentic Mexican food. This is the real deal, absolutely delicious. The service was superb. The owner even sat down and had a very wonderful chat with my mom. As for the food, they are very accommodating. If it's not on the menu, just ask. They were happy to make up a special veggie burrito for the plant based vegan in our group (me). The salsa was sooo good too. I complemented the the owner & asked if they sold it to go. Not normally, but here they go the extra mile. They brought out some jars they had in the back for us to purchase. They were all so good, couldn't decide so took home all three. My dad had a chile relleno burrito & my mom the tacos. All very good. If you're in the area you owe it to yourself to stop by."}
{"text":"If you're slowly re-entering the world of solid foods after a horrifying, crippling, willpower-draining, week-long strep-isode (shoutout to Adrian B), leave it to none other than Mama Lunch Box to take care of your ailing digestive system and sore lymph nodes with comfort food in the form of: MAC & CHEESE!

Today's special ($6) was just the thing I needed for my re-introduction to the land of the living.  It beckoned from the moment I saw its name etched on the menu board out front. It was velvety smooth, incredibly creamy and 100% homemade...precisely the right remedy for my sore throat and somewhat impaired chewing technique. 

As always the staff at Lunch Box was super friendly and personable. All of the girls working the counter are very beautiful, stylish and chatty. They seem to know every customer and make meaningful conversation with everyone that walks through the door. You get a real neighbourhood-y feeling when you're inside.

Thanks for another kickass meal made with love, Lunch Box!"}
{"text":"Llegamos a desayunar no tienen mucha variedad! La comida no esta tan Buena como pensaba Como le asen tanta propaganda al lugar.. Bueno desidimos ordenar eramos 2 adultos y 3 ninos cuando pedimos la cuenta no salio con k era 72 dlrs .... se me hiso  much y le diije a otra mesera k me chekara la cuenta  y   resulto k me estaban cobrando la cuenta d otras personas casii 30 dlrs mas WTF!! James volvere a ESE lugar JAMAS"}
{"text":"This place may seem like a whole in the wall joint but it has some of the best food.  Actually makes his own hash browns for breakfast. Then there are the salsas that are homemade and very tasty and hot! 
Definitely come with an appetite because the portions are very big."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Ordered their \"Cream of Zucchini\" soup and received a styrofoam container filled with hot greyish spew that was as thin and watery as it was flavourless. Also came with \"bagel chips\" that are actually just stale pieces of toast.
I'm actually appalled that this place is in business and I feel like I'm missing something here... even their bottled juice tastes like it came from a hospital in '92--what the hell is going on?!"}
{"text":"Had it in 2013 and it was disgusting. Had it now and oh yes !!!! It was the best thing that has been in my mouth since dinner last night he he he... The long green Chile salsa is served hot with chips, it's perfect! I had the Barbacoa  tacos with rice and beans. The beans are perfectly seasoned and the rice was cooked flawlessly.. Went with a party of seven and everyone loved the food ( Tortas, burrito, chile rellenos, enchiladas) !"}
{"text":"The other reviewers were pretty close. I do think the place is super cute with lots of potential though. They need to redesign the new space they bought to match the cute original space next door. An artist could do wonders with those walls. They should make a super cool wall art mural like they have in the original space but even better. I liked the espresso bar and the old school diner look for sure but I sat in the new area and it was pretty ugly, dirty, grungy looking. Flies at the window. I hate that in older buildings. 

Let's start with the name of the place. Why is it called the lunch box and it has only four lunch options? The name is so confusing to me. It is more for breakfast which I did not stop by for. The menu is not correct online and it is very limited. It is also labeled American cuisine but with a mostly Mexican food menu. They do have a Gyro on the menu and some burgers but most of the their food is Mexican breakfast and I am not a fan of fast food Mexican food nor breakfast, usually. 

They do not serve drinks in glasses or cups. I was handed a water in a to go, plastic cup that actually had a bug or seed or something on the cup lip. Also, I have an issue with this from an environmental viewpoint. That is a lot of trash to generate every day. I ordered an Ice tea, and that was fine but only because they did not have any drinks that were diet. Really? I ended up ordering a turkey sandwich by default. The menu says it is actually cooked turkey but it was cold cuts or pressed. It was not fresh cooked turkey. Nothing special. It tasted like a school lunch sandwich. I could have made one at home for less than 2 bucks or bought at school for 50 cents more. It also had an odd taste to it. The sandwich came with fries that tasted very strange. I can not put my finger on it but they were awful and tasted very off. Like nothing I have ever tasted before. I have no idea why but i am guessing the oil. The potatoes were also rawish. 

I had no issue with the service as others stated. In fact the ladies working there are delightful! (thus the one star instead of zero) Yes, at first it seemed slow because I did not know if I could just sit myself or what. However, then it picked up. They are busy so the ladies work hard. However, they were very personable. Surprisingly, the place had a lot of customers. I sure do not get that but it seemed like the people in there were not foodies."}
