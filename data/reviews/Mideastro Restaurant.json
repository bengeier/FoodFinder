{"text":"I have now been to this restaurant 3 times.  I was dissatisfied each time.  I would not have gone the last time if it wasn't for a group meeting.  The food was ok but the servings were small.    The price was way too much for what we had"}
{"text":"Just very average and overpriced.  Yorkville prices in thornhill.  Not authentic at all.  They just make their own twist on everything.   Bring Vaseline, because of their prices."}
{"text":"Tried their lunch. A little pricey but still think worth it.....Have to try the beef carpacio as appetizer...Thumb Up..."}
{"text":"Food was great and amazing atmosphere. Only drawback that lowered it do 3 stars is because I thought groupons are supposed to be taxes on promo amount. Not on full dollars"}
{"text":"Fantastic alternative in Thornhill Great food and variety Marquez sausages and beet salad were both outstanding Decor is upscale for the area (strip plaza) Pricing is inline with similar restaurants I thought fairly well to do people lived in Thornhill based on the housing costs and private schools and luxury suvs in the driveways and parking lots Will be sure to return often"}
{"text":"My date decided to take me to this middle eastern restaurant, as he had read good reviews. Only it's not very middle eastern; definitely much more Italian. Nothing wrong with that, just unexpected  I tried mussels for the first time. They were delicious. I have nothing to compare them with, but they were delightful. Obv I was a hot mess while consuming them... I only bring my best dining skills on dates!  We then had a pizza each; I, the Fungi Pecorino and he, the Marhgertia. His pizza was very cheesy. Mine, however, was average. I've definitely had better.  The place itself is pretty snazzy. It was super empty, likely because it was a long weekend. Otherwise it seems like a good date place in the neighbourhood. The servers were very nice and helpful but perhaps not all on the same page. Could have just been an off night?  I would consider returning to try other mains but I've had better pizzas. The mussels are worth a second visit for sure!"}
{"text":"First walked in the place look very nice. Very spacious! The service was excellent and we felt we weren't missed. Our salad and the appertizers were pretty good. Now the down side was the main course. The steak was tender but it was over my mash potatoes and each time I'm eating my steak I also eating the mash potatoes a the same time. The was only couple strip of vegetable. My wife swordfish steak didn't make it well. All because we felt it was a little over price for what it is. I think 3 star is a correct rating for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was pretty wicked.  Had the cod cake salad which was a solid starter, but the sauce on it gave it a very middle eastern flavour.  The Otto Busco as a main was delicious. We were given sharp knives, but the veal was cooked so well, you only needed a fork to pull it apart. The mashed potatoes and bok choy added a great dimension to it overall.  Finished it off with lava cake which was fairly generic, but since I love desserts, it still hit the spot.   The place itself looks great, a solid mix of a lot of modern with a little bit of antique. I really loved the mash-up of music they had: Spanish, classical, middle eastern, Indian, and more. The wait staff are pretty good looking too! (Both the female waitress and the male bartender.)"}
{"text":"The servers try really hard to please which would be wonderful if there weren't so many. For once I could say that this place was overstaffed with underutilized workers for the relatively small size of the dining room.  It just lacks ambiance... the whole layout, atmosphere and decor just feels stuffy to me. Didn't feel it was suitable for the small business lunch I was organizing. We had a drink and left."}
{"text":"I ate here once before and the food was decent. I decided to return and plan my mother's birthday party at the restaurant and booked for a group of 12. The restaurant manager told us that we were allowed to bring our own birthday cake and birthday candles but that the cake was NOT ALLOWED TO BE EATEN!! He said that the cake would be taken away and that we would have to order dessert of their menu. Now, has anyone heard of something more ridiculous?! I know some restaurants charge a nominal fee if you bring your own cake but to not allow patrons to eat their cake is nuts.  I think the owners need to find a new manager before he drives the poor place in to the ground. To refuse a party of 12 over a cake with out offering a reasonable alternative leaves me speechless."}
{"text":"I was there for a private event (the whole restaurant got reserved), so the service and the atmosphere might be different.   Pros: + Nice atmosphere  Cons: - expensive for what you are getting - Food was below average - Red house wine is sour - service was sub par  Atmosphere: There were 5 large tables and 3 side tables.  Before we sat there each table was very nicely placed, there were small cups of vodka and whisky there and glasses for wine and water.   Food: For the appetizers we got 4 things (2 portions of each) to share for 8 of us seated. - Caesar salad 3 stars - the croutons were rock solid and burnt - Calamari - 4 stars, it was okay, but not amazing - Salad with goat cheese and mushrooms - 5 stars - Eggplant with Cheese - 4.5 starts   The red house was wine was pretty sour.  Would not recommend it. For the main course: I ordered a steak, it was about half an inch tick and slightly overcooked.  (medium instead of medium rare) With the steak came two broccoli peaces, both of them came with really long stems and was not edible.  Overall rating 2 stars.  Someone at the table ordered chicken paragon and it was below expectation (very small portion). Some else ordered another dish and the portion was insanely small.    Service: The service was okay, surprised that the people working there were not Italian, but all the dishes were and the wine was house made in italian style... The appetizers were served at a pretty quick pace which left the table packed with dishes.  And then there was more than half an hour break before the main dished were served.  My water glass was empty most of the time and the waiters did not seem to be coming around to check on the staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for our anniversary dinner. The waiter was extremely polite and gave us a great service!! They serve warm baguettes with delicious spreads (better alternative for butter)! The meal was very tasty!!! It was such a good deal from groupon. Will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Short and sweet:  delicious food and excellent service. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Terrible experience!!  Waited 40 minutes for apps ( caprese salad, carpaccio, meatballs )  after initially complaining for the time wait waitee told us things are made freSh there ( how pong dies it take to cut up a salad?!) meatballs were RAW the waiter also. Informed us it was a busytime ( 3 other tables being served)  For mains osso bucco was dry and risotto was far from risotto and more of a mixed rice dish   Do not even waste ur time"}
