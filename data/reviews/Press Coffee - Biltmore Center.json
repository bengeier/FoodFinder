{"text":"Best coffee in AZ and the food is so good too! I recommend this place to everyone and is always on the list to visit when we have friends and family in town."}
{"text":"We literally walk here every Saturday. It is the best coffee in the area & always consistent. Great coffee flavor & great service. Can't miss!"}
{"text":"We have bought dozens of 1lb bags of coffee from the roasters, and numerous trips to the cafe locations at Scottsdale and at Phoenix. They are the best coffee roasters in AZ, they also have the best baristas. We were very disappointed in this location. The sole barista on Sunday morning was extremely friendly and made us perfect espresso and cafe mocha drinks. The only food on hand was day-old danish, nothing warm. We did not sit in the couches but the low chairs were not very comfortable.   So they get 5 stars for the usual awesome employee and one star for the food selection and taste. Horrible choice by the owner IMHO to limit the food. In an upscale location like this it is a bad idea to serve Circle-K quality food."}
{"text":"Delicious cold brew! Glad this is so close. I'll be going here often"}
{"text":"Great coffee and excellent service. Wish they had more! Everything is very good and they have lots of healthy options. The location is excellent with an awesome work place indoor/outdoor energy. All in all a great place :)"}
{"text":"Best coffee in town served by the most friendly, professional baristas. It helps that I work in the same building, but this is my first choice for"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in on your lunch break and re energize. This coffee shop has a modern look, comfy furniture, outdoor seating, and free WiFi. It's very convenient to the businesses nearby and the staff is very prompt. They have pastries, sandwiches, and salads ready made. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Customer Service is great! My new favorite local coffee spot. They have a television with ESPN hammer on, outlets for your devices, comfortable couch areas to booth seats to comfy round table seating area, high top tables, outdoor seating, I think a ping pong table outside, and low two seater tables to 2 and 4 seater tables. They really planned his out well. Great for work and to come chill with friends. To connect to WiFi (free) select PressCoffee_Guest. That simple. The space between furniture is great and hey decorated this place really well. Very modern.   For milk alternatives they have soy and almond unsweetened. That got me all excited because now I can have my vanilla latte with no added sweeteners. I ordered an ice vanilla latte with unsweetened almond milk. Tastes good.   Their condiment bar has a microwave, napkins, straws, ground cinnamon, raw sugar cane, the normal sweetener options, etc. I wish they had stevia, erythritol, or monk fruit. I normally bring my own packets.   Much better than Starbucks. I'll definitely be frequenting this spot! They just opened in this location in November, 2017. It's across the street from Biltmore Fashion Mall. From inside you can see MACYs. Did I mention he temperature here is great. It's nice and cool, but not freezing like Starbucks."}
{"text":"Press just opened at this location recently and is hidden behind Wells Fargo and Over Easy close to 24th Street and Camelback and has an extremely spacious interior with various seating--comfy chairs, a couch, tables, and work counters with parking out front for a few cars.  When I was there, slightly after 8 a.m., office workers were picking up coffee and passing through. Definitely not overcrowded, though.  In my opinion, this is the opposite of an eclectic (aka mismatched furniture, pipes exposed) hippyish coffeehouse. It had a very comfortable, warm feeling with lots of seating and four TVs on one wall (maybe that was one big TV with four different channels).   I ordered a latte--8 ounces, which came standard with two shots and whole milk. Ask for \"hot\" if you prefer yours more than lukewarm. The espresso shots definitely came through the milk taste.   They had several options for black coffee, including two Ethiopian, one Guatemalan, and one Sumatra. They roast the beans and had several options for purchasing.  So, basically a full service coffeehouse situated in a convenient spot for many of the office workers nearby."}
{"text":"Awesome third wave coffee spot!  The batista loves coffee, loves talking about coffee and is not one of \"those\" that is snooty about it...just loves coffee!  The nitro alone is worth the trip. I'm not from around here but the location looks like a great spot to just hang. Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Any time a new coffee shop turns up it is essential that you try it out.   Press coffee is well hidden in the 24 center behind Wells Fargo. When you get there there are about eight parking spaces out front.  The decor is modern with bright lighting, comfortable chairs and a big screen TV that was showing four channels simultaneously when I was there.  My coffee, a 16-ounce vanilla latte tasted about the same as all the other vanilla lattes I have had in the area. It was hot, smooth and a pleasant way to have an excuse to relax and enjoy the surroundings.  I noticed that they have a few single origin coffees from which to choose. They had two Ethiopian coffees and a Guatemalan Huehuetenango as well as a couple of others on the menu.   Overall, I enjoyed my coffee and would return again if I was passing and needed coffee."}
