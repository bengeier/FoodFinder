{"text":"Living in the neighborhood, we have always walked by Atlas One but never have taken the time to wander in. Then last year we noticed it was going through some renovations, which from the exteriors made it look much nicer. However, still never went it. Then one day I read a local papers critics very positive review of Atlas One and that was the kick in the butt to finally make our journey over there. However, having 2 kids means we have to wait till the in-laws, or someone was willing to baby sit. And when that day finally arrived we made our way over. And let me say - WOWZA!.   The food was delectable! One thing that A1 never advertised was that they brought in a legit chef to helm the kitchen (from one of O&B's big restaurants Jump). It has taken the restaurant from middle eastern food to a delicious blend of Latin american-medetarrian fused cooking.  And he has done it beautifully! For starters i had the barada (i think that's what it was called) a white-fish/potatoe spread which was very tasty (and i am not a potato fan) and my wife had the minestrone soup which for vegan fare was very good too!. For mains, my wife had the ravioli which after trying was incredible - something that at least one person from each party should get. I had the fresh catch which was a bouillabaisse, which had had a very very flavorful broth and a beautifully seared white fish on top. mmm..tasty!.  My only complaint for the evening was that that they ran out of the tostones rellenos - how dare you not save one for me!  Oh wait, I have a second complaint - their beer selection is sub par! (but i had wine instead so that's OK)  Living in Wychwood, we have a couple of restaurants that are always packed and have good decent  food - no complaints, (you know who you are R and F!), but they are not up to the quality of A1's. And it is such a disappointment that that A1 is not as busy as these other establishments, because it should be! Next time you are thinking of going to Rushton or Ferro, try heading over to Atlas One. The food is great - and lets give it the attention it deserves! (That means line ups people!)  This part of St. Clair is becoming a foodies delight. Lets make sure we keep these places thriving! (And that does include Rushton and Ferro too!)"}
{"text":"Ridiculously delicious, outstanding personal service, a very pleasing room and a terrific all around value. After several recent visits, I can say that this sweet little restaurant never fails to impress. Best dining experience on St. Clair West! We love you guys!  It seems that the Toronto Star agrees! http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/1006422--pataki-atlas-one-in-hillcrest-blends-latin-and-italian-dishes  Update: Sadly, Atlas One is no more. It has a new name, new owners and new staff. The food is just okay; ditto for the service. They are getting more people in the door, but it seems that sugary pop tunes, coupled with cute bartenders and waitresses are the draw nowadays. We miss you Anthony!!!"}
{"text":"I've known the proprietors of Ferro, The Rushton and Atlas One since they were kids and/or babies. Really!!! I have to admit, I've never eaten at Ferro's. Seems busy all the time. I have eaten at The Rushton a couple of times, and, it too, is always rockin'...As far back as I remember, this family treated food like it was \"the national treasure\" and it shows based on their successes.  Last night, I had the opportunity to check out Atlas One, which is the latest rendition of one of the family members. It is just a matter of time before this spot becomes \"HOT\" too.  I'm not a big eater, so I like tapas style. This place offers tapas. Cool!!! My wife, my 2 kids and I ordered 6 different dishes.  In short, each one was fresh, inventive and extremely Italian. I especially liked the pasta, which was clearly homemade. And, the meatballs  were nicely seasoned and complemented the pasta perfectly. If you like spicy, ask your server for some of the \"hot stuff\". Kicks up the taste a wee bit!!!  In any event, service was very good and unpretentious. The wine list was short with decent variety. Had no room for dessert. All in all, I can't wait to go back. And I don't say that lightly (or often). It's another winner."}
{"text":"Went to atlas one for brunch and was hopeful about the menu, liked the decor, but the food just wasn't good. The goat cheese in the omelette overpowered the other tastes, the sausages tasted gamey, the coffee was bland. Though Boom further down the street definitely doesn't have the ambiance (it's packed like a sardine can), the brunch options are so much more tasty."}
