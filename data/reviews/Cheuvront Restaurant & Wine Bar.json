{"text":"We had a long layover and wanted a place to sit and relax, have dinner and a drink. We chose this place, not knowing the airport - made a great choice. Had the bacon and blue burger and the harvest salad. Food arrived to the table quickly (it was a slower time of day) and everything tasted great. Also enjoyed a glass of Zin and a Sierra Nevada. Service was pleasant and friendly. Prices are in the higher end but it's at the airport, so nothing extra ordinary."}
{"text":"Expensive, but nice place to enjoy a glass of wine before or after your flight.  Large bar with a decent wine list...not sure why they offer so many by the bottle vs. instead of everything by the glass.  Friendly service, nice atmosphere and good drinks!"}
{"text":"I come here regularly when I'm flying out, the drinks are decent.  Drawback is that the service is SLOW. If you want more then a drink, get here when you're crazy early.  Food is basic, sandwiches and hotdogs. Meh."}
{"text":"Oh gosh.  That feeling when you make a bad decision and you can change your mind but you follow through with said bad decision.  I left the gate area because my flight was delayed and the terminal was crowded for this \"wine bar and restaurant.\"   The menu is nothing short of yucky.  The wine list is melancholic at best.  Unfortunately the service (even though I ordered a bottle of wine and sat at the bar) did not help make me feel welcomed or worthy of the overall theme of melancholy.  Yes, yes there were signs - there were signs! But I was hoping for the best...   The big screen tv's did not help - gosh i loathe the din of big screen tvs when I am just trying to chill out."}
{"text":"Small little bar and eatery pre-security.  As a coworker and I were heading to different gates we decided to stop in here for a quick dinner before we took off.  The service was okay, maybe a little slow in initially getting us menus and drinks serve.  I went with the Meatball Sandwich and have to say for an airport restaurant it wasn't half bad.  If you need some food outside of security, this is a decent option."}
{"text":"So very disappointed the wines by the glass very  mundane, no variety all most all chardonnay  California with no variety. what wine bar serves Kendall Jackson. Was a great wine bar in the day now it plactes itself to  the uneducated palate. So disappointed servers uneducated as well....."}
