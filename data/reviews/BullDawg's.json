{"text":"Definitely a fun menu .. something for everyone.   who doesn't like a hot dogs, hamburgers, steak hoagies or fries!!  Good quality too.

The fries are definitely up there with one of the best i have had.  Steak hoagie was fresh and delicious.   Prices are slightly above average. .. more convenient so its worth it."}
{"text":"Great Dogs! Snappy frank's on great bread. All condiments are top quality. Burgers are d'licious as well, uses fresh good beef. Cheese steaks as well are top quality. Favorite food truck in the burgh. When this truck is at a brewery it makes the beer taste better."}
{"text":"So I have had Bulldawg's a couple of time in the past and yesterday I was at Grist House and finally realized how much I appreciate them! I love hot dogs. LOVE. But I have a huge gripe about most shops around the city...they all have these great hot dogs...awesome toppings...and then this sad little bun that isn't anything special. I ordered a hot dog that had bacon, bbq and provolone on it...gosh....it was soo incredibly good and the best part? the chewiest hot dog bun. I mean...formidable. I respected that bun. The hot dog is also really quality as well. The toppings were well balanced. I loved every second."}
{"text":"Got to try this restaurant courtesy of Uber eats app. I ordered a BBQ hot dog, The cheesesteak and loaded fries. First thing I inhaled was the Hot dog.  The flavor from how it was cooked was so good i didnt want to put it down. Second thing i tried was half of the cheesesteak. It was tender, juicy and the bread choice was perfect. Last, i tried some of the loaded fries. I wish i had ordered more cheese but the taste was fantastic."}
{"text":"With many food trucks to choose from at the food truck festival at the Meadows casino, this is where we ended up. Definitely something on the menu for everyone. My XXX hot cheesesteak was delicious and different. It was made on exceptionally good bread. My wife's burger was so so she said. Again it was different. Fresh cut fries were good but many many small pieces. Could've used a fork to eat them but didn't have one. Food was made in a timely matter. Items were priced good. Service was great, helpful, and friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious dogs and fries. Organic grass fed pure beef with generous toppings and servings. All fresh ingredients. 
Burgers are plump and juicy full of flavor too."}
