{"text":"I've been going to Jonathan's for 15 years.  I heard back in the day, this was considered one of the top restaurants in Ontario. I think I said that 20 times or more to my clients when they have been to town and I've taken them there.  Over the past years, my frequency has become less, and I haven't been for about a year now. Reason for the lack of support from my end was the brutal service on my last visit.  And i was tired of the same decor and wicker seats year after year. The last visit resulted in The first 8 bottles of wine I ordered were all out of stock. I commented that they could just easily reprint the wine list with what was in stock, instead of wasting my first 30 mins going up and down from the wine cellar looking for my requests only to come back 8 straight times with a \"sorry\".  The waiter actually was getting upset with me as I would not take his recommendation on a different wine.  I then asked what was the point of the wine list then? 

Food has been great over the years, I just think they have fallen back on service and general upkeep of their wine collection. I hope next time, if there is a next time that the service is better, the wine list is up to date, and the food is as good as its always been. Just a shame that they lost my usual 4 visits a year over one night of 8 straight wine bottles ordered and not one was there and a rude waiter.

{"text":"I decided to try Jonathan's for lunch. The menu I was given had prices changed as soon as I walked in.  Prices 25% higher! This is completely unprofessional and even fraudulent. 

I walked out unhappy and don't think I'll be returning here."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 11 people and was accommodated right on time. We were seated in a private room (without needing to request it). Our waiter (Joe? Sorry if your name isn't Joe!) came and greeted us immediately, asked for drink orders, and made recommendations based on our specific requests. He had a great, professional yet personal/humorous demeanor and gave us ample time to decide on our orders.

The food was fantastic all around! The scallops appetizer was yum - very fresh. Our party covered most of the bases (AAA steak was perfectly cooked as requested, lamb chops were said to be great as well as the salmon and seafood dish, and the duck was very moist and flavorful).

I'd definitely go again for both the service and food!

Also TIL shirley temples are non alcoholic. Oops."}
{"text":"It was such a lovely Saturday dinner. We were a bit earlier than most other people: right at the opening for dinner (5:30). Most patrons started coming after 7, so we were in almost  empty space. And we liked the space all right. When I've called to reserve the table I was offered a choice of Outside, Bistro, or Dining-room seating. I took the last one.

I won't talk about the details of our meals, but that was French cooking the way it is supposed to be. Very intricate but not overwhelmingly so. Excellent mix of textures and  tastes. Exquisite presentation and temperature (for example the plate with my foie gras appetizer was in the shape of a goose and was properly heated). And the service was there to match, too. 

All 5 items we had ordered and the dessert thereafter were simply superb. So if you are looking for a special French dinner and are prepared to pay certain price for it (like $200+ for three people, which is not cheap but fair) then don't hesitate to call a table over there.

Live music didn't hurt either :)  But I just noticed that online they have only a half of the menu. The whole \"Chef's special\" page is missing, and it had the most amazing dishes we had tried. 

UPD: And one more thing: even if you sit in the dining room you can still order from bistro's menu (we did that with excellent lobster souffle, highly recommended)."}
{"text":"Great place, good service 
The food the menus is very good 
On Eco meant though, DO NOT order steak in there, it was very rare though I specifically asked for medium, and a cheap plate of steak and fries, nothing else on the dish
So disappointed with the steak"}
{"text":"My cousin had her wedding here at the jonathans and I must say it was simply amazing experience. Staff were friendly, professional and food was done perfectly. Kudos to the staff and management team for handling perfect wedding dinner for 100 people!!"}
{"text":"The food and service is generally wonderful whenever I have gone here. A lot of group dinners happen here so it can get loud. But they have a great selection of wine and the food generally doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"This place has been around for quite some time and I never had the chance to try it.  It's in a quaint old historical home in downtown Oakville.  The food, service and staff is really exceptional.   The prices are high but you get what you pay for! A quality place and a very good experience overall!"}
{"text":"Great place located in the heart of downtown Oakville right off Lakeshore Road. It's a very quiet place depending on what day you go but the decor inside seems very homey and welcoming much like a lot of the other small businesses around the area. 

The prices for food were fair. I got steak frites and the steak was cooked perfectly with the butter just melting on top to add some extra flavor to it. The frites themselves were perfectly cooked and had a slight crisp that was not overwhelming. The juices from the steak was just a small hint that added more dynamic flavors to the dish itself. 

I've only come to this place on the weekdays after work. It's not really super packed (depending on weather) so the service was great. Not sure what it would be like if it were full but regardless all the experiences I've had here have been nothing but positive."}
{"text":"We went there for Valentine's day and had an excellent meal.  I had the beef, and it had an absolutely amazing flavor to it, I was thoroughly impressed.  It was better than other similar priced restaurants that have failed to wow me in the past.  Having said that, it is a very expensive restaurant (around $180 for the two of us), one I would keep in mind for maybe once a year on Valentine's day, or an anniversary, or another major occasion.  The service was also a little slow as is usual in finer restaurants, although it seemed to take forever to get some water at the beginning of our meal, but the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Went to Jonathans for our wedding anniversary.
The place seems like having dinner at a living room of somebody's house.
The interior is very nice and it has a very cozy and comfy feel to it which I liked a lot.
The waiters were very nice and courteous too.

We ordered grilled calamari and cauliflower almond soup for appetizers.
Guys!!!!!Like seriously you have to try this cauliflower almond soup.It legit HEAVEN.
For main course,we ordered goat cheese salad and seafood linguine which were delicious too but nothing extraordinary.There was lot of seafood in linguine which I appreciate.

Everything is very pricey though and no main course food item is below 25 dollars.
The appetizers all also all above 12 dollars.
For dessert,we ordered the gluten free chocolate cake which was amazzzzzzing but again very pricey like 17 dollars or something.

Overall, a very pleasant experience and I highly recommend everyone to try it on some special occasion. Definitely not a place where you would go often."}
