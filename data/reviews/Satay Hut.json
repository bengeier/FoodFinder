{"text":"Very delicious blend of spices. Great service! I follow them on FB so I can catch them."}
{"text":"Great skewers, good quality meat, amazing peanut sauce! Owners and employees are wonderful."}
{"text":"First official food truck experience! Coming from the Yelp VIP event at the fanfest... I was still feeling a little hungry... I am always hungry :)  Saw the corner of food trucks and I just had to go and try some finally! Decided to try this one! And I am glad I did.  I got the meal with one beef and one pork skewer satay... And ooh the meat was tender and soft maybe the slightest bit chewy but the seasoning and marinate was on point! It was so flavorful! I was very happy with the dish... Came with a spicy peanut sauce but didnt need it and pickled cucumbers that are way too vinegary but I liked it..also with a salad  Down side was the price 9.25 for that but no drink on the side? Yikes are all food truck food this expensive?   Anyways.. At least it was yummy :)  3.5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Satay Hut was a nice surprise during my visit to Phoenix Chinese Week. The chicken satay was definitely in the Indonesian vein with the larger pieces of chicken. The peanut sauce was okay. I would have enjoyed a little more spice. I ordered it with a meal and enjoyed the achar. It doesn't compare with Mom's but hey as the Teochew Chinese proverb goes, \"When you don't have fish, shrimp will just have to do.\" I also enjoyed the gado gado style salad (peanut dressing with a nice tang). It was the best thing I ate at the festival."}
{"text":"I admit I'm spoiled, I get the food truck experience twice a week since I work at Tempe on Wed. and Downtown Phoenix on Fridays. Satay Hut has been on my to try radar for quite awhile since I first saw them at the Four Peaks fest 2 yrs ago, anywho I got myself the two skewer meal, one Ayam (chicken) and one Babi (pork) with rice. I don't know it got me thinking of chicken bbq on a stick, the filipino street food with the sweet sauce, and eating it with rice is sarap (delicious in filipino)! I know satay since my mom makes it and I grew up in Malaysia, so, I've eaten my fill of scrumptious Malaysian satay... and the peanut sauce along with the spicy cucumber sauce with vinegar, now I'm salivating thinking about it! Anyways, let me regress, I've had Indonesian satay as well which is similar to Malaysian satay but the Malaysian satay is far more delicious. Satay Hut's version is okay. I thought the Ayam was a bit dry but that might be because it's chicken breast, the Babi is better, I think the downfall of my meal was the rice, I could be wrong but it seemed like it was day old rice, not fresh from a rice cooker, it wasn't fluffy. From an Asian perspective, the rice as an accompaniment to the skewers should have been fluffy, this seemed more like an afterthought to the skewers. It's nice there were veggies but that should have been a good scoop of rice. The peanut sauce had no spice, and the cucumbers lacked vinegar and spice again.   Will I try them again? Yea, I'd try the beef satay and the pork but I'd stay away from getting a meal because I was turned off by the rice served. Presentation wise it was pretty but for many Asians taste trumps how something is presented most times."}
{"text":"Just found this little gem via my cousin who urged me to Like on Facebook.  I received a FB notice that the truck would be in Tempe today so I drove over.  The food is good, I had the steak satay meal.  I think that the price is a little high $8.50 for only 2 skewers but maybe because the satay was so good I would have liked 3 skewers for the price.  I hope that Satay Hut eventually has a restaurant because I would definately travel outside the East Valley to eat there."}
{"text":"Had the chicken satay at the Satay Hut. Very good, especially with the spicy peanut sauce that accompanies it.  The peanut sauce could be a lot hotter before they offend anyone but it was still tasty.  Meat was tender but with charred bits. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Quality of the food was great!  I did the build your own meal with pork and chicken skewers and the vegetables side. The vegetables were very basic. No special sauce or anything outside of using the sauce that comes on the sides for the meat. I did enjoy the vinegar cucumber. It was the highlight of the vegetables by far.   The meats were scrumptious and juicy. Even without the sauce it wasn't dry. The portion size was good for $10 bucks and definitely one of the healthier options if you decide to just do veggies on the side."}
{"text":"Attended Food Truck Friday at Park West and this was our first stop. We tried the pork sirloin skewer which was delicious! Tasty marinade, good seasoning and flavorful. Cooked fresh to order. The peanut sauce was pretty good too and I don't normally like peanut sauce."}
{"text":"Satay Hut was at the Gilbert Food Truck Food Court a couple weeks back and even with the tough competition, I decided to get food from their truck. Totally happy I did! My order came out faster than the other people I was with, who were waiting on food from other trucks! Nicely done. The food was really good. I got a meal and I felt it was the right amount of food to be filling but not stuffed. I also really liked they had a vegetarian meal option too!"}
{"text":"The Bali Burger is where it's at! A delicious and  very unique blend of juicy and flavorful ingredients unlike any other. This explosion of phenomenal flavor will make your picky pallette feel euphoric! I loved every single bite! Next time you see Satay Hut, ask for the Bali Burger... Not spicey and not bland but perfection. I LOVE the Bali burger and really I love EVERYTHING I've ordered from S.H. their peanut sauce should be bottled and sold! It's A-MAZE-ING!"}
{"text":"The peanut sauce is actually on point.  Growing up in Indonesia, I was excited to see some of our cuisine finally reach Arizona.  The problem is it doesn't really taste like it.  It's just regular grilled meat with generic tasting sauce.  The rice cake-ish sticky rice is no where to be found when that's usually the company with satay.  It's decent food, it's just not what I was looking for."}
{"text":"I went to Phoestivus last night for the second year in a row (what a great event!) and my s/o and I decided to try satay hut. I got the pork plate, which came with 2 satay skewers, rice, a veggie salad (bean sprouts, beans, bell peppers, lettuce, egg), with pickled cucumber and spicy peanut sauce on the side. There was an option to get fried rice for an extra dollar, but neither of us did that.   I was a little upset because the menu board said \"fried egg,\" and the egg was just sliced and hardboiled, but their menu online is correct to say that it's just sliced egg. Pro Tip: the creamy peanut sauce doubles as a salad dressing ;)   The meat was a little chewy, but the flavors were really nice! The salad added a level of freshness that I don't usually expect, which I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"It's always a good day when a good food trucks comes by your work. So the day I tried out Satay Hut was a good day. I went for the full lunch - two kabobs, rice and salad. I did the mix and match so one chicken and one beef. Both were really tasty but I have to say I liked the chicken slightly better. It was cooked well, not dried out, and tasted really good with the peanut sauce they included. The salad could have used some kind of dressing. The peanut sauce was okay but it seemed like that was really intended more for the meat. I just kind of mixed everything up so it was all good.   The food came out fast and everything seemed fresh. I'd definitely get my lunch from here again."}
{"text":"Delicious! Came to Food Truck Friday and went in thinking I'd get my usual fare, The Bear from Short Leash, but when I saw the menu for Satay Hut, I knew I wanted to order from there. They had four skewer options: pork, beef, chicken and tofu. I ordered the vegetarian meal option, which included two tofu skewers, rice, veggies, hard boiled egg, cucumber salad and spicy peanut sauce. The lady told me it would be ten minutes, but it was closer to 15. It was worth the wait. The flavors were incredible! I love eating sweet, savory and spicy food all together. The peanut sauce was mouthwatering good, and the tofu had a tasty sauce in it. Overall, everything worked really well. A bit steep pricing, $9, and nothing super filling but definitely made fresh to order. I would revisit this truck in the future."}
{"text":"Food Truck Thursdays at Whole Foods Raintree:  Husband had the beef and I ordered the chicken lunch specials. The special comes with 2 skewers, some veggies, rice, and peanut sauce. I really enjoyed my chicken skewers, they were delicious - the sauce was good and the chicken was tender/moist. The steak skewers had good flavor, but the meat was dry, dry, dry. Husband tried to trick me by offering one steak skewer for one chicken skewer, but I declined. The rice was regular white rice, but the skewer sauce made it tasty. The veggies were lacking and minimal. The peanut sauce tasted like peanut butter mixed with chili peppers. Super sweet and suddenly spicy - I don't like spicy peanut butter. Overall, the chicken skewers were good and everything else was just meh."}
{"text":"Never again, I ate here and got the worst food poisoning. Don't risk it,"}
{"text":"Tried Satay Hut when we went down to the Gilbert Food Truck Court this past Friday night.    Ordering - with only 1 customer in front of me, after the gal took her order, she told me that she would be with me in a moment.  5+ minutes pass by.  Did she forget she had customers at her window?  Who knows.  We decide to order from another truck.  However, after we're informed that it will take 30+ minutes to get our food from the other truck, I got back in line for Satay Hut.    Though having your order taken even when you're at the window takes a while, I must say that you do get your order pretty quickly.    We got a pork and a beef skewer.  The beef was tough, dry, and definitely overcooked.  Seriously a good thing I have all of my teeth.  I didn't bother giving any to Baby C.  The pork was not as tough, BUT it was extremely fatty.  And the peanut sauce was nothing to write home about - probably peanut butter with some type of chili sauce mixed in.  Really overpowering.    At $3.50 a pop - I doubt we'll be getting satay from here again."}
{"text":"Good food...they have skewers with small combos with a small salad and rice...peanut sause has a little kick. ."}
{"text":"Tried this food truck when they parked outside of Four Peaks Tasting Room on April 20th, 2013. It was pretty good! Not out of this world or anything--but definitely good with some beer.  The reason I stopped here is because Dutch fused with Indonesian sounded intriguing to me. The pork skewers were kinda dry and the peanut sauce didn't taste much different than something I could find in a can, but I still like the flavor of the spices used in the cooking process.  As far as the service goes--I know that some folks on here were dissatisfied but the interaction with them was minimal so I don't really have much bad to say. Food was ready in a minute or two and then I parted ways with the noisy truck. I'd definitely recommend this to someone if they were parked in a busy area."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Combo basket w/ pork is very good with high quality items.  Two things; 1. The meat is hard to get off skewer.   This is probably because portions are so generous. 2. I would prefer more vegetables (green beans and peppers very good).  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Had the beef kabob & tofu kabobs. Peanut sauce had a kick & paired with the kabobs perfectly!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, very friendly people. Will defnitely returm. Discovered Satay Hut my accident by browsing the Phoenix Truck Directory. They are at GoAz  Motorcycles every third Thursday of each month from 11:00 am to1:30 pm. I am glad they exist as I am a sucker for satay. The food is fresh and hot takes about 10 minutes to prepare.  I had the Satay meal which includes two grilled skewers, steamed rice, cucumber salad, vegetables and spicy peanut sauce which was to die for  Thank you Satay Hut for a wonderful experience. Looking forward to seeing you next month. Satay!"}
{"text":"I tried the satay meal with 2 chicken satays and it was great! The chicken was nicely marinated and came with several sides to make it a meal. The woman taking orders was very friendly and the food was made within 10 mins of ordering. The meal was $9, a little much for a small lunch meal but it was pretty filling and tasty!"}
{"text":"Was hoping another time would be better, No. I ordered the plain white rice with chicken & pork skewers hot off the grill.  The chicken was good but the pork skewer just seemed hard not tender or juicy. Maybe its not the right cut of Pork, but yeah I wasn't impressed. Today is carb day and I was excited to eat white rice since I only have once every other month. It wasn't cooked enough or had that day old taste where the rice drys up and is hard. Disappointed for $11, not worth it and Ill be avoiding this food truck."}
{"text":"I tried the pork and chicken skewers and loved them! Very moist and cooked just right. The sauce had a great flavor and the edges were nice and crispy. The meat was excellent quality cuts with no funky bits."}
{"text":"I was a customer of the Satay Hut food truck at an event this weekend.  I really hate to rain the parade they have, but the satay was not great (meat was too chewy).  This is in regard to Satay Ayam and Satay Babi.  They were overcooked.  I happen to be a fan of Malay and Indonesian cuisine, with Balinese and Javanese being my favorite styles.  From what I remember through my many trips through Jakarta, Riau, Singapore, and Malaysia, the satay that I had did not live up to the quality."}
{"text":"Tasty food, fast, and friendly service! Food truck owners work hard at balancing a fast paced kitchen in a very confined space all while maintaining their mobile restaurant. Satay Hut has proven to be exceptional in all of these areas. As you approach the truck you can see its stylish red, orange, and green paint scheme as a creative foreshadowing of the dedication that this crew puts into their food and service. You are greeted with friendly smiles from their chefs and intoxicating aromas from their culinary creations.   I recently perused their menu during a Food Truck Friday at the Downtown Phoenix Public Market. They offer skewers of meats for a value price, as well as, meal options with many extras. I got their Satay Ayam meal. Included in the meal were two marinated chicken skewers with sides of steamed rice, fresh vegetables, sliced egg, atjar (sweet/spicey cucumbers), and their signature peanut butter sauce. Quite a refreshing lunch!  Food truck owners need to cram as much business as they can into a couple of hours, typically during a lunch or dinner rush. They also focus on a couple of menu items that are unique to that truck. This usually makes the creative quality of food very high. Satay Hut has demonstrated this quality very well and I look forward to my next meal from this terrific truck!"}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite food trucks since it is both yummy and healthy. Really the only complaint I have is that the portion sizes are a little small. The concept is basically marinated meat on a skewer served with some rice and a little salad. All of it has great flavor already but to top it off you get a delicious peanut sauce for dipping."}
{"text":"I rolled up to the downtown food truck affair that occurs every Friday and took notice of this interesting concept, Dutch-Indonesian.    The name of their game is meat skewers, nothing too fancy.  If you ever had Satay Chicken at a Thai place, then you're not missing out.    For $3 a skewer, that's not too terrible I guess.  During this visit, they ran out of rice, so getting a combo was out of the question.  I went ahead and opted for a Beef and Chicken skewer--came with a spicy peanut sauce.  The taste didn't really stand out telling you that you should try it again.  The overall menu is very limited.  When it comes to Asian cuisine, I always expect the flavors to just pop with a generous portion.  The biggest plus is that they have cheap protein on a stick but they fell short in the flavor department.    My personal preference with food truck is--you need to bring your A++ game, the one or 2 item that can draw a crowd.  For instance, Short Leash Dogs' hot dog on a naan with interesting toppings."}
