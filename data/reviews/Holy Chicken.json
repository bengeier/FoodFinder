{"text":"Do NOT try this restaurant.  The chicken is okay, but they serve powdered mashed potatoes and powdered gravy.  The coleslaw is pre-chopped and the sauce is added later.  I asked for the vinegar flavoured coleslaw, so cabbage was doused in vinegar and strangely, pepper.  The biscuits were not impressive."}
{"text":"So we decided to give this place a try. 3 of us got a family combo with 8 pieces, creamy coleslaw and biscuits; plus a side of onion rings.  Chicken: hot and fresh, but greasy and lacking in flavour. The breading almost had a light 'panko breadcrumb' like texture but wasn't really flavoured with any spices so was rather so-so.. we each had 2 pieces and no one went for the leftovers later, so that's saying something.  Creamy coleslaw: not bad, but clearly premade. Looked like it came out of a vat of coleslaw. It was a refreshing palate cleanser to the greasy chicken, but I wouldn't really chow down on it on it's own.  Biscuits:  YUM! fluffy and delicious  Onion rings: they were ok. Frozen pre made rings so nothing to write home about, but if you really need rings, go for it.  bottom line: Order the biscuits and then walk over to City chicken (2 min walk) for some far superior, delicious, flavourful chicken!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken tenders combo. The fries were pretty good and the chicken was crispy. There was no spice at all to the chicken so I had to dip it in the hot sauce they provide for free at the counter. With a drink and a side, my total came to $7.90. They had a daily special but they couldn't combine it with the combo to save me $0.50. The value deal here would be the loaded chicken wrap. It's a wrap with one piece of chicken tender, fries and lettuce. It's $2.99 plus tax. There was little air con but they did have a fan running. I'd do take out if possible on a hot day. Pretty ok overall. Will have to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"Unlike other fried chicken places where the order is premade, your order is made fresh here.  I waited about 7-10 mins for my 3 piece chicken.   With things made to order, this obviously provides the chicken a fine tasty crisp   and hotness to the meat.  It's a great little neighborhood place for fried chicken."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place late on a Friday strolling on Danforth. It was open late and I was hungry.  Tried the chicken bowl, which was similar to KFC's version, but not as good. So it was rice, gravy, corn, cheese and bits of fried chicken, plus a lot of siracha bc I got the \"spicy\" version. Pro, made fresh. Con, chicken lacked spice and was bland. Hence why they drench it in sauces and gravy...."}
{"text":"Love the fried chicken from this place. Crispy, a bit spicy, and a good value. Think Popeyes but better quality. Spicy chicken sandwich is my go-to, has some real heat. Biscuits are also A+"}
{"text":"Superb, flavorful, fresh, value for money, and friendly! Their attention to detail is clear in every bite."}
{"text":"amazing crispy, non-greasy chicken.  the chicken must be soaked in something magic to make something so simple taste so good.  my new go-to fried chicken place.  the fries and biscuits are fine/good/really good but the chicken! go for the chicken.  some of the dips for the fires ... have them with the chicken.  tasty, crispy stuff. what more do you need?  adult beverage?  take your chicken with you to the only.  sit on the patio.  drink cider, eat chicken.  best city life combo!"}
{"text":"Holy chicken is right, people! Should I keep the churchisms going or is that weird? Hashtag blessed? Nah. Weird.   Today I attended a child's birthday party in a park and these fine people delivered us loads of crispy fried chicken, biscuits and 'slaw. To a park. Nice, right?  Biscuits were simple and buttery, 'slaw was mayo-y heaven and the chicken was perfect. I especially liked the spicy version, a nice kick but not too much. If you give a cluck about bird, try Holy Chicken."}
