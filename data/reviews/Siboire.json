{"text":"Had a drink here after a food tour in Mile End with the group. Friendly service, nice interior."}
{"text":"Excellent choix de bière. La InsPirAtion est une des meilleures bières au Québec!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hey une micro-brasserie avec de l'humour, bien lumineuse et qui donne envie se s'y rendre !   Avec la réputation qui la précédait, pas étonnant de voir le monde s'amasser et de devoir s'aligner pour rentrer. Pas trop grave, il y a des tablettes et tu peux boire un verre en attendant d'être installé... que demande le peuple? Je n'ai pas senti la pression du personnel lors de ma venue personnellement, que du contraire.. mais je reste sur ma fin au niveau de leurs bières - je suis Belge hé ! -, tout en approuvant les nachos et les frites !   Si boire nous tente (alerte jeu de mots pourri), on retournera avec ma gang pour donner une 2ème chance à leurs bières ! Burps !"}
{"text":"A get together with colleagues. Gets crowded even in weekdays. Need to reserve in advance.  They offer a variety of beers special to Siboire. Not too loud and you can hear each other talking. The food menu is rather limited. I had smoked mean but did not like it. Staff friendly and helpful with explaining their  menu. Finally the prices are fair."}
{"text":"Popped in here for a quick beer with my hubs on a sunny afternoon.  I really liked the triple I ordered and also enjoyed the beer my husband got (can't remember what it was). Service was nice and they were happy to bring samples before committing to a full glass.  Loved the sunshine in the giant, open space.  Seems like a fun place to hang at night!  If you stop in, don't miss Dieu de Ciel just down the road! Another great place for beer lovers."}
{"text":"My first stop in Montreal and this place did not disappoint. The belgian tripel was fantastic and the fish-n-chip (3 different fish) was the best I've ever had. All the staff was friendly and attentive. A definite 'must visit' in a great corner building."}
{"text":"Rare combination of excellent craft beer, friendly service, cool vibe, and great views of the park."}
{"text":"Belle et grande micro-brasserie ouverte depuis peu, au coin Laurier et St-Laurent Large choix de bières très originales, j'en ai goûté quelques unes en mode dégustation La bière à l'érable est vraiment très bonne, forte, on dirait un mélange de bière et de whisky genre! Elle est servie en verre seulement (6$) Possibilité de réserver des tables de groupe dans la salle du fond (qui n'a pas de fenêtre et est un peu sombre) Nous y sommes allés un jeudi soir en groupe et je dois dire que le service était plutôt décevant (très long...), j'espère qu'ils vont s'ajuster à ce niveau! Merci!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our stop here for a beer! The space is huge and well decorated for an industrial-style brewery. I loved all the growlers in the washroom area!  Beer selection was good - seems like they might specialize in Belgian beers. I had a fruity belgian beer that was on special, and my sister enjoyed the Tripel. Service was great.  It was fun to be able to stop here and Dieu du Ciel in one trip. Will be back and will try the food next time!"}
{"text":"New place with their own brews just accross from Dieu du ciel! It just opened so it quickly got packed and people started queuing, which means that if you're already inside, you will be pushed to finish, pay, get up and leave thank you... And it gets very loud - between the people inside and the cars outside, not a place for a quiet conversation for sure. The beers are good - no more - and the selection is very basic. Same goes for the food, basic selection and expensive (13$ for a tiny pizza). We got the poutine and a fish and chips (it's apparently their specialty) - the fries were not good and neither was the poutine sauce. The fish was ok. I'm glad I tried it as I can now check it off my list, but I'm not sure I'll go back..."}
{"text":"What a great find! I was looking for bar in the area and this place was absolutely perfect! It's big, offers plenty of beer options and the service is excellent! We only had drinks this time so I'll go back and try their food. The Capricieuse beer is amazing, light and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Great place for 5à7. This place is big. They have a private area for all kind of events. We were around 30 people. The staff are courteous, helpful and I was really surprised they remember our names. Each of us had to give our name to help them remember our orders. I ordered the fish &chips because I heard this is their speciality. I must say, i really liked it. Many people in my group took the same and they were not disapointed at all. Great recommendation. If people were to ask me where they would do their 5a7, i would recommend this place for them."}
{"text":"I like to go there where there is nothing going on at night.  Nice and huge place to have a beer or cider. Their menu is big and not that expensive.  The ambiance is casual not really chill The best: dry cider at 4$"}
{"text":"Fun bar ! A lot of space for guest because theres is also a room in the back so we didn't wait long in line to get seated even if we came there a saturday night. Like other reviews, was hoping to go to Dieu du ciel but since it is always full(never went because of that) we decided Siboire was a good alternative and we enjoyed a lot. Good fries."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was going to Diex du Ciel, but it wasn't open, and I was craving a beer after a long, hot walk. Turned out to be good problem, because the beer was delicious, the space was big and open, and the young women that work there were amazingly efficient and friendly. I had the Inspiration IPA, and the blueberry sour, and both were great - didn't try the food, but the service will bring me back."}
{"text":"I tried the one in Sherbrooke, liked it, so I was happy to see one opening in Montreal. Coming here made me feel back in Sherbrooke. A lot of Québécois, warm welcome, good beer. It's a pretty nice place to hang out with friends and even if it gets crowded you can always find a good place to seat."}
{"text":"Nice open space to go during Summer. The beer menu is great and the menu is pretty varied. We ordered the fish an chips the portion was a pretty good sized. The fish was really well seasoned, bu the chips a bit too oily."}
{"text":"Fantastic beers.  Bartenders are all super nice and helpful.  The Belgian Tripel is awesome.  Didn't try any food, but would definitely do so next time."}
{"text":"Really cool vibes here! The road-bike decor was fun. One or two of the more popular beers had run out (this was on a Sunday night), which was a bummer. The fish and chips were incredibly tasty though; I was blown away! The staff was incredibly helpful in describing the beers and offered suggestions."}
{"text":"J'ai attendu un peu apres l'ouverture afin de tester car à chaque fois que je passais devant c'était bondé. Nous avons fait un anniversaire et nous étions plus d'une dizaine et il y a eu aucun souci de place.  C'est vraiment un endroit avec un joli cadre et une belle décoration. Un peu de mal a comprendre les vélos au plafond mais il y a surement une raison.  Le choix de bière est relativement intéressant (meme si j'ai connu plus de choix) et bien présenté et avec des infos sur l'amertume ou autre. En plus de cela le personnel connait bien les différences. Coté nourriture je n'ai pas trop regardé mais je sais que la poutine et les Nachos etaient bons."}
{"text":"C'est un bar très en vogue en ce moment, j'y suis allé pour l'anniversaire d'une amie et le bar était plein mais heureusement on avait fait une réservation. La bière est très bonne et pas trop dispendieuse par contre concernant les plats les portions ne sont pas très généreuse. La musique est un peu trop forte vu que le bar était plein ils ont sûrement augmenter le son, ce qui était pas la meilleure des idées. Le service était très agréable et super rapide."}
{"text":"Great local brewery. Picks up a lot of the flowover from folks trying to get into Dieu de Ciel. I actually tried to go to DeC but it was closed and Siboire was open. The bar looking like it might have been an old bank or factory building so there is lots of exposed brick and steel beams. On cool feature is that they use road bike frames as light fixtures. There is a lot of seat in the main room which is great especially if you can get seat near one of the large 12ft windows which slide open for a cool indoor outdoor drinking experience. The day I went, it was raining pretty hard out side but no water can in and it was still cool. I imagine on a nice day its even better. The beers were really good and they had a interesting seasonal sour blueberry beer which was created with the assistance of the local university's engineering club, how's that for random? Siboire also serves cocktails and has food though the menu is a bit limited. The food is better than average pub food but by no means fine dining. You're there to drink the beer remember. There is also free wifi that works really well which is a bonus for out-of-towners. It seemed like the place is frequented by locals so it does not have a touristy vibe. All in all a great place to hang out while in the Mont-Royal Plateau."}
{"text":"I was watching this place for a while since its on my bike route and close to my house. Now that the huge lines of the first 1-2 weeks are gone I decided to visit with some friends. 1. Getting in and finding a place - easy. Much easier than Dieu Du Ciel (DDC, which is just across) 2. Beer selection. Not huge BUT good spread of styles, not as big or adventurous as DDC yet very nice and the beer is good. 3. Price around 4$ a glass or 6$ a pint. Descent for a micro-brew. 4. Noise - not bad. We had a nice conversation and a good time.  Small issues : no out room setting and I was disappointed they dont sell bottles to bring home.  This was just added to the list of close to home pubs which I will visit a lot this summer."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Clean, spacious, and not noisy. The food were amazing. Large portions and delicious. Loved the soup of the day (Crème of broccoli with curry). The staff were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"It is impossible to get a seat in Dieu du Ciel on weekends with a group and here is your planB if you're really thirsty!! - Ciboire one block from there which promises you micro-brew, huge space, fun crowd, perfect noise level (DDC is too loud to talk on weekends) and fast service! It's a predictable big hit after grand opening, HOWEVER, it is not a 5 star because it is not Dieu Du Ciel, where I will 'baptize' the beginning of each summer with that cold pint of Rosee d'hibiscus on their terrace with Maple flowers flying over your table. The red here is ok, the blonde is better, and my friend tried a blueberry one that doesn't taste much blueberry (there's a blueberry floating in it, so pyschologically that helps!) and another friend took a light beer (3.5%) that tastes like water-down Corona. Again, Ciboire is for thirsty people who just really want some quality time with friends over a normal beer. Can't be too picky either on weekends :) Still highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fish and chips were awesome! I got the variety of three dishes and liked the white fish more than the salmon but were all Bomb! Comes with generous portion of fries. Charcuterie plate was really good too with great selection of smoked meats. Husband got a smoked meat sandwich which was just OK. Irish red ale was great!"}
