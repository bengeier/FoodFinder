{"text":"Stopped by for the first time when they posted up at Saigon Plaza. Looked at the menu online before hand and was intrigued. After the underwhelming Cleveland Flea event we at first just got the cheesy tots. God damn were those amazing. Crispy AF on the outside and soft and cheesy inside. Yum Yum sauce is just the best idea ever for those. Loved them. 

For whatever reason decided to try a burger. Split a big girl with the lady. I loved it. It came out super fast but the meat was cooked spot on. The sauce seemed like a tartar sauce of sorts. But what do I know. Whatever it was worked and tasted good. 

Definitely will hit this truck up again if I come across it. Could have done without the off-putting attitude of the lady taking my order."}
{"text":"I tried the \"Fokker\" burger today. Way too much sauce, low quality meat, and I found a long hair in my burger half way through eating it (hair nets anyone?). Not sure how the reviews are so high for this place - should have went with the Mexican food truck parked next to it."}
{"text":"These burgers really are the bomb. 

We stopped by Betty's Bomb Ass burgers at the opening weekend of the Cleveland Flea. The staff members were enthusiastic and friendly, despite seeming to be a little overworked and managing windy and cold weather. We ordered the \"Sterling\" burger, which was \"heavy on the protein,\" as my husband put it. It featured double burger patties, egg, cheese, and a delicious yum yum-like sauce. The pickles were crisp, which always lets me know that the burger was truly made fresh to order. 

We also ordered a side of Bacon Bombs (tots with bacon), but I am pretty sure they gave us the regular Cheezy tots instead. Oh well, still were delicious. We will have to insist on the bacon ones next time. If you're at the Cleveland Flea, check out Betty's Bomb Ass Burgers!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burgers I have ever had!  I wish I could take Betty's Bad A** Burgers with me to California. I had the \"Dominator\" which includes: hamburger patty, pulled pork, fried onion rings, a BBQ sauce with a slight kick of a spice (not too spicy), cheese, and I believe a special sauce.  This with a side of of tots...best meal in town!"}
{"text":"Betty's burgers are bad a**. Hands down the best burger I have had in a long time. 

Walnut Wednesday is food truck day at work. Normally I am not a burger type guy. Not that I don't enjoy a good burger, just that it is hard to find a worthy one to really enjoy. 

Enjoy it I did. I got the Boomerang. Beef patty, brisket, kraut, thousand island and a few other things. Awesome combo. It was like having a Reuben on steroids. 

You pay nine bucks for a burger everywhere downtown. But this on is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Served brunch menu at Red Horse Winery in Barberton. We tried everything except the chicken & waffles & all was awesome.  They weren't serving burgers today but we'll definitely catch them somewhere in the area when they do!"}
{"text":"The toppings! The Gladiator burger with the beer battered mozzarella chunk was such a good choice on my part. The mozzarella was so amazing I could eat a burger just made of that. And the tater tots aren't just topped with cheese, there is cheese intermixed with the potato. A good deal too since I was full after half of it and ate the next half the next day. It would be nice if they got a website but pics and menu can be found at the facebook - https://www.facebook.com/BettysBombAssBurgers"}
{"text":"heard great things - was eager to try and buy some to go as well for at home but they cancelled the day of our event we had them scheduled here at work  ?

left a lot of folks hungry who didn't pack lunch in anticipation for the food truck today - total bummer."}
{"text":"There is NO better burger. ANYWHERE!! Betty's has the best. When you see her around, go there immediately. You'll friend her on facebook just so you too can become a Betty groupie just like I am. Each year her menu changes a little bit, and oh my god does it change for the better!!!! I don't know how she does it but the burgers get better and better!!"}
{"text":"This food truck is aptly named. The burgers are truly bomb ass! They have a big variety of burger concoctions, all extremely unique. I asked the food truck lady (Betty herself perhaps?) the most popular burger on the menu since it was my first time. She said it was the Boeing Fortress, which is a burger toppes with peanut butter, bacon jam, peppered strawberry preserves and jalepenos. I was slightly intimidated by this seemingly odd mix of ingredients but overcame my fears and ordered it.

WOOOOOOO! You take a bite and get a barrage of flavors. The odd mix of ingredients creates a symphonic masterpiece, whisking away your palette on a melodic adventure. Sweet from the jam, salty from the peanut butter, fatty from the meat and spicy from the jalepenos - this burger elegantly touches on so many glorious flavor patterns.

Tip: use a knife and fork. Burgers are too big and juicy to be of the handheld variety."}
{"text":"Well played Betty!

A food truck delight. I had to walk past a few favorites to try a burger, but I had a hankering and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Found this food truck hanging out at Walnut Wednesday.  Wow, these burgers are insane!  This is not your typical cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato.  Got the Hawker Typhoon, which was a huge burger packed to the rim with an egg, bacon jam, onions, jalapeno, tomato confit, lettuce, cheese, yum yum sauce (I think it's mayo-based), ketchup and an extra patty made up of their wonderful tater tots.  The tots are a bit expensive on their own, so I would definitely suggest getting this burger instead.  It could barely fit into my mouth but it tasted amazing.

One of my friends tried the boomerang, expecting a brisket sandwich and getting a burger with brisket piled up on top of it. They loved it too."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of having one of Betty's Burgers at the Cleveland Flea. I had the Big Girl and tater tots with Yum Yum sauce. First off the tater tots were amazing!!! I mean true you only get 4 but they are so delicious I would gladly buy them again. There burgers are legit. The big girl was huge but it was so good that I didn't want to stop eating it. I would gladly go back to this tuck again and again Lol."}
{"text":"This fun food truck made a visit to my workplace yesterday and the food was fabulous, service was great! I had the spitfire vegan burger and it was tasty and a tad (perfectly) spicy! 

SPITFIRE (VEGAN BURGER) -- Black bean, carrot, roasted corn and pea burger with braised onions, tomato, pickles jalapeno, vegan garlic and basil aioli and mesculin. 5 stars! 

Can't wait to eat here again :)"}
{"text":"I agree with other reviews- the name fits. Bomb ass Burgers is right. 

I love their creativity! They have so many different kinds of burgers. Check out their menu!

I had the boomerang burger and some tots. They hit the spot. Love the sauce on the tots too.

The line was pretty long at their foodtruck, but I can see why."}
{"text":"Burger is decent, but the cheesy tots (6 small tater tots for $4) WAY overpriced. Will pass next time."}
{"text":"Not sure I get a better burger in the city of Cleveland. Portion size is perfect, and they are very speedy in their service. I also recommend the Tots if it's a cheat day for you."}
{"text":"We had them when we visited Red eagle distillery in Geneva.  These burgers are amazing! I had the vegan burger and tots. It was so full of flavor.  My husband and brother had the a meat burger and they said it was the best burger ever"}
