{"text":"Quite pleased with this little place. Pizza is good & the owners are attentive. The House Salad isn't just a side salad, it's a meal itself with good mixed greens, etc."}
{"text":"The family are now raving fans of this place.  Disappointed that it took us so long to find this little gem in our back yard.  

Bought 4 pies for a team meeting @ work here locally.  Still getting questioned 'where was that pizza from?'.....also raving fans.   

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just had this pizza tonight. It's seriously not even close to being good. The ingredients of the pizza taste very cheap as well as the quality. Now I understand why it's so inexpensive. Upgrade your ingredients Jen & maybe charge a bit more for your pies. Little Caesar's taste better than this pizza. And I hate Little Caesar's. So that's how bad this is."}
{"text":"Really good pizza! We ordered a supreme pizza and wings. We watched everything being made fresh - from the dough to the sauce for the wings! It was so good, I wish I had come hungrier than I was! Can't wait for leftover pizza in the AM!"}
